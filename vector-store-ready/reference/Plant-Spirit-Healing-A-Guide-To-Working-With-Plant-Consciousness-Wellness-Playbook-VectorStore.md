### Core Principles

* **Spiritual ecology**

  * The world is an “environment filled with spirit”: everything—humans, plants, landforms, weather—is animated by spirit and participates in a shared field of relationship. 
  * Our health depends on recognizing, maintaining, and nurturing this web of relationships rather than seeing ourselves as separate or dominant. 

* **Plants as conscious, multidimensional beings**

  * Plants have heart, soul, and spirit, not just physical bodies and chemical constituents. They are intelligent, responsive allies that can communicate and heal at source level. 
  * Working only with plant chemistry treats symptoms; working with the full being of the plant shifts consciousness and allows deeper healing.

* **The triple spiral path: heart, soul, spirit**

  * Healing follows a spiral path through heart (primary organ of perception), soul (the connecting link), and spirit (vital life-force and animating principle). 
  * All three levels exist in plants and people, and true healing engages them together.

* **Heart as primary organ of perception**

  * The heart is not only a pump; it’s the center of perception, where we feel connection, meaning, and love.
  * Positive impulses to the heart—beauty, gratitude, kindness, plant connection—nourish our entire system and anchor spiritual experience into daily life. 

* **The power of your inner story**

  * We constantly tell ourselves an internal story about who we are and what life is; this “continuous internal monologue” either nurtures or harms our relationship with spirit. 
  * Harsh, self-attacking stories create inner war, distort biology, and contribute to illness and despair; compassionate, truthful stories restore coherence and peace. 

* **Soul, soul contracts, and soul loss**

  * The soul links heart and spirit and carries our unique essence and agreements (soul contracts).
  * Trauma, neglect, or chronic spiritual malnourishment can lead to soul or spirit loss—parts of vitality withdrawing to avoid pain. 

* **Spiritual malnourishment**

  * Many modern people are “spiritually malnourished”: outwardly functioning but inwardly empty, disconnected, and without meaning.
  * Symptoms include deep sadness, numbness, addiction, chronic dissatisfaction, and a sense of being “less than” or incomplete. 

* **Plants as the most accessible avenue to healing**

  * Plants surround us, grow where we live, and respond to our attention; they are always offering healing and guidance. 
  * Because plants co-evolved with animals, their medicine speaks fluently to our bodies, psyches, and spirits. 

* **Co-creative partnership**

  * Humans are not masters of nature but one family member among many; healing comes from working *with* plants as equal partners. 
  * In co-creative partnership you ask, listen, and follow plant guidance rather than imposing your own agenda.

### Practical Playbook

#### Relationship with Spirit & Spiritual Ecology

**What to do**

* See your life as part of a larger spiritual ecosystem of Earth, plants, animals, and invisible forces.
* Treat all your relationships—human and more-than-human—as spiritually significant.

**How to do it**

* Regularly spend time in wild or gardened places and address the land and plants as beings: greet them, thank them, and listen inwardly for responses. 
* Reflect on how your daily choices (work, consumption, speech) affect the web of life, not just your own comfort.

**Why it matters**

* Recognizing spirit everywhere restores a sense of belonging and meaning that counters modern isolation and meaninglessness. 

---

#### Inner Story, Soul, and Spirit Loss

**What to do**

* Become conscious of the story you repeat about yourself and life.
* Identify patterns of self-attack, victimhood, or hopelessness that drain spirit.

**How to do it**

* Notice your “running commentary” throughout the day; write down recurring phrases and beliefs. 
* Ask: *Does this story nourish my heart and soul, or starve them?*
* Begin to “rewrite” your story with statements that are honest yet compassionate and aligned with your deeper nature (for example, from “I’m broken” to “I’ve been wounded, and I’m learning to heal”).

**Why it matters**

* Your internal narrative directly influences biological function, mood, and openness to healing; changing it re-aligns you with spirit instead of reinforcing spiritual malnourishment. 

---

#### The Essential Nature of Plants

**What to do**

* Relate to plants as beings with their own intelligence, feelings, and purposes.
* Seek to know plants as whole persons—body, energy, and spirit—not just as “remedies.”

**How to do it**

* Spend unstructured time with individual plants (in gardens, forests, city lots) simply observing and sensing, without immediately harvesting or using them. 
* Practice talking to plants out loud or silently, as you would to a wise friend, and notice impressions, images, or feelings that arise. 

**Why it matters**

* Approaching plants as persons opens channels for communication, guidance, and healing that go beyond the physical body.

---

#### Dreamtime and Shamanic Work with Plants

**What to do**

* Learn to enter the “dreamtime” or non-ordinary reality where plant spirits and inner guides can be encountered. 
* Use simple shamanic journeying or dreamwork to receive teachings from plants.

**How to do it (core journey)** 

* Prepare a comfortable, quiet space; lie or sit with eyes closed.
* Use steady drumming or another monotonous sound to shift consciousness.
* Visualize yourself descending (for example, down a spiral staircase, tunnel, or roots) into a natural place that feels safe.
* Call in a wise inner guide and then invite the spirit of a specific plant to appear in any form (human, animal, plant, light, etc.).
* Ask simple questions, then listen, feel, and observe rather than forcing images.
* When the drumming changes (or at a set time), thank the plant and guide, retrace your path back, and fully return.

**Why it matters**

* Dreamtime work bypasses ordinary mental filters and allows direct experience of the “invisibles” that are central to plant spirit healing and to deep shifts in meaning and behavior. 

---

#### Building Relationships with Plants

**What to do**

* Choose individual plants as teachers and companions, not just resources.
* Develop sensual and energetic awareness with them over time. 

**How to do it**

* **Sensual awareness practice** 

  * *See*: Study the plant’s shape, color, posture, and how it holds itself in space.
  * *Touch*: Gently feel leaves, stems, bark, and soil; note textures and temperatures.
  * *Smell*: Inhale the plant’s scent at different times of day or season.
  * *Hear*: Sit quietly and listen to subtle sounds—wind through leaves, insects, any inner “tones” you perceive.
  * *Taste*: Where safe and appropriate, taste tiny amounts (or teas) with full attention to flavor and body sensations.

* **Observation through cycles**

  * Watch the plant at different times: morning/night, different seasons, before/after rain; note changes in mood and presence.
  * Record impressions, dreams, and synchronicities related to the plant.

* **Co-creative partnership & reciprocity** 

  * Ask plants for permission before harvesting or working deeply with them.
  * Offer something back (song, water, compost, prayer, tending the place).
  * Follow intuitive nudges about how the plant wants to be used or approached.

**Why it matters**

* Long-term relationship with specific plants builds trust, deepens guidance, and creates a living context for all healing work with them.

---

#### Healing Self, Others, and Planet

**What to do**

* Invite plant spirits to act as personal guides, not only as medicines.
* Work with them for your own healing, then extend that relationship to help others and the Earth. 

**How to do it**

* **For yourself**

  * Ask which plant wishes to guide you at this time; notice repeated appearances in dreams, walks, readings, or conversations. 
  * Spend dedicated time with that plant (in person or in journey/dream) asking how it can help you heal specific patterns.

* **For others**

  * Before working with a client, ask plant spirits for guidance on root causes, not just symptoms.
  * Allow the image, name, or feeling of a particular plant to arise as you listen to the person’s story. 
  * Combine physical preparations (tinctures, teas, baths) with spirit-level work (journeys, plant baths, energy clearing) as directed by the plant.

* **For the planet**

  * Engage in rituals or offerings with plants on behalf of damaged places (polluted rivers, clear-cuts, etc.), asking how you can assist their healing.
  * Recognize that your personal healing contributes to the healing of the Earth's larger spiritual ecology.

**Why it matters**

* Plants respond to sincere requests for help and often “show up” where needed; working with them as guides weaves personal, community, and planetary healing into one continuum. 

---

#### Building Personal Power

**What to do**

* Build spiritual stamina and courage so you can meet life (and healing work) without collapsing into fear.
* Use specific rites—night walking, fire vigil, vision journey, sweat lodge—to strengthen your relationship with spirit. 

**How to do it (overview)**

* **Night Walking**: Walk alone at night in a safe place without artificial light, engaging directly with the night world and your fears. 
* **Fire Vigil**: Keep a fire through the night in prayerful vigil, tending flames as you tend your inner light. 
* **Vision Journey**: Undertake a period of solitude and fasting on the land to receive vision and guidance. 
* **Sweat Lodge**: Participate in a traditional sweat ceremony (with appropriate guidance) to purify body and spirit and renew commitment. 

**Why it matters**

* These practices increase your capacity to stay present in discomfort, meet the invisible world with respect instead of fear, and stand firmly in your own power. 

---

#### Foundational Healing Modalities

**What to do**

* Use established energetic frameworks—Chinese Five Elements, chakra system, medicine wheel—to understand patterns and direct plant spirit healing. 

**How to do it (brief)**

* **Chinese Five Elements** 

  * Recognize that each person has a primary element (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) that shapes their gifts, challenges, and typical imbalances.
  * Notice key indicators—color, sound, odor, emotion, and demeanor—to sense someone’s primary element.
  * Work with plants and practices that support the out-of-balance element (for example, supporting flexible growth in stagnant wood, discernment and warmth in fire, nourishment and boundaries in earth). 

* **Chakra system**

  * Understand chakras as spinning centers of energy corresponding to different life themes (survival, creativity, power, love, expression, vision, unity). 
  * Use plant spirits and specific techniques (like chakra clearing, plant baths) to restore flow where energy is blocked. 

* **Medicine wheel** 

  * Work within a four-directional model (often East, South, West, North) representing stages of life, elements, and qualities.
  * Place plants, people, and issues within the wheel to see imbalances and call in balancing forces from the corresponding directions.

**Why it matters**

* These frameworks provide maps for understanding complex energetic patterns and help you choose appropriate plants and practices more precisely.

---

#### Plant Allies in Practice

**What to do**

* Work deeply with a small number of plant allies that choose you.
* Let each ally teach you its specific gifts, personality, and healing specialty over time.

**How to do it**

* **Recognizing plant allies** 

  * Notice which plants keep “showing up” in your life—growing by your path, appearing in dreams, books, or conversations.
  * Approach these plants respectfully and ask if they are willing to be your ally.

* **Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris, douglasiana, tridentata) as exemplar ally** 

  * **What it offers**: Support for dreamtime and psychic perception, boundary setting, balancing womb and reproductive energies, and smoothing the aura.
  * **How to work with it**:

    * Sit or journey with Mugwort asking for help with clear seeing or protection.
    * Use appropriate physical forms (such as teas, smokes, or baths) as you are guided, while maintaining an explicit agreement that you are working with its spirit as well as its body.
  * **Why it matters**: Mugwort “opens the gates” between worlds while strengthening your ability to stay centered and protected.

* **Other allies**

  * The book profiles Sacred Basil, St. John’s Wort, Calendula, Trillium, Hawthorn, Dandelion, Angelica, Agrimony, and Rose, each offering distinctive emotional-spiritual gifts (such as heart protection, joy, cleansing, or boundary repair). 
  * You are encouraged to discover their specific teachings through relationship, not merely by reading.

**Why it matters**

* Plant allies offer continuous, personalized guidance, becoming long-term companions in your healing and service.

### Protocols & Checklists

#### 1. Core Daily / Weekly Practices

**Daily (or near-daily) essentials**

1. Spend at least a few minutes consciously with a plant (houseplant, street tree, wild weed, garden plant).
2. Greet it as a being; offer gratitude or a simple blessing.
3. Listen inwardly for any feeling, phrase, or image that arises.
4. Notice your internal story that day; gently correct the harshest statements.
5. Before sleep, invite a plant ally or guide to visit your dreams.

**Weekly essentials**

* Take a longer walk or sit spot in a natural place.
* Journal about plant encounters, dreams, and shifting inner stories.
* Once a week, do a more formal practice (journey, plant bath, chakra clearing, etc.).

---

#### 2. Shamanic Dreamtime Journey (with Plant Spirit)

1. **Intention**: Choose one clear intention (e.g., “Show me how to heal my fear,” “Teach me how to work with you for my digestion,” etc.).
2. **Set and setting**:

   * Quiet, safe space; low light.
   * Lie or sit comfortably; cover yourself if needed.
3. **Sound**: Use steady drumming or another repetitive sound to shift into non-ordinary awareness. 
4. **Descent**: Visualize traveling down through a passage into a natural place that feels real and alive.
5. **Guide**: Call in a wise inner guide (human, animal, ancestor, or light) and ask them to accompany you.
6. **Plant spirit**: Invite the spirit of a specific plant to appear; wait patiently for any form or sensation.
7. **Dialogue**:

   * Ask simple, heartfelt questions.
   * Listen with all senses; avoid forcing images.
8. **Completion**: When it is time (drum change or inner sense), thank all beings, retrace your path back, and fully re-enter ordinary awareness (wiggle fingers/toes, open eyes).
9. **Integration**: Journal what you experienced; look for themes, images, or instructions that repeat over time.

---

#### 3. Night Walking

1. Choose a familiar, safe outdoor area where you can walk at night without artificial light.
2. Set an intention (for example, “to meet my fear of the dark,” “to listen to the night world,” or “to strengthen my courage”). 
3. Go alone and in silence; avoid flashlights unless absolutely necessary.
4. Walk slowly, letting your eyes adjust; use all senses to navigate.
5. Notice emotional reactions (fear, awe, curiosity) and breathe through them instead of turning back at the first discomfort.
6. When done, thank the land and night beings, and take time afterwards to ground (water, food, journaling). 

---

#### 4. Fire Vigil

1. Prepare a safe fire site and gather enough wood for the full vigil. 
2. Choose a time (often dusk to dawn) and a clear purpose (healing, guidance, honoring the dead, planetary prayer).
3. Open with a prayer, naming your intention and inviting plant spirits, ancestors, and allies.
4. Tend the fire throughout the vigil; do not leave it unattended.
5. As thoughts, memories, or emotions arise, offer them to the fire, asking it to transform what no longer serves.
6. At the end, formally close: thank all beings, safely extinguish the fire, and carry a symbolic coal or ash (physically or in imagination) as a reminder of your inner flame.

---

#### 5. Vision Journey (Solo Time on the Land)

1. Choose a safe natural place where you can be alone for a set period (hours to days) with appropriate support and cultural guidance. 
2. Simplify: limit food (possibly fasting if appropriate), technology, and tasks; focus on listening.
3. Set clear intentions and bring minimal tools (water, shelter, journal, possibly one plant ally preparation).
4. Spend most of your time sitting, observing, praying, and listening to the land and plant spirits.
5. Note any visions, dreams, animal encounters, weather shifts, or plant messages.
6. On returning, share your experience with a trusted listener and consider concrete life changes that emerge from it.

---

#### 6. Sweat Lodge (with Appropriate Guidance)

1. Participate only with experienced leadership and in a respectful cultural context. 
2. Before the lodge, clarify what you are releasing and what you are calling in.
3. Enter the lodge in a humble, prayerful state; sit where directed.
4. Through rounds of heat, steam, and prayer, offer your fears, griefs, and intentions to the spirits and ancestors.
5. Afterward, rest, hydrate, and integrate; notice changes in your body, emotions, and dreams.

---

#### 7. Chakra Clearing

1. Sit or lie comfortably; center with a few deep breaths. 
2. Starting at the root chakra, bring awareness to each chakra in sequence (root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, crown).
3. At each center:

   * Notice sensations, images, or emotions.
   * Ask a plant ally to help clear and balance that chakra.
   * Visualize the plant’s color, scent, or presence bathing that center in light.
4. With each exhale, release stagnation or heaviness; with each inhale, draw in the plant’s supportive qualities.
5. When complete, thank the plant allies and rest quietly for a few minutes.

---

#### 8. Spiritual Plant Bathing

1. Identify your intention (cleansing, protection, heart-opening, grief release, etc.). 
2. Ask which plants wish to participate; this can come through intuition, journey, or simple sense of “rightness.”
3. Harvest small amounts of the plants respectfully, with permission and offerings.
4. Prepare a strong infusion or decoction and strain it into a tub, basin, or bucket. 
5. Bathe or pour the infusion over your body (often from head downward), maintaining focus on your intention; allow emotions or images to arise.
6. Let yourself air-dry or pat dry gently; return leftover plant material to the Earth with thanks.

---

#### 9. Seeing and Working with the Energy Body

1. **Seeing/feeling the field** 

   * Soften your gaze when looking at a person, animal, or plant; notice subtle light, colors, or sensations around them.
   * Use your hands a few inches from the body to feel temperature, density, or tingling changes.

2. **Cutting cords & clearing “bad vibes”** 

   * Sense where draining cords or sticky energies attach.
   * Ask a plant ally to help dissolve or cut cords; you might visualize leaves, roots, or a plant-made blade doing the work.
   * Afterward, fill the cleared areas with the plant’s light and qualities (e.g., protection, sweetness, strength).

3. **Healing the past**

   * Journey or meditate with plant spirits to visit key past events or ancestral patterns. 
   * Offer the pain to the plants and ask for a new pattern to be planted in its place.

---

### Frameworks & Models

#### Triple Spiral Path (Heart–Soul–Spirit)

* **Heart**: Primary organ of perception; seat of love, meaning, and connection; must be nourished by beauty, joy, and honest feeling.
* **Soul**: Connecting link between heart and spirit; holds contracts and personal destiny; can lose pieces (soul loss) when overwhelmed. 
* **Spirit**: Vital life-force and animating principle; when recognized and nurtured, it brings aliveness, creativity, and purpose.

The healing journey spirals repeatedly through these levels: opening the heart, retrieving and realigning the soul, and rekindling spirit.

---

#### Spiritual Ecology

* Life is a web of visible and invisible relationships; plants, humans, and the Earth exchange not just matter but meaning and spirit. 
* Ignoring spiritual ecology (treating the world as dead matter) leads to ecological crisis and personal meaninglessness.
* Recognizing spiritual ecology re-roots us like a tree in soil, restoring flow between inner and outer worlds. 

---

#### Chinese Five Elements (as Applied Here)

* **Wood**: Growth, vision, flexibility; linked to liver (architect/strategic planner) and gallbladder (decision maker). When stagnant, leads to rigidity, aggression, addiction, and blocked creativity. Key medicine: flexibility and “going with the flow.”  
* **Fire**: Joy, passion, union; linked to heart (emperor), small intestine (discrimination), pericardium (heart protector), and triple heater (warmth and balance). Imbalances show up as insecurity in love, manic/depressive tendencies, burnout, or scatter. 
* **Earth**: Nourishment, home, caregiving; linked to stomach (granaries/rotting and ripening) and spleen (transport of nourishment). Imbalances show as over-care for others, worry, stickiness, scarcity mentality, and difficulty setting boundaries. 
* **Metal & Water** (briefly referenced) carry themes of essence, inspiration, structure (metal) and depth, fear, will, and flow (water). Together, all five elements form a family of “officials” whose harmony is the goal. 

---

#### Chakra System

* Seven main chakras map to life themes: survival, sexuality/creativity, personal power, love, communication, vision, and unity. 
* Imbalances in chakras (over- or under-energy) manifest as patterns in body, emotions, and behavior; plant spirits can be invoked to balance each center.

---

#### Medicine Wheel

* A circular map with directions (e.g., East, South, West, North) representing stages of life, elements, qualities, and beings. 
* Used to locate people, issues, and plants in a relational field and to call in balancing energies from under-represented directions.

---

### Guardrails & Caveats

* **Respect the invisibles**

  * Invisible forces (feelings, meaning, spirit, plant intelligence) are central to this work; do not dismiss them simply because they are not measurable. 

* **Beware spiritual malnourishment**

  * Chronic emptiness, meaninglessness, and disconnection signal spiritual malnourishment and possible spirit loss; do not ignore these signs or mask them only with physical treatments. 

* **Inner story can harm or heal**

  * A hostile internal story (“I’m worthless,” “nothing will work”) can sabotage healing even with strong plant allies; part of the work is changing this narrative. 

* **Protection without paranoia**

  * The book emphasizes that nothing can harm you unless you give it authority; stand in your own power and clearly say “you have no authority over me” to any intrusive force. 
  * Over-fixation on “protection” can itself feed fear; balance clearing and boundary work with trust and connection.

* **Frameworks are supports, not rigid systems**

  * Five elements, chakras, and medicine wheel are offered as frameworks; you do not have to use all (or any) of them if your plant relationships guide you otherwise. 

* **Cultural respect**

  * Practices like sweat lodge and certain ceremonies come from specific traditions; they should be approached with humility, permission, and proper guidance, not casually appropriated. 

* **Experience over belief**

  * Understanding will always be partial until you *experience* plant spirits; reading is a doorway, but sustained practice and relationship provide the real learning. 

---

### Key Terms & Concepts

* **Plant Spirit Healing**: Working with the heart, soul, and spirit of plants (not just their physical parts) to heal the heart, soul, and spirit of people and the Earth. 
* **Spiritual Ecology**: The network of relationships between beings and spirit in both inner and outer environments.
* **Dreamtime**: Non-ordinary reality accessible through dreams, journeys, and altered states, where plant spirits and other beings communicate more directly. 
* **Soul Loss**: Partial withdrawal of a person’s soul or essence in response to trauma or chronic disconnection, leading to numbness, depression, or fragmentation. 
* **Spirit Loss / Spiritual Malnourishment**: Dimming of the inner flame of spirit due to lack of meaning, love, and connection; often accompanied by addiction, despair, or a sense of being “less than.” 
* **Co-creative Partnership**: Working with plants as equal partners, asking for guidance, and following their lead in healing work. 
* **Plant Ally**: A plant that forms an ongoing, personal relationship with you, offering specific guidance and healing on many levels. 
* **Energy Body**: The subtle field around and through the physical body that can be seen or felt as light, sensation, or emotion; often the first place where imbalance appears.
