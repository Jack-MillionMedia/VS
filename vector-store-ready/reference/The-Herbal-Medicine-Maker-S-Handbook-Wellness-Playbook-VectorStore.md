### Core Principles

* **Herbal medicine-making is for everyone.**
  Herbalism is presented as a “people’s” tradition rooted in all cultures; it belongs in homes and communities, not just clinics and companies. Making your own remedies is framed as fun, affordable, and empowering, helping you reclaim skills your ancestors used daily. 

* **The making is part of the medicine.**
  Working with plants—digging, garbling, shaking tinctures—supports health by bringing joy, movement, creativity, and a sense of connection to Earth’s “perpetual abundance.” The process itself boosts morale and, by extension, vitality and immunity. 

* **Respect, gratitude, and attention to detail.**
  One “rule of good herbal medicine-making” is to harvest plants with “profound respect and deep gratitude,” and another is to “pay attention to detail” in identification, harvesting, and preparation. These attitudes protect both plants and people and improve the quality of the medicine. 

* **Non-harm and heart-centered practice.**
  Green emphasizes principles like avoiding harm to oneself and others, basing practice on empathy and appreciation, and refusing to participate in research or production that relies on cruelty or confinement of any species. These social and spiritual principles sit alongside the practical ones. 

* **Herbs as food-medicine tonics.**
  Properly made infusions and decoctions are treated as concentrated herbal foods that supply active constituents, basic nutrition, water for hydration, and fodder for beneficial gut flora, forming a foundation for immune health. 

* **Learn the basics, then create your own way.**
  The book offers “short lists” and core procedures, encouraging you to master fundamentals and then adapt, improvise, and explore. Students become masters by stepping beyond the teacher, experimenting, and keeping good notes. 

* **Plants as partners, not products.**
  You’re urged to see plants as “allies” and “plant spirits” rather than mere raw materials, to form relationships with local species, and to join conservation efforts such as learning about “at-risk” medicinal plants and adjusting harvesting accordingly. 

* **Kitchen-scale, empirical, and playful.**
  Medicine-making is likened to dancing and children’s play: simple tools, basic ingredients, and a willingness to experiment. The book favors hands-on, empirical learning over rigid technicalism, while still drawing on pharmacy standards for measurements and methods.

---

### Practical Playbook

#### Getting Started & Mindset

**What to do**

* Approach herbal medicine-making as a creative craft you can grow into over time.
* Start with one or a few herbs and a single preparation (often a simple tea or tincture) rather than trying to master everything at once. 

**How to do it**

* Begin with a hands-on project—such as making a Dandelion tincture from a plant you harvest yourself—before reading every chapter; learn by doing. 
* Treat the book’s processes as “starting places” and allow your own ideas and preferences to evolve as you gain experience.

**Why it matters**

* A playful, experimental attitude reduces intimidation, helps you actually make things instead of just reading, and keeps the work personally meaningful and sustainable over time.

---

#### Choosing & Knowing Your Herbs

**What to do**

* Focus on a small “working dispensary” of versatile herbs you can get to know deeply (e.g., common local plants like Dandelion) rather than chasing every exotic remedy. 
* Learn to identify your herbs accurately in the field: appearance, habitat, seasonal patterns, and non-toxic lookalikes. Dandelion is used as a model plant for careful observation and identification. 

**How to do it**

* Observe each plant’s:

  * Leaves (shape, size, texture, hairiness)
  * Flowers (color, structure, flowering season)
  * Stems (hollow or solid, branched or unbranched)
  * Roots (taproot vs fibrous, color, sap)
* Use botanical names where possible to avoid confusion (e.g., *Taraxacum officinale* for common Dandelion). 

**Why it matters**

* Accurate identification prevents dangerous mistakes and helps you understand which plant parts and growth stages carry specific actions and strengths.
* Building a relationship with a few common herbs creates confidence and a stable base for more advanced work.

---

#### Harvesting, Drying & Storing

**What to do**

* Harvest plants at appropriate times and in appropriate places: clean sites, away from pollution, and at stages of growth when medicinal potency is high (e.g., young Dandelion leaves as food-tonic). 
* Treat harvesting as a respectful, reciprocal act, leaving enough plants to sustain the population and future harvests.

**How to do it**

* Before digging or cutting, pause to recognize the plant and your intention; some instructions explicitly connect harvesting with gratitude and recognition of the plant’s contribution. 
* Use a “Harvesting Information Chart” to record:

  * Plant name and part(s) collected
  * Location, date, and weather conditions
  * Stage of growth and any notable features
  * How you processed and stored it
  * Observations on quality and future adjustments 
* Dry herbs in conditions that protect color, aroma, and constituents: good airflow, moderate warmth, no direct sun, and low moisture.

**Why it matters**

* Ecologically sensitive harvesting prevents overuse of wild populations, especially species listed in “at-risk” compilations. 
* Good drying and storage practices maintain potency and prevent mold, pests, and nutrient loss, so your preparations actually work.

---

#### Home Apothecary Setup

**What to do**

* Assemble a basic set of kitchen tools that double as pharmacy gear instead of buying specialized equipment. 

**How to do it**

* Useful items include:

  * Canning jars and bottles with tight-fitting lids
  * Measuring spoons, kitchen scale (ideally metric-friendly)
  * Funnels, strainers, cheesecloth or muslin for pressing
  * Non-reactive pots (see below), ladles, and labels
* Expand your “lab” gradually as your practice grows, based on your own experience rather than long shopping lists. 

**Why it matters**

* Simple, familiar tools lower the barrier to starting and keep herbalism grounded in everyday life rather than specialized, inaccessible environments.

---

#### Extraction Basics & Solvents

**What to do**

* Understand extraction as “herb + menstruum + time”: different solvents pull out different constituents and require different handling.

**How to do it**

* **Water** (infusions, decoctions): Excellent for minerals, many vitamins, mucilage, and a wide range of plant constituents; also provides hydration and supports gut flora. 
* **Alcohol** (tinctures): Especially good for alkaloids, many glycosides, resins, and constituents less soluble in water; also preserves well.
* **Mixed water–alcohol**: Dissolves a broader spectrum and is standard for official tinctures (often around 60% alcohol, with at least 45% alcohol and herb:menstruum ratio ≥1:4). 
* **Vinegar, wine, glycerin**: Alternative menstrua used for certain traditional preparations, lower-alcohol options, and cases where vinegar’s acidity or glycerin’s sweetness are desirable.

**Why it matters**

* Matching solvent to herb and desired effect improves extraction efficiency, stability, and safety of your preparations.

---

#### Water-Based Preparations: Infusions & Decoctions

##### Infusions (Herbal Teas)

**What to do**

* Use infusions for lighter plant parts (flowers, leaves, some soft roots) and for constituents that might be harmed by prolonged boiling—especially volatile oils.

**How to do it (hot infusion, general pattern)**

* Coarsely grind or chop the herb.
* Unless otherwise specified, use roughly 1 part dried herb to 20 parts boiling water by weight/volume. A standard pharmacy example uses 25 g dried herb with 500 ml water to make one pint of infusion. 
* Pour boiling water over the herb in a pre-warmed, non-reactive vessel (glass, porcelain, glazed earthenware).
* Cover the container to retain volatiles and allow the herbs to steep for the recommended time (conceptually long enough to exhaust soft tissues without over-extracting starches and proteins).
* Strain, pressing gently if needed. Use fresh; infusions are typically made for immediate or same-day use.

**Dosing**

* Official pharmacy examples: 500 ml infusion of 25 g dried herb might be dosed around 90 ml (3 fl oz) three times per day, delivering ~13–14 g herb daily. Many herbalists prefer more dilute tea—e.g., 3–5 g herb per 250 ml (about 1 cup) of water, three times daily (9–15 g dried herb per day).

**Why it matters**

* Infusions are quick to prepare, highly assimilable, and provide both nutritional and medicinal support while also hydrating the body and feeding gut flora. 

##### Cold Infusions

**What to do**

* Use cold water when:

  * The herb is rich in albumin or other constituents that coagulate with heat.
  * Valuable volatile oils might be driven off by boiling.
  * Unwanted constituents are not extracted well by cold water (e.g., certain tannins), allowing selective extraction. 

**How to do it**

* Soak the herb in cool or room-temperature water for an appropriate period (often several hours).
* Strain; use as directed.

**Why it matters**

* Cold infusions avoid coagulation of proteins and loss of delicate constituents, improving certain preparations (e.g., mucilaginous roots like Marshmallow).

##### Decoctions

**What to do**

* Use decoctions for harder plant parts: roots, barks, some seeds, and dense tissues that are not easily exhausted by simple steeping.

**How to do it (general pattern)**

* Coarsely cut or crush the dried herb.
* Place it in a non-reactive pot (glass, porcelain, glazed earthenware are preferred; iron and reactive metals are discouraged, especially with tannin-rich herbs). 
* Cover with cold water and allow to soak (the book uses a standard 25 g dried herb in 500 ml water as an illustrative ratio). 
* Slowly heat to a boil, then gently simmer with the vessel covered until sufficient constituents are extracted.
* Strain while hot, pressing the marc (plant residue) to recover as much liquid as possible.

**Storage & dosing**

* Decoctions are intended for immediate use, ideally within 24 hours; at most about 72 hours if kept very cool, as starches and mucilage decompose and promote souring and mold. 
* A typical dosage example is a wineglass to cupful (variable) taken up to three times a day, adjusted to age, body weight, and temperament. 

**Why it matters**

* Decoctions apply more heat and time to tough plant material, making otherwise inaccessible constituents available while still respecting their chemistry (starting from cold water helps avoid certain extraction problems). 

---

#### Alcohol, Wine, Vinegar & Glycerin Preparations

##### Tinctures (General)

**What to do**

* Make tinctures when you need a portable, stable, dose-efficient form that extracts a broad range of constituents, including many not fully captured in water.

**How to do it**

* **Definition & range**

  * Tinctures are alcohol or water–alcohol solutions of herbs; officially they contain at least 45% alcohol and an herb:menstruum ratio of at least 1:4. Many herbal tinctures hover around 60% alcohol. 
  * Vinegar, wine, or glycerin can also be used; glycerin-based preparations are often called glycerites/glycerates. 

##### Folk Method (Fresh Herb Tincture)

**What to do**

* Use the folk method when you’re making tinctures for home use and precision ratios are less critical than simplicity and accessibility. 

**How to do it**

1. Chop fresh plant material into small pieces and pack it tightly into a canning jar up to the top.
2. Cover the herb completely with menstruum (commonly 80–100 proof vodka, or a custom mix).
3. Blend the mixture briefly in a high-powered blender to create a smooth slurry (ensuring enough liquid to cover the blades).
4. Return the slurry to a jar, cap tightly, and label.
5. Agitate frequently for about 14 days, then let sit an extra day.
6. Press and filter.
7. Bottle, cap tightly, and label with plant, part, date, and method.

**Menstruum choice (folk)**

* 80-proof vodka (~40% alcohol) is adequate for dried-plant tinctures.
* 100-proof vodka (~50% alcohol) is often preferred for fresh-plant tinctures because plant juices dilute the alcohol.
* Twenty to thirty percent alcohol is generally sufficient to preserve a tincture; higher percentages increase extraction of some constituents. 

##### Weight-to-Volume (w/v) Method

**What to do**

* Use the w/v method when precision is needed (e.g., professional practice, commerce, or careful, reproducible dosing).

**How to do it**

* Understand the key relationships:

  * 1 cubic centimeter (cc) of water ≈ 1 gram, making metric convenient for w/v work.
  * Typical tincture strengths:

    * 1:5 (20% w/v) for most non-toxic dried herbs
    * 1:10 (10% w/v) for toxic/intense herbs
    * 1:2 (50% w/v) for fresh herbs 
* For **dry herb tincture** (maceration):

  1. Powder and weigh the dried plant material.
  2. Prepare a custom menstruum (desired water–alcohol mix), blending all liquids thoroughly before adding to herb.
  3. Combine menstruum with powdered herb, ensuring all is moistened even if some parts look wetter than others.
  4. Cap tightly and macerate, agitating periodically, then press and filter after the prescribed time. 

**Why it matters**

* Clear ratios support consistent dosing, allow comparison between tinctures, and are required for labeling in professional contexts.

##### Wine, Vinegar & Glycerin Infusions

**What to do**

* Use wine or vinegar when you desire:

  * A culinary/medicinal cross-over (wine tonics, flavored vinegars)
  * Acidity to help extract minerals or specific constituents
  * A low- or no-alcohol option (glycerin for children or those avoiding alcohol)

**How to do it**

* The core pattern mirrors other infusions/tinctures:

  * Chop herb, cover with wine, vinegar, or glycerin.
  * Macerate for a set period with occasional agitation.
  * Strain, press, and bottle.
* Glycerin is typically diluted with water (often “dilute glycerin” is used in infusions) to improve handling and extraction.

**Why it matters**

* Alternative menstrua broaden access (e.g., for alcohol-sensitive individuals) and provide different extraction profiles and flavors.

---

#### Oils, Salves, Creams & Topicals

*(The book devotes full chapters to each of these forms; here are the distilled practical themes.)*

**What to do**

* Make oil-based preparations when you want to deliver herbs to the skin and superficial tissues: massage oils, salves, ointments, balms, lotions, and creams. 

**How to do it (patterns)**

* **Oil infusions**

  * Macerate dried (or carefully wilted) plant material in an appropriate oil for a set period, protecting from excessive heat and light, then strain and bottle.
* **Salves, balms, ointments**

  * Blend herbal oils with waxes and sometimes resins or butters to create semi-solid preparations for focused application.
* **Lotions & creams**

  * Combine oil and water phases (often with an emulsifier) to create spreadable, moisturizing vehicles for herbs.

**Why it matters**

* Topicals deliver herbs where systemic dosing isn’t needed or as a complement to internal use, and can be easier for some people to tolerate.

---

#### Baths, Poultices & External Therapies

**What to do**

* Use water therapy (baths, foot soaks, sitz baths) and moist applications (poultices, fomentations) for local circulation, relaxation, and direct application of herbs to tissues. 

**How to do it (patterns)**

* **Herbal baths**

  * Prepare a strong infusion or decoction, then add it to bathwater; soak the body or specific part as directed.
* **Poultices & fomentations**

  * Apply moistened herb mash directly to the skin or wrap cloth soaked in hot decoction around the area; re-warm or reapply as needed.

**Why it matters**

* External therapies often combine heat, moisture, and herbal constituents, giving both physiological and comfort-based benefits.

---

#### Flower Essences & Subtle Remedies

**What to do**

* Prepare flower essences (following the dedicated chapter) when working with emotional or energetic patterns rather than primarily physical symptoms.

**How to do it**

* The book references standard flower essence approaches (e.g., Bach-inspired methodologies) and repertories, suggesting:

  * Selecting flowers intuitively or by repertory
  * Using water, sunlight, and later dilution in brandy or similar preservative
* Details follow common flower essence protocols rather than pharmacological extraction.

**Why it matters**

* Flower essences are used as subtle supports for emotional states; they complement, but do not replace, more physically oriented preparations.

---

#### Formulation, Dosage & Actions

**What to do**

* Think in terms of **actions and indications**—what an herb does and when you would use it—rather than disease names alone. The book includes an “Actions and Indications” section and guidance for a list of 30 core herbs. 

**How to do it**

* When planning a formula:

  * Identify the main action needed (e.g., digestive support, relaxing nervine, diuretic support).
  * Choose herbs whose actions match, considering synergy and safety.
  * Use standard dosage ranges from infusion/decoction examples and adjust by age, body weight, constitution, and sensitivity.

**Why it matters**

* Focusing on actions helps you apply herbs flexibly across different situations and move beyond rigid, one-herb-one-symptom thinking.

---

#### Record-Keeping & Experimentation

**What to do**

* Keep careful records of every preparation and harvest so you can learn from experience and refine your methods over time.

**How to do it**

* Use an “Extract Information Chart” for each batch, noting:

  * Herbal material (name, part, fresh/dry, source)
  * Weight of herb and volume/strength of menstruum
  * Extraction method (maceration, percolation, etc.) and duration
  * Yields, sensory qualities, and any problems encountered
  * Observed effects and adjustments for next time
* Use a “Harvesting Information Chart” to log field conditions, plant population, and ethical considerations as described above.

**Why it matters**

* Structured notes turn scattered experiments into a cumulative, personal materia medica and help ensure reproducibility and safety.

---

### Protocols & Checklists

#### Hot Herbal Infusion (Standard Pharmacy Example)

1. Coarsely grind 25 g (about 1 oz) of dried herb. 
2. Warm a glass, porcelain, or glazed earthenware vessel. 
3. Place the herb in the vessel and pour 500 ml (1 pint) of boiling water over it.
4. Cover the vessel to trap volatile constituents.
5. Steep for the required time (long enough to exhaust soft tissues without over-extracting starches and proteins).
6. Strain and press gently.
7. Dose as directed (e.g., around 90 ml three times daily, or a more dilute 3–5 g herb per 250 ml tea, three times daily). 

**Infusion Checklist**

* [ ] Correct plant & part
* [ ] Proper container (no reactive metals)
* [ ] Covered during steeping
* [ ] Sufficient time, not overheated

---

#### Decoction (General Pattern)

1. Coarsely chop the dried root, bark, or other hard tissue. 
2. Place in a non-reactive pot (glass, porcelain, glazed earthenware). 
3. Cover with cold water (e.g., the illustrative 25 g herb + 500 ml water ratio). 
4. Allow to soak.
5. Bring slowly to a boil; then gently simmer with lid on.
6. Strain hot, pressing out liquid.
7. Use promptly, ideally within 24 hours (up to about 72 hours if kept very cool).

* Do:

  * [ ] Use hard plant parts (roots, barks, some seeds)
  * [ ] Start with cold water
  * [ ] Use non-reactive vessels
  * [ ] Make small batches for near-term use
* Don’t:

  * [ ] Use for herbs whose key virtues are delicate volatile oils or heat-labile constituents
  * [ ] Expect long shelf life without spoilage

---

#### Folk Fresh-Herb Tincture

1. Finely chop fresh herb; pack tightly into a jar. 
2. Cover completely with suitable menstruum (often 80–100 proof vodka). 
3. Blend briefly to form a slurry.
4. Return to jar, cap tightly, and shake.
5. Agitate frequently for 14 days; let rest an extra day. 
6. Press and filter thoroughly.
7. Bottle and label with:

   * Plant & part
   * Fresh/dry
   * Alcohol strength or type of menstruum
   * Date and method (folk maceration)

---

#### Weight-to-Volume Tincture (Dry Herb)

1. Powder and weigh dried herb. 
2. Calculate desired tincture strength:

   * 1:5 for most non-toxic dried herbs
   * 1:10 for toxic/intense herbs
3. Prepare a custom menstruum (water + alcohol mix), blending liquids thoroughly before use.
4. Add menstruum to powdered herb; stir until evenly moistened.
5. Cap the jar and macerate, agitating frequently over the specified period.
6. Press, filter, and bottle; label with full w/v ratio and alcohol percentage.

---

#### First Aid for Poisoning by Alkaloids (High-Level)

> **This section summarizes what the book says; it is not a substitute for modern poison-control guidance or emergency medical care.** 

**Immediate Priorities**

1. **Call for medical help immediately**; poisoning by many alkaloids can be rapidly fatal, so early professional attention is essential. 
2. **Consider remaining poison in the stomach**: some portion may still be unabsorbed and removable.

**Emetic Use (Inducing Vomiting—Book’s Historical Perspective)**

* Warm water is described as a “valuable emetic,” and salt or mustard water are mentioned as traditional options, but:

  * **Never administer an emetic** if:

    * The person is unconscious or deeply drowsy.
    * Corrosive poisons or petroleum products may be involved.
    * A child has ingested multiple unknown substances. 

**Protective Measures**

* The text notes that bland liquids (e.g., milk, egg white mixed with water, starchy fluids) were historically given to coat the stomach in certain poisonings, and strong coffee or tea was used as a stimulant.

**Key Caveat**

* The book presents these measures in a historical context; it explicitly emphasizes the urgency of professional medical care and cautions against delay or overconfidence.

---

### Frameworks & Models

#### Forms of Herbal Medicine (Practical Map)

The book organizes methods into a spectrum of **forms**, each suited to particular plant parts, goals, and contexts:

* Infusions
* Decoctions
* Distilled hydrosols
* Flower essences
* Tinctures (maceration & percolation)
* Wine, vinegar, and glycerin infusions
* Oil infusions
* Ointments, salves, and balms
* Lotions and creams
* Suppositories and boluses
* Herb jellos
* Syrups, honeys, oxymels, electuaries
* Baths
* Poultices and fomentations

Each form is a tool: by learning when and how to use each, you can tailor medicine to person, condition, and context.

---

#### Infusion & Decoction as Food-Medicine

* Infusions and decoctions are framed as **tonic beverages** delivering:

  * Active constituents
  * Nutrients
  * Hydration
  * Substrates for beneficial intestinal flora
* This model positions herbal teas as foundational to everyday wellness, not just symptomatic “remedies.” 

---

#### Weight-to-Volume Ratios for Tinctures

A simple, powerful model for tincture strength: 

* **1:5 (20% w/v)** – Standard for most non-toxic, dried botanicals.
* **1:10 (10% w/v)** – For toxic or intense botanicals.
* **1:2 (50% w/v)** – For fresh undried plants.

This framework links **grams of herb** to **milliliters of tincture**, allowing rational dosing and comparability.

---

#### Process-Based Learning Model

* **Learn principles → experiment → observe → record → refine.**
  Green explicitly encourages:

  * Using the book as a set of “rudimentary building units”
  * Letting your imagination fill in the spaces
  * Growing beyond rote recipes into an art informed by personal experience

---

### Guardrails & Caveats

* **Not a substitute for professional care.**
  The book’s disclaimer states clearly that its information is not meant to replace medical counseling and that self-treatment of medical problems should not be attempted without consulting a qualified health practitioner. 

* **Authority is provisional.**
  Green emphasizes that he is sharing his “current truth,” not absolute truth; readers are urged to question, test, and challenge, rather than passively accept, and to recognize that experts often disagree. 

* **Ethical research and sourcing.**
  You are encouraged to base herbal research on methods that do not involve cruelty or confinement of any species and to be aware of conservation status, especially for plants on “at-risk” lists.

* **Container choices matter.**
  Avoid iron, tinned iron, aluminum, and other reactive metals for infusions and decoctions, especially with tannin-rich herbs; they can cause discoloration and undesirable reactions. Glazed earthenware, porcelain, and glass are preferred.

* **Short shelf-life for teas.**
  Infusions and decoctions spoil quickly due to extracted starches and proteins; they’re best used within 24 hours (decoctions at most ~72 hours if very cool). Don’t prepare large quantities far in advance.

* **Caution with emetics and poisoning.**
  The alkaloid poisoning section underscores the dangers of inappropriate emetic use, particularly in unconscious individuals, children, or when corrosive or petroleum-based substances are involved. Emergency medical help is prioritized over home interventions.

* **Respect individual variability.**
  Doses are guidelines, not commandments; adjustments for age, body weight, temperament, and sensitivity are necessary.

### Key Terms & Concepts

* **Infusion**
  A liquid preparation made by treating plant material with hot or cold water (or sometimes other menstrua) for a given time, especially suited to soft tissues like leaves and flowers.

* **Decoction**
  A preparation made by simmering harder plant parts (roots, barks, some seeds) in water, usually after starting from cold water, to extract constituents not easily drawn out by simple steeping.

* **Menstruum**
  The solvent used to extract constituents from herbs—water, alcohol, vinegar, wine, glycerin, or mixtures thereof.

* **Maceration**
  Soaking a ground or chopped herb in a menstruum until it is fully penetrated and soluble portions are softened and dissolved.

* **Digestion**
  Maceration conducted with mild, continuous heat below boiling, which speeds extraction. 

* **Percolation**
  A method in which menstruum slowly passes through a column of herb, often using specialized equipment; treated in detail in the book as an alternative to maceration. 

* **Circulatory displacement**
  The process during infusion in which denser, constituent-rich liquid sinks and less-dense, unsaturated liquid rises to contact herb, creating natural circulation without stirring. 

* **Tincture**
  An alcohol or water–alcohol solution of herb, usually with at least 45% alcohol and an herb:menstruum ratio of at least 1:4; may also refer to vinegar, wine, or glycerin preparations. 

* **1:5, 1:10, 1:2 (w/v)**
  Standard tincture strengths indicating grams of herb per 100 ml menstruum: 1:5 (20 g/100 ml), 1:10 (10 g/100 ml), 1:2 (50 g fresh herb/100 ml). 

* **Actions & indications**
  A way of classifying herbs by what they do (e.g., diuretic, carminative, nervine) and when they are used (indications), rather than by disease labels alone. 

* **At-risk plants**
  Species identified by efforts like the United Plant Savers list as threatened by overharvesting or habitat loss; the book includes an appendix highlighting these for ethical, conservation-minded practice.
