# Mayo Clinic Drugs and Supplements Overview

Below is a comprehensive overview of each herb, supplement and vitamin listed on the Mayo Clinic’s **“Drugs and Supplements”** page. Each section includes a brief description, what research suggests about potential benefits, safety considerations, and known drug interactions. A concise summary table appears at the end.

## Acidophilus (Lactobacillus acidophilus)

* **What it is / Uses**: A probiotic bacterium that lives in the intestines and vagina. Supplements come as capsules, tablets, wafers, powders and vaginal suppositories, and it is found naturally in some yogurts. People use it to promote gut health, treat digestive upsets and bacterial vaginosis, and to boost “good” bacteria.
* **What research says**: Evidence suggests *L. acidophilus* vaginal suppositories may help treat bacterial vaginosis, and use in infants and mothers might reduce eczema and some respiratory infections. It may lessen antibiotic-associated diarrhea and symptoms such as bloating and cramps.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe for most healthy adults. Possible side effects include constipation, gas, bloating and increased thirst. Those with weakened immune systems (for example, HIV) or premature infants should avoid it. Some products contain lactose.
* **Interactions**: No major drug interactions are known, but users should always inform healthcare providers when using probiotics.

## Aloe

* **What it is / Uses**: Aloe vera produces two components: clear gel used topically for burns, psoriasis, acne and oral lichen planus; and yellow latex that has strong laxative properties.
* **What research says**: Aloe gel can help heal first- and second-degree burns and may modestly help acne and psoriasis when combined with conventional treatments. There is no strong evidence for aloe latex as a treatment for constipation.
* **Safety & side effects**: Topical aloe gel is generally safe. Aloe latex taken orally may cause stomach cramping and diarrhea and can lead to severe kidney damage and potentially fatal complications. High doses may contain cancer-causing chemicals, so latex should be avoided by pregnant or breastfeeding women and children.
* **Interactions**: Aloe (especially latex) can increase bleeding risk when used with anticoagulants or antiplatelets. It may interact with digoxin, diabetes medicines, diuretics, stimulant laxatives, sevoflurane, warfarin and other oral drugs by affecting absorption.

## Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

* **What it is / Uses**: A fat-soluble antioxidant that helps cells produce energy. Levels decline with age. Supplements come in capsules, chewables, liquids and IV formulations. CoQ10 is used for congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, statin-induced muscle pain, migraines and general energy support.
* **What research says**: CoQ10 may improve symptoms of heart failure and lower blood pressure; evidence is mixed for heart-attack prevention. It may help recovery after heart surgery, reduce migraine frequency and duration (requires at least three months of use), and possibly reduce fat accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It does not conclusively improve Parkinson’s symptoms or athletic performance.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe. Mild side effects include upper abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, insomnia and rash.
* **Interactions**: CoQ10 can reduce warfarin effectiveness and increase risk of clotting, so consultation with a doctor is recommended before combining.

## Creatine

* **What it is / Uses**: A compound made from arginine, glycine and methionine; stored in muscles and the brain. Supplements (powders or capsules) are popular for athletic performance, increasing muscle mass and treating creatine deficiency syndromes. Topical formulations are marketed for skin aging.
* **What research says**: Creatine increases muscle strength and power for short-burst activities, may reduce dehydration and muscle injuries, and can help treat certain creatine deficiency disorders. It might improve cognitive performance in older adults and help counteract age-related muscle and bone loss. Evidence for improving heart failure is limited. Topical creatine may lessen fine wrinkles.
* **Safety & side effects**: Likely safe for healthy adults when taken at recommended doses for up to five years. Side effects include weight gain due to water retention and increased lean mass. Use cautiously in individuals with kidney problems.
* **Interactions**: Large caffeine intake (more than 300 mg/day) may lessen creatine’s benefits and might exacerbate Parkinson’s disease progression.

## Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

* **What it is / Uses**: A steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands and a precursor to testosterone and estrogen. Supplements are marketed for anti-aging, boosting libido, improving physical performance, mood and bone density.
* **What research says**: There is little evidence that DHEA slows aging. It may modestly help depression when DHEA levels are low. Results are mixed for osteoporosis or vaginal dryness, and it does not improve muscle strength or physical performance. The NCAA bans DHEA due to its performance-enhancing potential.
* **Safety & side effects**: DHEA should generally be avoided unless under medical supervision. It may increase androgenic side effects (acne, hair growth), lower HDL cholesterol, worsen psychiatric conditions and could stimulate hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast or prostate cancer.
* **Interactions**: DHEA interacts with antipsychotics, carbamazepine, estrogen supplements, lithium, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), testosterone therapy and others. A healthcare professional should be consulted before use.

## Evening Primrose Oil

* **What it is / Uses**: Oil extracted from the seeds of evening primrose, containing omega-6 fatty acids such as gamma-linolenic acid. It is taken for eczema, breast pain, diabetic neuropathy and premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
* **What research says**: Rigorous studies show little to no benefit for eczema, breast pain, diabetic neuropathy or PMS.
* **Safety & side effects**: Likely safe short-term. It may cause upset stomach, loose stools or headaches. Avoid use if you have bleeding disorders, epilepsy or schizophrenia; stop before surgery. Avoid during pregnancy and in hormone-sensitive cancers because it may act like estrogen.
* **Interactions**: May increase bleeding risk when combined with anticoagulants or antiplatelets, and may interact with CYP3A4 substrates (for example, lovastatin), lopinavir-ritonavir and phenothiazines.

## Fish Oil (Omega-3 Fatty Acids)

* **What it is / Uses**: Oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) from fatty fish. Supplements are used for heart health, anti-inflammatory benefits and lowering triglycerides.
* **What research says**: Eating fish twice a week lowers cardiovascular mortality. Fish-oil supplements produce little or no benefit for heart-disease prevention. Strong evidence shows they reduce triglycerides and modestly raise HDL, although they can raise LDL. Supplements may reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (pain, morning stiffness) and may lower the need for anti-inflammatory drugs.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe. Side effects include fishy aftertaste, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea and rash; high doses may increase bleeding risk and possibly stroke. People with seafood allergies should consult their doctor before taking fish oil.
* **Interactions**: Fish oil may increase bleeding risk when taken with anticoagulants or antiplatelets and may affect blood-pressure medicines. Orlistat reduces absorption of omega-3s; contraceptive drugs may interfere with the triglyceride-lowering effect. High doses can lower vitamin E levels.

## Flaxseed and Flaxseed Oil

* **What it is / Uses**: Flaxseed contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), fiber and lignans (phytoestrogens). Flaxseed oil contains ALA but lacks fiber and lignans. Both are used to lower cholesterol and blood sugar and to treat digestive complaints.
* **What research says**: ALA may benefit heart health. Flaxseed may help lower blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Evidence is mixed regarding blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes (flaxseed might help; oil does not). Data on cancer prevention and menopausal symptom relief (hot flashes) are inconsistent. Flaxseed helps with mild constipation.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe when consumed with plenty of water. Large amounts without adequate fluids can cause bloating, gas and diarrhea. Avoid raw or unripe flaxseed (which contains toxic compounds). Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid large amounts. Flaxseed oil may impair clotting.
* **Interactions**: May increase bleeding risk with anticoagulants or antiplatelets and interact with blood-pressure and diabetes medications. The phytoestrogens in flax may interfere with hormonal therapies such as birth control pills and hormone replacement.

## Folate (Folic Acid, Vitamin B-9)

* **What it is / Uses**: A water-soluble vitamin essential for red blood cell formation and healthy cell growth. Found in leafy greens, beans, nuts and fortified foods; synthetic folic acid is used in supplements and prenatal vitamins.
* **What research says**: Folic acid supplements prevent neural-tube birth defects when taken before and during early pregnancy. They treat folate deficiency and may help reduce cardiovascular disease risk by lowering homocysteine levels. Some evidence suggests folate might reduce the risk of certain cancers, depression and autism spectrum disorder, though evidence is inconsistent and not robust.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe. Recommended adult intake is 400 micrograms per day (400–800 micrograms for those planning pregnancy). High doses can cause nausea, bitter taste, loose stools, confusion, irritability or insomnia. Over-supplementation may mask vitamin B-12 deficiency.
* **Interactions**: Folic acid may reduce serum concentrations of anticonvulsant and barbiturate medicines, so individuals taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate or similar medications should consult a physician.

## Melatonin

* **What it is / Uses**: A hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles; production increases in darkness and declines with light exposure and aging. Lab-made melatonin is available in tablets and capsules. It is used for insomnia, jet lag, delayed sleep-phase disorder, circadian-rhythm disorders in blind individuals and Alzheimer’s-related sleep disturbances.
* **What research says**: Melatonin is helpful for blind adults and children with circadian-rhythm sleep disorders, improves delayed sleep-phase syndrome by reducing time to fall asleep, and provides slight benefit for insomnia in older adults. It improves symptoms of jet lag, but evidence for shift-work sleep problems is unclear. Some small studies show melatonin may lessen evening agitation and confusion in Alzheimer’s patients.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe for short-term use. Drowsiness, headache, dizziness and nausea are common. Less common side effects include mild depression, irritability, tremors and abdominal cramps. Avoid driving within five hours of taking melatonin. People with autoimmune disease should consult a physician.
* **Interactions**: Melatonin may increase bleeding when combined with anticoagulants or antiplatelets, interfere with antihypertensive medicines and anticonvulsants, and interact with central nervous system depressants, diabetes medicines, contraceptives, CYP enzymes, fluvoxamine and immunosuppressants.

## Milk Thistle

* **What it is / Uses**: A plant with milk-white leaf veins; its seeds contain silymarin (a flavonoid) with antioxidant properties. It is used to support liver health and to treat type 2 diabetes, dyspepsia and certain liver diseases.
* **What research says**: Milk-thistle supplementation may help lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes and may improve dyspepsia when combined with other supplements. Evidence for treating liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C is mixed.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe. Side effects include diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, bloating, itchiness and headache. Milk thistle may lower blood sugar, so use caution in people with diabetes. Because it may mimic estrogen, it should be avoided in hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer.
* **Interactions**: Milk thistle can affect liver-enzyme metabolism (CYP2C9) and interact with drugs such as diazepam and warfarin. It may increase levels of drugs such as raloxifene, simeprevir and sirolimus, and lower blood sugar if taken with diabetes medications.

## SAMe (S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine)

* **What it is / Uses**: A compound involved in methylation, hormone production and cell membrane maintenance. Available as oral supplements, injections and IV infusions. It is used for depression, osteoarthritis and liver disease.
* **What research says**: Some studies show SAMe may help depression, but evidence is limited by small sample sizes and poor study designs. In osteoarthritis, SAMe appears to provide pain relief and improved joint function comparable to NSAIDs, with fewer side effects. Evidence for liver-disease treatment is not conclusive.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe but may cause mild gastrointestinal upset, insomnia, dizziness, irritability and sweating. People with bipolar disorder should avoid SAMe without medical supervision due to risk of manic episodes. Those with compromised immune systems might risk infection from non-sterile preparations.
* **Interactions**: SAMe should not be combined with antidepressants, antipsychotics, amphetamines, dextromethorphan, levodopa, narcotics or St. John’s wort due to the risk of serotonin syndrome or reduced drug effectiveness.

## Niacin (Vitamin B-3)

* **What it is / Uses**: A B vitamin that helps convert food into energy and maintains healthy skin, nervous and digestive systems. Prescription niacin (nicotinic acid) is used to raise HDL and lower LDL cholesterol. Niacin is found naturally in yeast, milk, meats and cereals.
* **What research says**: Prescription niacin raises HDL cholesterol but has not reduced mortality from heart attacks or strokes. It treats pellagra (niacin deficiency). Over-the-counter niacin supplements are not recommended for heart-disease prevention.
* **Safety & side effects**: Within recommended dietary amounts, niacin is safe. High doses (2–6 grams per day) can cause flushing, dizziness, itching, upset stomach, vomiting, liver damage, gout and high blood sugar. High-dose niacin should be avoided in liver disease, peptic ulcer or severe hypotension, and used with caution in allergies, gallbladder disease, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes and gout.
* **Interactions**: Alcohol increases risk of liver damage and worsens flushing. Niacin interacts with anticoagulants or antiplatelets (increasing bleeding risk), antihypertensive medicines (causing hypotension), diabetes medications (hypoglycemia), hepatotoxic drugs, statins (muscle and liver issues) and zinc (worsens flushing and itching).

## Red Yeast Rice

* **What it is / Uses**: Rice fermented with the yeast *Monascus purpureus*. It contains monacolin K, which is chemically identical to lovastatin. Red yeast rice is used in traditional Chinese cooking and medicine to lower cholesterol.
* **What research says**: Red-yeast-rice preparations with high monacolin K content can lower total and LDL cholesterol. Because it essentially contains a statin, it can produce cholesterol-lowering effects similar to prescription statins.
* **Safety & side effects**: Side effects mirror those of statins and include stomach pain, heartburn, gas, headache and dizziness. Rare but serious side effects include liver damage, muscle breakdown and kidney failure. Some supplements contain citrinin, a kidney toxin. Red yeast rice should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Interactions**: Interacts with alcohol (increasing risk of liver damage), cyclosporine, CYP3A4 inhibitors, grapefruit, gemfibrozil, hepatotoxic drugs, niacin, St. John’s wort and other statins, leading to increased risk of side effects.

## St. John’s Wort

* **What it is / Uses**: A flowering plant whose active ingredients (for example, hyperforin) have antidepressant properties. Used to treat mild to moderate depression, menopause symptoms and somatic symptom disorder.
* **What research says**: Many studies show it can be as effective as prescription antidepressants for mild to moderate depression; evidence for severe depression is limited. Some research suggests benefits for menopause symptoms and somatic symptom disorder.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe for up to 12 weeks. Side effects include anxiety, dizziness, diarrhea or constipation, dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia, headache and increased photosensitivity (sunburn risk).
* **Interactions**: St. John’s wort interacts with many medicines (antidepressants, contraceptives, HIV medications, transplant drugs, anticoagulants, cyclosporine, digoxin and others) due to induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes. It can reduce effectiveness of numerous prescriptions, so users should consult a healthcare professional before combining.

## Tea Tree Oil

* **What it is / Uses**: Essential oil distilled from leaves of *Melaleuca alternifolia* (Australian tea tree). Used topically for acne, athlete’s foot, dandruff, lice, nail fungus and insect bites due to antimicrobial and antifungal properties. NEVER ingest tea tree oil.
* **What research says**: A 5% tea tree oil gel reduces acne comparable to benzoyl peroxide but with fewer skin irritations. A 5% tea tree oil shampoo used for four weeks improved dandruff. A 50% tea tree oil cream may relieve some athlete’s foot symptoms but is less effective than conventional antifungals. It may help against lice when combined with lavender oil; evidence for nail fungus is inconsistent.
* **Safety & side effects**: Generally safe when diluted and used on skin; may cause irritation or allergic dermatitis. Tea tree oil must not be ingested because it can be toxic.
* **Interactions**: None well documented for topical use, but ingestion is dangerous, and caution is advised when combining with other topical medications that could irritate the skin.

## Vitamin A

* **What it is / Uses**: A fat-soluble vitamin (retinol, retinoic acid) essential for vision, immune function, reproduction and cell growth. Present in foods such as spinach, eggs, milk and orange or yellow vegetables and fruits. Beta-carotene (for example, from carrots and cantaloupe) is a precursor. Supplements are available in forms such as retinyl palmitate or acetate and beta-carotene.
* **What research says**: Large doses of vitamin A have no effect on acne. Combinations of vitamins (including beta-carotene) reduce risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration, although the specific role of beta-carotene is unclear. Dietary vitamin A may lower risk of pancreatic, ovarian and esophageal cancers; the effect of supplements on cancer is ambiguous. Supplements do not prevent heart disease. Vitamin A deficiency causes anemia and dry eyes and is rare in the U.S.; supplementation is necessary when deficiency exists.
* **Safety & side effects**: Adequate intake is 900 micrograms per day for men and 700 micrograms per day for women; 770 micrograms per day for pregnant women and 1,300 micrograms per day for breastfeeding women. Chronic high doses (more than 10,000 micrograms per day) or a single very large dose (more than 200,000 micrograms) can cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred vision and potentially liver damage. Excess vitamin A in pregnancy can cause birth defects. High-dose beta-carotene supplements increase lung cancer risk in smokers.
* **Interactions**: Vitamin A may interact with hepatotoxic drugs and some weight-loss medications. A physician should be consulted before combining high doses with other supplements or medications.

## Vitamin B-6 (Pyridoxine)

* **What it is / Uses**: A water-soluble vitamin important for brain development and function and immune health. Found in poultry, fish, potatoes, chickpeas, bananas and fortified cereals. Deficiency leads to anemia, confusion, depression and weakened immunity.
* **What research says**: Studies show that when combined with folic acid and vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6 does not reduce heart disease or stroke risk. B-6 supplements may reduce morning sickness in pregnancy and possibly relieve premenstrual syndrome, though evidence is limited. It treats sideroblastic anemia and prevents adverse reactions to the anti-tuberculosis drug cycloserine.
* **Safety & side effects**: Daily recommended intake is 1.3 mg for adults under 50; 1.5 mg for women and 1.7 mg for men over 50. Vitamin B-6 from food is safe, but high-dose supplements (more than 100 mg/day) over long periods can cause nerve damage leading to ataxia, painful skin lesions, heartburn, nausea and photosensitivity.
* **Interactions**: Vitamin B-6 may reduce the effectiveness of some chemotherapy drugs (altretamine), shorten duration of barbiturates and anticonvulsants, and interact with levodopa used for Parkinson’s disease.
