### Core Principles

* **Wholefoods plant-based (WFPB) is the foundation.**
  Emphasise vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, nuts, seeds and herbs in their least processed forms; minimise or avoid meat, dairy, eggs and highly processed foods rich in sugar, white flour and added oils. A varied WFPB diet provides abundant fibre, phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals while reducing saturated fat and harmful compounds from animal and ultra-processed foods.

* **Food is a root-cause lever for many chronic diseases.**
  The same dietary pattern that supports healthy weight can also improve or sometimes reverse Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, some hormone-related issues (like PCOS and endometriosis), gut problems and inflammatory conditions, by improving insulin sensitivity, lowering inflammation and supporting healthy blood vessels and microbiota.

* **Not all “plant-based” diets are equal.**
  Vegan junk food (cookies, cakes, vegan ice cream, processed meat substitutes) does not confer the same benefits as a diet rich in whole plant foods; for pregnancy and chronic disease, WFPB choices matter more than simply avoiding animal products. 

* **Diversity and fibre are central.**
  A diverse range of plant foods feeds many different “good” gut microbes, supports production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and helps maintain gut barrier integrity, immunity and metabolic health. Fibre slows glucose absorption, improves fullness and can lower cholesterol.

* **Saturated fat and ultra-processed foods drive disease.**
  Saturated fat and excess fat stored inside muscle and liver cells block insulin’s “key”, leading to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes; animal products and heavily processed foods also contribute to AGEs, inflammation and vascular damage.

* **Small shifts can yield rapid, measurable changes.**
  Improvements in glycaemic control, insulin requirements and blood pressure can appear within days to weeks when high-fibre, low-saturated-fat WFPB meals replace a typical Western diet—even if changes start with simple options like plant-based ready meals.

* **Lifestyle factors reinforce the impact of food.**
  Movement, sufficient sleep, stress reduction, nasal breathing, and a sense of purpose all interact with diet to shape metabolic health, immunity and hormonal balance.

* **The WFPB approach is suitable across the life course—if well planned.**
  With attention to key nutrients (especially B12, vitamin D, iodine, iron, calcium and protein), a WFPB diet is appropriate for pregnancy, breastfeeding, children, adults and older people, as recognised by major dietetic associations.

* **Supplementation is targeted, not optional hand-waving.**
  Vitamin B12 is essential for anyone eating WFPB; vitamin D is commonly needed in lower-sun climates, and specific life stages (pregnancy, infancy, later life) require additional attention to nutrients like iron, folate, iodine, calcium and choline.

* **Behaviour change is easier with identity, “why-power” and taste-bud retraining.**
  Seeing yourself as a “plant-powered” person, clarifying your reasons and understanding that taste buds adapt to less processed foods over time makes long-term change more sustainable than willpower alone.

### Practical Playbook

#### Nutrition: Wholefoods Plant-Based Basics

**What to do**

* Base meals on **vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas, nuts and seeds**, with herbs and spices for flavour.
* Reduce or avoid **meat, dairy, eggs, refined grains, added sugars, oils and ultra-processed products** as routine staples.
* Aim for a **“plant power plate”** most of the time:

  * ½ plate vegetables and/or fruit
  * ¼ plate plant-based protein
  * ¼ plate wholegrains or starchy vegetables
  * Water as your main drink, with plant-based milk occasionally.

**How to do it**

* Choose **WFPB building blocks** for each meal:

  * Vegetables: many colours, especially crucifers (broccoli, kale, cabbage).
  * Healthy starches: potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, oats, quinoa, millet, buckwheat.
  * Plant protein: beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas, tofu, tempeh, edamame, nuts and seeds.
  * Fruit: “eat the rainbow”, with emphasis on berries.
* Cook from scratch when you can (soups, stews, curries, grain-and-bean bowls, salads), but recognise that **healthier store-bought options and ready meals can still be a step up** and a helpful starting point.
* When reading labels, **prioritise fibre and low saturated fat**; aim for products with “green or amber” traffic-light labels and avoid “red” labels for saturated fat and sugar.

**Why it matters**

* A varied WFPB diet supplies **essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, polyphenols and fibre** that support blood vessels, hormone balance, immune function and gut health, while sharply reducing exposures to saturated fat, AGEs, endocrine-disrupting chemicals and inflammatory compounds common in animal-based and processed foods.

---

#### Weight & Metabolic Health

**What to do**

* Use WFPB eating to **lose excess weight without strict calorie counting**, focusing on whole, fibre-rich, low energy-density foods. 
* Replace foods high in saturated fat (meats, full-fat dairy, many processed snacks) with **carbohydrate-rich wholefoods** (potatoes, whole grains, beans, fruit) and modest amounts of whole-food fats.
* Consider **time-restricted eating or other fasting patterns** only if medically appropriate and especially carefully if you use diabetes medications.

**How to do it**

* Build meals around:

  * **High-fibre foods** (wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, fruit) to improve fullness and glycaemic control.
  * **Limited added fats**; rely mostly on whole food fat sources like nuts, seeds and avocado in sensible portions.
* Avoid “low-carb but high-fat” patterns that swap carbs for cheese, processed meat and oils, as these may worsen insulin resistance and vascular risk despite short-term weight changes.
* If you try **fasting or time-restricted eating**, combine it with WFPB food quality, and monitor blood sugars and blood pressure if you use medication; discuss with your clinician before significant changes.

**Why it matters**

* Excess fat stored in muscle and liver cells interferes with insulin signalling; replacing saturated fat-rich foods with high-fibre carbohydrates helps **“clear the fat” from cells, restore insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar**. 
* WFPB patterns are associated with **better metabolic markers** (blood sugar, blood pressure, lipids, waist circumference) and reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

---

#### Heart & Blood Vessel Health

**What to do**

* Eat a **low-saturated-fat, high-fibre WFPB diet** to lower total and LDL cholesterol, blood pressure and inflammation.
* Prioritise foods rich in **potassium, antioxidants, nitrates and whole-food omega-3s**, such as leafy greens, berries, beans, flax, chia and walnuts.
* Avoid or minimise **processed meats, red meats, high-fat dairy and ultra-processed snacks**, which are repeatedly linked to higher heart disease risk.

**How to do it**

* Build heart-protective meals around:

  * Leafy and cruciferous vegetables, beetroot and other nitrate-rich plants.
  * Beans, lentils and chickpeas daily.
  * Wholegrains (oats, barley, brown rice, whole wheat).
  * Flax, chia and walnuts for omega-3 fats.
* Use added oils sparingly; rely more on whole-food fats and, if using oils, small amounts of higher-unsaturated varieties (e.g. olive), keeping total added fat modest.

**Why it matters**

* WFPB diets improve endothelial function, decrease LDL, lower blood pressure and can impact atherosclerotic plaque progression, reducing risk of heart attacks and strokes.

---

#### Gut & Microbiome Health

**What to do**

* **Maximise plant diversity**: aim for many different plant foods across the week to encourage a diverse microbiome.
* Focus on **high-fibre foods**: vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, nuts and seeds.
* Limit **ultra-processed foods, artificial sweeteners and excess alcohol**, which can impair the microbiome and gut barrier.

**How to do it**

* Regularly include **prebiotic foods** such as onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, oats, beans, lentils and bananas to feed beneficial microbes. 
* Use **probiotics** thoughtfully:

  * Consider short-term probiotics after antibiotics or for specific conditions, in consultation with a clinician.
  * Do not rely on them as a substitute for an overall WFPB diet.
* Be cautious with **unnecessary antibiotics or long-term acid-suppressing drugs**, as both can alter the microbiome and GI environment; use only when medically indicated.

**Why it matters**

* A healthy microbiome helps produce **SCFAs** that nourish colon cells, reduce inflammation, support blood sugar control and lower colon cancer risk. A disrupted microbiome is linked to inflammatory bowel disease, IBS, obesity, metabolic disease and immune dysregulation.

---

#### Hormones, Fertility & Reproductive Health

**What to do**

* Use a **high-fibre WFPB diet** to help regulate oestrogen, insulin and other hormones relevant to conditions like period pain, PCOS and endometriosis.
* Reduce **red and processed meat, chicken and high-fat dairy**, which are associated with higher risk of some hormone-related conditions and provide AGEs and endocrine-disrupting exposures.
* Include **soy foods** (tofu, tempeh, edamame) as beneficial plant proteins, particularly in PCOS.

**How to do it**

* For **period pain and menstrual symptoms**, focus on:

  * High-fibre plants throughout the month.
  * Regular turmeric and ginger around and during your period.
  * Vitamin D sufficiency, via safe sun exposure and/or supplements if levels are low.
* For **PCOS**:

  * Emphasise fibre-rich, low-GI foods (wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, fruit).
  * Reduce white flour, added sugars, sugar-sweetened drinks and fried/processed foods high in AGEs.
  * Consider including soy protein as part of total protein intake.
* Discuss **contraceptive pill use** with your doctor, weighing benefits for pain and contraception against risks like elevated blood pressure, clotting, migraines, nutrient depletion and individual mood/skin responses. 

**Why it matters**

* Hormones operate like an orchestra; food, sleep, stress, environmental exposures and body composition can create either harmony or “noise”. WFPB patterns help reduce insulin resistance and excess oestrogen exposure, and soy foods can improve metabolic and hormonal markers in PCOS.

---

#### Immune Support & Infection Resilience

**What to do**

* Eat an **antioxidant- and vitamin-rich WFPB diet** to support microbiome and immune function.
* Aim for **at least seven hours of sleep** per night. 
* Practise **nasal breathing**, keep moving, stay hydrated and manage stress.

**How to do it**

* Include foods rich in **vitamin C** (oranges, kiwis, peppers, cauliflower) and **zinc** (beans, chickpeas, lentils, tofu, walnuts, flax seeds, wholemeal bread).
* Maintain adequate **vitamin D**, via safe sun exposure or supplements where needed, especially in low-sun seasons.
* Add **immune-supportive herbs and spices** such as garlic, sage, cumin, oregano, thyme, cloves and turmeric to daily cooking. 
* Use **regular movement** (“lymphatic lunges” and other activity) to encourage lymph flow and immune cell circulation. 

**Why it matters**

* The gut microbiome, sleep, stress, and nutrient status all directly affect T-cells and other immune mechanisms; WFPB eating plus good sleep, stress management and movement strengthens the body’s frontline defences.

---

#### Mind, Stress & Behaviour Change

**What to do**

* Treat **well-being as more than food**: integrate love, stress reduction, gratitude, movement, sleep and purpose alongside WFPB eating. 
* Clarify **your “why”** for change to anchor long-term habits. 
* Recognise stress as an **immunosuppressive and health-compromising force** and actively cultivate coping strategies. 

**How to do it**

* Use simple practices such as:

  * Daily reflection on why health matters to you and those you love.
  * Building small, repeatable wins—like swapping one meal a day to WFPB—so your identity shifts toward being a “plant-powered” person.
  * Stress-management techniques (breathing, movement, sleep hygiene, social connection) that you can realistically maintain.

**Why it matters**

* Motivation alone fades; identity, emotional rewards and noticing health improvements make WFPB changes sustainable. Changing how you live each day builds cumulative resilience in both mind and body.

---

#### Movement, Sleep & Daily Rhythm

*(The book discusses these as part of improving metabolic and immune health rather than in standalone chapters.)*

**What to do**

* Move your body regularly—aim to avoid long periods of inactivity and include daily walking or other enjoyable activity.
* Aim for **≥7 hours of sleep** most nights. 
* Consider timing of eating (not constant grazing, possible fasting windows) if appropriate for your health status. 

**Why it matters**

* Movement, sleep and food together determine **metabolic health** (blood sugar, blood pressure, lipids, waist circumference) and influence insulin sensitivity, inflammation and immune function.

---

#### Practical Living: Shopping, Budget & Taste Bud Reset

**What to do**

* Use the **Plant Power Plate** as your daily visual guide.
* Shop with a simple strategy focusing on whole plant foods and reading labels.
* Embrace **budget-friendly staples**: fruit, vegetables, rice, beans and other legumes. 

**How to do it**

* **Smart supermarket choices**:

  * Prefer products with green/amber labels and avoid red-labelled items (high saturated fat and sugar).
  * Know that “reduced fat” is not the same as “low fat”; reduced-fat products may still be high in fat.
  * Look out for hidden sugars (sucrose, glucose, syrups, fructose, maltose, honey, etc.) high on the ingredient list.
  * If something is “fat-free”, check if sugar has replaced fat, and vice versa.
  * When choosing between similar products, pick the one with **more fibre**.
* If cooking feels overwhelming, start with **healthier plant-based ready meals** as a stepping stone; improvements can still be dramatic, and success with these may inspire you to cook simple WFPB recipes later.
* Understand the **“taste-bud hijack”** of highly processed foods and allow time for your taste buds to reset by eating more wholefoods; repeated exposure to bitter, cruciferous vegetables gradually makes them taste better. 

**Why it matters**

* Practical constraints (time, skill, budget) are not barriers to improved health: even small, realistic changes in what you buy and cook can significantly improve glycaemic control, weight and overall health.

---

#### Families & All Life Stages

**What to do**

* Recognise that a **well-planned WFPB diet is suitable for all ages**—pregnant women, infants, children, adults and older people. 
* For pregnancy, breastfeeding, childhood and later life, pay special attention to key nutrients and supplements.

**How to do it – Pregnancy**

* Do **not** “eat for two” in terms of calories; increase energy intake only slightly (e.g. ~200 extra calories in the last trimester), but **increase nutrient density**, especially protein and folate.
* Maximise WFPB foods rich in folate, iron, calcium and other micronutrients (fruits, vegetables, pulses, wholegrains).
* Take a **prenatal multivitamin** before conception and throughout pregnancy, ensuring it provides:

  * Folic acid ≥400 mcg/day
  * Adequate iron, vitamin D (~600 IU/day), choline (~450 mg/day), iodine (~220 mcg/day) and calcium (~1200 mg/day). 
* Inform your doctor when pregnant, discuss your medical history and seek advice tailored to your situation.

**How to do it – Babies & Breastfeeding**

* Where possible, **breastfeed exclusively for around six months**, then continue breastfeeding alongside solid foods for as long as works for you, with WHO supporting continuation up to two years and beyond. 
* Understand that breastmilk:

  * Provides targeted antibodies via feedback from receptors around the nipple.
  * Contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that feed the baby’s gut microbes.
* Babies up to one year who are being breastfed should receive **vitamin D drops** (8.5–10 mcg/day), according to guidance cited in the book. 
* If breastfeeding is not possible, **formula feeding is acceptable**; soy-based formulas have been shown to support normal growth, bone, metabolic, reproductive, immune and neurological outcomes, but discuss exclusive soy formula use with a dietitian and never use homemade baby formula. 

**How to do it – Children & Older Adults**

* For children (“phyto-rich kids”), emphasise WFPB patterns to help address high rates of childhood overweight and obesity; focus on building a healthy food environment rather than strict dieting.
* For older adults, WFPB diets can still markedly improve blood pressure and other risk factors, even when changes start in later life. 

**Why it matters**

* Pregnancy and early life are windows where nutrition has **lifelong effects** on brain and body development; WFPB diets can reduce risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and preterm birth when well planned.
* Across life stages, WFPB diets help control weight, blood pressure and chronic disease risk, emphasising that **it is never too late or too early** to benefit from plant-powered choices.

### Protocols & Checklists

#### 1. Daily Plant Power Plate Checklist

Use this as a quick daily audit:

1. **Vegetables & Fruit**

   * Half of your plate from vegetables and/or fruit at most meals.
   * Include at least one **cruciferous** vegetable (e.g. broccoli, kale, cabbage) most days.
2. **Wholegrains & Starches**

   * A quarter plate from starchy vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash) and/or wholegrains (oats, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, brown rice, whole wheat). 
3. **Plant Protein**

   * A quarter plate from beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas, tofu, tempeh, edamame, nuts and seeds. 
4. **Healthy Fats**

   * Prefer whole-food fats (nuts, seeds, avocado) over oils; keep added oils minimal.
5. **Hydration**

   * Mostly water; add unsweetened plant-based milk when desired. 

---

#### 2. Supermarket Shopping Protocol

1. **Before you go**

   * Plan meals loosely around the Plant Power Plate.
   * Make a list: vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs/spices.
2. **In the store**

   * Choose items with **green or amber** labels and avoid red labels (high in saturated fat or sugar). 
   * Compare similar products:

     * Prefer **higher fibre**.
     * Watch for **hidden sugars** under different names high on the ingredients list.
   * Be wary of “reduced-fat” vs “low-fat” claims; “reduced-fat” can still be high in fat. 
3. **Home evaluation**

   * Notice which WFPB products you enjoy and note them, so future shops are quicker and more automatic.

---

#### 3. Diabetes & Insulin-Sensitivity Routine (for people with Type 2 diabetes, under medical supervision)

1. **Food Shift**

   * Replace high-saturated-fat foods with **carb-rich whole plant foods** (potatoes, beans, wholegrains, fruit). 
   * Reduce or eliminate processed meats, cheese, cream, butter and fried foods.
2. **Monitoring**

   * Check blood glucose regularly when changing your diet.
   * Expect medication needs (especially insulin) to **drop quickly**, sometimes within days; coordinate medication adjustment with your doctor to avoid hypoglycaemia.
3. **Non-food Levers**

   * Add daily movement (walking, activity).
   * Prioritise sleep (≥7 hours).
   * Implement basic stress-management strategies.

---

#### 4. Immune Support Checklist

* WFPB meals rich in **colourful fruits and vegetables** every day.
* **Vitamin C foods** (citrus, kiwi, peppers, cruciferous veg) daily. 
* **Zinc sources** (beans, chickpeas, lentils, tofu, walnuts, flax, wholemeal bread) most days. 
* **Vitamin D** adequacy via sun and/or supplements.
* **Sleep**: at least seven hours. 
* **Movement**: some daily activity to support lymph flow (“lymphatic lunges”). 
* **Herbs & spices**: garlic, sage, cumin, oregano, thyme, cloves, turmeric in cooking. 
* **Stress check-in**: one small step daily to reduce or manage stress. 

---

#### 5. Pregnancy Nutrient Protocol (with medical supervision)

1. **Before and during pregnancy**

   * Begin a **prenatal multivitamin** when trying to conceive and continue through pregnancy. 
2. **Daily targets (from book’s guidance)**

   * Folic acid: ≥400 mcg/day (diet + supplement).
   * Iron: supplement as needed to prevent/treat anaemia.
   * Vitamin D: ~600 IU/day.
   * Choline: ~450 mg/day.
   * Iodine: ~220 mcg/day.
   * Calcium: ~1200 mg/day. 
3. **Food focus**

   * Prioritise WFPB foods rich in folate, iron, calcium and protein (pulses, wholegrains, leafy greens, nuts and seeds).
   * Adjust textures (soups, stews, cold smoothies) if morning sickness makes raw veg difficult.

### Frameworks & Models

#### The Plant Power Plate

A visual framework for everyday meals:

| Plate Area            | What It Includes                                                   | Role                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| ½ plate veg + fruit   | Mixed vegetables (esp. crucifers) and fruit of many colours        | Fibre, micronutrients, antioxidants           |
| ¼ plate plant protein | Beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas, tofu, tempeh, edamame, nuts       | Protein, minerals, satiety                    |
| ¼ plate wholegrains   | Oats, brown rice, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, whole wheat, starches | Energy, fibre, “second meal” effect           |
| Side drink            | Mostly water; occasionally plant-based milk                        | Hydration, calcium, vitamin-fortified support |

---

#### Metabolic Health Snapshot

The book describes **metabolic health** using these markers:

* Blood sugar control (fasting glucose, HbA1c)
* Blood pressure
* Blood lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides)
* Waist circumference

Food quality (WFPB pattern), movement, sleep and stress together move these markers toward or away from health.

---

#### Hormone “Orchestra” Model

Hormones are likened to an orchestra: glands (ovaries, testes, thyroid, adrenals) and brain (hypothalamus, pituitary) must coordinate in time and tune. Diet, environmental exposures, stress, sleep and movement can disrupt or harmonise this orchestra, leading to wide-ranging effects on puberty timing, fertility, metabolism and risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. 

---

#### Wholefoods Plant-Based Lifestyle Lens

Across all chapters, the lifestyle is presented as a **multi-pillar model**:

* Food: WFPB pattern
* Movement: regular, enjoyable physical activity
* Sleep: adequate, consistent sleep
* Stress: reduction and coping strategies
* Purpose & connection: meaning, love, gratitude

All five pillars jointly support long-term health, not just weight or lab numbers.

---

### Guardrails & Caveats

* **Medical supervision for chronic disease.**
  If you have diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, pregnancy complications or take medications (especially insulin, blood pressure medications or thyroid medication), you must work with your doctor when making significant dietary or fasting changes. WFPB shifts can quickly improve insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, making medication adjustments necessary to avoid hypos or hypotension.

* **Vitamin B12 is non-negotiable.**
  Everyone following a WFPB diet should take reliable B12 in supplement form; deficiency risk is higher with age, acid-suppressing drugs and certain diabetes medications.

* **Vitamin D often requires supplementation.**
  Particularly in low-sun climates, older adults, those with darker skin or people who cover much of their skin may need vitamin D supplements; safe dosing and upper limits (e.g. 4000 IU/day as an upper safe level) are discussed in the book and should be respected.

* **Pregnancy and infancy require special care.**
  Although WFPB pregnancy is safe and advantageous, calorie needs rise only modestly while nutrient requirements (folate, iron, iodine, choline, calcium, protein) rise substantially. Prenatal vitamins and paediatric guidance on breastfeeding, vitamin D drops and formula choice are crucial.

* **Soy formula considerations.**
  Soy-based infant formulas are generally safe but should be chosen with clinician input if used exclusively before six months; **homemade formulas are never safe** for infants and should only be considered as drinks after one year. 

* **Not all plant-based products are health-promoting.**
  Highly processed vegan foods (desserts, high-fat meat substitutes, sugary drinks, refined snacks) can undermine the benefits of a WFPB pattern, especially during pregnancy or when managing chronic disease.

* **Probiotics are not a cure-all.**
  They may be helpful in specific contexts (e.g. post-antibiotics) but do not replace the need for a high-fibre WFPB diet and can be unnecessary or even unhelpful when used indiscriminately.

* **One size does not fit all for hormonal contraception.**
  The pill can reduce period pain and cancer risks but may raise blood pressure, clotting risk and affect mood, migraines and nutrient status; personalised discussion with a clinician is essential.

### Key Terms & Concepts

* **WFPB (Wholefoods Plant-Based) Diet**
  A dietary pattern focusing on minimally processed plant foods (vegetables, fruits, wholegrains, legumes, nuts, seeds) and minimising or avoiding animal products and highly processed foods.

* **Microbiome**
  The community of trillions of microbes in the gut that interact with diet, immunity and metabolism; supported by high-fibre, diverse plant foods and harmed by ultra-processed foods, excess animal products and some medications. 

* **SCFAs (Short-Chain Fatty Acids)**
  Beneficial fats (like acetate, propionate, butyrate) produced when gut bacteria ferment fibre; they nourish colon cells, reduce inflammation and support metabolic health.

* **Insulin Resistance**
  A state where cells become less responsive to insulin, often due to fat accumulation inside muscle and liver cells; leads to higher blood sugar and Type 2 diabetes. Improved by lowering saturated fat and increasing fibre-rich carbohydrates.

* **Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)**
  Compounds formed when proteins or fats combine with sugars, particularly abundant in meat, cheese, fried eggs, butter, cream and fried/processed foods; associated with ageing, oxidative stress and PCOS; higher with high-heat cooking like barbecuing. 

* **Phyto-oestrogens / Isoflavones**
  Plant compounds, especially in soy, that can bind to oestrogen receptors and exert beneficial modulatory effects on hormones and hormone-sensitive conditions.

* **Prebiotics**
  Fibres and related compounds in plant foods that feed beneficial gut bacteria, promoting SCFA production and microbiome health.

* **Probiotics**
  Live microorganisms in supplements or fermented foods that may confer health benefits in specific situations; useful adjuncts but not substitutes for a WFPB diet.

* **Plant Power Plate**
  The book’s core meal model: half vegetables/fruit, a quarter plant protein, a quarter wholegrains/starches, plus water/plant milk, to minimise nutrient counting and maximise variety.

This handbook captures the book’s core, practical guidance so you can use WFPB nutrition and lifestyle changes to improve your health, while respecting the key safeguards and nuances highlighted by Dr Newman.
