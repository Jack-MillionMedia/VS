### Core Principles

* **Holistic, person-centred care**

  * Health is seen as balance and “homeostasis” in body and mind, not just absence of disease. 
  * Herbal treatment aims to support the body’s innate self-regulation while addressing underlying causes such as diet, lifestyle, stress and environment, not just symptoms. 

* **Herbs plus diet and lifestyle, not herbs alone**

  * Herbs are most effective when combined with appropriate food, adequate rest, movement, emotional support and a healthier way of life.
  * Digestion, elimination and nervous system balance are repeatedly treated as central to almost every chronic complaint.

* **Global herbal traditions and the five elements**

  * Many healing systems (Greek humoral, Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan medicine, Unani Tibb) share the idea that humans and plants are formed of five elements/qualities, and that health depends on keeping them in dynamic balance. 
  * These systems classify herbs by qualities such as hot/cold, moist/dry, tastes and their effects on organs and subtle energies, guiding selection and combination of remedies. 

* **Whole-plant synergy and medicinal actions**

  * Herbs contain many constituents (e.g. mucilage, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, gums, fructans) that act together; the whole plant is often gentler and more balancing than isolated chemicals.
  * Herbs are understood functionally by “medicinal actions” such as alterative, bitter, astringent, carminative, antimicrobial, nervine, adaptogen, cardio-tonic and many others.

* **Case history and individualisation**

  * A full consultation gathers detailed history of symptoms, constitution, diet, lifestyle, emotions, medications and environment, plus physical examination where appropriate. 
  * Prescriptions are tailored herb blends and self-care plans that fit the person’s patterns (e.g. hot/cold, damp/dry, tense/relaxed), not just their disease label.

* **Self-care plus professional support**

  * Simple minor complaints can often be safely treated at home with kitchen herbs and over-the-counter preparations.
  * The book explicitly states it does *not* replace medical care and that many situations require a qualified herbalist or mainstream practitioner.

* **Respect for plants and sustainability**

  * Herbs are part of a living ecosystem; growing and harvesting them mindfully, without over-picking or damaging habitats, is an ethical and practical necessity.
  * Quality (freshness, correct species, clean environment, proper drying and storage) strongly affects safety and efficacy.

### Practical Playbook

#### Foundations: Using Herbs Wisely

**What to do**

* Use herbs to *support* overall balance: digestion, elimination, stress response, sleep, circulation and immunity.
* Start with a small home repertoire of safe, common herbs for minor issues (e.g. chamomile, peppermint, ginger, yarrow, garlic).
* Keep a symptom and lifestyle diary to observe patterns and effects of remedies. 

**How to do it**

* Match herbs to *patterns*, not only diagnoses: e.g. hot, inflamed conditions get cooling, soothing herbs; cold, sluggish states get warming, stimulating herbs.
* Combine herbs with dietary adjustments (e.g. whole foods, less sugar and refined carbohydrates, adequate fibre, fermented foods) and lifestyle measures (exercise, relaxation, better sleep routines).
* Review any chronic or serious condition with a professional herbalist or doctor, especially when taking pharmaceuticals.

**Why it matters**

* Herbs work best in the context of a healthier way of living and can then reduce the need for stronger interventions, while still respecting the limits of self-care. 

---

#### Digestion & Gut Health

**What to do**

* Prioritise digestion in almost all chronic complaints: improve diet, digestive secretions, gut motility and microbiota.
* Use **bitters** (e.g. dandelion, gentian, globe artichoke, yarrow) to stimulate appetite, stomach acid, bile and liver function, especially in sluggish, heavy or congestive states.
* Use **carminatives** and **aromatics** (e.g. chamomile, fennel, dill, peppermint, ginger, meadowsweet) to relieve gas, cramping and indigestion.
* Use **demulcents/mucilaginous herbs** (e.g. slippery elm, marshmallow, plantain, psyllium) to soothe irritated mucosa, modulate peristalsis and normalise stool consistency. 
* Use **alteratives and hepatic herbs** (e.g. burdock, dandelion, milk thistle, holy thistle) to support liver detoxification and hormone metabolism.
* Include antimicrobial herbs and spices (e.g. garlic, golden seal, cat’s claw, calendula, myrrh, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger) in cases of dysbiosis or infection-linked gut issues.

**How to do it**

* For **constipation**: increase fibre and fluids; use bulk-forming mucilaginous seeds (e.g. psyllium), bitters and mild laxatives; reserve strong anthraquinone laxatives (e.g. senna, cascara) for short-term use under guidance.
* For **diarrhoea**: lean on astringent herbs (e.g. agrimony, raspberry leaf, meadowsweet, yarrow, beth root) plus demulcents to protect the gut, while addressing infection and diet.
* For **IBS**: combine antispasmodics (e.g. chamomile, cramp bark, wild yam), carminatives, demulcents and nervines, alongside stress management, probiotic foods and avoidance of processed, irritant foods.
* Use fermented foods (e.g. kefir, miso, sauerkraut, live yoghurt) or probiotic supplements (e.g. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria) to restore healthy flora, especially after antibiotics or dysbiosis. 

**Why it matters**

* A healthy gut improves nutrient absorption, modulates inflammation, influences mood and resilience to stress, and underpins the effectiveness of herbal treatment for many systems.

---

#### Nervous System, Mood & Stress

**What to do**

* Address nervous system issues through both **nervines** (calming or strengthening herbs) and **adaptogens** (stress-buffering tonics), plus diet and gut health. 
* For **acute tension and anxiety**, use calming nervines such as passion flower, California poppy, wild lettuce, skullcap and wild oats. 
* For **chronic stress and burnout**, use adaptogens such as ginseng, ashwagandha, bacopa, gotu kola, he shou wu, schizandra, shatavari, bhringaraj, liquorice and holy basil. 
* Use herbs that enhance GABA (e.g. valerian, lemon balm, skullcap, baikal skullcap, ashwagandha, lavender, chamomile) to improve calm and sleep. 

**How to do it**

* Reduce or avoid caffeine, alcohol, refined sugar and “junk food,” which deplete nutrients and aggravate anxiety and insomnia. 
* Ensure adequate intake of B-vitamins, vitamin C and E, calcium, magnesium, zinc and essential fatty acids, which support the nervous system, especially in stress. 
* Combine nervines and adaptogens with regular movement, breathing exercises and relaxation practices to retrain the stress response. (The book repeatedly pairs herbal support with lifestyle measures for stress and resilience.)

**Why it matters**

* Many nervines are also digestives and antimicrobials, so they act at multiple levels (gut, brain, immunity), making them powerful tools to transform mental and emotional states when combined with lifestyle change. 

---

#### Immunity & Infections

**What to do**

* For acute infections (e.g. colds, flu, sore throats, ear and sinus infections), use a mix of **antimicrobials**, **immune enhancers** and **diaphoretics/decongestants**, plus rest and fluids.
* Use herbs such as garlic, cat’s claw, golden seal, myrrh, olive leaf, andrographis, elecampane, calendula, echinacea, thyme, yarrow and elderflowers as indicated for specific infections.
* Support elimination via bowels, kidneys, skin and lungs to help the body clear toxins and debris during and after infection.

**How to do it**

* Use **hot infusions** of diaphoretic herbs (e.g. yarrow, elderflower, lime blossom) taken frequently for fevers and chills, to promote sweating and relieve congestion.
* For upper respiratory infections, combine anticatarrhal herbs (e.g. elder, plantain, mullein, thyme, hyssop) with expectorants and soothing demulcents to loosen and clear mucus.
* After recurrent or chronic infections, use immune tonics and adaptogens (e.g. astragalus, reishi, ashwagandha, schizandra, Siberian ginseng) to rebuild resilience.

**Why it matters**

* Strategic use of herbs in early stages of infection can shorten duration, reduce complications and support long-term immune balance, especially when combined with rest and good nutrition.

---

#### Hormones, Menstruation & Menopause

**What to do**

* Use **uterine antispasmodics/tonics** (e.g. cramp bark, black haw, wild yam) for painful periods, cramps, threatened miscarriage and uterine irritability, while seeking medical advice for serious conditions.
* Use **hormone-balancing herbs** (e.g. vitex, shatavari, Chinese angelica, ashwagandha, black cohosh, liquorice, wild yam, paeony) for endometriosis, PMS and menstrual irregularities, alongside liver-supporting herbs.
* For **heavy or peri-menopausal bleeding**, employ astringent uterine tonics (e.g. beth root, yarrow, periwinkle, lady’s mantle, agrimony, bayberry, rose), while investigating underlying causes medically.
* For **menopausal symptoms** (hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, insomnia), use phyto-oestrogenic and adrenal-supportive herbs (e.g. shatavari, red clover, Chinese angelica, wild yam, wild indigo, Siberian ginseng, black cohosh, liquorice).

**How to do it**

* Combine hormone-modulating herbs with liver tonics (e.g. burdock, dandelion, milk thistle, holy thistle) to aid metabolism and excretion of excess hormones.
* Avoid caffeine, alcohol, refined foods and environmental xeno-oestrogens as far as possible; prioritise regular exercise and nutrient-dense food.
* For low libido and impotence, use adaptogenic aphrodisiac tonics (e.g. ashwagandha, gokshura, shatavari, astragalus, Chinese angelica, schizandra, liquorice, ginsengs) and relaxing nervines (e.g. oats, rose, rosemary, skullcap, gotu kola).

**Why it matters**

* Many gynaecological and menopausal problems reflect combined hormonal, stress, circulatory and inflammatory imbalances; multi-system herbal strategies plus lifestyle change can reduce symptoms and improve long-term bone and cardiovascular health.

---

#### Skin, Detoxification & Elimination

**What to do**

* Use **alteratives/“blood cleansers”** (e.g. burdock, nettles, red clover, sarsaparilla, Oregon grape, dandelion, uva ursi) for chronic skin issues, arthritic conditions and toxin overload patterns.
* Combine alteratives with liver and kidney tonics to improve breakdown and excretion of metabolic and hormonal waste.
* Use appropriate topical applications (e.g. washes, creams, compresses, poultices) with herbs such as marigold, chamomile, yarrow, lime blossom and beth root to reduce inflammation, soothe and promote healing.

**How to do it**

* For conditions like eczema or acne, address digestion and allergies, reduce processed and sugary foods, support liver and kidneys, and use soothing, anti-inflammatory and astringent herbs internally and externally.
* Use baths, foot baths, compresses, poultices and washes as described in the pharmacy section to deliver herbs directly to the skin and underlying tissues.

**Why it matters**

* Skin often mirrors internal imbalances in digestion, hormones and elimination; treating both inside and out leads to deeper, more lasting improvements than topical treatment alone.

---

#### Circulation & Heart Health

**What to do**

* Use **cardiotonic and vasodilatory herbs** such as hawthorn, motherwort, astragalus and lime blossom to support circulation, blood pressure and heart function, especially where there is mild hypertension, palpitations or stress-linked cardiovascular tension.
* Combine circulation herbs with lifestyle changes: exercise, stress reduction, stopping smoking, and whole-food diets low in refined fats and sugars. (The book repeatedly links circulatory issues with lifestyle in individual monographs and protocols.)

**How to do it**

* Lime flower, as an example, is used to lower blood pressure, reduce arterial spasm and protect blood vessels while also calming anxiety and aiding sleep.
* Dose and herb choice in established heart disease or when on cardiac drugs must be overseen by an experienced practitioner, particularly for herbs with strong cardiac actions.

**Why it matters**

* Gentle, long-term use of vascular tonics and lifestyle shifts can support cardiovascular resilience and reduce risk factors, but they do not substitute for medical management of serious disease.

---

#### Children & Sensitive Groups

**What to do**

* Use milder herbs and lower doses for children, the elderly, pregnancy and those with chronic illness. 
* Prefer teas, syrups and glycerites over high-alcohol tinctures in children and when alcohol is inappropriate.

**How to do it**

* Calculate child doses using rules such as:

  * **Young’s rule**: (age ÷ (age + 12)) × adult dose
  * **Clark’s rule**: (weight in kg ÷ 70) × adult dose
  * **Fried’s rule** for infants based on months. 
* Always err on the lower side, especially at the start or when using herbs with stronger actions, and monitor closely. 

**Why it matters**

* Children and other sensitive people metabolise herbs differently and may be more affected by both beneficial and adverse effects, so cautious dosing and careful herb choice are essential.

---

#### Home Herbal Pharmacy

**What to do**

* Learn a small set of core preparations: **infusions**, **decoctions**, **tinctures**, **syrups**, **capsules/powders**, **creams/ointments**, **baths/compresses/poultices**.
* Match preparation to herb and condition:

  * Aerial parts and soft tissues → infusions.
  * Hard roots, barks, berries → decoctions.
  * Resinous or strongly active herbs → tinctures or fluid extracts.

**How to do it (core methods)**

* **Infusions (teas)**:

  * Typically 1–2 tsp dried herb per cup of boiling water; steep 5–15 minutes (longer for stronger effect or tougher material), covered to retain volatile oils. 
  * Drink 1–3 cups daily depending on condition and herb strength.
* **Decoctions**:

  * Simmer tougher material (roots, bark, berries) in water (often 10–20 minutes) to extract constituents. 
  * Strain and drink as with teas, or use as base for syrups and compresses.
* **Tinctures**:

  * Prepare by macerating herbs in alcohol/water mixtures for several weeks, then pressing and bottling.
  * Typical adult daily dose is in the range of drops to a few ml, divided across the day depending on herb and purpose.
* **Syrups**:

  * Combine strong infusions/decoctions with sugar or honey to preserve and improve taste, especially for children and cough remedies. 
* **Topicals** (creams, ointments, oils, baths, compresses, poultices):

  * Use for local issues such as sprains, bruises, eczema, wounds, neuralgia, headaches and muscular pain.

**Storage & shelf-life**

* Store herbs and preparations in cool, dark, dry conditions, in well-sealed containers.
* Dried herbs keep best for about a year; powders deteriorate faster unless encapsulated; tinctures and glycerites can keep up to 3 years if stored correctly.

---

#### Growing, Harvesting & Storing Herbs

**What to do**

* Grow herbs organically in suitable soil and aspect, minimising chemical inputs and protecting biodiversity.
* Harvest at the correct stage (e.g. leaves before flowering, flowers in full bloom, roots in their proper season) and avoid polluted areas (roadsides, sprayed fields).
* Dry herbs quickly but gently, away from direct sun, and store in airtight, labelled containers. 

**How to do it**

* Plan a small herb garden with culinary and medicinal staples that match your climate (e.g. mint, chamomile, thyme, calendula, yarrow, lemon balm).
* When harvesting, take only a portion of each plant (often no more than a third) so it can regrow and continue to support the ecosystem.

**Why it matters**

* Growing and preparing your own herbs improves quality control, deepens connection with remedies and supports ecological and personal resilience.

---

### Protocols & Checklists

#### General Self-Care Protocol for Minor Ailments

1. **Assess severity and red flags**

   * Check for high fever, severe pain, sudden weight loss, bleeding, persistent vomiting/diarrhoea, chest pain, breathing difficulties or other alarming signs.
   * If present, seek immediate medical help rather than self-treating.

2. **Address basics first**

   * Rest, warmth, appropriate fluids, light nourishing foods, reduced stimulants and irritants (caffeine, alcohol, sugar).

3. **Choose herbs by system and pattern**

   * Identify main system (digestive, respiratory, urinary, nervous, reproductive, skin, etc.) and pattern (hot, cold, damp, dry, tense, weak).
   * Select herbs with actions that balance the pattern (e.g. cooling demulcents for heat and irritation; warming carminatives for cold, stagnant digestion).

4. **Start with low to moderate doses**

   * Use teas, tinctures or syrups at recommended amounts; observe how you respond and adjust within safe ranges.

5. **Monitor progress and duration**

   * If symptoms worsen, change character, or persist beyond the timeframes indicated in the conditions section (typically days for acute issues), seek professional evaluation.

---

#### Digestive Protocols (Constipation, Diarrhoea, IBS)

**Constipation checklist**

* Increase:

  * Water intake.
  * Fibre from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, seeds.
  * Physical movement.
* Use herbs:

  * Bulk laxatives: psyllium seed, flaxseed (with plenty of water).
  * Demulcents: marshmallow, slippery elm, plantain.
  * Bitters: dandelion root, globe artichoke, gentian, yarrow.
* Avoid long-term reliance on strong anthraquinone laxatives (e.g. senna) without professional supervision.

**Diarrhoea checklist**

* Ensure hydration with water and mineral-rich fluids.
* Trigger investigation if there is blood, high fever, severe pain or prolonged symptoms.
* Use:

  * Astringents: agrimony, raspberry leaf, meadowsweet, yarrow, beth root.
  * Demulcents: slippery elm, marshmallow, plantain.
  * Antimicrobials if infection suspected: garlic, golden seal, myrrh, oregano (per book guidance).

**IBS protocol (pattern-based)**

* Remove/limit:

  * Highly processed foods, sugar, excessive alcohol and caffeine, known food triggers.
* Support:

  * Carminatives (peppermint, fennel, dill, chamomile).
  * Antispasmodics (cramp bark, wild yam, chamomile).
  * Demulcents (marshmallow, slippery elm).
  * Nervines and adaptogens for stress (e.g. ashwagandha, skullcap, wild oats).
  * Probiotic foods and, where indicated, probiotic supplements.

---

#### Mood, Anxiety & Sleep Routine

**Daily nervous system support**

1. Reduce stimulants (coffee, strong tea, energy drinks), sugar and alcohol.
2. Take a daily nervine tea (e.g. chamomile, lemon balm, lime flower, oats) or tincture blend.
3. Add adaptogens (e.g. ashwagandha, holy basil, ginseng) in the morning for energy and stress resilience, not late at night.
4. Use stronger sedative nervines (e.g. valerian, passion flower, hops, skullcap) in the evening for sleep if needed.

**Acute anxiety protocol**

* Take small, frequent doses of fast-acting calming herbs (e.g. passion flower, California poppy, wild lettuce, skullcap, wild oats) every hour or two until symptoms ease. 
* Practice slow breathing or resting with a warm herbal tea to reinforce calm.

---

#### Menstrual Pain & Menopause Snapshot Protocol

**Menstrual cramps and pelvic pain**

1. During acute pain, use uterine antispasmodics (cramp bark, black haw, wild yam, pasque flower, black cohosh) in short, “acute” doses.
2. For long-term regulation, combine hormone-balancing herbs (vitex, shatavari, Chinese angelica, ashwagandha, liquorice) with liver herbs (burdock, dandelion, milk thistle).
3. Use topical abdominal massage with appropriate essential oils (lavender, rosemary, rose, chamomile, ginger diluted in carrier oil) to ease pain.

**Menopause symptom routine**

1. Daily:

   * Phyto-oestrogenic herbs (red clover, shatavari, wild yam, Chinese angelica, black cohosh, liquorice).
   * Adrenal-supporting adaptogens (ashwagandha, Siberian ginseng).
2. As needed:

   * Relaxant nervines (chamomile, lemon balm, motherwort, pasque flower, wild oats) for anxiety and sleep issues.
3. Lifestyle:

   * Regular exercise, nutrient supplements (e.g. evening primrose oil, vitamin E, calcium, magnesium) and avoidance of caffeine, alcohol and junk food.

---

### Frameworks & Models

#### Global Elemental & Humoral Framework

* **Shared thesis**: Everything (including humans and herbs) is composed of energy and matter expressed as five elements; health depends on their balance.
* **Greek humours**: Blood, phlegm, yellow and black bile linked to hot/cold and moist/dry; herbs restore humoral balance. 
* **Ayurveda**:

  * Three **doshas** (vata, pitta, kapha) combine elements and govern constitution and disease patterns.
  * Herbs are classified by taste (rasa), post-digestive effect, energetics and effect on doshas and tissues.
* **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**:

  * Herbs classified by nature (hot, warm, neutral, cool, cold), taste, meridian tropism and toxicity.
  * Shen Nong’s classic divides herbs into superior, middle and lower categories by safety and primary use. 
* **Tibetan and Unani Tibb**:

  * Integrate elements, humours and organs; herbs selected to rebalance “wind,” “bile,” “phlegm,” temperament and organ systems. 

---

#### Chemistry of Herbs Model

Selected groups and their main wellness implications:

* **Mucilage**

  * Sugary, gel-like; coats and protects mucous membranes (digestive, respiratory, genito-urinary).
  * Soothes inflammation and irritation; can both ease diarrhoea (by calming irritation) and constipation (by bulking stool).
* **Gums**

  * Healing exudates that can have antimicrobial and liver-supporting actions (e.g. marigold, guggulu).
* **Fructans (e.g. inulin)**

  * Prebiotic fibres that regulate blood sugar and feed beneficial gut flora (e.g. elecampane, globe artichoke, goldenrod, burdock).
* **Alkaloids**

  * Nitrogen-containing, pharmacologically potent; many of the more toxic plants contain them (e.g. belladonna, opium poppy, caffeine).
  * Potent effects (stimulant, bronchodilator, antimicrobial, analgesic, narcotic); high-alkaloid herbs require strict caution and are often practitioner-only.
* **Tannins**

  * Astringent compounds that tighten tissues, reduce secretions and help in diarrhoea, bleeding and some skin conditions.
* **Flavonoids & phenolics**

  * Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, often cardioprotective and capillary-strengthening (e.g. lime flower, hawthorn, yarrow).

### Guardrails & Caveats

* **This book (and this playbook) does not replace medical care**

  * Herbal treatment of over 100 common ailments is described, but serious, persistent or unclear conditions need professional medical or herbal assessment.

* **Limitations of evidence and traditional concepts**

  * Some concepts such as “alteratives,” “cooling herbs to clear accumulated heat” and elemental language have limited modern scientific backing, though they are central to long-standing traditional systems.
  * Use them as heuristic frameworks rather than rigid scientific claims.

* **Herbs for practitioners only**

  * Herbs rich in potent alkaloids or cardiac glycosides, or those with narrow safety margins, are not included in the Materia Medica for lay use and should only be prescribed by qualified practitioners.

* **Interactions and contraindications**

  * Herbs can interact with drugs (e.g. beth root may reduce the effect of cardiac glycosides; wild carrot seed acts as a contraceptive and is contraindicated in pregnancy).
  * Always check for interactions and contraindications, especially with heart medications, anticoagulants, hormones, immunosuppressants and in pregnancy, breastfeeding or serious illness.

* **Pregnancy, breastfeeding and children**

  * Many herbs are contraindicated or must be used only under expert guidance (e.g. uterine stimulants, strong purgatives, some phyto-hormonal herbs).
  * Stick to well-established safe herbs at reduced doses, and seek professional input for anything beyond simple, familiar remedies. 

* **Dose matters**

  * Herbal preparations contain active pharmacological constituents; efficacy and safety depend on dose, frequency, duration and preparation.

* **Red-flag symptoms (sample)**

  * Sudden, severe or unexplained pain; high or persistent fever; rectal bleeding or black stools; unexplained weight loss; persistent vomiting or diarrhoea; chest pain; shortness of breath; neurological symptoms; suspected STIs; suspected cancer.
  * In these cases, herbs may play a supportive role *only after* proper diagnosis and in conjunction with medical care.

### Key Terms & Concepts

*(Short, practical glossary based on the book’s usage.)*

* **Alterative** – Herb that gradually improves blood and tissue health and supports elimination (e.g. burdock, nettles, red clover). 
* **Adaptogen** – Herb that increases resilience to stress, improves energy and helps normalise body functions (e.g. ashwagandha, ginseng, schizandra).
* **Nervine** – Herb that acts on the nervous system, calming, strengthening or restoring it (e.g. chamomile, skullcap, oats, passion flower).
* **Carminative** – Herb that relieves gas, bloating and cramping and aids digestion (e.g. fennel, peppermint, chamomile, dill).
* **Demulcent** – Mucilage-rich herb that soothes and protects mucous membranes (e.g. marshmallow, slippery elm, plantain, psyllium). 
* **Astringent** – Herb that tightens tissues and reduces secretions and bleeding (e.g. beth root, agrimony, raspberry leaf, yarrow, witch hazel).
* **Bitter** – Herb with a bitter taste that stimulates digestive secretions, appetite and liver/bile flow (e.g. dandelion, gentian, globe artichoke, yarrow).
* **Diaphoretic** – Herb that promotes sweating and can help break fevers and clear toxins via the skin (e.g. yarrow, elderflower, lime blossom).
* **Cardiotonic** – Herb that supports heart and circulation without being a strong cardiac drug in lay practice (e.g. hawthorn, motherwort, lime blossom, astragalus).
* **Dosha (Ayurveda)** – Functional energy type (vata, pitta, kapha) describing constitutional patterns and disease tendencies; herbs and lifestyle are used to rebalance doshas.
* **Qi (TCM)** – Vital energy that flows through channels; herbs influence qi, blood, fluids and organ systems according to their nature, taste and meridian tropism. 
* **Mucilage** – Gel-like plant carbohydrate that draws water, forming a soothing coating on mucous membranes and modulating bowel function. 
* **Tannins** – Astringent polyphenols that contract tissues, reduce secretions and protect mucous membranes.
* **Phyto-oestrogens** – Plant compounds (e.g. isoflavones) structurally similar to oestrogen that can modulate hormonal activity, especially in menopause (e.g. shatavari, red clover, Chinese angelica, wild yam, black cohosh).
