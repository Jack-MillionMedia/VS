# Anatomy Reference: Body Systems

## 9. The Digestive System

### Overview

The digestive system breaks down food into absorbable nutrients, absorbs these nutrients into the bloodstream, and eliminates undigested waste. It consists of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (alimentary canal) and accessory digestive organs.

### Primary Functions

- **Ingestion:** Taking food into mouth
- **Mechanical Digestion:** Physical breakdown (chewing, churning)
- **Chemical Digestion:** Enzymatic breakdown of macromolecules
- **Propulsion:** Movement of food through GI tract (peristalsis, segmentation)
- **Absorption:** Movement of nutrients from GI tract into blood/lymph
- **Defecation:** Elimination of indigestible waste (feces)

### GI Tract Organization

Continuous muscular tube (~9 meters/30 feet long) extending from mouth to anus

**Organs (in sequence):**
1. Mouth (oral cavity)
2. Pharynx
3. Esophagus
4. Stomach
5. Small intestine
6. Large intestine
7. Rectum and anal canal

**Accessory Organs:**
- Teeth and tongue
- Salivary glands
- Liver
- Gallbladder
- Pancreas

### Basic GI Tract Structure

Four-layered tube (from lumen outward)

#### Mucosa (Innermost Layer)

**Three Sublayers:**

1. **Epithelium:**
   - Lines lumen
   - Type varies by region and function
   - **Mouth, esophagus, anus:** Stratified squamous (protection from abrasion)
   - **Stomach, intestines:** Simple columnar (secretion and absorption)

2. **Lamina Propria:**
   - Loose connective tissue
   - Contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, lymphoid tissue (GALT)
   - Supports epithelium

3. **Muscularis Mucosae:**
   - Thin layer of smooth muscle
   - Creates folds to increase surface area
   - Aids in secretion and absorption

#### Submucosa

- Dense connective tissue
- Contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, submucosal (Meissner's) plexus (nerves)
- **Submucosal Glands:** Present in esophagus and duodenum

#### Muscularis Externa

**Two Layers of Smooth Muscle:**

1. **Inner Circular Layer:** Contraction narrows lumen
2. **Outer Longitudinal Layer:** Contraction shortens tube

**Myenteric (Auerbach's) Plexus:**
- Nerve network between muscle layers
- Controls GI motility

**Exception:**
- Stomach has third oblique layer (innermost)
- Mouth, pharynx, upper esophagus, external anal sphincter have skeletal muscle

#### Serosa or Adventitia (Outermost Layer)

**Serosa (Visceral Peritoneum):**
- Serous membrane
- Most of GI tract within peritoneal cavity

**Adventitia:**
- Fibrous connective tissue
- Organs outside peritoneal cavity (parts of esophagus, rectum)

### Enteric Nervous System

"Brain of the gut" - intrinsic nervous system

**Components:**
- Submucosal plexus
- Myenteric plexus
- ~100 million neurons (more than spinal cord)

**Functions:**

- Regulates secretions
- Can function independently but modulated by ANS

**ANS Influence:**
- **Parasympathetic (Vagus Nerve):** "Rest and digest"
  - Increases motility, secretions
  - Relaxes sphincters
- **Sympathetic:** "Fight or flight"
  - Decreases motility, secretions
  - Contracts sphincters

### Peritoneum

Serous membrane lining abdominal cavity and covering organs

**Layers:**
- **Parietal Peritoneum:** Lines abdominal wall
- **Visceral Peritoneum (Serosa):** Covers organs

**Peritoneal Cavity:**
- Potential space between layers
- Contains serous fluid (lubricates, reduces friction)

**Mesenteries:**
- Double layer of peritoneum
- Connect organs to body wall
- Provide pathway for blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves
- Store fat
- **Greater Omentum:** "Fatty apron"; hangs from stomach, drapes over intestines
- **Lesser Omentum:** Connects stomach and liver
- **Mesentery Proper:** Fans out from small intestine

**Peritoneal vs. Retroperitoneal:**
- **Intraperitoneal:** Within peritoneal cavity (stomach, jejunum, ileum, cecum, transverse/sigmoid colon)
- **Retroperitoneal:** Behind peritoneum (pancreas, duodenum, ascending/descending colon, rectum)

### Upper GI Tract

- Mucus lubricates passage
- No digestion

**Swallowing (Deglutition):**

Three phases

1. **Voluntary (Buccal) Phase:**
   - Tongue pushes bolus into oropharynx

2. **Pharyngeal Phase (Involuntary):**
   - Soft palate rises (closes nasopharynx)
   - Larynx elevates; epiglottis covers glottis (prevents aspiration)
   - Upper esophageal sphincter relaxes
   - Bolus passes into esophagus
   - Breathing temporarily inhibited

3. **Esophageal Phase (Involuntary):**

   - Vagus nerve stimulates secretions
   - Accounts for ~30% of secretion

2. **Gastric Phase:**
   - Food in stomach
   - Triggered by distension and chemical stimuli (peptides)
   - **Gastrin Release:** Stimulates HCl and pepsinogen secretion
   - Accounts for ~60% of secretion

3. **Intestinal Phase:**
   - Food enters small intestine
   - Initially stimulates gastric secretion (brief)
   - Then **inhibits** via hormones (secretin, CCK) and neural reflexes
   - Slows gastric emptying (allows time for intestinal digestion)

**Stomach Motility:**

**Mixing Waves:**

#### Renal Tubule

Processes filtrate

**Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):**
- Longest, most convoluted segment
- **Epithelium:** Simple cuboidal with microvilli (brush border)
- **Functions:**

### Urine Formation

Three processes

#### Glomerular Filtration

Passive process; forces plasma through filtration membrane

**Driving Force:** Glomerular blood pressure

**Pressures Involved:**

**Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure (GHP):** ~55 mmHg
- Blood pressure in glomerulus (pushing fluid out)

**Opposing Pressures:**
- **Capsular Hydrostatic Pressure (CHP):** ~15 mmHg (fluid in capsular space)
- **Blood Colloid Osmotic Pressure (BCOP):** ~30 mmHg (proteins in blood pull water back)

**Net Filtration Pressure (NFP):**
- NFP = GHP - (CHP + BCOP)
- NFP = 55 - (15 + 30) = 10 mmHg
- Net outward pressure drives filtration

**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):**
- Volume of filtrate formed per minute
- Normal: ~125 mL/min (180 L/day)
- 99% reabsorbed → ~1.5 L urine/day

**Factors Affecting GFR:**

**Intrinsic Controls (Renal Autoregulation):**
- Maintain constant GFR despite BP fluctuations (80-180 mmHg)
- **Myogenic Mechanism:** Smooth muscle in afferent arteriole responds to stretch
- **Tubuloglomerular Feedback:** Macula densa senses filtrate flow/composition

**Extrinsic Controls (Neural and Hormonal):**
- **Sympathetic Nervous System:** Constricts afferent arterioles (decreases GFR during stress)
- **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):** See below

#### Tubular Reabsorption

Movement of substances from filtrate back into blood

**Occurs along entire tubule; majority in PCT**

**Substances Reabsorbed:**
- **100% (normally):** Glucose, amino acids
- **99%:** Water (65% PCT, 15% descending limb, 19% collecting duct - regulated)
- **Variable amounts:** Ions (Na+, K+, Ca²+, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻), urea

**Mechanisms:**

**Active Transport:**
- Requires energy (ATP)
- Against concentration gradient
- **Primary:** Na+/K+-ATPase pumps
- **Secondary:** Glucose, amino acids (co-transported with Na+)

**Passive Transport:**
- No energy required
- Down concentration gradient
- **Diffusion:** Urea, lipid-soluble substances
- **Osmosis:** Water (follows solutes)

**Water Reabsorption:**

**Obligatory (Unregulated):**
- PCT and descending limb of loop
- Water follows solute reabsorption (osmosis)

**Facultative (Regulated):**
- Collecting duct
- Controlled by **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone)**
  - High ADH: More water reabsorbed, concentrated urine
  - Low ADH: Less water reabsorbed, dilute urine
  - Secreted by posterior pituitary when body dehydrated

**Sodium Reabsorption:**
- 65% in PCT (obligatory)
- Variable amounts in DCT and collecting duct
- Regulated by **aldosterone** (adrenal hormone)
  - Increases Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion
  - Released when blood pressure low or Na+ low

#### Tubular Secretion

Movement of substances from blood into filtrate

**Functions:**
- Eliminates undesirable substances
- Disposes of drugs, toxins
- Regulates blood pH (H+, K+ secretion)

**Substances Secreted:**
- **H+:** PCT, DCT, collecting duct (acid-base balance)
- **K+:** DCT, collecting duct (regulated by aldosterone)
- **NH₃ and NH₄+:** PCT (from amino acid metabolism)
- **Drugs and Toxins:** PCT (penicillin, aspirin, etc.)
- **Organic Acids and Bases**

### Regulation of Urine Concentration and Volume

**Countercurrent Mechanism:**

Involves loops of Henle and vasa recta

**Creates Osmotic Gradient in Medulla:**
- Cortex: isotonic (~300 mOsm)
- Outer medulla: hypertonic (~600 mOsm)
- Inner medulla: very hypertonic (~1200 mOsm)

**Process:**
1. Ascending limb actively transports NaCl out (impermeable to water) → dilute filtrate
2. NaCl accumulates in medulla → hypertonic
3. Descending limb permeable to water → water moves out → concentrated filtrate
4. Vasa recta (blood vessels) parallel loops, preserving gradient
5. Collecting duct passes through hypertonic medulla
   - With ADH: Water reabsorbed → concentrated urine
   - Without ADH: Little water reabsorbed → dilute urine

**Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):**
- Also called vasopressin
- Secreted by posterior pituitary
- **Stimuli for Release:**
  - High blood osmolarity (dehydration)
  - Low blood volume/pressure
  - Alcohol inhibits ADH (increases urine output)
- **Action:** Inserts aquaporins in collecting duct → increases water reabsorption

**Aldosterone:**
- Steroid hormone from adrenal cortex
- **Stimuli for Release:**
  - Low blood Na+
  - High blood K+
  - Angiotensin II (RAAS)
- **Action:** Increases Na+ reabsorption (and water follows), K+ secretion in DCT and collecting duct

**Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP):**
- Released by atrial cells when blood volume/pressure high
- **Actions:**
  - Inhibits Na+ reabsorption → more Na+ and water excreted
  - Dilates afferent arterioles, constricts efferent → increases GFR
  - Inhibits renin and aldosterone release
  - **Net Effect:** Decreases blood volume and pressure

### Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)

Hormonal cascade regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance

**Triggers:**
- Low blood pressure
- Low blood volume
- Low Na+ in filtrate
- Sympathetic stimulation

**Cascade:**

1. **Kidneys release renin** (from JG cells)
2. **Renin converts angiotensinogen → angiotensin I** (in blood)
3. **ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) converts angiotensin I → angiotensin II** (in lungs)
4. **Angiotensin II:**
   - **Vasoconstriction** (systemic) → increases blood pressure
   - Stimulates **aldosterone release** (adrenal cortex) → Na+ and water retention
   - Stimulates **ADH release** (posterior pituitary) → water retention
   - Stimulates **thirst** (hypothalamus)
   - Constricts efferent arteriole → maintains GFR

**Net Effect:** Increases blood volume and blood pressure

### Acid-Base Balance

Kidneys regulate blood pH (7.35-7.45) by secreting or reabsorbing H+ and HCO₃⁻

**Mechanisms:**

**Secretion of H+:**
- PCT, DCT, collecting duct
- Lowers blood acidity

**Reabsorption of HCO₃⁻:**
- Bicarbonate is a buffer (alkaline)
- Reabsorbed in PCT (90%), DCT, collecting duct

**Secretion of NH₃/NH₄+:**
- Ammonia (NH₃) produced from glutamine in PCT cells
- Combines with H+ → NH₄+ (ammonium)
- Excreted in urine
- Allows excretion of H+ without making urine too acidic

**Formation of Titratable Acids:**
- H+ binds to phosphate buffers in filtrate
- Excreted as H₂PO₄⁻

**Compensation for pH Imbalances:**

**Acidosis (pH <7.35):**
- Kidneys increase H+ secretion, HCO₃⁻ reabsorption
- Produces acidic urine (pH ~4.5-5.5)

**Alkalosis (pH >7.45):**
- Kidneys decrease H+ secretion, excrete HCO₃⁻
- Produces alkaline urine (pH ~8.0-8.5)

**Response Time:** Slower than respiratory system (hours to days) but more powerful

### Micturition (Urination)

**Ureters:**
- Muscular tubes (~25-30 cm long)

2. **Stretch receptors** in bladder wall activated
3. **Parasympathetic signals:**
   - Detrusor muscle contracts
   - Internal sphincter relaxes
4. **Urge to urinate** reaches consciousness
5. **Voluntary control:**
   - External sphincter relaxed (voluntary) → urination

**Location:** Breasts

**Structure:**

**Lobes (15-20 per breast):**
- Contain lobules with milk-secreting alveoli

**Lactiferous Ducts:**
- Drain milk from lobes
- Converge at nipple

**Lactiferous Sinuses:**
- Widen portions of ducts (store milk)

**Nipple:**
- Pigmented projection
- Surrounded by areola

**Suspensory (Cooper's) Ligaments:**
- Support breast

**Development:**
- **Puberty:** Estrogen stimulates duct development; progesterone stimulates alveoli
- **Pregnancy:** Estrogen, progesterone, prolactin stimulate full development
- **Lactation:** Prolactin stimulates milk production; oxytocin stimulates milk ejection

### Menstrual (Ovarian and Uterine) Cycle

Coordinated monthly cycles

**Average Length:** 28 days (varies 21-35 days)

**Day 1:** First day of menstruation

#### Ovarian Cycle

**Follicular Phase (Days 1-14):**
- **FSH** stimulates follicle development
- Follicles secrete estrogen
- Dominant follicle selected (~day 7)
- **Rising estrogen** → positive feedback → LH surge (day 14)

**Ovulation (Day 14):**
- LH surge triggers ovulation
- Secondary oocyte released

**Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):**
- Ruptured follicle → corpus luteum
- Corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogen
- **If No Pregnancy:**
  - Corpus luteum degenerates (day 24-28)
  - Hormone levels drop
  - Menstruation begins
- **If Pregnancy:**
  - hCG (from embryo) maintains corpus luteum
  - Pregnancy hormones produced

#### Uterine (Menstrual) Cycle

**Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):**
- Stratum functionalis shed
- Menstrual flow: Blood, tissue, mucus (~50-150 mL total)

**Proliferative Phase (Days 6-14):**
- **Estrogen** stimulates endometrial growth
- Stratum functionalis regenerates
- Endometrium thickens
- Glands elongate

**Secretory Phase (Days 15-28):**
- **Progesterone** prepares endometrium for implantation
- Endometrium becomes secretory (glycogen-rich)
- Glands coil, blood supply increases
- Optimal for embryo implantation (days 20-24)
- If no implantation: hormone levels drop → menstruation

### Hormonal Regulation

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) Axis:**

**Hypothalamus:**
- Secretes **GnRH** (pulsatile)
- Stimulates anterior pituitary

**Anterior Pituitary:**
- **FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone):**
  - Stimulates follicle development
  - Stimulates estrogen secretion
- **LH (Luteinizing Hormone):**
  - Triggers ovulation
  - Stimulates corpus luteum formation
  - Stimulates progesterone secretion

**Ovaries:**
- **Estrogen:**
  - Low-to-moderate levels: Negative feedback (inhibits FSH, LH)
  - High levels (late follicular phase): Positive feedback → LH surge
- **Progesterone:**
  - Negative feedback (inhibits GnRH, FSH, LH)
- **Inhibin:**
  - Negative feedback (inhibits FSH)

### Pregnancy, Parturition, and Lactation

**Fertilization:**
- Usually in ampulla of uterine tube
- Sperm penetrates secondary oocyte
- Oocyte completes meiosis II
- Genetic material fuses (zygote formed)

**Early Development:**
- Zygote undergoes cleavage (cell divisions)
- Forms morula, then blastocyst
- Reaches uterus ~3-4 days post-fertilization

**Implantation:**
- Blastocyst implants in endometrium (~6-7 days post-fertilization)
- **Trophoblast:** Outer layer; forms placenta
- Secretes **hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin):**
  - Maintains corpus luteum
  - Basis of pregnancy tests

**Placenta:**
- Forms from trophoblast and maternal endometrium
- Functions: Gas exchange, nutrient/waste exchange, hormone production
- **Hormones:**
  - **hCG:** Maintains corpus luteum (first trimester)
  - **Estrogen and Progesterone:** Maintain pregnancy (placenta takes over from corpus luteum)
  - **Human Placental Lactogen (hPL):** Prepares breasts for lactation

**Pregnancy Duration:** ~40 weeks (280 days) from last menstrual period

**Parturition (Childbirth):**

Initiated by complex hormonal interactions

**Labor Stages:**

1. **Dilation Stage:**
   - Cervix dilates to 10 cm
   - Longest stage (hours)

2. **Expulsion Stage:**
   - Baby delivered (minutes to hours)

3. **Placental Stage:**
   - Placenta delivered (15-30 minutes)

**Hormones:**
- **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions
- **Prostaglandins:** Soften cervix, enhance contractions
- **Relaxin:** Softens cervix, relaxes pelvic ligaments

**Positive Feedback Loop:**
- Fetal head stretches cervix → oxytocin release → stronger contractions → more stretching → more oxytocin

**Lactation:**

**Prolactin:**
- Stimulates milk production
- Inhibited during pregnancy (high estrogen/progesterone)
- Increases after birth (hormone levels drop)

**Oxytocin:**
- Stimulates milk ejection (let-down reflex)
- Triggered by infant suckling

**Colostrum:**
- First milk (days 1-3)
- Rich in antibodies (IgA), proteins, lower fat

**Mature Milk:**
- Appears by day 3-5
- Balanced nutrients

### Menopause

Permanent cessation of menstrual cycles

**Age:** Average ~51 years (range 45-55)

**Cause:** Ovarian follicle depletion

**Hormonal Changes:**
- Estrogen and progesterone decline
- FSH and LH increase (loss of negative feedback)

**Symptoms:**
- Irregular periods (perimenopause)
- Hot flashes, night sweats
- Vaginal dryness
- Mood changes
- Bone loss (increased osteoporosis risk)
- Cardiovascular changes

**Andropause (Male):**
- Gradual testosterone decline with age
- Less abrupt than menopause
- Symptoms: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, muscle loss, fatigue

### Clinical Relevance for Herbal Medicine

- Prostatitis
- Erectile dysfunction
- Low libido
- Infertility

**Relevant Herbal Actions:**
- **Emmenagogue:** Promotes menstrual flow
- **Uterine Tonic:** Tones uterine muscle
- **Hormone Modulator:** Balances hormones (phytoestrogens, progesterone-like effects)
- **Galactagogue:** Promotes milk production
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Reduces reproductive tissue inflammation
- **Antispasmodic:** Relieves menstrual cramps
- **Astringent:** Reduces heavy menstrual bleeding
- **Aphrodisiac:** Enhances libido

**Herbal Considerations:**
- **Contraindications in Pregnancy:** Many herbs contraindicated; some safe in specific trimesters
- **Breastfeeding:** Most herbs pass into breast milk; use caution
- **Hormone-Sensitive Conditions:** Some herbs contraindicated with estrogen-sensitive cancers, endometriosis
- **Drug Interactions:** Hormone modulators may interact with birth control, HRT
- **BPH herbs:** May reduce symptoms but should be monitored by physician
- **Fertility herbs:** Work best with lifestyle, dietary changes; require patience (3-6 months)
- **Menopausal herbs:** Phytoestrogens provide gentle hormone support
- **Timing:** Some herbs best at specific cycle phases (e.g., emmenagogues in luteal phase)
