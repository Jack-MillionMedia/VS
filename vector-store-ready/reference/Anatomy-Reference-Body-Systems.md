## 1. The Integumentary System

### Overview

The integumentary system consists of the skin and its accessory structures: hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. As the body's largest organ system, the integumentary system serves as the primary barrier between the internal body and external environment.

### Primary Functions

- **Protection:** Forms a physical barrier against pathogens, chemicals, UV radiation, and mechanical injury
- **Thermoregulation:** Regulates body temperature through sweat production and blood vessel dilation/constriction
- **Sensation:** Contains sensory receptors for touch, pressure, temperature, and pain
- **Vitamin D Synthesis:** Produces vitamin D when exposed to UV radiation
- **Excretion:** Eliminates small amounts of waste products through sweat
- **Immune Defense:** Houses immune cells and produces antimicrobial peptides

### Structural Components

#### Skin Layers

**Epidermis (Outer Layer)**

The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium composed of five distinct layers from deepest to superficial:

1. **Stratum Basale (Basal Layer):** Single layer of stem cells that continuously divide to produce new keratinocytes. Contains melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) and Merkel cells (touch receptors).

2. **Stratum Spinosum (Spiny Layer):** Several layers of keratinocytes connected by desmosomes, giving a "spiny" appearance. Contains Langerhans cells (immune cells).

3. **Stratum Granulosum (Granular Layer):** 3-5 layers of flattened keratinocytes containing keratohyalin granules. Cells begin to die and accumulate keratin.

4. **Stratum Lucidum (Clear Layer):** Thin, translucent layer found only in thick skin (palms and soles). Contains dead, flattened keratinocytes densely packed with eleidin, a clear protein.

5. **Stratum Corneum (Horny Layer):** 15-30 layers of dead, keratinized cells that are continuously shed and replaced. Provides waterproofing and protection against pathogens and abrasion.

The entire epidermis is replaced approximately every 4 weeks through continuous cell division in the stratum basale and upward migration of cells.

**Dermis (Middle Layer)**

The dermis is a thick layer of connective tissue composed of two regions:

1. **Papillary Layer:** Superficial layer of loose, areolar connective tissue. Contains capillaries, nerve endings (including Meissner corpuscles for light touch), and lymphatic vessels. Forms fingerlike projections (dermal papillae) that extend into the epidermis.

2. **Reticular Layer:** Deeper, thicker layer composed of dense irregular connective tissue. Contains larger blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. Elastin and collagen fibers provide strength, elasticity, and structure.

**Hypodermis (Subcutaneous Layer)**

Not technically part of the skin, but closely associated. Composed of loose areolar and adipose (fat) tissue that:
- Connects skin to underlying fascia of muscles and bones
- Provides insulation and cushioning
- Stores energy in the form of fat
- Houses larger blood vessels and nerves

#### Skin Pigmentation

Skin color is determined by three pigments:

1. **Melanin:** Brown-black (eumelanin) and red-yellow (pheomelanin) pigments produced by melanocytes. Provides protection against UV radiation. Sun exposure stimulates increased melanin production (tanning).

2. **Carotene:** Yellow-orange pigment from dietary sources, stored in stratum corneum and adipose tissue.

3. **Hemoglobin:** Red pigment in blood visible through translucent skin, particularly in areas with rich capillary beds.

#### Accessory Structures

**Hair**

- Composed of keratinized dead cells
- Growth begins in hair follicle (invagination of epidermis into dermis)
- Hair shaft: visible portion above skin surface
- Hair root: portion within follicle, anchored by hair bulb
- Hair matrix: actively dividing basal cells that produce hair
- Arrector pili muscle: smooth muscle that causes "goosebumps" when contracted
- Functions: protection, sensory reception, thermoregulation

**Nails**

- Composed of densely packed dead keratinocytes
- Nail body: visible portion
- Nail bed: underlying epidermis
- Nail matrix: actively dividing cells that enable nail growth
- Functions: protection of fingertips and toes, aid in grasping small objects

**Glands**

*Sebaceous Glands:*
- Oil glands associated with hair follicles
- Secrete sebum (mixture of lipids) that:
  - Lubricates and waterproofs skin and hair
  - Has antibacterial properties
  - Prevents water loss
- Activity increases at puberty (androgen stimulation)

*Sweat Glands (Sudoriferous Glands):*

1. **Eccrine Glands:**
   - Most numerous, found throughout body
   - Open directly onto skin surface
   - Produce watery sweat for thermoregulation
   - Sweat composition: water, salts, vitamin C, antibodies, dermicidin (antimicrobial peptide)

2. **Apocrine Glands:**
   - Located in axillary and genital regions
   - Open into hair follicles
   - Produce thicker, lipid-rich sweat
   - Bacterial decomposition produces body odor
   - Activity controlled by hormones

### Thermoregulation Mechanisms

**Cooling Mechanisms (When body is warm):**
- Eccrine sweat glands produce sweat; evaporation cools skin surface
- Dermal arterioles dilate (vasodilation), increasing blood flow to skin and heat dissipation
- Visible as skin reddening during exercise

**Warming Mechanisms (When body is cold):**
- Sweat production decreases
- Dermal arterioles constrict (vasoconstriction), reducing blood flow to skin and conserving core body heat
- Arrector pili muscles contract, trapping air layer for insulation (goosebumps)
- Visible as pale or white skin in cold conditions

### Wound Healing Process

Skin repair occurs in overlapping stages:

1. **Hemostasis:** Blood clot forms to stop bleeding and protect underlying tissue

2. **Inflammatory Phase:** White blood cells (macrophages, neutrophils) remove debris and pathogens

3. **Proliferative Phase:** 
   - Fibroblasts produce collagen to repair damaged tissue (granulation tissue)
   - Blood vessels regenerate
   - Epithelial cells migrate to close wound

4. **Maturation Phase:** Collagen remodeling strengthens repaired tissue, forming scar

**Scarring:** Scar tissue is collagen-rich but lacks original skin structure (no hair follicles, glands, normal pigmentation)

### Clinical Relevance for Herbal Medicine

**Topical Applications:**
- Herbs applied to skin must penetrate stratum corneum barrier
- Lipophilic compounds penetrate more easily through sebum-rich areas
- Wounds with disrupted epidermis allow increased absorption

**Common Skin Conditions Treated Herbally:**
- Inflammatory conditions (eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis)
- Wound healing and tissue repair
- Burns (first, second, and third degree)
- Acne and bacterial/fungal infections
- Dry skin and moisture retention issues

**Relevant Herbal Actions:**
- Vulnerary (wound healing)
- Emollient (skin softening)
- Demulcent (soothing and protective)
- Anti-inflammatory
- Antimicrobial
- Astringent (tissue tightening)

## 2. The Skeletal System

### Overview

The skeletal system consists of bones, cartilages, and ligaments that provide the rigid framework supporting the body. The adult skeleton contains 206 bones, with each bone serving specific mechanical and metabolic functions.

### Primary Functions

- **Support:** Provides structural framework for the body and supports soft tissues
- **Protection:** Shields internal organs (skull protects brain, ribs protect heart and lungs)
- **Movement:** Serves as attachment points and levers for skeletal muscles
- **Mineral Storage:** Stores calcium and phosphate; releases minerals to maintain blood levels
- **Blood Cell Production (Hematopoiesis):** Red bone marrow produces blood cells
- **Energy Storage:** Yellow bone marrow stores fat (triglycerides)

### Bone Classification by Shape

1. **Long Bones:** Longer than wide; facilitate movement and leverage (femur, humerus, phalanges)
2. **Short Bones:** Cube-shaped; provide stability and limited motion (carpals, tarsals)
3. **Flat Bones:** Thin and curved; protect organs and provide muscle attachment (skull bones, ribs, sternum, scapula)
4. **Irregular Bones:** Complex shape; specialized functions (vertebrae, facial bones)
5. **Sesamoid Bones:** Embedded in tendons where high pressure develops (patella)

### Bone Structure

#### Gross Anatomy of Long Bones

- **Diaphysis:** Central shaft composed of compact bone surrounding medullary cavity
- **Epiphyses:** Expanded ends composed of spongy bone covered by thin layer of compact bone; site of articulation
- **Metaphyses:** Regions between diaphysis and epiphyses; contains epiphyseal plate (growth plate) in growing bones
- **Articular Cartilage:** Hyaline cartilage covering epiphyses at joint surfaces; reduces friction
- **Periosteum:** Dense fibrous connective tissue membrane covering outer bone surface; site of muscle and ligament attachment
- **Endosteum:** Thin membrane lining medullary cavity and internal bone surfaces
- **Medullary Cavity:** Central hollow space containing bone marrow

#### Bone Tissue Types

**Compact (Cortical) Bone:**
- Dense, solid appearance
- Forms outer shell of all bones and diaphysis of long bones
- Composed of osteons (Haversian systems):
  - Central (Haversian) canal contains blood vessels and nerves
  - Concentric lamellae (rings) of bone matrix surround canal
  - Osteocytes (bone cells) housed in lacunae between lamellae
  - Canaliculi (tiny channels) connect lacunae, allowing nutrient/waste exchange

**Spongy (Cancellous/Trabecular) Bone:**
- Lattice-like network of bone spicules (trabeculae)
- Found in epiphyses of long bones and interior of flat bones
- Spaces filled with red or yellow bone marrow
- Lighter weight; provides strength with reduced mass
- Arrangement follows stress lines for maximum strength

#### Bone Marrow

**Red Marrow:**
- Hematopoietically active
- Produces red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
- Found in flat bones (sternum, ribs, pelvis, skull) and epiphyses of long bones in adults
- All bone marrow is red in infants and children

**Yellow Marrow:**
- Composed primarily of adipose tissue
- Functions as energy reserve
- Fills medullary cavities of long bones in adults
- Can convert back to red marrow if increased blood cell production needed

### Bone Matrix Composition

- Proteoglycans and glycoproteins bind water and minerals

**Inorganic Components (65%):**
- Calcium phosphate crystals (hydroxyapatite) provide hardness and compressive strength
- Calcium carbonate
- Other minerals: magnesium, fluoride, sulfate

### Bone Cells

1. **Osteogenic Cells:** Stem cells that differentiate into osteoblasts; found in periosteum and endosteum

2. **Osteoblasts:** Bone-building cells that secrete osteoid (unmineralized bone matrix) and initiate calcification

3. **Osteocytes:** Mature bone cells housed in lacunae; maintain bone matrix and sense mechanical stress

4. **Osteoclasts:** Large, multinucleated cells that resorb (break down) bone matrix; derived from white blood cells

### Bone Development and Growth

#### Ossification (Bone Formation)

**Intramembranous Ossification:**
- Bone forms directly from mesenchyme (embryonic connective tissue)
- Produces flat bones of skull, clavicles, and mandible
- Process:
  1. Mesenchyme cells cluster and differentiate into osteoblasts
  2. Osteoblasts secrete osteoid, which calcifies
  3. Woven bone forms and is later remodeled into compact/spongy bone
  4. Periosteum develops

**Endochondral Ossification:**
- Bone forms by replacing hyaline cartilage model
- Produces most bones of skeleton
- Process:
  1. Mesenchyme forms cartilage model
  2. Primary ossification center develops in diaphysis
  3. Secondary ossification centers develop in epiphyses
  4. Epiphyseal plates (growth plates) remain between diaphysis and epiphyses
  5. Bone lengthens as cartilage grows and is replaced by bone
  6. Epiphyseal plates ossify in late adolescence/early twenties, ending growth

#### Bone Remodeling

- Continuous process of bone resorption and deposition
- Functions: reshapes bone in response to stress, repairs microfractures, maintains calcium homeostasis
- Coordinated activity of osteoclasts (resorb) and osteoblasts (deposit)
- Influenced by mechanical stress, hormones (PTH, calcitonin, growth hormone, sex hormones), vitamins (D, C, A, K)

**Hormonal Regulation:**

1. **Parathyroid Hormone (PTH):**
   - Released when blood calcium low
   - Stimulates osteoclasts to resorb bone, releasing calcium
   - Increases calcium reabsorption in kidneys
   - Activates vitamin D for increased intestinal calcium absorption

2. **Calcitonin:**
   - Released when blood calcium high

- Maintained by:
  - **Sodium-Potassium Pump:** Actively transports 3 Na+ out, 2 K+ in (ATP-dependent)
  - **Leak Channels:** K+ leaks out faster than Na+ leaks in
  - **Large Anions:** Trapped inside cell (proteins, phosphates)

#### Action Potential

All-or-nothing electrical signal conducted along axon

**Phases:**

1. **Resting State:** Membrane at resting potential (-70 mV)

2. **Depolarization:**
   - Stimulus opens voltage-gated Na+ channels
   - Na+ rushes into cell
   - Membrane potential becomes positive (+30 mV)

3. **Repolarization:**
   - Na+ channels inactivate
   - Voltage-gated K+ channels open
   - K+ exits cell
   - Membrane returns to negative

4. **Hyperpolarization:**
   - K+ channels slow to close
   - Membrane briefly more negative than resting (-80 mV)

5. **Return to Resting Potential:**
   - Na+/K+ pump restores ion distribution
   - Leak channels maintain resting potential

**Properties:**
- **All-or-None:** Action potential either occurs fully or not at all
- **Refractory Periods:**

2. **Voltage-gated Ca²+ channels** open; calcium enters
3. **Synaptic vesicles** fuse with membrane, release neurotransmitter into synaptic cleft
4. **Neurotransmitter diffuses** across cleft, binds to receptors on postsynaptic membrane
5. **Ion channels open or close** in postsynaptic cell
6. **Postsynaptic potential** generated (excitatory or inhibitory)
7. **Neurotransmitter removed** from cleft by:
   - Reuptake into presynaptic neuron
   - Enzymatic degradation
   - Diffusion away from synapse

- **Respiratory Pump:** Breathing movements create pressure changes that aid return
- **Valves:** Prevent backflow

### Heart Structure

Muscular pump; approximately size of fist; located in mediastinum

#### Coverings and Layers

**Pericardium:**
- **Fibrous Pericardium:** Tough outer sac; protects, anchors heart
- **Serous Pericardium:**
  - Parietal Layer: Lines fibrous pericardium
  - Visceral Layer (Epicardium): Adheres to heart surface
  - Pericardial Cavity: Fluid-filled space between layers; reduces friction

**Heart Wall Layers (outer to inner):**
1. **Epicardium:** Visceral pericardium; serous membrane
2. **Myocardium:** Thick middle layer; cardiac muscle; contracts to pump blood
3. **Endocardium:** Smooth inner lining; continuous with vessel endothelium

#### Heart Chambers

**Atria (Upper Chambers):**
- Receiving chambers
- **Right Atrium:** Receives deoxygenated blood from body via superior and inferior vena cavae and coronary sinus
- **Left Atrium:** Receives oxygenated blood from lungs via four pulmonary veins
- Thin-walled (low pressure)

**Ventricles (Lower Chambers):**
- Pumping chambers
- **Right Ventricle:** Pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs via pulmonary trunk
- **Left Ventricle:** Pumps oxygenated blood to body via aorta
- Thick-walled (especially left; pumps against greater resistance)

**Septum:** Wall separating right and left sides

#### Heart Valves

Ensure one-way blood flow

**Atrioventricular (AV) Valves:**
Between atria and ventricles; prevent backflow into atria

- **Tricuspid Valve:** Right AV valve (3 cusps)
- **Mitral (Bicuspid) Valve:** Left AV valve (2 cusps)
- **Chordae Tendineae:** "Heart strings"; anchor cusps to papillary muscles
- **Papillary Muscles:** Contract to prevent valve prolapse

**Semilunar Valves:**
Between ventricles and arteries; prevent backflow into ventricles

- **Pulmonary Valve:** Right ventricle to pulmonary trunk
- **Aortic Valve:** Left ventricle to aorta
- Three cusps each; open when ventricles contract; close when ventricles relax

### Coronary Circulation

Heart muscle requires constant oxygen supply

**Coronary Arteries:**
Branch from base of aorta; supply myocardium

- **Right Coronary Artery:** Supplies right atrium, right ventricle, inferior left ventricle
- **Left Coronary Artery:** Branches into:
  - **Left Anterior Descending (LAD):** Supplies anterior left ventricle, septum
  - **Circumflex Artery:** Supplies left atrium, lateral/posterior left ventricle

**Cardiac Veins:**
Drain deoxygenated blood into coronary sinus → right atrium

**Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):**
- Atherosclerosis narrows coronary arteries
- Reduces blood flow to myocardium (ischemia)
- Can cause angina (chest pain) or myocardial infarction (heart attack)

### Cardiac Physiology

#### Cardiac Cycle

Sequence of events during one complete heartbeat (~0.8 seconds at rest)

**Systole:** Contraction; blood ejected

**Diastole:** Relaxation; chambers fill

**Phases:**

1. **Atrial Systole:**
   - Atria contract
   - Blood pushed into ventricles ("atrial kick" - 20-30% of filling)
   - Ventricles nearly full

2. **Ventricular Systole:**
   - Ventricles contract
   - AV valves close (first heart sound "lub")
   - Pressure rises
   - Semilunar valves open
   - Blood ejected into aorta and pulmonary trunk

3. **Isovolumetric Relaxation:**
   - Ventricles relax
   - Semilunar valves close (second heart sound "dub")
   - All valves closed briefly
   - Pressure drops

4. **Ventricular Filling:**
   - AV valves open
   - Blood flows from atria into ventricles (passive filling ~70%)
   - Ventricles expand

**Stroke Volume (SV):** Volume ejected per beat (~70 mL)

**Cardiac Output (CO):** Volume pumped per minute
- CO = Heart Rate × Stroke Volume
- Average: 5 liters/minute at rest
- Can increase 5-fold during exercise

#### Electrical Conduction System

Heart generates its own electrical impulses (autorhythmic)

**Components:**

1. **Sinoatrial (SA) Node:**
   - Located in right atrium wall
   - "Pacemaker" of heart
   - Generates impulses ~75 times/minute at rest
   - Sets heart rate

2. **Atrioventricular (AV) Node:**
   - Located in interatrial septum
   - Delays impulse ~0.1 second (allows atria to contract before ventricles)

3. **AV Bundle (Bundle of His):**
   - Penetrates interventricular septum
   - Only electrical connection between atria and ventricles

4. **Bundle Branches:**
   - Right and left bundle branches
   - Travel down septum toward apex

5. **Purkinje Fibers:**
   - Branch throughout ventricular myocardium
   - Rapidly distribute impulse
   - Ventricles contract from apex upward

**Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):**
Graphic recording of electrical activity

- **P Wave:** Atrial depolarization (contraction)
- **QRS Complex:** Ventricular depolarization (contraction); atrial repolarization hidden
- **T Wave:** Ventricular repolarization (relaxation)

#### Cardiac Output Regulation

**Heart Rate Control:**

*Autonomic Nervous System:*
- **Sympathetic:** Increases heart rate (norepinephrine)
- **Parasympathetic:** Decreases heart rate (acetylcholine via vagus nerve)

*Hormones:*
- Epinephrine: Increases heart rate and contractility
- Thyroid Hormones: Increase heart rate

*Other Factors:*
- Age, fitness, body temperature, ion concentrations

**Stroke Volume Control:**

Three factors determine SV:

1. **Preload (End-Diastolic Volume):**
   - Amount of stretch on ventricles before contraction
   - Greater stretch → stronger contraction (Frank-Starling law)
   - Increased by increased venous return

2. **Contractility:**
   - Force of contraction at given preload
   - Increased by sympathetic stimulation, epinephrine, calcium
   - Decreased by acidosis, hypoxia, some medications

3. **Afterload:**
   - Resistance ventricles must overcome to eject blood
   - Increased by elevated blood pressure or vasoconstriction
   - Decreased afterload increases stroke volume

### Blood Pressure

Force exerted by blood against vessel walls

**Measurement:**
- **Systolic Pressure:** Pressure during ventricular contraction (normal: <120 mmHg)
- **Diastolic Pressure:** Pressure during ventricular relaxation (normal: <80 mmHg)
- Expressed as systolic/diastolic (e.g., 120/80)

**Factors Affecting Blood Pressure:**

1. **Cardiac Output:** Increased CO increases BP
2. **Blood Volume:** More blood increases BP
3. **Peripheral Resistance:** Narrower vessels increase BP
4. **Blood Viscosity:** Thicker blood increases BP
5. **Vessel Elasticity:** Stiff vessels increase BP

**Short-Term Regulation:**

*Baroreceptor Reflex:*
- Pressure receptors in carotid and aortic arch
- Increase in BP → decreased heart rate and vasodilation
- Decrease in BP → increased heart rate and vasoconstriction

*Chemoreceptor Reflex:*
- Respond to O₂, CO₂, H+ levels
- Low O₂ or high CO₂ → increased heart rate and BP

*Hormones:*
- Epinephrine/Norepinephrine: Increase heart rate, contractility, vasoconstriction
- ANP: Decreases BP (vasodilation, increased fluid excretion)
- ADH: Increases BP (water retention, vasoconstriction)

**Long-Term Regulation:**

*Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):*
1. Kidneys release renin (when BP drops)
2. Renin converts angiotensinogen → angiotensin I
3. ACE converts angiotensin I → angiotensin II
4. Angiotensin II:
   - Potent vasoconstrictor
   - Stimulates aldosterone release (sodium/water retention)
   - Stimulates ADH release (water retention)
   - Increases BP

**Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):**
- BP consistently ≥130/80 mmHg
- Major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, kidney disease
- Often asymptomatic ("silent killer")

**Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure):**
- May cause dizziness, fainting, inadequate tissue perfusion
- Can result from dehydration, blood loss, heart problems

### Circulatory Pathways

**Pulmonary Circulation:**
Right side of heart → lungs → left side of heart

- Right ventricle → pulmonary trunk → pulmonary arteries → lung capillaries (gas exchange) → pulmonary veins → left atrium
- Deoxygenated blood becomes oxygenated

**Systemic Circulation:**
Left side of heart → body tissues → right side of heart

- Left ventricle → aorta → systemic arteries → capillaries (gas/nutrient exchange) → systemic veins → vena cavae → right atrium
- Oxygenated blood becomes deoxygenated

**Major Systemic Arteries:**
- **Aorta:** Largest artery; three regions (ascending, arch, descending)
- **Carotid Arteries:** Supply head and neck
- **Subclavian Arteries:** Supply upper limbs
- **Celiac Trunk, Mesenteric Arteries:** Supply digestive organs

- **Inferior Vena Cava:** Drains abdomen, pelvis, lower limbs
- **Jugular Veins:** Drain head and neck
- **Hepatic Portal System:** Blood from digestive organs → liver → hepatic veins → inferior vena cava

## 7. The Lymphatic and Immune Systems

### Overview

The lymphatic system is a network of vessels, organs, and tissues that works closely with the cardiovascular and immune systems. It returns excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream, absorbs dietary fats, and provides immune defense. The immune system protects the body from pathogens, foreign substances, and abnormal cells.

### Primary Functions

- **Fluid Balance:** Returns excess interstitial fluid (lymph) to cardiovascular system
- **Fat Absorption:** Absorbs lipids and fat-soluble vitamins from digestive tract
- **Immune Defense:** Produces, maintains, and distributes lymphocytes
- **Waste Removal:** Filters and removes cellular debris and pathogens
- **Immune Surveillance:** Monitors body for foreign invaders and abnormal cells

### Lymphatic System Components

**Composition:**
- Similar to plasma but lower protein concentration
- Contains white blood cells (especially lymphocytes)
- May contain pathogens, cancer cells, cellular debris
- Absorbed dietary fats (in intestinal lymph - appears milky, called chyle)

**Formation:**
- Blood pressure forces fluid out of capillaries into tissues (filtration)
- Approximately 3 liters per day not reabsorbed by blood capillaries
- Excess fluid enters lymphatic capillaries → becomes lymph

#### Lymphatic Vessels

- Sea level: 760 mmHg
- Reference point (0 mmHg)

**Intrapulmonary (Alveolar) Pressure (Ppul):**
- Pressure within alveoli
- Fluctuates with breathing
- Inspiration: Falls below atmospheric
- Expiration: Rises above atmospheric

**Intrapleural Pressure (Pip):**
- Pressure within pleural cavity
- Always negative (subatmospheric)
- Becomes more negative during inspiration

**Transpulmonary Pressure:**
- Difference between intrapulmonary and intrapleural pressure
- Keeps lungs inflated

#### Inspiration (Inhalation)

Active process; requires muscle contraction

**Steps:**

1. **Inspiratory Muscles Contract:**
   - **Diaphragm:** Primary muscle
     - Dome-shaped; separates thorax from abdomen
     - Contracts → flattens → increases vertical dimension of thoracic cavity
   - **External Intercostals:** 
     - Between ribs
     - Contract → lift rib cage up and out → increases anterior-posterior and lateral dimensions

2. **Thoracic Cavity Volume Increases:**
   - Intrapulmonary pressure decreases (Boyle's Law: P ∝ 1/V)
   - Pressure falls ~2 mmHg below atmospheric (~758 mmHg)

3. **Air Flows Into Lungs:**
   - Air flows from high pressure (atmosphere) to low pressure (alveoli)
   - Continues until pressures equalize

**Forced (Deep) Inspiration:**
- Accessory muscles activated
- **Sternocleidomastoid:** Elevates sternum
- **Scalenes:** Elevate first two ribs
- **Pectoralis Minor:** Elevates ribs 3-5

#### Expiration (Exhalation)

Passive process at rest; active during forced breathing

**Quiet Expiration:**

Passive; relies on elastic recoil

1. **Inspiratory Muscles Relax:**
   - Diaphragm relaxes → returns to dome shape
   - External intercostals relax → rib cage falls

2. **Thoracic Cavity Volume Decreases:**
   - Elastic recoil of lungs and chest wall
   - Intrapulmonary pressure increases (~762 mmHg)

3. **Air Flows Out of Lungs:**
   - Air flows from high pressure (alveoli) to low pressure (atmosphere)

**Forced Expiration:**

Active; requires muscle contraction

- **Internal Intercostals:** Depress rib cage
- **Abdominal Muscles:** Compress abdomen, push diaphragm up
  - Rectus abdominis

   - Maximum volume lungs can hold
   - ~6,000 mL

**Dead Space:**
- Air that doesn't participate in gas exchange
- **Anatomical Dead Space:** Conducting airways (~150 mL)
- **Alveolar Dead Space:** Non-perfused alveoli (normally minimal)
- **Physiological Dead Space:** Anatomical + alveolar

**Alveolar Ventilation Rate:**
- Volume of air per minute reaching alveoli
- More important than total ventilation
- AVR = (TV - Dead Space) × Respiratory Rate

### Gas Exchange

#### External Respiration

Gas exchange between alveoli and blood

**Partial Pressures:**
- Pressure exerted by individual gas in mixture
- Determines direction of diffusion
- **Dalton's Law:** Total pressure = sum of partial pressures

**Oxygen:**
- **Alveolar PO₂:** ~104 mmHg
- **Deoxygenated Blood PO₂:** ~40 mmHg
- Gradient: 64 mmHg
- **O₂ diffuses:** alveoli → blood
- **Oxygenated Blood PO₂:** ~104 mmHg

**Carbon Dioxide:**
- **Deoxygenated Blood PCO₂:** ~45 mmHg
- **Alveolar PCO₂:** ~40 mmHg
- Gradient: 5 mmHg
- **CO₂ diffuses:** blood → alveoli
- **Oxygenated Blood PCO₂:** ~40 mmHg

**Factors Affecting Gas Exchange:**

1. **Partial Pressure Gradients:** Greater gradient = faster diffusion
2. **Respiratory Membrane Thickness:** Thinner = faster diffusion
   - Pulmonary edema, fibrosis increase thickness (impaired exchange)
3. **Surface Area:** Greater area = more exchange
   - Emphysema destroys alveoli (reduced area)
4. **Ventilation-Perfusion Coupling:**
   - Matching of airflow and blood flow
   - Ensures efficient gas exchange

#### Internal Respiration

### Gas Transport in Blood

#### Oxygen Transport

**Dissolved in Plasma:**
- Only 1.5% of O₂
- Inadequate for tissue needs

**Bound to Hemoglobin:**
- 98.5% of O₂
- Each hemoglobin molecule binds 4 O₂ molecules
- Forms oxyhemoglobin (HbO₂)

**Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curve:**

S-shaped curve showing relationship between PO₂ and hemoglobin saturation

**At Lungs:**
- High PO₂ (~104 mmHg)
- Hemoglobin ~98% saturated
- Loads O₂

**At Tissues:**
- Lower PO₂ (~40 mmHg)
- Hemoglobin ~75% saturated at rest
- Unloads O₂
- Can unload more during exercise (PO₂ drops further)

**Factors Shifting Curve Right (Decreased Affinity - More O₂ Release):**
- Decreased pH (acidosis) - **Bohr Effect**
- Increased PCO₂
- Increased temperature
- Increased 2,3-BPG (in RBCs)
- **Occur in Active Tissues:** Ensures O₂ delivery where needed

**Carbon Monoxide Poisoning:**
- CO binds hemoglobin 200× more tightly than O₂
- Prevents O₂ binding and delivery
- Life-threatening

#### Carbon Dioxide Transport

**Dissolved in Plasma:**
- 7-10% of CO₂
- Creates PCO₂

**As Bicarbonate Ion (HCO₃⁻):**
- 70% of CO₂
- **In RBCs:**
  1. CO₂ + H₂O ↔ H₂CO₃ (carbonic acid)
     - Catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase enzyme
  2. H₂CO₃ ↔ H+ + HCO₃⁻
  3. HCO₃⁻ moves into plasma
  4. Cl⁻ moves into RBC (chloride shift - maintains electrical neutrality)
- **In Lungs:** Reaction reverses; CO₂ released

**Bound to Hemoglobin (Carbaminohemoglobin):**
- 20% of CO₂
- Binds to amino acids on globin chains (not heme groups)
- Deoxygenated hemoglobin binds CO₂ more readily

### Regulation of Breathing

- Pontine centers modulate

#### Chemical Control

Most important regulatory mechanism

**Chemoreceptors:**

Respond to changes in blood chemistry

**Central Chemoreceptors:**
- Located in medulla oblongata
- Monitor CSF pH (reflects blood PCO₂)
- **Respond primarily to PCO₂:**
  - Increased PCO₂ → decreased pH → stimulates breathing
  - Most powerful respiratory stimulus
- CO₂ crosses blood-brain barrier easily; H+ does not

**Peripheral Chemoreceptors:**
- **Carotid Bodies:** In carotid arteries
- **Aortic Bodies:** In aortic arch
- **Respond to:**
  - Decreased PO₂ (most important; activated when PO₂ <60 mmHg)
  - Increased PCO₂
  - Decreased pH (acidosis)

**Hypercapnia (Elevated CO₂):**
- Most common stimulus to breathe
- Increased ventilation eliminates excess CO₂

**Hypoxia (Low O₂):**
- Backup system
- Significant only when PO₂ very low

**Acidosis:**
- Stimulates breathing
- Eliminates CO₂, raises pH

#### Neural Control

**Higher Brain Centers:**
- Cerebral cortex: Voluntary control (holding breath, speaking)
- Hypothalamus: Emotional influences (fear, pain)
- Limbic system: Emotional breathing (laughing, crying)

**Reflexes:**

**Inflation (Hering-Breuer) Reflex:**
- Stretch receptors in lungs
- Prevents overinflation
- Important in infants; less so in adults

**Cough Reflex:**
- Irritants in respiratory tract
- Deep inspiration → glottis closes → forceful expiration
- Clears airways

**Sneeze Reflex:**
- Irritants in nasal cavity
- Similar to cough; air directed through nose

#### Other Influences

- **Exercise:** Anticipation and movement increase breathing (neural signals)
- **Body Temperature:** Fever increases breathing rate
- **Pain and Emotional States:** Alter breathing
- **Blood Pressure:** Elevated BP may inhibit breathing slightly

### Clinical Relevance for Herbal Medicine

**Herbal Considerations:**
- Expectorants help clear productive coughs but shouldn't be combined with cough suppressants
- Demulcents soothe dry, irritated airways
- Bronchodilators provide symptomatic relief in asthma/COPD but don't replace medications
- Anti-inflammatory herbs reduce chronic airway inflammation
- Antimicrobial herbs most effective in early stages of infection
- Steam inhalations enhance herb delivery to respiratory tract
- Some herbs (e.g., lobelia) are bronchodilators but require expert dosing

   - Vagus nerve stimulates secretions
   - Accounts for ~30% of secretion

2. **Gastric Phase:**
   - Food in stomach
   - Triggered by distension and chemical stimuli (peptides)
   - **Gastrin Release:** Stimulates HCl and pepsinogen secretion
   - Accounts for ~60% of secretion

3. **Intestinal Phase:**
   - Food enters small intestine
   - Initially stimulates gastric secretion (brief)
   - Then **inhibits** via hormones (secretin, CCK) and neural reflexes
   - Slows gastric emptying (allows time for intestinal digestion)

**Stomach Motility:**

**Mixing Waves:**

### Urine Formation

Three processes

#### Glomerular Filtration

Passive process; forces plasma through filtration membrane

**Driving Force:** Glomerular blood pressure

**Pressures Involved:**

**Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure (GHP):** ~55 mmHg
- Blood pressure in glomerulus (pushing fluid out)

**Opposing Pressures:**
- **Capsular Hydrostatic Pressure (CHP):** ~15 mmHg (fluid in capsular space)
- **Blood Colloid Osmotic Pressure (BCOP):** ~30 mmHg (proteins in blood pull water back)

**Net Filtration Pressure (NFP):**
- NFP = GHP - (CHP + BCOP)
- NFP = 55 - (15 + 30) = 10 mmHg
- Net outward pressure drives filtration

**Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):**
- Volume of filtrate formed per minute
- Normal: ~125 mL/min (180 L/day)
- 99% reabsorbed → ~1.5 L urine/day

**Factors Affecting GFR:**

**Intrinsic Controls (Renal Autoregulation):**
- Maintain constant GFR despite BP fluctuations (80-180 mmHg)
- **Myogenic Mechanism:** Smooth muscle in afferent arteriole responds to stretch
- **Tubuloglomerular Feedback:** Macula densa senses filtrate flow/composition

**Extrinsic Controls (Neural and Hormonal):**
- **Sympathetic Nervous System:** Constricts afferent arterioles (decreases GFR during stress)
- **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):** See below

#### Tubular Reabsorption

  - Low ADH: Less water reabsorbed, dilute urine
  - Secreted by posterior pituitary when body dehydrated

**Sodium Reabsorption:**
- 65% in PCT (obligatory)
- Variable amounts in DCT and collecting duct
- Regulated by **aldosterone** (adrenal hormone)
  - Increases Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion
  - Released when blood pressure low or Na+ low

#### Tubular Secretion

- Inner medulla: very hypertonic (~1200 mOsm)

**Process:**
1. Ascending limb actively transports NaCl out (impermeable to water) → dilute filtrate
2. NaCl accumulates in medulla → hypertonic
3. Descending limb permeable to water → water moves out → concentrated filtrate
4. Vasa recta (blood vessels) parallel loops, preserving gradient
5. Collecting duct passes through hypertonic medulla
   - With ADH: Water reabsorbed → concentrated urine
   - Without ADH: Little water reabsorbed → dilute urine

**Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):**
- Also called vasopressin
- Secreted by posterior pituitary
- **Stimuli for Release:**
  - High blood osmolarity (dehydration)
  - Low blood volume/pressure
  - Alcohol inhibits ADH (increases urine output)
- **Action:** Inserts aquaporins in collecting duct → increases water reabsorption

**Aldosterone:**
- Steroid hormone from adrenal cortex
- **Stimuli for Release:**
  - Low blood Na+
  - High blood K+
  - Angiotensin II (RAAS)
- **Action:** Increases Na+ reabsorption (and water follows), K+ secretion in DCT and collecting duct

**Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP):**
- Released by atrial cells when blood volume/pressure high
- **Actions:**
  - Inhibits Na+ reabsorption → more Na+ and water excreted
  - Dilates afferent arterioles, constricts efferent → increases GFR
  - Inhibits renin and aldosterone release
  - **Net Effect:** Decreases blood volume and pressure

### Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)

Hormonal cascade regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance

**Triggers:**
- Low blood pressure
- Low blood volume
- Low Na+ in filtrate
- Sympathetic stimulation

**Cascade:**

1. **Kidneys release renin** (from JG cells)
2. **Renin converts angiotensinogen → angiotensin I** (in blood)
3. **ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) converts angiotensin I → angiotensin II** (in lungs)
4. **Angiotensin II:**
   - **Vasoconstriction** (systemic) → increases blood pressure
   - Stimulates **aldosterone release** (adrenal cortex) → Na+ and water retention
   - Stimulates **ADH release** (posterior pituitary) → water retention
   - Stimulates **thirst** (hypothalamus)
   - Constricts efferent arteriole → maintains GFR

**Net Effect:** Increases blood volume and blood pressure

### Acid-Base Balance

Kidneys regulate blood pH (7.35-7.45) by secreting or reabsorbing H+ and HCO₃⁻

**Mechanisms:**

**Secretion of H+:**
- PCT, DCT, collecting duct
- Lowers blood acidity

**Reabsorption of HCO₃⁻:**
- Bicarbonate is a buffer (alkaline)
- Reabsorbed in PCT (90%), DCT, collecting duct

**Secretion of NH₃/NH₄+:**
- Ammonia (NH₃) produced from glutamine in PCT cells
- Combines with H+ → NH₄+ (ammonium)
- Excreted in urine
- Allows excretion of H+ without making urine too acidic

**Formation of Titratable Acids:**
- H+ binds to phosphate buffers in filtrate
- Excreted as H₂PO₄⁻

**Compensation for pH Imbalances:**

**Acidosis (pH <7.35):**
- Kidneys increase H+ secretion, HCO₃⁻ reabsorption
- Produces acidic urine (pH ~4.5-5.5)

**Alkalosis (pH >7.45):**
- Kidneys decrease H+ secretion, excrete HCO₃⁻
- Produces alkaline urine (pH ~8.0-8.5)

**Response Time:** Slower than respiratory system (hours to days) but more powerful

### Micturition (Urination)

**Ureters:**

   - Internal sphincter relaxes
4. **Urge to urinate** reaches consciousness
5. **Voluntary control:**
   - External sphincter relaxed (voluntary) → urination
