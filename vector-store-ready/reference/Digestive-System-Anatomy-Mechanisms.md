# Gastrointestinal Tract Anatomy

**Context:** The GI tract is a continuous tube (~9 meters long) from mouth to anus, responsible for nutrient digestion and absorption, immune surveillance, and hormone production. Understanding its anatomy is essential for targeted herbal therapy.

## Structural Organization {#gi-tract-structure}

### Four-Layer Wall Structure

All regions of the GI tract share a common four-layer architecture:

1. **Mucosa** (innermost layer)
   - **Epithelium**: Direct contact with luminal contents
     - Stratified squamous (mouth, esophagus, anus): Protection from mechanical stress
     - Simple columnar (stomach, intestines): Absorption and secretion
   - **Lamina propria**: Loose connective tissue containing blood/lymph vessels, GALT
   - **Muscularis mucosae**: Thin smooth muscle creating local folds

2. **Submucosa**
   - Dense connective tissue with larger blood/lymph vessels
   - **Submucosal (Meissner's) plexus**: Enteric nervous system controlling secretion and blood flow
   - Contains glands in esophagus and duodenum

3. **Muscularis Externa**
   - Two layers of smooth muscle (except mouth, pharynx, upper esophagus with skeletal muscle)
     - Inner circular layer: Constricts lumen
     - Outer longitudinal layer: Shortens tract
   - **Myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus**: Controls peristalsis and motility
   - Sphincters formed by thickened circular muscle

4. **Serosa/Adventitia** (outermost layer)
   - **Serosa**: Visceral peritoneum (intraperitoneal organs)
   - **Adventitia**: Connective tissue (retroperitoneal organs)

### Regional Anatomy

**Oral Cavity and Pharynx**

**Large Intestine (Colon)**
- Regions: Cecum, ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid colon, rectum, anal canal
- Length: ~1.5 m
- Functions:
  - Water and electrolyte absorption (1-2 L/day)
  - Microbial fermentation of fiber → short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs: butyrate, propionate, acetate)
  - Vitamin K and B vitamin synthesis by microbiota
  - Fecal formation and storage
- No villi; flat surface with crypts containing abundant goblet cells
- Slower transit time (12-48 hours) allows microbial fermentation

**Rectum and Anal Canal**
- Rectum: Temporary fecal storage
- Anal canal: 
  - Internal anal sphincter: Involuntary (smooth muscle)
  - External anal sphincter: Voluntary (skeletal muscle)
- Hemorrhoidal plexus: Vascular cushions; congestion → hemorrhoids

## Accessory Digestive Organs {#accessory-organs}

**Pancreas**

- Bile pigments: Bilirubin (from heme degradation)
- Electrolytes and water

**Gallbladder**
- Storage and concentration of bile (5-10× concentration)
- Contraction triggered by CCK (released when fat enters duodenum)
- Herbal relevance: Cholagogues stimulate bile flow; cholecystokinetics stimulate gallbladder contraction

## Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) {#galt}

**Context:** GALT comprises 70% of the immune system, containing more lymphocytes than spleen and lymph nodes combined. It provides immune surveillance while maintaining oral tolerance to food antigens and commensal bacteria.

**Components:**

**Composition:**
- **Dominant phyla**: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes (~90%)
- **Other phyla**: Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia
- Individual variation: Each person has unique microbial "fingerprint"
- Regional variation: Density increases distally (10³ bacteria/g in stomach → 10¹¹-10¹² bacteria/g in colon)

**Functions:**

# Digestive Physiology

## Digestion and Absorption {#digestion-absorption}

### Carbohydrate Digestion

| Location | Enzyme | Source | Substrates | Products |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| Mouth | Salivary amylase | Salivary glands | Starch, glycogen | Maltose, maltotriose, dextrins |
| Small intestine | Pancreatic amylase | Pancreas | Starch, glycogen | Maltose, maltotriose, dextrins |
| Brush border | Maltase | Enterocytes | Maltose | Glucose |
| Brush border | Sucrase | Enterocytes | Sucrose | Glucose + fructose |
| Brush border | Lactase | Enterocytes | Lactose | Glucose + galactose |

**Absorption:**
- **Glucose and galactose**: SGLT1 (Na+-dependent co-transport)
- **Fructose**: GLUT5 (facilitated diffusion)
- All monosaccharides exit to blood via GLUT2 on basolateral membrane

### Protein Digestion

| Location | Enzyme | Source | Substrates | Products |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| Stomach | Pepsin | Chief cells (pepsinogen activated by HCl) | Proteins | Polypeptides |
| Small intestine | Trypsin | Pancreas (trypsinogen activated by enterokinase) | Proteins, polypeptides | Smaller polypeptides |
| Small intestine | Chymotrypsin | Pancreas | Proteins, polypeptides | Smaller polypeptides |
| Small intestine | Carboxypeptidase | Pancreas | Polypeptides | Amino acids |
| Brush border | Aminopeptidases | Enterocytes | Oligopeptides | Amino acids |
| Brush border | Dipeptidases | Enterocytes | Dipeptides | Amino acids |

**Absorption:**
- **Amino acids**: Multiple Na+-dependent co-transporters (specific for neutral, acidic, basic, imino acids)
- **Di- and tripeptides**: PepT1 (H+-dependent)
- Intracellular hydrolysis of di/tripeptides → amino acids to blood

### Lipid Digestion and Absorption

**Process:**
1. **Emulsification**: Bile salts break large fat droplets into smaller droplets (↑ surface area)
2. **Digestion**: 
   - **Pancreatic lipase** (with colipase): Triglycerides → 2-monoglycerides + 2 fatty acids
   - **Phospholipase A2**: Phospholipids → lysophospholipids + fatty acid
   - **Cholesterol esterase**: Cholesterol esters → cholesterol + fatty acid
3. **Micelle formation**: Bile salts form micelles containing:
   - Monoglycerides, fatty acids, cholesterol, lysophospholipids
   - Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
4. **Absorption**: Lipids diffuse from micelles into enterocytes
5. **Chylomicron formation**: Enterocytes resynthesize triglycerides, package with cholesterol, phospholipids, and apoB-48 → chylomicrons
6. **Lymphatic transport**: Chylomicrons too large for blood capillaries → enter lacteals (lymphatic vessels) → thoracic duct → bloodstream

**Bile Salt Recycling (Enterohepatic Circulation):**
- 95% of bile salts reabsorbed in terminal ileum
- Return to liver via portal blood
- Recycled 6-8 times per day
- Disruption (bile acid sequestrants, herbal fiber) → ↑ cholesterol excretion

## Gut Motility {#gut-motility}

**Types of Motility:**

1. **Peristalsis**: Sequential contraction and relaxation propelling contents forward
   - **Swallowing reflex**: Coordinated by swallowing center in medulla
   - **Gastric peristalsis**: Mixes food with gastric juice; propels to pylorus
   - **Intestinal peristalsis**: Controlled by myenteric plexus

2. **Segmentation**: Non-propulsive mixing contractions (predominant in small intestine)

3. **Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)**: 
   - Occurs during fasting (every 90-120 minutes)
   - "Housekeeping" function: Sweeps undigested material and bacteria toward colon
   - Disruption contributes to SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)
   - Stimulated by motilin

4. **Mass movements**: Strong peristaltic waves in colon (1-3 times/day) propel feces into rectum

5. **Defecation reflex**: Rectal distension → relaxation of internal anal sphincter (involuntary) + voluntary relaxation of external sphincter

**Regulation:**

*Intrinsic Control: Enteric Nervous System (ENS)*
- **"Second brain"**: 100 million neurons (more than spinal cord)
- **Myenteric plexus**: Controls motility
- **Submucosal plexus**: Controls secretion and blood flow
- Can function independently of CNS

*Extrinsic Control: Autonomic Nervous System*
- **Parasympathetic (vagus nerve, pelvic nerves)**: 
  - Stimulates motility and secretion
  - "Rest and digest"
- **Sympathetic (splanchnic nerves)**: 
  - Inhibits motility and secretion
  - Constricts blood vessels
  - "Fight or flight"

*Hormonal Control*
- **Gastrin**: Stimulates gastric motility and HCl secretion
- **CCK (cholecystokinin)**: Stimulates gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion; slows gastric emptying
- **Secretin**: Stimulates pancreatic bicarbonate secretion; inhibits gastric acid
- **Motilin**: Stimulates MMC
- **GLP-1**: Slows gastric emptying (incretin effect)

## Gut Barrier Function {#gut-barrier}

**Context:** The intestinal barrier must selectively allow nutrient absorption while preventing entry of pathogens, toxins, and undigested proteins. Barrier dysfunction ("leaky gut") contributes to systemic inflammation and disease.

**Components of Intestinal Barrier:**

1. **Mucus Layer**:
   - **Inner layer**: Firmly adherent, dense; devoid of bacteria
   - **Outer layer**: Loosely adherent; contains commensal bacteria
   - Mucins (MUC2 predominant) secreted by goblet cells
   - Protects epithelium from mechanical, chemical, microbial damage

2. **Epithelial Cell Layer**:
   - Single layer of tightly connected enterocytes
   - Rapid turnover (3-5 days): Stem cells in crypts → differentiation as cells migrate up villi
   - Antimicrobial peptides (defensins, lysozyme) secreted into lumen

3. **Tight Junctions**:
   - Seal between adjacent epithelial cells
   - Proteins: Occludin, claudins, ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3
   - Regulate paracellular permeability
   - Dynamic: Open/close in response to signals

4. **Immune Cells**:
   - Intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria immune cells
   - Rapid response to breaches in barrier

**Increased Intestinal Permeability ("Leaky Gut"):**

**Causes:**
- Dysbiosis and pathogenic bacteria
- Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ)
- Alcohol, NSAIDs
- Stress (corticotropin-releasing hormone)
- Gliadin (in genetically susceptible individuals)
- High-fat, high-sugar diet

**Consequences:**
- Translocation of LPS, bacterial fragments, food antigens
- Systemic immune activation and inflammation
- Conditions associated: IBD, celiac disease, food allergies, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, mood disorders

**Factors Supporting Barrier Integrity:**
- **Butyrate** (SCFA): Primary energy source for colonocytes; strengthens tight junctions
- **SCFAs**: Promote mucus production
- **Probiotics**: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species enhance barrier function
- **Zinc**: Essential for tight junction integrity
- **Glutamine**: Fuel for enterocytes; supports rapid turnover
- **Vitamin A**: Epithelial integrity and immune regulation
- **Polyphenols**: Anti-inflammatory; support tight junctions

## Gut-Brain Axis {#gut-brain-axis}

**Context:** Bidirectional communication between gut and brain via neural, hormonal, and immune pathways. Gut health profoundly affects mood, cognition, and behavior; conversely, stress affects gut function.

**Communication Pathways:**

1. **Neural**: Vagus nerve (80% afferent fibers carry information from gut to brain)
2. **Endocrine**: Gut hormones (CCK, GLP-1, ghrelin, PYY) affect appetite, mood, cognition
3. **Immune**: Cytokines from gut influence brain function
4. **Metabolic**: Microbial metabolites (SCFAs, tryptophan metabolites) affect CNS

**Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis:**
- Microbiota produce neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds
- Influence HPA axis (stress response)
- Affect blood-brain barrier permeability
- Modulate microglial activation (neuroinflammation)

**Clinical Relevance:**
- IBS strongly associated with anxiety and depression
- Probiotics ("psychobiotics") show promise for mood disorders
- Stress exacerbates GI symptoms
- Enteric infections can trigger IBS (post-infectious IBS)

**Cholagogues-Cholecystokinetics:** Stimulate gallbladder contraction (overlap with cholagogues)

**Mechanisms:**
- Increase bile production and secretion
- Enhance phase I and phase II detoxification (see Hepatic-Renal-Detox-Mechanisms.md for mechanisms)
- Hepatoprotective (prevent liver damage)
- Improve fat digestion
- Support cholesterol metabolism

**Clinical Applications:**
- Hepatic insufficiency
- Fat maldigestion
- Gallbladder dysfunction (without stones)
- Constipation (bile stimulates peristalsis)
- Metabolic syndrome
- Skin conditions (support elimination)

**Key Hepatic/Cholagogue Herbs:**

| Herb | Latin Name | Primary Action | Active Constituents |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Milk Thistle | *Silybum marianum* | Hepatoprotective | Silymarin (flavonolignans) |
| Dandelion Root | *Taraxacum officinale* | Cholagogue, bitter | Sesquiterpene lactones, inulin |
| Artichoke | *Cynara scolymus* | Cholagogue, hepatoprotective | Cynarin, chlorogenic acid |
| Turmeric | *Curcuma longa* | Cholagogue, anti-inflammatory | Curcumin |
| Bupleurum | *Bupleurum chinense* | Hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory | Saikosaponins |
| Schisandra | *Schisandra chinensis* | Hepatoprotective, adaptogenic | Lignans (schisandrin) |

**Contraindications:**
- **Bile duct obstruction or gallstones**: Avoid strong cholagogues (risk of biliary colic)
- Pregnancy (some herbs)

## Laxatives {#laxatives}

**Types of Laxatives:**

1. **Bulk-Forming Laxatives**:
   - Mechanism: Indigestible fiber absorbs water → increased stool volume → stimulates peristalsis
   - Examples: Psyllium (*Plantago psyllium*), flaxseed, chia seed
   - Onset: 12-72 hours
   - Safest for long-term use
   - Must take with adequate water

2. **Osmotic Laxatives**:
   - Mechanism: Draw water into intestinal lumen → soften stool
   - Examples: Magnesium salts, lactulose
   - Onset: 30 minutes - 6 hours

3. **Stimulant Laxatives (Anthraquinone Laxatives)**:
   - Mechanism: Stimulate colonic motility; increase intestinal secretion
   - Examples: Senna (*Senna alexandrina*), cascara (*Rhamnus purshiana*), aloe (*Aloe vera* latex)
   - Active constituents: Anthraquinone glycosides (sennosides)
   - Onset: 6-12 hours
   - **Caution**: 
     - Dependence with chronic use (colonic atony)
     - Melanosis coli (harmless pigmentation)
     - Contraindicated in pregnancy, intestinal obstruction, IBD
     - Use short-term only (≤2 weeks)

4. **Lubricant Laxatives**:
   - Mechanism: Coat stool and intestinal wall
   - Example: Mineral oil (not herbal; not recommended due to aspiration risk and nutrient interference)

**Herbal Approach to Constipation:**
- **First-line**: Bulk-forming laxatives + adequate water + dietary fiber
- **Supportive**: Bitters (stimulate peristalsis), magnesium, probiotics
- **Short-term rescue**: Stimulant laxatives (senna, cascara)
- **Address underlying causes**: Hypothyroidism, medications, dysbiosis, pelvic floor dysfunction

## Antimicrobials for GI Infections and Dysbiosis {#antimicrobials}

**Berberine-Containing Herbs:**
- Examples: Goldenseal (*Hydrastis canadensis*), barberry (*Berberis vulgaris*), Oregon grape (*Mahonia aquifolium*), coptis (*Coptis chinensis*)
- Mechanism:
  - Disrupts bacterial cell membranes
  - Inhibits bacterial DNA and protein synthesis
  - Anti-parasitic (Giardia, Entamoeba)
  - Modulates gut microbiota
- Clinical use: Acute diarrhea, SIBO, parasitic infections, dysbiosis
- Additional benefits: Hypoglycemic (AMPK activation), hypolipidemic

**Allium Species:**
- Garlic (*Allium sativum*): Broad-spectrum antimicrobial; prebiotic (inulin)
- Mechanism: Allicin and sulfur compounds
- Clinical use: Dysbiosis, Candida overgrowth, H. pylori

**Essential Oil-Containing Herbs:**
- Oregano (*Origanum vulgare*): Carvacrol and thymol; potent antimicrobial
- Thyme (*Thymus vulgaris*): Thymol; antimicrobial, antifungal
- Pau d'Arco (*Tabebuia impetiginosa*): Lapachol; antifungal, anti-Candida

**Bitters with Antimicrobial Properties:**
- Wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*): Anti-parasitic (especially helminths)
- Andrographis (*Andrographis paniculata*): Antibacterial, antiviral

# Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Bitter Reflex Requires Taste**: Bitters must contact tongue receptors to trigger vagal reflex; capsules bypass this mechanism

2. **Demulcents Taken Separately**: High mucilage content may interfere with absorption of other herbs and medications

3. **Carminatives After Meals**: Take after eating to relieve bloating; bitters before meals to stimulate digestion

4. **Peppermint Paradox**: Excellent carminative and antispasmodic, but may worsen GERD by relaxing LES

5. **Stimulant Laxative Caution**: Reserve for short-term use; dependence develops with chronic use

6. **Microbiome Support**: Prebiotic fibers (inulin, FOS) feed beneficial bacteria; consider in all chronic digestive conditions

7. **Gut-Brain Connection**: Address psychological stress in functional GI disorders; nervines and adaptogens essential

8. **Hypochlorhydria Underdiagnosed**: Consider in elderly, PPI users, those with B12/iron deficiency; bitters therapeutic

9. **SIBO Consideration**: In refractory IBS, test for SIBO; antimicrobial herbs + prokinetics address underlying issue

10. **Individualize Fiber**: Some IBS patients worsen with high fiber (especially IBS-D); adjust based on response
