# Chinese Herbal Formulas: Treatment Principles and Composition Strategies – Wellness Playbook

*by Yifan Yang*

This playbook distills how traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses herbal formulas to treat clearly defined syndromes rather than just diseases or symptoms. It explains how to analyze a patient’s pattern, set a treatment principle, and then build a tailored formula using structured roles (chief, deputy, assistant, envoy), herb pairs and trios, and precise dosage strategies. Part I lays out the theory, treatment methods, dosage and administration; Part II applies these tools to 19 common syndromes and over 60 sub-syndromes, showing how to turn principles into concrete treatment plans.

> **Important:** This handbook summarizes a professional text meant for trained practitioners. It is **not** a self-treatment manual. Any use of Chinese herbal formulas should be supervised by a qualified clinician.

## Core Principles

* **Syndrome-based, not disease-based**

  * TCM formulas treat *syndromes*—patterns of signs, symptoms, tongue and pulse—rather than Western disease labels. The same Western disease may correspond to several TCM syndromes, and one syndrome can underlie many Western diagnoses. 

* **Ben and Biao (root and manifestation)**

  * Every case is analyzed in terms of **Ben** (root/cause) and **Biao** (manifestation/surface expression). Treatment usually targets the Ben while also managing the Biao, with the emphasis shifting as the syndrome evolves. 

* **Dynamic treatment principle**

  * The **treatment principle** is the bridge from diagnosis to formula. As the syndrome changes, the principle must also change (e.g., from “descend Liver-Yang and extinguish wind” to “soothe Liver-Qi and strengthen Spleen-Qi” once the acute pattern resolves). 

* **Structured formula design (Chief–Deputy–Assistant–Envoy)**

  * A formula is not just “a pile of herbs”; it is a **structured team**:

    * **Chief (Zhu/Jun):** directly treats the *principal* syndrome and main symptoms; usually has the largest dose and enters the primary affected meridians.
    * **Deputy (Fu/Chen):** strengthens the chief against the main syndrome and/or directly treats a coexisting syndrome.
    * **Assistant (Zuo):** enhances chief/deputy, treats secondary symptoms, reduces toxicity/harshness, or provides a strategically “opposite” movement when needed in complex conditions.
    * **Envoy (Shi):** guides actions to specific meridians/regions and harmonizes the temperature, direction, and strength of the entire formula. 

* **Herb pairs and trios as building blocks**

  * The book emphasizes **herb pairs and trios** as “working units” that give precision and flexibility; formulas are assembled by combining these units into the chief–deputy–assistant–envoy structure. 

* **Common combination relationships**

  * Herb interactions include mutual accentuation, enhancement, counteraction, suppression, antagonism, incompatibility, and single-effect use. Knowing these determines safety and synergy in formulas. 

* **Treatment methods & strategies first, specific formulas second**

  * The central skills are: identifying the syndrome, choosing a **treatment method** (e.g., induce sweating, clear heat, tonify, move blood) and a **strategy** (e.g., indirect tonification, protecting Spleen, harmonizing Ying and Wei). Classical formulas serve as examples, not recipes to copy blindly.

* **Dosage and administration are integral to treatment**

  * Correct dosage, preparation form (decoction, pill, powder, syrup, etc.), timing, and treatment duration are essential to efficacy and safety—not afterthoughts. The book devotes extensive discussion to adjusting dosage per syndrome, constitution, age, season, and medical history.

* **Protecting Spleen and Kidney as long-term strategy**

  * Many strategies emphasize **protecting Spleen** (digestion/transport) and **tonifying Kidney** (root of Yin, Yang, and essence) to prevent recurrence and chronic decline, even while addressing acute patterns.

* **Clinical reality: complex, evolving patterns**

  * Real cases often involve multiple concurrent or sequential syndromes (e.g., Spleen-Qi deficiency with dampness, food accumulation, or Liver-Qi stagnation). Practitioners must combine strategies from different chapters and adapt formulas across the course of treatment.

## Practical Playbook

Each theme below summarizes **what to do**, **how to do it** conceptually, and **why it matters** physiologically according to the book’s TCM framework. Specific herb choices and exact prescriptions are left to qualified practitioners.

### Exterior Wind Syndromes (Wind-Cold, Wind-Heat)

**What to do**

* For **wind-cold**:

  * Stimulate Defensive-Qi (Wei-Qi) at the surface, expel wind and cold, open the pores, and restore Lung dispersing and descending.
* For **wind-heat**:

  * Release the exterior while **clearing heat**, protecting body fluids, and relieving sore throat, thirst, and other heat signs.

**How to do it**

* Base design (Wind-Cold):

  * Chief herbs that **release exterior wind-cold** and promote sweating without damaging fluids.
  * Deputies that relieve **headache, neck and back stiffness, body aches** by easing Bladder meridian obstruction.
  * Assistants that support Lung-Qi (for cough, nasal congestion) or address coexisting dampness (heaviness).
  * Envoys that guide to the Lung and superficial region.
* Base design (Wind-Heat):

  * Chief herbs that **vent wind-heat** from the exterior.
  * Deputies that **clear heat from Lung/upper burner**, address sore throat and cough.
  * Assistants that protect Yin/fluids and reduce toxicity or excessive pungent warmth.
  * Formulas are adjusted for dryness, dampness, or if the pathogen begins to move interior.

**Why it matters**

* Early, correct treatment prevents exterior pathogens (cold, heat, damp) from penetrating deeper, where they cause more serious internal heat, phlegm, or organ damage.

---

### Interior Heat Syndromes

*(Including Qi-level heat, Ying/Xue-level heat, organ-heat such as in Heart, Liver, Lung, Stomach/Intestine, and damp-heat patterns.)*

**What to do**

* Clear internal heat while protecting Qi, Yin, and blood, and address where the heat is located (Qi, Ying, Xue levels; specific organs; or damp-heat).

**How to do it**

* Identify level and location:

  * **Qi-level heat:** high fever, irritability, strong thirst, dry yellow tongue coat.
  * **Ying/Xue-level heat:** deeper symptoms like delirium, bleeding, rashes, Yin damage.
  * **Organ heat:** targeted signs in Heart, Liver, Lung, Stomach, Intestine, Kidney–Bladder, etc.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chief herbs that **clear the dominant heat type** (pure heat vs damp-heat; organ-specific vs systemic).
  * Deputies that **protect fluids/Yin**, move Qi/blood to prevent congealing of heat, or drain specific organs (e.g., Stomach/Intestine accumulation heat).
  * Assistants that regulate stool/urine (to vent heat), calm the mind if Heart-Shen is disturbed, or resolve phlegm.
  * Careful dosing to avoid damaging Spleen and Stomach.
* Progression:

  * If heat moves deeper or depletes Yin, shift from strong clearing to **combining clearing with tonifying/nourishing** (e.g., protect Yin or blood).

**Why it matters**

* Internal heat can quickly damage fluids, blood, and the Heart-Shen, causing agitation, bleeding, or collapse; precise targeting of level and organ reduces damage and speeds resolution.

---

### Interior Cold Syndromes 

**What to do**

* Warm the interior, disperse cold, restore normal Qi and blood movement, and support Yang without over-stimulating.

**How to do it**

* Identify whether the cold is:

  * **Pure cold** (from cold pathogen) or **Yang deficiency** (Kidney, Spleen, or both).
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **warm the core** (middle burner, Kidney) and disperse internal cold.
  * Deputies that move Qi/blood to relieve pain and stagnation caused by cold.
  * Assistants to protect Yin/fluids and prevent excessive dryness or heat from strong warm herbs.
  * Dose and duration carefully limited, especially in patients with existing Yin deficiency or heat signs.

**Why it matters**

* Interior cold slows metabolism and circulation, causing pain, impaired digestion, and long-term Yang depletion if untreated.

---

### Dampness & Phlegm Syndromes

**What to do**

* Transform phlegm, drain dampness and water, restore the Spleen’s transport function, and reopen blocked orifices and channels.

**How to do it**

* Distinguish:

  * **Dampness:** heaviness, edema, sticky stools, thick coat.
  * **Phlegm:** cough with phlegm, nodules, mental clouding, or internal obstruction.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **dry damp, transform phlegm, or promote urination** according to location (Lung, Spleen/Stomach, channels, orifices).
  * Deputies that **regulate Qi** to help move and expel damp and phlegm.
  * Assistants to protect Spleen and Stomach from over-drying and to manage secondary symptoms (e.g., cough, dizziness, palpitations).
  * Long-term emphasis on **strengthening Spleen** and sometimes Kidney to prevent recurrence.

**Why it matters**

* Damp and phlegm are central in chronic disease: they obstruct Qi and blood, cloud the mind, and create fertile ground for heat and stagnation.

---

### Qi Deficiency Syndromes (Spleen-Qi, Lung-Qi, Heart-Qi, etc.) 

**What to do**

* Tonify the deficient Qi (often Spleen, Lung, Heart), support overall vitality, and prevent further depletion.

**How to do it**

* Syndrome examples in the book include Spleen-Qi deficiency, Lung-Qi deficiency, and Heart-Qi deficiency.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **directly tonify the relevant organ’s Qi**.
  * Deputies that assist the main tonification and address secondary manifestations (e.g., dampness with Spleen-Qi deficiency, cough in Lung-Qi deficiency).
  * Assistants to regulate Qi and prevent stagnation from heavy tonics; some also protect digestion.
  * Strategies such as **indirect tonification** (treating pathogens or moving stagnation so that tonics are more effective) are emphasized. 

**Why it matters**

* Qi deficiency underlies fatigue, poor digestion, frequent illness, and can evolve into Yang deficiency or damp/phlegm accumulation if untreated.

---

### Blood Deficiency Syndromes (Liver-Blood, Heart-Blood)

**What to do**

* Nourish and tonify blood, support the Liver’s storage and Heart’s governing functions, and harmonize Qi and blood.

**How to do it**

* Common patterns include **Liver-blood deficiency** and **Heart-blood deficiency**.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **enrich and generate blood**.
  * Deputies that **tonify Qi** to support blood production or soothe Liver-Qi.
  * Assistants that regulate blood circulation and address secondary symptoms (e.g., dizziness, insomnia, numbness).
  * Often combined with **Yin tonification** when blood and Yin deficiency coexist.

**Why it matters**

* Blood deficiency affects menstruation, vision, tendons, sleep, and emotional stability; correcting it stabilizes both physical and mental health.

---

### Qi Stagnation Syndromes 

**What to do**

* Move and regulate Qi, relieve distension and pain, and prevent stagnation transforming into heat, blood stasis, or phlegm.

**How to do it**

* Examples: **Liver-Qi stagnation**, **Qi stagnation in Stomach, Spleen, Large Intestine**, and **Lung-Qi stagnation**.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **move the primary stagnant Qi** (often in Liver or digestive tract).
  * Deputies that target secondary locations (e.g., chest, epigastrium, intestines) or related emotions.
  * Assistants that transform phlegm/damp or regulate blood if these have become involved.
  * Strategies for Qi stagnation are discussed as a general method, to be adapted to organs. 

**Why it matters**

* Unresolved Qi stagnation is a frequent root of emotional distress, pain, digestive issues, and later blood stasis or heat.

---

### Blood Stagnation Syndromes 

**What to do**

* Invigorate and move blood, dispel stasis, relieve pain, and support generation of new healthy blood.

**How to do it**

* Blood stagnation appears in many contexts (trauma, chronic pain, gynecological issues, sequelae of heat or cold).
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **break or move blood stasis** at the key site.
  * Deputies that move Qi (to move blood), warm or cool as needed, and treat organ involvement (e.g., Liver, Heart, Uterus).
  * Assistants to stop bleeding if concurrent, relieve pain, and protect the Zheng-Qi (upright Qi).

**Why it matters**

* Blood stasis is associated with fixed, stabbing pain and chronic disease; resolving it is essential for long-term recovery.

---

### Yin Deficiency Syndromes (Liver-Yin, Kidney-Yin, Heart-Yin, etc.)

**What to do**

* Nourish Yin and fluids, anchor Yang, and clear deficiency heat without over-cooling or damaging digestion.

**How to do it**

* Examples include **Liver-Yin deficiency**, **Kidney-Yin deficiency**, and syndromes of **internal wind from Yin deficiency**.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **enrich Yin** of the relevant organ(s).
  * Deputies that **clear deficiency heat** and calm internal wind if present.
  * Assistants that support Spleen and digestion, or move blood to prevent cloying from rich Yin tonics.

**Why it matters**

* Yin deficiency leads to dryness, heat sensations, insomnia, and internal wind (tremors, dizziness), undermining long-term resilience.

---

### Yang Deficiency Syndromes (Spleen-Yang, Kidney-Yang, Heart-Yang, etc.)

**What to do**

* Warm and tonify Yang, restore functional activity of organs, and prevent collapse of Qi and Yang.

**How to do it**

* Patterns include **Spleen-Yang deficiency**, **Heart-Yang deficiency**, and **Kidney-Yang deficiency**.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **warm and tonify the deeper Yang** (often Kidney and Spleen).
  * Deputies that move Qi/blood and address water metabolism (edema, cold limbs, incontinence).
  * Assistants that protect Yin from over-warming and support digestion.
  * In **collapsing syndromes**, strong rescue Yang methods may be combined with strategies for locked-up/collapsing patterns (see below).

**Why it matters**

* Yang is the body’s active, warming force; its failure can lead to shock, organ failure, and loss of consciousness.

---

### Disharmony Syndromes (Qi–Blood, Yin–Yang, Ying–Wei, Organ Interactions)

This group includes syndromes of disharmony:

* Between **Liver and Spleen (Stomach and Large Intestine)**
* At the **Shao-Yang level**
* Between **Yin, Yang, Qi, and blood** of the internal organs
* Between **Ying-Qi (nutritive Qi) and Wei-Qi (defensive Qi)**

**What to do**

* Harmonize the interacting systems (organs, Qi and blood, Yin and Yang), resolving both excess and deficiency without overemphasizing one side.

**How to do it**

* General harmonizing strategy:

  * Chiefs from **two complementary groups of herbs** often share the role of “chief,” each acting on one aspect (e.g., one group soothing Liver-Qi, another strengthening Spleen-Qi). 
  * Deputies that fine-tune organ relationships or address associated heat/cold, dryness/dampness.
  * Assistants that regulate Qi and blood gently, protect digestion, and moderate any strong warming or cooling.
* Specific disharmony examples:

  * **Liver–Spleen disharmony:** soothe Liver, strengthen Spleen, regulate Qi and blood; used for digestive and emotional co-presentations.
  * **Ying–Wei disharmony:** harmonize nutritive and defensive Qi, often in recurrent exterior patterns and certain autoimmune-like presentations.
  * **Yin–Yang–Qi–Blood disharmony:** carefully rebalance without extreme tonification or reduction, often using harmonizing rather than purely tonifying or dispersing methods.

**Why it matters**

* Many chronic and mixed presentations are forms of disharmony; harmonizing prevents swinging between extremes and stabilizes the internal environment.

---

### Internal Wind, Locked-Up & Collapsing Syndromes

**What to do**

* For **internal wind** (often Liver-Wind): extinguish wind, anchor Yang, and address the root (e.g., Liver-Yang rising, heat, Yin deficiency).
* For **locked-up syndrome**: open orifices, move Qi and blood, clear heat or transform phlegm, depending on the type.
* For **collapsing syndrome**: urgently rescue Yang and Qi, secure fluids and blood, and stabilize vital functions.

**How to do it**

* Internal wind:

  * Chiefs that **extinguish wind** and calm the Liver.
  * Deputies that address underlying heat, blood deficiency, or Yin deficiency.
* Locked-up vs collapsing (book’s differentiation):

  * **Locked-up syndrome:** excess pattern with closed orifices, rigid limbs, locked jaw, no bowel/urine, wiry–slippery–forceful pulse.
  * **Collapsing syndrome:** deficiency pattern with loss of support of orifices, very deep and weak pulse, shallow breathing, cold limbs, profuse sweating, incontinence. 
* Formula strategies:

  * Locked-up: open orifices, transform phlegm, clear heat or warm cold according to type.
  * Collapsing: strongly support Yang and Qi while gently regulating Qi and blood; avoid harsh dispersing or strong sweating/purging.

**Why it matters**

* These patterns are acute and life-threatening. Correct differentiation between locked-up (excess) and collapsing (deficiency) is critical to avoid catastrophic mismatches in treatment.

---

### External Wind–Cold–Damp–Heat (Bi/Wei & Skin Disorders) 

**What to do**

* Expel wind, cold, damp, or heat from **skin, subcutaneous tissue, meridians, and collaterals**, relieving pain, weakness (Wei), and certain skin diseases.

**How to do it**

* Formula strategies (Chapter “Syndromes caused by external wind, damp, cold or heat”):

  * Chiefs that **expel the dominant external factor(s)** (wind, cold, damp, heat).
  * Deputies that unblock channels, relieve Bi pain (joint/muscle pain), or support Wei Qi.
  * Assistants to nourish blood or Yin when chronic obstruction has damaged them.
* Patterns often appear in:

  * **Bi syndrome:** painful obstruction of channels.
  * **Wei syndrome:** weakness/atrophy.
  * Chronic skin conditions where external wind/damp/heat lodge in the skin.

**Why it matters**

* These “surface” but chronic patterns can cause long-term disability; combining external expelling with internal harmonizing restores mobility and skin health.

---

### Dryness Syndromes

**What to do**

* Moisten dryness, nourish fluids and Yin, and protect the affected organs (often Lung, Stomach, Large Intestine).

**How to do it**

* Examples include **Lung dryness** and **Stomach/Large Intestine dryness**.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **moisten and nourish** the affected organ(s).
  * Deputies that clear associated heat or regulate Qi (e.g., constipation from dry intestines).
  * Assistants that protect Spleen, prevent stagnation, and manage secondary symptoms (cough, hoarseness, thirst).

**Why it matters**

* Dryness damages mucous membranes and fluids, impairing respiration, digestion, and elimination; correcting it often requires combining moistening with careful clearing or tonifying.

---

### Bleeding Syndromes 

**What to do**

* Stop bleeding, treat the underlying cause (heat, Qi deficiency, blood stasis, trauma, etc.), and preserve both Qi and blood.

**How to do it**

* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **directly stop bleeding** via appropriate mechanism (cooling blood, warming channels, consolidating).
  * Deputies that address underlying patterns (heat in blood, blood stasis, Qi deficiency failing to hold blood).
  * Assistants to move blood moderately (to prevent clotting) or tonify Qi and Yin.

**Why it matters**

* Bleeding is both a symptom and a cause of further deficiency; simultaneous control and root treatment prevent recurrence and deterioration.

---

### Heart-Shen (Mind) Disturbance Syndromes 

**What to do**

* Calm the Shen (Heart-spirit), clear heat or phlegm that disturb the mind, and nourish Heart-blood/Yin or tonify Heart-Qi/Yang as needed.

**How to do it**

* Patterns include **Heart-blood deficiency**, **Heart-Yin deficiency**, **Heart-Qi deficiency**, and **Heart-Shen disturbance** with phlegm or fire.
* Formula strategies:

  * Chiefs that **directly calm the mind** or clear Heart fire/phlegm.
  * Deputies that **nourish blood or Yin** or **tonify Qi/Yang** depending on the deficit.
  * Assistants that transform phlegm, regulate Qi, or harmonize Liver and Heart.

**Why it matters**

* Emotional and mental symptoms (insomnia, palpitations, anxiety, agitation) are closely linked to Heart and related organs; addressing their syndromes is central to holistic wellness.

---

### Using Formulas Across Disease Names

**What to do**

* Use syndrome patterns as the key to choosing and composing formulas; treat the *same syndrome* similarly even if Western disease labels differ.

**How to do it**

* Read “Associated disorders in western medicine” as **orientation only**, not as exact formula indications.
* For each case:

  1. Differentiate the TCM syndrome(s) (main + secondary).
  2. Choose treatment principles and methods based on the syndrome, not the disease name.
  3. Compose or adapt formulas accordingly.

**Why it matters**

* This preserves the flexibility and depth of TCM, avoids “one disease, one formula” thinking, and allows tailoring to individuals.

---

## Protocols & Checklists

### A. Formula Composition Protocol

1. **Syndrome differentiation**

   * Collect symptoms, tongue, and pulse.
   * Identify the **principal syndrome** and **secondary syndromes**.
2. **Set the treatment principle**

   * Decide what must change first (e.g., clear heat, release exterior, tonify Qi, move blood, harmonize organs).
   * Clarify Ben vs Biao and the sequence (which to treat first).
3. **Choose treatment method(s)**

   * E.g., induce sweating, clear heat, warm interior, harmonize, move Qi, move blood, reduce dampness/phlegm, tonify, stabilize/bind, calm the mind, extinguish wind, open orifices, moisten dryness. 
4. **Select chief herb(s)/herb group(s)**

   * Must directly address the principal syndrome and enter the main affected meridians.
5. **Select deputy herb(s)**

   * Reinforce the chief and/or treat important coexisting syndromes.
6. **Select assistant herb(s)**

   * Enhance chief/deputy, treat secondary symptoms, reduce toxicity/harshness, or provide strategic counter-movement where needed.
7. **Select envoy herb(s)**

   * Guide to specific regions/meridians; harmonize the overall formula’s temperature and direction.
8. **Adjust dosage and form**

   * Set relative dosages according to roles and syndrome severity.
   * Choose suitable form (decoction, pill, powder, etc.) and administration schedule.
9. **Monitor and modify**

   * Track changes in tongue, pulse, and symptoms.
   * Adjust treatment principle, methods, and formula structure as the syndrome evolves.

---

### B. Dosage Adjustment Checklist

When setting or modifying dosage:

* **By presenting syndrome**

  * Severity (mild vs acute/severe).
  * Acute vs chronic; excess vs deficiency.
* **During the course of treatment**

  * Reduce once the main pathogen is expelled or main syndrome improves.
  * Shift toward tonification and harmonizing when acute excess patterns resolve.
* **By constitution & diet**

  * Frail, elderly, or very sensitive patients: lighter dosages.
  * Robust patients with strong excess patterns: higher dosages may be needed short-term.
  * Consider diet that might aggravate or weaken the treatment (e.g., greasy, raw, cold foods).
* **By age**

  * Children generally require lower dosages and gentler herbs.
* **By season & climate**

  * Avoid over-warming in summer or hot climates; avoid strong cooling in winter or cold climates.
* **By life stage & medical history**

  * Special caution in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and serious chronic conditions; reduce or avoid harsh/toxic herbs.

---

### C. Administration Protocol

1. **Form selection**

   * Decoction, powder, pill, syrup, tea, extract, topical, etc., according to syndrome and patient needs.
2. **Taking the medicine**

   * Usually **warm**, not hot or cold.
   * Frequency and timing tailored to syndrome (e.g., before meals for digestive issues, before sleep for Shen-calming).
3. **Duration**

   * Short-term for acute external or excess patterns.
   * Longer, stepwise courses for deficiency and chronic disharmony, with periodic reassessment.

---

## Frameworks & Models

### 1. Chief–Deputy–Assistant–Envoy Formula Structure 

* **Chief (Jun/Zhu)** – principal action; largest share of dosage; enters main affected meridians.
* **Deputy (Chen/Fu)** – reinforces chief; treats coexisting syndromes.
* **Assistant (Zuo)** –

  * Enhances chief/deputy; treats secondary symptoms.
  * Reduces toxicity or harshness (corrective assistant).
  * Provides strategically opposing action/movement when necessary (strategic assistant).
* **Envoy (Shi)** – guides formula to specific region/meridians; harmonizes overall action.

---

### 2. Treatment Methods (What You “Do”) 

* Induce sweating
* Purge (drain downward)
* Induce vomiting (rare, specific indications)
* Harmonize
* Warm the interior
* Clear internal heat
* Reduce (disperse accumulations/excess)
* Regulate Qi
* Regulate blood
* Reduce dampness
* Eliminate phlegm
* Tonify
* Stabilize and bind (secure loss, prevent leakage)
* Calm the mind
* Extinguish wind
* Open the orifices and revive the Shen
* Moisten dryness

---

### 3. Treatment Strategies (How You “Apply” Methods) 

* Antagonistic treatment (targeting the primary pathogenic tendency directly).
* Following the symptoms while giving treatment (symptom-guided adjustments).
* Using “shortcuts” to quickly eliminate pathogens when appropriate.
* Indirect tonification (treat pathogens or unblock first, then tonify).
* Special emphasis on:

  * Protecting and strengthening the Spleen.
  * Tonifying the Kidney as the root.
  * Differentiating strong vs gentle tonification.
  * Strategies for:

    * Reducing interior excess heat.
    * Treating Qi stagnation.
    * Treating internal dampness and water.
    * Treating coexisting heat and cold.
    * Harmonizing Ying and Wei.
    * Balanced whole-body tonification.

---

### 4. Part I Conceptual Framework

* Types of herb combinations (accentuation, enhancement, counteraction, suppression, antagonism, incompatibility, single-effect).
* The process of formula composition (syndrome → treatment principle → formula structure → herb selection).
* Dosage principles (for single herbs and formulas).
* Preparations and administration methods.
* Treatment principles and their **sequence** (body–mind–environment integration; Ben/Biao; when to stop).

---

### 5. Part II Syndrome Framework

For each of the **19 main syndromes** (with >60 sub-syndromes), the book follows a consistent structure:

* Syndrome description (pathogenesis, key and secondary symptoms, tongue and pulse).
* Associated Western medicine disorders (for orientation only).
* Treatment principle and plan.
* Herb selection principles and composition strategies.
* Formula structure and selection of herbs by role (chief, deputy, assistant, envoy).
* Common accompanying symptoms and how to modify formulas.
* Examples of classical formulas analyzed by their strategies.

This framework is meant to train practitioners to construct **new, individualized formulas** rather than just memorize existing ones.

---

## Guardrails & Caveats

### Clinical Responsibility & Scope

* The author and publisher explicitly state that:

  * The material is for trained practitioners; they assume **no responsibility** for misuse.
  * It is up to the practitioner, using independent expertise and knowledge of the patient, to choose the best treatment and method.
* This handbook is a summary of those professional guidelines, **not a self-prescription manual**.

### Contraindications & Cautions in Herbal Use

* **Syndrome-related cautions**

  * Certain formulas or strategies are inappropriate in:

    * Wrong pattern (e.g., warming in true heat, strong purging in deficiency).
    * Severe deficiency, pregnancy, or very weak constitutions.
* **Dangerous/antagonistic combinations**

  * Some herb combinations are **dangerous or antagonistic** and must be avoided; the book details these in its contraindications section.
* **Dietary cautions**

  * Diet can aggravate syndromes or counteract formulas (e.g., greasy, cold, raw foods when Spleen is weak).
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding**

  * Special cautions apply; many harsh, moving, or toxic herbs are contraindicated.
* **Alongside Western drugs**

  * Specific cautions are discussed for combining formulas with antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants; potential interactions require careful monitoring.

### Toxic & Strong Herbs 

* The book flags **banned toxic herbs** (*) and **banned/protected substances** (**), but also stresses that:

  * Many **strongly acting herbs** are functionally “toxic” if misused or overdosed.
  * Practitioners must consider:

    * Correct indication (right syndrome).
    * Correct dosage and duration.
    * Patient’s organ function (especially liver, kidney, and heart).

### Dosage in Classical Formulas 

* Dosages listed in classical formulas:

  * Are taken from original texts, often using historical measurement systems.
  * Sometimes describe **large batch pharmacy preparations**, not single-patient prescriptions.
  * Should **not** be copied directly; practitioners are instructed to consult Part I dosage guidelines and Appendix I.

### Limitation of Disease Names 

* Western disease names in the text:

  * Serve only to help readers orient themselves.
  * Do **not** define exact indications for each formula.
  * Must never replace full syndrome differentiation.

## Key Terms & Concepts

* **Syndrome (Zheng):** A pattern of signs and symptoms reflecting a specific pathophysiological state in TCM; the main target of treatment.
* **Ben (Root) & Biao (Manifestation):** Root cause vs outward expression; essential for deciding treatment priority and sequence. 
* **Wei-Qi (Defensive Qi):** Qi that circulates at the surface, protecting against external pathogens; central in exterior syndromes. 
* **Ying-Qi (Nutritive Qi):** Deeper Qi that nourishes organs and tissues; its harmony with Wei-Qi is vital in certain disharmony syndromes. 
* **Qi Level / Ying Level / Xue Level:** Depth levels of internal heat in the warm-febrile disease framework.
* **Bi Syndrome:** Painful obstruction of meridians and joints due to wind, cold, damp, or heat. 
* **Wei Syndrome:** Weakness or atrophy of limbs, often due to lingering external or internal factors affecting Qi, blood, and fluids.
* **Locked-Up Syndrome:** Acute excess pattern with closed orifices and rigidity, often related to severe internal obstruction by heat, phlegm, or wind. 
* **Collapsing Syndrome:** Acute deficiency pattern with collapse of Yang and Qi, deep/weak pulse, and loss of support for orifices and organs. 
* **Herb Combination Relationships:** Mutual accentuation, mutual enhancement, mutual counteraction, mutual suppression, mutual antagonism, mutual incompatibility, and single-effect use; foundational to safe and effective formula design.

This handbook captures the **core logic** of *Chinese Herbal Formulas: Treatment Principles and Composition Strategies*: diagnose by syndrome, set a precise treatment principle, build a structured formula using herb pairs/trios and role-based composition, adjust dosage and methods over time, and always respect contraindications and patient-specific factors.
