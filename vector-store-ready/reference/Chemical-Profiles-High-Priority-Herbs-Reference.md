# Chemical Profiles – High-Priority Herbs

**Context:** This reference compiles concise chemical profiles for twenty high-priority herbs, emphasizing key bioactive constituents, representative molecular formulas, mechanisms of action, and high-level safety/interaction notes. It is optimized for use as a cross-herb chemical reference and to complement individual clinical monographs.

## Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*)

Ginger is a spice and medicinal plant made from the rhizome of a creeping perennial herb. Its characteristic warming flavour comes from phenolic ketones known as gingerols and shogaols.

- **Bioactive constituents / mechanisms –** Fresh ginger contains gingerols (6-, 8- and 10-gingerol) and related shogaols. (6)-Gingerol is a β-hydroxy ketone with anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties. It and its dehydrated derivative, 6-shogaol, inhibit COX-2 and 5-lipoxygenase, modulating NF-κB signalling and reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Other compounds such as zingerone and paradol contribute antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.
- **Bioactivity –** Anti-emetic (nausea/morning-sickness relief), digestive stimulant, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and potential anticancer effects.
- **Safety –** Generally considered safe at culinary doses; high doses may cause heartburn, mouth irritation or diarrhoea. Because ginger has mild antiplatelet activity, it could increase bleeding risk when taken with anticoagulants.
- **Interactions –** May potentiate bleeding risk with warfarin or aspirin and could lower blood pressure or blood glucose, so caution is advised with antihypertensive or antidiabetic drugs.

| Key compound (PubChem) | Empirical formula | Noted properties                                                          |

## Licorice Root (*Glycyrrhiza glabra*)

Licorice root (sweetwood) is used in confectionery and traditional medicine. PubChem notes that licorice root powder is derived from *Glycyrrhiza glabra* and widely used. Its sweetness is due to glycyrrhizin.

- **Bioactive constituents –** Triterpene saponins such as glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid), glycyrrhetinic acid (aglycone), flavonoids (liquiritin, isoliquiritigenin), chalcones (isoliquiritin), polysaccharides and coumarins.
- **Mechanisms –** Glycyrrhizin is metabolised to glycyrrhetinic acid, which inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, leading to cortisol retention and pseudoaldosteronism (sodium retention, hypertension). It also exhibits anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.
- **Bioactivity –** Anti-ulcer (increases mucus secretion), anti-inflammatory, antiviral (hepatitis), immunomodulatory, expectorant and sweetening agent.
- **Safety –** Excessive intake (>100 mg glycyrrhizin/day) can cause hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and arrhythmia due to mineralocorticoid effects. Contraindicated in pregnancy, hypertension and renal disease.
- **Interactions –** Potentiates corticosteroid effects; interacts with antihypertensives, diuretics and digoxin. May reduce testosterone levels and interact with oral contraceptives.
