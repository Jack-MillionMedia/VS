# The Earthwise Herbal Repertory – Wellness Playbook — Vector Store Edition

**DOCUMENT CONTEXT:** This playbook distills *The Earthwise Herbal Repertory* into a practical guide for using herbs through a traditional Western energetic lens, informed by homeopathic repertory methods. The book’s core thesis is that effective herbal care depends on understanding constitutions, tissue states, organ systems, and specific symptom patterns, then matching them with herbs whose energetics and organ affinities fit that picture. Rather than treating disease names alone, the repertory teaches you to see patterns in the body—heat and cold, tension and relaxation, dryness and dampness—and select herbs that rebalance those patterns over time.

**USAGE PRIORITY:** Defer to this masterfile when overlapping information appears elsewhere unless newer (post-2024) peer-reviewed data is explicitly cited.

### Core Principles

* **Treat patterns, not labels.**
  Disease names are less important than the overall pattern of symptoms, tissue qualities (hot/cold, dry/damp, tense/relaxed), and organ involvement; herbs are chosen to rebalance those patterns rather than to match a diagnosis title alone.

* **Three-legged stool: energetics, organ affinity, specific indications.**
  Effective prescribing rests on (1) the energetic/tissue state, (2) the organ or system most involved, and (3) specific indications—striking details that strongly point to a remedy.

* **Constitutions guide long-term tendencies.**
  People tend to fall ill according to their build and constitutional type: thin/“vata”-like, medium/“pitta”-like, or thick/“kapha”-like, each with characteristic vulnerabilities and disease patterns. 

* **Tissue states describe immediate imbalance.**
  Six tissue states—excitation, depression, atrophy, stagnation, tension, and relaxation—capture how tissues are functioning (overstimulated, exhausted, dried out, boggy, tight, or lax), and herbs are selected to shift the tissue back toward balance.

* **Holistic “complete symptom” is essential.**
  A “complete symptom” includes who is sick (constitution), what is wrong, where, with what accompanying symptoms, why, how it feels, and when it occurs or changes; this total picture is more reliable than any one symptom in isolation. 

* **Herbs work mostly by contraries; homeopathy by similars.**
  Herbalism mainly applies the “law of contraries” (treating heat with cooling herbs, dryness with moistening herbs, etc.), while homeopathy uses the “law of similars,” yet many herbs are used in similar ways in both traditions. 

* **Organ systems are “spheres of activity.”**
  Each plant has affinities for particular organs or systems (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, ECM, etc.), and disease often starts in, or is anchored by, a specific organ system that must be recognized and supported.

* **Taste and sensation are diagnostic tools.**
  The taste and immediate sensations of herbs (hot/spicy, bitter, sour, salty, aromatic, bland, sweet) reflect their energetic actions and help you quickly match herbs to tissue states and patterns. 

* **Grades of remedies reflect clinical frequency, not absolute strength.**
  High-grade herbs (printed in CAPITALS in the repertory) are those most frequently useful in practice; low-grade herbs can still be extremely valuable, especially in local or specialized traditions. 

* **Dosing ranges are flexible; “responsible dosage” must be individualized.**
  The repertory supports both very small and larger material doses; specific dose must be chosen case by case, with particular caution for herbs that change character in high vs low doses or that have toxicity concerns.

### Practical Playbook

#### Using This Herbal Repertory

**What to do**

* Start with the *main complaint*, then build a full, multi-dimensional symptom picture. 
* Use the repertory to cross-reference that picture under **tissue states**, **organs/systems**, **chronic or acute conditions**, and **specific actions** (e.g., diaphoretic, astringent, alterative).

**How to do it**

1. **Elicit the complete symptom.**

   * Who is sick? (constitution, age, sex, temperament).
   * What is wrong? (main complaint, diagnosis label if known).
   * Where is it located? (organ/region).
   * What else occurs with it? (associated symptoms).
   * Why did it start? (triggers, causes).
   * How is it experienced? (sensation, modalities, mental/emotional state).
   * When did it begin and how has it progressed? (onset, periodicity, sequence). 

2. **Identify key patterns.**

   * Is the person more thin, medium, or thick? Overheated, chilly, dry, damp, tense, or lax?
   * Which organ systems are most obviously involved (e.g., digestion vs lungs vs heart)?

3. **Look up relevant repertory sections.**

   * Start with **Energetics: Constitutions and Tissue States**.
   * Then consult **Organs and Systems** (e.g., Liver, Kidneys, Lungs).
   * For long-standing issues, consult **Chronic Conditions**; for short, intense issues, look at **Acute Conditions**.

4. **List possible herbs.**

   * Note high-grade herbs (in CAPITALS) first, then low-grade herbs that closely match the case. 

5. **Refine by specific indications and taste.**

   * Choose herbs whose “signature” details (e.g., type of pain, tongue or mucosa appearance, mental state) closely match the client.
   * Confirm or rule out candidates using the taste–tissue-state table.

6. **Construct a simple formula or single-herb trial.**

   * Combine one or more primary herbs with appropriate adjuvants, accelerators, or synergists, or start with a single herb with a strong fit.

7. **Monitor and adjust.**

   * Observe changes in tissue state, organ function, and overall vitality over time; adjust herbs, dose, or focus as the pattern shifts.

**Why it matters**

* This structured approach turns a large repertory into a practical tool and avoids random “kitchen sink” blends, instead aiming for precise matches that respect the whole person.

#### Constitutions & Tissue States

**What to do**

* Always distinguish between **constitutional tendencies** (vata, pitta, kapha / thin, medium, thick) and **current tissue state** (excited, depressed, atrophied, stagnant, tense, relaxed).

**How to do it**

* **Identify the constitution (dosha / somatotype).**

  * *Vata / ectomorph / nervous*: thin, dry, more easily anxious and depleted.
  * *Pitta / mesomorph / motive*: robust, medium build, prone to heat and inflammatory-type problems.
  * *Kapha / endomorph / vital*: thicker, well-nourished, purposeful, prone to dampness, weight gain, and stagnation.

* **Identify the current tissue state** (may or may not match constitution).

  * *Excitation/heat*: overstimulation, tendency to inflammation, redness, heat, fast pulse.
  * *Depression/cold*: under-functioning, low vitality, slow processes.
  * *Atrophy/dryness*: thin, dry tissues, lack of fluid and nourishment.
  * *Stagnation/dampness*: boggy, congested tissues, sluggish movement of fluids.
  * *Tension*: tight, constricted tissues; often associated with “wind.”
  * *Relaxation*: lax tissues with fluids leaking or flowing excessively (“damp flowing”).

* **Decide what you’re treating.**

  * Sometimes you treat the *constitution* directly (e.g., a chronically dry vata person).
  * Sometimes you treat a *superimposed pattern* (e.g., recent dryness in someone not normally dry). 

**Why it matters**

* Differentiating constitutional vs transient patterns prevents over-correcting a person’s innate type and lets you target what’s actually out of balance right now. 

#### Organs & Systems

**What to do**

* Map the complaint to one or more of roughly a dozen major “spheres of activity” such as ECM, respiration, circulation, digestion, assimilation, metabolism, elimination, locomotion, nervous system, endocrine, lymph/immune, and reproduction. 

**How to do it**

* **Identify primary organ/system involvement.**

  * For example: breathing issues → Lungs/Respiration; bloating and food intolerance → Stomach/Intestines/Assimilation; edema and blood-pressure issues → Heart, Kidneys, or ECM.

* **Look for organ compensation.**

  * An overworked organ may show signs of heat, inflammation, or hypertrophy; a failing organ may push other systems to compensate (e.g., kidneys and skin compensating for weak colon or liver). 

* **Consult the relevant repertory section.**

  * Each organ or system section lists herbs that support function, relieve congestion, or normalize activity (e.g., herbs for blood quality, pulse patterns, endocrine balance, or nervous system tone).

**Why it matters**

* Disease often begins or anchors in a weakened or overburdened organ system; organ-focused herbal strategies help address root imbalances rather than only surface symptoms.

#### Chronic Conditions & Life Stages

**What to do**

* Treat chronic conditions by addressing long-term tissue and organ imbalances and the accumulation of toxins or stagnation, with special attention to life stage (infancy, adulthood, pregnancy, aging).

**How to do it**

* **Recognize chronic patterns.**

  * Fatigue, exhaustion, long-standing digestive or metabolic issues, weight problems, environmental sensitivities, or degenerative changes usually reflect chronic disturbance.

* **Work with life stages.**

  * *Congenital weakness* and early-life vulnerability (sometimes framed as “jing deficiency”) call for gentle tonics to build core strength (e.g., herbs used traditionally for congenital weakness or to strengthen mother and baby). 
  * *Infants and children* may need remedies for colic, teething, bedwetting, fear, or developmental weakness, often in low doses and sometimes via the lactating mother. 
  * *Aging* is closely tied to blood stagnation and imbalances between blood and qi; herbs that improve circulation and resolve stagnation are central in later life. 

* **Address environmental and dietary toxins.**

  * “Toxins” are understood as incompletely metabolized substances and wastes that accumulate in the extracellular matrix due to poor elimination, gut permeability, impaired liver metabolism, low thyroid, microbial exotoxins, or sluggish clearance. 
  * Herbs called *alteratives* or “blood purifiers” support metabolic clearance and ECM cleansing and are often combined with laxatives to assist elimination. 

* **Work with weight patterns.**

  * Chronic obesity, central weight (“beer belly”), or underweight states are approached via herbs matched to the person’s pattern (e.g., herbs for loose tissues and metabolic sluggishness vs herbs for malnutrition and debility). 

**Why it matters**

* Chronic illness usually cannot be shifted by short, intense measures; instead it requires steady support of organs, tissues, and circulation tailored to life stage and underlying pattern. 

#### Acute Conditions & First Aid

**What to do**

* For acute, short-duration issues (fevers, infections, injuries, sudden flares), use herbs that match the acute tissue state and organ focus, often with more immediate actions (diaphoretic, astringent, antispasmodic, etc.).

**How to do it**

* **Classify the acute state.**

  * Is this primarily a hot, excited state (high fever, redness), a cold depressed state (chills, collapse), a damp congested state (boggy mucosa, catarrh), or a tense/spastic state?

* **Use organ-specific acute sections.**

  * The repertory indexes many acute conditions (e.g., fever types, infections, injuries, first-aid scenarios like chilblains, chickenpox, post-chemotherapy states) under relevant headings, cross-linking them to organ systems. 

* **Match actions to needs.**

  * For example, acute fevers may call for diaphoretic and cooling herbs; acute injuries may need vulnerary (wound-healing), anti-inflammatory, or circulatory support herbs; certain post-treatment side effects (e.g., after chemotherapy) are linked to stomach, kidneys, or cancer sections.

**Why it matters**

* Acute conditions are often where herbs can act quickly and visibly; orienting by tissue state and organ system avoids generic treatment and increases the chance of a clean, prompt response.

#### Formulation Strategy

**What to do**

* Build formulas around a primary indication, then add **adjuvants, accelerators, and synergists** that refine, speed, or deepen the main action.

**How to do it**

* **Primary remedy**

  * Choose 1–3 core herbs that best match the total symptom picture (tissue state, organ affinity, specific indications).

* **Adjuvants** (supporting herbs) 

  * Herbs that:

    * Help carry the action to a specific organ or tissue.
    * Soften extremes or balance an overly sharp remedy.
    * Address secondary but important aspects of the case.

* **Accelerators**

  * Herbs that increase the speed or intensity of a formula’s effect, often by stimulating circulation, nerve response, or excretion.

* **Synergists**

  * Herbs that harmonize the blend so that the combined action is greater and more integrated than the sum of individual effects.

* **Adjust over time**

  * As chronic patterns shift or acute symptoms resolve, remove no-longer-needed accelerators, adjust adjuvants, or simplify back to one or two key herbs.

**Why it matters**

* Thoughtful formulation prevents unnecessarily complex mixtures and allows clearer observation of what is actually helping, while respecting the layered nature of real human cases.

#### Taste-Guided Prescribing

**What to do**

* Use taste as a quick, practical indicator of a herb’s energetic action, especially when you do not know its full profile by memory. 

**How to do it (simplified taste–action logic)**

* **Hot / spicy / pungent**

  * Tend to warm, stimulate, and disperse; useful when there is coldness, stagnation, or internal accumulation that needs to be moved.

* **Bitter**

  * Typically cooling, drying, and draining; support liver, digestion, and reduction of excess heat or dampness.

* **Sour**

  * Astringent and condensing; often hold in fluids, tighten tissues, and can be useful in lax or overly relaxed tissue states.

* **Salty**

  * Soften hardness and can promote fluid movement, yet also relate to mineral balance and building of fluids.

* **Aromatic**

  * Light, dispersing, and often anti-microbial; open stagnation and “stuck” states in digestion and respiration.

* **Bland**

  * Mildly diuretic, drawing off excess fluid without strong stimulation.

* **Sweet**

  * Generally building and moistening, supporting deficiency and atrophy but potentially contributing to dampness if overused.

(These patterns are drawn directly from the repertory’s taste–tissue-state chart.) 

**Why it matters**

* Taste provides an immediate energetic “signature” that can confirm or challenge your herb choice and helps refine formulas for the person’s specific tissue state.

### Protocols & Checklists

#### Holistic Case-Taking (Complete Symptom Checklist)

Use this as a quick protocol when evaluating yourself or someone else:

1. **Quis (Who?)** – Note age, sex, build, temperament, and constitutional type (vata/pitta/kapha; thin/medium/thick).
2. **Quid (What?)** – Identify the main complaint and any known diagnosis; include both physical and mental-emotional features. 
3. **Ubi (Where?)** – Specify the location: organ, region, side, depth (skin vs deeper tissues).
4. **Quibus Auxiliis (By what aids?)** – Ask what has already been tried (herbs, drugs, diet, lifestyle) and what helps or harms.
5. **Cur (Why?)** – Explore apparent causes or triggers: injury, infection, stress, diet, weather, life events.
6. **Quomodo (How?)** – Describe the experience: sensations (burning, throbbing, aching, numb), modalities (better/worse from heat, cold, movement, rest), and mental state.
7. **Quando (When?)** – Time-course: onset, duration, recurrence, sequence of symptoms, times of day, seasons.

This “complete symptom” mirrors classical homeopathic methodology but is fully applicable to herbal practice. 

#### Basic Workflow for Using the Repertory

1. Collect the **complete symptom** using the checklist above.
2. Determine **constitution** and **tissue state(s)**.
3. Identify the main **organ/system** and any compensating organs. 
4. Look up the relevant entries under:

   * *Energetics (tissue states)*,
   * *Organs and Systems*,
   * *Chronic Conditions* or *Acute Conditions* as appropriate.
5. Note the list of herbs, prioritizing **high-grade** remedies and those whose specific indications and taste clearly fit the case.
6. Choose a single herb or simple formula; decide a starting **dose range** (minute/small/medium/large) within what is considered responsible for that herb. 
7. Observe effects over days to weeks (for chronic) or hours to days (for acute) and adjust herb choice, dose, or formula composition accordingly.

#### Building a Formula (Step-by-Step)

1. **Define the primary aim.**

   * Example aims: cool excessive heat, moisten atrophied tissues, move stagnant blood, calm tension, support exhausted adrenals.
2. **Select 1–3 primary herbs** that most closely match the aim and the organ/tissue needing support.
3. **Add adjuvants** to direct the action or support associated organs (e.g., adding a lymphatic herb when clearing ECM toxins).
4. **Include accelerators** if faster or stronger action is needed (e.g., herbs that stimulate circulation or nervous response).
5. **Add synergists** that harmonize and integrate the overall effect. 
6. **Adjust dose and ratio** between herbs according to sensitivity, age, and severity, staying within a responsible range. 

#### Simple Acute-Care Workflow

1. Decide whether the acute issue is **hot**, **cold**, **damp/stagnant**, or **tense/spastic** in character.
2. Identify the main **organ/system** affected (e.g., fever → systemic; sore throat → throat/upper respiratory; sprain → muscular-skeletal).
3. Use the **Acute Conditions** and **Organ/System** repertory sections to find herbs whose actions (diaphoretic, astringent, antispasmodic, vulnerary, etc.) match both tissue state and organ.
4. Choose short-term formulas or single herbs, typically at **small to medium doses**, and reassess frequently as the acute state shifts.

### Frameworks & Models

#### Ayurvedic / Somatotype Constitutions

* The book uses the **tridosha** model—*vata, pitta, kapha*—mapped to thin/medium/thick builds and corresponding Western somatotypes (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph).
* Each type has characteristic organ emphasis and stress patterns, suggesting where long-term strain and disease are likely to appear (e.g., nervous system in vata-like types, muscular and cardiovascular in pitta-like types, metabolic and endocrine/visceral in kapha-like types). 
* Some herbs act mostly on the **constitution**, others primarily on **acquired pathology**; the repertory notes this where tradition is clear. 

#### Six Tissue States

The six tissue states arise from an expanded view of the three-phase E-C-R cycle (excitation–contraction–relaxation) and are mapped to classic Greek qualities.

* **Excitation (Heat)** – Overstimulation, exaggerated function, tendency to inflammation (heat, redness, swelling, pain; carmine-red mucosa; rapid, high pulse; red tongue). 
* **Depression (Cold)** – Understimulation, lack of function, low energy; aligned with the quality of cold.
* **Atrophy (Dryness)** – Lack of fluid and nourishment; tissues thin and dry; mapped to dryness.
* **Stagnation (Dampness)** – Accumulation, congestion, sluggish flow of fluids; mapped to dampness.
* **Tension (Status strictus)** – Constriction, spasm, tightness; related to “wind” in TCM and “space/ether” in Ayurveda when lacking.
* **Relaxation (Status laxus)** – Lax, open tissues with fluids escaping or leaking (“damp flowing”), distinct from mere stagnation.

These states can be conceptualized in binary pairs: excitation/depression, atrophy/stagnation, tension/relaxation, or equivalently hot/cold, dry/damp, tense/relaxed.

#### Taste–Tissue-State Model

A key framework relates **herbal taste** to **tissue states and actions** (summarized here in plain language):

* Hot/spicy → warms, stimulates, disperses; moves from center out; counters cold, stagnation.
* Bitter → cools, dries, drains; supports liver and digestion; reduces excess heat/damp.
* Sour → astringes and condenses; firms lax tissues and helps hold fluids.
* Salty → softens hardness, influences fluids and minerals.
* Aromatic → light, dispersing, anti-microbial; moves stuck states in digestion and respiration.
* Bland → mild diuretic; helps draw off excess fluid.
* Sweet → building, nourishing, moistening; supports deficiency and atrophy but can contribute to dampness if overused. 

#### Organs & Spheres of Activity

The body is viewed as a set of overlapping **spheres of activity** (ECM, respiration, circulation, digestion, assimilation, metabolism, elimination, locomotion, nervous system, endocrine, lymph/immune, reproduction).

* Each sphere houses specific organs and characteristic patterns of disease.
* Herbs are cataloged according to which spheres they primarily influence, forming the basis of the organ/system sections in the repertory. 

#### Triphasic Stress & Adaptogens

Drawing on Hans Selye’s work, the book frames many disease processes as **triphasic**: initial attack, resistance, and recovery (with possible exhaustion).

* Many herbs across traditions have been used to mitigate the “rebound effect” of stress.
* Adaptogens are described as herbs that increase “nonspecific resistance” so that extreme reactions to stressors are reduced and the organism is less traumatized by them.

#### Symptom Totality & Ranking of Remedies

* The **totality of symptoms**—combining physical, mental, emotional, and circumstantial factors—determines remedy choice more reliably than any single symptom. 
* Remedies in the repertory are ranked by grade (high, low) according to frequency of usefulness in practice and in key reference texts; high-grade herbs are printed in CAPITALS. 

---

### Guardrails & Caveats

* **No built-in contraindication or interaction guide.**
  The repertory explicitly does *not* provide information on herbal contraindications, toxicities, drug interactions, or side effects; the author does not consider himself an expert in that area and directs readers to other sources for safety details. 

* **“Responsible dosage” must be researched per herb.**
  The book allows use of remedies in any responsible dosage but usually does not specify exact amounts; generally, minute ≈ 1 drop or less, small ≈ 1–10 drops, medium ≈ 10–25 drops, large ≈ 20–35 drops, with the author’s personal preference being 1–3 or 3–5 drops. These are offered as orientation, not rigid rules. 

* **Some herbs require small doses.**
  Certain herbs need small doses either to reduce toxicity or because they behave differently in small vs large amounts; dosing must account for these distinctions and may require further research beyond this book. 

* **Remedy grades are not absolute.**
  High-grade remedies are those most frequently observed in practice or in key texts, but many “low-grade” herbs may be high-grade in specific regions or traditions; grading reflects observed frequency, not intrinsic potency. 

* **Life-stage and congenital protocols are partly tentative.**
  Some recommendations for congenital weakness or specific life stages are acknowledged as tentative, even if supported by clinical observation; they should be approached with respect for that provisional status. 

* **“Detox” language is traditional and pattern-based.**
  Terms like “toxins,” “bad blood,” and “blood purifiers” reflect a historical and energetic understanding of incompletely metabolized wastes accumulating in the extracellular matrix; they do not correspond one-to-one with modern biochemical categories. 

---

### Key Terms & Concepts

* **Constitution (Dosha, Somatotype)** – A person’s inherent build and tendency pattern (thin/vata/ectomorph, medium/pitta/mesomorph, thick/kapha/endomorph) that shapes long-term vulnerabilities and stress points.

* **Tissue State** – One of six functional states (excitation, depression, atrophy, stagnation, tension, relaxation) reflecting how tissues are operating in relation to classical qualities (hot, cold, dry, damp, tense, relaxed).

* **Organ Affinity** – A herb’s tendency to act on a specific organ or system (e.g., liver, heart, ECM); a central organizing principle of the repertory.

* **Trophorestorative** – A term used historically for herbs that restore trophic (nutritive) function of a tissue or organ over time, associated here with organ affinity. 

* **Complete Symptom** – A fully described symptom that answers “Who, What, Where, With what, Why, How, and When,” providing a holistic picture for remedy selection. 

* **High-Grade Remedy** – A herb printed in CAPITALS in the repertory, indicating frequent usefulness across sources and clinical experience. 

* **Adjuvant** – A supporting herb added to a formula to direct the primary action, balance the formula, or address secondary aspects of the case. 

* **Accelerator** – A herb that increases the speed or strength of a formula’s action, often via stimulation of circulation, nerves, or elimination.

* **Synergist** – A herb that harmonizes a formula so the combined effect is more unified and effective than individual components alone. 

* **Alterative (“Blood Purifier”)** – A herb used to gradually improve metabolic clearance and resolve accumulations of waste products in the extracellular matrix (“bad blood” in older language). 

* **Adaptogen** – A herb that improves nonspecific resistance to stress, reducing extreme reactions to the rebound effect of stressors, based on Selye’s triphasic model.

This handbook is a compressed, practical map of the strategies and models presented in *The Earthwise Herbal Repertory*, structured for quick application while preserving the book’s core ideas and cautions.
