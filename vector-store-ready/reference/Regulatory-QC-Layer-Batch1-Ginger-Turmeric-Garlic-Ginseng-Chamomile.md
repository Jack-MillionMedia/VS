### 5.3 Posology ranges (non-product-specific)

_From WHO monograph and pharmacopoeial data; products may specify slightly different ranges._

- **Internal use (flowers)**

  - Adult daily dose of flower heads: approximately **2–8 g**, usually divided into several doses (e.g., tea infusions taken up to three times daily).
  - Fluid extract 1:1 (45% ethanol): **1–4 ml**, three times daily for adults.
  - Child doses are lower (e.g., around 2 g flower head three times daily) and typically avoided in children under 3 years without medical supervision.

- **External / topical use**
  - Compresses, rinses, gargles: typically **3–10%** infusion (about 30–100 g drug per litre of water) or corresponding fluid extract/tincture strengths.
  - Baths: around **5 g** drug per litre of water or equivalent alcoholic extract.
  - Vapour inhalation: about **6 g** drug or about **0.8 g** alcoholic extract per litre of hot water.

### 5.4 Pharmacopoeial identity & purity tests

**Identity**

- Plant part: dried flower heads of _Matricaria recutita_ L.
- Macroscopic: flower heads with hollow receptacle, white ligulate florets and yellow tubular disc florets.
- Microscopic: characteristic glandular structures and secretory canals; diagnostic pollen and trichomes.
- Chromatographic identity:
  - TLC/HPTLC and GC profiles demonstrating essential oil components (e.g., α-bisabolol, bisabolol oxides, chamazulene precursors) and flavonoids (e.g., apigenin glycosides).

**Purity and contaminants**

- Limits for foreign organic matter (e.g., extraneous stems and other plant parts).
- Ash values and moisture limits to control inorganic and water content.
- Minimum extractable matter.
- Microbiology: Salmonella negative; specified limits for aerobic count, fungi, enterobacteria and _E. coli_ depending on intended use (internal vs external).
- Pesticide residues and heavy-metals limits consistent with WHO quality-control guidance.

**Assay / markers**

- Essential oil content not less than a defined percentage (e.g., around 0.4% v/w or higher, depending on pharmacopoeia).
- Quantitative determination of apigenin or total flavonoids and/or α-bisabolol and related components in some pharmacopoeias and in ESCOP monographs.

### 5.5 GACP / GMP expectations (chamomile)

- **GACP**
  - Botanical verification to ensure use of _Matricaria recutita_ rather than other "chamomile" species with differing profiles and allergenicity.
  - Control of harvesting (time of day and flowering stage) to optimise essential-oil and flavonoid content.
  - Gentle drying at controlled temperatures to preserve essential oil and prevent decomposition of labile constituents and colour change.
- **Post-harvest**
  - Protection from strong light, heat and moisture; packing in odour-resistant, low-moisture materials.
  - Prevention of contamination with weeds, soil and other Asteraceae species.
- **GMP**
  - Defined specifications for flower cut size, essential-oil content and flavonoid markers.
  - For extracts, validated processes and specifications for active-marker content (e.g., apigenin glycosides, α-bisabolol).
  - Stability studies for bulk herb and extracts with monitoring of essential-oil and flavonoid content and microbial quality.
