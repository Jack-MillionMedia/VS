# The Practice of Traditional Western Herbalism – Wellness Playbook
*by Matthew Wood*

This handbook revives the principles of Traditional Western Herbalism, presenting a holistic framework for understanding health and disease. It teaches that the body is an intelligent, self-regulating system capable of healing itself when supported correctly. The core of this practice involves identifying energetic imbalances through diagnostic frameworks like the Six Tissue States and the Four Qualities, and then applying specific plant remedies to guide the body back to a state of balance and health.

## Core Principles

- **Holistic Healing vs. Management:** Traditional herbalism aims to *cure* the body by restoring its natural self-regulation (homeostasis). This contrasts with modern biomedicine, which often focuses on *managing* symptoms or fighting disease with external agents.
- **Energetics as a Diagnostic Language:** Health and illness are viewed as "energy patterns" or states of physiological function. A vocabulary of "energetics"—using terms like Hot, Cold, Damp, and Dry—provides a framework for describing and treating these patterns.
- **The Body as a Dynamic System:** The body is seen as a fountain of life, with an "inner fire" (metabolism) that radiates outward. Health is maintained by keeping this central fire strong and the channels of elimination (skin, kidneys, bowels) open. Disease arises when this flow is obstructed or weakened.
- **Specific Medicine for Specific Imbalances:** Each medicinal plant has a unique energetic signature that corresponds to a specific "wrong of life" or pathological state. The goal is to match the plant's signature to the person's specific imbalance for a targeted, curative effect.
- **The Law of Action and Reaction:** The body naturally strives for balance by reacting to stress with an opposite force. Healing can be achieved by supporting this process, either with remedies that provide an opposing quality (the "law of contraries") or that gently mimic the stress to stimulate a healing reaction (the "law of similars").
- **Direction of Healing:** True healing follows a predictable path: from the inside out, from the top down, from more vital to less vital organs, and with symptoms resolving in the reverse order of their appearance.

## Frameworks & Models

### The Four Qualities

This ancient system describes the fundamental energetic states of the body and of herbs. It defines qualities not by temperature but by their *effects*.

| Quality | Active Power & Effects | Pathological State (Symptoms) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hot** | Purifies, refines, and separates. Creates pores and rarefies tissues. | Red, swollen, tender, hot tissues; excessive function; rapid/superficial pulse; red, flame-like tongue. Associated with over-activity and intense self-expression (e.g., auto-immune responses). |
| **Cold** | Condenses, aggregates, and packs things together. A compressive power. | Cool, flaccid, pale or darkish tissues; inactive; diminished circulation and sensation; depressed functions; deep/slow pulse; dark, blue, or pale tongue. Weakens the body's innate identity. |
| **Damp** | A passive capacity for pliancy and being contained. It flows and collects. | Tissues are saggy, inelastic, with open pores and fluid discharge (Damp Flowing). Or, tissues are soggy, fluids are thick, and things are stuck (Damp Stagnation). Pulse is relaxed or obscure; tongue is damp or coated. |
| **Dry** | A passive capacity that sets boundaries and creates structure. It is not pliable. | Dryness, withering, weakness, and pallor from lack of fluids. Tissues are hardened and brittle; functions are reduced. Pulse is weak and tense; tongue is dry. |

Herbs are also classified by these qualities and are applied by "contrary" (e.g., a cold herb for a hot condition). Their intensity is graded in **four degrees**:
1.  **First Degree:** Mild action (e.g., opening pores, lessening sun heat).
2.  **Second Degree:** Moderate action (e.g., thinning or thickening fluids).
3.  **Third Degree:** Strong action (e.g., increasing internal metabolism, restraining fluid flow).
4.  **Fourth Degree:** Very strong, potentially caustic action (e.g., burning the skin, preventing "vapors" from rising).

### The Six Tissue States

This is the book's primary framework for diagnosis, mapping directly to physiological conditions. Each state represents a fundamental type of imbalance.

| Tissue State | Energetic Quality | Core Imbalance & Description | Key Symptoms | Corrective Herbal Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Excitation** | Heat | Over-exaggeration of normal function; inflammation. Tissues are red, full, and tender as blood increases cellular activity. | Temperature rise, restlessness, sharp pain, redness, swelling, pink-red and elongated tongue, rapid pulse. | **Sedatives** / **Refrigerants** (cooling, sour) |
| **Constriction**| Wind | Abnormal contraction or tension in the neuromuscular system. Inability to relax; stuck in a sympathetic (alert) state. | Spasms, rigidity, sudden or alternating symptoms (e.g., chills and fever), wiry/tense pulse, aggravation from cold. | **Relaxants** / **Antispasmodics** (acrid, bitter) |
| **Atrophy** | Dry | Lack of nutrition and function; a withered, underfed, weak condition. Tissues are dry due to a lack of water and oil. | Dry tongue (may be thin or cracked), dry/rough skin, nervous exhaustion, "hectic fever" (heat from lack of fluids). | **Nutritive Tonics** (moist, oily, salty, sweet) |
| **Depression** | Cold | Tissues are under-stimulated and incapable of responding. Lack of cellular oxidation leads to hypo-function and retention of waste. | Internal cold, cold hands/feet, tissue deterioration, darkish skin, deep/weak pulse, tendency to secondary infections. | **Stimulants** (aromatic, spicy, pungent) |
| **Relaxation** | Damp Flowing | Tissues are atonic, flaccid, and saggy; they cannot hold fluids, leading to continuous "free secretion." | Continuous loss of clear, watery fluids (saliva, mucus, sweat); prolapsed tissues; pale/cool skin; languid pulse. | **Astringents** (astringent) |
| **Stagnation** | Damp Stagnation / Torpor | Fluids collect inside tissues and thicken, impeding nutrition, metabolism, and elimination. "Bad blood" or "toxemia." | Swollen, flabby, apathetic tissues; "want of expression" in face/tongue; skin lesions; fatigue; thick, adhesive mucus. | **Alteratives** / **Blood Purifiers** (bitter) |

### The Three Primary Constitutions

This framework describes a person's underlying predispositions, based on which organ systems are dominant. It aligns with historical Western types and the Ayurvedic doshas.

| Type | Western Term | Ayurvedic Dosha | Embryonic Layer | Associated Systems & Organs | Physical & Psychological Traits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nervous** | Ectomorph | Vata | Ectoderm (Outer) | Nervous system, skin, senses | Thin, lean, dry. Active, restless, anxious, alert, sensitive, and intellectual. Prone to dryness and nervous exhaustion. |
| **Motive** | Mesomorph | Pitta | Mesoderm (Middle) | Muscular, skeletal, cardiovascular, renal systems | Medium, athletic build. Powerful, driven, confident, and action-oriented. Prone to heat, inflammation, and tension. |
| **Visceral** | Endomorph | Kapha | Endoderm (Inner) | Digestive, respiratory, lymphatic systems | Thicker, rounded build. Calm, easy-going, nurturing, and sensuous. Prone to fluid retention, stagnation, and sluggish metabolism. |

## Practical Playbook: Diagnosis & Treatment

### Assessing Your Condition
Use direct observation to identify the dominant tissue state(s). Pay attention to:
- **Tongue:** It is a graphic picture of the mucous membranes and internal state.
  - **Heat/Excitation:** Elongated, pointed, red or pink.
  - **Dryness/Atrophy:** Dry, possibly thin, narrow, or cracked.
  - **Relaxation/Stagnation:** Moist, possibly with foam; or flabby, atonic, with a thick, turbid coating.
- **Skin:** Note temperature, moisture, and color.
  - **Heat:** Red, hot to the touch.
  - **Cold:** Pale, dusky, cool to the touch.
  - **Dryness:** Rough, lacking oil or water.
  - **Dampness:** Moist, clammy, or boggy.
- **Symptoms:** Match your overall feeling and specific complaints to the descriptions in the Six Tissue States model. Are you feeling tense and constricted, or weak and relaxed? Are you running hot and irritated, or cold and depleted?

## Guardrails & Caveats

- **Herbs are Not Drugs:** Do not use herbs in a suppressive manner like modern drugs (e.g., using Goldenseal as a "natural antibiotic" to kill bacteria). The goal is to restore the body's own terrain and function, not to declare war on symptoms or microbes.
- **Dosage Matters:** Start with small doses. A specific remedy matched to the condition requires a much smaller dose than a general one. The book often recommends doses as small as 1-3 drops of a tincture.
- **Idiosyncratic Reactions:** People can react differently to herbs. For example, Valerian is relaxing for most but can be stimulating for some. Pay attention to your body's response.
- **Contradictions:** Be aware of specific warnings.
  - **Ginger** is contraindicated in conditions of high heat.
  - **Sage** is contraindicated during lactation as it dries up milk.
  - **Yarrow** should be used with caution in large doses during pregnancy.
  - **Catnip** should not be used for extended periods with small children due to a potential narcotic effect.
- **Toxicity:** Some plants have toxic parts. The berries of **True Solomon's Seal** are toxic; only the root is used. **Horse Chestnut** is moderately toxic and should only be used internally in very small material doses or homeopathic preparations.
- **This is a System of Patterns, Not Absolutes:** Nature has exceptions. An herb might not perfectly fit the models (e.g., Yarrow is a cooling stimulant). Use these frameworks as a guide for your intuition and observation, not as rigid dogma.

## Key Terms & Concepts

- **Alterative:** A remedy that alters the body's metabolism to restore health, often by cleansing the blood and improving elimination. Used for the *Torpor* state.
- **Astringent:** A remedy that contracts, tones, and firms tissues, reducing excessive fluid loss. Used for the *Relaxation* state.
- **Carminative:** An herb that relieves flatulence, soothes digestion, and warms the stomach. Often used in the *Depression* state.
- **Energetics:** The vocabulary used to describe the physiological patterns and functions in the body (e.g., hot, cold, damp, dry).
- **Humors:** A term from ancient medicine for the body's basic fluids. In this book, it often refers to thickened, stagnant fluids that impede function, associated with the *Torpor* state.
- **Refrigerant:** A cooling remedy that reduces heat and fever. A type of sedative.
- **Sedative:** In this context, a remedy that calms over-activity and reduces heat. Used for the *Excitation* state.
- **Specific:** A remedy that addresses a precise energetic imbalance, symptom-picture, or what the author calls a "wrong of life."
- **Stimulant:** A remedy that increases physiological activity, warmth, and circulation. Used for the *Depression* state.
- **Tonic:** A remedy that strengthens and builds tissue and function. Nutritive tonics are used for the *Atrophy* state.
