# Q42: Are there Herbs that Can Trigger Insomnia if Taken at the Wrong Time?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, several herbs can trigger insomnia if taken at the wrong time. Caffeine-containing herbs (coffee, green tea, yerba mate) taken within 4-6 hours of bedtime can cause insomnia. Stimulant adaptogens like rhodiola and ginseng can interfere with sleep if taken late in the day. The key is timing - take stimulating herbs in the morning/early afternoon, avoid evening use. Individual sensitivity varies - some people can tolerate afternoon use, others cannot.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Timing and Sleep

**Why Timing Matters:**
- Stimulants take time to wear off
- Effects can last hours
- Evening use interferes with sleep
- Individual sensitivity varies

**Half-Life Considerations:**
- Caffeine: 3-5 hours
- Adaptogens: Variable (some energizing effects last hours)
- Timing critical for sleep quality

Different herbs have different timing requirements.

**Risk:** 🔴 **HIGH - SIGNIFICANT SLEEP INTERFERENCE**

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Sleep Interference:** Grade A evidence - Multiple studies show caffeine disrupts sleep
- **Sleep Onset:** Grade A evidence - Delays sleep onset significantly
