# Q9: What Herb is Effective for Supporting Heart Health and Circulation?

**Quick Answer:** Hawthorn (*Crataegus spp.*) is the gold standard cardiovascular tonic (Grade B evidence), while hibiscus (*Hibiscus sabdariffa*) shows Grade A evidence for blood pressure reduction. Garlic (Grade A evidence) addresses multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The best approach combines these herbs with lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, stress management) for comprehensive cardiovascular support.

- **Cardiovascular Support:** Grade B evidence - Well-established benefits

**How It Works:**
- ACE inhibition
- Vasodilation (increases NO)
- Antioxidant
- Mild diuretic

**Dosing:**
- **Standardized extract:** 500-1000mg daily (oleuropein)
- **Timing:** Daily
