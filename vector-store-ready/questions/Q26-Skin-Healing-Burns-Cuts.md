# Q26: What Herbal Remedy Might Help Skin Healing After a Minor Burn or Cut?

**Quick Answer:** Aloe vera (*Aloe barbadensis*) is the most evidence-supported herb for minor burns (Grade A-B evidence), providing immediate cooling and promoting healing. Lavender essential oil (Grade B evidence) is excellent for burns - analgesic and antiseptic. Calendula (*Calendula officinalis*) promotes wound healing for cuts (Grade B evidence). Comfrey (*Symphytum officinale*) accelerates healing but must be PA-free and topical only. The key is proper application and knowing when to seek medical care.
