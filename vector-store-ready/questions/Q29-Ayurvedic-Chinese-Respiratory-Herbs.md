# Q29: How do Traditional Respiratory Herbs Differ Between Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine?

**Quick Answer:** Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine use different philosophical frameworks and herb selections for respiratory conditions. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes balancing doshas (constitutional types) and uses warming, pungent herbs like ginger, turmeric, and tulsi (holy basil). Chinese medicine focuses on balancing Qi (energy) and uses herbs like astragalus, licorice, and schisandra. Both systems are effective but approach respiratory health from different perspectives - Ayurveda emphasizes constitution and digestion, while TCM emphasizes energy flow and organ systems.
