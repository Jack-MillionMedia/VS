# Q14: What Herb is Effective for Balancing Hormones Naturally?

**Quick Answer:** Vitex (*Vitex agnus-castus*) is the most evidence-supported herb for hormonal balance, especially for PMS and menstrual irregularities (Grade A-B evidence). Black cohosh (*Actaea racemosa*) shows strong evidence for menopausal symptoms (Grade A evidence). Red clover (*Trifolium pratense*) provides phytoestrogens for menopausal support (Grade B evidence). The best choice depends on your specific hormonal issue - PMS/menstrual (vitex), menopause (black cohosh, red clover), or general support.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Hormonal Balance

**Hormonal balance** involves:
- Estrogen and progesterone balance
- Thyroid function
- Cortisol (stress hormones)
- Insulin sensitivity
- Sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone)

**Hormonal imbalances** can cause:
- PMS and menstrual irregularities
- Menopausal symptoms
- Mood swings
- Weight issues
- Fatigue
- Sleep problems

Different herbs target different hormonal systems.

- **Standardized extract:** 20-40mg daily (standardized to agnuside)
- **Tincture:** 2-4mL daily
- **Timing:** Morning (consistent daily timing important)
- **Duration:** 3-6 months for full effects (slow-acting)

**Timeline:** Improvement noticeable within 1-2 cycles (4-8 weeks); full effects after 3-6 months

**Important Considerations:**
- ✅ **Slow-acting** - Takes 3-6 months for full effects
