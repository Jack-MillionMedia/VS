# Q13: What Herb is Effective for Memory and Cognitive Support?

**Quick Answer:** Ginkgo biloba (Grade B+ evidence) is the most well-researched herb for memory and cognitive support, with benefits for age-related cognitive decline. Bacopa monnieri (Grade B evidence) shows strong evidence for memory enhancement and learning. Lion's Mane mushroom (Grade B evidence) supports cognitive function and may promote nerve growth. The best approach combines these herbs with lifestyle factors (sleep, exercise, nutrition) for optimal brain health.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Cognitive Health

**Cognitive function** involves:
- Memory (short-term, long-term, working memory)
- Learning and recall
- Attention and focus
- Processing speed
- Executive function

**Age-related cognitive decline** involves:
- Gradual memory loss
- Slower processing
- Reduced mental clarity
- May progress to dementia

Different herbs target different aspects of cognitive function.
