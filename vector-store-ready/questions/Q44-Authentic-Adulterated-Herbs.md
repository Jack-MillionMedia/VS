# Q44: How do I Differentiate Between Authentic and Adulterated Herbal Supplements?

**Quick Answer:** Differentiating authentic from adulterated herbal supplements requires multiple strategies: buy from reputable companies with third-party testing (USP, NSF, ConsumerLab certifications), check for standardization and proper labeling, avoid suspiciously cheap products, research the company's quality control practices, and be aware of common adulteration risks (turmeric with lead chromate, ginkgo with other species, St. John's Wort with other plants). The key is buying from trusted sources with verified quality control - price is often an indicator of quality.
