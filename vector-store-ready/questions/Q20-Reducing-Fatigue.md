# Q20: What Herb is Effective for Reducing Fatigue During the Day?

**Quick Answer:** Rhodiola (*Rhodiola rosea*) is the most evidence-supported herb for reducing fatigue (Grade A-B evidence), especially mental fatigue and fatigue related to stress. Ginseng (Grade B evidence) provides energy and reduces fatigue. Ashwagandha (Grade B evidence) addresses stress-related fatigue. The best choice depends on your fatigue type - mental fatigue (rhodiola), physical fatigue (ginseng), or stress-related fatigue (ashwagandha).
