# Q37: What are Common Signs of Herbal Supplement Overdose or Misuse?

**Quick Answer:** Signs of herbal overdose vary by herb but commonly include: gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), excessive sedation (from sleep herbs), liver toxicity (elevated enzymes, jaundice), allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), and cardiovascular effects (irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure). The key is recognizing when symptoms exceed normal effects and seeking medical care. Most herbs are safe at recommended doses, but overdose or misuse can cause serious harm.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Overdose vs. Normal Effects

**Normal Effects:**
- Mild, expected responses
- Improve with time
- Within expected range

**Overdose/Misuse:**
- Excessive, concerning symptoms
- Worsening over time
- Outside expected range
- May indicate toxicity

**Critical:** Know the difference between normal effects and overdose signs.
