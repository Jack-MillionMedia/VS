# Q12: What Herb is Effective for Improving Mood or Symptoms of Mild Depression?

**Quick Answer:** St. John's Wort (*Hypericum perforatum*) is the most evidence-supported herb for mild-moderate depression (Grade A evidence - comparable to SSRIs), while saffron (*Crocus sativus*) also shows strong evidence (Grade A). Rhodiola (Grade B evidence) helps with stress-related low mood. However, St. John's Wort has SIGNIFICANT drug interactions - absolutely contraindicated with SSRIs/SNRIs, warfarin, and many other medications. Always consult healthcare provider before use.
