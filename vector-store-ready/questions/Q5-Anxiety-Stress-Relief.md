# Q5: What Herb is Effective for Calming Anxiety and Stress?

**Quick Answer:** Chamomile (Grade B evidence) and lavender (Grade B evidence) are excellent for immediate anxiety relief, while ashwagandha (Grade B evidence) and holy basil (Grade B evidence) are best for chronic stress and building resilience. The best choice depends on whether you need immediate calm (nervines like chamomile, lavender) or long-term stress resilience (adaptogens like ashwagandha, holy basil).

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Stress vs. Anxiety

**Stress** = External pressure (work, deadlines, responsibilities)
- Usually eases when situation resolves
- Best herbs: Adaptogens (ashwagandha, holy basil, rhodiola)

**Anxiety** = Internal worry that persists without external threat
- Constant worry, racing thoughts
- Best herbs: Nervines (chamomile, lemon balm, lavender, passionflower)

Most people have both, requiring a combination approach.
