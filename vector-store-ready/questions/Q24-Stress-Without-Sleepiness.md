# Q24: Is there a herb that can help emotional stress without making me sleepy?

**Quick Answer:** Yes! Adaptogens are perfect for this - they help with stress WITHOUT causing drowsiness. Rhodiola (*Rhodiola rosea*) is energizing and reduces stress (Grade A-B evidence). Holy basil (*Ocimum sanctum*) provides stress relief with mild energizing effects (Grade B evidence). Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*) reduces stress without sedation (Grade B evidence). These herbs are ideal for daytime stress management when you need to stay alert.
