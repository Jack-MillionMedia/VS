# Q8: What Herb is Effective for Easing Respiratory Congestion or Coughing?

**Quick Answer:** Thyme (*Thymus vulgaris*) is highly effective for productive coughs and congestion (Grade B evidence), while mullein (*Verbascum thapsus*) soothes dry, irritated coughs (Grade B evidence). Elderberry (Grade B evidence) helps with underlying respiratory infections. The best choice depends on your cough type—productive/wet coughs need expectorants (thyme), while dry/irritated coughs need demulcents (mullein).

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Cough Types

**Productive/Wet Cough:**
- Mucus present
- Needs expectorants (help bring up mucus)
- Best herbs: Thyme, eucalyptus, elecampane

**Dry/Irritated Cough:**
- No mucus or minimal mucus
- Needs demulcents (soothe irritation)
- Best herbs: Mullein, marshmallow, licorice

**Post-Viral Cough:**
- Lingering cough after infection
- Needs antitussives + demulcents
- Best herbs: Wild cherry bark, mullein, marshmallow

Different herbs target different cough mechanisms.
