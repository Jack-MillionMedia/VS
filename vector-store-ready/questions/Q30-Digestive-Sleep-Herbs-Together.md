# Q30: Is it Safe to Take Digestive and Sleep Herbs Together?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, it is generally SAFE to take digestive and sleep herbs together, and many combinations are actually beneficial. Chamomile works for both digestion and sleep, making it an ideal combination herb. Ginger (digestive) + chamomile (sleep) is a safe and effective combination. However, avoid combining strong sedatives (valerian) with digestive stimulants right before bed, as this can cause conflicting effects. The key is timing and choosing compatible herbs.
