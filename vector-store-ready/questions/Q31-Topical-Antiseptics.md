# Q31: What Natural Plant Extracts are Used as Topical Antiseptics for Skin Infections?

**Quick Answer:** Tea tree oil (*Melaleuca alternifolia*) is the most evidence-supported natural antiseptic (Grade A-B evidence), effective against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. Lavender essential oil (Grade B evidence) provides antimicrobial and healing support. Thyme essential oil (Grade B evidence) has strong antimicrobial activity. Calendula (Grade B evidence) promotes healing with mild antimicrobial effects. The key is proper dilution and application - essential oils must be diluted, and these are for minor skin infections only.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Topical Antiseptics

**Antiseptics:**
- Kill or inhibit microorganisms on skin
- Prevent infection
- Promote healing
- Used for minor skin infections

**Natural vs. Synthetic:**
- Natural: Plant extracts (essential oils, herbs)
- Synthetic: Chemical antiseptics (alcohol, hydrogen peroxide)
- Both can be effective when used appropriately

Different plant extracts have different antimicrobial spectra.
