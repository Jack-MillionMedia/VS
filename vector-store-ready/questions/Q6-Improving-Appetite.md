# Q6: What Herb is Effective for Improving Appetite?

**Quick Answer:** Digestive bitters (gentian, dandelion root, artichoke) are the most effective herbs for improving appetite (Grade B evidence). They work by stimulating digestive secretions and activating the digestive reflex. Ginger (Grade B evidence) also supports appetite through digestive enhancement. The key is taking bitters 10-15 minutes BEFORE meals to trigger the digestive cascade.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Appetite Regulation

**Appetite** involves:
- Hunger signals from brain
- Digestive secretions (stomach acid, enzymes)
- Digestive reflex activation
- Taste and smell stimulation

**Poor appetite** can result from:
- Low digestive secretions
- Stress affecting digestion
- Medications suppressing appetite
- Illness or recovery
- Aging (reduced digestive function)

Different herbs target different aspects of appetite regulation.
