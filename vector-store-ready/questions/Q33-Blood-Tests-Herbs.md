# Q33: Can Herbs Affect the Results of Blood Tests or Medical Screenings?

**Quick Answer:** Yes, herbs CAN affect blood test results and medical screenings. St. John's Wort significantly affects liver function tests and drug levels. Bilberry can affect blood sugar tests. Some herbs affect thyroid function tests. The key is informing your healthcare provider about all herbs you're taking before blood tests, and some herbs may need to be stopped temporarily before certain tests. Always disclose herbal use to your healthcare provider.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Test Interference

**Types of Interference:**
- **Direct effects:** Herbs affect what's being measured
- **Indirect effects:** Herbs affect organ function (liver, thyroid, etc.)
- **Method interference:** Herbs interfere with test methodology
- **Drug level interference:** Herbs affect medication levels being tested

**Critical:** Always inform healthcare providers about herbal use before testing.

## Herbs That Affect Blood Tests

### 1. St. John's Wort (*Hypericum perforatum*) - Grade A Evidence

**Affects:**
- 🔴 **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)** - Can elevate ALT, AST
- 🔴 **Drug Levels** - Affects levels of many medications
- 🔴 **Hormone Tests** - Can affect hormone levels
- 🟡 **CBC** - Usually minimal effect

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Liver Enzymes:** Grade A evidence - Can cause elevation in LFTs
- **Drug Metabolism:** Grade A evidence - CYP450 induction affects drug levels
- **Hormone Tests:** Grade B evidence - Can affect hormone levels

**How It Works:**
- CYP450 enzyme induction (affects drug metabolism)
- May cause mild liver enzyme elevation (usually benign)
- Affects hormone metabolism

**CRITICAL:**
- 🔴 **Inform provider** - Always disclose St. John's Wort use
- 🔴 **May need to stop** - Before certain tests (discuss with provider)
- ⚠️ **Liver enzymes** - Elevation usually benign but can confuse interpretation

**Timeline:** Effects can last weeks after stopping (enzyme induction persists)

### 2. Bilberry (*Vaccinium myrtillus*) - Grade B Evidence

**Affects:**
- 🟡 **Blood Sugar Tests** - Can lower blood glucose
- 🟡 **HbA1c** - May affect long-term glucose markers

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Blood Glucose:** Grade B evidence - Can lower blood sugar
- **Diabetes Tests:** May affect glucose tolerance tests

**How It Works:**
- Anthocyanins improve insulin sensitivity
- Lowers blood glucose
- May affect glucose tolerance tests

**CRITICAL:**
- ⚠️ **Inform provider** - If having diabetes screening
- ⚠️ **May affect results** - Can lower blood sugar readings
- ✅ **Usually OK** - But inform provider

**Timeline:** Effects can last hours to days

---

### 3. Thyroid-Affecting Herbs - Grade B Evidence

**Herbs:** Ashwagandha (*Withania somnifera*), Bladderwrack (*Fucus vesiculosus*)

**Affects:**
- 🟡 **Thyroid Function Tests (TSH, T3, T4)** - Can affect levels
- 🟡 **TSH** - May lower or raise depending on herb

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Ashwagandha:** Grade B evidence - May affect thyroid function
- **Bladderwrack:** Grade B evidence - Contains iodine, affects thyroid

**How It Works:**
- Ashwagandha: May stimulate thyroid function
- Bladderwrack: High iodine content affects thyroid

**CRITICAL:**
- ⚠️ **Inform provider** - If having thyroid tests
- ⚠️ **May affect results** - Can alter TSH, T3, T4 levels
- ✅ **Usually OK** - But inform provider

**Timeline:** Effects can last days to weeks

---

### 4. Blood-Thinning Herbs - Grade B Evidence

**Herbs:** Ginkgo (*Ginkgo biloba*), Garlic (*Allium sativum*), Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*)

**Affects:**
- 🟡 **Bleeding Time** - May prolong bleeding time
- 🟡 **Platelet Function** - May affect platelet aggregation tests
- ✅ **INR/PT** - Usually minimal effect (except ginkgo)

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Ginkgo:** Grade B evidence - Can affect bleeding time
- **Garlic:** Grade B evidence - Mild effects on platelet function
- **Ginger:** ✅ NO EFFECT - High-quality human trial shows no effect on INR

**How It Works:**
- Antiplatelet effects (ginkgo, garlic)
- May prolong bleeding time
- Usually minimal effect on standard coagulation tests

**CRITICAL:**
- ⚠️ **Inform provider** - If having bleeding/clotting tests
- ✅ **Usually minimal effect** - But inform provider
- ✅ **Ginger safe** - No effect on INR (myth debunked)

**Timeline:** Effects can last days after stopping

### 5. Liver-Affecting Herbs - Grade B Evidence

**Herbs:** Milk Thistle (*Silybum marianum*), Turmeric (*Curcuma longa*)

**Affects:**
- 🟢 **Liver Function Tests** - Usually improve (lower enzymes)
- 🟢 **Usually beneficial** - Lower elevated enzymes

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Milk Thistle:** Grade B evidence - Usually improves LFTs
- **Turmeric:** Grade B evidence - May improve liver function

**How It Works:**
- Hepatoprotective (protect liver)
- Usually lower elevated liver enzymes
- Beneficial effects on liver function

**CRITICAL:**
- ✅ **Usually beneficial** - Lower elevated enzymes
- ⚠️ **Inform provider** - So they know why enzymes improved
- ✅ **Not harmful** - Beneficial effects

**Timeline:** Effects can last weeks
