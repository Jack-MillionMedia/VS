## Methods to Ensure Safety and Potency

### 1. Source Quality - Use High-Quality, Properly Identified Herbs

**Critical Steps:**
- ✅ **Buy from reputable suppliers** - Established companies with quality control
- ✅ **Verify identification** - Know exactly what herb you're using
- ✅ **Check for quality indicators** - Organic, third-party tested when possible
- ✅ **Avoid wild harvesting** - Unless you're expert at plant identification
- ✅ **Use correct plant parts** - Root vs. leaf vs. flower matters

**Quality Indicators:**
- **Organic certification** - Reduces pesticide contamination
- **Third-party testing** - USP, NSF verification
- **Reputable suppliers** - Established companies with quality control
- **Proper labeling** - Scientific name, plant part, origin

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- 🔴 **Unidentified herbs** - Don't know what you're using
- 🔴 **Poor quality suppliers** - No quality control
- 🔴 **Contaminated herbs** - Visible mold, pests, or off odors
- 🔴 **Wrong plant parts** - Using incorrect parts

**Evidence:** Studies show 30-50% of herbs may be misidentified or contaminated when not from reputable sources.

### 2. Proper Preparation - Correct Extraction Methods and Ratios

**For Tinctures (Alcohol Extractions):**
- **Ratio:** 1:5 (1 part herb to 5 parts alcohol) OR 1:10 for stronger
- **Alcohol strength:** 40-50% (80-100 proof) for most herbs
- **Extraction time:** 2-6 weeks (shake daily)
- **Straining:** Use fine mesh or cheesecloth
- **Storage:** Dark glass bottles, label with date and contents

**For Teas (Water Extractions):**
- **Ratio:** 1-2 tsp dried herb per cup water
- **Water temperature:** Boiling for roots/barks, just-boiled for leaves/flowers
- **Steeping time:** 5-15 minutes (covered to preserve volatile oils)
- **Fresh preparation:** Best used immediately

**For Infused Oils:**
- **Ratio:** 1:4 (1 part herb to 4 parts oil)
- **Oil type:** Olive, coconut, or other stable oils
- **Method:** Cold infusion (4-6 weeks) OR heat method (2-4 hours low heat)
- **Straining:** Fine mesh, squeeze out all oil
- **Storage:** Dark glass, cool place

**For Salves/Ointments:**
- **Base:** Beeswax + infused oil (typically 1:4 ratio wax to oil)
- **Herb preparation:** Use infused oil (see above)
- **Melting:** Low heat, don't overheat
- **Storage:** Dark glass jars, cool place

**Critical Preparation Principles:**
- ✅ **Follow established ratios** - Don't guess
- ✅ **Use correct solvents** - Alcohol for tinctures, water for teas
- ✅ **Proper timing** - Don't rush extraction
- ✅ **Clean equipment** - Sterilize when possible

- ✅ **Avoid contamination** - Keep away from pets, children, food prep areas
- ✅ **Hand hygiene** - Wash hands before handling herbs
- ✅ **Avoid cross-contamination** - Clean between different herbs

**Preventing Contamination:**
- ✅ **Use fresh herbs** - Don't use moldy or contaminated herbs
- ✅ **Proper storage** - Protect from moisture, pests
- ✅ **Check before use** - Inspect for mold, off odors, pests
- ✅ **Discard if contaminated** - Don't use questionable herbs

**Signs of Contamination:**
- 🔴 **Mold** - Visible mold growth
- 🔴 **Off odors** - Unusual smells
- 🔴 **Discoloration** - Unusual color changes
- 🔴 **Pests** - Insects or other pests

### 4. Dosage Accuracy - Precise Measurements and Standardization

**Measuring Equipment:**
- ✅ **Digital scale** - For accurate herb weights
- ✅ **Measuring cups/spoons** - For liquids and volumes
- ✅ **Graduated cylinders** - For precise liquid measurements
- ✅ **Consistent units** - Use metric (grams, milliliters) for accuracy

**Standardization Methods:**
- ✅ **Consistent ratios** - Always use same herb-to-solvent ratios
- ✅ **Document recipes** - Write down exact amounts and methods
- ✅ **Batch consistency** - Use same methods for each batch
- ✅ **Label clearly** - Include herb, ratio, date, dosage instructions

**Dosage Calculation:**
- **Tinctures:** Typically 1-4mL, 2-3 times daily (varies by herb)
- **Teas:** 1-2 cups, 2-3 times daily
- **Start low** - Begin with lower doses, increase gradually
- **Individual variation** - Adjust based on response

**Documentation:**

- **Light:** Store herbs in dark place
- **Shelf life:** 1-2 years (dried herbs), use immediately (prepared tea)

**Infused Oils:**
- **Container:** Dark glass bottles
- **Temperature:** Cool place (refrigerate if needed)
- **Light:** Store in dark place
- **Shelf life:** 6-12 months (check for rancidity)

**Salves/Ointments:**
- **Container:** Dark glass jars with tight lids
- **Temperature:** Cool place (may solidify)
- **Light:** Store in dark place
- **Shelf life:** 1-2 years (check for changes)

**Signs of Degradation:**
