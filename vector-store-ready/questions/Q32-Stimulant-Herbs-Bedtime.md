# Q32: Which Herbs are Stimulant-like and Should be Avoided Before Bedtime?

**Quick Answer:** Caffeine-containing herbs (coffee, green tea, black tea, yerba mate) should be avoided 4-6 hours before bedtime. Stimulant adaptogens like rhodiola and ginseng can interfere with sleep if taken late in the day. Ephedra (banned) is highly stimulating. The key is timing - take stimulating herbs in the morning/afternoon, avoid evening use. Individual sensitivity varies - some people can tolerate small amounts in evening, others cannot.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Stimulant Effects

**Stimulants:**
- Increase alertness and energy
- Can interfere with sleep
- Affect sleep onset and quality
- Individual sensitivity varies

**Timing Matters:**
- Morning/afternoon use: Usually fine
- Evening use: Can interfere with sleep
- Individual variation: Some more sensitive than others

Different herbs have different stimulant profiles.

## High-Risk Stimulants (Avoid Before Bed)

### 1. Caffeine-Containing Herbs - Grade A Evidence

**Herbs:** Coffee (*Coffea arabica*), Green Tea (*Camellia sinensis*), Black Tea, Yerba Mate (*Ilex paraguariensis*), Guarana (*Paullinia cupana*)

**Risk:** 🔴 **HIGH - SIGNIFICANT SLEEP INTERFERENCE**

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Sleep Interference:** Grade A evidence - Multiple studies show caffeine disrupts sleep
- **Sleep Onset:** Grade A evidence - Delays sleep onset significantly
- **Sleep Quality:** Grade A evidence - Reduces sleep quality
- **Half-life:** 3-5 hours (effects last hours)

**How It Works:**
- Blocks adenosine receptors (adenosine promotes sleep)
- Increases alertness
- Increases heart rate
- Can cause insomnia

**Dosing That Causes Problems:**
- **Evening consumption:** Any caffeine 4-6 hours before bed
- **Individual sensitivity:** Some people affected by even small amounts
- **Half-life:** Effects last 3-5 hours

**CRITICAL SAFETY:**
- 🔴 **Avoid 4-6 hours before bed** - Caffeine disrupts sleep
- ⚠️ **Individual variation** - Some people more sensitive
- ✅ **Morning/afternoon OK** - Usually fine if taken early
- ⚠️ **Decaf still has caffeine** - Small amounts may affect sensitive people

**Timeline:** Sleep interference if taken within 4-6 hours of bedtime

**Individual Variation:** Some people very sensitive (avoid all day), others can tolerate afternoon use.
