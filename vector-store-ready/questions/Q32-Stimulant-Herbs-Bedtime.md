# 🚫 Sleep Saboteurs: Herbs That Will Keep You Up All Night

**Tossing and turning despite doing "everything right"?** Your healthy herbal tea or afternoon supplement might be the culprit. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's relaxing. Some herbs are powerful stimulants that can wreck your sleep architecture if taken too late.

## ⚡ The Quick Answer
**Caffeine is the enemy.** Coffee, Green Tea, Black Tea, and Yerba Mate should be strictly avoided **6 hours before bed** (Grade A Evidence). Energizing adaptogens like **Rhodiola** and **Ginseng** are fantastic for morning energy but can be too stimulating for evening use.

> **The Golden Rule:** If it gives you energy, take it before 2 PM. If it relaxes you, take it after 6 PM.

## 🔍 The Deep Dive: The "No-Go" List

### 1. The Caffeine Crew (Avoid after 2 PM) ☕
*   **Coffee, Green Tea, Black Tea, Yerba Mate, Guarana.**
*   **The Science:** Caffeine has a "half-life" of about 5 hours. That means if you drink a coffee at 4 PM, half of that caffeine is still swimming in your bloodstream at 9 PM, blocking the "sleepy chemicals" (adenosine) in your brain.
*   **Sneaky Source:** **Guarana** is often found in "energy" supplements and has 2-4x the caffeine of coffee beans!

### 2. The Energizers (Avoid after 4 PM) 🚀
*   **Rhodiola Rosea & Panax Ginseng.**
*   **The Science:** These adaptogens increase alertness and mental focus. While they don't have the "crash" of caffeine, they can keep your brain in "work mode" when it should be winding down.

### 3. The Banned & Dangerous ☠️
*   **Ephedra (Ma Huang) & Yohimbe.**
*   **The Science:** These are potent central nervous system stimulants. They increase heart rate and blood pressure. Taking them before bed isn't just bad for sleep; it can be dangerous.

## ⚠️ Safety & "Need to Know"

*   **Individual Sensitivity:** Some people are "slow metabolizers" of caffeine. If you're one of them, you might need to cut caffeine by 12 PM or avoid it entirely.
*   **Decaf Trap:** Decaf coffee and tea still contain small amounts of caffeine. If you are super sensitive, stick to herbal teas like Peppermint or Rooibos.

> **💡 Clinical Pearl:** "Green Tea Extract" in weight loss supplements is highly concentrated caffeine. Read your labels!
