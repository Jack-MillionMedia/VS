# Q3: What Herb is Effective for Soothing Stomach Discomfort or Indigestion?

**Quick Answer:** Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) is the most evidence-supported herb for stomach discomfort and indigestion (Grade A evidence for nausea, Grade B for general digestive support). Peppermint (Grade A for IBS) and chamomile (Grade B) are also highly effective. The best choice depends on your specific symptom—ginger for nausea/upset stomach, peppermint for gas/bloating (unless you have GERD), chamomile for general digestive soothing.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Indigestion and Stomach Discomfort

**Indigestion** encompasses multiple symptoms:
- Nausea
- Bloating and gas
- Stomach pain or cramping
- Feeling too full after meals
- Heartburn (in some cases)
- Slow digestion

Different herbs target different aspects of digestive discomfort, making proper selection important.

## Top Recommendations Ranked by Evidence

### 1. Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) - Grade A Evidence

**Best For:** Nausea, motion sickness, indigestion, slow gastric emptying, general stomach upset

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Nausea:** Grade A evidence - Multiple systematic reviews confirm efficacy
- **Motion Sickness:** Grade A evidence - Superior to placebo in multiple RCTs
- **Pregnancy Nausea:** Grade B+ evidence - Significantly reduces nausea severity
- **Digestive Support:** Grade B evidence - Speeds gastric emptying, reduces indigestion

**How It Works:**
- Speeds gastric emptying (moves food through faster)
- Reduces nausea signals to brain (5-HT3 receptor antagonism)
- Anti-inflammatory for gut lining
- Stimulates digestive secretions
- Antimicrobial (helps with food poisoning)

**Dosing:**
- **Fresh ginger tea:** Slice 1-2 inches fresh root, simmer 10-15 minutes
- **Powder:** 250-1000mg as needed
- **Crystallized ginger:** Chew small pieces for nausea
- **Timing:** Before meals (for prevention) or as needed (for symptoms)

**Timeline:** Relief within 20-40 minutes

**Important Considerations:**
- ✅ **Extremely safe** - FDA GRAS status
- ✅ **Safe during pregnancy** for nausea
- ✅ **No interaction with warfarin** (myth debunked by high-quality human trial)
- ✅ **Works for multiple digestive issues**

**Individual Variation:** Works well for 70-80% of people.

### 2. Peppermint (*Mentha × piperita*) - Grade A Evidence for IBS

**Best For:** Gas, bloating, IBS symptoms, intestinal cramping

- **Gas and Bloating:** Grade B evidence - Carminative effects well-established
- **Digestive Cramping:** Grade B evidence - Antispasmodic effects

**How It Works:**
- Carminative (relaxes GI smooth muscle, allows gas release)
- Antispasmodic (reduces intestinal cramping)
- Volatile oils stimulate digestive secretions
- Relaxes lower esophageal sphincter (important: avoid if GERD)

**Dosing:**
- **Tea:** 1-2 teaspoons dried leaf per cup, steep 10 minutes
- **Enteric-coated capsules:** 0.2-0.4mL peppermint oil, 3x daily between meals (for IBS)
- **Timing:** After meals for gas/bloating; between meals for IBS

**Timeline:** Relief within 20-30 minutes

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:**
- ⚠️ **Avoid if you have GERD/heartburn** - Relaxes lower esophageal sphincter, can worsen reflux
