# Q43: Can Herbal Mouth Rinses Replace Conventional Toothpaste or Mouthwash?

**Quick Answer:** Herbal mouth rinses can be effective alternatives to conventional mouthwash (Grade A-B evidence for chamomile), but they should NOT completely replace conventional toothpaste. Chamomile mouthwash is superior to placebo and non-inferior to chlorhexidine for some metrics (Grade B evidence). However, conventional toothpaste provides fluoride (essential for cavity prevention) and mechanical cleaning that herbs cannot replace. The best approach is using herbal mouthwashes as adjuncts to conventional oral care, not replacements.
