# Q45: What Herbs are Used to Promote Healthy Skin Ageing and Elasticity?

**Quick Answer:** Gotu kola (*Centella asiatica*) is the most evidence-supported herb for skin elasticity and wound healing (Grade B evidence), while green tea (*Camellia sinensis*) provides powerful antioxidants that protect against UV damage and support collagen (Grade B evidence). Rosehip oil (Grade B-C evidence) contains vitamin C and essential fatty acids that support skin elasticity. The best approach combines internal antioxidants (green tea, astragalus) with topical applications (gotu kola, rosehip oil, aloe vera) for comprehensive anti-aging support.

## Detailed Evidence-Based Answer

### Understanding Skin Aging and Elasticity

**Skin aging** involves:
- **Collagen degradation** - Loss of structural protein that maintains skin firmness
- **Elastin breakdown** - Loss of elasticity and ability to "bounce back"
- **Oxidative stress** - Free radical damage from UV exposure, pollution, inflammation
- **Glycation** - Sugar molecules damaging collagen fibers
- **Decreased hydration** - Reduced ability to retain moisture

**Healthy skin aging** requires:
- **Collagen support** - Maintaining and stimulating collagen production
- **Antioxidant protection** - Neutralizing free radicals
- **Moisture retention** - Supporting skin barrier function
- **Inflammation reduction** - Minimizing chronic low-grade inflammation

Different herbs target different aspects of skin aging through multiple mechanisms.

## Top Recommendations Ranked by Evidence

### 1. Gotu Kola (*Centella asiatica*) - Grade B Evidence

**Best For:** Skin elasticity, wound healing, collagen synthesis, stretch marks, skin firmness

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Wound Healing:** Grade B evidence - Multiple RCTs show improved wound healing and scar reduction
- **Skin Elasticity:** Grade B evidence - Clinical studies demonstrate improved skin firmness and elasticity
- **Collagen Synthesis:** Grade B evidence - Stimulates collagen production (type I and III)

**Evidence Summary:**
- **Wound Healing:** Grade B evidence - Promotes tissue repair
- **Skin Hydration:** Grade B evidence - Improves moisture retention
- **Anti-Inflammatory:** Grade B evidence - Reduces skin inflammation

**How It Works:**
- **Polysaccharides:** Support skin barrier function
- **Antioxidants:** Reduce oxidative stress
- **Anti-inflammatory compounds:** Reduce inflammation
- **Moisturizing:** Improves skin hydration

**Dosing:**
- **Topical gel:** Apply fresh gel or commercial product, 2-3 times daily
