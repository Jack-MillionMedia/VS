## Main Topic

Selenium (Se, atomic number 34) is a trace element required in microgram amounts and incorporated as **selenocysteine** into at least 25 human selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases and selenoprotein P. These enzymes support antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis, reproduction and immune function. Plants absorb inorganic selenites/selenates from soil and convert them to organic forms (selenocysteine, selenomethionine), which humans efficiently absorb. About 28–46% of total body selenium is stored in skeletal muscle; the thyroid has the highest concentration due to deiodinase enzymes.

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Core roles**: Antioxidant defense (glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases), thyroid hormone activation (deiodinases), immune function, reproduction and fertility, and maintenance of muscle and cardiac function.
- **Intake**: Adult RDA is **55 µg/day**, with modestly higher needs in pregnancy (**60 µg/day**) and lactation (**70 µg/day**). The **UL is 400 µg/day** for adults (total from food + supplements).
- **Sources**: Highly variable by soil content; richest foods include **Brazil nuts**, seafood (yellowfin tuna, halibut, sardines, shrimp), organ meats, other meats and poultry, eggs, dairy, whole grains and legumes. Selenium is present in multivitamins and in single-ingredient supplements (selenate, selenite, selenomethionine, selenocysteine).
- **Deficiency**: Uncommon in North America but occurs where soil selenium is low or in patients with TPN without selenium, severe malabsorption, dialysis, or restrictive diets. Clinically associated with **Keshan disease** (dilated cardiomyopathy) and **Kashin–Beck disease** (osteochondropathy), as well as myopathy, immune dysfunction, infertility and thyroid abnormalities.
- **Toxicity**: Chronic intakes above the UL (typically >900 µg/day) cause **selenosis** (GI upset, fatigue, hair loss, brittle nails, dermatitis, neuropathy, garlic-like breath); severe overdose can cause multi-organ failure. Adults should avoid high-dose supplements except under medical supervision.
- **Clinical use**: Ensure adequate intake and correct deficiency; use in **parenteral nutrition** (≈60–100 µg/day) and in endemic regions to prevent Keshan disease (~50–200 µg/day). Current evidence does **not** support high-dose selenium supplements for cancer or chronic disease prevention.
- **Interactions**: Works synergistically with vitamin E; interacts with heavy metals (e.g., mercury) by forming complexes; high sulfur amino acid intake may reduce selenium absorption, while vitamin C can reduce some forms to less absorbable species.

## Recommended Intakes & Upper Limits

The Food and Nutrition Board has set **Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs)** for selenium to ensure full expression of selenoproteins and prevent deficiency.

| Age / physiologic state | RDA (mcg/day) – male | RDA (mcg/day) – female | Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL, mcg/day) |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Birth – 6 months**    | 15 mcg*              | 15 mcg*                | Not established                            |

## Dietary Sources

Selenium content in foods varies widely with soil selenium levels, fertilization practices and geographic region. In general:

- **High-selenium foods**:
  - Brazil nuts (≈544 µg per oz).  
  - Yellowfin tuna (~92 µg per 3 oz), halibut (~47 µg per 3 oz), sardines and other fish.  
  - Organ meats (liver).
- **Moderate sources**:
  - Seafood (shrimp, oysters).  
  - Meats (beef, turkey, chicken).  
  - Eggs (~15 µg each).  
  - Dairy products.  
  - Whole grains (e.g., brown rice 19 µg per cup, whole‑wheat bread ~10 µg per slice).  
  - Legumes (beans, lentils), sunflower and pumpkin seeds.
- **Plant foods**:
  - Mushrooms, oats, spinach and other vegetables; their selenium content is heavily soil-dependent.
- **Supplemental forms**:
  - Selenomethionine, selenite, selenate and selenocysteine are common forms in supplements; selenium is also included in many multivitamin/mineral products.

## Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism & Excretion (ADME)

- **Absorption**:
  - Organic forms (selenocysteine, selenomethionine) are absorbed in the small intestine via active and passive transport processes.  
  - Absorption efficiency is high (~80–95%) and relatively independent of selenium status.
- **Distribution**:
  - After absorption, selenium circulates mainly as **selenoprotein P** and albumin-bound selenomethionine.  
  - Highest tissue concentrations are in **muscle, liver, kidneys and thyroid**.
- **Metabolism**:
  - Selenomethionine can be nonspecifically incorporated into body proteins in place of methionine or converted to selenocysteine.  
  - Selenocysteine is specifically inserted co-translationally into selenoproteins via a unique UGA codon and specialized translational machinery.  
  - Key selenoproteins include glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases (antioxidant defense) and iodothyronine deiodinases (thyroid hormone activation/inactivation).
- **Excretion**:
  - Selenium homeostasis is governed mainly by **urinary excretion**.  
  - At high intakes, volatile metabolites such as **dimethyl selenide** can be exhaled, causing a garlic-like breath odor.  
  - Fecal excretion also increases with very high selenium intake.

## Physiological & Clinical Roles

- **Antioxidant defense**:
  - Glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases reduce peroxides and help maintain cellular redox balance, protecting lipids, proteins and DNA from oxidative damage.  
  - Selenium and vitamin E act synergistically in antioxidant systems.
- **Thyroid hormone metabolism**:
  - Deiodinase enzymes convert thyroxine (T₄) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T₃) and also help inactivate thyroid hormones.  
  - Adequate selenium supports normal basal metabolic rate and may help prevent thyroid disorders.
- **Immune function**:
  - Selenium supports the proliferation and function of T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and antibody production.
- **Reproduction**:
  - Selenoproteins participate in spermatogenesis and oocyte development; deficiency has been associated with impaired fertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
- **Other potential roles**:
  - Observational studies link selenium status to cardiovascular risk, cancer risk, cognitive decline, asthma and viral disease progression.  
  - Interventional trials have been **inconsistent**, so high-dose selenium supplementation **cannot be recommended** for prevention of these conditions at this time.

## Clinical Indications & Supplementation

- **Parenteral nutrition**:
  - Selenious acid injections (e.g., 40 mcg/mL) are used to provide selenium in TPN.  
  - Typical adult TPN doses are **60–100 mcg/day** to maintain plasma levels and prevent deficiency.
- **Deficiency treatment**:
  - Selenium deficiency is rare in developed countries but can occur in:
    - Regions with low soil selenium where diets rely on local produce.  
    - Patients on long‑term parenteral nutrition without selenium.  
    - Individuals with severe GI malabsorption (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel).  
    - Dialysis patients, those on restrictive metabolic diets (e.g., PKU formulas) and some with HIV infection or heavy metal exposure.  
  - Treatment aims to restore intake into the RDA range, with careful monitoring to avoid exceeding the UL.
- **Keshan disease**:
  - A cardiomyopathy linked to selenium deficiency and viral infection in certain regions of China.  
  - Preventive supplementation with **50–200 mcg/day** selenium has been shown to reduce incidence in endemic areas.
- **Monitoring and biomarkers**:
  - Serum/plasma selenium ≥ **8 µg/dL** is generally considered adequate.  
  - Selenoprotein P and glutathione peroxidase activity can serve as functional markers, though they are influenced by inflammation and are not widely used in routine practice.

## Deficiency

Selenium deficiency is uncommon in the U.S. and other regions with selenium-rich soils and varied diets, but it has distinct clinical manifestations.

- **Major deficiency syndromes**:
  - **Keshan disease**: Dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure and arrhythmias in selenium‑deficient areas of China.  
  - **Kashin–Beck disease**: Osteoarthropathy causing joint deformities in children; etiology appears multifactorial (selenium deficiency plus environmental toxins/infections).
- **Clinical features**:
  - Myalgia, muscle weakness, fatigue.  
  - Impaired immune responses and increased susceptibility to infections.  
  - Infertility or reproductive problems.  
  - Thyroid dysfunction (goiter, hypothyroidism).  
  - In severe cases, cardiomyopathy and heart failure.
- **Risk factors**:
  - Residence in regions with low selenium soils and reliance on locally grown foods.  
  - Long‑term TPN without selenium.  
  - GI malabsorption and chronic diarrhea.  
  - Dialysis.  
  - Restrictive metabolic diets (e.g., phenylketonuria formulas without adequate selenium).  
  - HIV infection.  
  - High exposure to heavy metals (e.g., mercury), which can increase selenium requirements.
- **Management**:
  - Supplementation within RDA range, with attention to coexisting nutrient deficiencies (e.g., vitamin E), which can worsen clinical manifestations.

## Toxicity (Selenosis)

Chronic ingestion of high selenium levels leads to **selenosis**.

- **Exposure levels**:
  - The adult UL is **400 mcg/day**; chronic toxicity typically occurs at intakes **>900 mcg/day**.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.  
  - Fatigue, irritability.  
  - Hair loss (alopecia) and brittle nails.  
  - Dermatitis and skin rashes.  
  - Peripheral neuropathy (paresthesias, pain).  
  - Garlic-like breath odor from volatile selenium metabolites.
- **Acute poisoning**:
  - Rare but can result from ingestion of extremely high doses, causing acute respiratory distress, myocardial necrosis, kidney failure and potentially death.
- **Sources of overdose**:
  - Excessive use of selenium supplements or high-selenium products.  
  - Environmental contamination of water or food from industrial emissions.  
  - Certain traditional or folk medicines.  
  - Overconsumption of Brazil nuts or other very high-selenium foods.
- **Management**:
  - Immediate discontinuation of excess intake and supportive care.  
  - No specific antidote is available.

## Drug & Nutrient Interactions

- **Vitamin E**:
  - Selenium and vitamin E act synergistically in antioxidant pathways; deficiency in one can exacerbate oxidative damage when the other is low.
- **Chemotherapy (cisplatin)**:
  - Selenium may help mitigate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity but might also interfere with antitumor efficacy; clinical evidence is limited, so routine use is not recommended.
- **Statins and fibrates**:
  - Inhibition of selenoprotein synthesis has been suggested as a factor in statin-induced myopathy, but clear benefit from selenium supplementation in this context has not been established.
- **Heavy metals**:
  - Selenium can form inert complexes with mercury, arsenic and cadmium, reducing their toxicity; high exposure to these metals may increase selenium requirements.
- **Absorption interactions**:
  - High sulfur amino acid intake may reduce selenium absorption.  
  - Vitamin C may reduce selenate to less absorbable forms, potentially lowering bioavailability under some conditions.

## Special Populations

- **Pregnancy & lactation**:
  - Requirements modestly increase to **60 µg/day** in pregnancy and **70 µg/day** during lactation.  
  - Adequate selenium supports thyroid function and fetal development; deficiency may increase risk of miscarriage or complications.  
  - Supplementation beyond RDA should be medically supervised to avoid toxicity.
- **Infants & children**:
  - Meeting AI/RDA values is important for growth, immune function and thyroid health.  
  - Breast milk and formula typically provide sufficient selenium when maternal status and formulas are adequate.
- **Elderly**:
  - May have reduced absorption and less varied diets, increasing risk of suboptimal intake.  
  - Supplement use should be cautious due to reduced renal clearance.
- **Renal impairment**:
  - Selenium is primarily excreted in urine; accumulation may occur in end-stage renal disease.  
  - Supplementation should be reduced or avoided, and levels monitored when possible.

## Conclusion

Selenium is an essential micronutrient incorporated into selenoproteins that are central to antioxidant defenses, endocrine regulation, immune competence and reproductive health. While overt deficiency is rare in North America, maintaining adequate intake through selenium-containing foods (nuts, seafood, meats, whole grains) is important. For adults, the **RDA is 55 µg/day** and the **UL is 400 µg/day**, above which the risk of selenosis increases. Selenium supplementation should be reserved for individuals with confirmed deficiency or increased requirements and used judiciously to avoid toxicity. Current evidence does not support high-dose selenium supplements for general cancer or chronic disease prevention, and clinical decisions should be individualized based on patient context.
