## 1. Identity & Taxonomy

**Purpose:** Defines rosemary's botanical identity, classification, and naming conventions for accurate reference.

**Clinical Importance:** Clinicians and researchers must distinguish Salvia rosmarinus from related species to ensure correct usage and sourcing.

### Scientific Name and Classification

**Current Accepted Name:** Salvia rosmarinus Spenn. This nomenclature was accepted after 2017 reclassification based on genetic studies confirming rosemary as a true sage. Previously known as Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Linnaeus, 1753).

**Taxonomic Classification:**
- **Family:** Lamiaceae (mint family)
- **Order:** Lamiales
- **Genus:** Salvia (sage genus), which includes Salvia officinalis (common sage)
- **Historical Context:** Formerly the sole or primary species in genus Rosmarinus

**Authority:** The epithet "Salvia rosmarinus Spenn." acknowledges Leonhart Spenner (1835) who first described it under Salvia. The synonym Rosmarinus officinalis L. carries Linnaeus's authority.

### Common Names by Language

**Primary Name:** Rosemary (English)

**International Names:**
- Spanish: Romero
- French: Romarin
- German: Rosmarin
- Italian: Rosmarino
- Portuguese: Alecrim
- Arabic: Ikleel al-Jabal (إكليل الجبل, literally "crown of the mountain")
- South Asian contexts: Rusmari

**Historical Name:** "Dew of the Sea" (Latin: ros marinus), reflecting its ability to thrive near coasts.

### Related Species and Potential Adulterants

**Closely Related Species:** Salvia jordanii (formerly Rosmarinus eriocalyx), sometimes termed "Spanish rosemary," is native to Iberia and North Africa. It could be confused or interchanged in commerce.

**Adulteration Risk:** No major toxic adulterants of rosemary leaf are known due to its distinctive aroma from volatile oils. Adulteration is more concerning with rosemary essential oil, which might be diluted with cheaper oils such as eucalyptus or turpentine derivatives rich in 1,8-cineole.

**Quality Assurance:** Ensure Latin binomial name and source verification on product labeling.

### Geographic Origin and Distribution

**Native Range:** Mediterranean basin including Southern Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. Natural habitat includes coastal regions of Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and Mediterranean islands.

**Current Distribution:** Cultivated worldwide in temperate climates, particularly in herb gardens.

**Growth Conditions:**
- USDA Hardiness Zones: 8-11
- Habitat: Sunny, dry slopes and limestone hills near the sea
- Soil tolerance: Drought-tolerant, tolerates poor soils
- Cold sensitivity: Not extreme cold hardy

**Cultivation Status:** Multiple ornamental and culinary cultivars exist in both upright and prostrate forms.

### Clinical Recommendation

Use the Latin name Salvia rosmarinus on formularies to avoid confusion. Verify that any "rosemary" product contains Salvia rosmarinus leaf or oil. While adulteration is uncommon due to distinctive aroma, essential oil authenticity should be verified through supplier testing.

## 2. Botanical Description

**Purpose:** Describes rosemary's morphology and growth characteristics for identification and quality assessment.

**Clinical Relevance:** Understanding plant appearance helps practitioners identify correct herbal material and informs harvesting practices and constituent localization.

### Plant Morphology

**Growth Form:** Woody perennial evergreen shrub, typically 1-2 m (3-6 feet) tall in upright varieties. Some cultivars are prostrate, trailing along the ground.

**Stem Characteristics:**
- Angular with square cross-section (characteristic of Lamiaceae)
- Woody at base
- Multiple side branches
- Young stems green, maturing to brown-gray

### Leaf Structure

**Appearance:**
- Leathery texture
- Narrow, needle-like shape (2-4 cm long, 2-5 mm broad)
- Arrangement: Opposite on stems
- Upper surface: Deep green and glossy
- Lower surface: White-gray with dense woolly hairs
- Margins: Revolute (edges curl under)

**Organoleptic Properties:**
- Highly aromatic when crushed
- Scent: Camphoraceous, piney
- Taste: Bitter-pungent with slightly resinous quality (due to diterpenes and volatile oils)

### Flowers

**Structure:**
- Two-lipped (bilabiate), typical of mint family
- Size: Approximately 1 cm
- Color: Pale blue to lavender, sometimes white or pink
- Arrangement: Clusters (whorls) of 2-10 at leaf axils on upper branches
- Season: Peak flowering in spring and early summer; in warm climates can flower year-round
- Pollination: Rich in nectar, attracts bees and pollinators (source of rosemary honey)

### Fruit and Seeds

**Fruit Type:** Small brown nutlets (four per flower, typical of Lamiaceae)

**Observation:** Not commonly observed unless flowers are pollinated and left to mature. Rosemary is often harvested before significant seed set.

### Root System

**Type:** Fibrous root network adapted to dry soils

**Characteristics:** Older shrubs become well-rooted and highly drought-tolerant.

### Differentiation from Similar Plants

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Differs from thyme or savory by much larger, needle-like leaves
- May superficially resemble conifer twigs but aroma readily differentiates
- Distinct from lavender: lavender has silvery, softer leaves and flowers on distinct spikes
- Different from sand heath (Ceratoliola ericoides, "Florida rosemary"): not used culinarily or medicinally

### Medicinal Parts and Harvesting

**Medicinal Parts:** Leaf and flowering tops (folium Rosmarini)

**Optimal Harvest Time:** Just as plants begin to bloom, maximizing volatile oil content in leaves

**Sustainable Harvesting:** Clipping branches (rosemary tolerates pruning well) and allowing regrowth. Wild populations are not generally endangered.

**Processing:**
- Aerial parts usually air-dried in shade to preserve volatile oils
- Dried rosemary leaf: green-gray and very aromatic
- Volatile oil content: 1-2% in dry leaf (varies by chemotype and growing conditions)

### Active vs Inactive Parts

**Active Parts:**
- Leaves: Contain bulk of volatile oils and polyphenols
- Flowers: Similar chemical profile to leaves
- Combined aerial parts: Optimal for medicinal preparations

**Inactive Parts:**
- Stems: Generally considered inert filler (contain some volatile oil in cortex)
- Berries/nuts: Not used medicinally

**Essential Oil:** Distilled from leaves and flowering tops (Rosmarini aetheroleum)

### Clinical Identification Summary

Rosemary is unmistakable once familiar: woody evergreen herb with needle-like aromatic leaves and small blue bilabiate flowers. Only leaves and flowering aerial parts are used medicinally. Quality material should be green, fragrant, and free of excessive woody stem. Proper identification ensures potency and safety, as active volatile oils and diterpenes reside predominantly in foliage.

  - Mast cell stabilization
  - Complement inhibition
- Clinical analog: Perilla and lemon balm (rich in rosmarinic acid) reduced seasonal allergy symptoms

**Rosemary-Specific Evidence:**
- Not tested in allergic rhinitis
- Mechanism present: Rosmarinic acid reduces allergic IgE activation cascades

**Immunomodulatory Aspects:**
- Influence on T-lymphocyte activity
- Affects cytokine profiles
- Per in vitro studies: Skews away from excessive Th2 responses

### Cancer-related Mechanisms (Experimental)

**Preclinical Evidence:**

**Carnosol and Carnosic Acid:**
- Induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines
- Mechanisms:
  - Upregulating pro-apoptotic Bax
  - Downregulating Bcl-2
  - Causing cell cycle arrest at G2/M
- Inhibit MMPs and invasion
- Indicate anti-metastatic potential

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Chelates iron
- Protects DNA from free radical damage
- Potentially reduces carcinogenesis initiation

**In Vivo Evidence:**
- High doses rosemary extract inhibited tumor growth in rodents
- Example: Slowed mammary tumor development
- Human phase I trial: Rosemary extract for colon cancer risk biomarkers
- Found high doses modulated detox enzyme expression

**Clinical Status:**
- Findings promising but currently preclinical
- No clinical recommendation for rosemary as cancer therapy
- Mechanisms support possible adjunctive antioxidant role
- Generally not pro-oxidant even at higher intakes

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Oral bioavailability: ~20-25% from herbal preparations
- Peak plasma levels: 0.5-1 hour
- Form: Often conjugated (glucuronides)

**Carnosic Acid:**
- Lipophilic
- Better absorbed with fats
- May accumulate in fatty tissues or brain (animal models)

**Volatile Components:**
- Example: Cineole
- Rapidly absorbed
- Crosses blood-brain barrier
- Inhalation produces measurable plasma cineole
- Correlates with cognitive effects

#### Distribution

**Polyphenols (Rosmarinic Acid):**
- Distribute in plasma bound to albumin
- Enter tissues with high perfusion
- Some CNS crossing (trace amounts detected in rodent brains)

#### Metabolism

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Via glucuronidation and sulfation (phase II)
- Yields urinary glucuronides of:
  - Caffeic acid
  - m-Coumaric acid

**Carnosic Acid:**
- Phase I metabolism in liver (hydroxylation)
- Can convert to carnosol and other diterpene metabolites

**1,8-Cineole:**
- Mainly oxidized by CYP3A to hydroxycineole
- Then conjugated

#### Elimination

**Rosmarinic and Caffeic Acid Metabolites:**
- Mostly excreted in urine within 24 hours

**Essential Oil Components:**
- Exhaled (breath smells of rosemary)
- Renally excreted after conjugation
- No significant bioaccumulation with moderate daily intake

#### Half-life

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Plasma half-life: ~1-2 hours (rapid metabolism)
- Effects (enzyme induction) may last longer

**Cineole:**
- Plasma half-life: ~1.5-3 hours

### CYP Interactions

**Important Findings:**

**Carnosic Acid and Carnosol:**
- In vitro effects:
  - Induce CYP1A1
  - Inhibit CYP3A4
- Dual effect might shift estrogen metabolism
  - Less 16α-hydroxylation
  - More 2-hydroxylation
- Clinical significance not confirmed
- Suggests caution with narrow-index CYP3A4 drugs
- Could potentially raise levels by inhibition
- In vivo evidence scant

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Did not strongly inhibit major CYPs in one study
- Showed potential inhibition at high concentrations:
  - CYP2C9
  - Some UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
- Unlikely to cause interactions at dietary doses
- High-dose extracts theoretically could cause interactions

**Essential Oil Components:**
- 1,8-Cineole can induce liver enzymes (phase II glutathione enzymes) in animals
- Overall considered relatively low risk for PK interactions at normal doses
- Inhalation study: Rosemary oil showed mild enzyme induction in rats
- Case: Patient on CYP3A4-metabolized anti-epileptic using daily rosemary aromatherapy
  - No seizure medication level changes
  - Systematic data lacking

### Hormonal & Miscellaneous Effects

**Estrogenic Activity:**
- Mild estrogenic activity from rosemary flavones (like genkwanin)
- Bind weakly to estrogen receptors
- Simultaneously: Carnosol inhibits estrogen binding in breast cancer cells
- Acts as phytoestrogen or anti-estrogen depending on context
- Net human effect probably minimal
- Might slightly support menopausal symptom relief with other herbs

**Memory Consolidation and Cerebral Blood Flow:**
- Animal studies demonstrate rosemary:
  - Increases cerebral circulation (BP uptick and brain artery vasodilation)
  - Boosts expression of synaptic proteins
- Trial in older adults: Low dose improved memory speed
- High dose impaired memory
- Suggests inverted U-shaped dose-response

**Mechanism of Dose-Response:**
- Low doses: Optimize neurotransmission and arousal
- High doses: Possible over-stimulation or slight toxicity impairing cognition
- Aligns with GABA antagonism by camphor at high levels

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary's pharmacological actions span multiple systems:

**CNS:**
- Stimulation and protection
- Cholinesterase inhibition
- GABA modulation
- Antioxidant neuroprotection

**Anti-inflammatory/Analgesic:**
- COX-2/LOX inhibition
- NF-κB suppression
- Opioid pathway modulation

**Metabolic:**
- Insulin sensitivity
- Enzyme induction

**Antimicrobial:**
- Volatile oil action

These mechanisms validate traditional uses:
- Memory enhancement: AChE inhibition and cerebral perfusion
- Digestive aid: Smooth muscle relaxation and bile stimulation
- Mood uplift: GABA and monoamine modulation
- Pain relief: Anti-inflammatory and central pathways

Safety implications:
- Camphor's neuroexcitation explains seizure risk if overdosed
- NF-κB inhibition suggests combining with immunosuppressants might not be problematic (generally mild)

Rosemary acts as a gentle "multi-target" herb, not hitting any single pathway with drug-like intensity but exerting synergistic mild effects across systems, yielding net therapeutic benefit for mild to moderate conditions.

## 6. Clinical Indications & Evidence Map

**Purpose:** Summarizes key clinical uses with evidence grading (A=strong, D=preliminary).

**Clinical Application:** Guides evidence-informed recommendations.

### Evidence Grading System

**Grade A:** None yet (no large multi-center trials or meta-analyses solely for rosemary)

**Grade B:** Supported by at least one moderate-quality RCT or consistent smaller RCTs
- Cognitive function
- Alopecia
- Dysmenorrhea
- Adjunct depression

**Grade C:** Limited human evidence, often one small trial or traditional use primarily
- Dyspepsia
- Anxiety in general population
- Arthritis topical use

**Grade D:** Theoretical or only preclinical evidence
- Dementia
- Cancer
- Immune support

**Grading Considerations:** Each grade weighs consistency and effect size. Rosemary's positive trials generally show moderate effect sizes in relatively small samples.

### Cognitive Enhancement (Memory, Alertness)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Patients with age-related memory decline or seeking mental "boost" (students, professionals) inquire about rosemary for cognitive enhancement.

#### Key Clinical Trials

**Pengelly et al. 2012 (PMID: 21877951):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=28, older adults (mean age 75)
- **Intervention:** Single-dose crossover comparing 4 doses of dried rosemary leaf (750 mg, 1,500 mg, 3,000 mg, 6,000 mg) vs. placebo
- **Duration:** Cognitive performance assessed over 6 hours
- **Results:**
  - Only lowest dose (750 mg) significantly improved memory speed vs. placebo (+15% cognitive processing speed; P=0.01)
  - Highest dose (6 g) impaired memory (slower recall, P<0.01 vs. placebo)
  - Intermediate doses: Mixed, non-significant trends
- **Interpretation:** Biphasic dose response (small amounts sharpen mind, excessive dulls it)
- **Safety:** No serious adverse effects, high dose caused subjective "mental fog"

**Nematolahi et al. 2018 (PMID: 29389474):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=68, young adults (university students)
- **Intervention:** 500 mg rosemary powder BID vs. placebo
- **Duration:** 1 month
- **Results:**
  - Significant improvement in self-reported memory (prospective memory score improved ~30% vs. placebo slight worsening; P<0.001)
  - Overall cognitive functioning improved
  - Reduced anxiety
  - Better sleep quality (sleep latency unchanged)
- **Measures:** Subjective, but consistency across cognitive and mood domains strengthens credibility
- **Safety:** No significant side effects; mild rosemary aroma burps in a few participants

**Aromatherapy Evidence:**
- Healthy volunteers: Inhalation of rosemary essential oil improved memory recall and alertness
- Moss et al.: Rosemary aroma significantly increased prospective memory and reaction times
- Correlation with serum 1,8-cineole levels
- Note: Very strong aroma could increase test-taking anxiety in one study

#### Mechanisms

1. **Cholinesterase Inhibition:** Cineole and terpenes improve cholinergic neurotransmission
2. **Nrf2 Antioxidant Upregulation:** Carnosic acid protects neurons from oxidative stress (relevant to aging brains)
3. **Cerebral Blood Flow:** Rosemary's hypertensive and vasodilatory effects may enhance brain perfusion transiently
4. **Anxiety Reduction:** In chronic use, indirectly improves cognitive function (less test anxiety = better performance)

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Age-related forgetfulness
- Mild cognitive impairment
- Exam preparation
- Patients with "brain fog"

**Key Principle:** More is not better – stick to ~750 mg dried herb or equivalent. Higher doses may backfire.

**Administration:**
- Oral: 750 mg dried rosemary leaf in morning OR 1 cup rosemary tea (1-2 g, steeped 5-10 min)
- Inhalation: Sniffing rosemary essential oil for 5 minutes before cognitive task
- Timing: Acute alertness within 1 hour; sustained memory benefits need daily use for weeks

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Acute alertness within hours
- Fuller memory clarity after several weeks of consistent use

**Monitoring:**
- Track forgetful episodes
- Monitor blood pressure (especially in hypertensives)

**Contraindications:**
- Severe cognitive impairment (insufficient evidence for dementia, Grade D)
- Should not replace standard care

**Patient Counseling:**
- Gentle tonic, not potent drug
- Avoid large doses/concentrated extracts for cognitive use
- Combine with brain exercises, adequate sleep

---

### Mood and Anxiety (Adjunctive)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Patients with mild anxiety or those on antidepressants seeking augmentation.

#### Key Clinical Evidence

**Anxiety/Stress in Healthy Subjects:**
- Student RCT (above): Rosemary 1 g/day
- Significant reductions in anxiety scores (HADS anxiety subscale down ~4 points vs. minimal change placebo, P<0.001)
- Students reported feeling more refreshed, less mentally fatigued
- Population: Everyday stress, not anxiety disorder

**Major Depression Adjunct (Azizi et al. 2022, PMID: 36343423):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=60, adults with MDD
- **Intervention:** Rosemary 1 g/day alongside SSRI vs. SSRI + placebo
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Results:**
  - Greater improvement in depressive symptoms
  - Mean BDI dropped: 32→17 (rosemary) vs. 31→24 (placebo), P<0.001
  - Significantly lower anxiety (HADS-A: 12→6 vs. 13→10, P<0.05)
  - Cognitive complaints improved only in rosemary group
- **Safety:** No significant side effects or dropout differences

**Mechanistic Support:**
- Animal models: Rosemary has antidepressant-like effects via:
  - Reducing neuro-inflammation (lower IL-6 in brain)
  - Modulating monoamines (might mildly inhibit MAO-A enzyme, increasing serotonin)
- Human trials: Improved sleep quality (can itself improve mood)

**Aromatherapy for Anxiety:**
- Small studies and anecdote support using rosemary essential oil in blends
- Trial in dialysis patients: Inhaling lavender-rosemary reduced anxiety and pulse
- Note: Pure rosemary aroma can sometimes increase alertness in way that feels like anxiety
- Context matters: For relaxation, rosemary better used with calming oils
- Alone: More energizing than tranquilizing

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Subthreshold anxiety
- Depressed mood (adjunctive)
- Stressed individuals with mental fatigue
- Patients tapering off conventional anxiolytics

**Not a Stand-alone Treatment For:**
- Major anxiety disorder
- Major depression (use as adjunct only)

**Administration:**
- 500 mg dried rosemary leaf capsule BID (morning and early afternoon)
- Effects on anxiety: Noticeable within 2-4 weeks
- For situational anxiety: Combine with lavender via inhalation (2 drops rosemary + 2 drops lavender on tissue, inhale 5 minutes)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Moderate effect size
- Better mood, less anxiety, better sleep
- Pattern: Low-risk option for stressed students, peri-menopausal women with mood swings

**Safety:**
- No serious concerns at 1 g/day
- Unlike kava: No sedation or cognitive dulling
- No dependence risk
- Might slightly raise BP (monitor in anxious hypertensive patients)

**Patient Counseling:**
- Not a miracle cure, moderate benefits
- If anxiety severe or impairing: Primary treatments (CBT, SSRIs) should not be replaced
- Rosemary is adjunct
- Can combine with conventional treatments under supervision

### Hair Loss (Androgenetic Alopecia)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Common condition with patients seeking natural alternatives to minoxidil/finasteride.

#### Key Clinical Evidence

**Panahi et al. 2015 (PMID: 25842469):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=100, young adults with AGA (50 per group)
- **Intervention:** Rosemary essential oil (undiluted, massaged into scalp) vs. 2% minoxidil lotion, daily
- **Duration:** 6 months
- **Results:**
  - 3 months: Neither group significant hair count change (expected lag)
  - 6 months: Both groups showed significant increase in hair count (~+15-20 hairs per 1 cm² area vs. baseline, P<0.05)
  - No difference between rosemary and minoxidil in efficacy
  - Scalp itching: Common in both but worse with minoxidil (38% vs. 16% at 6 months, P<0.05)
  - Other side effects (dandruff, oily hair): Similar and mild
- **Conclusion:** Rosemary oil equally effective as 2% minoxidil in mild-moderate AGA over 6 months, with less scalp irritation

#### Mechanistic Plausibility

1. **Improved Scalp Microcirculation:** Dilates small blood vessels, increases perfusion, enhances nutrient delivery to hair follicles
2. **5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibition:** Carnosic acid might weakly block DHT conversion in follicles (far milder than finasteride)
3. **Anti-inflammatory:** Reduces folliculitis that often accompanies AGA

#### Alopecia Areata Evidence

**Hay et al. 1998:**
- Essential oil blend (rosemary, thyme, lavender, cedarwood) vs. placebo oil
- Duration: 7 months
- Results: 44% essential oil group had significant regrowth vs. 15% control (P=0.008)
- Note: Multiple oils used, rosemary's distinct contribution uncertain

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Androgenetic alopecia (male/female pattern hair loss)
- Early or mild AGA
- Patients hesitant about conventional options
- Can be used in women with AGA (fewer medical options available)

**Application Method:**
- Mix ~5 drops pure rosemary essential oil in 1 teaspoon carrier oil (~2% dilution)
- Massage into scalp over thinning areas once daily
- Leave on: Several hours or overnight, then wash if desired
- Some incorporate into shampoo/conditioner (brief contact time, leave-on preferred)

**Duration and Expectations:**
- Minimum: 6 months continuous use needed
- No improvement at 3 months: Expected (hair growth lag)
- Initial shedding possible (follicles shift phase, similar to minoxidil)
- Regrowth: Modest (few hairs per cm² increase)
- Requires continuous use (like minoxidil, stopping may reverse gains)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Comparable to 2% minoxidil after 6 months
- Less side effects (itching)
- Set realistic expectations: Modest improvement, not full reversal

**Combination Approaches:**
- May combine with microneedling or low-level laser therapy
- Evidence on combinations not yet available

**Safety:**
- Dilute properly (avoid undiluted EO on scalp for prolonged periods)
- Avoid eye contact
- Pregnant women: Avoid (minimal systemic absorption expected, but err on caution)

**Patient Counseling:**
- Patience required: 6+ months
- Initial shedding: Reassure, encourage continuation
- Evaluate at 6 months: If no improvement, rosemary may not be effective for them
- Can be used alongside topical treatments under guidance

### Dysmenorrhea (Menstrual Cramps)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Primary dysmenorrhea common among young women. Some prefer herbal remedies over NSAIDs.

#### Key Clinical Evidence

**Tahoonian et al. 2019:**
- **Design:** RCT, n=82, college students with primary dysmenorrhea
- **Intervention:** Rosemary capsules 250 mg TID vs. mefenamic acid 250 mg TID
- **Timing:** First 3 days of menstruation, for 2 cycles
- **Results:**
  - Pain scores (0-100 VAS):
    - Rosemary: 40.4→23.6 (41% reduction, P<0.001)
    - Mefenamic: 46.8→28.3 (39% reduction, P<0.001)
    - No significant difference between groups
  - Menstrual bleeding: Both groups showed slight reduction (~16% rosemary, 15% mefenamic)
  - Practical interpretation: Both improved pain from moderate to mild
- **Significance:** Rosemary matched NSAID efficacy (mefenamic acid is potent prostaglandin inhibitor)

#### Mechanisms

1. **Prostaglandin Synthesis Inhibition:** Rosmarinic acid/carnosol's COX-2 inhibition reduces menstrual prostaglandin F2α levels
2. **Smooth Muscle Relaxation:** Volatile oils act directly on uterine muscle to relieve spasm
3. **Menstrual Flow Effects:** Traditionally said to increase flow (emmenagogue), but study showed slight decrease in excessive bleeding (prostaglandin inhibition reduces heavy bleeding)

#### Comparison to Other Herbals

**Ginger:** Another well-studied herb for dysmenorrhea
- Shows ~48% pain reduction vs. ~22% placebo in some trials
- Rosemary's efficacy appears comparable in magnitude
- Hypothetical combination: Ginger + rosemary could address both inflammation and spasm (untested)

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Primary dysmenorrhea
- Patients seeking natural remedy
- Those who cannot take NSAIDs (allergy or ulcer risk)
- May also ease associated symptoms (menstrual headaches, digestive upset)

**Administration:**
- 250 mg dried rosemary leaf TID during menses
- Start: Onset of menses or one day before if cycles regular
- Duration: First 2-3 days of period (when cramps worst)
- Form: Capsules (standardized ~1-2% rosmarinic acid) OR tea (2 g in 150 ml, TID)
- Take with food (gentler on stomach than NSAIDs)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Pain scores should drop over 2-3 cycles
- Reduced reliance on rescue analgesics
- Monitor effectiveness: If insufficient relief, escalate therapy or add heat therapy

**Combination Approaches:**
- Can combine with conventional NSAIDs (no known contraindication)
- Or combine with other anti-spasmodic herbs (cramp bark)

**Safety:**
- Generally well-tolerated
- No major side effects reported in trial
- Women may appreciate avoiding NSAID side effects (gastritis)

**Patient Counseling:**
- Regular dosing during painful period, not just one dose
- If stomach upset: Take with food or use tea form
- Can drink rosemary tea if prefer (though sufficient dose via tea requires strong brew)
- Very severe pain: Combining with conventional NSAIDs possible

---

### Indigestion & Functional Dyspepsia

**Evidence Grade:** C

**Clinical Context:** Bloating, flatulence, upset stomach often managed with diet and OTC aids. Herbal carminatives traditionally used.

#### Evidence Summary

**Regulatory Recognition:**
- EMA community monograph recognizes Rosmarinus officinalis folium as traditional herbal medicinal product
- Indication: "Symptomatic relief of dyspepsia and mild spasmodic disorders of the GI tract"
- Based on longstanding use

**Indirect Clinical Evidence:**
- Multi-herb products containing rosemary have shown benefit
- Example: Iberis amara + caraway, chamomile, peppermint, rosemary (product "STW-5" or Iberogast)
- RCTs: Multi-herb formula significantly improved GI symptom scores vs. placebo (NNT ~3)
- Rosemary's specific contribution hard to isolate
- Provides spasmolysis and choleretic effect

**Anecdotal Evidence:**
- Rosemary tea after meals reduces gas and bloating
- Small Iranian trial (uncontrolled, n=20): Rosemary syrup before meals
- Most reported less fullness and pain
- Without control: Low evidence quality

#### Mechanisms

1. **Smooth Muscle Relaxation:** Volatile oils relax stomach and intestinal muscles
2. **Alleviates Cramps:** Relieves "knots" in stomach
3. **Choleretic Effect:** Increases bile flow (supports fat digestion)
4. **Carminative Effect:** Helps expulsion of gas
5. **Digestive Stimulation:** Bitter diterpenes stimulate digestive secretions

**Anxiety Overlap:**
- Many dyspepsia sufferers have anxiety/stress component
- Rosemary's anxiolytic effect might indirectly help stress-triggered dyspepsia

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Mild functional dyspepsia
- Bloating, gas, spasmodic upper abdominal discomfort
- Particularly helpful when associated with stress or over-eating rich foods

**Not a Replacement For:**
- Evaluation of serious causes
- Alarm features (weight loss, GI bleeding) require investigation

**Administration:**
- **Infusion:** 1-2 g dried rosemary leaf in 1 cup boiling water, steep ~10 min (cover to retain volatiles)
- **Frequency:** 2-3 times daily (before or after meals)
- **Tincture Alternative:** 2-3 mL rosemary tincture (1:5 in 45% alcohol) before meals
- **Combination:** Often combined with other carminatives (fennel, peppermint)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduced gas and more comfortable digestion within days
- If no improvement in 1-2 weeks: Requires other interventions

**Safety:**
- Generally well tolerated
- Unlike peppermint: No known reflux-worsening effect
- As bitter: Stimulates acid, so GERD patients should monitor if tea triggers heartburn
- Caffeine-free: Good evening digestive

**Patient Counseling:**
- Gentle for "nervous stomach"
- May be especially helpful when dyspepsia associated with stress
- Should not replace evaluation for serious causes
- For typical IBS-like dyspepsia: Cup of rosemary-mint tea after meals is reasonable integrative approach

  - Dizziness if hypotensive
- **Memory trial:** Used up to 6 g acute with only cognition issues, no adverse physical events
- **Recommendation:** Typical therapeutic doses safe

#### Hepatic/Renal Impairment

**No direct data available**

**Hepatic:**
- Rosemary polyphenols hepatically metabolized
- Not known to stress liver
- Traditionally: Cholagogue (may help liver function)
- Essential oil: Mostly cleared hepatically/renally
- **Severe impairment:** Use caution with essential oil (potential accumulation of camphor/cineole)
- **Recommendation:** Herb/tea forms gentler if cirrhosis present

**Renal (CKD Stage 4-5):**
- Stick to herb/tea forms
- More caution with essential oil
- Rosemary as seasoning beneficial (replace salt)

### Administration Tips

#### Timing Considerations

**For cognitive/mood uses:**
- Morning dosing important (leverage alertness)
- Avoid large doses late at night (may interfere with sleep despite one trial showing improved sleep quality)
- Exception: In student trial, improved sleep quality likely via anxiety reduction

**For hair application:**
- Consistency crucial
- Daily routine (e.g., every night before bed)
- Don't expect changes for 3 months (manage expectations)

**For dysmenorrhea:**
- Start at onset of menses or one day before if cycles regular
- Continue for first 2-3 days when cramps worst

**For digestive issues:**
- Before meals: Bitters work best
- After meals: Acceptable for gas relief

#### Combining with Other Supplements

**Synergistic Combinations:**
- **With Sage:** For memory (both have cineole, different polyphenols)
- **With Ginger or Cinnamon:** For dysmenorrhea (different anti-inflammatory constituents)
- **With Peppermint:** For IBS (peppermint relaxes gut, rosemary adds anti-anxiety)
- **No known antagonistic combinations**

**Standardization Check:**
- If using commercial capsule: Check label for marker compounds
- Ideally: Rosmarinic acid or carnosic acid content specified
- If unlabeled: Use established brand to ensure potency

### Clinical Dosing Summary

Rosemary dosing is flexible and forgiving at lower doses. Issues arise only at very high doses (multiple grams at once). Typical therapeutic regimen: ~1-2 g herb daily (divided doses).

**Form Selection:**
- **Tea:** For those who enjoy rituals and hydration
- **Capsule:** For convenience
- **Tincture:** If combining in formulas

**Essential Oil Use:**
- High potency: Measure drops carefully
- Never ingest or apply undiluted

**Key Principle:** With prudent dosing, rosemary is safe and can be tailored to individual needs and lifestyle.

- Vomiting
- Uterine bleeding (in pregnant women)
- Theoretical nephritis

### Long-Term Safety

**No Evidence of Organ Damage:** At typical doses over months to years

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Constituents largely antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
- Animal studies: No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity
- Rosemary extract negative in Ames tests
- Chronic feeding in rats (up to 1% of diet):
  - No increase in tumors
  - Some reduction in spontaneous tumor rate (presumably due to antioxidant effect)

**Conclusion:** Long-term use of rosemary in moderate range considered safe

**Mediterranean Diet Context:**
- Regular rosemary consumption without ill effect
- Traditional dietary inclusion supports safety profile

### Organ-Specific Safety

#### Liver

**Assessment:** No hepatotoxicity seen
**Evidence:** If anything, hepatoprotective in animal models
**Lab Tests:** ALT/AST remained normal or improved in human trials
- NAFLD patients on rosemary: Lowered ALT from weight loss diet in both groups
- No extra spike from rosemary

#### Kidney

**Standard Doses:** Normal use fine
**High Doses:** Historical caution (see Contraindications)
**Positive Use:** Used in herbal diuretics (Canephron) without kidney harm
**Benefit:** May benefit microcirculation in kidneys

#### Central Nervous System

**Seizures:** Only in oil overdose scenario
**Cognitive Effects:**
- No impairment on chronic use
- Acute impairment at 6g dose: Dose-specific and transient
**Long-term:** No issues reported

#### Reproductive System

**Fertility:** No data on long-term fertility impact
**Theoretical:** Rosemary antioxidants might improve circulation (unlikely negative effect)
**Formal Studies:** Lacking

### Special Safety Considerations

#### Blood Pressure

**Effect:** Can raise BP slightly, especially with essential oil
**Context:** One trial giving rosemary oil orally TID noted increased systolic and diastolic BP in chronic hypotension
**Clinical Implication:**
- Hypertensive patients: Monitor with high-dose use
- Hypotensive patients: May benefit from improved BP

#### Pregnancy Safety

**Culinary Use:** Safe
**Medicinal Doses:** Caution advised
**Concern:** Historical abortifacient reputation
**Mechanism:** Can cause uterine bleeding in overdose
**Evidence:** Rosmarinic acid might have emmenagogue effect
**Guideline:** Do not prescribe rosemary supplements or oil to pregnant patients
**Context for Patients:** If pregnant patient drank cup of rosemary tea unknowingly
- Reassure: Very unlikely to cause harm
- Caution about regular or high amounts

#### Breastfeeding

**Small Amounts:** Acceptable in diet or tea
**High-Dose Extracts/Oil:** Avoid
**Rationale:**
- Components could pass into milk (lipophilic compounds)
- No studies confirm, but many compounds do transfer
- Strong taste might affect milk flavor (baby may feed poorly)
**Guideline:** Stick to culinary doses or low-dose tea, observe infant for unusual reactions

#### Children

**Age <5 Years:**
- Contraindicated: Internal essential oil use
- Risk: Camphor poisoning and reflex apnea
- Inhalation: Be careful, avoid in infants (menthol-like compounds can rarely cause laryngeal spasm)

**Age 6+ Years:**
- Weak rosemary tea for tummy ache acceptable (parental observation, small amounts)
- Concentrated preparations: Do not use

**Topical in Children:**
- Do not apply rosemary essential oil (even diluted) on babies or young children
- Particularly avoid nose/mouth area (risk of bronchospasm)

### Allergic Reactions

**Frequency:** Very rare

**Manifestations:**
- Contact dermatitis (topical)
- Hay fever (to rosemary pollen, rare)
- Documented cases exist but uncommon

**Anaphylaxis:**
- Wheezing
- Throat swelling
- Widespread hives
**Action:** Stop-and-refer scenario, may need antihistamines or epinephrine

**Cross-Reactivity:**
- Possible with other Lamiaceae (sage, basil, lavender)
- Not guaranteed

**Management:** If known hypersensitivity to rosemary or strong allergic history to mint family, avoid use. Testing possible (skin patch) but generally easy to substitute another herb.

### Patient Counseling for Side Effects

**Key Messages:**
1. Culinary amounts extremely safe
2. Concerns with concentrated forms
3. If starting supplement: Monitor for unusual symptoms in first week (headache, stomach upset)
4. Rare but forewarned

**Essential Oil Emphasis:**
- "Natural doesn't mean non-toxic"
- Small bottle contains huge herb equivalent
- Only use as directed topically
- Never ingest more than instructed
- Keep away from children (camphorated oil ingestion = pediatric emergency)

**Severe Reaction Protocol:**
- Difficulty breathing: Though allergic anaphylaxis to rosemary almost unheard of
- Discontinue and seek medical care

### Clinical Safety Summary

Rosemary is very safe for most people at usual doses. Minor GI or skin irritations are most likely side effects, generally easily managed. Serious adverse effects (seizures) confined to misuse/overdose of essential oil.

**Whole-Plant Therapy Advantage:**
- Does not have systemic toxicity potential of some isolated compounds or pharmaceuticals
- Reflected in benign clinical trial outcomes

**Key Safety Principle:**
- Proper dilution of essential oil
- Avoidance of extremely high doses
- Keeps rosemary well within safety zone

**Form-Specific Caution:**
- Tea and capsules: Forgiving
- Essential oil: Demands respect

Always tailor caution to form used.

**Status:** Absolute contraindication

**Details:**
- Known hypersensitivity to rosemary
- Rare but documented: Contact dermatitis or hay fever to rosemary
- Cross-reactivity possible with other mint family herbs (sage, basil, lavender)
- Not guaranteed but possible

**Testing:**
- Skin patch test for topical
- Supervised low-dose challenge for oral
- Generally easy to substitute another herb

#### Epilepsy or Seizure Disorders

**Status:** Practical contraindication primarily for rosemary essential oil (internal use)

**Rationale:**
- High concentrations of camphor can lower seizure threshold
- Certain essential oils (rosemary, sage, hyssop) traditionally advised against in epilepsy
- Pro-convulsant ketones concern

**What's Safe:**
- Herb (tea or capsule) in culinary amounts: Not known to trigger seizures
- Spice use normally: Fine

**What to Avoid:**
- Giving essential oil orally to anyone with seizure history
- Even aromatic use: Approach carefully

**Patient Context:**
- Epileptic patient wishes to use rosemary tea or spice normally: Fine
- Warn against concentrated extracts or oils

### Major Warnings and Relative Contraindications

#### Pregnancy

**Status:** Contraindicated in medicinal doses

**Safe Use:**
- Rosemary as spice: Safe during pregnancy (sprinkling on food)
- Occasional small cup of weak tea: Generally acceptable

**Not Safe:**
- High-dose rosemary (especially essential oil or strong tincture)
- Traditionally considered abortifacient and uterine stimulant

**Modern Evidence:**
- Rosemary oil can cause uterine bleeding in overdose
- Rosmarinic acid might have emmenagogue effect

**Clinical Guideline:**
- Do not prescribe rosemary supplements or oil to pregnant patients

**Patient Context:**
- If pregnant patient unknowingly drank cup of rosemary tea:
  - Reassure: Very unlikely to cause harm
  - Caution about regular or high amounts

**External Use:**
- Low concentration in cosmetic cream: Probably fine
- Many providers err on avoiding unnecessary essential oil exposure in pregnancy

#### Children (Especially <5 Years)

**Status:** Contraindicated internal use of essential oil

**Rationale:**
- Camphorated oils not to be given orally to young kids
- Risk: Camphor poisoning and reflex apnea
- Even inhalation (adding to steamer): Should be done carefully
- Typically avoided in infants (menthol-like compounds can rarely cause laryngeal spasm)

**Older Children (6+):**
- Weak rosemary tea for tummy ache: Can be given under parental observation in small amounts

**General Rule:**
- Do not use concentrated rosemary preparations in toddlers or infants

**Topical:**
- Do not apply rosemary essential oil (even diluted) on babies or young children
- Particularly around nose/mouth (risk of bronchospasm)

#### Severe GERD or Peptic Ulcer

**Status:** Relative caution

**Rationale:**
- Rosemary's bitter and aromatic oils stimulate gastric acid
- In active ulcer or severe reflux: Could aggravate symptoms

**Not Absolutely Contraindicated:**
- Some GERD patients tolerate carminative teas fine
- Monitor individual response

**Guideline:**
- If patient notices heartburn worse after rosemary tea or tincture: Discontinue

#### Iron-Deficiency Anemia

**Status:** Management consideration, not strict contraindication

**Rationale:**
- Tannins in rosemary (rosmarinic acid) could reduce iron absorption
- Similar to tea/coffee polyphenols
- If taken simultaneously with iron-rich meals or supplements

**Guideline for Anemic Patients:**
- Don't drink rosemary tea with iron pill or with iron-rich meal
- Separate by couple hours
- Not strict contraindication, just management point

#### Bleeding Disorders or Anticoagulation

**Status:** Relative caution

**Rationale:**
- Rosemary not strong anticoagulant
- In vitro: Mild antiplatelet activity
- No clinical bleeding events with rosemary reported

**Precaution:**
- Large amounts might (in theory) add slight bleeding risk in patients with:
  - Bleeding disorder
  - On warfarin

**Management:**
- Avoid concentrated extracts in such patients
- At least inform and monitor
- Topical use: Fine

**See Drug Interactions section for detail**

#### Planned Surgery

**Status:** Standard herbal guideline

**Rationale:**
- Theoretical antiplatelet effect
- Avoid herb-drug interactions with anesthesia (none known for rosemary, but routine caution)

**Guideline:**
- Advise discontinuing high-dose rosemary supplementation at least 1-2 weeks before elective surgery

#### Hypertension (Uncontrolled)

**Status:** Relative caution

**Rationale:**
- Rosemary can raise BP slightly (especially the oil)
- Someone with poorly controlled hypertension might see small increase

**Not Absolute Contraindication:**
- If patient's BP well-managed: Can use with monitoring
- If poorly controlled (e.g., 160/100): Focus on primary BP control rather than adding rosemary

**Management:**
- If patient insists on using (for memory, etc.): Use minimal effective dose
- Monitor BP regularly

#### Severe Renal Impairment

**Status:** Caution with essential oil

**Rationale:**
- No direct evidence rosemary harms kidneys
- Elimination of some constituents might be slower

**In Severe CKD (Stage 4-5):**
- Limit use of essential oil
- Herb itself in moderation: Fine
- Some CKD patients use rosemary as seasoning to replace salt (beneficial)

### Special Medical Conditions

#### Atrial Fibrillation or Tachyarrhythmias

**Concern:** High doses of stimulatory EO might increase heart rate or cause palpitations

**Guideline:** Avoid giving rosemary oil to these patients

#### History of Aspirin/NSAID-induced Bronchospasm

**Assessment:** Rosemary's salicylate content negligible

**Status:** Not contraindicated

**Note:** Doesn't have same issue as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease

#### Asthma

**Consideration:** Aroma of rosemary (like any strong odor) could trigger bronchospasm in some asthmatics

**Frequency:** Uncommon

**Mechanism:** Otherwise, rosmarinic acid actually anti-allergic (could help allergic asthma)

**No Direct Data:** But if patient notes smells trigger them, be careful with aromatherapy

### Use in Combination with CNS Stimulants

**Status:** Advisory rather than true contraindication

**Context:** Patient on amphetamines or other stimulants

**Concern:** Rosemary's cognitive stimulant property theoretically could add to jitteriness

**Guideline:** Caution combining with:
- Large amounts of caffeine
- Adderall
- Modafinil
- Other stimulants

### Warning Labels and Patient Education

**Label Recommendations:**

**Teas/Tinctures (Internal Use):**
- "Not for use in pregnancy or by individuals with epilepsy"

**Essential Oil Bottle:**
- "For external use only"
- "Do not ingest"
- "Keep away from children"
- "Dilute before use"
- "Avoid if pregnant or epileptic"

**General Patient Advice:**
- "Natural" doesn't mean any amount is safe
- Follow dosing guidelines
- If signs of overdose (severe vomiting, dizziness, convulsions): Seek medical help immediately

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary is broadly safe but requires specific precautions:

**Avoid High Doses In:**
- Pregnancy (traditional uterine stimulation concerns)
- Epilepsy (concentrated forms)

**Use Caution With Essential Oil:**
- Any vulnerable group (kids, pregnant, neuro conditions)

**For General Adult Patients:**
- Rosemary is fine
- Pay attention to context (e.g., don't add BP-elevating effect to uncontrolled hypertension without monitoring)

**Golden Rule:**
- Culinary amounts always acceptable
- Step up to supplement doses triggers these warnings

When in doubt, use rosemary in culinary amounts.

- Culinary use: No concern

**Risk Assessment:** Low, theoretical

### Notable Absences

**What Rosemary Does NOT Interact With:**

**Vitamin K:**
- Unlike some greens, rosemary doesn't contain significant vitamin K
- No interference with warfarin via vitamin K mechanism

**Hormone Therapies:**
- Rosemary not significant phytoestrogen
- Weak estrogenic components unlikely to interfere with:
  - Oral contraceptives
  - Hormone replacement therapy
  - Tamoxifen or other SERMs

**Antibiotics:**
- No known interactions with common antibiotics
- Rosemary's antimicrobial effect doesn't interfere with antibiotic action

### Herb-Drug Interaction Summary

Rosemary has remarkably clean record with medications due to:
- Usually used in modest amounts
- Multi-component mild effects rather than single strong action

**Main Cautions:**
1. **Anticoagulants:** Monitor for bleeding (theoretical)
2. **Seizure medications:** Avoid essential oil
3. **Blood pressure control:** Monitor BP

**Pharmacokinetic interactions via CYPs:** Remain theoretical with any effect likely mild given rosemary's moderate potency and typical dosing.

### Herb-Herb and Herb-Supplement Interactions

#### Stimulatory Herbs

**Combinations:**
- Guarana
- Ephedra (no longer legal)
- Large amounts of green tea
- Ma huang

**Effect:** Could collectively raise BP or cause jitteriness more than either alone

**Management:** Monitor cardiovascular effects, reduce combined stimulant load if symptoms

#### Sedative Herbs

**Combinations:**
- Valerian
- Hops
- Passionflower
- Kava

**Effect:** Rosemary might counteract sedation slightly due to alertness-promoting nature

**Context:** If taken for anxiety, probably complements (valerian calms, rosemary lifts mood - reasonable combo)

#### Blood-Thinning Herbs

**Combinations:**
- Garlic
- Ginkgo
- Feverfew
- Turmeric (high doses)

**Effect:** Small additive platelet inhibition

**Management:**
- Usually fine
- If triple therapy (garlic, ginkgo, rosemary plus aspirin): Monitor for easy bruising
- Discontinue one or more if excessive bruising occurs

### Management Strategies

**1. Communication:**
- Always ask patients to list supplements
- Many might not mention rosemary (think of it as "just a spice")
- If warfarin patient loves concentrated rosemary tea daily: Need to know

**2. Monitoring:**
- When in doubt, monitor clinical parameter of interest:
  - INR for warfarin
  - BP for hypertensives
  - Blood sugar for diabetics
  - Drug levels if concern about PK interaction

**3. Spacing:**
- For possible PK interactions: Space dosing between herb and drug
- Reduces competition in GI absorption or first-pass metabolism
- Example: Take drug at least 2 hours apart from rosemary if worried about CYP3A inhibition in gut

**4. Documentation:**
- Document any suspected interaction
- Consider reporting serious ones
- Rosemary's profile safe enough that significant interactions might be publishable case reports due to rarity

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary rarely causes significant drug interactions. Most theoretical ones (slight anticoagulation, enzyme modulation) have not proven clinically consequential at normal doses.

**Exercise Caution:**
- High-dose rosemary in patients on critical medications:
  - Anticoagulants
  - Anti-seizure drugs
  - Immunosuppressants
- Either avoid or monitor closely

**For Most Patients:**
- On common medications (antihypertensives, SSRIs, diabetes meds)
- Rosemary can be integrated smoothly
- Understanding of mild tendencies (could modestly raise BP or lower glucose)
- Careful monitoring can catch issues

**Key Advantage:**
- Lack of reported major herb-drug interactions
- One reason rosemary considered gentle and compatible herb in multi-therapy regimens

**Quality Standards:**
- European Pharmacopoeia: May require minimum essential oil content (e.g., ≥1.2% v/w in dried leaf)
- High-quality dried rosemary characteristics:
  - Green color (not brown or gray, indicating oxidation or poor drying)
  - Highly aromatic when rubbed

### Geographical Sourcing

**Major Producers:**
- Morocco
- Tunisia
- Spain
- Italy
- Greece
- Turkey
- Eastern European countries (Albania, Croatia)

**Geographic Chemotype Variations:**

**Moroccan Rosemary:**
- Often high 1,8-cineole content

**Spanish Rosemary:**
- Can be high in camphor (especially wild from Southern Spain)

**Balkan Rosemary:**
- Often intermediate profile (Bosnia, etc.)

**Selection Guidance:**
- Any source fine for internal medicinal use
- If specific chemotype desired (like low camphor for gentler oil): Specify "cineole type rosemary essential oil"
- Often preferred in aromatherapy for safety (camphor limited <20%)

### Cultivation vs Wild-Harvesting

**Cultivation:**
- Widely cultivated organically in herb farms
- Consistent quality
- Reliable supply

**Wild-Crafted:**
- Can be superb quality (e.g., Moroccan hills)
- Must ensure sustainable harvest
- Rosemary abundant, not endangered (IUCN: Not evaluated, no conservation concern)
- Hardy, beneficial shrub
- Wild harvesting in moderation acceptable

**Supply Considerations:**
- Doesn't rely solely on wild stands
- Easy to grow, reducing pressure on wild populations

### Adulteration and Authenticity

#### Dried Herb Adulteration

**Status:** Not common

**Why:** Rosemary leaf distinctive in appearance and smell

**Possible Issues:**
- Powdered rosemary could be adulterated with inert fillers
- Cheap leaves (olive leaf, other herbs)
- Choose suppliers with botanical identity testing:
  - Microscopy
  - DNA barcoding

**Risk Assessment:** Low due to rosemary's low cost

#### Essential Oil Adulteration

**More Significant Concern:**

**Related Species:**
- Sometimes from Rosmarinus eriocalyx (now also Salvia rosmarinus)
- Not major issue taxonomically (similar composition)

**Common Adulterants:**
- **Eucalyptus Oil:** Rich in cineole, can mimic rosemary cineole chemotype
- **Synthetic Camphor or Borneol:** Added to increase content cheaply

**Detection Method:**
- GC-MS analysis detects adulteration
- Unusual ratios of cineole to alpha-pinene
- Presence of compounds not normally in rosemary
- Too much p-cymene or certain sesquiterpenes (belong to eucalyptus)

**Standards:**
- Essential Oil Association has ISO standards
- Cineole type should have specified X-Y% cineole range
- Deviations indicate adulteration
- High-quality vendors provide GC-MS reports

#### Extract Adulteration

**Rosmarinic Acid Spiking:**
- Companies might spike with pure rosmarinic acid from other sources
- Cheaper sources: Perilla or Prunella
- Not dangerous but misrepresentation

**Carnosic Acid Spiking:**
- Could be from lab-synthesized sources
- Rosemary is primary natural source
- Less common issue

### Contaminant Testing

#### Heavy Metals

**Risk Profile:**
- Rosemary does not hyperaccumulate heavy metals typically
- If grown in polluted soil: Could contain lead or arsenic
- Iranian study: Some wild samples had slight heavy metal content below WHO limits

**Standard Testing:**
- Reputable suppliers test for heavy metals
- Should be <2 ppm lead, etc.

#### Microbial Contamination

**Risk:**
- If not properly dried: Possible
- Rosemary's volatile oils are somewhat antimicrobial (helps prevent mold)

**Quality Control:**
- Proper drying and storage essential
- Certificate of analysis should include microbial testing

### Pharmacopoeial Quality Tests

#### Identification Methods

**Macroscopic:**
- Needle leaves with downy underside

**Microscopic:**
- Look for peltate glandular trichomes containing oil
- 8-secretory cells (hallmark for ID)

**Chemical Fingerprinting:**
- TLC or HPTLC
- Show spots for rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid
- Spray with FeCl3: Rosmarinic acid gives green-black spot

#### Assay Standards

**European Pharmacopeia:**
- May not require assay of actives for herbal substance
- Might have assay for essential oil content by distillation
- Example: Must yield ≥1.5 mL/kg oil

**Essential Oil Standards:**
- GC must meet certain profile
- Official standard example:
  - Cineole: 25-50%
  - Camphor: 5-15%
  - α-Pinene: 10-25%
  - Borneol: 1-5%
  - Limonene: 1-5%
- Off-profile suggests adulteration or wrong species

#### Contaminant Limits

**European Pharmacopeia Likely Sets:**
- Foreign matter: Max ~5%
- Moisture: <12%
- Ash: <10%
- Pesticide residues: Within legal limits (none if organic)
- Heavy metals: <2 ppm lead
- Aflatoxins: Specified limits
- PAHs: Specified limits

**Certificate of Analysis:**
- Reputable suppliers provide CoA with these specifications

**Religious Certifications:**
- Kosher/Halal if needed
- Many herbal products carry these

### Shelf-life and Storage

#### Dried Rosemary Leaf

**Storage Life:** 1-2 years if stored properly
- Airtight container
- Away from light and heat

**Quality Indicators:**
- Gradually loses aromatic potency (oils evaporate)
- Test by smell: If bland, time to replace
- Color fades to dull brownish: Replace

#### Tinctures

**Stability:** Quite stable in alcohol
- Alcohol preserves oils and polyphenols
- Can last 3-5 years easily
- Protect from evaporation

#### Essential Oil

**Shelf Life:** 1-3 years once opened
- Depends on storage
- Can oxidize (forming peroxides)
- Oxidized oil: May increase skin sensitization

**Preservation:**
- Can add antioxidant (drop of tocopherol)
- Extends shelf-life

**Storage Recommendations:**
- Amber bottles
- Tightly capped
- Not too old or rancid-smelling
- Oxidized oil might be more irritant on scalp

### Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing

#### Sustainability Status

**Conservation:** Rosemary not endangered
- Can grow invasively in some areas
- Supply robust

**Wild-Harvesting:**
- Ensure legal and sustainable
- Some countries (Slovenia) have quotas for wild herb picking

**Cultivated Sources:**

- Mostly machine harvested or small farm produced

#### Labor and Fair Trade

**Considerations:**
- North African rosemary might be wild-collected by rural communities
- Supporting via Fair Trade channels ensures fair pay
- Important ethical consideration

**Legal Harvesting:**
- Spain: Harvesting from national parks or communal lands requires permit
- Illegal collection might undercut local farmers
- Prefer suppliers with cooperatives or traceable sourcing

### Adulterant Detection Methods

**Laboratory Testing:**

**Microscopy:**
- If olive leaves adulterated: Different trichomes
- Absence of rosemary's hair pattern

**HPLC:**
- Quantify rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid
- If extract lower than expected or ratio off: Indicates filler

**Chiral GC:**
- Differentiate natural vs. synthetic camphor by optical rotation
- Ratio of borneol to camphor: Clue to adulteration

**Carbon-14 Testing:**
- See if oil is synthetic (fossil-derived would lack C-14)

### Quality Issues Reported

**Historical Problems:**
- Few published reports of adulteration
- Rosemary too cheap to bother usually
- 1990s instance: Some "rosemary oil" was largely turpentine (pinene) with added cineole
- Unscrupulous supplier issue

**Current Risk:**
- Major essential oil brands now test thoroughly

**Powdered Capsules:**
- Risk: Mislabeling
- Using cheaper herb (Spanish Sage - Salvia lavandulifolia) sold as rosemary
- Spanish sage has similar smell but different herb (though also beneficial for memory)
- Trust companies with botanical identity via DNA or macroscopy

### Patient Guidance on Purchasing

#### For Dried Herb

**Buying Tips:**
- Get from trusted herb shop if bulk
- Leaves should look green and smell strongly
- Organic ideally
- Packaged tea: Should be just rosemary, no weird additives (unless intentional blend)

#### For Supplements

**Selection Criteria:**
- Look for brands mentioning part ("leaf")
- Extraction ratio or standardization specified
- GMP compliance indicated
- Avoid "proprietary blends" where rosemary is one of many but amounts not listed (dose could be negligible)

#### For Essential Oil

**Quality Indicators:**
- Should be 100% pure Rosmarinus officinalis or Salvia rosmarinus oil
- Check Latin name and country of origin
- If specific chemotype needed: Look for labels like "ct. cineole" or "ct. verbenone"

**Price Indicator:**
- Very cheap oils suspect (e.g., $5 for 50 mL when typical is $10-15 for 15 mL)
- Suspect adulteration

**Quality Checks:**
- Check expiry on oils
- Smell test: If smells off (harsh or plastic-like), could be oxidized or adulterated

## Executive Summary

**Context:** Rosemary is an aromatic Mediterranean herb traditionally used for memory, digestion, and circulatory ailments.

**Clinical TL;DR:** Rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis) demonstrates evidence-based benefits for cognitive enhancement (Grade B), mood and anxiety reduction (Grade B), and hair regrowth in androgenetic alopecia (Grade B). At low oral doses (750 mg), rosemary improved memory speed in older adults (PMID: 21877951). Daily doses of 1 g/day reduced anxiety and depression when used as an adjunct to SSRIs (PMID: 29389474, 36343423). Topical rosemary oil showed comparable efficacy to 2% minoxidil for hair regrowth after 6 months (PMID: 25842469).

**Safety Profile:** Generally well-tolerated with mild side effects (GI upset, headache). High doses or concentrated essential oil can be neurotoxic (seizures). Contraindicated in pregnancy due to uterine stimulant effects (PMID: 25842469). Potential interactions with anticoagulants and CYP3A4 substrates require monitoring.

**Clinical Bottom Line:** Rosemary serves as a useful adjunct for memory support, mild mood symptoms, and hair loss management with a favorable safety profile when used appropriately. Culinary amounts or standardized preparations are recommended. Counsel patients on avoiding excessive or undiluted use, especially in at-risk populations.

**Study Evidence:** Based on 10 RCTs, 2 systematic reviews, 2 cohort observational studies, 1 case series, 8 laboratory/preclinical studies, and 4 traditional sources.

- Woody at base
- Multiple side branches
- Young stems green, maturing to brown-gray

### Leaf Structure

**Appearance:**
- Leathery texture
- Narrow, needle-like shape (2-4 cm long, 2-5 mm broad)
- Arrangement: Opposite on stems
- Upper surface: Deep green and glossy
- Lower surface: White-gray with dense woolly hairs
- Margins: Revolute (edges curl under)

**Organoleptic Properties:**
- Highly aromatic when crushed
- Scent: Camphoraceous, piney
- Taste: Bitter-pungent with slightly resinous quality (due to diterpenes and volatile oils)

### Flowers

**Structure:**
- Two-lipped (bilabiate), typical of mint family
- Size: Approximately 1 cm
- Color: Pale blue to lavender, sometimes white or pink
- Arrangement: Clusters (whorls) of 2-10 at leaf axils on upper branches
- Season: Peak flowering in spring and early summer; in warm climates can flower year-round
- Pollination: Rich in nectar, attracts bees and pollinators (source of rosemary honey)

### Fruit and Seeds

**Fruit Type:** Small brown nutlets (four per flower, typical of Lamiaceae)

**Observation:** Not commonly observed unless flowers are pollinated and left to mature. Rosemary is often harvested before significant seed set.

### Root System

**Type:** Fibrous root network adapted to dry soils

**Characteristics:** Older shrubs become well-rooted and highly drought-tolerant.

### Differentiation from Similar Plants

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Differs from thyme or savory by much larger, needle-like leaves

### Medicinal Parts and Harvesting

**Medicinal Parts:** Leaf and flowering tops (folium Rosmarini)

**Optimal Harvest Time:** Just as plants begin to bloom, maximizing volatile oil content in leaves

**Sustainable Harvesting:** Clipping branches (rosemary tolerates pruning well) and allowing regrowth. Wild populations are not generally endangered.

**Processing:**
- Aerial parts usually air-dried in shade to preserve volatile oils
- Dried rosemary leaf: green-gray and very aromatic
- Volatile oil content: 1-2% in dry leaf (varies by chemotype and growing conditions)

### Active vs Inactive Parts

**Active Parts:**
- Leaves: Contain bulk of volatile oils and polyphenols
- Flowers: Similar chemical profile to leaves
- Combined aerial parts: Optimal for medicinal preparations

**Inactive Parts:**
- Stems: Generally considered inert filler (contain some volatile oil in cortex)
- Berries/nuts: Not used medicinally

**Essential Oil:** Distilled from leaves and flowering tops (Rosmarini aetheroleum)

### Clinical Identification Summary

Rosemary is unmistakable once familiar: woody evergreen herb with needle-like aromatic leaves and small blue bilabiate flowers. Only leaves and flowering aerial parts are used medicinally. Quality material should be green, fragrant, and free of excessive woody stem. Proper identification ensures potency and safety, as active volatile oils and diterpenes reside predominantly in foliage.

**Related Diterpenes:**
- Rosmanol, Epirosmanol, Isorosmanol
- Mostly artifacts of oxidation
- Found in smaller quantities
- Contribute to overall antioxidant capacity

### Phenolic Acids & Polyphenols

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- **Structure:** Caffeic acid ester (caffeic acid + 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid)
- **Concentration:** 0.5-2% in leaf (approximately 21 mg/g or 2.1% in dried rosemary)
- **Family:** Prevalent in Lamiaceae
- **Properties:**
  - Strong antioxidant
  - Anti-inflammatory (inhibits complement and lipoxygenase)
  - Mild anxiolytic
  - Neuroprotective (GABA-transaminase inhibition)
- **Clinical Significance:** Likely underlies nootropic and anxiolytic effects observed in human trials

**Caffeic Acid and Chlorogenic Acid:**
- **Caffeic Acid:** Released from rosmarinic acid upon metabolism
  - Antioxidant
  - Anti-inflammatory
- **Chlorogenic Acid:** Trace amounts (ester of caffeic and quinic acid)
  - Contributes to overall polyphenol content

### Flavonoids

**Major Flavones and Flavonols:**
- **Diosmin/Diosmetin:** May contribute to venotonic effects
- **Hesperidin:** Trace presence
- **Genkwanin (5,4'-dimethoxyapigenin):** Methylated flavone, weak estrogenic and anti-inflammatory activity
- **Cirsimaritin (4'-methoxyapigenin):** Methylated flavone
- **Kaempferol, Quercetin:** Minor levels as free or glycosides

**Function:** Collectively offer antioxidant benefits and work synergistically with rosmarinic acid and diterpenes.

### Triterpenes

**Location:** Present in leaf wax

**Ursolic Acid:**
- **Concentration:** 0.5-4% of dry weight
- **Location:** Leaf surface (waxy cuticle)
- **Structure:** Pentacyclic triterpene
- **Properties:**
  - Anti-inflammatory (COX-2 inhibitor)
  - Hepatoprotective
  - Metabolic effects (studied for anti-cancer)
- **Solubility:** Not very water-soluble, captured by alcoholic extracts

**Oleanolic Acid:**
- **Relationship:** Isomer of ursolic acid
- **Concentration:** Lower than ursolic acid in rosemary

**Betulinic Acid:**
- **Concentration:** Trace amounts
- **Clinical Relevance:** Very low

**Effects:** Contribute to anti-inflammatory effects, especially in high-dose extracts. Add to rosemary's bitterness.

### Other Constituents

**Tannins:**
- Modest content due to rosmarinic and other polyphenols
- Astringency noticeable in strong decoctions

**Resins:**
- Small resinous fraction including diterpene polymers
- Contributes to herb preservation (antimicrobial sticky resin on leaves)

**Fiber and Minerals:**
- Contains fiber and minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium) in dried herb
- Not typically therapeutically relevant unless consuming large culinary quantities

**Notably Absent:**
- No significant alkaloids (no major CNS addictive compounds)
- No significant coumarins (not phototoxic unlike rue or bergamot)

### Standardization Markers

**Pharmacopoeial Standards:**
- Essential oil content
- Rosmarinic acid content

**European Pharmacopoeia:**
- Minimum essential oil percentage required in Rosmarini folium
- Ensures quality control

**Commercial Supplements:**
- ≥10% rosmarinic acid: For cognitive or mood products
- 5-20% carnosic acid: For antioxidant extracts
- Research reference: Rosmarinic acid measured as quality marker (e.g., 21.1 mg/g in depression RCT)

### Stability Considerations

**Volatile Components:**
- Can evaporate or degrade over time
- Storage: Airtight, away from light and heat

**Carnosic Acid:**
- Relatively stable but can oxidize to carnosol
- Interconversion preserves antioxidant capacity

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Can degrade or polymerize with moisture and heat exposure

**Storage Duration:**
- Well-dried herb retains potency: 1-2 years

### Chemical Synergy

**Multi-Component Benefits:**
- Volatile terpenes + non-volatile polyphenols create synergistic pharmacologic profile
- Terpenes like cineole enhance blood-brain barrier penetration of polyphenols
- Polyphenols may prolong terpene action through antioxidant protection
- Whole rosemary or full-spectrum extracts provide multifaceted effects:
  - Immediate aromatherapeutic effects
  - Longer-term antioxidant benefits

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary contains a robust phytochemical arsenal. The aromatic essential oil (cineole, camphor, pinene) provides acute effects including mental stimulation, bronchodilation, and rubefacient action. Polyphenols (carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, carnosol) offer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions. These constituents validate traditional uses:
- Rosmarinic acid and diterpenes support memory and mood
- Camphor/borneol explain external analgesic uses

Standardized extracts often focus on rosmarinic or carnosic acids to ensure efficacy. Both volatile and non-volatile fractions contribute to therapeutic outcomes, so the form used (tea vs. tincture vs. capsule vs. essential oil) influences which constituents and effects predominate.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Oral bioavailability: ~20-25% from herbal preparations
- Peak plasma levels: 0.5-1 hour
- Form: Often conjugated (glucuronides)

**Carnosic Acid:**
- Lipophilic
- Better absorbed with fats
- May accumulate in fatty tissues or brain (animal models)

**Volatile Components:**
- Example: Cineole
- Rapidly absorbed
- Crosses blood-brain barrier
- Inhalation produces measurable plasma cineole
- Correlates with cognitive effects

#### Distribution

**Polyphenols (Rosmarinic Acid):**
- Distribute in plasma bound to albumin
- Enter tissues with high perfusion
- Some CNS crossing (trace amounts detected in rodent brains)

#### Metabolism

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Via glucuronidation and sulfation (phase II)
- Yields urinary glucuronides of:
  - Caffeic acid
  - m-Coumaric acid

**Carnosic Acid:**
- Phase I metabolism in liver (hydroxylation)
- Can convert to carnosol and other diterpene metabolites

**1,8-Cineole:**
- Mainly oxidized by CYP3A to hydroxycineole
- Then conjugated

#### Elimination

**Rosmarinic and Caffeic Acid Metabolites:**
- Mostly excreted in urine within 24 hours

**Essential Oil Components:**
- Exhaled (breath smells of rosemary)
- Renally excreted after conjugation
- No significant bioaccumulation with moderate daily intake

#### Half-life

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Plasma half-life: ~1-2 hours (rapid metabolism)
- Effects (enzyme induction) may last longer

**Cineole:**
- Plasma half-life: ~1.5-3 hours

### CYP Interactions

**Important Findings:**

**Carnosic Acid and Carnosol:**
- In vitro effects:
  - Induce CYP1A1
  - Inhibit CYP3A4
- Dual effect might shift estrogen metabolism
  - Less 16α-hydroxylation
  - More 2-hydroxylation
- Clinical significance not confirmed
- Suggests caution with narrow-index CYP3A4 drugs
- Could potentially raise levels by inhibition
- In vivo evidence scant

**Rosmarinic Acid:**
- Did not strongly inhibit major CYPs in one study
- Showed potential inhibition at high concentrations:
  - CYP2C9
  - Some UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
- Unlikely to cause interactions at dietary doses
- High-dose extracts theoretically could cause interactions

**Essential Oil Components:**
- 1,8-Cineole can induce liver enzymes (phase II glutathione enzymes) in animals
- Overall considered relatively low risk for PK interactions at normal doses
- Inhalation study: Rosemary oil showed mild enzyme induction in rats
- Case: Patient on CYP3A4-metabolized anti-epileptic using daily rosemary aromatherapy
  - No seizure medication level changes
  - Systematic data lacking

### Hormonal & Miscellaneous Effects

**Estrogenic Activity:**
- Mild estrogenic activity from rosemary flavones (like genkwanin)
- Bind weakly to estrogen receptors
- Simultaneously: Carnosol inhibits estrogen binding in breast cancer cells
- Acts as phytoestrogen or anti-estrogen depending on context
- Net human effect probably minimal
- Might slightly support menopausal symptom relief with other herbs

**Memory Consolidation and Cerebral Blood Flow:**
- Animal studies demonstrate rosemary:
  - Increases cerebral circulation (BP uptick and brain artery vasodilation)
  - Boosts expression of synaptic proteins
- Trial in older adults: Low dose improved memory speed
- High dose impaired memory
- Suggests inverted U-shaped dose-response

**Mechanism of Dose-Response:**
- Low doses: Optimize neurotransmission and arousal
- High doses: Possible over-stimulation or slight toxicity impairing cognition
- Aligns with GABA antagonism by camphor at high levels

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary's pharmacological actions span multiple systems:

**CNS:**
- Stimulation and protection
- Cholinesterase inhibition
- GABA modulation
- Antioxidant neuroprotection

**Anti-inflammatory/Analgesic:**
- COX-2/LOX inhibition
- NF-κB suppression
- Opioid pathway modulation

**Metabolic:**
- Insulin sensitivity
- Enzyme induction

**Antimicrobial:**
- Volatile oil action

These mechanisms validate traditional uses:
- Memory enhancement: AChE inhibition and cerebral perfusion
- Digestive aid: Smooth muscle relaxation and bile stimulation
- Mood uplift: GABA and monoamine modulation
- Pain relief: Anti-inflammatory and central pathways

Safety implications:
- Camphor's neuroexcitation explains seizure risk if overdosed
- NF-κB inhibition suggests combining with immunosuppressants might not be problematic (generally mild)

Rosemary acts as a gentle "multi-target" herb, not hitting any single pathway with drug-like intensity but exerting synergistic mild effects across systems, yielding net therapeutic benefit for mild to moderate conditions.

## 6. Clinical Indications & Evidence Map

**Purpose:** Summarizes key clinical uses with evidence grading (A=strong, D=preliminary).

**Clinical Application:** Guides evidence-informed recommendations.

### Evidence Grading System

**Grade A:** None yet (no large multi-center trials or meta-analyses solely for rosemary)

**Grade B:** Supported by at least one moderate-quality RCT or consistent smaller RCTs
- Cognitive function
- Alopecia
- Dysmenorrhea
- Adjunct depression

**Grade C:** Limited human evidence, often one small trial or traditional use primarily
- Dyspepsia
- Anxiety in general population
- Arthritis topical use

**Grade D:** Theoretical or only preclinical evidence
- Dementia
- Cancer
- Immune support

**Grading Considerations:** Each grade weighs consistency and effect size. Rosemary's positive trials generally show moderate effect sizes in relatively small samples.

### Cognitive Enhancement (Memory, Alertness)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Patients with age-related memory decline or seeking mental "boost" (students, professionals) inquire about rosemary for cognitive enhancement.

#### Key Clinical Trials

**Pengelly et al. 2012 (PMID: 21877951):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=28, older adults (mean age 75)
- **Intervention:** Single-dose crossover comparing 4 doses of dried rosemary leaf (750 mg, 1,500 mg, 3,000 mg, 6,000 mg) vs. placebo
- **Duration:** Cognitive performance assessed over 6 hours
- **Results:**
  - Only lowest dose (750 mg) significantly improved memory speed vs. placebo (+15% cognitive processing speed; P=0.01)
  - Highest dose (6 g) impaired memory (slower recall, P<0.01 vs. placebo)
  - Intermediate doses: Mixed, non-significant trends
- **Interpretation:** Biphasic dose response (small amounts sharpen mind, excessive dulls it)
- **Safety:** No serious adverse effects, high dose caused subjective "mental fog"

**Nematolahi et al. 2018 (PMID: 29389474):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=68, young adults (university students)
- **Intervention:** 500 mg rosemary powder BID vs. placebo
- **Duration:** 1 month
- **Results:**
  - Significant improvement in self-reported memory (prospective memory score improved ~30% vs. placebo slight worsening; P<0.001)
  - Overall cognitive functioning improved
  - Reduced anxiety
  - Better sleep quality (sleep latency unchanged)
- **Measures:** Subjective, but consistency across cognitive and mood domains strengthens credibility
- **Safety:** No significant side effects; mild rosemary aroma burps in a few participants

**Aromatherapy Evidence:**
- Healthy volunteers: Inhalation of rosemary essential oil improved memory recall and alertness
- Moss et al.: Rosemary aroma significantly increased prospective memory and reaction times
- Correlation with serum 1,8-cineole levels
- Note: Very strong aroma could increase test-taking anxiety in one study

#### Mechanisms

1. **Cholinesterase Inhibition:** Cineole and terpenes improve cholinergic neurotransmission
2. **Nrf2 Antioxidant Upregulation:** Carnosic acid protects neurons from oxidative stress (relevant to aging brains)
3. **Cerebral Blood Flow:** Rosemary's hypertensive and vasodilatory effects may enhance brain perfusion transiently
4. **Anxiety Reduction:** In chronic use, indirectly improves cognitive function (less test anxiety = better performance)

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Age-related forgetfulness
- Mild cognitive impairment
- Exam preparation
- Patients with "brain fog"

**Key Principle:** More is not better – stick to ~750 mg dried herb or equivalent. Higher doses may backfire.

**Administration:**
- Oral: 750 mg dried rosemary leaf in morning OR 1 cup rosemary tea (1-2 g, steeped 5-10 min)
- Inhalation: Sniffing rosemary essential oil for 5 minutes before cognitive task
- Timing: Acute alertness within 1 hour; sustained memory benefits need daily use for weeks

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Acute alertness within hours
- Fuller memory clarity after several weeks of consistent use

**Monitoring:**
- Track forgetful episodes
- Monitor blood pressure (especially in hypertensives)

**Contraindications:**
- Severe cognitive impairment (insufficient evidence for dementia, Grade D)
- Should not replace standard care

**Patient Counseling:**
- Gentle tonic, not potent drug
- Avoid large doses/concentrated extracts for cognitive use
- Combine with brain exercises, adequate sleep

---

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Patients with mild anxiety or those on antidepressants seeking augmentation.

#### Key Clinical Evidence

**Anxiety/Stress in Healthy Subjects:**
- Student RCT (above): Rosemary 1 g/day
- Significant reductions in anxiety scores (HADS anxiety subscale down ~4 points vs. minimal change placebo, P<0.001)
- Students reported feeling more refreshed, less mentally fatigued
- Population: Everyday stress, not anxiety disorder

**Major Depression Adjunct (Azizi et al. 2022, PMID: 36343423):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=60, adults with MDD
- **Intervention:** Rosemary 1 g/day alongside SSRI vs. SSRI + placebo
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Results:**
  - Greater improvement in depressive symptoms
  - Mean BDI dropped: 32→17 (rosemary) vs. 31→24 (placebo), P<0.001
  - Significantly lower anxiety (HADS-A: 12→6 vs. 13→10, P<0.05)
  - Cognitive complaints improved only in rosemary group
- **Safety:** No significant side effects or dropout differences

**Mechanistic Support:**
- Animal models: Rosemary has antidepressant-like effects via:
  - Reducing neuro-inflammation (lower IL-6 in brain)
  - Modulating monoamines (might mildly inhibit MAO-A enzyme, increasing serotonin)
- Human trials: Improved sleep quality (can itself improve mood)

**Aromatherapy for Anxiety:**
- Small studies and anecdote support using rosemary essential oil in blends
- Trial in dialysis patients: Inhaling lavender-rosemary reduced anxiety and pulse
- Note: Pure rosemary aroma can sometimes increase alertness in way that feels like anxiety
- Context matters: For relaxation, rosemary better used with calming oils
- Alone: More energizing than tranquilizing

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Subthreshold anxiety
- Depressed mood (adjunctive)
- Stressed individuals with mental fatigue
- Patients tapering off conventional anxiolytics

**Not a Stand-alone Treatment For:**
- Major anxiety disorder
- Major depression (use as adjunct only)

**Administration:**
- 500 mg dried rosemary leaf capsule BID (morning and early afternoon)
- Effects on anxiety: Noticeable within 2-4 weeks
- For situational anxiety: Combine with lavender via inhalation (2 drops rosemary + 2 drops lavender on tissue, inhale 5 minutes)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Moderate effect size
- Better mood, less anxiety, better sleep
- Pattern: Low-risk option for stressed students, peri-menopausal women with mood swings

**Safety:**
- No serious concerns at 1 g/day
- Unlike kava: No sedation or cognitive dulling
- No dependence risk
- Might slightly raise BP (monitor in anxious hypertensive patients)

**Patient Counseling:**
- Not a miracle cure, moderate benefits
- If anxiety severe or impairing: Primary treatments (CBT, SSRIs) should not be replaced
- Rosemary is adjunct
- Can combine with conventional treatments under supervision

### Hair Loss (Androgenetic Alopecia)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Common condition with patients seeking natural alternatives to minoxidil/finasteride.

#### Key Clinical Evidence

**Panahi et al. 2015 (PMID: 25842469):**
- **Design:** RCT, n=100, young adults with AGA (50 per group)
- **Intervention:** Rosemary essential oil (undiluted, massaged into scalp) vs. 2% minoxidil lotion, daily
- **Duration:** 6 months
- **Results:**
  - 3 months: Neither group significant hair count change (expected lag)
  - 6 months: Both groups showed significant increase in hair count (~+15-20 hairs per 1 cm² area vs. baseline, P<0.05)
  - No difference between rosemary and minoxidil in efficacy
  - Scalp itching: Common in both but worse with minoxidil (38% vs. 16% at 6 months, P<0.05)
  - Other side effects (dandruff, oily hair): Similar and mild
- **Conclusion:** Rosemary oil equally effective as 2% minoxidil in mild-moderate AGA over 6 months, with less scalp irritation

#### Mechanistic Plausibility

1. **Improved Scalp Microcirculation:** Dilates small blood vessels, increases perfusion, enhances nutrient delivery to hair follicles
2. **5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibition:** Carnosic acid might weakly block DHT conversion in follicles (far milder than finasteride)
3. **Anti-inflammatory:** Reduces folliculitis that often accompanies AGA

#### Alopecia Areata Evidence

**Hay et al. 1998:**
- Essential oil blend (rosemary, thyme, lavender, cedarwood) vs. placebo oil
- Duration: 7 months
- Results: 44% essential oil group had significant regrowth vs. 15% control (P=0.008)
- Note: Multiple oils used, rosemary's distinct contribution uncertain

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Androgenetic alopecia (male/female pattern hair loss)
- Early or mild AGA
- Patients hesitant about conventional options
- Can be used in women with AGA (fewer medical options available)

**Application Method:**
- Mix ~5 drops pure rosemary essential oil in 1 teaspoon carrier oil (~2% dilution)
- Massage into scalp over thinning areas once daily
- Leave on: Several hours or overnight, then wash if desired
- Some incorporate into shampoo/conditioner (brief contact time, leave-on preferred)

**Duration and Expectations:**
- Minimum: 6 months continuous use needed
- No improvement at 3 months: Expected (hair growth lag)
- Initial shedding possible (follicles shift phase, similar to minoxidil)
- Regrowth: Modest (few hairs per cm² increase)
- Requires continuous use (like minoxidil, stopping may reverse gains)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Comparable to 2% minoxidil after 6 months
- Less side effects (itching)
- Set realistic expectations: Modest improvement, not full reversal

**Combination Approaches:**
- May combine with microneedling or low-level laser therapy
- Evidence on combinations not yet available

**Safety:**
- Dilute properly (avoid undiluted EO on scalp for prolonged periods)
- Avoid eye contact
- Pregnant women: Avoid (minimal systemic absorption expected, but err on caution)

**Patient Counseling:**
- Patience required: 6+ months
- Initial shedding: Reassure, encourage continuation
- Evaluate at 6 months: If no improvement, rosemary may not be effective for them
- Can be used alongside topical treatments under guidance

### Dysmenorrhea (Menstrual Cramps)

**Evidence Grade:** B

**Clinical Context:** Primary dysmenorrhea common among young women. Some prefer herbal remedies over NSAIDs.

#### Key Clinical Evidence

**Tahoonian et al. 2019:**
- **Design:** RCT, n=82, college students with primary dysmenorrhea
- **Intervention:** Rosemary capsules 250 mg TID vs. mefenamic acid 250 mg TID
- **Timing:** First 3 days of menstruation, for 2 cycles
- **Results:**
  - Pain scores (0-100 VAS):
    - Rosemary: 40.4→23.6 (41% reduction, P<0.001)
    - Mefenamic: 46.8→28.3 (39% reduction, P<0.001)
    - No significant difference between groups
  - Menstrual bleeding: Both groups showed slight reduction (~16% rosemary, 15% mefenamic)
  - Practical interpretation: Both improved pain from moderate to mild
- **Significance:** Rosemary matched NSAID efficacy (mefenamic acid is potent prostaglandin inhibitor)

#### Mechanisms

1. **Prostaglandin Synthesis Inhibition:** Rosmarinic acid/carnosol's COX-2 inhibition reduces menstrual prostaglandin F2α levels
2. **Smooth Muscle Relaxation:** Volatile oils act directly on uterine muscle to relieve spasm
3. **Menstrual Flow Effects:** Traditionally said to increase flow (emmenagogue), but study showed slight decrease in excessive bleeding (prostaglandin inhibition reduces heavy bleeding)

#### Comparison to Other Herbals

**Ginger:** Another well-studied herb for dysmenorrhea
- Shows ~48% pain reduction vs. ~22% placebo in some trials
- Rosemary's efficacy appears comparable in magnitude
- Hypothetical combination: Ginger + rosemary could address both inflammation and spasm (untested)

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Primary dysmenorrhea
- Patients seeking natural remedy
- Those who cannot take NSAIDs (allergy or ulcer risk)
- May also ease associated symptoms (menstrual headaches, digestive upset)

**Administration:**
- 250 mg dried rosemary leaf TID during menses
- Start: Onset of menses or one day before if cycles regular
- Duration: First 2-3 days of period (when cramps worst)
- Form: Capsules (standardized ~1-2% rosmarinic acid) OR tea (2 g in 150 ml, TID)
- Take with food (gentler on stomach than NSAIDs)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Pain scores should drop over 2-3 cycles
- Reduced reliance on rescue analgesics
- Monitor effectiveness: If insufficient relief, escalate therapy or add heat therapy

**Combination Approaches:**
- Can combine with conventional NSAIDs (no known contraindication)
- Or combine with other anti-spasmodic herbs (cramp bark)

**Safety:**
- Generally well-tolerated
- No major side effects reported in trial
- Women may appreciate avoiding NSAID side effects (gastritis)

**Patient Counseling:**
- Regular dosing during painful period, not just one dose
- If stomach upset: Take with food or use tea form
- Can drink rosemary tea if prefer (though sufficient dose via tea requires strong brew)
- Very severe pain: Combining with conventional NSAIDs possible

### Indigestion & Functional Dyspepsia

**Evidence Grade:** C

**Clinical Context:** Bloating, flatulence, upset stomach often managed with diet and OTC aids. Herbal carminatives traditionally used.

#### Evidence Summary

**Regulatory Recognition:**
- EMA community monograph recognizes Rosmarinus officinalis folium as traditional herbal medicinal product
- Indication: "Symptomatic relief of dyspepsia and mild spasmodic disorders of the GI tract"
- Based on longstanding use

**Indirect Clinical Evidence:**
- Multi-herb products containing rosemary have shown benefit
- Example: Iberis amara + caraway, chamomile, peppermint, rosemary (product "STW-5" or Iberogast)
- RCTs: Multi-herb formula significantly improved GI symptom scores vs. placebo (NNT ~3)
- Rosemary's specific contribution hard to isolate
- Provides spasmolysis and choleretic effect

**Anecdotal Evidence:**
- Rosemary tea after meals reduces gas and bloating
- Small Iranian trial (uncontrolled, n=20): Rosemary syrup before meals
- Most reported less fullness and pain
- Without control: Low evidence quality

#### Mechanisms

1. **Smooth Muscle Relaxation:** Volatile oils relax stomach and intestinal muscles
2. **Alleviates Cramps:** Relieves "knots" in stomach
3. **Choleretic Effect:** Increases bile flow (supports fat digestion)
4. **Carminative Effect:** Helps expulsion of gas
5. **Digestive Stimulation:** Bitter diterpenes stimulate digestive secretions

**Anxiety Overlap:**
- Many dyspepsia sufferers have anxiety/stress component
- Rosemary's anxiolytic effect might indirectly help stress-triggered dyspepsia

#### Clinical Recommendations

**Indicated For:**
- Mild functional dyspepsia
- Bloating, gas, spasmodic upper abdominal discomfort
- Particularly helpful when associated with stress or over-eating rich foods

**Not a Replacement For:**
- Evaluation of serious causes
- Alarm features (weight loss, GI bleeding) require investigation

**Administration:**
- **Infusion:** 1-2 g dried rosemary leaf in 1 cup boiling water, steep ~10 min (cover to retain volatiles)
- **Frequency:** 2-3 times daily (before or after meals)
- **Tincture Alternative:** 2-3 mL rosemary tincture (1:5 in 45% alcohol) before meals
- **Combination:** Often combined with other carminatives (fennel, peppermint)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduced gas and more comfortable digestion within days
- If no improvement in 1-2 weeks: Requires other interventions

**Safety:**
- Generally well tolerated
- Unlike peppermint: No known reflux-worsening effect
- As bitter: Stimulates acid, so GERD patients should monitor if tea triggers heartburn
- Caffeine-free: Good evening digestive

**Patient Counseling:**
- Gentle for "nervous stomach"
- May be especially helpful when dyspepsia associated with stress
- Should not replace evaluation for serious causes
- For typical IBS-like dyspepsia: Cup of rosemary-mint tea after meals is reasonable integrative approach

**For hair application:**
- Consistency crucial
- Daily routine (e.g., every night before bed)
- Don't expect changes for 3 months (manage expectations)

**For dysmenorrhea:**
- Start at onset of menses or one day before if cycles regular
- Continue for first 2-3 days when cramps worst

**For digestive issues:**
- Before meals: Bitters work best
- After meals: Acceptable for gas relief

#### Combining with Other Supplements

**Synergistic Combinations:**

- Animal studies: No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity
- Rosemary extract negative in Ames tests
- Chronic feeding in rats (up to 1% of diet):
  - No increase in tumors
  - Some reduction in spontaneous tumor rate (presumably due to antioxidant effect)

**Conclusion:** Long-term use of rosemary in moderate range considered safe

**Mediterranean Diet Context:**
- Regular rosemary consumption without ill effect
- Traditional dietary inclusion supports safety profile

### Organ-Specific Safety

#### Liver

**Assessment:** No hepatotoxicity seen
**Evidence:** If anything, hepatoprotective in animal models
**Lab Tests:** ALT/AST remained normal or improved in human trials
- NAFLD patients on rosemary: Lowered ALT from weight loss diet in both groups
- No extra spike from rosemary

#### Kidney

**Standard Doses:** Normal use fine
**High Doses:** Historical caution (see Contraindications)
**Positive Use:** Used in herbal diuretics (Canephron) without kidney harm
**Benefit:** May benefit microcirculation in kidneys

#### Central Nervous System

**Seizures:** Only in oil overdose scenario
**Cognitive Effects:**
- No impairment on chronic use
- Acute impairment at 6g dose: Dose-specific and transient
**Long-term:** No issues reported

#### Reproductive System

**Fertility:** No data on long-term fertility impact
**Theoretical:** Rosemary antioxidants might improve circulation (unlikely negative effect)
**Formal Studies:** Lacking

### Special Safety Considerations

#### Blood Pressure

**Effect:** Can raise BP slightly, especially with essential oil
**Context:** One trial giving rosemary oil orally TID noted increased systolic and diastolic BP in chronic hypotension
**Clinical Implication:**
- Hypertensive patients: Monitor with high-dose use
- Hypotensive patients: May benefit from improved BP

#### Pregnancy Safety

**Culinary Use:** Safe
**Medicinal Doses:** Caution advised
**Concern:** Historical abortifacient reputation
**Mechanism:** Can cause uterine bleeding in overdose
**Evidence:** Rosmarinic acid might have emmenagogue effect
**Guideline:** Do not prescribe rosemary supplements or oil to pregnant patients
**Context for Patients:** If pregnant patient drank cup of rosemary tea unknowingly
- Reassure: Very unlikely to cause harm
- Caution about regular or high amounts

#### Breastfeeding

**Small Amounts:** Acceptable in diet or tea
**High-Dose Extracts/Oil:** Avoid
**Rationale:**
- Components could pass into milk (lipophilic compounds)
- No studies confirm, but many compounds do transfer
- Strong taste might affect milk flavor (baby may feed poorly)
**Guideline:** Stick to culinary doses or low-dose tea, observe infant for unusual reactions

#### Children

**Age <5 Years:**
- Contraindicated: Internal essential oil use
- Risk: Camphor poisoning and reflex apnea
- Inhalation: Be careful, avoid in infants (menthol-like compounds can rarely cause laryngeal spasm)

**Age 6+ Years:**
- Weak rosemary tea for tummy ache acceptable (parental observation, small amounts)
- Concentrated preparations: Do not use

**Topical in Children:**
- Do not apply rosemary essential oil (even diluted) on babies or young children
- Particularly avoid nose/mouth area (risk of bronchospasm)

### Allergic Reactions

**Frequency:** Very rare

**Manifestations:**
- Contact dermatitis (topical)
- Hay fever (to rosemary pollen, rare)
- Documented cases exist but uncommon

**Anaphylaxis:**
- Wheezing
- Throat swelling
- Widespread hives
**Action:** Stop-and-refer scenario, may need antihistamines or epinephrine

**Cross-Reactivity:**
- Possible with other Lamiaceae (sage, basil, lavender)
- Not guaranteed

**Management:** If known hypersensitivity to rosemary or strong allergic history to mint family, avoid use. Testing possible (skin patch) but generally easy to substitute another herb.

### Patient Counseling for Side Effects

**Key Messages:**
1. Culinary amounts extremely safe
2. Concerns with concentrated forms
3. If starting supplement: Monitor for unusual symptoms in first week (headache, stomach upset)
4. Rare but forewarned

**Essential Oil Emphasis:**
- "Natural doesn't mean non-toxic"
- Small bottle contains huge herb equivalent
- Only use as directed topically
- Never ingest more than instructed
- Keep away from children (camphorated oil ingestion = pediatric emergency)

**Severe Reaction Protocol:**
- Difficulty breathing: Though allergic anaphylaxis to rosemary almost unheard of
- Discontinue and seek medical care

### Clinical Safety Summary

Rosemary is very safe for most people at usual doses. Minor GI or skin irritations are most likely side effects, generally easily managed. Serious adverse effects (seizures) confined to misuse/overdose of essential oil.

**Whole-Plant Therapy Advantage:**
- Does not have systemic toxicity potential of some isolated compounds or pharmaceuticals
- Reflected in benign clinical trial outcomes

**Key Safety Principle:**
- Proper dilution of essential oil
- Avoidance of extremely high doses
- Keeps rosemary well within safety zone

**Form-Specific Caution:**

**Clinical Application:** Differentiates absolute vs. relative contraindications with rationale.

### Absolute Contraindications

#### Allergy to Rosemary or Lamiaceae

**Status:** Absolute contraindication

**Details:**
- Known hypersensitivity to rosemary
- Rare but documented: Contact dermatitis or hay fever to rosemary
- Cross-reactivity possible with other mint family herbs (sage, basil, lavender)
- Not guaranteed but possible

**Testing:**
- Skin patch test for topical
- Supervised low-dose challenge for oral
- Generally easy to substitute another herb

#### Epilepsy or Seizure Disorders

**Status:** Practical contraindication primarily for rosemary essential oil (internal use)

**Rationale:**
- High concentrations of camphor can lower seizure threshold
- Certain essential oils (rosemary, sage, hyssop) traditionally advised against in epilepsy
- Pro-convulsant ketones concern

**What's Safe:**
- Herb (tea or capsule) in culinary amounts: Not known to trigger seizures
- Spice use normally: Fine

**What to Avoid:**
- Giving essential oil orally to anyone with seizure history
- Even aromatic use: Approach carefully

**Patient Context:**
- Epileptic patient wishes to use rosemary tea or spice normally: Fine
- Warn against concentrated extracts or oils

### Major Warnings and Relative Contraindications

#### Pregnancy

**Status:** Contraindicated in medicinal doses

**Safe Use:**
- Rosemary as spice: Safe during pregnancy (sprinkling on food)
- Occasional small cup of weak tea: Generally acceptable

**Not Safe:**
- High-dose rosemary (especially essential oil or strong tincture)
- Traditionally considered abortifacient and uterine stimulant

**Modern Evidence:**
- Rosemary oil can cause uterine bleeding in overdose
- Rosmarinic acid might have emmenagogue effect

**Clinical Guideline:**
- Do not prescribe rosemary supplements or oil to pregnant patients

**Patient Context:**
- If pregnant patient unknowingly drank cup of rosemary tea:
  - Reassure: Very unlikely to cause harm
  - Caution about regular or high amounts

**External Use:**
- Low concentration in cosmetic cream: Probably fine
- Many providers err on avoiding unnecessary essential oil exposure in pregnancy

#### Children (Especially <5 Years)

**Status:** Contraindicated internal use of essential oil

**Rationale:**
- Camphorated oils not to be given orally to young kids
- Risk: Camphor poisoning and reflex apnea
- Even inhalation (adding to steamer): Should be done carefully
- Typically avoided in infants (menthol-like compounds can rarely cause laryngeal spasm)

**Older Children (6+):**
- Weak rosemary tea for tummy ache: Can be given under parental observation in small amounts

**General Rule:**
- Do not use concentrated rosemary preparations in toddlers or infants

**Topical:**
- Do not apply rosemary essential oil (even diluted) on babies or young children
- Particularly around nose/mouth (risk of bronchospasm)

#### Severe GERD or Peptic Ulcer

**Status:** Relative caution

**Rationale:**
- Rosemary's bitter and aromatic oils stimulate gastric acid
- In active ulcer or severe reflux: Could aggravate symptoms

**Not Absolutely Contraindicated:**
- Some GERD patients tolerate carminative teas fine
- Monitor individual response

**Guideline:**
- If patient notices heartburn worse after rosemary tea or tincture: Discontinue

#### Iron-Deficiency Anemia

**Status:** Management consideration, not strict contraindication

**Rationale:**
- Tannins in rosemary (rosmarinic acid) could reduce iron absorption
- Similar to tea/coffee polyphenols
- If taken simultaneously with iron-rich meals or supplements

**Guideline for Anemic Patients:**
- Don't drink rosemary tea with iron pill or with iron-rich meal
- Separate by couple hours
- Not strict contraindication, just management point

#### Bleeding Disorders or Anticoagulation

**Status:** Relative caution

**Rationale:**
- Rosemary not strong anticoagulant
- In vitro: Mild antiplatelet activity
- No clinical bleeding events with rosemary reported

**Precaution:**
- Large amounts might (in theory) add slight bleeding risk in patients with:
  - Bleeding disorder
  - On warfarin

**Management:**
- Avoid concentrated extracts in such patients
- At least inform and monitor
- Topical use: Fine

**See Drug Interactions section for detail**

#### Planned Surgery

**Status:** Standard herbal guideline

**Rationale:**
- Theoretical antiplatelet effect
- Avoid herb-drug interactions with anesthesia (none known for rosemary, but routine caution)

**Guideline:**
- Advise discontinuing high-dose rosemary supplementation at least 1-2 weeks before elective surgery

#### Hypertension (Uncontrolled)

**Status:** Relative caution

**Rationale:**
- Rosemary can raise BP slightly (especially the oil)
- Someone with poorly controlled hypertension might see small increase

**Not Absolute Contraindication:**
- If patient's BP well-managed: Can use with monitoring
- If poorly controlled (e.g., 160/100): Focus on primary BP control rather than adding rosemary

**Management:**
- If patient insists on using (for memory, etc.): Use minimal effective dose
- Monitor BP regularly

#### Severe Renal Impairment

**Status:** Caution with essential oil

**Rationale:**
- No direct evidence rosemary harms kidneys
- Elimination of some constituents might be slower

**In Severe CKD (Stage 4-5):**
- Limit use of essential oil
- Herb itself in moderation: Fine
- Some CKD patients use rosemary as seasoning to replace salt (beneficial)

### Special Medical Conditions

#### Atrial Fibrillation or Tachyarrhythmias

**Concern:** High doses of stimulatory EO might increase heart rate or cause palpitations

**Guideline:** Avoid giving rosemary oil to these patients

#### History of Aspirin/NSAID-induced Bronchospasm

**Assessment:** Rosemary's salicylate content negligible

**Status:** Not contraindicated

**Note:** Doesn't have same issue as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease

#### Asthma

**Consideration:** Aroma of rosemary (like any strong odor) could trigger bronchospasm in some asthmatics

**Frequency:** Uncommon

**Mechanism:** Otherwise, rosmarinic acid actually anti-allergic (could help allergic asthma)

**No Direct Data:** But if patient notes smells trigger them, be careful with aromatherapy

### Use in Combination with CNS Stimulants

**Status:** Advisory rather than true contraindication

**Context:** Patient on amphetamines or other stimulants

**Concern:** Rosemary's cognitive stimulant property theoretically could add to jitteriness

**Guideline:** Caution combining with:
- Large amounts of caffeine
- Adderall
- Modafinil
- Other stimulants

### Warning Labels and Patient Education

**Label Recommendations:**

**Teas/Tinctures (Internal Use):**
- "Not for use in pregnancy or by individuals with epilepsy"

**Essential Oil Bottle:**
- "For external use only"
- "Do not ingest"
- "Keep away from children"
- "Dilute before use"
- "Avoid if pregnant or epileptic"

**General Patient Advice:**
- "Natural" doesn't mean any amount is safe
- Follow dosing guidelines
- If signs of overdose (severe vomiting, dizziness, convulsions): Seek medical help immediately

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary is broadly safe but requires specific precautions:

**Avoid High Doses In:**
- Pregnancy (traditional uterine stimulation concerns)
- Epilepsy (concentrated forms)

**Use Caution With Essential Oil:**
- Any vulnerable group (kids, pregnant, neuro conditions)

**For General Adult Patients:**
- Rosemary is fine
- Pay attention to context (e.g., don't add BP-elevating effect to uncontrolled hypertension without monitoring)

**Golden Rule:**
- Culinary amounts always acceptable
- Step up to supplement doses triggers these warnings

When in doubt, use rosemary in culinary amounts.

  - Phenytoin
  - NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)
- **Risk Level:** Unlikely at dietary doses

**CYP1A1 Induction:**
- Carnosic acid may induce CYP1A1
- Could theoretically affect estrogen metabolism (shift to less 16α-hydroxylation, more 2-hydroxylation)
- Clinical relevance unclear

### Pharmacodynamic Interactions

#### Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets

**Interaction Type:** Additive antiplatelet effect

**Mechanism:**
- Rosmarinic acid and polyphenols inhibit platelet aggregation
- Affects thromboxane synthesis and ADP-mediated aggregation

**Affected Medications:**
- **Warfarin:** Theoretical increased bleeding risk via dual mechanisms (CYP2C9 inhibition + antiplatelet)
- **Aspirin:** Additive antiplatelet effect
- **Clopidogrel (Plavix):** Additive antiplatelet effect
- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs):** Theoretical additive bleeding risk
- **Heparin/LMWH:** Theoretical additive effect

**Clinical Evidence:**
- No reported bleeding events with rosemary in literature
- Animal model: Chronic rosemary reduced experimental thrombosis without increasing bleeding time
- Effect considered mild

**Management:**
- **High-dose rosemary + anticoagulants:** Monitor for easy bruising, bleeding
- **Check INR more frequently** if patient on warfarin starts concentrated rosemary supplement
- **Culinary amounts:** Likely safe
- **Concentrated extracts or daily high-dose supplements:** Use caution or avoid

**Risk Assessment:** Low to moderate depending on dose

#### Antihypertensive Medications

**Interaction Type:** Possible opposing effects

- Increased cardiac output and vasoconstriction via camphor effect

**Affected Medications:**
- ACE inhibitors
- ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers)
- Beta-blockers
- Calcium channel blockers
- Diuretics

**Clinical Evidence:**
- Small trial: Rosemary oil orally TID increased systolic and diastolic BP in chronic hypotension
- Effect modest

**Management:**
- **Monitor blood pressure** if hypertensive patient starts rosemary supplement
- Modest dose (1-2 g herb/day): Unlikely to significantly counteract medications
- **Concentrated essential oil:** Avoid or use minimal amounts
- If BP increases: Reduce rosemary dose or discontinue

**Risk Assessment:** Low at standard doses

#### Hypoglycemic Agents (Diabetes Medications)

**Interaction Type:** Potentially additive hypoglycemic effect

- Sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide)
- Metformin
- DPP-4 inhibitors
- SGLT2 inhibitors
- GLP-1 agonists

**Clinical Evidence:**
- Open trial: Trend to lower fasting glucose with 4g rosemary/day
- No reported hypoglycemic episodes

**Management:**
- **Monitor blood glucose** when adding rosemary to diabetes regimen
- Watch for signs of hypoglycemia (shakiness, sweating, confusion)
- May allow reduction in medication dose (benefit, not harm)
- Coordinate with prescribing physician

**Risk Assessment:** Low, potential benefit

#### Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)

**Interaction Type:** Potentially synergistic (beneficial)

**Mechanism:**
- Rosemary may have mild MAO-A inhibition
- Modulates monoamines
- GABA-transaminase inhibition (anxiolytic)

**Affected Medications:**
- SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram)
- SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine)
- TCAs (amitriptyline)
- MAOIs (rare)

**Clinical Evidence:**
- RCT: Rosemary 1g/day + SSRI improved depression and anxiety more than SSRI alone
- No adverse effects reported
- No serotonin syndrome cases

**Management:**
- Generally considered safe combination
- May enhance antidepressant effect (beneficial)
- **With MAOIs:** Theoretical concern about serotonergic effects, but rosemary's effect mild
- Monitor mood improvement

**Risk Assessment:** Low, likely beneficial synergy

#### Sedatives and CNS Depressants

**Interaction Type:** Potentially opposing effects

**Mechanism:**
- Rosemary is mildly stimulating
- Could counteract sedative effects
- Paradoxically has anxiolytic properties (via GABA mechanisms)

**Affected Medications:**
- Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam)
- Non-benzodiazepine sedatives (zolpidem, eszopiclone)
- Barbiturates
- Sedating antihistamines

**Clinical Context:**
- Rosemary unlikely to cause dangerous interaction
- Might reduce sedative efficacy slightly
- One study showed improved sleep quality with rosemary (via anxiety reduction, not sedation)

**Management:**
- Monitor sleep quality and daytime sedation
- If patient reports insomnia on starting rosemary: Consider timing (use earlier in day)
- Generally safe, but note potential for reduced sedative effect

**Risk Assessment:** Low

#### Anti-seizure Medications

**Interaction Type:** Potentially antagonistic (concerning)

**Mechanism:**
- High-dose camphor from essential oil can lower seizure threshold
- Could theoretically reduce effectiveness of anti-epileptic drugs

**Affected Medications:**
- Phenytoin
- Carbamazepine
- Valproic acid
- Levetiracetam
- Lamotrigine
- All anti-epileptic drugs

**Management:**
- **Avoid rosemary essential oil** in patients on anti-seizure medications
- **Culinary use and tea:** Generally acceptable
- **Concentrated supplements:** Use caution
- Monitor seizure frequency if patient insists on use

**Risk Assessment:** Moderate to high with essential oil, low with herb

#### Immunosuppressants

**Interaction Type:** Theoretical interference

**Mechanism:**
- Rosemary has immunomodulatory properties
- NF-κB inhibition (anti-inflammatory)
- Could theoretically interfere with immunosuppression goals

**Affected Medications:**
- Cyclosporine
- Tacrolimus
- Sirolimus
- Corticosteroids
- Methotrexate (in rheumatoid arthritis doses)

**Clinical Evidence:**
- No reported cases of transplant rejection with rosemary
- Rosemary's immunomodulation is mild

**Management:**
- Generally safe, but inform transplant team if patient uses high-dose rosemary
- Monitor drug levels and graft function
- Culinary use: No concern

**Risk Assessment:** Low, theoretical

### Notable Absences

**What Rosemary Does NOT Interact With:**

**Vitamin K:**
- Unlike some greens, rosemary doesn't contain significant vitamin K
- No interference with warfarin via vitamin K mechanism

**Hormone Therapies:**
- Rosemary not significant phytoestrogen
- Weak estrogenic components unlikely to interfere with:
  - Oral contraceptives
  - Hormone replacement therapy
  - Tamoxifen or other SERMs

**Antibiotics:**
- No known interactions with common antibiotics
- Rosemary's antimicrobial effect doesn't interfere with antibiotic action

### Herb-Drug Interaction Summary

Rosemary has remarkably clean record with medications due to:
- Usually used in modest amounts
- Multi-component mild effects rather than single strong action

**Main Cautions:**
1. **Anticoagulants:** Monitor for bleeding (theoretical)
2. **Seizure medications:** Avoid essential oil
3. **Blood pressure control:** Monitor BP

**Pharmacokinetic interactions via CYPs:** Remain theoretical with any effect likely mild given rosemary's moderate potency and typical dosing.

### Herb-Herb and Herb-Supplement Interactions

#### Stimulatory Herbs

**Combinations:**
- Guarana
- Ephedra (no longer legal)
- Large amounts of green tea
- Ma huang

**Effect:** Could collectively raise BP or cause jitteriness more than either alone

**Management:** Monitor cardiovascular effects, reduce combined stimulant load if symptoms

#### Sedative Herbs

**Combinations:**
- Valerian
- Hops
- Passionflower
- Kava

**Effect:** Rosemary might counteract sedation slightly due to alertness-promoting nature

**Context:** If taken for anxiety, probably complements (valerian calms, rosemary lifts mood - reasonable combo)

#### Blood-Thinning Herbs

**Combinations:**
- Garlic
- Ginkgo
- Feverfew
- Turmeric (high doses)

**Effect:** Small additive platelet inhibition

**Management:**
- Usually fine
- If triple therapy (garlic, ginkgo, rosemary plus aspirin): Monitor for easy bruising
- Discontinue one or more if excessive bruising occurs

### Management Strategies

**1. Communication:**
- Always ask patients to list supplements
- Many might not mention rosemary (think of it as "just a spice")
- If warfarin patient loves concentrated rosemary tea daily: Need to know

**2. Monitoring:**
- When in doubt, monitor clinical parameter of interest:
  - INR for warfarin
  - BP for hypertensives
  - Blood sugar for diabetics
  - Drug levels if concern about PK interaction

**3. Spacing:**
- For possible PK interactions: Space dosing between herb and drug
- Reduces competition in GI absorption or first-pass metabolism
- Example: Take drug at least 2 hours apart from rosemary if worried about CYP3A inhibition in gut

**4. Documentation:**
- Document any suspected interaction
- Consider reporting serious ones
- Rosemary's profile safe enough that significant interactions might be publishable case reports due to rarity

### Clinical Summary

Rosemary rarely causes significant drug interactions. Most theoretical ones (slight anticoagulation, enzyme modulation) have not proven clinically consequential at normal doses.

**Exercise Caution:**
- High-dose rosemary in patients on critical medications:
  - Anticoagulants
  - Anti-seizure drugs
  - Immunosuppressants
- Either avoid or monitor closely

**For Most Patients:**
- On common medications (antihypertensives, SSRIs, diabetes meds)
- Rosemary can be integrated smoothly
- Understanding of mild tendencies (could modestly raise BP or lower glucose)
- Careful monitoring can catch issues

**Key Advantage:**
- Lack of reported major herb-drug interactions
- One reason rosemary considered gentle and compatible herb in multi-therapy regimens

## 12. Quality, Sourcing & Adulteration

**Purpose:** Addresses how to ensure high-quality rosemary products.

**Clinical Application:** Helps practitioners select reputable products and counsel patients on quality indicators.

### Preferred Botanical Source

**Official Herbal Drug:** Rosmarini folium from Salvia rosmarinus (formerly Rosmarinus officinalis)

**Quality Standards:**
- European Pharmacopoeia: May require minimum essential oil content (e.g., ≥1.2% v/w in dried leaf)
- High-quality dried rosemary characteristics:
  - Green color (not brown or gray, indicating oxidation or poor drying)
  - Highly aromatic when rubbed

### Geographical Sourcing

**Major Producers:**
- Morocco
- Tunisia
- Spain
- Italy
- Greece
- Turkey
- Eastern European countries (Albania, Croatia)

**Geographic Chemotype Variations:**

**Moroccan Rosemary:**
- Often high 1,8-cineole content

**Spanish Rosemary:**
- Can be high in camphor (especially wild from Southern Spain)

**Balkan Rosemary:**
- Often intermediate profile (Bosnia, etc.)

**Selection Guidance:**
- Any source fine for internal medicinal use
- If specific chemotype desired (like low camphor for gentler oil): Specify "cineole type rosemary essential oil"
- Often preferred in aromatherapy for safety (camphor limited <20%)

### Cultivation vs Wild-Harvesting

**Cultivation:**
- Widely cultivated organically in herb farms
- Consistent quality
- Reliable supply

**Wild-Crafted:**
- Can be superb quality (e.g., Moroccan hills)
- Must ensure sustainable harvest
- Rosemary abundant, not endangered (IUCN: Not evaluated, no conservation concern)
- Hardy, beneficial shrub
- Wild harvesting in moderation acceptable

**Supply Considerations:**
- Doesn't rely solely on wild stands
- Easy to grow, reducing pressure on wild populations

### Adulteration and Authenticity

#### Dried Herb Adulteration

**Status:** Not common

**Why:** Rosemary leaf distinctive in appearance and smell

**Possible Issues:**
- Powdered rosemary could be adulterated with inert fillers
- Cheap leaves (olive leaf, other herbs)
- Choose suppliers with botanical identity testing:
  - Microscopy
  - DNA barcoding

**Risk Assessment:** Low due to rosemary's low cost

#### Essential Oil Adulteration

**More Significant Concern:**

**Related Species:**
- Sometimes from Rosmarinus eriocalyx (now also Salvia rosmarinus)
- Not major issue taxonomically (similar composition)

**Common Adulterants:**
- **Eucalyptus Oil:** Rich in cineole, can mimic rosemary cineole chemotype
- **Synthetic Camphor or Borneol:** Added to increase content cheaply

**Detection Method:**
- GC-MS analysis detects adulteration
- Unusual ratios of cineole to alpha-pinene
- Presence of compounds not normally in rosemary
- Too much p-cymene or certain sesquiterpenes (belong to eucalyptus)

**Standards:**
- Essential Oil Association has ISO standards
- Cineole type should have specified X-Y% cineole range
- Deviations indicate adulteration
- High-quality vendors provide GC-MS reports

#### Extract Adulteration

**Rosmarinic Acid Spiking:**
- Companies might spike with pure rosmarinic acid from other sources
- Cheaper sources: Perilla or Prunella
- Not dangerous but misrepresentation

**Carnosic Acid Spiking:**
- Could be from lab-synthesized sources
- Rosemary is primary natural source
- Less common issue

### Contaminant Testing

#### Heavy Metals

**Risk Profile:**
- Rosemary does not hyperaccumulate heavy metals typically
- If grown in polluted soil: Could contain lead or arsenic
- Iranian study: Some wild samples had slight heavy metal content below WHO limits

**Standard Testing:**
- Reputable suppliers test for heavy metals
- Should be <2 ppm lead, etc.

#### Microbial Contamination

**Risk:**
- If not properly dried: Possible
- Rosemary's volatile oils are somewhat antimicrobial (helps prevent mold)

**Quality Control:**
- Proper drying and storage essential
- Certificate of analysis should include microbial testing

### Pharmacopoeial Quality Tests

#### Identification Methods

**Macroscopic:**
- Needle leaves with downy underside

**Microscopic:**
- Look for peltate glandular trichomes containing oil
- 8-secretory cells (hallmark for ID)

**Chemical Fingerprinting:**
- TLC or HPTLC
- Show spots for rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid
- Spray with FeCl3: Rosmarinic acid gives green-black spot

#### Assay Standards

**European Pharmacopeia:**
- May not require assay of actives for herbal substance
- Might have assay for essential oil content by distillation
- Example: Must yield ≥1.5 mL/kg oil

**Essential Oil Standards:**
- GC must meet certain profile
- Official standard example:
  - Cineole: 25-50%
  - Camphor: 5-15%
  - α-Pinene: 10-25%
  - Borneol: 1-5%
  - Limonene: 1-5%
- Off-profile suggests adulteration or wrong species

#### Contaminant Limits

**European Pharmacopeia Likely Sets:**
- Foreign matter: Max ~5%
- Moisture: <12%
- Ash: <10%
- Pesticide residues: Within legal limits (none if organic)
- Heavy metals: <2 ppm lead
- Aflatoxins: Specified limits
- PAHs: Specified limits

**Certificate of Analysis:**
- Reputable suppliers provide CoA with these specifications

### Certifications

**USP or NSF Certified:**
- Tested for content and contaminants
- Recommended for supplements

**Organic Certification:**
- Ensures no synthetic pesticide residues
- Rosemary often available organic
- Easy to grow without chemicals (pest-resistant due to oils)

**GC-MS Analysis:**
- For essential oils
- Often provided by aromatherapy suppliers
- Printout with peak percentages

**Religious Certifications:**
- Kosher/Halal if needed
- Many herbal products carry these

### Shelf-life and Storage

#### Dried Rosemary Leaf

**Storage Life:** 1-2 years if stored properly
- Airtight container
- Away from light and heat

**Quality Indicators:**
- Gradually loses aromatic potency (oils evaporate)
- Test by smell: If bland, time to replace
- Color fades to dull brownish: Replace

#### Tinctures

**Stability:** Quite stable in alcohol
- Alcohol preserves oils and polyphenols
- Can last 3-5 years easily
- Protect from evaporation

#### Essential Oil

**Shelf Life:** 1-3 years once opened
- Depends on storage
- Can oxidize (forming peroxides)
- Oxidized oil: May increase skin sensitization

**Preservation:**
- Can add antioxidant (drop of tocopherol)
- Extends shelf-life

**Storage Recommendations:**
- Amber bottles
- Tightly capped
- Not too old or rancid-smelling
- Oxidized oil might be more irritant on scalp

### Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing

#### Sustainability Status

**Conservation:** Rosemary not endangered
- Can grow invasively in some areas
- Supply robust

**Wild-Harvesting:**
- Ensure legal and sustainable
- Some countries (Slovenia) have quotas for wild herb picking

**Cultivated Sources:**
- Not labor-intensive at large scale
- Mostly machine harvested or small farm produced

#### Labor and Fair Trade

**Considerations:**
- North African rosemary might be wild-collected by rural communities
- Supporting via Fair Trade channels ensures fair pay
- Important ethical consideration

**Legal Harvesting:**
- Spain: Harvesting from national parks or communal lands requires permit
- Illegal collection might undercut local farmers
- Prefer suppliers with cooperatives or traceable sourcing

### Adulterant Detection Methods

**Laboratory Testing:**

**Microscopy:**
- If olive leaves adulterated: Different trichomes
- Absence of rosemary's hair pattern

**HPLC:**
- Quantify rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid
- If extract lower than expected or ratio off: Indicates filler

**Chiral GC:**
- Differentiate natural vs. synthetic camphor by optical rotation
- Ratio of borneol to camphor: Clue to adulteration

**Carbon-14 Testing:**
- See if oil is synthetic (fossil-derived would lack C-14)

### Quality Issues Reported

**Historical Problems:**
- Few published reports of adulteration
- Rosemary too cheap to bother usually
- 1990s instance: Some "rosemary oil" was largely turpentine (pinene) with added cineole
- Unscrupulous supplier issue

**Current Risk:**
- Major essential oil brands now test thoroughly

**Powdered Capsules:**
- Risk: Mislabeling
- Using cheaper herb (Spanish Sage - Salvia lavandulifolia) sold as rosemary
- Spanish sage has similar smell but different herb (though also beneficial for memory)
- Trust companies with botanical identity via DNA or macroscopy

### Patient Guidance on Purchasing

#### For Dried Herb

**Buying Tips:**
- Get from trusted herb shop if bulk
- Leaves should look green and smell strongly
- Organic ideally
- Packaged tea: Should be just rosemary, no weird additives (unless intentional blend)

#### For Supplements

**Selection Criteria:**
- Look for brands mentioning part ("leaf")
- Extraction ratio or standardization specified
- GMP compliance indicated
- Avoid "proprietary blends" where rosemary is one of many but amounts not listed (dose could be negligible)

#### For Essential Oil

**Quality Indicators:**
- Should be 100% pure Rosmarinus officinalis or Salvia rosmarinus oil
- Check Latin name and country of origin
- If specific chemotype needed: Look for labels like "ct. cineole" or "ct. verbenone"

**Price Indicator:**
- Very cheap oils suspect (e.g., $5 for 50 mL when typical is $10-15 for 15 mL)
- Suspect adulteration

**Quality Checks:**
- Check expiry on oils
- Smell test: If smells off (harsh or plastic-like), could be oxidized or adulterated

### Quality Assessment Table

| Parameter | Acceptable Standard | Red Flag |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Dried Leaf Color** | Green to gray-green | Brown, faded |
| **Aroma** | Strong, fresh, camphoraceous | Weak, musty, off-odor |
| **Essential Oil Content** | 1.2-2.5% | <1% (poor quality) |
| **Rosmarinic Acid** | 0.5-2% | <0.3% or not listed |
| **Heavy Metals** | <2 ppm lead | >5 ppm |
| **Microbial Count** | Within USP limits | High bacterial/mold count |
| **Essential Oil GC Profile** | Matches ISO standard | Significant deviations |
| **Price (EO, 15mL)** | $10-20 | <$5 (suspect) |

### Sourcing Trends

**Specialty Oils:**
- Wildcrafted rosemary essential oil from Corsica (verbenone chemotype)
- Pricey but unique
- For mainstream clinical use: Moroccan or Spanish rosemary suffice

**Environmental Considerations:**
- Steam distillation uses energy/water
- Encourage use of whole herb where possible (less industrial processing than isolated extracts or oils)

### Patient FAQs on Quality

**"Can I use rosemary from my garden / grocery spice jar?"**
- Yes for culinary and tea
- If fresh and aromatic, it's fine
- For medicinal strength: Freshly dried from garden or high-turnover spice jar good
- Ground rosemary in old spice rack might have lost potency

**"Is there difference between fresh and dried medicinally?"**
- Fresh: More intact essential oils (can be lost in drying)
- Dried: Concentrates some constituents (less water)
- Both can be used
- Dried easier for consistent dosing and storage
- For tea: Dried usually used
- Fresh could be used for tincture (some argue fresh gives brighter aromatic tincture)

**"What about rosemary extract as food preservative (E392) – can I take as supplement?"**
- Rosemary antioxidant (E392): Carnosic acid-rich extract used in foods
- Not standardized for rosmarinic acid or others
- Might be very high in diterpenes
- Fine in large amounts, might cause more burping or stomach irritation
- Food-grade safe, but as supplement not optimized for consistent human dosing
- Better to use products labeled for supplementation
