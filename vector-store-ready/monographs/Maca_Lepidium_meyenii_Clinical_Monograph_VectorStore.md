## Clinician TL;DR

- **Core role**: Non-hormonal **adaptogen** with best evidence for **male and female sexual function** (including **antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction**), **menopausal symptom relief**, and emerging data for **mood, energy, and endurance**.
- **Mechanism**: Primarily **central HPAG modulation** (hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal–gonadal), **monoamine and endocannabinoid signaling**, and adaptogenic effects; most trials show **no major change in serum sex hormones**, except with specific proprietary blends (e.g., Maca-GO®).
- **Evidence strength**:
  - **Male libido & mild ED**: Multiple RCTs at **1.5–3 g/day for 12 weeks** show improved desire and IIEF scores without androgenic lab changes.
  - **Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AI-SD)**: **3 g/day** improves ASEX/MGH-SFQ in SSRI/SNRI-treated men and women; 1.5 g/day generally ineffective.
  - **Menopause**: RCTs show reduced vasomotor and especially **psychological symptoms** at **3.3–3.5 g/day**; Maca-GO® 2 g/day can **raise E2/PGS, lower FSH**.
  - **Fertility**: Meta-analytic signal for better **sperm count/motility** at 1–3 g/day; no human pregnancy data yet.
  - **Performance**: Some trials show better **endurance/VO₂max**, others no effect on short, anaerobic performance.
- **Safety**: Short- to medium-term RCTs (up to 4 months) show good tolerability; main concerns are **product quality**, **heavy metals/adulterants (notably hidden sildenafil)**, and limited **long-term safety** in hormone-sensitive conditions.

---

## Mechanisms of Action (Clinically Relevant)

- **Neuroendocrine modulation**

  - Modulates the **hypothalamus** and HPAG axis, helping normalize GnRH and downstream gonadal function.
  - Explains improved sexual and menopausal symptoms **without large shifts** in serum testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH in healthy people.
  - In dysregulated settings (late-onset hypogonadism, perimenopause), may restore endocrine **homeostasis**, sometimes increasing endogenous E2/PGS (Maca-GO®).

- **Endocannabinoid and monoamine systems**

  - **Macamides** structurally resemble **anandamide** and may **inhibit FAAH**, increasing endocannabinoid tone (anxiolytic, pro-sexual, analgesic).
  - Modulates **serotonin and norepinephrine** signaling, aligning with antidepressant-like and pro-sexual effects in preclinical models.
  - Polysaccharides can influence **macrophage polarization** and gut-derived serotonin, implicating the **gut–brain axis**.

- **Phenotype-specific actions**
  - **Black maca**: Strongest preclinical evidence for **spermatogenesis and memory**.
  - **Red maca**: Better data for **mood/energy** and **prostatic** effects in animals.
  - **Multicolor blends** (e.g., Maca-GO®): Designed for **menopausal hormonal modulation and bone support**.

## Key Clinical Indications & Evidence

### 1. Sexual Health & Reproductive Function

#### Male libido & erectile function

- RCTs in healthy and mildly hypogonadal men:
  - **1.5–3 g/day gelatinized maca for 12 weeks**:
    - ↑ **self-reported sexual desire** versus placebo.
    - Improved **IIEF erectile function** scores in mild ED.
    - No significant changes in **testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, prolactin**.
- Interpretation: **B-level evidence** for mild ED and low libido via non-androgenic mechanisms.

#### Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AI-SD)

- Dose-finding pilot and controlled trials:
  - **1.5 g/day**: minimal or no clinical benefit.
  - **3 g/day maca root (often in divided doses)**:
    - Significant improvements in **ASEX** and **MGH-SFQ** scores.
    - Higher **remission rates** of sexual dysfunction vs lower dose/placebo.
    - Effects seen in both **men and women**, sometimes more pronounced in **postmenopausal women**.
- Clinical role: **Adjunctive** option when antidepressant continuation is necessary and PDE5 inhibitors are not tolerated/desired.

#### Male fertility (semen parameters)

- Small RCTs and meta-analyses:
  - **1–3 g/day** for **12–16 weeks**:
    - ↑ **seminal volume**, **sperm concentration**, **total sperm count**, and **motile sperm** in several studies.
    - Some trials show no effect on motility/morphology, reflecting product/phenotype variability.
- No published human trials yet demonstrating improved **pregnancy or live birth rates**.

---

### 2. Menopause, Mood & Cognitive Function

#### Menopausal symptom relief (non-hormonal maca)

- Postmenopausal RCTs using ~**3.3–3.5 g/day**:
  - Reduced **Kupperman’s Index** and **Greene’s Menopausal Score**.
  - Improved **hot flashes, night sweats, sleep, anxiety, depression, libido**.
  - **No significant change** in estradiol, FSH, LH, SHBG → supports **central/non-hormonal** mechanism.

#### Maca-GO® and hormone modulation

- Early postmenopausal women, **2 g/day Maca-GO® for 4 months**:
  - ↑ **estradiol** and **progesterone**.
  - ↓ **FSH**.
  - Improved vasomotor and psychological symptoms; trends toward improved bone density in some studies.
- Functions as a **tonic** to the HPO axis rather than exogenous hormone replacement.

#### Mood & energy

- RCTs in postmenopausal women and adults at varying altitudes:
  - Maca (often **3–3.5 g/day**, red phenotype favored) reduces **depression and anxiety scores** and improves **subjective energy**.
  - Red maca’s higher **GABA** content may underlie stronger mood effects.

#### Cognitive & neuroprotective effects (early)

- Human data: limited; some improvement in subjective cognition/performance in athletes.
- Animal data: black maca improves **learning and memory**, reduces brain oxidative stress, protects against **scopolamine-induced** deficits.
- Potential future role in **age-related cognitive decline** remains **exploratory**.

---

### 3. Physical Performance & Other Uses

#### Endurance and aerobic performance

- Human trials report:
  - **2 g/day extract for 2 weeks**: improved **40 km cycling time**.
  - **5 g/day black maca for 4–8 weeks**: improved **VO₂max, endurance, strength**, and lowered inflammatory markers and ammonia in some athlete cohorts.
  - **1.5 g/day micropulverized fresh maca for 60 days**: ↑ maximum speed and VO₂max (~10%).
- Effects appear more consistent for **aerobic/endurance and recovery** than for short-duration, high-intensity anaerobic performance.

#### Negative/neutral findings

- Male college basketball players:
  - **2 g/day gelatinized maca for 2 weeks**: no significant improvement in jump height, sprint ability, or other anaerobic metrics.
- Takeaway: ergogenic benefits are **context-dependent** and not universal.

#### Prostate, bone, altitude (emerging)

- **Red maca** in animal models:
  - Reduces **testosterone-induced prostate enlargement** without altering serum testosterone.
  - Appears to act downstream of **5α-reductase** and modulate inflammatory cytokines.
- **Bone health (Maca-GO®)**:
  - 4‑month studies show improved **forearm and spine bone density** and ↑ T-scores vs placebo.
- **High-altitude adaptation**:
  - Observational data associate long-term maca consumption with better **lower limb strength and reduced fracture** rates; early clinical work suggests improved energy/mood at altitude.

---

## Dosing & Administration

> Most clinical benefits appear after **8–12 weeks**; set expectations for a **gradual** effect.

- **Typical adult range**

  - **1.5–3 g/day** of dried **gelatinized or powdered root**, in 1–2 divided doses.
  - Up to **5 g/day** used in some LOH and performance trials.

- **Indication-focused patterns**

  - **Male libido/mild ED**: 1.5–3 g/day × 12 weeks.
  - **AI-SD**: **3 g/day** (lower doses ineffective).
  - **Semen quality**: 1–3 g/day × 12–16 weeks.
  - **Menopausal symptoms**: 3.3–3.5 g/day × 6–12 weeks.
  - **Maca-GO® menopause**: 2 g/day × 4 months.
  - **Endurance performance**: 2–5 g/day × 2–8 weeks.

- **Formulation and phenotype**
  - **Gelatinized**: better tolerated and likely more bioavailable for many patients.
  - **Raw powder**: closer to traditional use but more GI upset in some.
  - Match **phenotype** (black/red/mixed) to primary indication when possible.

---

## Safety Profile

### Overall safety

- Short- to mid-term RCTs (up to 4 months):
  - Mostly mild adverse events: **GI upset, bloating, loose stools, headache, insomnia**.
  - No consistent lab abnormalities (CBC, LFTs, kidney markers) reported.
- Traditional use suggests good tolerability, but **robust long-term safety data are lacking**.

### Hormone-sensitive conditions

- Generic maca products:
  - Minimal direct estrogenic or androgenic effects in trials (labs unchanged).
- Maca-GO®:
  - Can **raise estradiol and progesterone and lower FSH**.
- Clinical approach:
  - In **hormone-sensitive cancers** (breast, endometrial, prostate), prefer non-hormonal maca and involve oncology; avoid hormone-modulating blends unless benefits clearly outweigh theoretical risks.

### Special populations

- **Pregnancy & lactation**: Insufficient evidence → generally **avoid**.
- **Children/adolescents**: Use only with specialist input; evidence sparse.
- **Psychiatric populations**: Co-administered with SSRIs/SNRIs in AI-SD trials without major safety issues; monitor for **agitation or insomnia**.

---

## Herb–Drug & Herb–Supplement Interactions

- **Intrinsic interactions**

  - No consistent clinical signal of serious **CYP-mediated** interactions; some preclinical work suggests **CYP1A2 modulation**.
  - Has been used with **SSRIs/SNRIs** without destabilizing mood or inducing serotonin syndrome in trials.
  - Practical risk currently appears **low**, but:
    - Exercise caution with narrow-index **CYP1A2** substrates until human PK data are available.

- **Adulteration-driven interactions**

  - Major concern: some “Peru Maca” and sexual-enhancement products contain **undeclared sildenafil** or analogues.
  - Risks:
    - Severe hypotension with **nitrates**.
    - Additive hypotension with **alpha-blockers** and antihypertensives.
    - Typical PDE5 adverse events (headache, flushing, visual changes).

- **Clinical pragmatics**
  - Ask specifically about **brand and source** of maca.
  - Consider hidden PDE5s if dramatic, rapid-onset erectile improvements occur at low “maca” doses, or if PDE5-type adverse effects appear.

---

## Quality, Standardization & Adulteration

- **Key variability drivers**

  - **Phenotype (color)**, altitude, soil, and post-harvest **drying/processing** markedly influence macamide and glucosinolate content.
  - Gelatinization and other industrial processes can change the active profile.

- **Analytical and authentication tools**

  - HPLC/UPLC-based methods quantify intact **glucosinolates** and support phenotype identity (e.g., glucotropaeolin:glucolimnanthin ratio).
  - LC-MS/UPLC-TQD quantifies **macamides, macaenes, and alkaloids** to assess potency and detect adulteration.
  - **NMR/NIR** differentiate authentic maca from fillers (soy, maize) and verify phenotype.
  - Heavy metal testing is critical due to potential **Cd, Pb, As, Hg** contamination in certain growing regions.

- **Pharmaceutical adulterants**

  - Regulatory reports (e.g., FDA) have identified **sildenafil** in products marketed as “Peru Maca”.
  - This transforms the product into an **unlabeled drug** and must be treated as such from a risk perspective.

- **Clinician guidance**
  - Recommend brands with:
    - Transparent **phenotype**, origin, and processing information.
    - Third-party **CoAs** for identity, potency, heavy metals, microbes, and pharmaceuticals.
  - Discourage purchasing “performance” maca from **unverified online vendors**.

---

## Red Flags & Triage

- **Stop maca and evaluate** if:

  - New or worsening **hormone-sensitive cancer symptoms** (breast changes, abnormal uterine bleeding, prostate symptoms).
  - Signs consistent with **PDE5 use** (sudden visual changes, hypotension, severe headache) in a patient on “maca” alone.
  - Significant GI intolerance or allergic reactions.

- **Use extra caution** in:
  - Patients on **nitrates or complex cardiac regimens** (due to potential hidden PDE5s).
  - Patients already on **HRT/BHRT** (consider additive hormonal impact with Maca-GO®).
  - Cases where small changes in CYP1A2 activity might be critical.

---

## Practical IF/THEN/BECAUSE Rules

- **IF** a patient on SSRIs/SNRIs has persistent sexual dysfunction but wants to stay on their antidepressant,  
  **THEN** consider **3 g/day** of a high-quality, non-hormonal maca preparation for **8–12 weeks**,  
  **BECAUSE** this dose has RCT support for improving sexual function scores without destabilizing mood or requiring antidepressant changes.

- **IF** a eugonadal man with mild ED/low libido prefers a botanical option or cannot use PDE5 inhibitors,  
  **THEN** offer a trial of **1.5–3 g/day maca** for 12 weeks while addressing sleep, stress, and relationship factors,  
  **BECAUSE** maca demonstrates B-level evidence for improving libido and mild erectile function via central, non-androgenic pathways.

- **IF** a peri/postmenopausal woman has distressing mood and moderate vasomotor symptoms but declines HRT,  
  **THEN** consider **3.3–3.5 g/day maca powder** or **2 g/day Maca-GO®** with informed consent and oncologic review if at high cancer risk,  
  **BECAUSE** RCTs show symptom relief and, for Maca-GO®, modest normalization of E2/PGS/FSH and potential bone benefits.

- **IF** a patient presents with unexpected hypotension or classic PDE5 side effects while using “maca” for sexual enhancement,  
  **THEN** suspect hidden **sildenafil** or similar drugs and stop the product,  
  **BECAUSE** adulteration is documented and can cause dangerous interactions and misattribution of adverse events.

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Core role**: Maca is a **non-hormonal adaptogen** with best evidence for **male and female sexual function** (including **antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction**) and **menopausal symptom relief**, plus emerging data for **mood, energy, and endurance performance**.
- **Mechanism**: Acts primarily via **central modulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal–gonadal (HPAG) axis**, **monoamine and endocannabinoid signaling**, and adaptogenic effects rather than direct sex-hormone replacement; most trials show **no major changes in serum testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH** except with specific proprietary blends (e.g., Maca-GO®).
- **Evidence strength**:
  - **Male libido and mild ED**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show improved sexual desire and erectile function at **1.5–3 g/day for ~12 weeks**, without androgenic lab changes.
  - **Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AI-SD)**: High-dose **3 g/day** improves ASEX/MGH-SFQ scores in both men and women on SSRIs/SNRIs; 1.5 g/day is usually inadequate.
  - **Menopausal symptoms**: Several RCTs show reduced vasomotor and especially **psychological symptoms** (anxiety, depression, sleep) at **3.3–3.5 g/day**, largely **non-hormonal**; Maca-GO® at **2 g/day** over 4 months increases **E2/PGS and lowers FSH**.
  - **Fertility and semen quality**: Meta-analytic signal for ↑ sperm count and motility at **1–3 g/day for ≥12 weeks**, but no human data yet on **pregnancy/live birth**.
  - **Performance**: Mixed; some trials show better **endurance and VO₂max**, others show no benefit for short, anaerobic efforts.
- **Safety**: Generally well-tolerated in short–medium term RCTs (12–16 weeks). Main concerns are:
  - **Product quality** (heavy metals from high-altitude regions, microbial load, phenotype mislabeling).
  - **Adulteration**, notably undeclared **sildenafil** in some “Peru Maca” products.
  - **Limited long-term safety data** and uncertainty in **hormone-sensitive cancers**.
- **Use when**: Patient prefers a **non-hormonal option** for libido, AI-SD, or menopausal mood symptoms, and is willing to use a **high-quality, phenotype-specified product** consistently for ≥8–12 weeks.

---

## Mechanisms of Action (Clinically Relevant)

- **Adaptogenic & neuroendocrine modulation**

  - Acts centrally on the **hypothalamus and pituitary**, modulating GnRH and downstream HPAG tone without substantially changing resting sex hormone levels in most healthy subjects.
  - In dysregulated states (LOH, perimenopause), maca appears to **normalize** rather than increase hormones beyond normal ranges; Maca-GO® specifically has been shown to **raise estradiol and progesterone and lower FSH** in early postmenopausal women.

- **Neurotransmitter and endocannabinoid systems**

  - **Macamides** structurally resemble **anandamide**; preclinical data suggest **FAAH inhibition → ↑ anandamide**, contributing to **mood, stress resilience, analgesia, and libido**.
  - Modulates **serotonergic and noradrenergic** transmission, aligning with antidepressant-like and pro-sexual effects in animal models.
  - May support the **gut–brain axis** via polysaccharide-mediated immune modulation and changes in gut serotonin metabolism.

- **Endocrine and enzyme modulation**

  - Some network pharmacology work suggests certain macamides (e.g., NBH) **inhibit CYP1A2**, theoretically preserving DHEA for androgen synthesis; this remains mostly preclinical.
  - Phytosterols may contribute modestly to **membrane and receptor-level effects**, but maca is **not a phytoestrogen** in the sense of soy/isoflavones.

- **Phenotype specificity**
  - **Black maca**: Best preclinical signal for **spermatogenesis and memory**.
  - **Red maca**: Stronger data for **mood, energy**, and **prostate** protection in animals.
  - **Blends (e.g., Maca-GO®)**: Designed for **menopausal hormone modulation and bone density**.

### 2. Menopause, Mood & Cognitive Function

#### Menopausal symptom relief (non-hormonal formulations)

- Trials using powdered maca (~3.3–3.5 g/day for 6–12 weeks) in peri- and postmenopausal women:
  - Significant reductions in **Kupperman and Greene scores** (vasomotor and psychological symptoms).
  - Specific improvements in **hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbance, nervousness, depression, loss of libido**.
  - Most of these studies show **no change** in E2, FSH, LH, or SHBG → supports **central/non-hormonal** mechanism (monoamine, HPAG).

#### Maca-GO® and hormone modulation

- Proprietary blend (multi-color maca) **2 g/day** for 4 months:
  - Early postmenopausal women:
    - ↑ **estradiol and progesterone**.
    - ↓ **FSH**.
    - Improvements in vasomotor and psychological symptoms and quality of life.
  - Suggests a **tonic effect on the HPO axis** rather than direct hormone replacement.

#### Mood and energy

- RCTs in postmenopausal women:
  - **3.3–3.5 g/day** reduced **depression and anxiety scores** compared with placebo.
- In adults at low and high altitude:
  - **3 g/day red maca** > black maca and placebo for improving **mood, energy, and wellbeing scores**.
  - Red maca’s higher **GABA content** may underpin these effects.

#### Cognitive function and neuroprotection

- Human data: limited but suggest improved **subjective cognition and performance** in athletes.
- Animal data:
  - Black maca improves **learning and memory**, reduces oxidative stress markers, and protects against **scopolamine-induced memory impairment**.

  - Suggests maca may be helpful for **aerobic endurance and recovery**, more than short anaerobic performance.

#### Negative/neutral performance findings

- In male college basketball players:
  - **2 g/day gelatinized maca for 2 weeks**:
    - No significant improvements in jump height, sprint ability, or anaerobic measures.
  - Indicates ergogenic effects are **not universal** and may be context- and protocol-dependent.

#### Prostate, bone, and high-altitude adaptation (early data)

- **Red maca** in animal models:
  - Reduces **testosterone-induced prostate enlargement** without altering serum testosterone.
  - Appears to act **downstream of 5α-reductase** and modulate inflammatory cytokines (↑ IFN-γ, ↓ TNF-α).
  - No human RCTs yet for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- **Bone density** (Maca-GO®):
  - Small trials in postmenopausal women show **improved forearm and overall bone density** and ↑ T-scores vs placebo over 4 months.
- **High altitude and chronic mountain sickness**:
  - Observational and small trials suggest traditional maca use may support **energy, mood, and musculoskeletal health** at altitude, but evidence is preliminary.

---

## Dosing & Administration

> Typical clinical trial durations are **8–16 weeks**; many benefits are **cumulative**, not immediate.

- **General adult dosing ranges**

  - **1.5–3 g/day** of dried **gelatinized or powdered maca** in divided doses.
  - Higher doses **up to 5 g/day** used in some performance and LOH studies.

- **Indication-specific patterns (from trials)**

  - **Male libido/mild ED**: 1.5–3 g/day for **12 weeks**.
  - **AI-SD (men & women)**: **3 g/day**; lower doses generally ineffective.
  - **Semen quality**: 1–3 g/day for **12–16 weeks**.
  - **Menopausal symptoms (non-hormonal)**: 3.3–3.5 g/day for **6–12 weeks**.
  - **Maca-GO® menopause**: **2 g/day** for **4 months**.
  - **Endurance performance**: 2–5 g/day for **2–8 weeks** depending on study.

- **Formulation considerations**
  - **Gelatinized maca**: starch removed through heat/pressure → often **better digestibility/bioavailability**, but some heat-sensitive compounds may be reduced.
  - **Raw powder**: more complete phytochemical profile but can be **harder to digest**.
  - **Phenotype-specific products**:
    - **Black**: fertility, cognition, performance.
    - **Red**: mood, prostate.
    - **Blends (e.g., Maca-GO®)**: menopausal support (including hormone modulation).

---

## Safety Profile

### General tolerability

- RCTs up to **3–4 months** report:
  - Mostly **mild and transient** adverse events: GI upset, bloating, loose stools, headache, insomnia in some.
  - No consistent changes in **CBC, LFTs, or renal markers** within those time frames.
- Long-term daily use beyond 4–6 months is **common in traditional settings**, but modern data on chronic supplementation are limited.

### Hormone-sensitive conditions

- Most clinical trials with generic or non-hormonal maca products:
  - Show **no significant change** in serum **E2, testosterone, LH, FSH**, suggesting minimal direct estrogenic/androgenic activity.
- Maca-GO®:
  - **Raises E2 and progesterone and lowers FSH** in early postmenopausal women.
- **Implication**:
  - For **hormone-sensitive cancers (breast, endometrial, prostate)**:
    - Consider using **non-hormonal formulations** with close monitoring.
    - Avoid self-directed Maca-GO® or similar hormone-modulating products without oncology/endocrine input.

### Other safety considerations

- **Pregnancy & lactation**: Insufficient controlled data; best to **avoid** or use only under specialist guidance.
- **Children/adolescents**: Evidence very limited; reserve for research/specialist use.
- **Psychiatric comorbidity**:
  - Used in conjunction with SSRIs/SNRIs in AI-SD trials without major safety signals.
  - Theoretically may modulate **monoaminergic** tone; monitor for agitation or insomnia.

---

## Herb–Drug & Herb–Supplement Interactions

- **Intrinsic interactions**

  - No strong, consistent clinical evidence of dangerous **CYP-mediated** interactions, though:
    - Some preclinical data suggest **CYP1A2 inhibition** by specific macamides.
  - So far, maca has been co-administered safely with **SSRIs/SNRIs** in AI-SD studies.
  - Overall intrinsic interaction risk appears **low**, but caution is prudent with:
    - Narrow therapeutic index **CYP1A2 substrates** (e.g., certain psychotropics) until more human PK data exist.

- **Interactions via adulterants**

  - Serious issue: some “Peru Maca” products have been found to contain **undeclared sildenafil**.
  - This converts maca into a **hidden PDE5 inhibitor**, risking:
    - Dangerous BP drops with **nitrates**.
    - Interactions with **alpha-blockers** or other antihypertensives.
  - Always consider this when a patient reports strong **PDE5-like effects** from “maca” or develops typical Viagra side effects.

- **Practical approach**
  - For patients on critical polypharmacy (e.g., complex psychiatric regimens, antiarrhythmics):
    - Document maca use.
    - Monitor for unexpected changes in side effects or drug levels.
  - Explicitly screen for **over-the-counter “maca blends”** marketed for sexual performance, which are more likely to be adulterated.

---

## Quality, Standardization & Adulteration

- **Phenotype and origin**

  - Maca has multiple color phenotypes (**black, red, yellow, purple, etc.**) with distinct **phytochemical and pharmacologic profiles**.
  - Altitude and soil conditions influence **glucosinolate** and **macamide** content.

- **Processing**

  - Traditional **sun-drying** converts glucosinolates to isothiocyanates and shapes the macamide profile.
  - **Gelatinization** improves digestibility but may alter some thermolabile compounds.
  - Lack of standardized processing across manufacturers → **large potency variability** between products labeled “gelatinized black maca,” etc.

- **Analytical markers**

  - Glucosinolates (e.g., **glucotropaeolin : glucolimnanthin ratio ~1 : 0.19**) can fingerprint authentic Peruvian maca.
  - LC-MS/UPLC methods quantify **macamides, macaenes, and key alkaloids** to support standardization.
  - NMR and NIR can detect **adulteration with soy, maize, or other fillers**.
  - Heavy metals (Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Ni) require testing due to possible **mining-related contamination** in some Andean regions.

- **Adulteration with pharmaceuticals**

  - FDA and other regulators have found **sildenafil** and related drugs in some commercial “maca” products marketed for sexual enhancement.
  - This is a major **safety and liability concern** and a key reason to insist on trusted brands and **third-party certificates of analysis (CoA)**.

- **Clinical guidance**
  - Recommend products that:
    - Disclose **species (Lepidium meyenii)** and **phenotype(s)**.
    - Specify **dose per serving** in grams of root equivalent.
    - Provide **third-party testing** for identity, potency, heavy metals, microbes, and **pharmaceutical adulterants**.

---

## Red Flags & Triage

- **Stop maca and reassess** if:

  - New/worsening **breast or pelvic symptoms** in hormone-sensitive cancer survivors.
  - Unexplained **palpitations, chest pain, or severe headaches** in a patient using “sexual performance” maca products (consider hidden PDE5 inhibitors).
  - Significant **GI distress or allergic reactions**.

- **Use caution / specialist involvement** if:
  - Patient has a **hormone-sensitive malignancy** (breast, endometrial, prostate).
  - Patient already uses **HRT/BHRT**; avoid Maca-GO®-like blends unless coordinated with prescribing clinician.
  - Complex polypharmacy where even modest CYP1A2 modulation could matter.

## Practical IF/THEN/BECAUSE Rules

- **IF** a patient on SSRIs/SNRIs has bothersome sexual dysfunction but wishes to stay on their antidepressant,  
  **THEN** consider **maca 3 g/day** of a high-quality, non-hormonal product for **8–12 weeks**,  
  **BECAUSE** this dose has RCT support for improving ASEX/MGH-SFQ scores without destabilizing mood or requiring antidepressant changes.

- **IF** a man with mild ED/low libido and normal testosterone prefers a “natural” option or has relative contraindications to PDE5 inhibitors,  
  **THEN** offer a trial of **1.5–3 g/day maca** for 12 weeks while addressing lifestyle and psychogenic contributors,  
  **BECAUSE** maca shows consistent B-level evidence for improved sexual desire and mild ED via non-androgenic mechanisms.

- **IF** a peri- or postmenopausal woman has bothersome psychological and moderate vasomotor symptoms but declines HRT,  
  **THEN** consider **3.3–3.5 g/day powdered maca** (or 2 g/day Maca-GO® with appropriate hormone-sensitive risk assessment),  
  **BECAUSE** RCTs show symptom reduction and, for Maca-GO®, modest normalization of E2/PGS/FSH.

- **IF** a patient buys unregulated “maca sex booster” products online,  
  **THEN** warn them that such products may contain undeclared **sildenafil** or other drugs and recommend switching to a **verified product**,  
  **BECAUSE** hidden PDE5 inhibitors can cause serious interactions with nitrates and antihypertensives and invalidate medication safety planning.

## High-Yield Evidence Pointers (for Retrieval)

- **Sexual health**

  - RCTs: **1.5–3 g/day** maca for 12 weeks improves **libido** and **IIEF** scores without changing sex hormones.
  - AI-SD: **3 g/day** improves ASEX/MGH-SFQ; 1.5 g/day ineffective.
  - Semen quality: meta-analytic evidence for ↑ count/motility at **1–3 g/day**, but no pregnancy data.

- **Menopause and mood**

  - Non-hormonal maca: 3.3–3.5 g/day reduces vasomotor and psychological symptoms **without hormone changes**.
  - Maca-GO®: 2 g/day increases **E2/PGS**, decreases **FSH**, improves symptoms and sometimes bone density.
  - Red maca: 3 g/day superior for **mood/energy** in altitude and general populations.

- **Performance & others**
  - Endurance: 2–5 g/day improves **40 km cycling time, VO₂max, and subjective performance** in some trials; no benefit for short anaerobic tasks in others.
  - Prostate: red maca reduces **prostate size** in testosterone-induced BPH models (no human data yet).
  - Bone: Maca-GO® improves bone density markers in small postmenopausal cohorts.
