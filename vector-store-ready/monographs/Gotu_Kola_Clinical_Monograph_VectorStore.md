## Pharmacology & Mechanism of Action

The therapeutic profile of _Centella asiatica_, commonly known as Gotu Kola, is rooted in a complex and multi-faceted pharmacology driven primarily by its rich composition of pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica)]. These bioactive compounds, including asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid, orchestrate a wide array of biological activities that underpin its diverse clinical applications [[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. The core mechanisms of action span across several critical physiological systems, including connective tissue remodeling, inflammation modulation, oxidative stress mitigation, and neuronal protection. Understanding these interconnected pathways is essential for contextualizing the clinical evidence and guiding rational therapeutic application.

A central pillar of _C. asiatica_'s pharmacology is its profound impact on wound healing and angiogenesis, a process meticulously orchestrated at the cellular level [[14](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/16/10/1252), [15](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Systematic-Review-of-the-Effect-of-Centella-on-Arribas-L%C3%B3pez-Zand/cf686e3a08e90c5778fd28187ef232b09debbc3e)]. The plant's extracts stimulate fibroblast proliferation and significantly enhance the synthesis of type I collagen, the primary structural protein in skin and other connective tissues [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [17](https://www.nrfhh.com/pdf-203178-125923?filename=125923.pdf), [35](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/2/276)]. This effect is mediated through the activation of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathway; specifically, asiaticoside has been shown to activate TGF-β receptor I (TβR1) kinase in a manner independent of Smad phosphorylation, leading to increased expression of procollagen type I and III [[17](https://www.nrfhh.com/pdf-203178-125923?filename=125923.pdf), [35](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/2/276)]. This mechanism translates into clinically observable improvements, such as increased tensile strength and hydroxyproline content in healing wounds [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037887419800141X)]. Madecassoside contributes to this process by promoting dermal fibroblast proliferation and enhancing angiogenesis [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834700/)]. Furthermore, the extract stimulates the production of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), key drivers of new blood vessel formation, thereby improving perfusion and nutrient delivery to the wound site [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328954/), [15](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Systematic-Review-of-the-Effect-of-Centella-on-Arribas-L%C3%B3pez-Zand/cf686e3a08e90c5778fd28187ef232b09debbc3e)]. In diabetic models, where impaired angiogenesis is a major barrier to healing, _C. asiatica_ has been shown to accelerate closure by enhancing granulation tissue formation and neovascularization [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [13](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1632573/full)].

The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of _C. asiatica_ constitute another fundamental mechanism, providing a protective foundation for many of its other therapeutic effects [[30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full), [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92958-7)]. The triterpenoids exert potent anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a master transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous pro-inflammatory genes [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/), [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/)]. This leads to a downstream reduction in the production of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212429224010447), [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/)]. In the context of diabetic wounds, this anti-inflammatory activity is particularly crucial, as it helps to resolve the prolonged inflammatory phase driven by macrophage-driven responses and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) via the AKT/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway [[13](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1632573/full)]. Concurrently, _C. asiatica_ activates the endogenous antioxidant defense system through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [[30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Activation of Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE), upregulating the expression of key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) [[30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full), [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92958-7)]. This dual action—suppressing pro-inflammatory signals while bolstering cellular antioxidant capacity—is a key driver of its efficacy in mitigating oxidative stress in conditions ranging from neurodegeneration to liver damage [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf), [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5083837/)].

In the realm of neuroprotection and cognitive enhancement, the pharmacology of _C. asiatica_ becomes even more intricate, targeting multiple facets of neuronal health and function [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122)]. A significant mechanism involves the modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission. Extracts and isolated triterpenoids have demonstrated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby potentiating cholinergic signaling—a classic therapeutic strategy for cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0254629925001383)]. Beyond this, the constituents exhibit direct neuroprotective effects against amyloid-beta (Aβ) toxicity, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf), [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92958-7)]. Asiaticoside, madecassoside, and asiatic acid have been shown to inhibit Aβ aggregation, reduce the formation of toxic oligomers, and protect hippocampal neurons from Aβ-induced cell death [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0254629925001383), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. They achieve this by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and preventing apoptosis [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full)]. Another critical neuroprotective mechanism is the suppression of neuroinflammation. The triterpenoids cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and can modulate microglial activation, the resident immune cells of the brain [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122)]. By inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream NF-κB signaling, they reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α within the central nervous system [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full)]. Finally, _C. asiatica_ promotes neuroplasticity by stimulating synaptogenesis and dendritic arborization [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6857646/)]. It enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular basis of learning and memory, and increases the expression of neurotrophic factors like Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which supports neuronal survival and growth [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)].

For the indication of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the pharmacological action is centered on strengthening the structural integrity of blood vessels and optimizing microcirculatory function [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf)]. _C. asiatica_ preparations are believed to stimulate the synthesis of connective tissue components within the walls of veins and capillaries, specifically chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronidase [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. This reinforcement of the vascular matrix helps to stabilize weakened veins, reduce their permeability, and improve venous tone [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. Clinically, this translates to a measurable decrease in capillary filtration rate and improved microcirculatory parameters, such as an increase in transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (tcPO2) and a decrease in transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (tcPCO2) [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)]. This fine-tuning of the microenvironment helps to alleviate symptoms associated with venous hypertension, such as edema, heaviness, and pain [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)]. While the precise molecular targets for this vascular effect are less defined than those for wound healing or neuroprotection, its consistency across numerous clinical trials suggests a robust and reproducible mechanism of action [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)].

## Preclinical Data Summary

Preclinical research provides a foundational understanding of the mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications of _Centella asiatica_, supporting many of the observations made in human clinical trials. Animal and in vitro studies have extensively characterized the herb's bioactive compounds and their effects on various pathological processes, highlighting its potential in dermatology, oncology, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472)]. The evidence consistently points towards a multi-target mode of action involving the modulation of inflammation, oxidative stress, collagen metabolism, and cell proliferation/apoptosis pathways.

In dermatology and wound healing, preclinical models robustly confirm the clinical findings. Topical application of _C. asiatica_ extracts or purified triterpenes accelerates wound closure in incision and burn models in rats and guinea pigs [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [33](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6882-12-103)]. Histopathological analysis reveals enhanced granulation tissue formation, increased collagen deposition, and accelerated epithelialization compared to controls [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [33](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6882-12-103)]. The aqueous extract applied topically (3 times daily for 24 days) increased cellular proliferation and collagen content in rat wound models, with gel formulations showing superior efficacy [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. Specifically, 0.2% topical asiaticoside in guinea pigs increased hydroxyproline levels by 56% and tensile strength by 57% [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica)]. In diabetic rats, a model of delayed healing, 0.4% topical asiaticoside similarly facilitated healing by boosting collagen content and epithelialization [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [24](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf8a/d159769cbcfbe720a691f931672e65db2511.pdf)]. The anti-inflammatory effects are also clearly demonstrated; methanol extract of _C. asiatica_ inhibits hypotonic-induced hemolysis in human erythrocytes, indicating anti-inflammatory activity [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx)]. Madecassoside has been shown to alleviate collagen-induced arthritis in mice by reducing inflammatory infiltration and joint destruction [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. Furthermore, asiaticoside has been identified as a weak tumor promoter in hairless mouse epidermis upon surface application, raising caution for dermal formulations [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)].

The anticancer potential of _C. asiatica_ is a significant area of preclinical investigation. The triterpenoids, particularly asiatic acid and madecassoside, have demonstrated cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects in various cancer cell lines [[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472), [74](https://www.wisdomlib.org/science/journal/world-journal-of-pharmaceutical-research/d/doc1376503.html)]. Asiatic acid acts as a potent inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key target in lung cancer management [[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472)]. Madecassoside induces apoptosis in cervical cancer cells and has shown efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx)]. Mechanistically, these compounds modulate key signaling pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation, such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)]. In vivo studies support these findings; oral administration of asiatic acid reduced tumor volume by 60% in glioblastoma xenografts and suppressed metastasis in breast cancer models [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)]. However, it is critical to note that no clinical trials have yet investigated _C. asiatica_ or its isolated compounds in cancer patients, representing a significant gap between preclinical promise and clinical validation [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)].

In neurobiology, preclinical models provide compelling evidence for the neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects attributed to _C. asiatica_. In rodent models of Alzheimer's disease, water extracts of _C. asiatica_ attenuated behavioral abnormalities, prevented intracellular Aβ aggregation, and protected hippocampal neurons from Aβ-induced toxicity [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. Asiaticoside was found to counteract rotenone-induced ROS increases and mitigate cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease models [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/)]. The herb's ability to promote neurite outgrowth and increase dendritic arborization is a key finding, suggesting a role in enhancing neural connectivity and plasticity [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6857646/)]. ECa 233, a standardized extract, was shown to enhance LTP in hippocampal slices, an effect comparable to that of the isolated glycosides, suggesting synergistic interactions among the constituents [[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. Furthermore, araliadiol, a polyacetylene compound from _C. asiatica_, protected hippocampal cells from oxidative and ER stress and improved memory in scopolamine-induced amnesia models [[32](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1347861321001080)]. These studies collectively support the rationale for investigating _C. asiatica_ in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders.

Beyond these primary areas, preclinical research has explored a wide range of other pharmacological activities. In cardiovascular models, _C. asiatica_ extract reduced myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function post-infarction [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx)]. In diabetic models, it lowered blood glucose levels and exhibited antidiabetic activity [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472)]. Hepatoprotective effects were observed in models of liver injury induced by dimethylnitrosamine and acetaminophen, likely mediated by its antioxidant properties [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472)]. The herb also shows antimicrobial activity against bacteria like _Streptozotocin_-induced diabetic rats and fungi [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472)]. In osteoporosis models, madecassoside inhibited osteoclast formation and activity, protecting against bone loss [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. These diverse findings underscore the broad therapeutic potential of _C. asiatica_, although the translation of these effects into clinically effective treatments requires rigorous human trials.

## Human Clinical Evidence Map

The human clinical evidence for _Centella asiatica_ is heterogeneous, with varying levels of robustness across different indications. The strongest and most consistent evidence supports its use in wound healing and scar management, followed by chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Evidence for cognitive enhancement and anxiety is promising but more mixed, often stemming from smaller trials. Conversely, for conditions like diabetic neuropathy and ulcerative colitis, clinical data is very limited, typically confined to pilot or single-arm studies. The table below maps the available evidence according to the specified hierarchy, grading claims based on the highest-quality study type available.

### Wound Healing and Scar Management

This is the area with the most robust human clinical evidence. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a systematic review confirm the efficacy of _C. asiatica_ in accelerating the healing of various types of wounds [[12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328954/)]. For diabetic foot ulcers, an RCT involving 170 patients showed that oral asiaticoside (300 mg/day) led to significantly greater wound contraction at days 7, 14, and 21 compared to placebo [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. Similarly, a study on 30 post-laser resurfacing patients found that a 0.05% topical ECa 233 gel significantly reduced erythema and improved wound appearance over 7 days [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [37](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/acm.2019.0325)]. The evidence for burns is equally compelling; a trial with 60 patients treated with 3% topical Centiderm ointment healed partial-thickness burns significantly faster than those treated with silver sulfadiazine (14.7 vs. 21.5 days) [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [17](https://www.nrfhh.com/pdf-203178-125923?filename=125923.pdf)]. For scar management, topical formulations demonstrate clear benefits. A large RCT (n=280) found that applying a cream containing _C. asiatica_ extract to surgical sites significantly reduced scar tenderness [[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0894113022001090)]. Another RCT on split-thickness skin graft donor sites confirmed significant improvements in pigmentation scores at 8 and 12 weeks [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/)]. A meta-analysis of 10 studies further solidified its role in acne vulgaris, showing a significant reduction in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts [[68](https://biomedres.us/pdfs/BJSTR.MS.ID.009114.pdf), [72](https://biomedres.us/fulltexts/BJSTR.MS.ID.009114.php)].

### Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)

The evidence for using _C. asiatica_ to treat CVI is strong, supported by numerous RCTs and a systematic review focusing on the use of standardized extracts like TECA (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) or TTFCA (Total Triterpenic Fraction of Centella Asiatica) [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)]. A systematic review pooling data from multiple trials concluded that oral administration of these extracts significantly improves microcirculatory parameters, including increasing tcPO2, decreasing tcPCO2, and improving venoarteriolar response [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)]. Doses ranging from 60 to 180 mg/day, administered for 2 to 8 weeks, were consistently effective [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)]. Several individual RCTs reported dose-dependent improvements in ankle swelling, leg heaviness, and pain [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. Long-term benefits have also been observed; one study in patients with diabetic microangiopathy found that 6 months of treatment with a triterpenic fraction (60 mg twice daily) significantly improved laser Doppler flowmetry readings and capillary permeability [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)].

### Cognitive Function and Neuroprotection

Evidence for cognitive enhancement in humans is more nuanced and heterogeneous. Some RCTs report positive results. A Thai study with 28 healthy elderly volunteers found that 750 mg/day of an aqueous extract for two months significantly enhanced working memory performance and mood [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. Another study in 60 elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) showed that 1000 mg/day (500 mg twice daily) for six months led to significant improvements in MMSE scores [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. An exploratory study in post-stroke patients also noted improved delayed recall memory with 750 mg/day [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. However, this positive evidence is contrasted by a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs, which found no statistically significant differences between _C. asiatica_ and placebo on any cognitive domain, although it did note a benefit in self-reported alertness [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. This discrepancy highlights the need for larger, higher-quality trials to clarify its true efficacy. No human studies have demonstrated benefits in patients with dementia [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)].

### Anxiety and Other Emerging Indications

The evidence for anxiety is preliminary. A double-blind RCT in 40 participants found that a single 12g oral dose of crude herb attenuated the acoustic startle response, a physiological measure of anxiety [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)]. However, other reviews classify the evidence for treating generalized anxiety disorder as low due to small patient numbers [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. For temporomandibular disorder (TMD), a recent pilot RCT found that 500 mg/day of the ECa 233 extract provided rapid, short-term analgesia at day 7, though the effect was not sustained at day 14 and another summary of the same trial concluded no significant benefit over placebo [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12008970/), [75](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06231212), [78](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/172ryd/?srsltid=AfmBOopZPb-0k9qwhPskCdhnKCkdAfb-nrZg1sNuwwBFWCNlTKj0qY3f)]. Clinical data for other conditions like diabetic neuropathy and ulcerative colitis is extremely limited, with only a few small, early-phase trials conducted [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [46](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgh3.70258)].

## Dosing & Administration

The appropriate dosing and administration of _Centella asiatica_ are highly dependent on the specific indication, the formulation used, and the desired therapeutic outcome. The literature describes a wide spectrum of preparations, from crude dried herb and teas to highly standardized ethanolic extracts and topical creams, each with distinct dosing guidelines [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. Standardization of active constituents, particularly triterpenoid saponins like asiaticoside and madecassoside, is a critical factor in ensuring product consistency and predictable clinical effects [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Clinicians must be aware of these variations when recommending products to patients.

For oral administration, doses vary significantly across indications. For the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the most studied indication for oral use, the typical dose of a standardized triterpenic extract ranges from 60 mg to 180 mg per day, often divided into two or three doses [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. This dosage range was used in multiple RCTs demonstrating efficacy in improving microcirculatory parameters and subjective symptoms [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. For cognitive enhancement, higher doses are often employed, reflecting the different pharmacological targets. Studies showing benefits in elderly volunteers or those with mild cognitive impairment have used doses of 500 mg to 1000 mg per day, typically administered in divided doses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. One study used an aqueous extract standardized to contain 1.09 mg/g asiaticoside and 48.89 mg/g asiatic acid at a dose of 750 mg/day for two months [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. A separate study in stroke patients used 750 mg/day or 1000 mg/day for six weeks [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. For topical applications, concentrations are generally lower. Authorized European formulations include creams containing 1% TECA (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) and powders with 2% TECA, applied 1 to 3 times daily depending on the preparation and condition [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)].

It is important to distinguish between different standardized extracts, as their compositions dictate their clinical use. TECA is a highly refined ethanolic extract containing approximately 40% asiaticoside and 60% a mixture of asiatic and madecassic acids [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. It is the standard for treating CVI and has been studied for its effects on the vascular endothelium [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. ECa 233 is another standardized extract, formulated into sprays or gels, containing a high percentage of triterpenoid glycosides (≥80%) with a specific madecassoside-to-asiaticoside ratio of approximately 1.5:1 [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. This formulation is more commonly used in neuroscience research and has been studied for its effects on cognition and wound healing [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12008970/), [45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. The term "total triterpenic fraction" (TTF) is often used interchangeably with TECA and refers to the same class of products [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)]. These extracts are considered pharma-grade and are preferred over crude preparations for achieving consistent therapeutic effects [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)]. For all oral preparations, it is recommended to follow a cycle of use, such as a maximum duration of 6 weeks followed by at least a 2-week break, to minimize potential risks associated with chronic use [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].

## Safety & Toxicology

_Centella asiatica_ is generally considered safe and well-tolerated at recommended doses, with most adverse events being mild and transient [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)]. However, a comprehensive safety profile reveals several important red flags and contraindications that clinicians must consider before recommending its use. These concerns range from rare but serious systemic toxicity to potential reproductive harm and local skin reactions. Vigilance and patient screening are paramount for ensuring safe clinical application.

The most significant safety concern associated with the oral administration of _C. asiatica_ is the potential for hepatotoxicity. Three case reports documented women developing granulomatous hepatitis after ingesting _C. asiatica_ tablets for weight loss over a period of 20 to 60 days [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf)]. Symptoms included jaundice, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, ALP), and bilirubin levels, which resolved upon discontinuation of the herb [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)]. Liver biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatous hepatitis [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. This rare but serious risk necessitates caution, especially with prolonged use beyond 6 weeks, and recommends periodic monitoring of liver function tests in patients undergoing long-term therapy [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [53](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/396846/)]. Cases of chronic hepatitis with cirrhotic transformation have also been reported [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)].

Reproductive toxicity is another critical area of concern, primarily based on animal studies. Reproductive toxicity studies in male rats have shown that oral administration of _C. asiatica_ leaf extract at doses of 10–100 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks caused dose-dependent reductions in sperm viability, motility, and spermatogenic cell counts [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Similar findings were reported in Sprague-Dawley rats given ethanol extract at 200–300 mg/kg/day for 42 days, which resulted in reduced serum testosterone, decreased sperm count, and testicular histopathological changes [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Based on this evidence, it is prudent to advise men wishing to conceive to avoid taking oral _C. asiatica_. This aligns with traditional warnings about its use during pregnancy. Infertility has been reported in rats exposed to the total saponoside fraction of the plant, and chronic use is contraindicated in pregnant women due to a possible risk of spontaneous abortion [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. Although not explicitly stated in all sources, its use during breastfeeding is also discouraged [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].

Common adverse events associated with oral use are generally mild and gastrointestinal in nature. Occasional complaints include nausea, stomach upset, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and sedation, particularly at high doses [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. In a Cochrane review of CVI trials, minor stomach pain was reported in some patients, and severe nausea leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in one instance [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)]. For topical use, the most frequent adverse event is allergic contact dermatitis, which can manifest as burning sensations, eczema, rash, or vesicular reactions [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834700/)]. While some patch testing studies have shown the extract itself to be non-sensitizing at low concentrations, cases of dermatitis have been reported, sometimes linked to excipients like propylene glycol, lavender oil, or geranium oil in commercial formulations [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Subcutaneous injections may cause allergic reactions or discoloration [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. Overdose can lead to headaches and transient unconsciousness [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].

There are also theoretical concerns regarding carcinogenicity and drug interactions. In a long-term animal study, topical application of pure asiaticoside (0.1% in benzene) to hairless mice was classified as a weak tumor promoter and was found to be very weakly carcinogenic to the dermis, producing sarcomas [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf)]. This finding raises a precautionary flag for the long-term, high-concentration topical use of pure asiaticoside, although the relevance to standard cosmetic or medical formulations is uncertain. Genotoxicity assays on _C. asiatica_ extracts have yielded negative results, suggesting it is not directly mutagenic [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Documented herb-drug interactions are absent, but theoretical risks exist. Its potential sedative effects warrant caution when co-administered with other CNS depressants [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. There is also a theoretical possibility of interference with blood glucose and cholesterol-lowering agents [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. One animal study suggested a potential interaction with the antiepileptic drug phenytoin, as a formulation containing _C. asiatica_ significantly reduced plasma phenytoin levels in rats [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica)]. Use should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to surgery due to its potential to affect bleeding time [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf)].

## Pharmacokinetics & Drug Interactions

The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of _Centella asiatica_ is complex, characterized by poor oral bioavailability and extensive first-pass metabolism, which poses challenges for systemic therapeutic application [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of its key bioactive triterpenoids are critical determinants of its efficacy and safety. Furthermore, while documented herb-drug interactions are scarce, theoretical possibilities exist based on its known pharmacological properties.

Following oral administration, the triterpenoid glycosides present in _C. asiatica_ extracts, namely asiaticoside and madecassoside, undergo rapid hydrolysis in the intestine by bacterial β-glycosidases [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/)]. This biotransformation converts the parent glycosides into their corresponding aglycones, asiatic acid and madecassic acid, respectively [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/)]. Consequently, plasma levels of the parent glycosides are typically negligible after oral dosing, as they are completely converted to aglycones [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/)]. The aglycones are then absorbed, primarily in the jejunum, and enter systemic circulation [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [47](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/18/8475)]. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans who received single oral doses of 30 mg and 60 mg of _C. asiatica_ extract showed that asiatic acid reached peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) at 4.2 to 4.5 hours [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf)]. Repeated dosing for seven days was found to increase the area under the curve (AUC) and half-life, indicating modified metabolism and accumulation [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)].

Despite this efficient conversion and absorption, the overall oral bioavailability of the triterpenoids is low, estimated to be less than 1-16% in some animal models [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/), [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)]. This limitation is attributed to their poor water solubility and extensive first-pass metabolism [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. For example, asiatic acid has a very short elimination half-life of just 0.348 hours in rats, indicating rapid clearance [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122)]. Madecassoside also exhibits a relatively short half-life, around 3.47 hours in rats [[60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8627341/)]. Excretion occurs primarily via feces through hepatobiliary routes, with minimal renal excretion of the parent compounds [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf)]. Despite this low systemic exposure, the compounds are widely distributed throughout the body, accumulating in tissues such as the brain, heart, liver, kidney, and skin within one hour of administration [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122)]. This widespread distribution, even with transient plasma concentrations, may be sufficient to exert localized therapeutic effects, particularly in the brain and skin.

The choice of formulation significantly impacts PK behavior. Standardized extracts like TECA, which contain a specific ratio of glycosides and aglycones, may have different absorption kinetics compared to whole-plant extracts [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)]. For instance, the AUC of madecassoside is 2-fold higher when administered as part of the ECa 233 extract compared to pure madecassoside, and the half-life of both madecassoside and asiaticoside is prolonged in the extract form, suggesting that the combination of compounds may alter metabolic pathways [[47](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/18/8475)]. To overcome the inherent limitations of poor solubility and bioavailability, advanced delivery systems are being developed. Nanoencapsulation, transfersomes, liposomes, and nanoemulsions have been shown to increase the bioavailability of active compounds by 50-60% and improve skin penetration for topical applications [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472), [51](https://pharmacia.pensoft.net/article/167217/)]. For example, transfersomal emulgels have demonstrated a 5.56-fold enhanced skin permeation of asiaticoside [[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472)], while solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) loaded with asiatic acid have shown enhanced delivery across the blood-brain barrier [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122)].

Regarding drug interactions, no clinically significant herb-drug interactions have been formally documented in the provided sources [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. However, based on its pharmacology, several theoretical interactions are plausible. Given its anti-inflammatory properties, concurrent use with NSAIDs or corticosteroids could potentially lead to additive effects [[53](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/396846/)]. Its potential sedative effects suggest a need for caution when combined with other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. There is also a theoretical risk of interference with medications for diabetes or hyperlipidemia, as preclinical studies have shown effects on blood glucose and lipid levels [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5083837/)]. One study in rats found that a formulation containing _C. asiatica_ significantly reduced plasma levels of the antiepileptic drug phenytoin, suggesting a potential for altered metabolism [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica)]. Furthermore, _C. asiatica_ extracts have been shown to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, which are responsible for metabolizing a vast number of prescription drugs [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)]. This inhibition could theoretically lead to increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates for these enzymes, although the clinical significance remains unproven.

The following table summarizes the available information on pharmacokinetics and drug interactions.

## Comparative Analysis (vs. Standard of Care)

A comparative analysis of _Centella asiatica_ versus established standard-of-care (SOC) therapies reveals a nuanced picture. For certain indications, particularly in dermatology, _C. asiatica_ demonstrates comparable or even superior efficacy to conventional treatments, often with a favorable safety profile. For other conditions, such as chronic venous insufficiency, it serves as a well-established alternative to compression stockings and venotonic drugs. However, for systemic conditions like cognitive decline and diabetic neuropathy, its role remains investigational, with no current evidence to support it as a replacement for SOC.

In the management of acute and chronic wounds, _C. asiatica_ has proven to be a potent agent. In a head-to-head comparison for second-degree burn wounds, a 3% topical Centiderm ointment (containing _C. asiatica_ extract) achieved complete healing significantly faster than the gold-standard silver sulfadiazine (SSD), a common topical antimicrobial agent [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [17](https://www.nrfhh.com/pdf-203178-125923?filename=125923.pdf)]. Patients treated with Centiderm had a mean healing time of 14.7 days versus 21.5 days for the SSD group, with no infections reported in the Centiderm group [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [17](https://www.nrfhh.com/pdf-203178-125923?filename=125923.pdf)]. This suggests that for superficial burns, a botanical preparation can be as effective as a synthetic antibiotic agent without the risk of microbial resistance. Similarly, for diabetic foot ulcers, oral asiaticoside (300 mg/day) significantly increased wound contraction rates compared to placebo, effectively shortening the healing time [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. While SOC for diabetic ulcers includes debridement, offloading, and infection control, _C. asiatica_ offers a targeted systemic intervention to address the underlying impairment in wound healing biology. For scar management, _C. asiatica_ cream has been shown to prevent scar tenderness after open carpal tunnel release surgery, a complication that can affect both aesthetics and function [[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0894113022001090)]. This represents a specific, evidence-based application for a preventative strategy in post-surgical care.

In the context of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), _C. asiatica_ (specifically TECA/TTFCA) is a well-established therapeutic option that functions as an alternative to mechanical compression and other venotonic drugs like diosmin or micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Multiple RCTs have demonstrated that oral TECA (60-180 mg/day) significantly improves objective microcirculatory parameters, such as transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2, and reduces subjective symptoms like leg heaviness and edema [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. These effects are comparable to those seen with other venotonic agents, making it a viable pharmaceutical-grade option for managing CVI. Its mechanism of action—strengthening vascular connective tissue—is complementary to the hemodynamic effects of compression therapy. Therefore, it can be positioned as either a standalone therapy or an adjunctive treatment.

The comparison becomes less clear for systemic conditions. For cognitive enhancement in aging populations, _C. asiatica_ is an herbal supplement, whereas SOC interventions for mild cognitive impairment are still evolving and may include cognitive training or medications for underlying conditions. The evidence for _C. asiatica_ is promising but not definitive enough to recommend it as a replacement for any SOC [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. The conflicting results from a meta-analysis versus individual RCTs highlight this uncertainty [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. For diabetic neuropathy, a Phase II trial evaluating a selected triterpenes formulation (CAST) showed a significant reduction in total symptom scores, but it also reported a high rate of transient adverse events [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. Compared to SOC treatments like gabapentin or pregabalin, which have robust evidence for pain relief, the evidence for _C. asiatica_ is preliminary. Moreover, the potential for hepatotoxicity with long-term use presents a significant safety consideration that is not typically associated with the SOC drugs [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)].

In summary, _C. asiatica_ holds a strong position as a comparator to SOC in dermatological applications, offering efficacy comparable to antibiotics and steroids with a better tolerability profile. For CVI, it is a validated pharmaceutical alternative to other venotonics. For other systemic indications, its role is currently supplementary or investigational, and it cannot be recommended as a substitute for established therapies pending further high-quality clinical evidence.

## Quality & Adulteration Checklist

Ensuring the quality, purity, and potency of _Centella asiatica_ products is critical for achieving consistent clinical outcomes and guaranteeing patient safety. The variability in phytochemical content, influenced by factors such as geographic origin, harvest time, and processing methods, necessitates rigorous quality control measures [[30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Regulatory frameworks and industry standards emphasize the importance of standardization to specific bioactive markers, primarily the triterpenoid saponins [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Clinicians and consumers should look for products that adhere to these standards and undergo third-party testing for contaminants.

The primary method for assessing the quality of _C. asiatica_ extracts is chromatographic fingerprinting, typically using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5083837/), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. These techniques allow for the identification and quantification of key marker compounds, enabling manufacturers to ensure batch-to-batch consistency [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. The European Pharmacopoeia sets a minimum requirement for dried aerial parts, mandating a content of not less than 6.0% total triterpenoid derivatives, expressed as asiaticoside [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834700/)]. For commercially available standardized extracts, the specifications are much more stringent. TECA (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) is a highly refined preparation that contains approximately 40% asiaticoside and a combined 60% of asiatic and madecassic acids [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. ECa 233 is another standardized extract that contains at least 80% total triterpenoid glycosides, with a specific madecassoside-to-asiaticoside ratio maintained at approximately 1.5 ± 0.5 [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12008970/), [45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. Products claiming to be standardized to these specifications should provide analytical certificates confirming compliance.

Adulteration and contamination are significant concerns in the herbal supplement market. While specific data on common adulterants for _C. asiatica_ is not detailed in the provided sources, general practices involve testing for heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial contaminants. Heavy metal testing is particularly important, as plants grown in contaminated soil can accumulate elements like arsenic and barium [[50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Arsenic levels of 0.91–2.17 mg/kg have been found in Indian-grown plants from contaminated fields, while barium levels in Malaysian plants ranged from 2.37–21.88 μg/g dry weight [[50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Sourcing from reputable suppliers who conduct regular testing for these contaminants is essential. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel concluded that various _C. asiatica_-derived ingredients are safe for use in cosmetics when formulated to be non-sensitizing, reinforcing the importance of proper manufacturing and quality control [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf)].

The following table outlines a checklist for evaluating the quality and authenticity of _Centella asiatica_ products.

Clinicians should advise patients to choose products from reputable manufacturers that provide third-party Certificates of Analysis (CoA) verifying the identity and concentration of the active markers. Look for certifications related to Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to ensure traceability and quality control [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Due to the high industrial demand and overexploitation of wild populations, the IUCN lists _C. asiatica_ as a threatened plant, underscoring the importance of sourcing from sustainable cultivation programs that adhere to conservation protocols [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)].

## Case Studies & Clinical Pearls

Integrating _Centella asiatica_ into clinical practice requires a nuanced understanding of its evidence base, formulation-specific effects, and safety profile. The following case scenarios and clinical pearls distill the key learnings from the available research to guide practitioners in making informed recommendations.

**Case Study 1: Post-Surgical Scar Management**
A 35-year-old female patient presents two weeks post-op for an abdominoplasty, expressing concern about hypertrophic scarring. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Based on the evidence, a clinical pearl would be to recommend a topical cream containing a standardized _C. asiatica_ extract. A Level I evidence study demonstrated that applying a petroleum-based cream with _C. asiatica_ extract to surgical sites significantly reduced scar tenderness in patients undergoing open carpal tunnel release [[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0894113022001090)]. Further, multiple studies confirm its efficacy in improving Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) scores, particularly for pigmentation and height, in various surgical contexts [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/), [24](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf8a/d159769cbcfbe720a691f931672e65db2511.pdf)]. The recommendation would be to use a cream containing 1% TECA or a formulation with a high concentration of asiaticoside and madecassoside (e.g., 5.12% asiaticoside and 5.1% madecassoside) [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/)]. The patient should be instructed to apply it twice daily once the wound is fully epithelialized and to continue for at least 12 weeks to see optimal results. This represents a safe, evidence-based, and cost-effective adjunct to standard post-operative care.

**Case Study 2: Chronic Venous Insufficiency with Diabetic Complications**
A 68-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes and moderate chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) complains of persistent leg heaviness, swelling, and occasional pain. He is already on metformin for his diabetes. The clinical pearl here is to consider adding a standardized oral _C. asiatica_ extract (TECA/TTFCA) to his regimen. Numerous RCTs have shown that doses of 60-180 mg/day of TECA/TTFCA significantly improve microcirculatory parameters and subjective symptoms in CVI patients [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. Crucially, one study demonstrated that oral TTFCA (60 mg twice daily) significantly improved laser Doppler flowmetry readings and reduced capillary permeability in patients with diabetic microangiopathy, a common complication of his condition [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)]. The recommendation would be for a TECA tablet (e.g., 60 mg) taken twice daily. It is important to counsel the patient that this is a supportive therapy to improve vascular health and comfort, not a cure for diabetes. Monitoring for potential interactions with his antidiabetic medication is prudent, though none are documented [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].

**Case Study 3: Cognitive Decline in an Elderly Patient**
A 72-year-old woman is concerned about her memory lapses and seeks natural remedies. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score is 27, indicating mild cognitive impairment. The evidence for _C. asiatica_ in this context is promising but not conclusive. One RCT showed that 1000 mg/day (500 mg twice daily) of an extract for six months led to significant improvement in MMSE scores in elderly subjects with MCI [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. Another trial in healthy elderly volunteers found a 750 mg/day dose improved working memory after two months [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. However, a broader meta-analysis found no significant benefit across all cognitive domains [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. The clinical pearl is to discuss _C. asiatica_ as a potential supplement, emphasizing the positive but mixed evidence. Recommend a standardized extract like ECa 233 or one specifically studied in cognitive trials. Advise starting with a lower dose (e.g., 500 mg/day) and monitor for any side effects. Most importantly, stress the absolute necessity of periodic liver function tests, given the rare but serious risk of hepatotoxicity with prolonged use [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)]. This approach balances hope with caution and prioritizes patient safety.

**Clinical Pearl: The Importance of Standardization**
A recurring theme across all indications is the superiority of standardized extracts over crude herb. For CVI, TECA is the validated preparation [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)]. For wound healing, topical formulations with a defined percentage of triterpenes are key [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/)]. For cognitive effects, extracts like ECa 233 are used in research [[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. Clinicians should always inquire about the standardization of a product before recommending it. A lack of standardization means the dose of active compounds is unknown, rendering clinical guidance impossible and risking inconsistent or ineffective outcomes.

**Clinical Pearl: Managing Expectations**
While _C. asiatica_ has a long history of traditional use, modern clinical evidence varies widely by indication. For dermatological applications, the evidence is robust. For CVI, it is strong. For cognitive health, it is promising but requires further validation. Clinicians should manage patient expectations accordingly. It is inappropriate to recommend it as a "miracle elixir" for all ailments. Instead, frame it as a scientifically-supported botanical for specific, evidence-backed uses, and be transparent about the limitations of the current data.

## Red Flags & Triage Parameters

While _Centella asiatica_ is generally safe, clinicians must be vigilant for specific red flags and contraindications that necessitate immediate cessation of use and appropriate triage. These warnings are derived from case reports of serious adverse events, animal toxicology studies, and traditional usage patterns. Proper patient screening and education are essential to mitigate these risks.

**Red Flag 1: Suspected Hepatotoxicity**
The most critical red flag is the potential for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Three case reports document women developing granulomatous hepatitis after ingesting _C. asiatica_ tablets for weight loss over 20-60 days [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [58](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centel062015FR.pdf)]. Presentation included jaundice, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, ALP), and bilirubin [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. All patients recovered after discontinuing the herb, and rechallenge in one case led to recurrence [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. This is a rare but serious risk.

- **Triage Parameters:** Any patient presenting with jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, or unexplained fatigue while taking _C. asiatica_ should be evaluated for liver injury. Obtain baseline and repeat liver function tests (LFTs: ALT, AST, ALP, Bilirubin) before initiating long-term therapy (>6 weeks) and periodically thereafter.
- **Action:** Immediately discontinue _C. asiatica_. Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for evaluation. Counsel the patient that this is a rare but potentially severe adverse event requiring prompt medical attention.

**Red Flag 2: Pregnancy and Fertility**
There is strong evidence from animal studies and traditional wisdom against the use of _C. asiatica_ in certain populations.

- **Triage Parameters:** Screen all female patients of childbearing potential for pregnancy status before prescribing. Ask men in couples trying to conceive about their plans.
- **Action:** Strictly contraindicate _C. asiatica_ in pregnant women due to the reported risk of infertility and potential for spontaneous abortion [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. Advise men wishing to conceive to avoid oral use due to findings of reduced sperm viability and testosterone in animal models [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)]. Breastfeeding is also contraindicated [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].

**Red Flag 3: Known Allergies and Skin Reactions**
Topical formulations can cause allergic contact dermatitis, which can range from mild irritation to severe eczematous reactions [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834700/)].

- **Triage Parameters:** Perform a thorough allergy history, particularly for sensitivities to plants in the Apiaceae family (e.g., celery, parsley, carrot).
- **Action:** Advise patients to perform a patch test on a small area of skin before widespread application. If a rash develops, discontinue the topical product. Consider that the reaction may be due to excipients rather than the active ingredient itself, as some case reports implicate propylene glycol or fragrances [[48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272), [50](https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/centella_web.pdf)].

**Red Flag 4: Concurrent Medications**
While formal interactions are not documented, theoretical risks exist, particularly concerning sedation and bleeding.

- **Triage Parameters:** Screen for concomitant use of CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, opioids, alcohol) and anticoagulants/antiplatelets.
- **Action:** Advise caution and close monitoring for excessive sedation if combining with other CNS depressants [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)]. Counsel patients to stop taking _C. asiatica_ at least two weeks prior to any scheduled surgery due to its potential to affect bleeding time [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf)].

**Red Flag 5: Underlying Health Conditions**
Certain pre-existing conditions warrant special consideration.

- **Triage Parameters:** Screen for liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis), as _C. asiatica_ should be avoided in individuals with liver disease due to the risk of worsening hepatic damage [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf)].
- **Action:** Do not prescribe _C. asiatica_ to patients with diagnosed liver disease. Exercise extreme caution and require frequent LFT monitoring in patients with a history of liver issues.

By systematically addressing these red flags during patient consultation, clinicians can safely incorporate _C. asiatica_ into their therapeutic arsenal while minimizing the risk of adverse events.

## Research Frontiers (Next 5 Years)

The future of _Centella asiatica_ research is poised to move beyond the foundational questions of efficacy and safety toward more sophisticated investigations into its mechanisms, optimization of delivery, and validation in specific, understudied clinical populations. The next five years are likely to focus on resolving existing controversies, harnessing nanotechnology for enhanced bioavailability, and conducting large-scale, long-term trials to establish definitive clinical roles.

One of the most pressing frontiers is clarifying the conflicting evidence for cognitive enhancement. While numerous preclinical studies are exceptionally promising, translating these findings into consistent clinical benefits has been challenging [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)]. Future research will likely involve larger, multicenter RCTs with longer follow-up periods in well-defined patient populations, such as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-stage Alzheimer's disease [[73](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05591027?term=Centella%20asiatica&viewType=Table&rank=6)]. A key goal will be to identify biomarkers of response, perhaps related to the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway or BDNF levels, to predict which patients are most likely to benefit [[30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full), [45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. Investigating different standardized extracts, such as ECa 233, in dedicated cognitive trials will also be crucial to determine if certain formulations are superior for neurological indications [[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)].

Another major frontier lies in overcoming the poor bioavailability of _C. asiatica_'s triterpenoids. The development and clinical validation of advanced delivery systems represent a significant opportunity to unlock the full therapeutic potential of the herb. Nanotechnology-based approaches like liposomes, transfersomes, microneedle patches, and solid lipid nanoparticles are already being explored to enhance skin penetration for topical applications and improve systemic absorption for oral use [[18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142524000472), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122), [51](https://pharmacia.pensoft.net/article/167217/)]. Future studies will focus on optimizing these formulations to achieve targeted delivery to specific tissues, such as the brain for neuroprotection or the skin for wound healing, thereby increasing efficacy and reducing the required dosage [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/)]. Intranasal delivery systems, which bypass the first-pass metabolism, are particularly promising for delivering compounds like asiatic acid directly to the brain for treating neurodegenerative diseases [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [28](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07853890.2025.2559122)].

Expanding the clinical evidence base for understudied indications is another key area of focus. For oncology, the gap between compelling preclinical data and the absence of human trials is substantial [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)]. Early-phase clinical trials investigating _C. asiatica_ or its isolated compounds as adjuvants to chemotherapy in specific cancers, such as breast or glioblastoma, are needed to assess safety and potential synergistic effects [[70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011005/)]. In metabolic disorders, the role of _C. asiatica_ in managing diabetic complications, such as xerotic skin, is beginning to be explored [[81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7471832/), [82](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03815305)]. Future research could expand on these findings to investigate its potential in preventing or treating diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, leveraging its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx)]. Additionally, ongoing trials are evaluating its effects on vascular endothelial function in older adults, which could provide valuable insights into its role in cardiovascular prevention [[71](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06472791)].

Finally, the field will benefit from a deeper understanding of the chemotypic variation in _C. asiatica_ and the concept of synergy between its constituents. Different plant chemotypes have varying ratios of asiaticoside and madecassoside, which may influence their therapeutic profile [[30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.687935/full), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12298232/)]. Research comparing the effects of standardized extracts with different constituent profiles will help elucidate structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, proteomic and metabolomic studies are beginning to unravel how the full extract interacts differently with cellular pathways compared to isolated compounds, highlighting the importance of the "herbal matrix" effect [[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-12622-2)]. This knowledge will inform the development of next-generation standardized extracts designed for maximal efficacy.

## Protocol Cards (Condition-Specific)

This section provides concise, actionable protocol cards for clinicians based on the available evidence for key indications. Each card outlines the condition, the rationale for use, the recommended protocol, and key considerations.

#### **Protocol Card: Wound Healing (Acute and Chronic)**

- **Indication:** Accelerated healing of acute wounds (incisions, abrasions), chronic wounds (diabetic ulcers), and burns.
- **Rationale:** _C. asiatica_ stimulates fibroblast proliferation, enhances collagen synthesis, and promotes angiogenesis, addressing the core biological processes of wound repair [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328954/), [15](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Systematic-Review-of-the-Effect-of-Centella-on-Arribas-L%C3%B3pez-Zand/cf686e3a08e90c5778fd28187ef232b09debbc3e)]. Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties create a favorable environment for healing [[4](https://journals.lww.com/wtcm/fulltext/2023/09040/phytochemistry,_pharmacology,_and_clinical.1.aspx), [39](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212429224010447)].
- **Recommended Protocol:**
  - **Topical Application:** Apply a cream or ointment containing a standardized extract (e.g., 1% TECA or equivalent) or a high concentration of asiaticoside/madecassoside (e.g., 5.12% asiaticoside) to the affected area 1-3 times daily [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/)]. Ensure the wound bed is clean and free of debris before application.
  - **Oral Supplementation (for chronic wounds):** For conditions like diabetic foot ulcers, consider oral supplementation with an extract standardized to triterpenoids. A dose of 300 mg of asiaticoside per day has been shown to accelerate healing [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)].
- **Key Considerations:**
  - Monitor for signs of allergic contact dermatitis, especially with topical use [[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/centella-asiatica), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834700/)].
  - For chronic wounds, combine with standard medical care, including glycemic control, debridement, and offloading.
  - Evidence is strongest for topical application; oral use is supported primarily for diabetic wounds.

#### **Protocol Card: Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)**

- **Indication:** Management of symptoms associated with CVI, including leg heaviness, pain, edema, and varicose veins.
- **Rationale:** Standardized oral extracts of _C. asiatica_ (TECA/TTFCA) strengthen the structural integrity of blood vessel walls by stimulating connective tissue synthesis, which helps to reduce capillary permeability and improve microcirculatory efficiency [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/)].
- **Recommended Protocol:**
  - Administer a standardized oral extract of _C. asiatica_ (TECA or TTFCA) at a dose of 60-180 mg per day, divided into two or three doses [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)].
- **Key Considerations:**
  - This is a well-supported pharmaceutical-grade option that can be used as monotherapy or in conjunction with compression stockings.
  - Effects are cumulative; a minimum treatment duration of 2-8 weeks is typically required to observe improvements in symptoms and objective measures [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)].
  - Standardized extracts are superior to crude preparations for achieving predictable results.

#### **Protocol Card: Cognitive Enhancement & Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**

- **Indication:** Support for age-related cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
- **Rationale:** _C. asiatica_ constituents exhibit neuroprotective effects, including acetylcholinesterase inhibition, attenuation of amyloid-beta toxicity, and promotion of neuroplasticity and synaptogenesis, which are thought to underlie its cognitive-enhancing effects [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427517/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)].
- **Recommended Protocol:**
  - Administer a standardized oral extract (e.g., ECa 233 or similar) at a dose of 500-1000 mg per day, divided into two doses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)].
- **Key Considerations:**
  - Evidence is promising but mixed; set realistic expectations with patients [[29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)].
  - **CRITICAL:** Mandate baseline and periodic monitoring of liver function tests (ALT, AST) due to rare reports of hepatotoxicity with prolonged use [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)].
  - Limit continuous use to 6 weeks, followed by a break of at least 2 weeks [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].

#### **Protocol Card: Scar Management**

- **Indication:** Prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids; improvement of post-surgical scar appearance.
- **Rationale:** _C. asiatica_ modulates the inflammatory phase of scar formation, promotes the maturation of the extracellular matrix, and stimulates type I collagen production, leading to softer, less visible scars [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3834700/)].
- **Recommended Protocol:**
  - Apply a cream containing a standardized _C. asiatica_ extract (e.g., 1% TECA or 5.12% asiaticoside) to the scar site twice daily [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/)].
  - Begin application as soon as the wound is fully epithelialized and continue for a minimum of 3 months for optimal results [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/)].
- **Key Considerations:**
  - This is a safe and effective preventative strategy for high-risk surgical sites, such as open carpal tunnel release [[22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0894113022001090)].
  - For mature scars, continued application may improve pliability and pigmentation [[24](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf8a/d159769cbcfbe720a691f931672e65db2511.pdf)].

## Clinical Decision Rules (IF/THEN/BECAUSE)

These decision rules are designed to translate the evidence into practical clinical guidance, helping clinicians select the appropriate indication, formulation, and dosing for a patient based on their specific clinical presentation.

**Decision Rule 1: IF** a patient presents with acute wounds (e.g., surgical incisions, minor burns) OR chronic wounds (e.g., diabetic ulcers) AND BECAUSE the goal is to accelerate healing, THEN recommend TOPICAL APPLICATION of a standardized _Centella asiatica_ cream or ointment (e.g., 1% TECA) 1-3 times daily. BECAUSE topical formulations have strong evidence for stimulating collagen synthesis and angiogenesis locally [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [17](https://www.nrfhh.com/pdf-203178-125923?filename=125923.pdf)]. IF the patient has a chronic condition like diabetes contributing to impaired healing, THEN add ORAL SUPPLEMENTATION with an extract standardized to triterpenoids (e.g., 300 mg asiaticoside/day) to address systemic factors [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8956065/), [29](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/uploads/cognitive_vitality_media/Centella-asiatica-Cognitive-Vitality-For-Researchers.pdf)].

**Decision Rule 2: IF** a patient is diagnosed with Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) AND BECAUSE the aim is to improve symptoms like leg heaviness and edema, THEN prescribe ORAL ADMINISTRATION of a standardized TECA/TTFCA extract at 60-180 mg/day. BECAUSE this formulation has been consistently shown in RCTs to strengthen vascular walls and improve microcirculatory parameters [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3594936/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. IF the patient is also diabetic, THEN this recommendation is particularly relevant as TECA has shown efficacy in diabetic microangiopathy [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)].

**Decision Rule 3: IF** a patient expresses concerns about age-related cognitive decline OR has a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) AND BECAUSE the goal is to support cognitive function, THEN recommend ORAL ADMINISTRATION of a standardized extract (e.g., ECa 233) at 500-1000 mg/day. BECAUSE clinical trials have demonstrated improvements in cognitive scores and memory with these doses, attributed to neuroprotective and neuroplasticity-promoting mechanisms [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3359802/), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/), [52](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9f8/09247b59ea4d99cc9a4e193b9b5ed68e66b0.pdf)]. IF the patient is willing to accept the risk, THEN initiate the protocol ONLY AFTER obtaining baseline liver function tests and agreeing to periodic monitoring due to the rare but serious risk of hepatotoxicity [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full), [48](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10915818231158272)].

**Decision Rule 4: IF** a patient is undergoing elective surgery with a high risk of hypertrophic scarring AND BECAUSE the objective is to prevent or minimize scar formation, THEN recommend PREVENTATIVE TOPICAL APPLICATION of a _C. asiatica_ cream starting immediately after wound closure. BECAUSE studies show it is effective in modulating the inflammatory phase of wound healing and improving scar maturity [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166374/), [22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0894113022001090)]. IF the patient has a history of keloids, THEN counseling on the potential for benefit is warranted, but success is not guaranteed [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf)].

**Decision Rule 5: IF** a patient is seeking a natural remedy for anxiety OR suffers from acute Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) pain AND BECAUSE the goal is to reduce anxiety or pain, THEN cautiously consider ORAL ADMINISTRATION of a standardized extract. BECAUSE preclinical data supports anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory effects, and a pilot RCT showed rapid pain reduction in TMD [[5](https://wjarr.com/sites/default/files/WJARR-2022-0726.pdf), [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12008970/), [75](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06231212)]. IF considering for anxiety, THEN acknowledge that the evidence is preliminary and more robust trials are needed [[2](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-report/superseded-assessment-report-centella-asiatica-l-urban-herba_en.pdf), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.568032/full)]. IF considering for TMD, THEN explain that the effect may be short-lived and not sustained beyond 7-14 days [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12008970/), [78](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/172ryd/?srsltid=AfmBOopZPb-0k9qwhPskCdhnKCkdAfb-nrZg1sNuwwBFWCNlTKj0qY3f)]. IN ALL CASES, CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIVE SEDATIVE EFFECTS WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116297/)].
