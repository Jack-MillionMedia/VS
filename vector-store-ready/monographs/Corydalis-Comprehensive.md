## Quick Reference: Clinician TL;DR

### Evidence Grade Summary

**Pain Relief (Various Types): Evidence Grade C**
- Key finding: Preclinical studies show analgesic effects for inflammatory and neuropathic pain without tolerance development
- Clinical bottom line: Promising traditional analgesic, requires more human clinical validation

**Neuropathic Pain: Evidence Grade C**
- Key finding: Preclinical evidence for neuropathic pain relief via spinal central sensitization modulation
- Clinical bottom line: Promising mechanism, limited human clinical data

### Clinical Bottom Line

**When to Use:**
- Various pain conditions (traditional use, Grade C evidence)
- Neuropathic pain (preclinical evidence, Grade C)
- Adjunctive pain management

**When NOT to Use:**
- Severe pain requiring immediate medical intervention
- Pregnancy (insufficient safety data)
- Known allergy to Papaveraceae family

### Safety Snapshot

- **Overall Safety Rating:** Good (with precautions)
- **Most Common AE:** Mild GI upset (rare)
- **Critical Safety Concerns:** Pregnancy (insufficient data), potential CNS effects
- **Drug Interactions:** Unknown (insufficient data)

### Standard Dosing

**Pain Relief:** 3-9g dried tuber decoction daily (traditional use); standardized extracts dosing not established

### Key Clinical Pearl

Corydalis demonstrates unique advantage: analgesic effects without tolerance development (unlike opioids). Preclinical studies suggest effectiveness for neuropathic pain, which is often difficult to treat. However, human clinical trials are limited - use with caution and monitor closely.

## 2.0 Phytochemistry & Active Constituents

### 2.1 Primary Active Constituents

**Alkaloids (Primary Active Compounds):**
- Tetrahydropalmatine (THP)
- Corydaline
- Dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB)
- L-tetrahydropalmatine
- **Pharmacological Activity:** Analgesic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective

**Other Constituents:**
- Protoberberine alkaloids
- **Pharmacological Activity:** Multiple pain pathways

### 2.2 Standardization Markers

**Primary Marker:** Total alkaloids (tetrahydropalmatine content) - target range not established  
**Analytical Methods:** HPLC for alkaloid quantification

---

## 3.0 Pharmacology & Mechanisms of Action

### 3.1 Primary Mechanism: Dopamine Receptor Modulation

**Molecular Target:** D2 dopamine receptors

**Mechanistic Evidence:**
- *In vitro* studies: D2 receptor antagonism
- Animal studies: Analgesic effects via dopamine pathways
- **Clinical Relevance:** Non-opioid analgesic mechanism

### 3.2 Primary Mechanism: Spinal Central Sensitization Modulation

**Molecular Target:** Spinal cord pain pathways

**Mechanistic Evidence:**
- Animal studies: Reduces central sensitization in neuropathic pain models
- **Clinical Relevance:** Effective for neuropathic pain (often opioid-resistant)

### 3.3 Primary Mechanism: Anti-Inflammatory

**Molecular Target:** Inflammatory mediators

**Mechanistic Evidence:**
- *In vitro* studies: Reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Animal studies: Anti-inflammatory effects
- **Clinical Relevance:** Supports use for inflammatory pain

### 3.4 Unique Advantage: No Tolerance Development

**Key Finding:** Unlike opioids, Corydalis does not cause tolerance in preclinical studies  
**Clinical Relevance:** Potential long-term use without dose escalation

---

## 4.0 Clinical Evidence by Indication

### 4.1 Pain Relief - Various Types (Evidence Grade: C)

**Evidence Quality:** Grade C - Preclinical evidence strong, limited human clinical trials

#### Evidence Summary

**Preclinical Evidence:**
- Strong analgesic effects in animal models
- Effective for inflammatory and neuropathic pain
- No tolerance development
- Neuroprotective properties

**Human Clinical Data:**
- Limited clinical trials
- Traditional use extensive (TCM)
- Case reports positive

**Clinical Significance:**
- Promising analgesic with unique advantages
- Requires more rigorous human clinical validation

#### Clinical Application

**Patient Selection:**
- Ideal candidates: Various pain conditions, neuropathic pain (preclinical evidence)
- Poor candidates: Severe pain requiring immediate intervention

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Onset of effect: Unknown (insufficient human data)
- Magnitude of benefit: Moderate (based on preclinical data)
- Response rate: Unknown

**Bottom Line:** Promising traditional analgesic with unique advantages (no tolerance); use with caution pending more human clinical data

### 4.2 Neuropathic Pain (Evidence Grade: C)

**Evidence Quality:** Grade C - Preclinical evidence, limited human data

**Why Limited:**
- Strong preclinical evidence for neuropathic pain
- Mechanism well-understood (spinal central sensitization)
- Limited human clinical trials

**Recommendation:** Consider as adjunctive support with close monitoring
