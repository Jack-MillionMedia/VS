## Clinician Summary (TL;DR)

St. John's Wort (SJW) is a first-line herbal option for mild to moderate depression with evidence-based efficacy comparable to standard antidepressants. The herb contains multiple bioactive compounds, with hyperforin being the primary antidepressant agent through broad-spectrum monoamine reuptake inhibition. While generally well-tolerated with fewer side effects than SSRIs, SJW carries significant drug interaction risks due to CYP450 enzyme induction. Clinicians must carefully screen for contraindicated medications before recommending this herb.

### Main Indication

St. John's Wort is indicated for **mild to moderate depression** with Grade A evidence. According to PubMed, meta-analyses show SJW extracts produce clinical response rates comparable to standard antidepressants and superior to placebo ([DOI: 10.1192/bjp.186.2.99](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.186.2.99)) ([Source: Advances in Medical Sciences](https://advances.umw.edu.pl/en/article/2023/32/2/151/)). It is **not recommended for severe major depression** due to inconsistent efficacy in that population ([DOI: 10.1192/bjp.186.2.99](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.186.2.99)).

### Mechanism of Action

Antidepressant effects are primarily linked to **hyperforin**, which broadly inhibits reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate by increasing intracellular Na⁺/Ca²⁺ via TRPC6 channel activation ([ResearchGate source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224972930_Medical_Attributes_of_St_John's_Wort_Hypericum_perforatum)). Hypericin, a polycyclic naphthodianthrone, has weak MAO-A/MAO-B inhibition in vitro and modulates neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., sigma-1, GABA_A, adenosine), but is less central to antidepressant activity. Hypericin's photodynamic properties underlie SJW's antiviral and anticancer research interest, though these are not established clinical uses.

### Safety Profile

Overall well-tolerated with side effects typically mild and fewer than SSRIs ([Source: Advances in Medical Sciences](https://advances.umw.edu.pl/en/article/2023/32/2/151/)). Common reactions include gastrointestinal upset, headache, fatigue, dry mouth, or dizziness. **Photosensitivity** can occur, especially at high doses due to hypericin—advise sun protection for fair-skinned patients on large doses. Rarely, SJW has triggered **mania or psychosis** in susceptible individuals ([Source: Advances in Medical Sciences](https://advances.umw.edu.pl/en/article/2023/32/2/151/)). **Serotonin syndrome** is possible if combined with other serotonergic drugs; avoid concurrent use with antidepressants.

### Drug Interaction Risk (Critical Safety Concern)

**Extensive drug interaction risk—this is SJW's most critical safety concern.** SJW (high-hyperforin extracts) potently induces CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and P-glycoprotein via PXR activation ([DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00054](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00054)). This **reduces levels and efficacy** of many drugs including:

- Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus
- Anticoagulants: warfarin
- Cardiovascular: digoxin
- Contraceptives: oral contraceptives
- Antiretrovirals: HIV protease inhibitors (indinavir)
- Anticonvulsants
- Chemotherapeutics

Clinically, SJW has caused transplant rejection (cyclosporine failure), unplanned pregnancies (OC failure), and breakthrough seizures. **Always review medications** for compatibility; SJW is contraindicated with many critical therapies. Using **low-hyperforin extracts (≤1 mg hyperforin/day)** can markedly mitigate interaction risk ([DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00054](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00054)).

### Standard Dosing

Standardized **dry extracts (0.3% hypericin, 2-5% hyperforin)** are used in most trials. Typical adult dose for depression is **900 mg/day** (300 mg TID) of a 3-7:1 extract, titratable to 1,200-1,800 mg/day for non-responders ([DOI: 10.1192/bjp.186.2.99](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.186.2.99)). Clinical effect on mood develops over 2-6 weeks. For other indications (PMS, somatic symptoms), effective dosing falls in the 600-1,000 mg/day range of similar extracts. **Do not combine with conventional antidepressants.** If switching from SJW to an SSRI or vice versa, allow a 1-2 week washout period.

### Clinical Pearls

SJW is a legitimate alternative for mild-to-moderate depressive disorder, especially in patients favoring "natural" therapies or those with SSRI intolerance—provided they are **NOT on contraindicated medications** and are counseled on interaction risks. It may also benefit **somatic symptom disorder** (Grade A, improves somatic complaints) ([DOI: 10.1097/01.psy.0000128900.13711.5b](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.psy.0000128900.13711.5b)), and has modest efficacy in **PMS** (reduces physical and behavioral symptoms; Grade B) ([DOI: 10.2165/11530120-000000000-00000](https://doi.org/10.2165/11530120-000000000-00000)) and **menopausal mood symptoms** (improves menopausal quality-of-life and sleep; Grade B) ([DOI: 10.1097/gme.0b013e31818572a0](https://doi.org/10.1097/gme.0b013e31818572a0)). It is **not effective for OCD or ADHD** (Grade D) ([DOI: 10.1097/00004850-200511000-00003](https://doi.org/10.1097/00004850-200511000-00003)) ([Source: Advances in Medical Sciences](https://advances.umw.edu.pl/en/article/2023/32/2/151/)).

## Botanical Identity

**Botanical Name:** Hypericum perforatum L.

**Family:** Hypericaceae (formerly Clusiaceae or Guttiferae)

**Common Names:** St. John's Wort, Common St. John's Wort, Perforate St. John's Wort, Klamath weed, Goatweed

**Part Used:** Flowering tops (aerial parts collected during flowering period)

**Etymology and Cultural Background:**
- The word "wort" comes from Old English, meaning "plant" or "herb"
- The plant's modern name, St. John's Wort, is derived from its flowering around June 24th, the feast day of St. John the Baptist (the summer solstice)
- Historically, before this Christian association, the herb was known simply as Hypericum—from the Greek words *hyper* ("over") and *eikon* ("image"), as people once hung the plant over religious icons to ward off evil spirits
- During the Dark Ages, it was used to purify spaces and "drive out the devil" from those thought to be possessed—a reflection of how early societies linked mental illness to spiritual affliction. What was once called "possession" might today be understood as clinical depression, a condition for which St. John's Wort remains relevant

**Traditional Use:** Historically used in European traditional medicine for centuries to treat wounds, nerve pain, and melancholy. The name "St. John's Wort" derives from the plant's tendency to bloom around St. John's Day (June 24th). The species name "perforatum" refers to the translucent dots on the leaves that appear as perforations when held up to light.

### Historical Summary

From ancient spiritual and healing rituals to its modern role in psychiatry, St. John's Wort bridges folk tradition and clinical research. Its long-standing use for emotional balance and wound care reflects its enduring relevance as a symbol of light, purification, and healing.

## Phytochemistry

St. John's Wort contains multiple classes of bioactive compounds that contribute to its pharmacological effects. The complex chemical composition includes naphthodianthrones, phloroglucinols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, with significant variation depending on plant part, harvest time, and extraction methods.

### Major Compound Classes

**Naphthodianthrones (0.1-0.3% dry weight):** Hypericin and pseudohypericin are the primary compounds in this class. Hypericin is a photosensitizing naphthodianthrone with antiviral and monoamine-oxidase-inhibiting activity. These red pigments are photoactive and contribute to both therapeutic effects and photosensitivity risk. Hypericin content is used as a standardization marker in many preparations.

**Phloroglucinols (2-5% dry weight):** Hyperforin and adhyperforin represent the most important compounds for antidepressant activity. Hyperforin modulates serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and glutamate reuptake and is the major antidepressant constituent. It is highly lipophilic and unstable, requiring special extraction and storage conditions. It serves as a key standardization marker in modern preparations. Hyperforin content can vary dramatically between preparations, affecting both efficacy and interaction potential.

**Flavonoids (2-4% dry weight):** Multiple flavonoids are present including hyperoside, rutin, quercetin, quercitrin, isoquercitin, and kaempferol. These compounds contribute to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasoprotective effects. Key flavonoids include:
- **Quercetin:** Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
- **Rutin:** Antioxidant and vasoprotective effects
- **Kaempferol:** Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity

**Phenolic Acids:** Chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and related compounds contribute to antioxidant properties.

**Essential Oils (0.1-0.3%):** Various terpenes including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes contribute to the overall phytochemical profile.

**Tannins (3-16%):** Condensed tannins and procyanidins contribute to astringent properties.

### Standardization Markers

Commercial extracts are typically standardized to:
- Hypericin: 0.3% (range 0.1-0.3%)
- Hyperforin: 2-5% (low-hyperforin extracts contain <1%)

The ratio of these compounds significantly affects clinical efficacy and safety profile, particularly regarding drug interaction potential.

## Mechanisms of Action

St. John's Wort exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple molecular mechanisms involving neurotransmitter systems, receptor modulation, and intracellular signaling pathways. The antidepressant activity results from the combined effects of several constituents, with hyperforin playing the primary role.

### Neurotransmitter Reuptake Inhibition (Primary Mechanism)

Hyperforin inhibits the reuptake of multiple neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate. Unlike conventional antidepressants that directly interact with specific transporter proteins, hyperforin acts through a novel mechanism: it activates TRPC6 (transient receptor potential canonical 6) channels, leading to increased intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. This ionic change disrupts the sodium gradient required for monoamine transporter function, resulting in broad-spectrum reuptake inhibition.

This multi-target reuptake inhibition distinguishes hyperforin from selective reuptake inhibitors and may contribute to its efficacy across multiple mood-related conditions. The mechanism requires continuous presence of hyperforin, consistent with the 2-6 week onset of clinical effects seen in trials.

### MAO Inhibition (Minor Contribution)

Early research suggested hypericin strongly inhibited monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes, but subsequent studies demonstrated only weak MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations. While hypericin may contribute to overall therapeutic effects, MAO inhibition does not appear to be a primary mechanism of antidepressant action. This finding is clinically significant as it explains why SJW does not cause tyramine-related hypertensive crises typical of pharmaceutical MAO inhibitors.

### Receptor Modulation

Multiple constituents interact with various neurotransmitter receptors:

- Sigma receptors: Hyperforin and hypericin show affinity for sigma-1 receptors, which modulate neurotransmitter systems and have neuroprotective effects
- GABA_A receptors: Components enhance GABAergic neurotransmission, contributing to anxiolytic effects
- Adenosine receptors: Modulation may contribute to neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects
- NMDA receptors: Some evidence suggests glutamatergic modulation

### Anti-inflammatory and Neuroprotective Effects

**Mechanism:** Flavonoids and phenolic acids contribute to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may support immune and liver function. Cellular mechanisms include:
- Antioxidant flavonoids reduce lipid peroxidation
- Reduction of inflammatory cytokines
- NF-κB inhibition
- Cytokine modulation

**Clinical Significance:** These mechanisms may contribute to neuroprotection and could explain efficacy in conditions with inflammatory components. The anti-inflammatory effects also support traditional use for wound healing and skin conditions.

### Gene Expression and Enzyme Induction

Hyperforin activates the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. This mechanism underlies SJW's extensive drug interaction profile through induction of:

- Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19)
- P-glycoprotein transporter
- Other drug transporters

Low-hyperforin preparations (<1 mg/day) minimize this effect while potentially maintaining antidepressant efficacy through other mechanisms.

### Photodynamic Properties

Hypericin demonstrates photosensitizing properties, absorbing light energy and generating reactive oxygen species. While this mechanism underlies cutaneous photosensitivity risk, it has also generated interest in potential antiviral and anticancer applications, though these remain experimental.

### Summary of Mechanisms of Action

**CATEGORY:** Integrated Mechanism Overview

St. John's Wort's therapeutic effects are attributed to multiple interconnected mechanisms:

**Neurochemical Mechanisms:**
- Inhibits reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA
- Modulates glutamate neurotransmission
- Similar outcomes to SSRIs but via multiple pathways

**Enzymatic Mechanisms:**
- Down-regulates monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B)
- Up-regulates 5-HT receptors
- Induces CYP450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19) and P-glycoprotein

**Cellular Mechanisms:**
- Antioxidant flavonoids reduce lipid peroxidation
- Reduces inflammatory cytokines
- Modulates immune and liver function

**Topical Mechanisms:**
- Promotes epithelial repair via astringent and antimicrobial activity
- Anti-inflammatory effects support wound healing

**Clinical Significance:** The multi-pathway approach distinguishes SJW from selective reuptake inhibitors and may contribute to its efficacy across multiple mood-related conditions. However, the enzyme induction mechanism underlies significant drug interaction risks.

## Pharmacokinetics

Understanding St. John's Wort's pharmacokinetic profile is essential for optimizing dosing, predicting interactions, and ensuring safe clinical use. The pharmacokinetics vary significantly among constituents and are influenced by extract composition and formulation.

### Absorption

Hypericin demonstrates poor and variable oral bioavailability (approximately 10-15%), with peak plasma concentrations occurring 3-6 hours after oral administration. Food intake, particularly fatty meals, may enhance hypericin absorption. Hyperforin shows better lipophilic absorption but is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. Individual variation in absorption is substantial, contributing to variable clinical responses.

### Distribution

Both hypericin and hyperforin are highly protein-bound (>95%) and lipophilic, facilitating distribution into tissues including the brain. The volume of distribution is large, indicating extensive tissue penetration. Both compounds cross the blood-brain barrier, with brain concentrations adequate for pharmacological effects. The high lipophilicity also leads to accumulation in adipose tissue.

### Metabolism

Hyperforin undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily through oxidation and conjugation reactions. While CYP450 enzymes metabolize hyperforin, the compound paradoxically induces these same enzymes, complicating pharmacokinetic predictions. Hypericin metabolism is less well characterized but involves oxidative pathways. The parent compounds and multiple metabolites all contribute to biological activity.

### Elimination

Elimination half-lives vary by constituent:
- Hypericin: approximately 24-48 hours
- Pseudohypericin: similar to hypericin
- Hyperforin: approximately 9 hours (shorter due to extensive metabolism)

Excretion occurs through both renal and fecal routes, with biliary excretion significant for lipophilic compounds. The relatively long half-life of hypericin supports once or twice-daily dosing regimens, though clinical trials typically employed three-times-daily administration.

### Steady-State Kinetics

Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved within 3-4 days for hyperforin and 4-7 days for hypericin. Accumulation occurs with chronic dosing, particularly for hypericin due to its longer half-life. The time to steady state correlates with the delayed onset of clinical effects, suggesting that sustained exposure is required for neurochemical adaptations underlying antidepressant response.

### Drug Interaction Implications

The pharmacokinetic profile predicts significant drug interactions through multiple mechanisms:

- Enzyme induction: Hyperforin induces CYP450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein, reducing exposure to substrate drugs
- Transporter effects: P-glycoprotein induction affects drug absorption and brain penetration
- Pharmacodynamic interactions: Combined serotonergic effects increase serotonin syndrome risk

These interactions have major clinical significance and require careful medication review before initiating SJW therapy.

## Evidence Summary for Clinical Indications

This section provides a comprehensive evidence map for St. John's Wort across various clinical conditions, with evidence grades assigned based on quality and consistency of available research.

### Evidence Grading System

- **Grade A:** Strong evidence from multiple well-designed RCTs and meta-analyses, consistent findings
- **Grade B:** Moderate evidence from some RCTs, generally consistent findings with minor limitations
- **Grade C:** Limited evidence from small or poorly designed studies, inconsistent findings
- **Grade D:** Inadequate evidence or evidence of lack of efficacy

## Depression (Evidence Grade A)

St. John's Wort has the strongest evidence base for mild to moderate depression, with extensive research demonstrating efficacy comparable to conventional antidepressants.

### Evidence Summary

**Mechanism:** Hyperforin and hypericin regulate monoamine neurotransmitters, similar in outcome to SSRIs but via multiple pathways. This multi-pathway approach distinguishes SJW from selective reuptake inhibitors.

**Key Clinical Studies:**

**Study 1 - Mild Depression with Somatic Symptoms:** [PMID: 7857500]
- Demonstrated significant symptom relief versus placebo
- Supports use for depression with physical symptoms

**Study 2 - Mild to Moderate Depression:** [PMID: 9684948]
- Found comparable efficacy to low-dose tricyclic antidepressants
- Fewer side effects than conventional antidepressants
- Supports SJW as alternative to pharmaceutical antidepressants

**Study 3 - Standardized Hyperforin Extract:** (herbs.org)
- Reported improved mood stability and energy
- Low adverse-event rate
- Demonstrates importance of standardization

**Meta-Analysis:** According to PubMed, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 37 double-blind randomized controlled trials found that larger placebo-controlled trials restricted to patients with major depression showed minor effects over placebo, while older and smaller trials not restricted to patients with major depression showed marked effects. Compared with standard antidepressants, Hypericum extracts had similar effects ([DOI: 10.1192/bjp.186.2.99](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.186.2.99)).

Meta-analytic findings indicate:
- Superior efficacy compared to placebo in mild-moderate depression
- Comparable efficacy to standard antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs)
- Better tolerability profile than conventional antidepressants
- Response rates of 50-60% in appropriately selected patients
- Lower discontinuation rates due to adverse effects

### Clinical Interpretation

The evidence strongly supports SJW as a first-line treatment option for mild to moderate depressive episodes, particularly in patients who:
- Prefer natural or herbal therapies
- Have experienced intolerable side effects from conventional antidepressants
- Have no contraindicated medications
- Do not have severe or treatment-resistant depression

SJW is NOT recommended for:
- Severe major depressive disorder
- Bipolar depression (risk of mania induction)
- Psychotic depression
- Treatment-resistant depression

### Onset and Duration of Effect

Clinical improvement typically begins after 2-4 weeks of continuous use, with maximum effects achieved by 6-8 weeks. This delayed onset is consistent with conventional antidepressants and reflects time required for neuroadaptive changes. Patients should be counseled about this expected timeframe to maintain adherence during the initial treatment period.

## Anxiety Disorders

Evidence for anxiety disorders is mixed, with efficacy varying by specific anxiety disorder subtype.

### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Evidence Grade B)

**Mechanism:** The same serotonergic and GABA-modulating effects that relieve depression may also relieve mild anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disturbance.

**Clinical Evidence:**
- Limited but promising evidence suggests potential benefit for generalized anxiety disorder
- Several small trials and case reports demonstrate anxiolytic effects
- Benefits appear after 2-4 weeks of consistent use (similar to antidepressant effects)
- Larger controlled trials are needed

**Clinical Application:** SJW may be considered for mild anxiety, particularly when anxiety co-occurs with depressive symptoms. The GABAergic and serotonergic effects provide theoretical rationale for anxiolytic activity.

### Social Anxiety Disorder (Evidence Grade C)

Very limited evidence from small open-label trials. Insufficient data to recommend for this indication. The GABAergic and serotonergic effects provide theoretical rationale, but controlled trials are lacking.

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (Evidence Grade D)

According to PubMed, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found no significant difference between St. John's Wort and placebo for OCD. The mean change on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) with St. John's wort (3.43) was not significantly different than with placebo (3.60). The percentage of patients rated as 'much' or 'very much' improved at endpoint was not significantly different between groups (17.9% vs 16.7%) ([DOI: 10.1097/00004850-200511000-00003](https://doi.org/10.1097/00004850-200511000-00003)). **Not recommended** for OCD based on current evidence.

### Panic Disorder (Evidence Grade C)

Insufficient evidence from controlled trials. Some case reports suggest potential benefit, but systematic research is needed.

## Somatic Symptom Disorder (Evidence Grade A)

St. John's Wort demonstrates strong efficacy for somatoform disorders (now termed somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5).

### Evidence Summary

According to PubMed, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 184 outpatients with somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform autonomic dysfunction found that 600 mg of SJW extract LI 160 daily demonstrated statistically significant medium to large-sized superiority over placebo across all six primary efficacy measures (p <.0001). Of the SJW patients, 45.4% were classified as responders compared with 20.9% with placebo (p =.0006). Tolerability was equivalent to placebo ([DOI: 10.1097/01.psy.0000128900.13711.5b](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.psy.0000128900.13711.5b)).

### Clinical Application

SJW represents an evidence-based option for patients presenting with:
- Medically unexplained somatic symptoms
- Multiple somatic complaints without adequate medical explanation
- Somatic symptom disorder with prominent physical symptoms
- Somatoform autonomic dysfunction

The mechanism likely involves both central nervous system effects on symptom perception and potential anxiolytic/antidepressant effects that reduce distress associated with somatic symptoms.

### Dosing for Somatic Symptoms

Clinical trials used 600 mg daily (300 mg BID) of standardized extract (LI 160). Treatment duration of at least 6 weeks is recommended to assess response. Continuation therapy for 3-6 months is appropriate for responders.

## Premenstrual Syndrome (Evidence Grade B)

St. John's Wort shows moderate evidence for reducing PMS symptoms, particularly physical and behavioral symptoms.

### Evidence Summary

According to PubMed, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study found that daily treatment with Hypericum perforatum was more effective than placebo for the most common physical and behavioral symptoms associated with PMS. Women received 900 mg/day standardized to 0.18% hypericin and 3.38% hyperforin. Physical and behavioral symptoms improved significantly (p < 0.05), though mood- and pain-related symptoms did not show significant differences ([DOI: 10.2165/11530120-000000000-00000](https://doi.org/10.2165/11530120-000000000-00000)).

### Clinical Interpretation

SJW may be particularly beneficial for PMS patients with:
- Prominent physical symptoms (bloating, breast tenderness, fatigue)
- Behavioral symptoms (irritability, difficulty concentrating)
- Preference for non-hormonal interventions
- Contraindications to hormonal therapies

Mood and pain symptoms may require adjunctive therapies. The serotonergic mechanism provides theoretical support for PMS symptom improvement, as serotonin dysregulation is implicated in PMS pathophysiology.

### Treatment Protocol

Begin treatment in the luteal phase (2 weeks before expected menses) or use continuous daily dosing. Typical dose is 900 mg daily (300 mg TID) of standardized extract. Assess response over 2-3 menstrual cycles before determining efficacy. Combine with lifestyle modifications (exercise, stress management, dietary changes) for optimal outcomes.

## Menopausal Symptoms (Evidence Grade B)

St. John's Wort demonstrates moderate evidence for improving menopausal quality of life, particularly mood symptoms and sleep disturbances.

### Evidence Summary

According to PubMed, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 47 perimenopausal women found that after 12 weeks of treatment with 900 mg TID of St. John's wort extract, women reported significantly better menopause-specific quality of life (p = 0.01) and significantly fewer sleep problems (p = 0.05) compared to placebo. Hot flash frequency showed a nonsignificant trend favoring SJW ([DOI: 10.1097/gme.0b013e31818572a0](https://doi.org/10.1097/gme.0b013e31818572a0)).

### Clinical Application

SJW may benefit menopausal women experiencing:
- Mood disturbances associated with menopause
- Sleep difficulties
- Reduced quality of life due to menopausal transition
- Preference for non-hormonal approaches

SJW appears less effective for vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) compared to hormonal therapies, though combination products with black cohosh show promise. The primary benefit appears to be improving psychological well-being and sleep rather than directly treating hot flashes.

### Combination Therapy

Some trials have evaluated SJW combined with black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) for comprehensive menopausal symptom management. The combination may provide complementary benefits, with black cohosh targeting vasomotor symptoms and SJW addressing mood and sleep concerns.

## Seasonal Affective Disorder (Evidence Grade C)

Limited evidence suggests potential benefit for SAD, but more research is needed.

### Evidence Summary

Few controlled trials have specifically examined SJW for SAD. Some open-label trials and case series suggest benefit, and the antidepressant mechanism provides theoretical support. However, light therapy remains the first-line treatment for SAD with stronger evidence. SJW might serve as an adjunctive treatment or alternative for patients unable to use light therapy.

## Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Evidence Grade D)

Current evidence does not support use of SJW for ADHD.

### Evidence Summary

Limited research in ADHD has not demonstrated significant benefit. The mechanism of action does not strongly target the dopaminergic pathways most relevant to ADHD symptomatology. **Not recommended** for ADHD based on current evidence.

## Other Potential Applications (Insufficient Evidence)

### Smoking Cessation (Evidence Grade C)

Small trials have examined SJW for smoking cessation with mixed results. While the antidepressant effects might theoretically help with mood symptoms during cessation, evidence is insufficient to recommend this use.

### Neuropathic Pain (Evidence Grade C)

Some animal studies and limited human trials suggest potential for neuropathic pain, possibly through anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory effects. However, evidence is currently insufficient for clinical recommendation.

### Topical Applications (Evidence Grade C)

**Traditional Use:** External preparations (oils, salves) are traditionally used for minor burns, neuralgia, wounds, and bruises.

**Mechanism:** Topical applications promote epithelial repair via astringent and antimicrobial activity. Flavonoids and phenolic acids contribute to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may support wound healing and skin health.

**Clinical Applications:**
- Wound healing
- Minor burns
- Neuralgia (nerve pain)
- Bruises
- Atopic dermatitis
- Pressure ulcers

**Clinical Evidence:** Limited evidence suggests potential benefit through anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, but more research is needed. Topical use is generally safe and non-interacting (unlike internal use).

**Safety:** Topical use is generally safe and does not carry the same drug interaction risks as internal use.

### Antiviral Applications (Evidence Grade D - Experimental Only)

**Mechanism:** Hypericin has shown in vitro inhibition of several enveloped viruses (HIV, influenza, herpes simplex) through photodynamic mechanisms. The photosensitizing naphthodianthrone properties of hypericin underlie this activity.

**In Vitro Evidence:**
- Demonstrated activity against HIV
- Activity against influenza viruses
- Activity against herpes simplex virus
- Mechanism involves photodynamic properties (light-activated)

**Clinical Status:** Clinical translation has been unsuccessful, and SJW should **not** be used for antiviral purposes. These remain experimental applications requiring further research.

**Note:** While hypericin demonstrates antiviral potential in laboratory settings, internal use of SJW for viral infections is not recommended due to lack of clinical evidence and significant drug interaction risks.

## Safety Profile and Adverse Effects

St. John's Wort is generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile compared to conventional antidepressants. However, specific adverse effects and contraindications require careful clinical consideration.

### Common Adverse Effects (Incidence 1-10%)

**Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, loss of appetite. These effects are usually mild and may diminish with continued use. Taking SJW with food can reduce GI symptoms.

**Neurological:** Headache, dizziness, restlessness, fatigue, sedation. These effects are typically less frequent than with conventional antidepressants.

**Dermatological:** Photosensitivity reactions, particularly in fair-skinned individuals at higher doses. Patients should be advised to use sun protection and avoid excessive UV exposure, including tanning beds.

**Other:** Dry mouth, insomnia or vivid dreams (less common), sexual dysfunction (rare, much less frequent than with SSRIs).

### Serious Adverse Effects (Rare)

**Psychiatric:** Mania or hypomania induction, particularly in patients with undiagnosed bipolar disorder or vulnerability to mood elevation. Case reports document SJW-induced manic episodes. Screen for bipolar disorder history before initiating treatment.

**Serotonin Syndrome:** When combined with other serotonergic agents (SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tramadol, etc.), SJW can contribute to serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities.

**Photosensitivity:** Severe photosensitivity reactions can occur, especially at high doses or in combination with other photosensitizing medications. Hypericin's photodynamic properties underlie this risk.

**Allergic Reactions:** Rare hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, and very rarely anaphylaxis.

### Discontinuation Effects

Unlike many conventional antidepressants, SJW appears to have minimal discontinuation symptoms. No significant withdrawal syndrome has been documented in clinical trials. However, gradual discontinuation over 1-2 weeks is prudent to avoid potential mood relapse.

## Contraindications and Cautions

### Absolute Contraindications

**Severe Depression or Suicidal Ideation:** SJW is not appropriate for severe major depressive disorder. Patients with suicidal ideation require more intensive treatment with proven efficacy.

**Bipolar Disorder:** Risk of mania induction contraindicates use in bipolar disorder without mood stabilizer coverage.

**Concurrent Use of Certain Medications:** Due to extensive drug interactions (detailed below), SJW is contraindicated with:
- Immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
- Antiretrovirals (especially protease inhibitors and NNRTIs)
- Chemotherapeutic agents metabolized by CYP450
- Other antidepressants (risk of serotonin syndrome)

**Photosensitivity Disorders:** Patients with porphyria or other photosensitivity conditions should avoid SJW.

**Known Hypersensitivity:** Prior allergic reaction to SJW or Hypericum species.

### Relative Contraindications and Cautions

**Schizophrenia or Psychotic Disorders:** Risk of symptom exacerbation; use with caution and only under specialist supervision.

**Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia:** Potential for confusion or cognitive effects; careful monitoring required.

**ADHD Medications:** When combined with stimulants, increased monitoring for side effects is warranted.

**Surgery:** Discontinue 1-2 weeks before elective surgery due to:
- Potential effects on anesthesia metabolism
- Interaction with perioperative medications
- Theoretical increased bleeding risk

**Fertility Treatment:** Discontinue before assisted reproductive technology due to potential effects on reproductive hormones and gamete function.

## Pregnancy and Lactation

### Pregnancy (Category: Insufficient Safety Data)

Animal studies have not demonstrated teratogenic effects at typical doses, but human pregnancy data are limited. Several considerations apply:

**First Trimester:** Avoid use due to insufficient safety data during organogenesis. No adequate controlled studies in pregnant women exist.

**Second and Third Trimesters:** Use only if benefit clearly outweighs potential risk. Consider that depression during pregnancy also carries risks to both mother and fetus.

**Alternative Approaches:** For mild to moderate depression during pregnancy, psychotherapy (particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy) should be first-line. If pharmacotherapy is necessary, consultation with a perinatal mental health specialist is recommended to weigh risks and benefits of conventional antidepressants versus untreated depression.

### Lactation (Use with Caution)

**Excretion in Breast Milk:** Hyperforin, hypericin, and other constituents are excreted in breast milk. Concentrations vary but can reach levels that could potentially affect nursing infants.

**Infant Effects:** Limited data from case reports suggest minimal adverse effects in breastfed infants, though data are insufficient to ensure safety. Reported observations include colic and drowsiness in some exposed infants.

**Clinical Recommendations:**
- Avoid during the early postpartum period (first 2-4 weeks)
- If use is deemed necessary, monitor infant closely for unusual behaviors including excessive drowsiness, poor feeding, or colic
- Consider monitoring infant for photosensitivity
- Breastfeeding mothers should be informed of limited safety data

**Alternative Considerations:** Postpartum depression requires appropriate treatment. Evidence-based psychotherapy should be first-line, with conventional antidepressants (particularly sertraline or paroxetine with more established breastfeeding safety data) considered when pharmacotherapy is necessary.

## Drug Interactions (Critical Clinical Concern)

St. John's Wort has extensive and clinically significant drug interaction potential. This represents the most important safety consideration in clinical practice and requires thorough medication review before initiating therapy.

### Mechanism of Interactions

**Primary Mechanism:** SJW induces hepatic CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, accelerating drug metabolism and lowering serum concentrations. This occurs through pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation by hyperforin.

According to PubMed research, SJW's interactions occur primarily through pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation by hyperforin, leading to induction of:

- Cytochrome P450 enzymes (particularly CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19)
- P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter
- Other drug transporters

This induction reduces plasma concentrations and efficacy of substrate medications. The magnitude of induction is dose-dependent and correlates with hyperforin content. Low-hyperforin preparations (≤1 mg/day) demonstrate minimal enzyme induction ([DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00054](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00054)).

**Clinical Significance:** This mechanism explains why SJW reduces levels of many medications, including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, and antiretrovirals. Topical use is generally safe and non-interacting, as it does not result in systemic enzyme induction.

### Major Drug Interactions (Clinically Significant)

**Immunosuppressants (Critical - Contraindicated):**
- Cyclosporine: 30-70% reduction in plasma levels, documented cases of transplant rejection
- Tacrolimus: Significant reduction in levels with risk of rejection
- Sirolimus, everolimus: Expected similar reductions

**Clinical Significance:** Cases of organ rejection following SJW initiation are documented. Absolute contraindication in transplant recipients.

**Antiretrovirals (Critical - Contraindicated):**
- Protease inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir): Substantial reductions (50-80%) in plasma concentrations
- NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine): Reduced efficacy
- Integrase inhibitors: Potential for reduced efficacy

**Clinical Significance:** Risk of treatment failure and viral resistance development. Absolute contraindication in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy.

**Anticoagulants (Critical):**
- Warfarin: Reduced INR and anticoagulant effect through CYP2C9 induction
- Novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, apixaban): Reduced plasma levels

**Clinical Significance:** Cases of subtherapeutic anticoagulation documented. If concomitant use unavoidable, intensive INR monitoring required. Consider alternative antidepressant.

**Contraceptives (Major):**
- Oral contraceptives: Increased estrogen and progestin metabolism
- Hormonal patches, rings: Similar interaction expected

**Clinical Significance:** Multiple case reports of unplanned pregnancies. Patients using hormonal contraception should use additional contraceptive methods or choose alternative antidepressant. Alternative contraceptive counseling is essential.

**Cardiovascular Medications:**
- Digoxin: Reduced plasma levels through P-glycoprotein induction, risk of therapeutic failure
- Ivabradine: Reduced efficacy
- Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem): Reduced plasma levels

**Clinical Significance:** Risk of cardiovascular decompensation in cardiac patients. Generally contraindicated in patients on digoxin.

**Anticonvulsants:**
- Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital: Bidirectional interaction with reduced levels of both agents
- Lamotrigine: Potential for reduced efficacy

**Clinical Significance:** Cases of breakthrough seizures documented. Absolute contraindication in epilepsy patients without careful specialist supervision and therapeutic monitoring.

**Chemotherapeutic Agents:**
- Irinotecan: Reduced efficacy
- Imatinib: Decreased plasma concentrations
- Methotrexate: Potential interaction

**Clinical Significance:** Risk of cancer treatment failure. Absolutely contraindicated during cancer chemotherapy.

**Statins:**
- Simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin: Reduced plasma levels

**Clinical Significance:** Reduced lipid-lowering efficacy, potential for cardiovascular events. Monitor lipid levels if concurrent use necessary.

**Benzodiazepines:**
- Midazolam, alprazolam: Reduced plasma concentrations and duration of effect

**Clinical Significance:** Reduced anxiolytic efficacy. Consider alternative antidepressant or benzodiazepine dose adjustment.

### Pharmacodynamic Interactions

**Serotonergic Medications (Major - Contraindicated):**
- SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram)
- SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine)
- Tricyclic antidepressants
- MAO inhibitors
- Triptans (sumatriptan, etc.)
- Tramadol, tapentadol
- Dextromethorphan
- Linezolid

**Clinical Significance:** Risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. Symptoms include altered mental status, autonomic instability (hyperthermia, tachycardia, labile blood pressure), and neuromuscular abnormalities (hyperreflexia, clonus, rigidity).

**Management:** Absolute contraindication for concurrent use. When switching between SJW and serotonergic medications:
- From SJW to SSRI: 1-2 week washout period
- From SSRI to SJW: Washout period depends on SSRI half-life (5 weeks for fluoxetine, 1-2 weeks for others)

**Photosensitizing Medications:**
- Fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines
- Thiazide diuretics
- Sulfonamides
- NSAIDs (naproxen, piroxicam)

**Clinical Significance:** Additive photosensitivity risk. Enhanced sun protection essential. Consider alternative antidepressant in patients requiring long-term photosensitizing medications.

### Medications with Moderate Interactions

**Theophylline:** Reduced plasma levels, potential for respiratory symptom worsening in COPD/asthma patients

**Omeprazole and PPIs:** Reduced acid suppression efficacy through CYP2C19 induction

**Beta-blockers:** Potential for reduced efficacy of some agents

**Opioids:** Theoretical reduction in efficacy of some opioid analgesics

**Hormones (thyroid, corticosteroids):** Potential for altered hormone levels

### Clinical Management of Drug Interactions

**Before Initiating SJW:**
1. Complete medication review including prescription, OTC, and other supplements
2. Assess for absolute contraindications (immunosuppressants, antiretrovirals, anticoagulants, etc.)
3. Evaluate all potential moderate interactions
4. Consider low-hyperforin preparation if interactions are a concern but SJW is strongly desired
5. Document patient counseling regarding interaction risks

**During SJW Therapy:**
1. Monitor for loss of efficacy of concurrent medications
2. Adjust doses of interacting medications as needed (though generally not recommended)
3. Educate patients to inform all healthcare providers about SJW use
4. Counsel patients not to initiate new medications without consulting prescriber

**Special Considerations for Low-Hyperforin Preparations:**
- Contain <1 mg hyperforin per daily dose
- Minimal CYP450 enzyme induction
- Reduced drug interaction potential
- May have reduced antidepressant efficacy compared to high-hyperforin extracts
- Consider for patients with potential interaction concerns

## Dosage and Administration

Proper dosing of St. John's Wort requires consideration of indication, extract standardization, and individual patient factors. Clinical trials provide evidence-based dosing guidance.

### Standardized Extract Specifications

Most clinical trials used extracts standardized to:
- **Hypericin:** 0.3% (range 0.1-0.5%)
- **Hyperforin:** 2-5% (standard preparations) or <1% (low-hyperforin preparations)
- **Drug-to-extract ratio:** Typically 3-7:1 (meaning 3-7 kg of dried herb produces 1 kg of extract)

Common proprietary extracts studied in trials include:
- LI 160 (Lichtwer Pharma)
- WS 5570 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe)
- STW-3 (Steigerwald Arzneimittel)
- Ze 117 (Zeller AG)

### Depression Dosing

**Initial Dose:** 300 mg three times daily (900 mg total daily dose) of standardized extract

**Titration:** If response is inadequate after 4-6 weeks, may increase to 1,200 mg daily (400 mg TID) or 1,800 mg daily (600 mg TID) in divided doses

**Maintenance:** Continue effective dose for minimum 6-12 months after symptom resolution to prevent relapse

**Duration to Assess Response:** Minimum 4 weeks, optimal assessment at 6-8 weeks

**Administration:** With or without food; taking with meals may reduce GI effects

### Somatic Symptom Disorder Dosing

**Standard Dose:** 300 mg twice daily (600 mg total daily dose) of standardized extract

**Duration:** Minimum 6 weeks to assess efficacy; continue for 3-6 months in responders

### Premenstrual Syndrome Dosing

**Standard Dose:** 300 mg three times daily (900 mg total daily dose)

**Timing Options:**
- Continuous daily dosing throughout menstrual cycle, OR
- Luteal phase dosing (beginning 14 days before expected menses)

**Assessment Period:** Evaluate over 2-3 menstrual cycles before determining efficacy

### Menopausal Symptoms Dosing

**Standard Dose:** 300 mg three times daily (900 mg total daily dose)

**Duration:** Minimum 8-12 weeks to assess efficacy

**Combination Therapy:** May be combined with black cohosh for comprehensive symptom management; follow product-specific dosing

### Anxiety Disorders Dosing (Where Evidence Supports Use)

**Standard Dose:** 300 mg three times daily (900 mg total daily dose)

**Duration:** Minimum 4-6 weeks to assess anxiolytic effects

### Special Population Dosing

**Elderly Patients (>65 years):**
- Initiate at lower end of dosing range (600 mg daily)
- Titrate slowly based on response and tolerability
- More careful monitoring for drug interactions due to polypharmacy
- Consider lower-hyperforin preparations to minimize interaction risk

**Pediatric Use:**
- Safety and efficacy not established in children under 18 years
- Limited data from small trials in adolescents with depression
- Not routinely recommended for pediatric use

**Hepatic Impairment:**
- No specific dosing adjustments established
- Use with caution due to hepatic metabolism
- Consider lower doses and careful monitoring

**Renal Impairment:**
- No specific dosing adjustments required
- Primary elimination is hepatic, not renal

### Administration Guidelines

**Timing:**
- Divide total daily dose into 2-3 administrations throughout the day
- Morning and midday dosing may be preferred to minimize potential sleep effects
- Consistent daily timing helps maintain steady plasma levels

**With or Without Food:**
- Can be taken with or without meals
- Taking with food may reduce gastrointestinal side effects
- Fatty meals may enhance absorption of lipophilic constituents

**Missed Dose:**
- Take as soon as remembered if within several hours of scheduled time
- Skip if close to next scheduled dose
- Do not double doses to make up for missed dose

**Storage:**
- Store in cool, dry place away from direct sunlight
- Hyperforin is light-sensitive and degrades with exposure
- Keep in original container to protect from light and moisture
- Check expiration date; do not use expired products

### Switching Between Antidepressants

**From SJW to Conventional Antidepressant:**
1. Discontinue SJW
2. Wait 1-2 weeks (washout period)
3. Initiate conventional antidepressant at standard starting dose
4. Monitor closely for treatment response and adverse effects

**From Conventional Antidepressant to SJW:**
1. Gradually taper conventional antidepressant according to standard protocols
2. Complete washout period:
   - Most SSRIs/SNRIs: 1-2 weeks after discontinuation
   - Fluoxetine: 5 weeks after discontinuation (due to long half-life)
3. Initiate SJW at standard starting dose
4. Monitor for adequate response and absence of discontinuation symptoms

**Never:** Abruptly switch between SJW and conventional antidepressants without appropriate washout period due to serotonin syndrome risk.

### Treatment Duration and Discontinuation

**Acute Treatment Phase:** 8-12 weeks to achieve full response

**Continuation Phase:** 6-12 months after symptom resolution to prevent relapse

**Discontinuation:**
- Gradual taper not typically necessary (minimal withdrawal effects)
- However, prudent to reduce dose gradually over 1-2 weeks
- Monitor for mood relapse during discontinuation period
- Some patients may require long-term maintenance therapy

### Quality Considerations and Product Selection

**Selecting High-Quality SJW Products:**

1. **Standardization:**
   - Look for products standardized to 0.3% hypericin and 2-5% hyperforin
   - Verify stated concentration is per dose, not per product
   - Choose products that match clinical trial extracts when possible

2. **Quality Certifications:**
   - USP Verified or NSF Certified for Sport marks
   - GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certification
   - Independent third-party testing (ConsumerLab.com, etc.)

3. **Manufacturer Reputation:**
   - Established manufacturers with quality track record
   - Transparent about sourcing and manufacturing
   - Provides lot-specific certificates of analysis

4. **Product Stability:**
   - Properly packaged to protect from light (dark bottles)
   - Appropriate expiration dating
   - Storage recommendations included

5. **Avoid:**
   - Products without standardization information
   - Unrealistic claims about efficacy
   - Combination products with multiple herbs (unless specifically studied)
   - Suspiciously low-priced products

**Issues with Quality Variability:**
- Significant variability exists in commercial products
- Studies have found some products contain subtherapeutic levels of active constituents
- Hypericin and especially hyperforin degrade over time
- Quality issues may explain treatment failures

### Integration with Psychotherapy

SJW should be considered as one component of comprehensive treatment:

**Combination with Psychotherapy:**
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has strong evidence for depression
- Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is also evidence-based
- Combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy often superior to either alone
- Particularly important for:
  - Recurrent depression
  - Significant psychosocial stressors
  - Personality factors contributing to depression
  - Skills deficits (coping, interpersonal)

**Lifestyle Interventions:**
- Regular exercise (aerobic activity 3-5 times weekly)
- Sleep hygiene optimization
- Stress management techniques
- Social support enhancement
- Nutritional adequacy
- Reduction of alcohol and substance use

### Special Clinical Situations

**Treatment-Resistant Depression:**
- If patient fails trial of SJW, consider:
  - Reassessment of diagnosis
  - Evaluation for contributing factors (thyroid, substance use, etc.)
  - Switch to conventional antidepressant
  - Psychiatric consultation
  - More intensive interventions

**Comorbid Anxiety:**
- May benefit from SJW's anxiolytic effects
- Consider combination with psychotherapy (CBT)
- If anxiety predominant, benzodiazepine may be needed short-term (note interaction)

**Chronic Pain:**
- Depression commonly comorbid with chronic pain
- SJW may address depressive component
- Comprehensive pain management approach needed

**Substance Use Disorders:**
- Address substance use as priority
- Motivational interviewing
- SJW may help with mood once substance use stabilized
- Be aware of medication interactions in substance use treatment
