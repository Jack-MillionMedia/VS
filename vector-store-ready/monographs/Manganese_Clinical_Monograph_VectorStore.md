## Main Topic

Manganese (Mn, atomic number 25) is an essential trace element required in small amounts for human health. It functions mainly as a cofactor for multiple enzymes, including manganese superoxide dismutase, arginase and pyruvate carboxylase, and plays key roles in amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, antioxidant defense, bone formation, reproduction and immune function. The body contains ~10–20 mg Mn, with ~25–40% stored in bone; most circulating Mn is bound to transferrin, albumin and α₂‑macroglobulin.

## Recommended Intakes & Upper Limits

The Food and Nutrition Board set **Adequate Intakes (AI)** for manganese (insufficient data for RDAs) and a **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)** to prevent toxicity.

| Age / physiological state | AI (mg/day) – male | AI (mg/day) – female | UL (mg/day)     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| **Birth – 6 months**      | 0.003              | 0.003                | Not established |
| **7–12 months**           | 0.6                | 0.6                  | Not established |
| **1–3 y**                 | 1.2                | 1.2                  | 2               |
| **4–8 y**                 | 1.5                | 1.5                  | 3               |
| **9–13 y**                | 1.9                | 1.6                  | 6               |
| **14–18 y**               | 2.2                | 1.6                  | 9               |
| **19+ y**                 | 2.3                | 1.8                  | 11              |
| **Pregnancy**             | —                  | 2.0                  | 11              |
| **Lactation**             | —                  | 2.6                  | 11              |

*Note*: The adult UL of **11 mg/day** applies to total intake from food and supplements; toxicity from food alone is rare.

## Dietary Sources

Manganese is widely distributed in foods, with richest sources in plant foods:

- **Plant foods**: Nuts (hazelnuts, pecans), whole grains (oats, brown rice), legumes (soybeans, lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans), leafy greens (spinach), and fruits such as pineapple.  
- **Animal foods**: Shellfish (mussels, oysters, clams).  
- **Beverages/seasonings**: Black tea and spices (e.g., black pepper).  
- **Water**: Drinking water contributes small amounts; concentrations vary regionally.

Most people obtain adequate Mn from a balanced diet; deficiency in free-living populations is exceptionally rare.

## Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism & Excretion (ADME)

- **Absorption**:
  - Occurs mainly via active transport in the duodenum and jejunum.  
  - Absorption increases when **iron intake is low**, as Mn and iron share transporters (competition at enterocyte level).

- **Distribution**:
  - After absorption, Mn circulates bound to transferrin, albumin and α₂‑macroglobulin and is taken up by the liver and other tissues.  
  - Bone is the primary storage site (≈25–40% of body Mn).

- **Metabolism**:
  - Cofactor for key enzymes:
    - **Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)**: mitochondrial antioxidant defense.  
    - **Arginase**: urea cycle.  
    - **Pyruvate carboxylase & PEPCK**: gluconeogenesis and energy metabolism.  
    - **Glycosyltransferases**: cartilage and bone matrix formation.

- **Excretion**:
  - Primarily via **biliary excretion into feces**; urinary Mn excretion is minimal.  
  - Impaired biliary function (e.g., liver disease) can increase body Mn burden.

---

## Clinical Uses

- **Nutritional supplementation**:
  - Mn is included in **parenteral nutrition** formulations to prevent deficiency in patients who cannot meet needs orally.  
  - Typical adult IV doses are in the **150–800 µg/day** range.  
  - Severe deficiency is rare but can occur in long-term TPN without Mn supplementation or in profound malabsorption.

- **Bone/joint health**:
  - Mn is sometimes included in combination supplements (e.g., with glucosamine/chondroitin) for osteoarthritis or bone health, but clinical evidence for added benefit is limited.

- **Metabolic support**:
  - Although Mn is involved in gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism, there is **no strong evidence** to support Mn supplementation for diabetes or metabolic disorders in individuals with adequate intake.

---

## Deficiency

True manganese deficiency is very rare due to its broad presence in foods.

- **Experimental/clinical deficiency features**:
  - Impaired bone growth and demineralization.  
  - Altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (e.g., abnormal glucose tolerance, hypocholesterolemia).  
  - Skin rash and poor wound healing.  
  - Possible reproductive and skeletal abnormalities.

- **At-risk populations**:
  - Individuals on long-term **parenteral nutrition** without Mn.  
  - Patients with severe **malabsorption syndromes** or extreme dietary restrictions.  
  - Possibly individuals with genetic disorders affecting metal transport, though data are limited.

## Toxicity & Adverse Effects

Manganese toxicity generally arises from **inhalation** or heavily contaminated water rather than normal dietary intake.

- **Chronic Mn overexposure (manganism)**:
  - Neuromotor and psychiatric signs resembling Parkinson’s disease:
    - Tremors, muscle spasms, impaired coordination and balance.  
    - Hearing loss, headaches.  
    - Mood changes (irritability, depression), cognitive deficits.  
    - Parkinsonian-like symptoms.

- **At-risk groups for toxicity**:
  - **Liver disease**: impaired biliary excretion may lead to Mn accumulation.  
  - **Iron-deficiency anemia**: enhanced Mn absorption due to shared transporters.  
  - **Infants** and older adults (>50 years): may be more sensitive to excess exposure.  
  - Individuals exposed to high-Mn occupational settings (e.g., welders, miners) or contaminated drinking water.

- **Supplementation caution**:
  - High-dose Mn supplements should be used only under medical supervision, particularly in those with liver disease or other risk factors for accumulation.

## Drug & Nutrient Interactions

- **Iron**:
  - Mn and iron share intestinal transporters; **high iron intake** reduces Mn absorption and vice versa.  
  - Iron status can influence Mn bioavailability and risk of deficiency/excess.

- **Calcium & antacids**:
  - Calcium carbonate and other multivalent cations can **reduce Mn absorption**; consider separating Mn and high-dose calcium/antacids by at least ~2 hours.

- **Tetracyclines & quinolone antibiotics**:
  - Mn can chelate these drugs, **reducing antibiotic bioavailability**; separate Mn-containing supplements from these antibiotics by at least 2 hours.

- **Metabolic/cardiac drugs (theoretical)**:
  - Because Mn enzymes influence glucose metabolism and neurological/cardiac function, high supplemental Mn could theoretically **potentiate** effects of antidiabetic or cardiac medications; monitor clinically if high intake is present.

---

## Special Populations

- **Pregnancy & lactation**:
  - AIs modestly higher (≈2.0–2.6 mg/day).  
  - Most women meet needs through diet; avoid unnecessary high-dose supplementation due to potential fetal/neonatal neurotoxicity risk at high exposures.

- **Infants & children**:
  - Requirements are low; breast milk and formula normally provide appropriate Mn levels.  
  - Avoid excessive Mn from **contaminated water** or unregulated formulas.

- **Liver impairment**:
  - Reduced biliary excretion → increased risk of Mn accumulation; avoid or minimize supplemental Mn and monitor for neurologic signs if exposure is high.

## Conclusion

Manganese is an essential micronutrient critical for multiple enzyme systems, antioxidant defenses, bone development and metabolic regulation. Most individuals consuming a varied diet easily meet manganese needs, and deficiency is rare outside of specialized settings such as long-term parenteral nutrition. Clinicians should prioritize ensuring appropriate Mn provision in TPN and remain vigilant for potential Mn overload in patients with liver disease, iron deficiency, high environmental exposure or impaired excretion. Routine high-dose supplementation is generally unnecessary and may pose neurotoxicity risks when intakes exceed the UL.
