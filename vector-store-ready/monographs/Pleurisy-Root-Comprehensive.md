## Quick Reference: Clinician TL;DR

### Evidence Grade Summary

**Respiratory Conditions: Evidence Grade D**
- Key finding: Historical pharmacopoeial use (USP 1820-1905, NF 1916-1936), extensive traditional use
- Clinical bottom line: Traditional expectorant and respiratory support, limited modern research

### Clinical Bottom Line

**When to Use:**
- Respiratory conditions (traditional use, Grade D)
- Pleurisy, bronchitis, pneumonia (traditional use)
- Expectorant needs (traditional use)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Pregnancy (insufficient modern safety data)
- Known allergy to Apocynaceae/Asclepiadaceae family

### Safety Snapshot

- **Overall Safety Rating:** Good (traditional use, historical safety)
- **Most Common AE:** None reported in traditional use
- **Critical Safety Concerns:** Pregnancy (insufficient data)
- **Drug Interactions:** Unknown (insufficient data)

### Standard Dosing

**Traditional:** 1-2g dried root decoction, 2-3 times daily  
**Tincture:** 2-4 mL, 2-3 times daily (traditional)

### Key Clinical Pearl

Pleurisy Root was official in U.S. Pharmacopoeia for 85 years (1820-1905), indicating historical acceptance. Traditional use focuses on respiratory conditions - stimulates vagus nerve, promotes expectoration, bronchial dilation. Modern research limited - use based on traditional knowledge with appropriate expectations.
