## Clinical Decision Support

**CATEGORY:** Clinical Practice Guidelines

### IF/THEN Decision Rules

**IF** a patient presents with acute bronchitis or persistent cough, **THEN** consider thyme (alone or in combination with other respiratory herbs) as supportive therapy, with German Commission E recognition providing regulatory validation. Monitor for improvement within 5-7 days.

**IF** a patient has digestive complaints with bloating, gas, or cramping, **THEN** recommend thyme tea or extract for antispasmodic effects, as part of comprehensive digestive support protocol.

**IF** a patient is taking antihypertensive medications, **THEN** counsel on potential additive blood pressure-lowering effects, recommend close blood pressure monitoring, and coordinate with prescribing physician for potential medication adjustment.

**IF** a patient has infected wounds or skin conditions, **THEN** consider topical application of diluted thyme essential oil (1-2% in carrier oil), ensuring proper dilution and patch testing first.

**IF** a patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, **THEN** recommend caution with therapeutic doses and avoid essential oil use; culinary amounts are generally considered safe.

**IF** a patient has known allergy to Lamiaceae family plants (mint, basil, oregano, sage), **THEN** contraindicate thyme use due to cross-reactivity risk.

### Clinical Pearls
