## Clinician TL;DR

- **Vitex agnus-castus (VAC)**:
  - **Primary indications**: PMS (esp. physical symptoms), cyclic mastalgia, mild hyperprolactinaemia, luteal phase defect, some menstrual irregularities.  
  - **Mechanisms**:
    - **Dopaminergic (D₂) agonism** in the pituitary → ↓ prolactin → improved luteal progesterone, mastalgia, menstrual regularity.  
    - **Opioid (μ, κ) receptor affinity** and central neuromodulation contributing to PMS symptom relief.  
    - Flavonoids (apigenin, vitexin, casticin) with preferential **ERβ modulation** and selective estrogen receptor modulation; anti-inflammatory effects via lipoxygenase and cytokine inhibition.
  - **Evidence**: Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show VAC significantly improves PMS and mastalgia vs placebo and is comparable to fluoxetine (for PMDD) and bromocriptine (for hyperprolactinemia/mastalgia) with better tolerability.
- **Vitex negundo**:
  - **Primary indications (regulatory/clinical practice)**: Non-bacterial acute cough and some musculoskeletal pain indications (often in combination formulas).  
  - **Mechanisms**: Strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions via prostaglandin and COX‑2 inhibition; antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-androgenic, cardioprotective, and antimicrobial effects demonstrated preclinically.
- **Vitex doniana**:
  - Preclinical-only; shows potent antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, anticancer and antidiabetic effects, but lacks human clinical trials.
- **Key cautions**:
  - VAC: Avoid in **pregnancy, lactation, and pituitary tumors**; potential CYP2C19/CYP3A4 inhibition; theoretical dopaminergic interactions.  
  - V. negundo: Documented PK interaction with **paracetamol** (↑ exposure) and regulatory warnings against unregistered products; monitor hepatotoxicity risk.  
  - V. doniana: Insufficient human data; restrict to research settings.

## Phytochemistry & Mechanisms

### Vitex agnus-castus

- **Key compounds**:
  - Diterpenes (e.g., rotundifuran, clerodadienol), flavonoids (casticin, vitexin, quercetagetin, apigenin), iridoids (agnuside), essential oils (1,8-cineole), and lipophilic fractions containing linoleic acid.

- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Pituitary dopaminergic activity**: D₂ receptor agonism → ↓ prolactin secretion, especially in latent or mild hyperprolactinaemia.  
  - **Estrogen receptor modulation**: Flavonoids show preferential binding to **ERβ**; some lipophilic fractions bind ERα/ERβ but act as selective modulators rather than full agonists.  
  - **Opioidergic activity**: Affinity for μ and κ opioid receptors may contribute to analgesic and mood-modulating effects.  
  - **Anti-inflammatory**: Constituents like casticin and vitexin inhibit lipoxygenase and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines.

### Vitex negundo

- **Key compounds**:
  - Flavonoids (vitexin, isovitexin, casticin), terpenoids (betulinic, ursolic, oleanolic acids), essential oils (linalool, α‑pinene), alkaloids (negundoside).

- **Mechanisms**:
  - Analgesic/anti-inflammatory via prostaglandin and COX‑2 inhibition; ↓ TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6; ↑ IL‑10.  
  - Antioxidant and hepatoprotective by restoring antioxidant enzymes and ↓ lipid peroxidation.  
  - Anti-androgenic (↓ serum testosterone in PCOS models).  
  - Cardioprotective in preclinical models of MI, hypertrophy and atherosclerosis.

### Vitex doniana

- **Key compounds**:
  - Triterpenes (oleanolic acid), flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, saponins.

- **Mechanisms**:
  - Potent anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive via PLA₂ and prostaglandin synthase inhibition.  
  - Strong antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity; broad antimicrobial spectrum; anticancer activity in vitro (breast, cervical, colon cell lines); antidiabetic via α‑amylase and α‑glucosidase inhibition.

## Pharmacokinetics (Preclinical Highlights)

- **VAC**:
  - No human PK data in the provided sources.  
  - Mouse study of agnuside: oral bioavailability ~0.7%, but broad tissue distribution including brain, suggesting local and CNS effects despite low plasma levels.

- **V. negundo**:
  - In silico ADME predicts good GI absorption and CNS penetration for several phytochemicals; some flavonoids flagged for PAINS.  
  - Rat PK interaction studies show co-administered V. negundo leaf extract significantly increases **paracetamol** Cmax (~+108%) and AUC (~+88%), implying inhibited metabolism/clearance (likely CYP-mediated).

- **V. doniana**:
  - No PK data; all effects derived from preclinical pharmacology.

## Human Clinical Evidence — Vitex agnus-castus

### Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) & PMDD

- **Evidence base**:
  - Multiple RCTs and systematic reviews/meta-analyses show VAC is more effective than placebo and comparable to some active comparators for PMS.  
  - Meta-analysis (3 placebo-controlled trials, n=520) → RR of symptom remission ≈2.57 vs placebo.  
  - Another review (17 RCTs, 14 in quantitative synthesis) found 13/14 studies favored VAC; large pooled effect size (Hedges g ≈ −1.21) but with high heterogeneity and probable publication bias.

- **Key trials**:
  - **Schellenberg (2001)**: 20 mg ZE 440 daily vs placebo (n=178; 3 cycles) → responder rate 52% vs 24%.  
  - **He et al. (2009)**: 40 mg BNO 1095 daily vs placebo (n=419; 3 cycles) → efficacy rate ~80% vs ~50%.  
  - **Zamani et al. (2012)**: ~40 drops/day vs placebo over 6 cycles → significant symptom reduction.  
  - **Lauritzen et al. (1997)**: VAC vs pyridoxine; global improvement ~77% vs ~61%.  
  - **Atmaca et al. (2003)**: VAC vs fluoxetine for PMDD; response ~58% vs ~68% (non-significant difference).

- **Clinical profile**:
  - Most effective for **physical PMS symptoms** (breast tenderness, bloating, headache) but also beneficial for mood and irritability.  
  - Onset typically after **2–3 cycles**, with maximal benefit after 3–6 months of continuous use.

### Cyclical Mastalgia

- **Kilicdag et al. (2004)**:
  - VAC 40 mg/day vs bromocriptine 2.5 mg BID (3 months) → both reduced serum prolactin and mastalgia; VAC comparable efficacy with far fewer adverse events (especially GI).

- **Other RCTs**:
  - VAC vs flurbiprofen: comparable reduction in breast pain intensity/duration.  
  - VAC vs placebo: significantly greater reductions in mastalgia scores within ~2 months.

### Menstrual Irregularities, Luteal Phase Defect & Hyperprolactinaemia

- **Menstrual irregularities**:
  - Observational data in >200 women: VAC improved irregular cycles in ~80% of cases; some pregnancies achieved in subfertile patients.

- **Luteal phase defect & latent hyperprolactinaemia (Milewicz 1993)**:
  - 20 mg/day VAC vs placebo (3 months) in women with shortened luteal phase and elevated prolactin after TRH stimulation:  
    - Significant ↓ prolactin response (p<0.001).  
    - Luteal phase length normalized by ~5 days.  
    - Mid-luteal progesterone increased significantly.  
    - Pregnancies occurred in the treatment group.

- **Mild hyperprolactinaemia (Kilicdag 2004)**:
  - VAC 40 mg/day vs bromocriptine: both reduce prolactin and mastalgia; VAC better tolerated.

## Human Clinical Evidence — Vitex negundo

- **Cough/respiratory**:
  - Clinical trials and regulatory dossiers (e.g., Philippines lagundi registration) support its use as a **non-opioid antitussive** for acute cough.  
  - Randomized studies show improvement in cough frequency and severity vs placebo in acute, non-bacterial cough over ~3 days.

- **Musculoskeletal pain (emerging)**:
  - Pilot studies of V. negundo ± ginger show fast analgesic effects in exercise-induced knee pain and chronic low back pain; evidence is early but promising.

## Safety & Adverse Effects

### Vitex agnus-castus

- **Common AEs**:
  - Generally well tolerated. Occasional mild GI upset, headache, or acne-like eruptions reported.  
  - Rare: allergic reactions; isolated case of phytobezoar with improperly processed seeds.

- **Contraindications**:
  - **Pregnancy and lactation**: Dopaminergic and prolactin-suppressive effects are undesirable in these states.  
  - **Pituitary disorders**: Especially prolactinomas; use only under endocrinologist supervision.  
  - Known hypersensitivity to VAC.

- **Theoretical interactions**:
  - With **dopaminergic/antidopaminergic medications** (antipsychotics, antiemetics).  
  - In vitro inhibition of **CYP2C19/CYP3A4** suggests potential PK interactions with substrates of these enzymes (e.g., clopidogrel, sertraline, simvastatin), though robust clinical data are lacking.

### Vitex negundo

- **Common AEs**:
  - Clinical use (e.g., lagundi) generally well tolerated; mild GI or allergic reactions possible.

- **Documented interactions**:
  - **Paracetamol (acetaminophen)**: Rat PK studies show significant increases in Cmax and AUC when co-administered, suggesting impaired metabolism/clearance and increased hepatotoxic risk.  
  - Regulatory advisories warn against unregistered V. negundo-containing supplements that have not been evaluated for safety/quality.

### Vitex doniana

- **Data**:
  - Sub-acute toxicity studies in animals suggest oral extracts are relatively safe, but **no human safety data** exist.  
  - Contact with sawdust can cause dermatitis; irrelevant to usual clinical use.

## Clinical Decision Rules (Summarized)

- **PMS (physical-symptom predominant)**:
  - **IF** a premenopausal woman has moderate–severe PMS with prominent physical symptoms,  
    **THEN** consider VAC 20–40 mg standardized extract daily for ≥3 cycles,  
    **BECAUSE** multiple RCTs show superior symptom reduction vs placebo and parity with some pharmacologic agents, with good tolerability.

- **Cyclical mastalgia**:
  - **IF** a patient has luteal-phase cyclical breast pain,  
    **THEN** recommend VAC 40 mg daily,  
    **BECAUSE** RCTs show equivalence to flurbiprofen and bromocriptine with fewer adverse effects.

- **Mild hyperprolactinaemia / luteal phase defect**:
  - **IF** a woman with mild hyperprolactinaemia or luteal phase defect cannot tolerate bromocriptine,  
    **THEN** trial VAC 20–40 mg daily for 3 months,  
    **BECAUSE** controlled trials show normalization of prolactin response, improved luteal progesterone and restoration of cycles.

- **Acute non-bacterial cough (V. negundo)**:
  - **IF** an adult or child presents with acute non-bacterial cough and wants a non-opioid antitussive,  
    **THEN** use a registered lagundi/V. negundo preparation per label for ~3 days,  
    **BECAUSE** clinical trials demonstrate reduced cough frequency and severity vs placebo.

## Red Flags & Triage

- **VAC**:
  - Pregnancy, lactation, and untreated pituitary tumors: avoid.  
  - Concomitant dopaminergic/antidopaminergic therapy: use cautiously and monitor.  
  - History of serious psychiatric disease: consider risk/benefit given dopaminergic actions.

- **V. negundo**:
  - Chronic or high-dose paracetamol use: avoid co-administration or monitor liver function closely.  
  - Avoid unregistered/uncertified products due to quality and safety concerns.

- **V. doniana**:
  - Restrict to research contexts until human clinical and safety data are available.

---

## Research Gaps & Future Directions

- **VAC**: Need for human PK studies; large, high-quality RCTs directly comparing VAC to SSRIs/OCPs for PMS/PMDD; exploration of roles in PCOS and metabolic disorders.  
- **V. negundo**: Well-designed RCTs in musculoskeletal pain, cardiometabolic disease and oncology support; systematic characterization of CYP-mediated drug interactions.  
- **V. doniana**: First-in-human trials to translate promising preclinical findings (hepatoprotective, anticancer, antidiabetic) into clinical evidence; standardization of active constituents (e.g., oleanolic acid, saponins).
