## Main Topic

Iodine is an essential trace element required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It plays a central role in regulating metabolic activity and supporting neurodevelopment during gestation and early life. This monograph summarizes iodine’s physiological roles, recommended intakes, dietary sources, population status, deficiency considerations and safety profile based on evidence from health-professional resources and the research they reference.

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Physiological role**: Required for production of thyroxine (T₄) and triiodothyronine (T₃), which regulate protein synthesis, enzymatic activity and basal metabolic rate; critical for fetal and infant brain and skeletal development.
- **Body stores**: An iodine-replete adult contains ~15–20 mg of iodine, with 70–80% in the thyroid gland.
- **Intake**:
  - Adult RDA: **150 mcg/day** (men and women).  
  - Pregnancy: **220 mcg/day** (WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD recommend ~250 mcg/day).  
  - Lactation: **290 mcg/day**.  
  - UL for adults: **1,100 mcg/day** (lower ULs for children).
- **Sources**: Seaweed (variable but often very high), fish and seafood (e.g., cod, oysters), dairy, eggs, iodized salt and some breads made with iodate dough conditioners; fruits and vegetables are usually poor sources.
- **Population status**: In the U.S., median intakes and urinary iodine concentrations suggest general sufficiency, but **many pregnant women have suboptimal iodine status**, making them a key risk group.
- **Deficiency**:
  - Causes goiter, hypothyroidism and, during pregnancy, severe neurodevelopmental impairment (cretinism), intellectual disability and growth retardation; even mild deficiency can reduce IQ.  
  - At-risk groups include pregnant and lactating women, vegans, individuals avoiding iodized salt, residents of low-iodine regions and those on restrictive diets.
- **Safety**:
  - Excess iodine (especially above the UL) can precipitate thyroid dysfunction (iodine-induced hyper- or hypothyroidism, thyroiditis) and may interact with thyroid-active drugs.  
  - Clinicians should balance preventing deficiency with avoiding excessive iodine intake, particularly from seaweed supplements and high-dose products.

| **Chemical forms**     | Iodine rarely exists as elemental iodine in foods; it is typically present as iodide (I⁻), iodate (IO₃⁻) or iodinated salts (e.g., potassium iodide, sodium iodide).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Physiological role** | Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroxine (T₄) and triiodothyronine (T₃). These thyroid hormones regulate protein synthesis, enzymatic activity and basal metabolic rate. Adequate iodine is also critical for proper fetal and infant skeletal and central nervous system development. TSH stimulates thyroid uptake of iodide; persistent iodine deficiency leads to elevated TSH and goiter. Emerging evidence suggests possible roles in immune function and breast tissue health. |
| **Body stores**        | An iodine‑replete adult contains ~15–20 mg of iodine, with 70–80% in the thyroid gland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: Dietary iodide and iodate are rapidly and almost completely absorbed in the stomach and duodenum.  
- **Distribution & storage**: The thyroid gland concentrates circulating iodide for hormone synthesis; excess iodine is distributed to other tissues or excreted.  
- **Excretion**: More than 90% of dietary iodine is excreted in urine, making urinary iodine concentration a useful marker of recent intake at the population level.

## Recommended Intakes

The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) established RDAs for iodine (and AIs for infants) to meet requirements for thyroid hormone production and prevent iodine deficiency disorders.

### Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Iodine

| Age & physiological state | RDA / AI (mcg/day)                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Birth–6 months**        | 110 mcg* (AI)                                                                       |
| **7–12 months**           | 130 mcg* (AI)                                                                       |
| **1–3 yr**                | 90 mcg                                                                              |
| **4–8 yr**                | 90 mcg                                                                              |
| **9–13 yr**               | 120 mcg                                                                             |
| **14–18 yr**              | 150 mcg (males/females); **220 mcg** during pregnancy; **290 mcg** during lactation |
| **≥ 19 yr**               | 150 mcg (males/females); **220 mcg** during pregnancy; **290 mcg** during lactation |

*AIs for infants are based on estimated iodine intake from breast milk. WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD suggest a slightly higher intake of 250 mcg/day for pregnant women.

### Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)

- **Adults**: 1,100 mcg/day.  
- **Children**: UL ranges from ~200 mcg/day (1–3 yr) up to 600 mcg/day (9–13 yr).  
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: 900 mcg/day is recommended as the UL.

Exceeding the UL increases the risk of thyroid dysfunction (hyper- or hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis).

## Dietary Sources

### Foods

- **Seaweed**: Kelp, nori, kombu and wakame are among the richest natural sources; iodine content varies widely (≈16–2,984 mcg/g).  
- **Fish and seafood**:
  - Cod (~146 mcg per 3 oz).  
  - Oysters (~93 mcg per 3 oz).  
  - Shrimp (~13 mcg per 3 oz).  
  - Tuna (~7 mcg per 3 oz).  
- **Dairy products**:
  - Milk (~84 mcg per cup).  
  - Yogurt (~87 mcg per ¾ cup).  
  - Levels vary with animal feed and use of iodophor sanitizers.  
- **Eggs**: A hard-boiled egg provides ~31 mcg.  
- **Iodized salt**:
  - ¼ teaspoon provides ~78 mcg (~52% of the Daily Value).  
  - U.S. iodized salt typically contains ~45–50 mcg iodine per gram.  
  - Most processed foods use non-iodized salt.  
- **Bread**:
  - Products made with iodate dough conditioners contain ~273–296 mcg per two slices.  
  - Only ~20% of U.S. breads use iodate; breads without iodate contain little iodine.  
- **Plant foods**:
  - Most fruits and vegetables are poor sources; iodine content depends on soil levels.

### Dietary Supplements

- Iodine is commonly included in multivitamin/mineral products at ~150 mcg per serving.  
- Some prenatal vitamins provide iodine (often 150 mcg), though not all do.  
- Seaweed-based supplements and standalone iodine products can contain high doses, sometimes exceeding the UL.  
- Iodide in supplements is highly bioavailable (~96% absorption).

### Iodized Salt Programs

- Salt iodization has dramatically reduced global iodine deficiency.  
- In the U.S., iodization is **voluntary**; much processed food uses non-iodized salt, so discretionary use of iodized table salt remains an important source.

## Iodine Intake and Population Status

- **United States**:
  - Total Diet Study (2008–2012) estimates mean iodine intake at ~216 mcg/day (range 141–296 mcg), meeting or exceeding the EAR for most groups.  
  - NHANES data show median urinary iodine concentrations have stabilized since 2000, indicating general sufficiency.  
  - However, pregnant women appear at risk of inadequate intake: NHANES 2001–2014 analyses report median urinary iodine concentrations of 125–181 mcg/L, below the WHO recommended 150–249 mcg/L for pregnancy.
- **Biomarkers**:
  - For populations, median urinary iodine concentrations of:  
    - 100–199 mcg/L (children/adults) indicate adequate intake.  
    - 150–249 mcg/L (pregnant women) indicate adequate intake.  
  - Spot urine samples are useful for assessing **population** status but not for **individual** diagnosis due to high day-to-day variability; multiple 24‑hour collections or repeated spot samples are needed for individual assessment.

## Groups at Risk of Inadequacy

Certain populations are more susceptible to iodine deficiency:

1. **Pregnant and lactating women**:
   - Higher iodine requirements (220–290 mcg/day) and increased renal clearance.  
   - NHANES suggests many U.S. pregnant women have suboptimal urinary iodine levels.  
2. **Infants exclusively fed non-iodized formula**:
   - Breast milk and most formulas contain iodine; some specialty formulas may be low.  
3. **People who avoid iodized salt or dairy/seafood**:
   - Users of non-iodized specialty salts (sea salt, kosher, Himalayan) and vegans may have lower intakes.  
4. **Residents of regions with iodine-deficient soils**:
   - Foods grown in low-iodine soils (parts of Europe, Africa, Asia) have low iodine content; iodized salt programs mitigate this risk.  
5. **Patients with restrictive diets**:
   - People on low-salt diets, or those avoiding processed foods and common iodine-rich foods, may require alternative sources or supplementation.

## Iodine Deficiency and Clinical Manifestations

- **Goiter**:
  - Persistent iodine deficiency leads to elevated TSH and thyroid enlargement as the gland attempts to trap more iodide.  
- **Hypothyroidism**:
  - Reduced thyroid hormone production results in fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation and other hypothyroid symptoms.  
- **Cretinism and neurodevelopmental impairment**:
  - Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy causes congenital hypothyroidism, intellectual disability, deaf-mutism and growth retardation in offspring.  
  - Even **mild-to-moderate deficiency** can lower IQ and impair cognitive development.  
- **Pregnancy outcomes**:
  - Iodine deficiency is linked to miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm delivery.

Diagnosing iodine deficiency in individuals is difficult due to day-to-day variability in urinary iodine. Multiple 24‑hour urine collections or repeated spot samples improve reliability.

## Iodine and Health

### Thyroid Disease Management

- Iodine is indispensable for thyroid hormone synthesis.  
- In iodine-deficient individuals, supplementation corrects hypothyroidism and reduces goiter size.  
- In iodine-replete individuals, excessive iodine can precipitate thyroid dysfunction, so supplementation must be tailored to baseline status.

### Extra-thyroidal Effects

- Limited evidence suggests iodine may support immune function and improve symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease, but the clinical data are not strong enough for routine recommendations.

---

## Safety and Toxicity

### Excess Iodine Intake

- **Acute exposure**:
  - High single doses can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.  
- **Chronic high intake (> UL)**:
  - Can lead to:  
    - Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (especially in individuals with nodular goiter or latent Graves’ disease).  
    - Iodine-induced hypothyroidism (Wolff–Chaikoff effect).  
    - Thyroiditis and goiter.  
  - Seaweed and high-dose supplements are common sources of excessive iodine.

### Interactions with Medications

- **Antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil)**:
  - Used to treat hyperthyroidism; concurrent high iodine intake can counteract their effects or exacerbate hypothyroidism.  
- **Amiodarone**:
  - Contains very high iodine content and can induce both hypo- and hyperthyroidism.  
- **Lithium**:
  - May inhibit iodine uptake by the thyroid and precipitate hypothyroidism.  
- **Radiographic contrast agents**:
  - Contain large amounts of iodine; can interfere with thyroid function tests and precipitate thyroid dysfunction in susceptible individuals.

Clinicians should monitor thyroid function when these drugs are prescribed and counsel patients about appropriate iodine intake.

---

## Special Considerations

- **Pregnancy and lactation**:
  - Adequate iodine is critical for fetal brain development.  
  - The American Thyroid Association recommends that all pregnant and lactating women in the U.S. and Canada take a prenatal supplement containing **150 mcg iodine**, in addition to dietary intake.  
  - Not all prenatal vitamins contain iodine, so label review is essential.
- **Vegans and individuals limiting salt**:
  - Encourage iodine-rich foods (e.g., appropriately used seaweed, fortified dairy alternatives) or supplements under medical guidance.  
  - Relying on specialty non-iodized salts alone is inadequate for iodine intake.
- **Seaweed supplements**:
  - Iodine content is highly variable and may exceed safe limits; patients should use reputable products and avoid excessive intake.

---

## Practical Recommendations for Clinicians

1. **Assess dietary intake and supplement use**:
   - Ask about iodized salt, seaweed, dairy, seafood and supplement use, particularly in pregnant and lactating women.  
2. **Counsel on RDAs and ULs**:
   - Help patients meet RDAs (150 mcg/day in adults; 220–290 mcg/day in pregnancy/lactation) and avoid exceeding ULs (1,100 mcg/day in adults; 900 mcg/day in pregnancy/lactation).  
3. **Encourage appropriate iodized salt use**:
   - For individuals without low-sodium indications, iodized salt can be a practical way to maintain adequate iodine intake.  
4. **Monitor high-risk patients**:
   - Check thyroid function in pregnant women, vegans, patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and those using iodine-rich medications or supplements.  
5. **Educate about supplement quality**:
   - Favor prenatal vitamins and multivitamins that include appropriate iodine doses; discourage unsupervised high-dose kelp or iodine drops.

## Conclusion

Iodine is an essential micronutrient required for thyroid hormone synthesis and neurodevelopment. In many countries, iodized salt, seafood and dairy provide adequate intake, but specific groups—especially pregnant and lactating women and those avoiding iodized salt or animal products—remain at risk of deficiency. Clinicians should evaluate dietary patterns, recommend appropriate supplementation when indicated and remain vigilant about both deficiency and excess, given the relatively narrow margin between RDA and UL. Maintaining balanced iodine intake supports thyroid health, healthy pregnancy outcomes and optimal cognitive development across the lifespan.
