## Main Topic

Chromium is a trace element that exists mainly in two valence states. The trivalent form (Cr³⁺) occurs naturally in foods and supplements, while the hexavalent form (Cr⁶⁺) is a toxic by‑product of industrial processes and is not used in supplements. Historically, chromium was thought to potentiate insulin’s action and influence carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism; more recent evaluations question whether it is truly essential, so current recommendations use Adequate Intakes (AIs) rather than a Recommended Dietary Allowance.

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Form and biology**: Nutritionally relevant chromium is **trivalent chromium (Cr³⁺)**; **hexavalent chromium (Cr⁶⁺)** is toxic and industrial. Chromium is bound mainly to transferrin in blood, and no validated test exists for chromium status in healthy individuals.
- **Intake**: Intake guidance is based on **Adequate Intakes (AIs)** derived from observed usual intakes, not on deficiency syndromes. Typical adult AIs are ~25–35 µg/day, with slightly higher values in pregnancy and lactation. The FDA Daily Value (DV) is **35 µg** for adults and children ≥4 years.
- **Sources**: Wide range of foods (meats, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, brewer’s yeast, spices, beer, wine); content varies substantially depending on soil, processing and stainless‑steel contact. Dairy and sugar-rich foods are generally low in chromium. Supplements often provide 35–1,000 µg in forms like chromium picolinate, nicotinate, chloride, polynicotinate and histidinate.
- **Clinical evidence**:
  - **Type 2 diabetes / impaired glucose tolerance**: Some RCTs (e.g., chromium picolinate 1,000 µg/day) report modest improvements in fasting/post‑prandial glucose, insulin and HbA1c, but overall evidence from trials and meta‑analyses is inconsistent and effects are small.
  - **Metabolic syndrome and related conditions**: Observational data show inverse associations between toenail chromium and metabolic syndrome, but RCTs (e.g., 500 µg chromium picolinate twice daily for 16 weeks) have not demonstrated clear benefit.
  - Evidence for **PCOS, dyslipidemia, weight and lean body mass** is limited and inconsistent.
- **Guideline position**: The American Diabetes Association does **not** recommend routine chromium supplementation for diabetes management; FDA allows only a **qualified** health claim noting that evidence for chromium picolinate and reduced insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes risk is highly uncertain.
- **Safety**: Typical dietary/supplemental intakes of trivalent chromium appear safe in healthy individuals; no UL has been established. Rare case reports associate high‑dose chromium picolinate with GI upset and possible kidney or liver dysfunction, but causality is unclear. Hexavalent chromium is toxic and carcinogenic but not present in supplements.

## Adequate Intake (AI)

The Food and Nutrition Board set AIs for chromium based on observed intake in healthy populations because of insufficient data to establish an EAR or RDA. Use these values as guidance for daily chromium intake:

| Life stage (ages) | AI for males | AI for females | AI during pregnancy | AI during lactation |
| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Birth–6 mo*       | 0.2 µg/day   | 0.2 µg/day     | –                   | –                   |
| 7–12 mo*          | 5.5 µg/day   | 5.5 µg/day     | –                   | –                   |
| 1–3 yr            | 11 µg/day    | 11 µg/day      | –                   | –                   |
| 4–8 yr            | 15 µg/day    | 15 µg/day      | –                   | –                   |
| 9–13 yr           | 25 µg/day    | 21 µg/day      | –                   | –                   |
| 14–18 yr          | 35 µg/day    | 24 µg/day      | 29 µg/day           | 44 µg/day           |
| 19–50 yr          | 35 µg/day    | 25 µg/day      | 30 µg/day           | 45 µg/day           |
| ≥ 51 yr           | 30 µg/day    | 20 µg/day      | –                   | –                   |

*AIs for infants are based on chromium content of human milk and complementary foods.

**Daily Value (DV)**: The U.S. FDA Daily Value for chromium is **35 µg** for adults and children ≥4 years. Chromium is not required on food labels unless it is added to the product.

## Sources of Chromium

- **Dietary sources**:
  - Found in a wide variety of foods: meats, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, brewer’s yeast, spices, beer and wine.  
  - Concentrations vary widely due to soil composition, agricultural practices and contamination from stainless‑steel equipment.  
  - Dairy products and foods high in sugar tend to be low in chromium.
- **Food content variability**:
  - Chromium content in specific foods can vary dramatically; for example, different oatmeal samples have shown up to a 50‑fold variation, illustrating measurement challenges.
- **Breast milk**:
  - Human milk contains roughly **0.25 µg/L** of chromium, with reported concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 10.8 µg/L.
- **Supplements**:
  - Multivitamin/mineral products typically contain **35–120 µg** of chromium.  
  - Single‑ingredient chromium supplements provide **200–500 µg**, and some products supply up to **1,000 µg**.  
  - Common forms: chromium picolinate, chromium nicotinate, chromium chloride, chromium polynicotinate and chromium histidinate.  
  - Absorption differences among forms are modest; about **0.4–2.5%** of dietary chromium is absorbed.  
  - Labels list **elemental chromium** content, not total weight of the compound.

## Chromium Intakes and Status

- **Usual intake**:
  - U.S. data are limited; small studies report mean intakes around **29 µg/day** in women and **54 µg/day** in men.  
  - Planned diets show an average intake of about **27 µg per 2,000 kcal**.  
  - A survey in Northern Italy reported a median intake of ~**57 µg/day**.
- **Supplemental intake**:
  - NHANES III estimated median supplemental chromium intake around **23 µg/day** among users of chromium‑containing supplements.
- **Status assessment**:
  - Chromium in blood is mostly bound to transferrin.  
  - **Urinary chromium** reflects recent intake but not total body stores.  
  - There is **no validated biomarker** of chromium status for routine clinical use in healthy individuals.

---

## Deficiency

- **Deficiency status**:
  - No definitive chromium deficiency syndrome has been identified in otherwise healthy individuals.  
  - Early case reports of patients on long‑term total parenteral nutrition described hyperglycemia, weight loss and neuropathy that improved with pharmacologic chromium, but subsequent evaluation suggests these cases do not conclusively prove a unique deficiency state.
- **Parenteral nutrition**:
  - Chromium is now routinely added to parenteral nutrition solutions (about **10–15 µg/day**), and research continues to determine whether lower amounts are adequate.

---

## Pharmacology / Mechanisms

- Chromium may **potentiate insulin action** by forming a complex (often termed chromodulin) that binds to insulin receptors and enhances their activity.  
- Absorption is generally **low (about 0.4–2.5%)**.  
- **Ascorbic acid** and **prostaglandin inhibitors** such as aspirin can increase chromium absorption, whereas **oxalate** and **antacids** may reduce it.

## Therapeutic Uses and Evidence

### Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Type 2 Diabetes

- **Rationale**:
  - Because chromium may enhance insulin action, numerous RCTs have tested whether supplementation improves glycaemic control.
- **Trial data**:
  - A 1997 study in adults with type 2 diabetes reported that **1,000 µg/day of chromium picolinate** (in two divided doses) lowered fasting serum glucose, post‑prandial glucose, insulin concentrations and HbA1c compared with placebo.  
  - Subsequent trials and meta‑analyses have produced **mixed findings**, with modest or no clinically meaningful improvements in fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Evidence is **insufficient to recommend chromium supplementation** for diabetes management.  
  - The **American Diabetes Association** does not recommend routine chromium use for glycaemic control.  
  - The **FDA** allows only a **qualified health claim**, stating that evidence linking chromium picolinate to reduced insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes risk is highly uncertain.

### Metabolic Syndrome

- **Hypothesized benefits**:
  - Because insulin resistance is central to metabolic syndrome, chromium has been investigated as a potential adjunct therapy.
- **Observational data**:
  - Baseline toenail chromium levels were inversely associated with incidence of metabolic syndrome over 23 years in one cohort.
- **Clinical trials**:
  - RCTs are few; one trial using **500 µg chromium picolinate twice daily for 16 weeks** in adults with metabolic syndrome showed **no improvement** in metabolic parameters.  
  - Overall, current evidence does **not support chromium supplementation** for metabolic syndrome.

### Other Conditions (PCOS, Dyslipidemia, Weight and Lean Body Mass)

- Trials investigating chromium for PCOS, dyslipidemia, weight loss and lean body mass report **limited and inconsistent** effects.  
- Some studies note minor improvements in lipid profiles or body composition, but heterogeneity in study design and dosing prevents firm conclusions.  
- Chromium is **not widely recommended** for these indications.

---

## Safety and Toxicity

- **Upper intake level**:
  - The FNB has **not established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)** for chromium due to insufficient data.
- **Adverse effects**:
  - Typical dietary and supplemental intakes of trivalent chromium appear safe for healthy individuals.  
  - High‑dose chromium picolinate has occasionally been associated with GI upset, headaches and, in case reports, kidney or liver dysfunction, but causality remains uncertain.  
  - **Hexavalent chromium (Cr⁶⁺)** is a known toxin and carcinogen but is not used in supplements and is distinct from nutritional chromium.

## Interactions and Counseling Considerations

- **Absorption modifiers**:
  - **Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)** and prostaglandin inhibitors (e.g., aspirin) can increase chromium absorption.  
  - **Oxalates** and **antacids** may reduce absorption.
- **Potential drug interactions**:
  - Clinicians should consider possible interactions with **insulin** or **oral hypoglycemic agents**, although evidence for clinically significant interactions is limited.
- **Dietary advice**:
  - Encourage patients to obtain chromium from a varied diet (whole grains, lean meats, fruits, vegetables) rather than supplements.
- **Supplement counseling**:
  - For patients seeking chromium for glycaemic control or weight loss, explain that evidence of benefit is inconsistent and generally modest at best.  
  - If patients choose to use supplements, prefer formulations closer to the **DV (35 µg)** and avoid high-dose products (e.g., ≥1,000 µg) unless under supervision.
- **Special populations**:
  - Pregnant and lactating individuals have slightly higher AIs (around **30 µg** and **45 µg** respectively) and no data suggest harm at these intake levels.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Routine chromium status testing is **not recommended**, given the lack of validated biomarkers in healthy individuals.  
  - In long‑term parenteral nutrition, standard trace‑element formulations providing ~10–15 µg/day are typically used; research may refine these requirements.
