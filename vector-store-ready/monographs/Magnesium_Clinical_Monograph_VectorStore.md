## Main Topic

Magnesium is an abundant mineral that serves as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymatic reactions, supporting protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control and blood pressure regulation. Roughly 25 g of magnesium are present in an adult body, with 50–60% stored in bone and the remainder in soft tissues and fluids. Serum magnesium concentrations normally range from 0.75 to 0.95 mmol/L; levels below 0.75 mmol/L indicate hypomagnesaemia.

---

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Core roles**: Essential mineral; cofactor for ATP-dependent enzymes involved in protein synthesis, energy production, nucleic acid stability, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, bone metabolism and cardiovascular function.
- **Intake**: Adult RDAs range from ~310–420 mg/day (higher in pregnancy and lactation depending on age); UL for supplemental magnesium is **350 mg/day** for adults and adolescents (ULs do **not** apply to food sources).
- **Key sources**: Nuts/seeds (pumpkin, chia, almonds, cashews), green leafy vegetables (spinach), legumes and whole grains, fortified cereals/soymilk, some dairy and fish, and magnesium-containing drinking water.
- **Who is at risk of deficiency**: People with chronic GI disease or diarrhea, type 2 diabetes, alcohol dependence, older adults, and patients on certain medications (PPIs, loop/thiazide diuretics) or with poor diet.
- **Clinical uses (best supported)**:
  - Correcting deficiency and suboptimal intake.
  - Possible benefit for blood pressure and stroke risk in higher dietary intake ranges (observational).
  - Adjunctive role in glycaemic control in deficient individuals with type 2 diabetes (mixed trial data).
  - Potential benefit in bone health and osteoporosis (limited trial evidence).
  - Migraine prophylaxis at 300–600 mg/day elemental magnesium, considered “probably effective” by neurology guidelines when supervised.
- **Safety**: Excess dietary magnesium is generally safe; high-dose supplements or magnesium-containing laxatives/antacids can cause diarrhea and, in renal impairment, hypermagnesaemia. Avoid high-dose magnesium in significant kidney disease.
- **Key interactions**: Reduced absorption of oral bisphosphonates, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones; altered magnesium balance with loop/thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretics; hypomagnesaemia with long-term PPI use.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Chemical forms**     | Magnesium is provided as elemental magnesium in supplements and medications. Common forms include magnesium oxide, citrate, chloride, lactate and aspartate.            |
| **Physiological role** | Essential mineral; cofactor for ATP‑dependent enzymes involved in protein synthesis, energy production, nucleic acid stability, muscle contraction and nerve conduction. |
| **Body stores**        | ~25 g in adults, 50–60% in bones and teeth; remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluid.                                                                           |

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: Typically 30–40% of dietary magnesium is absorbed in the gut. Soluble forms in supplements (citrate, lactate, chloride, aspartate) are more bioavailable than poorly soluble forms (oxide, sulfate).  
- **Distribution**: Magnesium distributes throughout intracellular and extracellular compartments; ~1% is in blood.  
- **Excretion**: Kidneys regulate magnesium excretion (~120 mg/day) to maintain serum levels; renal impairment reduces the ability to excrete excess magnesium.

### Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Supplemental Magnesium

| Age           | UL (mg/day from supplements/medications) |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **1–3 yr**    | 65 mg                                    |

## Sources of Magnesium

### Dietary Sources

Magnesium is widespread in plant and animal foods. Good sources include:

- **Seeds and nuts**: Pumpkin seeds (156 mg/oz; 37% DV), chia seeds (111 mg/oz; 26% DV), almonds (80 mg/oz; 19% DV), cashews (74 mg/oz; 18% DV).  
- **Green leafy vegetables**: Spinach (78 mg per ½ cup cooked; 19% DV).  
- **Legumes & grains**: Black beans (60 mg per ½ cup; 14% DV), edamame (50 mg per ½ cup; 12% DV), whole‑wheat bread (23 mg/slice).  
- **Fortified cereals & soymilk**: Many breakfast cereals are fortified with ~10% DV per serving; soymilk provides ~61 mg per cup.  
- **Other foods**: Bananas (32 mg), baked potato with skin (43 mg), yogurt (42 mg/8 oz), salmon (26 mg), avocados (22 mg/½ cup).  
- **Water**: Magnesium content in tap, mineral and bottled waters varies from 1 mg/L to >120 mg/L.

### Dietary Supplements

- Available as magnesium oxide, citrate, chloride and other salts. The Supplement Facts label lists elemental magnesium content.  
- Soluble forms (aspartate, citrate, lactate, chloride) are better absorbed than oxide or sulfate.  
- High-dose zinc supplements (~142 mg/day) can interfere with magnesium absorption.

### Medications

- Magnesium is an ingredient in antacids and laxatives (e.g., milk of magnesia). These products can deliver high doses of magnesium and should be used cautiously.

## Magnesium Intake and Status

Assessing magnesium status is challenging because most magnesium resides within cells or bone. Serum magnesium is the most common biomarker but poorly reflects total body stores. Other methods include measuring magnesium in red cells, saliva or urine, or conducting a magnesium‑loading test; none are ideal.

NHANES does not routinely measure serum magnesium. Average dietary intakes in the U.S. often fall below RDAs; older adults, people with chronic diseases and certain lifestyle factors may have lower intakes.

---

## Magnesium Deficiency

Symptomatic deficiency from low dietary intake is rare in otherwise healthy individuals because kidneys conserve magnesium. However, chronically low intake or excessive losses can cause deficiency.

### Clinical Manifestations

Early symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and weakness. Progression leads to numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms and coronary spasms. Severe deficiency may trigger hypocalcaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Groups at Increased Risk

- **Gastrointestinal diseases**: Chronic diarrhea and malabsorption from Crohn’s disease, celiac disease or small‑intestine resection increase magnesium losses.  
- **Type 2 diabetes**: Insulin resistance and hyperglycemia cause greater urinary magnesium excretion; hypomagnesaemia may worsen insulin resistance.  
- **Alcohol dependence**: Poor dietary intake plus vomiting, diarrhea, pancreatic disease and renal losses contribute to magnesium deficiency.  
- **Older adults**: Lower dietary intakes, decreased intestinal absorption and higher urinary losses with age raise the risk of inadequacy.

## Health Effects and Clinical Evidence

### Cardiovascular Health

- Observational studies show inverse associations between magnesium status and cardiovascular disease. Higher serum magnesium levels and dietary intakes (~250 mg/day and above) correlate with lower risk of ischemic heart disease.  
- A meta‑analysis of seven prospective trials (≈241 000 participants) found that each 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium was associated with an 8% reduction in total stroke risk, particularly ischemic stroke.  
- However, the possibility of confounding by other nutrients exists; large randomized trials are needed to clarify magnesium’s role in cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Type 2 Diabetes

- Meta‑analyses of prospective cohort studies show that higher magnesium intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes; one analysis reported a 15% risk reduction per 100 mg/day increment, and another found a 23% lower risk when comparing highest to lowest intake categories.  
- Small clinical trials demonstrate mixed effects on glycaemic control. In one trial, supplementation with magnesium chloride (300 mg/day elemental) for 16 weeks improved fasting glucose and HbA1c, while another trial of magnesium aspartate (369 mg/day) had no effect.  
- The American Diabetes Association states there is insufficient evidence to recommend magnesium supplementation for glycaemic control in people without deficiency.

### Bone Health / Osteoporosis

- Magnesium influences bone formation through its effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts and on parathyroid hormone and vitamin D metabolism.  
- Population studies show positive associations between dietary magnesium and bone mineral density in men and women; women with osteoporosis often have lower serum magnesium than those without.  
- Small trials suggest magnesium supplementation may suppress bone turnover and potentially increase bone density in postmenopausal women (e.g., 290 mg/day magnesium citrate for 30 days decreased bone turnover markers), but more research is needed.

### Migraine

- Magnesium deficiency may contribute to migraine pathogenesis via effects on neurotransmitter release and vasoconstriction.  
- Several small, short-term randomized trials found that up to 600 mg/day of magnesium reduced migraine frequency. A review recommended 300 mg twice daily, alone or with medication, for prophylaxis.  
- The American Academy of Neurology/American Headache Society concluded that magnesium therapy is “probably effective” for migraine prevention. Because doses exceed the UL, treatment should be supervised.

## Safety and Toxicity

- **Food sources**: Excess magnesium from food is not harmful; kidneys excrete surplus amounts.  
- **Supplemental magnesium**: High doses from supplements or medications often cause diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramps. The forms most often associated with diarrhea include magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate and oxide.  
- **Renal impairment**: Individuals with kidney disease risk hypermagnesaemia because they cannot excrete excess magnesium. They should avoid high-dose supplements or magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids.  
- **ULs**: As noted above, the UL for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg/day for adults and adolescents; lower values apply to children.

---

## Interactions with Medications

- **Bisphosphonates**: Magnesium decreases absorption of oral bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate); separate doses by ≥ 2 hours.  
- **Antibiotics**: Forms insoluble complexes with tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, ciprofloxacin). Take antibiotics at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after magnesium supplements.  
- **Diuretics**: Loop and thiazide diuretics increase urinary magnesium loss, whereas potassium‑sparing diuretics reduce excretion; monitor serum magnesium.  
- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Long‑term PPI use can cause hypomagnesaemia. FDA recommends checking serum magnesium before initiating long-term therapy and periodically thereafter. In some cases, discontinuation of the PPI may be necessary.

## Practical Guidelines for Clinicians

1. **Assess magnesium intake**: Ask about dietary patterns (green leafy vegetables, nuts, whole grains), use of fortified foods, drinking water sources, supplement use and medications that may contain magnesium.  
2. **Recognize at‑risk populations**: Monitor patients with gastrointestinal disorders, type 2 diabetes, alcohol dependence and older adults for magnesium inadequacy.  
3. **Recommend food first**: Encourage consumption of magnesium-rich foods as part of a balanced diet. Fortified cereals, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains are key sources.  
4. **Use supplements judiciously**: Reserve magnesium supplementation for patients with documented deficiency or specific clinical indications (e.g., migraine prophylaxis under supervision). Advise on bioavailable forms (citrate, lactate, chloride) and avoid exceeding the UL.  
5. **Monitor interactions**: Review concurrent medications and advise patients on appropriate timing of magnesium supplements relative to bisphosphonates and certain antibiotics; monitor patients on diuretics or PPIs for magnesium status.  
6. **Screen renal function**: In patients with kidney disease, avoid magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids. Check serum magnesium levels when prescribing high‑dose supplements.

## Conclusion

Magnesium is a vital mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes. While deficiencies are uncommon in healthy individuals, suboptimal intakes are prevalent, particularly among older adults, people with gastrointestinal disorders, type 2 diabetes or alcohol dependence. Dietary magnesium is widely available in seeds, nuts, legumes, whole grains and green vegetables. Higher magnesium intakes are associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and may benefit bone health and migraine prevention, though definitive randomized trials are limited. Excessive magnesium from supplements can cause gastrointestinal upset and, in patients with renal impairment, hypermagnesaemia. Clinicians should prioritize food sources, assess risk factors and consider targeted supplementation when evidence supports a clear benefit.
