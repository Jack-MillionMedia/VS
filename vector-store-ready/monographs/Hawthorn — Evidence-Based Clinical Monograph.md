## 1. Clinician TL;DR — Hawthorn Clinical Summary

### 1.1. Core Clinical Takeaways — Hawthorn for Cardiovascular Health

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) is a well-studied herbal remedy with a long history of use for cardiovascular conditions. The clinical evidence base for Hawthorn is complex and contains significant contradictions, particularly regarding Hawthorn's role in modern chronic heart failure (CHF) management.

**Primary Indication for Hawthorn:**
The strongest evidence historically supports the use of standardized Hawthorn extracts (primarily WS 1442 and LI 132) as an adjunctive therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class II). Meta-analyses of older RCTs demonstrated modest but statistically significant improvements in exercise capacity, functional status, and symptom control with Hawthorn. However, this conclusion about Hawthorn is now highly contested by two large, recent, high-quality trials.

**Conflicting Evidence in Modern CHF — Hawthorn Efficacy Questioned:**
A pivotal 6-month trial (HERB CHF) found that adding Crataegus extract WS 1442 (900 mg/day) to contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy (including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics) provided no additional symptomatic or functional benefit compared to placebo. Similarly, the massive 2-year SPICE trial found no effect on the primary endpoint of cardiac events when WS 1442 was added to standard therapy in over 2,600 patients. A retrospective analysis of the HERB CHF data even suggested a possible increased risk of early heart failure progression in the Hawthorn treatment group. Therefore, current evidence suggests Hawthorn should not be used as an add-on therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe CHF who are receiving optimal medical care.

**Potential Antiarrhythmic Effect of Hawthorn:**
Despite failing to improve overall outcomes in the SPICE trial, a subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction in sudden cardiac death among patients with less impaired left ventricular function (LVEF ≥25%) taking Hawthorn. This suggests a potential antiarrhythmic benefit of Hawthorn that warrants further investigation but is not yet strong enough to form a basis for clinical recommendation.

**Other Indications for Hawthorn:**
Evidence for other indications of Hawthorn is weaker.
*   **Hawthorn for Hypertension:** Meta-analyses suggest a modest antihypertensive effect of Hawthorn, with one review showing a mean systolic blood pressure reduction of -6.65 mmHg. Hawthorn may be considered as a complementary therapy but is unlikely to replace first-line pharmaceutical agents.
*   **Hawthorn for Hyperlipidemia:** Preclinical and mechanistic data strongly support a lipid-lowering effect of Hawthorn, particularly for European species (WS 1442) which upregulate LDL receptors and inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Clinical data for the Chinese species (*C. pinnatifida*, Shanzha) is promising but suffers from methodological limitations.
*   **Hawthorn for Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes:** Abundant preclinical data shows hypoglycemic and cardioprotective effects of Hawthorn in animal models, but human clinical trials have been largely negative, finding no significant effect on blood glucose despite benefits on blood pressure.

### 1.2. Key Safety Considerations — Hawthorn Safety Profile

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

**Safety Profile of Hawthorn:**
Standardized Hawthorn extracts (WS 1442, LI 132) are generally well-tolerated with a low incidence of mild, transient adverse events, including dizziness, gastrointestinal complaints, and palpitations. No clinically significant herb-drug interactions have been identified in clinical studies, and co-administration of Hawthorn with digoxin appears safe. However, pharmacovigilance reports indicate rare serious events with Hawthorn, including cardiac arrhythmias and skin reactions.

**Critical Safety Warning — Hawthorn Tejocote Root Adulteration:**
A severe public health risk exists due to the adulteration of supplements labeled as "tejocote root" (*Crataegus mexicana*) with yellow oleander (*Cascabela thevetia*), a plant containing a lethal cardenolide toxin. Patients using these products have experienced severe bradycardia, heart block, and other life-threatening cardiac events. The U.S. FDA has issued warnings against these products. Clinicians must counsel patients to avoid unregulated sources and to be wary of products marketed for weight loss under the name tejocote.

### 1.3. Bottom Line for Practice — Clinical Use of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

**Conclusion for Practice:**
For clinicians, the central takeaway about Hawthorn is caution. Hawthorn's established role in uncomplicated, mild CHF is now questionable in the era of advanced pharmacotherapy. The use of Hawthorn should be discouraged in patients on standard HFrEF medication regimens. While Hawthorn may be considered as a complementary agent for mild hypertension or dyslipidemia, the modest effects of Hawthorn must be clearly communicated. Most importantly, patients must be warned against the dangers of contaminated Hawthorn products, particularly those sold online for weight loss.

## 3. Traditional Use — Hawthorn Historical Applications

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The medicinal use of Hawthorn spans millennia and diverse cultures, primarily centered on Hawthorn's purported benefits for the cardiovascular system. The genus *Crataegus*, comprising over 1000 species, has a rich ethnopharmacological history that continues to inform modern research on Hawthorn. The core therapeutic principle of Hawthorn has consistently revolved around Hawthorn's cardiotonic and circulatory-supporting properties.

### 3.1. European Traditional Use of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

In Europe, the use of Hawthorn dates back to antiquity, with Dioscorides documenting Hawthorn's application around 40-90 CE. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 19th century, various parts of the Hawthorn plant—berries, leaves, and flowers—were employed in folk medicine to treat a range of ailments, with a particular focus on heart complaints, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, chest pain (angina), and hardening of the arteries. By the early 1800s, American doctors were also incorporating Hawthorn into their practice for circulatory and respiratory disorders. Historical records from Ireland and England document Hawthorn's use for "blood fluxes," menstrual regulation, and general cardiovascular support. The physician John Gerard's 1633 Herbal noted Hawthorn's use for heart issues, and by the late 19th century, Dr. Jennings published the first formal article on Hawthorn as a heart remedy, leading to Hawthorn's wider recognition as a cardiovascular agent.

### 3.2. Chinese Traditional Use of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

In China, Hawthorn has a distinct traditional medicinal tradition. The dried fruit of *Crataegus pinnatifida* Bge. and its variety *major* N.E. Br. are recognized in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and have been used medicinally since at least 659 AD, as recorded in the *Tang Materia Medica*. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Hawthorn fruit is classified as a "food drug" (*shi liang yao*) prescribed for indigestion, epigastric distension, diarrhea, and hypertension. Hawthorn is believed to tonify the spleen, promote digestion, activate blood circulation, dissipate blood stasis, and resolve phlegm. The *Compendium of Materia Medica* (*Bencao Gangmu*) documents Hawthorn's use for thoracalgia (chest pain), hernia, blood stagnation, and hematochezia (rectal bleeding).

### 3.3. Mexican and Other Traditional Uses of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

In Mexico, the species *Crataegus mexicana* (known as tejocote) is used traditionally, though Hawthorn's use is fraught with modern safety concerns. Historically, Hawthorn has been used in folk medicine for various purposes, though Hawthorn's specific traditional applications are less documented than in Europe or China.

Beyond cardiovascular and digestive uses, Hawthorn has been traditionally applied for kidney and bladder issues, topical treatments for sores and frostbite, and as a remedy for anxiety. Some traditional uses of Hawthorn, however, lack modern clinical validation, such as Hawthorn's application for arterial plaque buildup or Hawthorn's promotion for weight loss, for which there is no supporting evidence. The concept of 'tradition' itself is complex; while regulatory bodies like the EU require 30 years of continuous commercial use within the region, scholarly analysis argues that a more rigorous evaluation of historical sources, transmission, and cultural ubiquity is necessary to fully leverage this body of knowledge about Hawthorn.

## 4. Preclinical Data — Hawthorn Mechanisms and Pharmacology

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Preclinical research provides a robust foundation for understanding the multifaceted pharmacological activities of Hawthorn, elucidating the mechanisms behind Hawthorn's traditional cardiovascular uses. The therapeutic potential of Hawthorn is attributed to a complex mixture of bioactive polyphenolic compounds, primarily flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidins (OPCs), along with triterpenic acids, phenolic acids, and cardiotonic amines. These compounds in Hawthorn act through numerous pathways to exert cardioprotective, vasodilatory, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects.

### 4.1. Cardiovascular Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The most extensively studied action of Hawthorn is Hawthorn's influence on myocardial contractility and vascular tone. Hawthorn extracts exhibit a positive inotropic effect, meaning Hawthorn increases the force of heart muscle contraction, without increasing oxygen consumption. This effect of Hawthorn is mediated via a cAMP-independent mechanism, likely involving the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase, which enhances intracellular calcium availability for contraction. Unlike conventional inotropes such as digitalis glycosides, Hawthorn does not shorten the cardiac refractory period, potentially reducing Hawthorn's arrhythmogenic risk. Furthermore, Hawthorn demonstrates potent vasorelaxant properties. Hawthorn induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation primarily through the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to increased production of nitric oxide (NO), a key signaling molecule that relaxes vascular smooth muscle. This NO-mediated pathway is a primary mechanism for Hawthorn's hypotensive and coronary vasodilatory effects. Hawthorn also possesses antiarrhythmic potential, evidenced by Hawthorn's ability to prolong the action potential duration and refractory period in cardiac myocytes, which helps stabilize heart rhythm.

### 4.2. Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Actions of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hawthorn is rich in antioxidants, including OPCs, flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, hyperoside), and chlorogenic acid, which scavenge free radicals and protect cells from oxidative damage. In vitro studies show that Hawthorn extracts enhance the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Beyond direct antioxidant effects, Hawthorn exhibits significant anti-inflammatory activity. Hawthorn inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, suppresses NF-κB signaling pathways, and reduces neutrophil function and elastase activity. This anti-inflammatory action of Hawthorn contributes to Hawthorn's protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic plaque formation.

### 4.3. Lipid Modulation and Antithrombotic Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Preclinical studies strongly support Hawthorn's role in managing dyslipidemia. The mechanism of Hawthorn involves multiple pathways: upregulation of hepatic LDL receptor expression, downregulation of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) synthesis, and inhibition of intestinal acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), an enzyme crucial for cholesterol absorption and lipoprotein assembly. These actions of Hawthorn collectively promote the clearance of LDL ("bad") cholesterol from the bloodstream. Tricyclic triterpenic acids present in Hawthorn, such as oleanolic and ursolic acid, are particularly implicated in ACAT inhibition. Additionally, Hawthorn extracts demonstrate antithrombotic activity by inhibiting platelet aggregation, a key step in thrombus formation. This effect of Hawthorn is mediated by sesquiterpenes and flavonoids that interfere with platelet activation pathways.

### 4.4. Renoprotective, Hepatoprotective, and Neuroprotective Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Emerging research highlights broader systemic benefits of Hawthorn. In diabetic animal models, Hawthorn extracts protect against renal and hepatic damage by improving histopathology, reducing oxidative stress markers, and modulating inflammatory pathways. Hawthorn also exhibits neuroprotective effects, improving cognitive deficits in diabetic rats and protecting neurons from damage in traumatic brain injury models, partly through strong acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, novel preclinical findings suggest that WS 1442 can stimulate cardiomyogenesis and angiogenesis from stem cells, opening a new frontier for research into regenerative therapies for heart disease using Hawthorn.

---

## 5. Human Clinical Evidence — Hawthorn Clinical Studies

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The body of human clinical evidence for Hawthorn is extensive but characterized by significant heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and outcomes, leading to nuanced and sometimes conflicting conclusions about Hawthorn. The vast majority of robust clinical data pertains to standardized extracts of European origin, specifically WS 1442 and LI 132, used for cardiovascular indications. Evidence for other uses of Hawthorn is more limited and often derived from studies with methodological weaknesses.

### 5.1. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) — Primary Indication for Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

This is the most studied indication for Hawthorn. A Cochrane review analyzing 14 double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs involving 1,110 patients concluded that standardized Hawthorn extracts provided significant symptomatic and physiologic benefits in patients with NYHA class I-III CHF. Meta-analyses of these trials showed statistically significant improvements in maximal workload (+5.35 Watts), exercise tolerance (+122.76 Watt×min), and a reduction in the pressure-heart rate product (-19.22 mmHg/min), indicating enhanced cardiac efficiency with Hawthorn. Symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea also improved significantly with Hawthorn. However, this positive narrative about Hawthorn has been fundamentally challenged by two large, definitive trials conducted in the modern era of evidence-based medicine.

**HERB CHF Trial — Hawthorn Efficacy in Modern CHF:**
The HERB CHF trial, a 6-month study of 120 patients with NYHA II-III CHF on optimal background therapy, found no significant difference between WS 1442 (900 mg/day) and placebo on its primary outcome, the change in 6-minute walk distance (P = 0.61) or any secondary outcomes related to symptoms or functional capacity.

**SPICE Trial — Hawthorn Long-Term Outcomes:**
Similarly, the SPICE trial, a 2-year study of 2,681 patients with NYHA II-III CHF and LVEF ≤35% on standard therapy, found no effect of WS 1442 (900 mg/day) on the primary composite endpoint of cardiac death, non-fatal MI, or hospitalization. Intriguingly, a subgroup analysis of the SPICE trial suggested a potential antiarrhythmic benefit of Hawthorn, showing a significant reduction in sudden cardiac death in patients with better-preserved LV function (LVEF ≥25%). This conflicting evidence suggests that while Hawthorn may offer benefits in historical contexts or milder cases, Hawthorn's utility as an adjunctive therapy in patients managed with contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy is unproven and likely negligible.

### 5.2. Hypertension — Hawthorn for Blood Pressure

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The evidence for Hawthorn's antihypertensive effects is modest but consistent. A meta-analysis of six RCTs involving 428 participants found that Hawthorn supplementation led to a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference: -6.65 mmHg). Another study in patients with type 2 diabetes taking prescription drugs found that 1200 mg/day of LI 132 significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure over 16 weeks compared to placebo. However, the effect size of Hawthorn is smaller than that of first-line antihypertensives, and a crossover trial found no dose-response effect of Hawthorn on flow-mediated dilation, suggesting the mechanism of Hawthorn may not be solely dependent on NO-mediated vasodilation.

### 5.3. Dyslipidemia & Metabolic Syndrome — Hawthorn for Lipids

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Evidence here is split along species lines. For the European species used in WS 1442, mechanistic and preclinical data strongly support a lipid-lowering effect of Hawthorn, and one observational cohort study in heart failure patients noted reduced need for diuretics. For the Chinese species *C. pinnatifida* (Shanzha), a meta-analysis of 14 RCTs found that traditional Chinese medicine formulations containing Hawthorn significantly improved total cholesterol and triglycerides compared to controls. However, this meta-analysis had a high risk of bias due to poor reporting of methodology, making conclusions about Hawthorn tentative. Human clinical data on Hawthorn's effect on glycemic control in metabolic syndrome is largely negative. One trial in Chinese patients with mild hypertension/hyperlipidemia found no significant difference in fasting plasma glucose between a Hawthorn drink and placebo, and another in diabetic patients found no meaningful hypoglycemic effect of Hawthorn despite reducing diastolic blood pressure.

### 5.4. Other Cardiovascular Conditions — Additional Uses of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn has been studied for angina pectoris, with a small trial of *C. pinnatifida* extract showing improved coronary blood flow and longer exercise duration without chest pain. A retrospective cohort study suggested that WS 1442 was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of atrial fibrillation and flutter compared to magnesium/potassium supplements. Hawthorn has also been investigated for orthostatic hypotension, where a combination of camphor and Hawthorn berry extract was found to be effective. However, evidence for pulmonary arterial hypertension is based on traditional use rather than clinical trials of Hawthorn.

## 6. Pharmacology — Hawthorn Mechanisms of Action

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The pharmacological actions of Hawthorn are complex and pleiotropic, stemming from Hawthorn's rich phytochemical composition, which includes flavonoids, oligomeric procyanidins (OPCs), triterpenic acids, and phenolic carboxylic acids. These compounds in Hawthorn work synergistically to produce a wide range of cardiovascular and systemic effects. The most thoroughly investigated preparations of Hawthorn are standardized extracts WS 1442 (from leaves and flowers) and LI 132 (from flowers), which contain defined quantities of OPCs and flavonoids, respectively.

### 6.1. Cardiac and Vascular Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn's primary pharmacological action is Hawthorn's positive inotropic effect on the heart, meaning Hawthorn strengthens the force of cardiac contractions. This effect of Hawthorn is unique because Hawthorn achieves this through a cAMP-independent mechanism, primarily by inhibiting the sarcolemmal Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This contrasts with catecholamines and cardiac glycosides, which rely on cAMP pathways and can increase myocardial oxygen demand and arrhythmogenicity. By enhancing intracellular calcium sensitivity without affecting L-type calcium currents, Hawthorn improves contractility more efficiently. Concurrently, Hawthorn induces peripheral and coronary vasodilation, which reduces afterload and increases coronary blood flow, further improving cardiac efficiency. This vasodilation by Hawthorn is mediated primarily by the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to increased production of nitric oxide (NO). Hawthorn also possesses antiarrhythmic properties, acting as a class III and possibly class I antiarrhythmic agent by prolonging the cardiac action potential duration and refractory period.

### 6.2. Anti-ischemic and Cardioprotective Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Preclinical and some clinical data suggest that Hawthorn protects the heart against ischemic injury. Hawthorn reduces the size of myocardial infarction and attenuates reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in animal models. This protection by Hawthorn is attributed to multiple mechanisms, including Hawthorn's potent antioxidant activity, which scavenges reactive oxygen species generated during ischemia/reperfusion, and Hawthorn's ability to inhibit neutrophil elastase, thereby reducing inflammation and tissue damage. Hawthorn also inhibits the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy in animal models of hypertension, an effect linked to Hawthorn's OPC fraction.

### 6.3. Lipid-Lowering and Anti-Atherogenic Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn demonstrates hypocholesterolemic effects through several pathways. Hawthorn upregulates the transcription of hepatic LDL receptors, which enhances the clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream. Simultaneously, Hawthorn downregulates the synthesis of apolipoprotein B, the main structural protein of LDL, thereby reducing the liver's secretion of VLDL and subsequent conversion to LDL. Furthermore, triterpenic acids in Hawthorn inhibit intestinal ACAT, an enzyme that esterifies cholesterol for incorporation into chylomicrons, thus reducing cholesterol absorption. These combined actions of Hawthorn contribute to a reduction in circulating LDL-C levels. Hawthorn also inhibits neointima formation in injured arteries, a key process in atherosclerosis and restenosis, by blocking PDGF receptor β phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells.

### 6.4. Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The flavonoids and procyanidins in Hawthorn are powerful antioxidants that directly neutralize free radicals and enhance the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like SOD and catalase. This mitigates oxidative stress, a key driver of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. At a cellular level, Hawthorn extracts inhibit the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a master regulator of inflammation, thereby suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. This anti-inflammatory action of Hawthorn is crucial for maintaining endothelial integrity and preventing the chronic inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease.

## 7. Pharmacokinetics — Hawthorn Absorption and Metabolism

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The pharmacokinetic profile of Hawthorn is complex, influenced by the specific phytochemical constituents, the extraction method, and the formulation of the final Hawthorn product. Despite extensive research, detailed human pharmacokinetic data for Hawthorn is still emerging, particularly concerning the absorption and metabolism of Hawthorn's key bioactive compounds.

### 7.1. Absorption of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Oral administration of standardized Hawthorn extracts leads to the absorption of Hawthorn's constituent polyphenols. In mice, oral absorption rates for various procyanidins from a radiolabeled Hawthorn extract ranged from 16–40%, with an average of about 31% for the total OPC fraction. However, the absorption of individual components of Hawthorn varies significantly. For instance, vitexin rhamnoside, a major flavonoid in some Hawthorn preparations, has very low oral bioavailability in humans, estimated at only 3.6%, suggesting extensive first-pass metabolism or poor permeability. In contrast, hyperoside showed significantly better absorption in rat intestinal loop studies. This indicates that while the whole Hawthorn extract may deliver a measurable amount of active ingredients, the bioavailability of individual marker compounds can be a limiting factor.

### 7.2. Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion of Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

After absorption, Hawthorn polyphenols undergo extensive metabolism. Key flavonoids like hyperoside, rutin, and their aglycones (quercetin, kaempferol) from Hawthorn are substrates for phase II metabolic enzymes, undergoing glucuronidation and sulfation. Intestinal microflora play a critical role in metabolism of Hawthorn, hydrolyzing glycosides to their more absorbable aglycone forms (e.g., converting rutin to quercetin and hyperoside to kaempferol). These aglycones are then absorbed and further metabolized. The resulting metabolites are distributed throughout the body and are ultimately excreted in urine and feces. Enterohepatic circulation is also observed with Hawthorn, where conjugated metabolites are deconjugated in the gut by bacterial enzymes, allowing for reabsorption, which can prolong their presence in the body. The influence of the herbal matrix on pharmacokinetics is notable; a study in rats found that when administered as part of the whole Hawthorn extract, the terminal elimination half-life of certain phenolics was longer and their volume of distribution was smaller compared to when given as pure compounds, suggesting that co-occurring plant components may modulate systemic behavior of Hawthorn, although this effect was most pronounced after intravenous administration.

### 7.3. Interactions and Formulation Impact — Hawthorn Product Variables

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The choice of extraction solvent and formulation significantly impacts the available evidence for Hawthorn. Standardized extracts like WS 1442 (45% ethanol) and LI 132 (70% methanol) are the subjects of most clinical trials and are designed to optimize the yield of key compounds like OPCs and flavonoids. Non-standardized Hawthorn preparations using water or simple ethanol have lower drug-extract ratios and may not deliver equivalent amounts of the active constituents, contributing to the variability seen in studies using different types of Hawthorn preparations. As for herb-drug interactions, clinical studies have not shown significant pharmacokinetic interactions of Hawthorn. A study in healthy volunteers found that co-administration of WS 1442 did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin, confirming safe co-administration of Hawthorn with this cardiac glycoside. Theoretical interactions could occur with other cardiovascular drugs due to overlapping pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., additive hypotensive effects with vasodilators), but these have not been widely reported in clinical settings with Hawthorn.

---

## 8. Dosing & Administration — Hawthorn Clinical Dosing

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The appropriate dosage of Hawthorn is critically dependent on the specific preparation, Hawthorn's standardization, and the intended indication. The vast majority of clinical evidence for Hawthorn is derived from two standardized extracts: WS 1442 and LI 132. Using non-standardized Hawthorn preparations lacks robust clinical support for efficacy and safety.

### 8.1. Standardized Extracts (WS 1442 & LI 132) — Evidence-Based Hawthorn Dosing

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

These are the most studied forms of Hawthorn and are recommended for clinical use.
*   **Crataegus Special Extract WS 1442:** This is a dry extract prepared from the leaves and flowering tops of *Crataegus monogyna* and *C. laevigata* using 45% ethanol as a solvent. This Hawthorn extract is standardized to contain 18.75% oligomeric procyanidins (OPCs). This Hawthorn extract has been evaluated in numerous clinical trials for chronic heart failure.
    *   **Dosage Range for Hawthorn:** Daily doses in clinical studies have varied from 240 mg to 1800 mg. Lower doses (e.g., 240 mg/day) have shown some benefit in improving exercise tolerance, while higher doses of Hawthorn (e.g., 900-1800 mg/day) have demonstrated more significant effects on workload and symptoms, particularly in more severe heart failure.
    *   **Typical Regimen for Hawthorn:** Doses are typically divided into 2-3 administrations per day.
*   **LI 132:** This is a dry extract prepared from the flowering tops of *Crataegus laevigata* using 70% methanol. This Hawthorn extract is standardized to contain 2.2% flavonoids, expressed as hyperoside. This Hawthorn extract has been studied in comparison to ACE inhibitors and for effects on blood pressure.
    *   **Dosage Range for Hawthorn:** Daily doses in clinical trials have ranged from 300 mg to 1200 mg.
    *   **Typical Regimen for Hawthorn:** Often administered as three 100 mg tablets daily or 600 mg twice daily.

### 8.2. Non-Standardized Preparations — Limited Evidence for Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

These preparations of Hawthorn lack the consistent marker compound concentrations required for reliable dosing and reproducible clinical outcomes.
*   **Tea/Infusion:** Prepared from dried Hawthorn leaves, flowers, or berries. The potency of Hawthorn tea is highly variable depending on the plant material, harvest time, and preparation method. Specific dosing guidelines for Hawthorn tea are not available from clinical trials.
*   **Liquid Extracts/Tinctures:** Typically made with water or alcohol. Potency of Hawthorn tincture depends on the extraction solvent and drug-to-solvent ratio. Again, dosing of Hawthorn tincture is not standardized.
*   **Whole Fruit/Berry Extracts:** Fresh berry extracts like Crataegisan have been studied, but at much lower daily doses (e.g., 3x30 drops) corresponding to only 6.4 mg of OPCs, yet still showed a significant effect on exercise tolerance.

### 8.3. Duration of Use — Hawthorn Treatment Timeline

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Effects of Hawthorn are not immediate and typically take several weeks to become apparent. Clinical trials have lasted from 8 to 16 weeks for acute benefits in heart failure and blood pressure, and up to 2 years in the SPICE trial for long-term prognosis. For chronic conditions, continuous use of Hawthorn for several months is generally recommended to assess efficacy.

### 8.4. Equivalencies and Clinical Context — Hawthorn Product Comparison

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

There are no direct, validated equivalencies between standardized and non-standardized preparations of Hawthorn. A clinician cannot reliably substitute a cup of Hawthorn tea for a specific milligram dose of WS 1442. The decision to use Hawthorn should be guided by the available evidence for a specific, standardized product. Given the conflicting results in modern CHF trials, Hawthorn's use as an adjunctive therapy for patients on guideline-directed medical therapy is not supported. Hawthorn may be considered as a complementary approach for mild hypertension or dyslipidemia, but Hawthorn's modest effect size must be acknowledged.

## 9. Safety & Toxicology — Hawthorn Adverse Effects

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn is generally regarded as a safe herbal remedy, particularly when standardized extracts are used. Extensive clinical trial data and post-marketing surveillance involving thousands of patients report a favorable safety profile of Hawthorn with a low incidence of adverse events. However, a comprehensive safety assessment of Hawthorn requires consideration of both clinical trial findings and global pharmacovigilance data, which reveals rare but serious potential risks, alongside specific dangers associated with certain plant species and unregulated Hawthorn products.

### 9.1. Adverse Events in Clinical Trials — Hawthorn Tolerability

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

In randomized controlled trials, adverse event (AE) rates with standardized Hawthorn extracts (WS 1442 and LI 132) are consistently comparable to, or sometimes even lower than, placebo groups. Analysis of 24 clinical studies involving over 5,500 patients found only 166 adverse events were reported with Hawthorn, with no serious AEs attributed to WS 1442. When AEs do occur with Hawthorn, they are typically mild, transient, and non-cardiac. The most commonly reported side effects of Hawthorn belong to several organ systems:
*   **Gastrointestinal Disorders with Hawthorn:** Nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most frequently cited AEs.
*   **Nervous System Disorders with Hawthorn:** Dizziness, vertigo, headache, and migraine are commonly reported.
*   **Cardiac Disorders with Hawthorn:** Palpitations can occur, although they are rare and often transient.
*   **General Disorders with Hawthorn:** Fatigue, sweating, and influenza-like symptoms have been reported.

It is noteworthy that in the large HERB CHF trial, the Hawthorn group actually reported a significantly higher rate of total adverse events (60% vs. 38% for placebo, P=0.02), driven by non-cardiac events, although the number of cardiac-related AEs was similar between groups. This underscores the importance of monitoring for all types of side effects with Hawthorn.

### 9.2. Serious Adverse Events and Pharmacovigilance — Hawthorn Risk Assessment

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Analysis of global pharmacovigilance databases provides a broader perspective on safety of Hawthorn. An examination of 1,527 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from VigiBase and 13 from the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb (2001–2023) found that the most frequently reported adverse reactions to Hawthorn were gastrointestinal, skin, general, cardiac, and nervous system disorders. Critically, among the 277 reports where a single-herb product was the sole suspected agent, 12.6% were classified as serious adverse events, indicating a small but real risk of severe reactions with Hawthorn. Serious case reports have included complete atrioventricular block, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, hepatitis, and rash. This suggests that while serious events with Hawthorn are rare, they can occur, and their causality can be difficult to establish definitively.

### 9.3. Species-Specific Toxicity and Genotoxicity — Hawthorn Species Differences

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

While extracts from European species like *C. monogyna* and *C. laevigata* are considered safe, toxicological data for other species of Hawthorn raise concerns. In vivo murine studies have shown that aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of *C. oxyacantha* leaf and bark exhibited genotoxic effects at high doses, increasing micronucleated erythrocytes. Another study found that *C. oxyacantha* fruit extract produced weak clastogenic effects at doses of 50–200 mg/kg in mice, independent of cytotoxicity, suggesting a potential genotoxic risk with prolonged, high-dose use of this Hawthorn species. Due to these findings, administration of these Hawthorn extracts during pregnancy is not recommended. Animal toxicity studies for the standardized WS 1442 extract have shown a wide margin of safety, with no signs of toxicity or genotoxicity of Hawthorn observed at oral doses up to 3000 mg/kg, which is over 100 times the standard human dose.

### 9.4. Contraindications and Pregnancy/Lactation — When to Avoid Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn should not be used by children. The use of Hawthorn during pregnancy and breastfeeding is largely unknown and should be avoided due to a lack of safety data and theoretical uterine stimulant effects from Hawthorn's amine content. Hawthorn is also contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the plant.

### 9.5. Hepatotoxicity — Hawthorn Liver Safety

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Extensive reviews of drug-induced liver injury registries have found no convincing evidence linking Hawthorn to hepatotoxicity. There is only one probable case of self-limited, anicteric hepatocellular injury reported in the Spanish registry, leading to an overall likelihood score of "unlikely cause" for Hawthorn. In fact, some preclinical evidence suggests Hawthorn may have hepatoprotective effects.

## 10. Interactions — Hawthorn Drug Interactions

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

The potential for herb-drug interactions is a critical consideration when recommending Hawthorn, particularly for patients with cardiovascular conditions who are often on multiple medications. While clinical trials have not revealed many clinically significant interactions with Hawthorn, the pharmacological profile of Hawthorn suggests theoretical risks that warrant caution and monitoring.

### 10.1. Digoxin — Hawthorn and Cardiac Glycosides

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

A primary theoretical concern stems from the fact that both Hawthorn and digoxin exert their positive inotropic effects via inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This raised the possibility of additive effects or toxicity. However, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers specifically investigated this interaction and found no statistically significant differences in digoxin's pharmacokinetic parameters (such as AUC, Cmax, and renal clearance) when co-administered with WS 1442. The study noted a slight, non-significant reduction in digoxin serum concentrations and a small increase in PR interval, suggesting a potential minor pharmacodynamic interaction but no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with Hawthorn. Post-marketing surveillance and other studies have also failed to report any interaction issues with cardioactive glycosides. Therefore, based on current evidence, concomitant use of Hawthorn with digoxin appears to be safe.

### 10.2. Antihypertensive Medications — Hawthorn and Blood Pressure Drugs

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn possesses vasodilatory and hypotensive properties. Theoretically, combining Hawthorn with conventional antihypertensive drugs (such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or alpha-adrenergic agonists) could lead to excessive blood pressure reduction and an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension. While no clinically substantiated interactions have been reported in human trials, this remains a plausible pharmacodynamic risk with Hawthorn that requires careful patient monitoring, especially when initiating Hawthorn therapy.

### 10.3. Antiarrhythmic Drugs — Hawthorn and Rhythm Control

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Given Hawthorn's antiarrhythmic effects (prolonging refractory period), there is a theoretical risk of additive effects when Hawthorn is combined with other antiarrhythmic agents. This could potentially increase the risk of bradycardia or other arrhythmias. As with other interactions, this has not been confirmed in clinical practice but warrants caution with Hawthorn.

### 10.4. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents — Hawthorn and Bleeding Risk

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Hawthorn contains compounds that may have antithrombotic and antiplatelet effects. Therefore, combining Hawthorn with conventional anticoagulants (like warfarin) or antiplatelet drugs (like aspirin or clopidogrel) could theoretically increase the risk of bleeding. A study in rats showed that a Hawthorn extract significantly increased cardiac antithrombin III levels, providing a potential mechanism for this interaction. Case reports have indicated that Hawthorn ingestion may increase postoperative bleeding rates, chest tube output, and mortality after cardiac surgery, reinforcing the need for caution. Patients should be advised to discontinue Hawthorn use at least one week before elective surgery.

### 10.5. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors — Hawthorn and Vasodilators

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Concomitant use of Hawthorn with PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) may cause an excessive drop in blood pressure due to their combined vasodilatory effects.

### 10.6. Other Considerations — Hawthorn Interaction Context

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Herbal Synergy:** The complex matrix of a whole plant extract may reduce the risk of interactions compared to isolated compounds, as constituents can modulate each other's absorption and metabolism.
*   **Unregulated Products:** The greatest risk lies with unstandardized Hawthorn products, especially those adulterated with other substances. For example, *C. mexicana* (tejocote) root has been found to cross-react with digoxin immunoassays, causing falsely elevated serum digoxin levels and complicating diagnosis and treatment.

In summary, while standardized Hawthorn extracts appear to have a low risk of clinically significant interactions, Hawthorn's cardiovascular effects necessitate caution when used with conventional cardiovascular drugs. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is advisable, and patients should always disclose their use of Hawthorn to their healthcare providers.

## 11. Comparative Analysis (vs. Standard of Care) — Hawthorn Clinical Position

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

A comparative analysis of Hawthorn against the standard of care (SoC) for Hawthorn's primary indications—chronic heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and dyslipidemia—reveals a complex picture. While Hawthorn offers a favorable safety profile and multimodal mechanisms of action, Hawthorn's efficacy, particularly as an adjunctive therapy, is modest and often fails to meet the benchmarks set by modern pharmaceutical interventions.

### 11.1. Chronic Heart Failure (NYHA Class II) — Hawthorn vs. Modern CHF Treatment

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Historically, Hawthorn was positioned as a natural alternative or complement to conventional heart failure medications. Early studies and meta-analyses suggested that standardized extracts like WS 1442 and LI 132 were comparable to low-dose captopril (an ACE inhibitor) in improving symptoms and exercise capacity, but with fewer side effects. The German Commission E approved Hawthorn for NYHA Stage II heart failure, reflecting this perceived equivalence. However, this view about Hawthorn has been fundamentally undermined by recent high-quality trials. The HERB CHF trial, which tested Hawthorn as an add-on to contemporary SoC (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics), found no additional symptomatic or functional benefit of Hawthorn over placebo. Similarly, the SPICE trial, the largest of its kind, found that adding WS 1442 to SoC did not reduce the primary endpoint of cardiac events or mortality. Therefore, in the modern therapeutic landscape, Hawthorn does not offer a meaningful advantage over the SoC for improving outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe CHF. Hawthorn's SoC is not a proven benefit, but rather the absence of harm, as Hawthorn is generally well-tolerated.

### 11.2. Hypertension — Hawthorn vs. Antihypertensive Drugs

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

For hypertension, Hawthorn's SoC is a wide array of first-line pharmaceutical agents (e.g., thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers). The evidence for Hawthorn is that Hawthorn produces a modest, statistically significant reduction in blood pressure, particularly systolic BP, with a mean decrease of around -6.65 mmHg in one meta-analysis. While this effect of Hawthorn is clinically meaningful, it is substantially smaller than the reductions achieved with first-line antihypertensives, which typically lower SBP by 10-15 mmHg and DBP by 8-10 mmHg. Thus, Hawthorn cannot be considered a replacement for SoC in patients with diagnosed hypertension. Instead, Hawthorn's role is likely as a complementary or supportive therapy for borderline or mild hypertension, or for individuals seeking to reduce their reliance on pharmaceuticals, with the important caveat that Hawthorn's effect size is limited.

### 11.3. Dyslipidemia — Hawthorn vs. Statins

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

In the management of dyslipidemia, the SoC includes lifestyle modifications and statin-class medications. Hawthorn's evidence for lipid-lowering is stronger in preclinical and mechanistic terms than in clinical trials. Hawthorn's proposed mechanisms—upregulating LDL receptors and inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption—are similar to those of statins and ezetimibe, respectively. However, clinical data from Chinese studies using *C. pinnatifida*-containing formulas show mixed results, with one study demonstrating a marginal beneficial effect of Hawthorn on LDL-C. Crucially, these studies suffer from a high risk of bias, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about Hawthorn. Compared to statins, which can lower LDL-C by 30-50%, the effect of Hawthorn is expected to be far more modest. Therefore, Hawthorn does not compete with the SoC for treating significant hyperlipidemia but may serve as a supportive agent in a holistic approach to managing mild elevations in cholesterol.

In essence, Hawthorn occupies a niche position relative to the SoC. Hawthorn is not a superior alternative for primary treatment of hypertension or dyslipidemia, nor is Hawthorn an effective adjunct to modern, guideline-directed therapy for CHF. Hawthorn's value lies in Hawthorn's excellent safety profile and Hawthorn's potential to provide mild, supportive benefits for certain cardiovascular parameters, making Hawthorn a candidate for integrative approaches in carefully selected, low-risk populations.

## 12. Clinical Decision Rules (IF/THEN/BECAUSE) — Hawthorn Treatment Guidelines

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Based on the comprehensive evidence, the following IF/THEN/BECAUSE rules provide actionable guidance for clinicians considering the use of Hawthorn.

### 12.1. Rule 1: For Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Heart Failure (NYHA Class II-III) on Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy — Do Not Use Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **IF** a patient has moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-III).
*   **AND** the patient is currently receiving optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (including an ACE inhibitor/ARB, a beta-blocker, and a diuretic).
*   **THEN** Hawthorn should not be prescribed as an adjunctive therapy.
*   **BECAUSE** the HERB CHF and SPICE trials demonstrated no additional symptomatic, functional, or prognostic benefit when standardized Hawthorn extract (WS 1442) was added to this standard regimen. The benefits seen in earlier, smaller trials with Hawthorn may have been confounded by the lack of these potent modern medications. Adding Hawthorn would therefore be an unnecessary expense with no proven clinical advantage.

### 12.2. Rule 2: For Mild Chronic Heart Failure (NYHA Class I-II) Without Advanced Comorbidities — Consider Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **IF** a patient has mild chronic heart failure (NYHA Class I-II).
*   **AND** the patient is not yet on a full complement of guideline-directed medical therapy (e.g., no beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor).
*   **THEN** a discussion about using a standardized Hawthorn extract (WS 1442 or LI 132) as a supportive therapy may be considered.
*   **BECAUSE** the bulk of positive clinical evidence for Hawthorn comes from trials conducted in patients with mild heart failure. In this population, the potential benefits of Hawthorn on symptoms and exercise tolerance may outweigh the risks, especially if the patient prefers a natural approach or has contraindications to conventional drugs. However, this is an off-label use of Hawthorn, and the clinician must manage expectations regarding the modest nature of Hawthorn's effect.

### 12.3. Rule 3: For Borderline or Mild Hypertension — Consider Hawthorn as Complementary

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **IF** a patient has borderline or stage 1 hypertension.
*   **THEN** Hawthorn extract (LI 132) may be considered as a complementary therapy alongside lifestyle modifications.
*   **BECAUSE** meta-analyses have shown a modest but statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure with Hawthorn use. Hawthorn is not a replacement for first-line pharmaceutical agents in moderate-to-severe hypertension but may help achieve target goals in milder cases or reduce the required dose of antihypertensive medication.

### 12.4. Rule 4: For Hyperlipidemia Associated with Metabolic Syndrome — Consider Hawthorn in Multi-Modal Approach

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **IF** a patient has mild hyperlipidemia, particularly elevated triglycerides or LDL-C, as part of a broader metabolic syndrome profile.
*   **THEN** a standardized Hawthorn extract (WS 1442) could be discussed as part of a multi-pronged approach to lipid management.
*   **BECAUSE** strong preclinical and mechanistic data support Hawthorn's lipid-lowering effects through multiple pathways, including LDL receptor upregulation. While clinical evidence for Hawthorn is less robust, Hawthorn's excellent safety profile makes it a reasonable addition to diet and exercise counseling. Hawthorn's effect will be modest compared to statins.

### 12.5. Rule 5: For Patients Considering Weight Loss Supplements — Screen for Tejocote

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **IF** a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of cardiac toxicity (e.g., bradycardia, chest pain, palpitations) and admits to using a dietary supplement for weight loss.
*   **THEN** inquire specifically about the use of products labeled "tejocote root."
*   **BECAUSE** there is a severe public health crisis involving the adulteration of *Crataegus mexicana* (tejocote) root supplements with yellow oleander (*Cascabela thevetia*), a plant containing a lethal cardenolide toxin. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate cessation of the product and urgent medical evaluation.

## 13. Case Studies & Clinical Pearls — Hawthorn in Practice

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

### 13.1. Case Study 1: The Patient with Stable NYHA Class II Heart Failure — Hawthorn Not Indicated

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Presentation:** A 65-year-old woman with a history of stable NYHA Class II heart failure (LVEF 45%) is doing well on lisinopril 10 mg daily and metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily. She expresses interest in "natural" ways to improve her energy levels and breathing. Her doctor recalls the older literature supporting Hawthorn.
*   **Pearl:** The clinician correctly identifies that the patient is on optimal guideline-directed medical therapy. According to the latest evidence, adding Hawthorn would be ineffective and unnecessary. The conversation pivots to discussing the importance of adherence to her current regimen, optimizing her diuretic dose if needed, and encouraging a structured exercise program, which has been shown to be more effective than Hawthorn for functional improvement in CHF.

### 13.2. Case Study 2: The Patient with Mild Hypertension — Hawthorn as Complementary

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Presentation:** A 52-year-old man with newly diagnosed borderline hypertension (BP consistently 145/92 mmHg) is hesitant to start medication. He has read about Hawthorn and asks if it would be a good option.
*   **Pearl:** The clinician acknowledges the patient's preference and explains that Hawthorn can produce a modest lowering of blood pressure, which may be helpful. The clinician recommends a high-quality, standardized Hawthorn extract like LI 132 (1200 mg/day) and schedules close follow-up to monitor his blood pressure. The clinician emphasizes that this is a supportive measure and that he must continue monitoring his BP closely, as Hawthorn is unlikely to normalize his readings without other interventions.

### 13.3. Case Study 3: The Emergency Department Presentation — Tejocote Toxicity

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Presentation:** A 38-year-old man presents to the ED with severe bradycardia (heart rate 35 bpm), nausea, and shortness of breath. He reports using a "herbal weight loss formula" for the past week. The initial electrocardiogram shows a Mobitz Type I second-degree AV block.
*   **Pearl:** The clinician immediately suspects poisoning from an adulterated Hawthorn product. The patient's use of a "weight loss formula" is a red flag for potential yellow oleander contamination. The patient is treated supportively, and the Hawthorn-containing product is sent for testing. This case highlights the critical danger of unregulated herbal supplements and the importance of asking specific questions about their use in patients presenting with unexplained cardiac symptoms.

### 13.4. Clinical Pearl 1: The Importance of Standardization — Choose Hawthorn Products Carefully

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Insight:** The term "Hawthorn" is not a single entity. The vast majority of positive clinical evidence comes from two specific, well-characterized standardized extracts of Hawthorn: WS 1442 (from leaves/flowers, standardized to oligomeric procyanidins) and LI 132 (from flowers, standardized to flavonoids). Recommending a generic "Hawthorn tea" or an unstandardized tincture is inappropriate as there is no clinical evidence to support efficacy or safety of these Hawthorn preparations. Clinicians should only recommend Hawthorn products that specify the species (*monogyna*, *laevigata*) and the exact standardized extract (e.g., WS 1442).

### 13.5. Clinical Pearl 2: Managing Expectations — Hawthorn Has Modest Effects

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Insight:** Even when Hawthorn may be appropriate, Hawthorn's effects are often modest. It is crucial to manage patient expectations. For CHF, Hawthorn is not a miracle cure but may offer a small subjective improvement in symptoms. For hypertension or dyslipidemia, Hawthorn is a supportive agent, not a replacement for lifestyle changes or prescribed medication. Setting realistic goals about Hawthorn prevents disappointment and ensures patients adhere to evidence-based therapies.

### 13.6. Clinical Pearl 3: The Hidden Danger of *Crataegus mexicana* — Warn About Tejocote

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Insight:** The traditional Mexican species *Crataegus mexicana* (tejocote) root poses a significant and dangerous risk. This Hawthorn product is frequently sold online for weight loss but is often contaminated or entirely substituted with yellow oleander, a deadly plant. Furthermore, ingestion of *C. mexicana* alone can cause false-positive digoxin levels, creating a diagnostic trap. Clinicians must actively counsel patients against purchasing Hawthorn products from unverified online sources and specifically warn them about the dangers of "tejocote root" supplements.

---

## 14. Red Flags & Triage Parameters — Hawthorn Safety Monitoring

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

Clinicians must be vigilant for specific red flags that may indicate a serious adverse reaction to Hawthorn or the presence of a dangerous adulterant. A triage algorithm can help guide appropriate clinical response.

### 14.1. Red Flag 1: Unexplained Bradycardia or Arrhythmia — Hawthorn Cardiac Effects

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Description:** A patient develops a slow heart rate (<50 bpm) or reports palpitations, skipped beats, or irregular rhythms shortly after starting Hawthorn.
*   **Triage Parameter:** Suspect direct cardiac effects or, more critically, adulteration of Hawthorn with a potent cardiac glycoside.
*   **Action:** Immediately discontinue the Hawthorn product. Perform an ECG to characterize the rhythm. If bradycardia is profound or symptomatic, seek emergency consultation. Send the remaining Hawthorn product for laboratory analysis to check for contaminants like yellow oleander and perform a digoxin level (which may be falsely elevated by *C. mexicana*).

### 14.2. Red Flag 2: Signs of Severe Gastrointestinal Distress — Hawthorn GI Effects

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Description:** A patient experiences severe, persistent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.
*   **Triage Parameter:** While GI upset is a common, usually mild AE with Hawthorn, severe symptoms may indicate intolerance or an underlying condition exacerbated by the supplement.
*   **Action:** Discontinue the Hawthorn product and evaluate the patient for dehydration or other causes of GI distress. Reassess the necessity of Hawthorn therapy.

### 14.3. Red Flag 3: Signs of Allergic Reaction or Skin Toxicity — Hawthorn Hypersensitivity

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Description:** A patient develops a widespread rash, urticaria (hives), or angioedema after starting Hawthorn.
*   **Triage Parameter:** This indicates a hypersensitivity reaction to Hawthorn.
*   **Action:** Discontinue the Hawthorn product immediately. Treat with antihistamines as needed. Refer to an allergist if the reaction is severe or recurrent. Document the reaction to Hawthorn in the patient's allergy list.

### 14.4. Red Flag 4: History of Use of "Tejocote Root" for Weight Loss — Emergency with Hawthorn

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Description:** A patient presents with any cardiac complaint (chest pain, palpitations, syncope) and has a history of using a supplement purchased online for weight loss that was labeled as "tejocote root."
*   **Triage Parameter:** High suspicion for poisoning with yellow oleander (*Cascabela thevetia*).
*   **Action:** This is a medical emergency. Immediately discontinue the product. Activate emergency services. Transport the patient to the nearest emergency department for intensive cardiac monitoring and treatment. This situation requires urgent intervention and cannot be managed on an outpatient basis.

### 14.5. Red Flag 5: Increased Shortness of Breath or Swelling — Hawthorn Heart Failure Worsening

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Description:** A patient with known heart failure notices a worsening of their symptoms (increased dyspnea, leg swelling, orthopnea) after starting Hawthorn.
*   **Triage Parameter:** This could be a sign of heart failure progression, which was suggested by a retrospective analysis of the HERB CHF trial.
*   **Action:** Evaluate the patient promptly for signs of fluid overload. Increase diuretic dose as clinically indicated. Consider adjusting other heart failure medications. Strongly consider discontinuing Hawthorn until the patient's condition stabilizes and their response to the SoC is optimized.

By recognizing these red flags and applying clear triage parameters, clinicians can ensure patient safety and intervene appropriately when complications arise from the use of Hawthorn.

## 15. Research Frontiers (Next 5 Years) — Future Hawthorn Research

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

While the role of Hawthorn in mainstream cardiology is being clarified by large-scale trials, several exciting research frontiers are emerging that could redefine Hawthorn's therapeutic potential in the coming years. Future research on Hawthorn should focus on addressing existing gaps in knowledge and exploring novel mechanisms of action.

### 15.1. Role in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) — Hawthorn New Target

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Question:** Can Hawthorn improve outcomes in HFpEF, a condition with limited effective pharmacotherapies?
*   **Rationale:** The SPICE trial, while negative for HFrEF, hinted at a potential benefit of Hawthorn in patients with better-preserved LVEF. An exploratory trial in HFpEF patients showed that adding WS 1442 to endurance training improved exercise capacity. This suggests a potential role of Hawthorn in improving myocardial relaxation, endothelial function, or diastolic properties.
*   **Future Work:** A dedicated, placebo-controlled RCT in a large cohort of HFpEF patients is needed to investigate whether Hawthorn can improve functional capacity, quality of life, and biomarkers of diastolic dysfunction.

### 15.2. Regenerative and Progenitor Cell Stimulation — Hawthorn Cardiac Repair

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Question:** Can Hawthorn stimulate cardiac repair and regeneration after injury?
*   **Rationale:** Preclinical studies have shown that WS 1442 can promote the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiovascular progenitor cells and stimulate angiogenesis ex vivo. This suggests a novel mechanism of Hawthorn beyond its traditional inotropic and vasodilatory effects.
*   **Future Work:** In vivo studies in animal models of myocardial infarction are needed to determine if Hawthorn can reduce scar size, improve cardiac function, and enhance neovascularization. This could open a new avenue for post-infarction therapy with Hawthorn.

### 15.3. Definitive Investigation of Antiarrhythmic Effects — Hawthorn Rhythm Control

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Question:** Does Hawthorn reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death in specific subgroups of heart failure patients?
*   **Rationale:** The subgroup analysis from the SPICE trial, which showed a 39.7% reduction in sudden cardiac death in patients with LVEF ≥25% taking Hawthorn, is a compelling but preliminary finding.
*   **Future Work:** A dedicated trial focusing on patients with moderately depressed but not severely compromised LVEF (e.g., 25-40%) would be warranted to confirm this antiarrhythmic effect of Hawthorn. Such a study could identify a specific patient population that would benefit most from Hawthorn therapy.

### 15.4. Resolution of Pharmacokinetic and Bioavailability Issues — Optimizing Hawthorn Delivery

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Question:** How can the low oral bioavailability of key Hawthorn flavonoids be overcome to maximize therapeutic effects?
*   **Rationale:** Studies show that the bioavailability of major flavonoids like vitexin rhamnoside is very low, limiting their systemic exposure. Understanding how the herbal matrix influences absorption and metabolism of Hawthorn is key.
*   **Future Work:** Research should focus on developing novel delivery systems for Hawthorn (e.g., nanoparticles, phospholipid complexes) to enhance the bioavailability of active compounds. Further studies are also needed to clarify the precise contribution of gut microbiota to the metabolism and efficacy of Hawthorn.

### 15.5. Comprehensive Safety and Quality Control of Commercial Products — Hawthorn Market Safety

**Herb:** Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)

*   **Question:** What is the true extent of adulteration and contamination in the global herbal market for Hawthorn?
*   **Rationale:** The crisis surrounding *C. mexicana* adulteration with yellow oleander highlights the critical need for robust quality control and consumer protection. Pesticide contamination in Hawthorn leaf products is also a concern.
*   **Future Work:** Large-scale, systematic screening of commercially available Hawthorn products from various markets is urgently needed. Developing and validating rapid, cost-effective analytical methods for detecting common adulterants (like yellow oleander) and residual pesticides in Hawthorn would empower regulators and consumers alike.

Addressing these research frontiers will provide a more complete and nuanced understanding of Hawthorn, potentially identifying new, evidence-based roles for this ancient remedy in modern medicine.
