## Quick Reference: Clinician TL;DR

### **Grade A Evidence (High Confidence)**
- **Dry Eye Syndrome**: 2 g/day sea buckthorn oil for 3 months. Significantly attenuates tear film osmolarity increase (ITT P=0.04) and reduces redness/burning symptoms.
- **Vulvovaginal Atrophy (Postmenopausal)**: Topical sea buckthorn oil 3 g/day for 3 months. Significantly improves vaginal epithelial integrity (P=0.03) through non-estrogenic mechanism.

### **Grade B Evidence (Moderate Confidence)**
- **Atopic Dermatitis**: 5 g/day sea buckthorn pulp oil for 4 months. Significant improvement in AD symptoms vs. placebo (P < 0.01).
- **Hyperlipidemia/Dyslipidemia**: Meta-analysis of 15 RCTs shows significant improvements: SMD -0.345 (TC), -0.722 (TG), -0.396 (LDL-C), +0.370 (HDL-C). Effects primarily in individuals with pre-existing dyslipidemia.
- **Hypertension**: 0.75 mL/day sea buckthorn seed oil for 30 days normalizes BP in hypertensive subjects; no effect in normotensive individuals.

### **Grade C Evidence (Limited/Weak Evidence)**
- **Liver Fibrosis/NAFLD**: 15 g tid sea buckthorn extract for 6 months. Statistically significant reductions in fibrosis markers (laminin, HA, Collagen III/IV).
- **Impaired Glucose Regulation**: 90 mL/day sea buckthorn fruit puree for 5 weeks. Small but significant downward trend in fasting glucose (-0.13 ± 0.56 mmol/L).
- **Wound Healing (Burns)**: Topical sea buckthorn cream significantly shorter healing time vs. silver sulfadiazine (p < 0.001).
- **Gastric Ulcer**: Strong preclinical evidence (up to 70% reduction in lesion index in rat models), but robust human clinical trial data lacking.

### **Safety Profile**
- **Generally Well-Tolerated**: NOAEL of 10 mL/kg body weight per day in rats. No significant adverse effects in human trials (4-12 weeks).
- **Common AEs**: Gastrointestinal symptoms (~10% of users), carotenodermia (benign yellow skin discoloration, dose-dependent).
- **Pregnancy/Lactation**: Avoidance recommended due to insufficient reliable safety data.
- **Drug Interactions**: Caution with anticoagulants/antiplatelets (increased bleeding risk), antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effects), antidiabetic drugs (hypoglycemia risk).

## Core Pharmacological Summary

### **Active Constituents**
- **Fatty Acids**: Distinct profiles in seed oil (omega-3/omega-6 rich) vs. pulp oil (omega-7/palmitoleic acid rich, up to 43%)
- **Flavonoids**: Isoflavones (isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin) - main characteristic ingredients
- **Proanthocyanidins**: Unique high content of gallocatechin and epigallocatechin monomers
- **Carotenoids**: β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin (highest in pulp oil)
- **Tocopherols (Vitamin E)**: α-tocopherol dominant in pulp oil
- **Vitamins**: Extremely high Vitamin C in berries, plus Vitamin A, K, B-complex
- **Phytosterols**: β-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol (highest in seed oil)
- **Organic Acids**: Oxalic, tartaric, malic, ascorbic acids with direct antibacterial activity against *H. pylori*

### **Mechanisms of Action**
- **Antioxidant**: Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins scavenge free radicals, chelate metal ions, protect endothelial cells
- **Anti-inflammatory**: NF-κB, MAPK, TLR4/IL-6/STAT3 pathway inhibition; reduces TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, ICAM-1, VCAM-1
- **Cardioprotective**: AMPK/SIRT1 and PPAR pathway activation; modulates lipid metabolism via omega-3/omega-6 PUFAs
- **Metabolic**: Palmitoleic acid activates G protein-coupled receptors in pancreatic β-cells, enhancing insulin secretion
- **Gastroprotective**: Proanthocyanidins reduce PAF expression, increase midkine; organic acids inhibit *H. pylori* growth and virulence
- **Gut Microbiota Modulation**: Polysaccharides increase beneficial genera (*Lactobacillus*, *Roseburia*), decrease harmful ones
- **Antiplatelet**: Inhibits platelet aggregation (mechanism for cardiovascular protection but also bleeding risk)

### **Key Pharmacological Challenges**
- **Low Bioavailability**: Flavonoids have poor oral bioavailability due to poor solubility, gut microbiota metabolism, and rapid excretion
- **Formulation-Specific Effects**: Seed oil vs. pulp oil have vastly different fatty acid profiles and clinical applications
- **Synergistic Activity**: Benefits arise from complex synergy of multiple compounds rather than single marker compounds

## Introduction & Traditional Use

Sea buckthorn, scientifically known as *Hippophae rhamnoides*, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Elaeagnaceae family [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [48](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202505.0232)]. It is characterized by its thorny branches, silvery-gray foliage, and bright orange-yellow berries [[11](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-sea-buckthorn), [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389226/)]. Native to coastal and sub-alpine regions of northern and central Europe, the Caucasus, and western Asia, it has been naturalized in many temperate zones [[11](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-sea-buckthorn), [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389226/)]. The plant has a long history of medicinal and nutritional use, dating back thousands of years across multiple cultures [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [125](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00467-6)]. In Russia and China, it has been used for centuries for a wide range of ailments [[3](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/sea-buckthorn-uses-and-risks), [125](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00467-6)]. Its reputation as a potent healing agent led to its inclusion in the Russian Pharmacopeia in the 1950s and the Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1977 [[125](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00467-6)]. The fruit is often referred to as 'Siberian pineapple' due to its distinctive aroma and bitter-sour taste [[11](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-sea-buckthorn), [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389226/)], while the name *Hippophae* originates from ancient Greece, where horses were fed the berries to improve their coat shine [[83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389226/)].

The traditional applications of sea buckthorn are extensive, reflecting its perceived broad-spectrum therapeutic properties. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Mongolian medicine, and Tibetan medicine, the dried berries (*Fructus Hippophae*) are recognized for invigorating the spleen, eliminating food stagnation, relieving cough with phlegm, promoting blood circulation, and dispersing blood stasis [[125](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00467-6), [134](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1430768/full)]. It has been used for pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiac, hepatic, and metabolic disorders, as well as gynecological diseases and skin conditions [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html)]. In Russia, it was traditionally employed for gastrointestinal issues like gastritis and ulcers, skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, rheumatism, jaundice, hepatitis, asthma, and even internal blood clots [[125](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00467-6)]. Similarly, in Central Asian and Indian folk medicine, it has been used for digestive problems, hypertension, inflammation, and wound healing [[125](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00467-6)]. This rich ethnobotanical history provides a foundation for modern clinical inquiry into its potential benefits for conditions like dermatological, ophthalmological, and cardiovascular health [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html)].

## Pharmacology & Mechanisms of Action

The diverse pharmacological effects of sea buckthorn are attributed to its complex phytochemical profile, which includes over 190 bioactive compounds [[14](https://www.healthspan.co.uk/guides/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-oil-and-omega-7/?srsltid=AfmBOorndFjawr_z24Drb0bzSs789wVIh636rplTUyWHiLrS-gOVfo8W), [84](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224425000809)]. These compounds act through multiple interconnected pathways to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and metabolic regulatory activities. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for contextualizing its clinical applications. The primary classes of active compounds include fatty acids, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids, each contributing uniquely to its overall biological activity [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [29](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359158443_Effect_of_Sea_buckthorn_in_preventing_cardiovascular_diseases_in_human_beings)].

### Fatty Acids: Seed Oil vs. Pulp Oil

Fatty acids constitute a major component of sea buckthorn oil, with distinct profiles in seed versus pulp oil that dictate their functional differences. Seed oil is rich in omega-6 (linoleic acid, up to 42%) and omega-3 (α-linolenic acid, 20–35%) fatty acids, creating a nearly 1:1 ratio [[16](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-019-1065-9), [86](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034099&utm_source=chatgpt.com)]. These polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are precursors to eicosanoids and are central to its cardioprotective effects, particularly in modulating lipid metabolism via activation of AMPK/SIRT1 and PPAR signaling pathways [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224416300322)]. They also contribute to skin barrier integrity and may influence inflammatory processes [[16](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-019-1065-9), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6589177/)]. Conversely, pulp oil is dominated by palmitoleic acid (omega-7), which can reach up to 43% of total fatty acids [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10217465/), [16](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-019-1065-9)]. Palmitoleic acid plays a critical role in maintaining mucosal hydration and has been shown to inhibit melanogenesis, suggesting its importance in skin health and wound healing [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6589177/), [38](https://www.iherb.com/blog/sea-buckthorn-berry-eye-benefits/2198?srsltid=AfmBOop6zejk3cyCrsT4D5ByV852Dpt70P65xcawgNyNp8WrRBqCEvAj)]. It also activates G protein-coupled receptors in pancreatic β-cells, enhancing glucose-induced insulin secretion, which provides a mechanistic basis for its observed effects on glucose metabolism [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10217465/), [16](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-019-1065-9)].

### Flavonoids: Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Mechanisms

Flavonoids, particularly isorhamnetin and quercetin, are considered the main characteristic ingredients of sea buckthorn [[50](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ra/d0ra06488b), [55](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33856060/)]. These compounds exhibit potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting key signaling pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, and TLR4/IL-6/STAT3 [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [50](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ra/d0ra06488b)]. They reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and inhibit adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, thereby protecting vascular endothelial cells from injury [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [29](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359158443_Effect_of_Sea_buckthorn_in_preventing_cardiovascular_diseases_in_human_beings)]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that sea buckthorn flavonoids induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines (liver, breast, colon) and inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [134](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1430768/full)]. However, a significant challenge is their low oral bioavailability, which is influenced by poor solubility, gut microbiota metabolism, and rapid excretion [[55](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33856060/), [57](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfbc.13724)]. Despite this, clinical studies confirm their systemic absorption and measurable effects, such as increasing plasma levels of isorhamnetin and quercetin after berry consumption [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11527678/), [56](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf061889r)].

### Proanthocyanidins and Gastroprotective Effects

Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are another important class of polyphenols unique to sea buckthorn due to their high content of gallocatechin and epigallocatechin monomers [[49](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395645649_From_Desert_Greening_to_Human_Health_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Extraction_Unique_Structure_and_Bioactivity_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Proanthocyanidins)]. These PAs possess strong antioxidant capacity, capable of scavenging free radicals and chelating metal ions [[49](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395645649_From_Desert_Greening_to_Human_Health_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Extraction_Unique_Structure_and_Bioactivity_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Proanthocyanidins)]. In preclinical models, they protect endothelial cells from oxidative damage and reduce lipid peroxidation [[46](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772566925000345), [49](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395645649_From_Desert_Greening_to_Human_Health_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Extraction_Unique_Structure_and_Bioactivity_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Proanthocyanidins)]. Clinically, a standardized proanthocyanidin-rich extract (CyanthOx™) has been shown to be effective in treating chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer, likely by reducing gastric mucosal expression of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and increasing the protective factor midkine (MK) [[67](https://www.puredia.com/health-benefit/gut)]. Furthermore, organic acid extracts from the fruit, containing oxalic, tartaric, and malic acids, have demonstrated direct antibacterial activity against *Helicobacter pylori* by inhibiting its growth, urease activity, and virulence gene expression [[65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944501325000898)]. This provides a plausible mechanism for its traditional use in treating gastrointestinal conditions like gastritis and ulcers [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944501325000898)]. Finally, sea buckthorn polysaccharides have been shown to modulate the gut microbiota, increasing beneficial genera like *Lactobacillus* and *Roseburia* while decreasing harmful ones, which contributes to improved lipid profiles and reduced inflammation [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9773879/), [73](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1067813/full)].

## Dosing & Administration Protocols

Determining an appropriate dose for sea buckthorn requires careful consideration of the specific indication, the formulation being used, and the patient's underlying health status. The available clinical data provides several evidence-based protocols, though optimal dosing is not yet universally established for all conditions [[3](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/sea-buckthorn-uses-and-risks), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. Formulations vary widely, including oils (seed, pulp, whole berry), juices, freeze-dried powders, and extracts, each with distinct bioactive profiles that necessitate different dosing strategies [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [15](https://draxe.com/nutrition/sea-buckthorn-oil/)]. For instance, the fatty acid composition differs dramatically between seed oil (rich in omega-3 and omega-6) and pulp oil (rich in omega-7), leading to divergent clinical applications [[16](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-019-1065-9), [86](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034099&utm_source=chatgpt.com)]. Therefore, dosing recommendations must be tailored to the specific product being administered.

For **atopic dermatitis**, clinical evidence points towards oral supplementation with sea buckthorn pulp oil. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 49 patients found that a daily dose of 5 grams of pulp oil for four months resulted in significant improvements in dermatitis symptoms compared to placebo [[113](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15539258/)]. Another study noted that seed oil did not produce a similar significant improvement, highlighting the importance of using the correct formulation [[113](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15539258/)]. For **dry eye syndrome**, a consistent dosage of 2 grams of sea buckthorn oil per day has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial lasting three months, demonstrating a reduction in both objective measures (tear film osmolarity) and subjective symptoms like redness and burning [[31](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20554904/), [35](https://www.puredia.com/news-content/omegia-sea-buckthorn-oil-for-dry-eye)]. In the context of **vulvovaginal atrophy**, topical application of a vaginal gel containing sea buckthorn oil at a dose of 3 grams per day for three months was shown to significantly improve vaginal epithelial integrity in postmenopausal women [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10662087/), [59](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11101-022-09832-1)].

In cardiovascular health, dosing is highly dependent on the target outcome and patient population. For lowering blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, a longitudinal controlled trial successfully used a very small volume of 0.75 mL of sea buckthorn seed oil daily for 30 days [[40](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27522605/), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11527678/)]. For improving lipid profiles in those with dyslipidemia, a broader range of doses has been used. One meta-analysis included trials using 0.75 mL/day of seed oil [[71](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36043374/)], while others used higher amounts, such as 28 grams of puree daily for 90 days or 3 grams of oil daily for three months [[54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11527678/), [59](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11101-022-09832-1)]. It is critical to note that these lipid-lowering effects appear to be most pronounced in individuals with existing metabolic risk factors and were not observed in healthy subjects, reinforcing the need for targeted therapy [[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224416300322), [95](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7cb2/aef54cf338679fcd3054baa8e9f9f9647242.pdf)].

## Safety Profile & Toxicology

The safety profile of sea buckthorn appears to be favorable based on extensive toxicological evaluations in animal models and a growing body of human clinical trial data. Multiple sub-chronic toxicity studies have established a high margin of safety. An acute oral toxicity study in mice reported no mortality or signs of toxicity at a dose of 20 mL/kg body weight of sea buckthorn oil, indicating a lethal dose (LD50) greater than this amount [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28986179/), [102](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215928058_Safety_and_Efficacy_Study_of_Intramuscularly_Administered_Seabuckthorn_Hippophae_Rhamnoides_L_Oil_as_Depot_Formulation)]. Further, a 90-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats found that doses up to 10 mL/kg body weight per day caused no treatment-related adverse effects on mortality, body weight, organ weights, food consumption, or hematological and biochemical parameters [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28986179/), [102](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215928058_Safety_and_Efficacy_Study_of_Intramuscularly_Administered_Seabuckthorn_Hippophae_Rhamnoides_L_Oil_as_Depot_Formulation)]. Based on these findings, a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 10 mL/kg body weight per day was determined for both male and female rats [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28986179/), [102](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215928058_Safety_and_Efficacy_Study_of_Intramuscularly_Administered_Seabuckthorn_Hippophae_Rhamnoides_L_Oil_as_Depot_Formulation)]. Genotoxicity and teratogenicity studies have further supported its safety, showing no mutagenic activity in Salmonella strains, no adverse effects on sperm morphology, and no embryotoxicity in pregnant rats [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [59](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11101-022-09832-1), [102](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215928058_Safety_and_Efficacy_Study_of_Intramuscularly_Administered_Seabuckthorn_Hippophae_Rhamnoides_L_Oil_as_Depot_Formulation)].

In human clinical trials, sea buckthorn has generally been well tolerated. Studies involving the consumption of sea buckthorn juice, berries, or oil for periods ranging from 4 to 12 weeks in healthy adults showed no significant adverse effects, with no notable changes in blood markers for liver or renal function [[5](https://consensus.app/search/what-are-the-adverse-effects-of-sea-buckthorn/hsCpvw5cTf29N9C2Qt9oEg/)]. A long-term study in postmenopausal women taking 3 grams of oil daily for three months reported that about 10% of participants experienced gastrointestinal symptoms [[12](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-89947)]. While generally safe, one of the most commonly reported cosmetic side effects is carotenodermia—a benign, generalized yellow discoloration of the skin—resulting from the high carotenoid content, particularly at high dietary doses [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [17](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-765/sea-buckthorn)]. This condition is non-toxic and typically resolves upon discontinuation of the supplement [[17](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-765/sea-buckthorn)]. There are currently no well-documented contraindications, but caution is advised during pregnancy and lactation due to insufficient reliable safety data [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [14](https://www.healthspan.co.uk/guides/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-oil-and-omega-7/?srsltid=AfmBOorndFjawr_z24Drb0bzSs789wVIh636rplTUyWHiLrS-gOVfo8W), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)].

Despite the overall positive safety profile, clinicians should be aware of potential risks, particularly concerning drug interactions. Sea buckthorn's ability to inhibit platelet aggregation raises concerns for increased bleeding risk, especially in individuals with bleeding disorders or before surgery [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. It is therefore recommended to discontinue use at least two weeks prior to any scheduled surgical procedure [[15](https://draxe.com/nutrition/sea-buckthorn-oil/), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. Additionally, because it can lower blood pressure, caution is warranted in individuals with hypotension or those already taking antihypertensive medications, as it could lead to dangerously low blood pressure [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. The potential for hypoglycemia exists when co-administered with antidiabetic drugs, requiring close monitoring of blood glucose levels [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [12](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-89947)]. Finally, while rare, allergic reactions may occur, particularly in individuals sensitive to the Elaeagnaceae plant family [[11](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-sea-buckthorn)].

## Drug Interactions & Contraindications

Clinicians must exercise caution when considering sea buckthorn supplementation for patients who are concurrently taking prescription medications, as clinically significant interactions have been identified. The primary areas of concern are its effects on blood clotting, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. Sea buckthorn contains bioactive compounds, particularly flavonoids and fatty acids, that interfere with platelet function. Preclinical and some human studies have demonstrated its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [19](https://www.peacehealth.org/medical-topics/id/hn-10010065)]. This property underpins its potential for cardiovascular protection but also creates a risk of additive effects when combined with anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. Consequently, concurrent use with medications such as warfarin, heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel, ibuprofen, and naproxen could increase the risk of bruising and bleeding [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm), [66](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395777122_Sea_buckthorn_bioactive_metabolites_and_their_pharmacological_potential_in_digestive_diseases)]. Patients should be counseled to avoid sea buckthorn supplements before surgery due to this risk [[15](https://draxe.com/nutrition/sea-buckthorn-oil/), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)].

Another critical interaction involves antihypertensive medications. Clinical evidence indicates that sea buckthorn can lower blood pressure, particularly in hypertensive individuals [[40](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27522605/), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11527678/)]. When combined with antihypertensive drugs like ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enalapril), calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, amlodipine), or diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide), it may lead to an additive hypotensive effect, potentially causing dangerously low blood pressure [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential for patients taking these medications alongside sea buckthorn [[18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)]. Similarly, its demonstrated ability to enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion and improve insulin sensitivity raises concerns for interactions with antidiabetic medications [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10217465/)]. Co-administration with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin could potentiate their effects, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [12](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-89947)]. Blood glucose levels must be monitored carefully in diabetic patients using sea buckthorn [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296)].

While direct interactions with cyclosporine are mentioned as possible, the evidence is less clear [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296)]. Other potential interactions are noted, including possible effects on iron metabolism, as one study in hemodialysis patients found that sea buckthorn oil supplementation led to an increase in plasma phosphate and sodium levels while decreasing plasma iron levels [[116](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131570/)]. This finding highlights the need for vigilance in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances. Given the lack of comprehensive human data on all potential drug interactions, the general principle for clinicians is to maintain a high index of suspicion and recommend that patients disclose all herbal and dietary supplement use. Due to insufficient reliable information on its safety, avoidance of sea buckthorn during pregnancy and lactation is strongly advised [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [14](https://www.healthspan.co.uk/guides/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-oil-and-omega-7/?srsltid=AfmBOorndFjawr_z24Drb0bzSs789wVIh636rplTUyWHiLrS-gOVfo8W), [18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm)].

## Quality Control & Adulteration Risks

Ensuring the quality and authenticity of sea buckthorn products is a significant challenge for consumers and clinicians alike. The market is fraught with variability in potency and potential adulteration, largely due to the difficulty in distinguishing between seed oil and pulp oil, which have vastly different bioactive compositions and intended uses [[69](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090022_Use_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Oil_in_the_Treatment_of_Skin_Disease_Anti-Inflammatory_Benefits_Clinical_Applications_and_Formulary_Challenges)]. A critical issue is that commercial labeling often misrepresents the type of oil contained within a product, making it difficult for practitioners to recommend the correct formulation for a specific indication [[69](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090022_Use_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Oil_in_the_Treatment_of_Skin_Disease_Anti-Inflammatory_Benefits_Clinical_Applications_and_Formulary_Challenges)]. Analytical studies using techniques like gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have revealed widespread inconsistencies in commercially available products [[92](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299394119_Quality_and_authenticity_of_seabuckthorn_oils_using_succesive_UV-Vis_FT-_IR_NMR_spectroscopy_and_HPLC-_GC-chromatography_fingerprints)]. For example, one study found that only one out of six samples labeled as "sea buckthorn oil" was actual fruit oil; the others were seed oil or mixed oils [[69](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090022_Use_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Oil_in_the_Treatment_of_Skin_Disease_Anti-Inflammatory_Benefits_Clinical_Applications_and_Formulary_Challenges)]. This underscores the necessity of third-party testing and verification of product labels.

Standardization of sea buckthorn products is complicated by the fact that its benefits arise from a complex synergy of multiple compounds rather than a single marker. However, certain components serve as useful indicators of quality and origin. Fatty acid profiles are a key fingerprint; pulp oil is characterized by a high percentage of palmitoleic acid (omega-7), whereas seed oil is defined by its high content of linoleic (omega-6) and α-linolenic (omega-3) acids [[16](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-019-1065-9), [86](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034099&utm_source=chatgpt.com)]. Carotenoids, particularly β-carotene, are also abundant in pulp oil and can be used as a marker for its quality [[87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_buckthorn_oil), [90](https://naturalingredient.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/0fcfd511125106674c000000.pdf)]. Phytosterols, especially β-sitosterol, are present in high concentrations in seed oil and can be used to verify its identity [[25](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/10/1985), [90](https://naturalingredient.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/0fcfd511125106674c000000.pdf)]. The extraction method itself profoundly impacts the final product's quality. Cold-pressed extraction and supercritical CO₂ fluid extraction are superior methods as they preserve heat-sensitive bioactive compounds like tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids, whereas solvent extraction or high-temperature screw pressing can degrade these valuable nutrients [[84](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224425000809), [90](https://naturalingredient.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/0fcfd511125106674c000000.pdf)]. The Mongolian Bureau of Technical Standards has developed a draft standard (MNS 0783:2024) specifically for edible sea buckthorn oil, aiming to address these quality issues by setting requirements for production, inspection, packaging, and labeling [[126](https://managementsystems.world/news-article/mongolia-seeks-public-comments-on-draft-sea-buckthorn-oil-standard), [127](https://foodcomplianceinternational.com/industry-insight/news/5067-new-standard-on-edible-sea-buckthorn-oil)].

To mitigate risks, clinicians and consumers should look for products that provide transparency regarding their source, extraction method, and analytical testing. Certifications from reputable third-party organizations like USP, ConsumerLab, or NSF can provide an additional layer of assurance [[12](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-89947)]. For research purposes, it is critical to specify the exact botanical part, extraction method, and, where possible, the concentration of key marker compounds (e.g., palmitoleic acid, β-sitosterol, total flavonoids) in any sea buckthorn preparation used in clinical trials to ensure comparability and reproducibility of results [[123](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814624037890)]. Without such standardization, the true efficacy and safety of sea buckthorn preparations remain difficult to ascertain, limiting its integration into evidence-based practice.

## Comparative Analysis & Clinical Decision Rules

When evaluating sea buckthorn, it is essential to place its clinical effects in the context of established standards of care. For certain indications, it offers a compelling adjunctive or alternative therapy, while for others, its role remains investigational. A comparative analysis reveals its position as a nutraceutical intervention rather than a first-line pharmaceutical agent. For instance, in the management of **hyperlipidemia**, sea buckthorn seed oil acts as a supportive therapy. While meta-analyses show it can significantly lower total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C in individuals with dyslipidemia, its effects are modest compared to statins [[42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224416300322), [71](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36043374/)]. Its primary advantage lies in its favorable safety profile and potential for synergistic effects when combined with lifestyle modifications. Unlike statins, which work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, sea buckthorn's mechanism is multifactorial, involving modulation of AMPK/SIRT1 pathways and gut microbiota [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full), [93](https://farmaciajournal.com/arhiva/201404/art-14-Popescu%20743-752.pdf)]. For **hypertension**, the evidence for sea buckthorn is promising but less robust than for lipids. One study suggested its effects were comparable to calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, but weaker for systolic blood pressure [[7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2024.1477636/full)]. This positions it as a potential complementary option for patients seeking to manage mild to moderate hypertension through natural means, but it should not replace conventional antihypertensive medications without medical supervision.

In gynecology, sea buckthorn presents a novel, non-hormonal approach to managing **vulvovaginal atrophy**. Clinical trials have demonstrated that a topical vaginal gel containing sea buckthorn oil can significantly improve vaginal epithelial integrity and alleviate symptoms like dryness, itching, and burning in postmenopausal women [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10662087/), [14](https://www.healthspan.co.uk/guides/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-oil-and-omega-7/?srsltid=AfmBOorndFjawr_z24Drb0bzSs789wVIh636rplTUyWHiLrS-gOVfo8W), [52](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1244300/full)]. Crucially, studies have shown this effect is independent of estrogenic pathways, making it a valuable alternative for women who cannot or prefer not to use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6589177/), [69](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387090022_Use_of_Sea_Buckthorn_Oil_in_the_Treatment_of_Skin_Disease_Anti-Inflammatory_Benefits_Clinical_Applications_and_Formulary_Challenges)]. Compared to HRT, sea buckthorn avoids the potential systemic risks associated with estrogen, although its long-term efficacy and safety profile require further investigation. For **atopic dermatitis**, oral sea buckthorn pulp oil has shown efficacy comparable to placebo in some studies, but a direct comparison to standard therapies like topical corticosteroids is not available in the provided literature [[9](https://www.drugs.com/npp/sea-buckthorn.html), [19](https://www.peacehealth.org/medical-topics/id/hn-10010065)]. Its mechanism, likely involving systemic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, contrasts with the local action of topical steroids, suggesting a different mode of therapeutic action [[68](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-020-02997-2), [70](https://karger.com/spp/article/30/5/268/295865/Sea-Buckthorn-Hippophae-rhamnoides-L-Oil-Improves)].

**IF** a patient with established **hyperlipidemia** is looking to support their lipid management program, **THEN** suggest adding sea buckthorn seed oil at a dose of 0.75 mL daily **BECAUSE** meta-analyses confirm its ability to further reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in this population [[40](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27522605/), [42](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224416300322)].

**IF** a patient with diagnosed **dry eye syndrome** experiences persistent symptoms despite standard treatments, **THEN** consider recommending oral sea buckthorn oil at a dose of 2 grams daily **BECAUSE** it has been proven to attenuate tear film osmolarity and reduce subjective symptoms of redness and burning [[31](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20554904/), [36](https://www.herbalgram.org/resources/herbclip/issues/2010/bin_409/091061-406/)].

**IF** a patient with **hypertension** is being managed with medication and is interested in natural adjuncts, **THEN** cautiously consider advising sea buckthorn seed oil at 0.75 mL daily **BECAUSE** of its demonstrated blood pressure-lowering effects, but this must be done in conjunction with careful monitoring of blood pressure to prevent hypotension [[18](https://www.rxlist.com/supplements/sea_buckthorn.htm), [40](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27522605/)].

## Research Frontiers & Future Directions

While sea buckthorn has a substantial body of evidence supporting its use in several clinical areas, numerous research frontiers remain open, presenting opportunities for future investigation that could expand its therapeutic utility. One of the most promising areas is the development and study of **fermented sea buckthorn products**. Fermentation with probiotic strains like *Lactobacillus plantarum* and *Pediococcus acidilactici* has been shown to significantly enhance the antioxidant potential and total flavonoid content of sea buckthorn juice [[133](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9895381/), [136](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Antioxidant-activity-of-fermented-and-non-fermented-sea-buckthorn-juice-A-DPPH_fig1_362698556)]. This process may generate new bioactive metabolites and improve the bioavailability of existing compounds, potentially leading to enhanced efficacy. Preclinical studies on fermented sea buckthorn compound juice have demonstrated promising results in inhibiting colon cancer growth and modulating the immune system in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting a potential role in oncology prevention and therapy [[43](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464624004109)]. Further clinical trials are needed to validate these findings and explore the potential of fermented sea buckthorn as a next-generation functional beverage or nutraceutical.

Another critical frontier is the optimization of sea buckthorn's delivery systems to overcome its inherent limitations, particularly the low oral bioavailability of its key flavonoid compounds [[55](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33856060/), [57](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfbc.13724)]. Advanced formulation technologies such as nanoemulsions, phospholipid complexes, and solid dispersions have shown promise in preclinical studies for significantly enhancing the solubility, permeability, and overall bioavailability of sea buckthorn flavonoids [[57](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfbc.13724), [58](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350900591_Flavonoids_from_sea_buckthorn_A_review_on_phytochemistry_pharmacokinetics_and_role_in_metabolic_diseases)]. For example, nanosuspensions have been shown to increase the bioavailability of isorhamnetin and quercetin by over 4-fold in animal models [[58](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350900591_Flavonoids_from_sea_buckthorn_A_review_on_phytochemistry_pharmacokinetics_and_role_in_metabolic_diseases)]. Developing and clinically validating such advanced delivery systems could unlock the full therapeutic potential of sea buckthorn's flavonoids, allowing for lower doses and more predictable clinical outcomes. Additionally, microencapsulation techniques are being explored to improve the stability of sea buckthorn oil, preventing oxidation and extending its shelf life in food and cosmetic products [[84](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224425000809), [92](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299394119_Quality_and_authenticity_of_seabuckthorn_oils_using_succesive_UV-Vis_FT-_IR_NMR_spectroscopy_and_HPLC-_GC-chromatography_fingerprints)].

Furthermore, there is a pressing need for larger, longer-term, multi-center randomized controlled trials to clarify the effects of sea buckthorn on several key areas where evidence is currently limited. Robust clinical data is required to confirm its efficacy in **gastrointestinal conditions** like *H. pylori*-associated gastritis and inflammatory bowel disease, moving beyond the current strong preclinical support [[51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12500570/), [65](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944501325000898)]. Similarly, while preliminary data suggests benefits for **metabolic syndrome** and **type 2 diabetes**, large-scale trials are necessary to establish its role as a supportive therapy for glycemic control [[12](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-89947), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11527678/)]. Perhaps the most significant gap is the lack of human clinical trials investigating its **anti-cancer properties**. Despite a wealth of compelling preclinical evidence demonstrating its ability to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in various cancer cell lines, these findings have not yet been translated to human patients [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949866X23001296), [12](https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-benefits-of-sea-buckthorn-89947), [23](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sea-buckthorn-oil)]. Future research should focus on designing well-controlled trials to evaluate sea buckthorn as an adjunctive therapy in oncology, potentially to reduce chemotherapy toxicity or slow tumor progression. Addressing these research gaps will be essential for fully integrating sea buckthorn into mainstream evidence-based medicine.
