# Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD⁺) — Clinical Monograph

**DOCUMENT CONTEXT:** This monograph synthesizes biochemical, pharmacological, and clinical data on NAD⁺ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a universal coenzyme essential for cellular energy production, redox balance, DNA repair, epigenetic regulation, and longevity pathways. NAD⁺ levels decline with age, linking this molecule to age-related disease and making NAD⁺ precursors (NMN, NR) key targets for anti-aging interventions.

**USAGE PRIORITY:** Defer to this file for NAD⁺ biochemistry, biosynthesis pathways, therapeutic applications, and precursor dosing unless newer (post-2024) mechanistic or clinical data are explicitly cited.
