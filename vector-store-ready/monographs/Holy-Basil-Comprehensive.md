# 8. CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT FRAMEWORK

## 8.1 Clinical Decision Rules (IF/THEN/BECAUSE)

**Rule 1: Stress and Sleep Disturbance**

**IF** a patient presents with subclinical anxiety, poor sleep quality, elevated perceived stress, and no psychiatric contraindications,

**THEN** recommend a standardized Holy Basil extract (e.g., 250 mg/day Holixer™ or equivalent) for 8 weeks,

**BECAUSE** high-quality RCT evidence demonstrates:
- 37% reduction in perceived stress (vs 19% placebo, p=0.003)
- 48% reduction in insomnia severity (vs 27% placebo, p=0.025)
- Objective reduction in hair cortisol (chronic stress biomarker)
- Blunted acute stress response (cortisol, amylase, blood pressure)

**Rule 2: Type 2 Diabetes (Adjunctive)**

**IF** a patient with type 2 diabetes is not meeting glycemic targets with diet/exercise and first-line medications (metformin),

**THEN** consider adding Holy Basil (2.5-3 g/day leaf powder or 250-500 mg/day extract) as adjunctive therapy with close physician oversight,

**BECAUSE** multiple RCTs demonstrate:
- Fasting glucose reduction: 21 mg/dL (17.6% decrease)
- Postprandial glucose reduction: 15.8 mg/dL (7.3% decrease)
- HbA1c improvement
- Lipid profile improvement (total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides)

**CRITICAL:** Blood glucose must be monitored daily initially; antidiabetic medication doses may need reduction to prevent hypoglycemia.

**Rule 3: Oral Health (Gingivitis/Plaque)**

**IF** a patient requires management of mild-moderate plaque and gingivitis, or cannot tolerate chlorhexidine (staining, taste, alcohol),

**THEN** recommend Holy Basil mouthwash (10-15 mL twice daily, swish 30-60 seconds after brushing),

**BECAUSE** multiple RCTs demonstrate:
- Equivalent efficacy to 0.12% chlorhexidine (gold standard)
- Significant reduction in gingival index and plaque index
- Superior tolerability (no staining, better taste)
- Antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens

**Rule 4: Pregnancy**

**IF** a patient is pregnant, planning pregnancy, or breastfeeding,

**THEN** strongly advise against Holy Basil use,

**BECAUSE** animal studies demonstrate:
- Impaired embryo implantation
- Risk of miscarriage
- Unknown safety in lactation

**Rule 5: Anticoagulant Therapy**

**IF** a patient is taking warfarin, heparin, or antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel, aspirin),

**THEN** advise against Holy Basil use (or use only with close INR/bleeding time monitoring),

**BECAUSE** Holy Basil has anticoagulant properties that can:
- Increase bleeding time
- Increase bruising risk
- Increase serious bleeding risk (GI bleed, intracranial hemorrhage)

**Rule 6: Preoperative Period**

**IF** a patient is scheduled for elective surgery within 2 weeks,

**THEN** instruct patient to discontinue all Holy Basil supplements immediately,

**BECAUSE** anticoagulant properties increase risk of:
- Intraoperative bleeding
- Postoperative hemorrhage

**Rule 7: Immune Support**

**IF** a patient has recurrent upper respiratory infections or seeks immune support during high-stress periods,

**THEN** consider Holy Basil (300-600 mg/day standardized extract) for 4-8 weeks,

**BECAUSE** double-blind RCT demonstrates:
- Increased CD4+ T-cell count
- Enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity
- Elevated serum lysozyme (antimicrobial enzyme)
- Increased salivary IgA (mucosal immunity)
