## Main Topic

Fluoride (F⁻) is the ionic form of fluorine and occurs naturally in food and drinking water. It is primarily used in public health to prevent dental caries (tooth decay) and is available in water fluoridation programs, dental products and some supplements. At appropriate intakes, fluoride enhances enamel resistance to acid and reduces caries; excessive intake can cause dental or skeletal fluorosis.

## Mechanism of Action

- **Dental caries prevention**:
  - Promotes **remineralization** of demineralized enamel and inhibits demineralization by forming **fluoroapatite**, a more acid-resistant mineral.  
  - Inhibits bacterial metabolism and acid production in dental plaque, reducing cariogenic potential.

- **Bone effects**:
  - Stimulates osteoblast activity and bone formation at higher doses, but doses that meaningfully increase BMD often cause skeletal fluorosis; fluoride is **not routinely used** to treat osteoporosis.

---

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**:
  - ≈80% or more of ingested fluoride is absorbed from the GI tract.  
  - Swallowed toothpaste fluoride is also readily absorbed.

- **Distribution**:
  - Adults retain ~50% of absorbed fluoride, mostly in bones and teeth.  
  - Young children may retain up to ~80% due to active mineralization of growing bones and teeth.

- **Excretion**:
  - Remaining fluoride is excreted mainly via **urine**.  
  - Measurable in plasma, saliva, nails, hair and bones, but there are **no established individual clinical markers** of deficiency or excess.

## Recommended Intakes

The Food and Nutrition Board set **Adequate Intakes (AIs)** for fluoride to maximize caries reduction while minimizing fluorosis.

### Adequate Intakes (AIs)

| Age & physiological status | AI (mg/day)                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Birth–6 months**         | 0.01 (M & F)                       |
| **7–12 months**            | 0.5 (M & F)                        |
| **1–3 yr**                 | 0.7 (M & F)                        |
| **4–8 yr**                 | 1.0 (M & F)                        |
| **9–13 yr**                | 2.0 (M & F)                        |
| **14–18 yr**               | 3.0 (M & F; pregnancy/lactation)   |
| **≥19 yr**                 | 4.0 (men); 3.0 (women, pregnancy, lactation) |

### Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs)

To avoid dental and skeletal fluorosis:

- **Birth–6 months**: 0.7 mg/day  
- **7–12 months**: 0.9 mg/day  
- **1–3 yr**: 1.3 mg/day  
- **4–8 yr**: 2.2 mg/day  
- **≥9 yr (incl. pregnancy/lactation)**: **10 mg/day**  

ULs apply to total intake from **water, food, supplements and dental products**.

## Sources of Fluoride

### Drinking Water

- **Fluoridated municipal water**:
  - Primary source in many countries (~60% of U.S. fluoride intake).  
  - Since 2015, U.S. PHS recommends **0.7 mg/L** fluoride to balance caries prevention and fluorosis risk.  
  - EPA sets MCL at 4.0 mg/L and secondary standard at 2.0 mg/L to prevent fluorosis.  
  - ~63% of Americans have access to fluoridated water.

- **Bottled water**:
  - Rarely fluoridated; when fluoridated, FDA limits total fluoride to ≤0.7 mg/L.

### Food and Beverages

- Most foods contain only **trace fluoride**, with variability due to water used in preparation.  
- Tea plants accumulate fluoride; **brewed tea** often contains ~0.07–1.5 mg per cup.  
- Fluoride in cow’s milk and breast milk is very low (<0.01 mg/L).  
- Certain foods (e.g., canned shrimp, raisins) contribute small amounts.

### Dietary Supplements

- Some multivitamin–mineral products supply 0.25–1.0 mg fluoride per serving, especially for children in low-fluoride areas.

### Dental Products

- Most toothpastes contain ~1,000–1,100 mg/L fluoride (≈1.3 mg fluoride per ¼‑teaspoon).  
- Typical swallowed amount: ≈0.1–0.25 mg/day in young children; ~0.1 mg/day in adults.  
- Other products: fluoride mouth rinses, professional gels/varnishes, and fluoride-containing dental materials.

### Medications

- Fluoride is a structural component of some drugs (e.g., voriconazole); prolonged voriconazole use can increase serum fluoride and cause skeletal periostitis/fluorosis, warranting discontinuation if this develops.

## Clinical Evidence

### Dental Caries Prevention

- **Community water fluoridation**:
  - Cochrane review (20 mostly pre‑1975 studies) found:  
    - ~35% fewer decayed, missing and filled baby teeth and ~26% fewer permanent tooth lesions in children with fluoridated water.  
    - ~15% higher prevalence of caries-free children.  
  - NHANES cross-sectional analysis (~19,600 participants) showed:  
    - Children in counties where ≥75% of the population had ≥0.7 mg/L fluoride in water had ~30% fewer caries in primary teeth and ~12% fewer in permanent teeth.  
  - Australian adult data: long-term exposure to fluoridated water associated with 11–24% fewer decayed, missing or filled teeth.

- **Fluoride supplements**:
  - Cochrane and other reviews: daily supplements (0.25–1 mg/day) reduce caries in children without fluoridated water.  
  - Ranges reported:
    - ~24% reduction in decayed/missing/filled surfaces.  
    - 48–72% reduction in primary-tooth caries and 33–80% reduction when used for 6–10 years.

  - **Guidelines**:
    - **USPSTF**: prescribe fluoride supplements to children ≥6 months in areas with low-fluoride water.  
    - **ADA** (when water fluoride <0.3 mg/L unless otherwise specified):  
      - 6 mo–3 yr: 0.25 mg/day.  
      - 3–6 yr: 0.5 mg/day (<0.3 mg/L) or 0.25 mg/day (0.3–0.6 mg/L).  
      - 6–16 yr: 1.0 mg/day (<0.3 mg/L) or 0.5 mg/day (0.3–0.6 mg/L).

- **Prenatal supplementation**:
  - Limited trials (e.g., 1 mg/day in late pregnancy) show **no reduction** in caries among offspring; prenatal fluoride supplementation is **not recommended** for caries prevention.

### Bone Health

- Observational studies generally find **no major differences** in BMD or fracture risk between fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities at ~1 mg/L.  
- Some data suggest lower fracture risk at ~1 mg/L in certain populations, but findings are inconsistent.  
- Meta-analysis of RCTs:
  - ≤20 mg/day fluoride showed some fracture reduction; higher doses lost benefit and increased adverse effects.  
  - Later RCTs with 2.5–10 mg/day in post-menopausal women showed no meaningful BMD changes.

Overall, fluoride is **not recommended as a systemic therapy** for osteoporosis due to limited benefit and toxicity concerns.

## Safety and Toxicity

### Dental Fluorosis

- Results from chronic excess fluoride intake during **tooth development**.  
- Presents as white flecks/spots; severe cases show enamel pitting and discoloration.  
- NHANES 1999–2004: ≈20.8% of 6–49‑yr-olds had very mild/mild fluorosis; moderate/severe <1%.  
- Recent data: ≈two-thirds of children/adolescents have some fluorosis, mostly very mild; often fades with age and is primarily cosmetic.  
- Water fluoridation at 0.7 mg/L has **not** been linked to severe fluorosis.

### Skeletal Fluorosis & Systemic Effects

- Occurs with prolonged high intake (often >10 mg/day for many years), typically from high-fluoride water or occupational exposure.  
- Symptoms:  
  - Joint pain and stiffness, osteosclerosis.  
  - In severe cases, limited joint mobility, deformity, and neurologic effects from spinal cord compression.  
- Extremely rare in countries fluoridating water at recommended levels.

### Acute Toxicity

- Acute toxic dose ≈5 mg/kg body weight; causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  
- Such doses are virtually unattainable from fluoridated water or normal toothpaste use.

### Neurodevelopmental Concerns

- Some observational studies (mainly at fluoride levels >1.5 mg/L) report associations with lower IQ or behavioral outcomes; many are methodologically limited.  
- Meta-analysis (2023) found **no association** between fluoride exposure at U.S. fluoridation levels (~0.7 mg/L) and child IQ.  
- 2024 NTP review: levels above ~1.5 mg/L may be associated with lower IQ; this **does not apply** to U.S. fluoridation levels.

## Special Populations

- **Infants/young children**:
  - Formula reconstituted with fluoridated water may approach UL; using low-fluoride water can reduce exposure.  
  - Toothpaste:
    - <3 years: rice‑grain–sized amount.  
    - ≥3 years: pea-sized amount; supervise brushing to limit swallowing.

- **Pregnancy**:
  - Fluoride crosses the placenta; routine supplemental fluoride in pregnancy is **not recommended** due to lack of proven benefit and unresolved neurodevelopmental concerns at high exposures.

- **Renal impairment**:
  - Fluoride is renally excreted; severe CKD may lead to accumulation.  
  - Avoid fluoride supplements and minimize high-fluoride sources in these patients.

- **Voriconazole**:
  - Long-term use can raise fluoride levels → bone pain, periostitis and skeletal fluorosis; discontinue if such effects appear.

---

## Interactions

- No consistent, clinically important drug–drug interactions identified at usual preventive doses.  
- High doses of calcium or aluminum antacids can reduce fluoride absorption, but this is rarely clinically significant in practice.

---

## Practical Guidelines for Clinicians

1. **Assess fluoride exposure**:
   - Consider drinking water source (public vs well vs bottled), fluoride content, dental products, supplements, diet (tea, seafood) and medications.  
   - Local water utilities or tools like *My Water’s Fluoride* can provide community fluoride concentrations.

2. **Support community water fluoridation**:
   - Strong evidence supports ~0.7 mg/L water fluoridation for reducing dental caries at the population level with acceptable safety.

3. **Use supplements selectively**:
   - Reserve dietary fluoride supplements for children ≥6 months in communities with low-fluoride water, following ADA/USPSTF dosing and monitoring total intake against ULs.

4. **Optimize dental product use**:
   - Recommend twice‑daily brushing with fluoridated toothpaste for all ages, adjusting amount for children and supervising young children to prevent swallowing.

5. **Monitor and manage fluorosis risk**:
   - In children showing fluorosis or with high estimated intake, reduce non-essential fluoride sources (e.g., swallowed toothpaste, unnecessary supplements, high-fluoride water).

6. **Avoid therapeutic high-dose fluoride for bone disease**:
   - Do not use systemic fluoride as an osteoporosis treatment given limited efficacy and risk of skeletal fluorosis.

## Conclusion

Fluoride’s primary clinical value lies in **prevention of dental caries**. Adequate intake through fluoridated water, fluoride toothpaste and normal diet is sufficient for most individuals. Fluoride supplementation is appropriate only for children in low-fluoride areas and should be carefully dosed to avoid fluorosis. At the recommended community water level (~0.7 mg/L), fluoridation is a safe, cost-effective public-health measure; high-dose systemic use for bone disease is not recommended. Careful assessment of total fluoride exposure and individualized guidance help maximize oral-health benefits while minimizing risk.
