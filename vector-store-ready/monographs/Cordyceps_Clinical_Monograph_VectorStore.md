## Main Topic

*Cordyceps sinensis* (often now classified as *Ophiocordyceps sinensis*) and *Cordyceps militaris* are parasitic fungi traditionally used in Chinese and Tibetan medicine for fatigue, respiratory disorders, sexual dysfunction and kidney disease. Wild *C. sinensis* (“winter-worm summer-grass”) is rare and expensive; most modern clinical research uses **cultivated mycelial products** (e.g., Cs-4, Bailing capsule, Jinshuibao) or **cultivated *C. militaris*** extracts, which have distinct chemical profiles and clinical indications.

---

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Key preparations**:
  - **Wild *C. sinensis*** (fruiting bodies; adenosine, D-mannitol; limited modern trials).  
  - **Cultivated *C. sinensis* mycelia** (e.g., Cs-4/CordyMax, Bailing, Jinshuibao; adenosine, mannitol, polysaccharides).  
  - **Cultivated *C. militaris*** (high cordycepin, adenosine, polysaccharides; strong immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory signals).
- **Core mechanisms**:
  - Polysaccharides (β-glucans, galactoglucomannans) activating macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells via **TLR4, NF‑κB, MAPK** pathways.  
  - Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) inhibiting mRNA polyadenylation, downregulating **TLR4/NF‑κB** and **NLRP3 inflammasome**, and activating **AMPK**; anti-inflammatory, metabolic and neuroprotective effects.  
  - Additional contributions from adenosine, ergosterol/other sterols, D‑mannitol and peptides.
- **Best-supported indications** (human data):
  - **CKD & nephroprotection**: Bailing capsule and *C. militaris* RCTs show significant reductions in BUN, creatinine, proteinuria, and improved eGFR.  
  - **Exercise performance**: Cs-4 and powders (2–3 g/day) improve VO₂peak, ventilatory thresholds and time to exhaustion, especially in older or untrained adults.  
  - **Immune modulation / respiratory health**: *C. militaris* beverages and *C. sinensis* extracts enhance NK activity and modulate cytokines; Corbin and Bailing capsules improve asthma/bronchitis symptoms and exacerbation rates.  
  - **Metabolic health**: Cs-4 (3 g/day) improves HDL, apoA1 and oxidized LDL in low-HDL subjects; preclinical data support glucose benefits.  
  - **Sleep / post-viral symptoms**: *C. sinensis* fermentation broth improves PSQI scores in primary insomnia; Cs-4 shows benefit for long COVID symptom burden.  
  - **Oncology support**: As an adjunct to chemo/radiotherapy, *C. sinensis* formulations improve tumor response, quality of life and treatment tolerability.
- **Safety and cautions**:
  - Generally well-tolerated in trials; mild GI upset possible.  
  - Theoretical **bleeding risk** with anticoagulants/antiplatelets; **hypoglycemia risk** with antidiabetics; caution in **autoimmune disease** and **hematologic malignancies**.  
  - Use only standardized products; quality and species identity vary widely.

## Preparation Types & Bioactives

### Preparation Types

| Preparation Type | Key Bioactive Compounds | Representative Products/Studies | Primary Evidence Areas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wild *C. sinensis*** | Adenosine, D‑mannitol (cordycepic acid), polysaccharides | Bailing capsule, Corbin capsule | CKD, asthma, contrast-induced nephropathy |
| **Cultivated *C. sinensis* (mycelia)** | Adenosine, mannitol, polysaccharides, low cordycepin | Cs-4 (CordyMax), Jinshuibao | Exercise performance, metabolic markers, immune function, long COVID, insomnia |
| **Cultivated *C. militaris*** | Cordycepin, adenosine, polysaccharides, ergosterol | Fermentation broths, mycelial extracts, beverages | NK activity, URTI prophylaxis, CKD, anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective actions |

### Mechanistic Highlights

- **Polysaccharides**:
  - Activate macrophages via TLR4–NF‑κB and MAPK pathways → ↑ phagocytosis, NO, TNF‑α, IL‑6, IL‑10.  
  - Activate immature dendritic cells, upregulating CD80/CD86 and promoting Th1-polarized responses.  
  - Explain observed increases in NK activity and salivary IgA in human trials.

- **Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine)**:
  - Interferes with mRNA polyadenylation → broad transcriptional effects.  
  - Inhibits TLR4/NF‑κB signaling, reducing TNF‑α, IL‑1β, COX‑2, ICAM‑1 and systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., hs‑CRP) in CKD studies.  
  - Inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis; reduces ROS and caspase‑1 activation; supports neuroprotection in preclinical models.  
  - Activates AMPK, impacting mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis.

- **Other bioactives**:
  - **Adenosine**: Vasodilatory, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory; present in both species and likely contributes where cordycepin is low.  
  - **Sterols (ergosterol, β‑sitosterol)**: Anti-lipidemic and anti-fibrotic signals in preclinical data.  
  - **D‑mannitol (cordycepic acid)**: Osmotic and mucolytic properties, relevant to respiratory uses.  
  - **Peptides/polypeptides**: Some inhibit IL‑1β/TNF‑α and support neurocognitive performance in animal models.

## Human Clinical Evidence (by Indication)

### Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) & Nephroprotection

- **Bailing capsule (*C. sinensis* mycelia)**:
  - Meta-analysis of 31 RCTs (n≈2,934; 8–24 weeks) showed significant reductions in:  
    - BUN: SMD ≈ −0.98 (p<0.00001).  
    - Serum creatinine: SMD ≈ −1.30 (p<0.00001).  
    - 24h urinary protein: SMD ≈ −1.08 (p<0.00001).  
  - Interpreted as clinically meaningful nephroprotective effect in CKD when used adjunctively.

- ***C. militaris* in stage 3–4 CKD**:
  - RCT (100 mg/day for 3 months) in stage 3–4 CKD showed:  
    - Urinary protein ↓ 36.7%.  
    - BUN ↓ 12.5%.  
    - Serum creatinine ↓ 18.3% (all P<0.05).  
    - Improved eGFR and redox status (↓ cystatin‑C, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde; ↑ NO, SOD).  
    - Renal histology: reduced inflammatory infiltration and preserved filtration membrane.  
  - Downregulation of TLR4/NF‑κB pathway in human kidney tissue linked to these effects.

- **Contrast-associated AKI (CA‑AKI)**:
  - Fermented *O. sinensis* mycelial products (FOSM) reduced CA‑AKI incidence when used prophylactically before contrast procedures in clinical studies.

### Exercise Performance

- **Meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (n=288)**:
  - *C. sinensis* 2–3 g/day for 2–12 weeks improved:  
    - Endurance performance;  
    - Ventilatory threshold (p=0.03);  
    - VO₂peak (p=0.04).

- **Cs-4 in elderly adults**:
  - 12 weeks of Cs-4 333 mg TID (≈1 g/day) increased metabolic threshold (~10.5%) and ventilatory threshold (~8.5%) vs placebo.  
  - Another RCT using 3 g/day Cs-4 for 6 weeks in older adults increased VO₂max (from ~1.88 to 2.00 L/min, P≈0.050) and anaerobic threshold.

- **Athletes**:
  - Long-distance runners: 3 g/day *C. sinensis* powder for 2 weeks increased time to exhaustion, ventilatory threshold (VT2) and VO₂max vs placebo.  
  - Lower doses (e.g., 1 g/day) or very short duration (≈1 week) often showed no effect, suggesting a threshold dose/duration is needed.

### Immune Modulation & Respiratory Health

- **NK cell activity — *C. militaris* beverage**:
  - RCT with a functional beverage from fermented *C. militaris* (≥2.85 mg cordycepin per 75 mL) for 8 weeks:  
    - Men: NK activity significantly increased by week 4 (p≈0.049).  
    - Women: significant increase by week 8 (p≈0.023).  
    - Reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL‑1β in men, IL‑6 in women).

- **NK cell activity — *C. sinensis* extract (CBG‑CS‑2)**:
  - 8-week RCT: *C. sinensis* mycelium culture extract increased NK cytotoxic activity by 38.8% vs a 35.5% decrease in placebo (P≈0.019).

- **Asthma (Corbin capsule) & chronic bronchitis (Bailing)**:
  - Corbin capsule (*C. sinensis*-containing) improved asthma quality of life scores, lung function and reduced serum IgE, ICAM‑1, IL‑4, and MMP‑9.  
  - Bailing capsule reduced acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis and improved symptoms such as expectoration and wheezing.

### Sleep & Neurocognitive Symptoms

- **Primary insomnia — FBCS (*C. sinensis* fermentation broth)**:
  - 28-day RCT: 150 mL/day FBCS significantly reduced PSQI total score vs placebo, with improvements across all subcomponents (p<0.01).

- **Long COVID**:
  - RCT of Cs-4 (≈1.6 g/day) for 12 weeks in patients with long COVID:  
    - Significant reduction in overall symptom severity (e.g., modified C19-YRSm) with MD around −8.7 points (p<0.001).  
    - Improvements in fatigue and insomnia scores.

- **Neuroprotection (preclinical > clinical)**:
  - Preclinical models suggest robust neuroprotective effects (NLRP3 inhibition, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic actions), but human evidence for dementia or Parkinson’s is currently limited to small, early-stage trials.

### Metabolic Health

- **Low HDL & dyslipidemia**:
  - 8-week RCT in low-HDL subjects: CordyMax (Cs-4, 3 g/day) produced:  
    - HDL ↑ 19.2%.  
    - ApoA1 ↑ 34.7%.  
    - Oxidized LDL ↓ 22.9%.  
  - Similar dosing improved VO₂peak and decreased diastolic blood pressure in sedentary adults.

- **Glucose metabolism (preclinical and observational)**:
  - Animal studies: Cs-4 improves fasting glucose and glucose tolerance in diabetic rats.  
  - Clinical observations: improvement in blood sugar measurements in a high proportion of hyperglycemic patients using 3 g/day, though robust modern RCTs are limited.

### Oncology Support

- **Adjunct to chemo/radiotherapy (e.g., lung cancer)**:
  - Meta-analysis of 12 RCTs in lung cancer patients:  
    - *C. sinensis* plus chemo/radiotherapy improved tumor response rate, quality of life and immune function.  
    - Reduced adverse drug reactions compared with chemo/radiotherapy alone.  
  - In NSCLC patients on NP chemotherapy, *C. sinensis* granules prevented decline in Karnofsky performance status and reduced nausea/vomiting severity.

- **Preclinical synergy**:
  - Polysaccharides from *C. sinensis* enhance certain chemotherapeutic cytotoxicities (e.g., cisplatin) while reducing toxicity in preclinical models.  
  - Concern: hematopoietic stimulation may be undesirable in some bone marrow malignancies → avoid unsupervised use in hematologic cancers.

## Dosing & Administration (Adults)

> Doses depend strongly on preparation standardization; use products matching those studied when possible.

- **General range**:
  - Most human trials use **1–4 g/day of standardized *C. sinensis* mycelial products** (e.g., Cs-4, Bailing, CordyMax) or lower doses of concentrated *C. militaris* extracts (~100 mg/day in CKD trials).

### Example Protocols (from Trials)

- **CKD (stage 3–4)**:
  - *C. militaris* extract: **100 mg/day**, ~3 months.

- **Exercise performance (older or sedentary adults)**:
  - Cs-4/CordyMax: **2–3 g/day**, for **6–12 weeks**.

- **Low HDL / metabolic support**:
  - CordyMax: **3 g/day** for **8 weeks**.

- **Insomnia**:
  - FBCS (*C. sinensis* fermentation broth): **150 mL/day** for **28 days**.

- **Long COVID**:
  - Cs-4: **~1.6 g/day** for **12 weeks**.

---

## Safety & Adverse Effects

- **General tolerability**:
  - Clinical trials report good tolerability with doses used (1–4 g/day for *C. sinensis*, 100 mg/day for *C. militaris*), mostly mild GI symptoms when present.

- **Theoretical and observed concerns**:
  - **Bleeding risk**: Cordycepin may have antiplatelet effects; theoretical additive bleeding risk with anticoagulants/antiplatelet drugs.  
  - **Hypoglycemia**: Additive effects with insulin or oral hypoglycemics given reported glucose-lowering actions.  
  - **Autoimmune disease**: Potent immunomodulation may exacerbate autoimmunity in susceptible patients.  
  - **Hematologic malignancies**: Hematopoietic stimulation could be undesirable; avoid use without specialist guidance.

## Quality, Standardization & Adulteration

- **Standardization**:
  - Cs-4 (*C. sinensis* mycelia) is standardized to **≥0.14% adenosine** and **≥5% D‑mannitol (cordycepic acid)**.  
  - CBG‑CS‑2 (*C. sinensis* extract) has been characterized as ~32% polysaccharides, 7.3% cordycepic acid, 0.13% adenosine, and 0.001% cordycepin.  
  - *C. militaris* beverages are standardized for **cordycepin** (e.g., ≥2.85 mg per 75 mL portion) and adenosine.

- **Analytical methods**:
  - HPLC and LC-MS for adenosine, cordycepin, D‑mannitol; phenol-sulfuric acid assays for polysaccharides.  
  - DNA barcoding and sequencing are emerging tools for species verification.

- **Adulteration risks**:
  - Substitution of wild *C. sinensis* with other fungi or fillers.  
  - Mislabeling species (e.g., *C. militaris* sold as *C. sinensis*).  
  - Heavy-metal contamination (arsenic, lead) from growth substrates.

- **Practical advice**:
  - Prefer products that:
    - Clearly label species and preparation (wild vs cultivated; *C. sinensis* vs *C. militaris*).  
    - Are standardized to known marker compounds and provide certificates of analysis.  
    - Are third-party tested (e.g., NSF, USP) for identity, potency and contaminants.

## Clinical Decision Rules (From Source Monograph)

- **CKD (stage 3–4)**:
  - **IF** a stage 3–4 CKD patient on standard care is seeking to slow progression and improve renal markers,  
    **THEN** consider adding *C. militaris* 100 mg/day,  
    **BECAUSE** RCT data show significant reductions in creatinine, BUN, proteinuria and improved eGFR over 3 months.

- **Exercise performance**:
  - **IF** a middle-aged or older adult aims to improve aerobic capacity and endurance,  
    **THEN** use 2–4 g/day of standardized *C. sinensis* for ≥3 weeks,  
    **BECAUSE** multiple RCTs and a meta-analysis show improved VO₂max and ventilatory thresholds at these doses/durations.

- **Low HDL**:
  - **IF** a patient with low HDL wants a natural adjunct,  
    **THEN** consider CordyMax (Cs-4) 3 g/day for 8 weeks,  
    **BECAUSE** an RCT reported ~19% HDL and ~35% apoA1 increases and decreased oxidized LDL.

- **Contrast-induced nephropathy risk**:
  - **IF** a high-risk patient is scheduled for contrast imaging,  
    **THEN** prophylactic *C. sinensis* capsules 2–3 g TID starting 3 days before and continuing 3 days after the procedure,  
    **BECAUSE** such regimens have reduced CA‑AKI incidence in clinical studies.

- **Chemotherapy-related fatigue/quality of life**:
  - **IF** a cancer patient undergoing chemo reports severe fatigue, nausea or declining performance status,  
    **THEN** consider *C. sinensis* as an adjunct,  
    **BECAUSE** RCTs/meta-analyses show improved QOL and reduced treatment-related adverse effects.

- **Primary insomnia**:
  - **IF** a patient has primary insomnia with poor PSQI scores,  
    **THEN** trial 150 mL/day *C. sinensis* fermentation broth for 28 days,  
    **BECAUSE** an RCT demonstrated significant improvements in total and component PSQI scores.

## Research Gaps & Frontiers (Summarized)

- **Neurodegenerative diseases**:
  - Strong preclinical evidence (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, TBI models) for cordycepin-rich extracts; human RCTs are lacking.

- **Microbiome modulation**:
  - Preclinical work shows *Cordyceps* reshapes gut microbiota, increases beneficial species (e.g., *Lactobacillus*, *Akkermansia*), improves barrier function and reduces LPS-driven inflammation; clinical translation is ongoing.

- **Drug development**:
  - ProTide-modified cordycepin derivatives (e.g., NUC‑7738) are in early cancer trials, showing increased potency and promising tolerability.

## Conclusion

Cordyceps (particularly standardized *C. sinensis* mycelia and *C. militaris* extracts) is a multifaceted medicinal fungus with credible human evidence for **CKD adjunctive therapy**, **exercise performance**, **immune and respiratory modulation**, **metabolic support**, **sleep/long COVID symptom relief**, and **oncology support**. Its actions are mediated by polysaccharides, cordycepin, adenosine and related compounds acting on inflammatory, metabolic and immune pathways. Cordyceps should be used as a **complement** to, not a replacement for, standard care, with careful product selection, attention to dosing/duration, and awareness of potential interactions and theoretical risks, especially around bleeding, glycemic control, autoimmunity and hematologic cancers.
