## Main Topic

Zinc is an essential trace element involved in more than 100 enzymes and multiple structural and regulatory proteins. It is critical for immune defense, growth and development, wound healing, reproductive health, taste and smell, and normal fetal and childhood development. Total body stores are limited and cannot buffer prolonged low intake, so zinc must be consumed regularly from diet or supplements.

---

## Clinician TL;DR

- **Core roles**: Cofactor in DNA/RNA and protein synthesis, gene expression (zinc fingers), antioxidant defense, immune function, growth, reproductive health, taste/smell, and wound healing.
- **Requirements**: Adult RDA ~11 mg/day (men) and 8 mg/day (women); UL 40 mg/day (applies to total intake from food + supplements).
- **Key sources**: Highest from oysters and other shellfish; also meat, poultry, eggs, dairy; lower bioavailability from phytate-rich plant sources (legumes, nuts, whole grains).
- **Who is at risk of deficiency**: Low meat intake, high-phytate diets (vegetarian/vegan), malabsorption or chronic GI disease, chronic diarrhea, liver/kidney disease, diabetes, sickle cell disease, HIV, burns, hemodialysis, certain medications (penicillamine, thiazides, ACE inhibitors), pregnancy, lactation, preterm infants, adolescents, alcohol use disorder, and genetic disorders like acrodermatitis enteropathica.
- **Clinical uses**: Treat zinc deficiency; WHO‑recommended adjunct in childhood acute diarrhea (10–20 mg/day for 10–14 days); possible modest benefit in common cold (oral lozenges/syrup started within 24 hours); support wound healing in deficient patients.
- **Toxicity**: Usually from supplements or industrial exposure; >50 mg/day can cause GI upset, and chronic high doses (100–150 mg/day) can induce copper deficiency with anemia, neutropenia, neuropathy and hyperlipidemia; UL for adults is 40 mg/day.
- **Key interactions**: Chelation and reduced absorption of fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and penicillamine; competition with iron and copper; absorption reduced by calcium, phosphorus and phytates; thiazide diuretics increase urinary zinc loss.

## Overview

Zinc (Zn; atomic number 30) is a trace element essential for human health. It is incorporated into over 100 enzymes and supports catalytic, structural and regulatory functions—catalysing reactions in DNA and protein synthesis, cell signaling, gene expression and membrane stability. Adequate zinc is necessary for immune function (macrophages, neutrophils, NK‑cells), reproductive health, wound healing, growth, taste/smell perception and normal fetal and childhood development. Although total body zinc is ~1.5 g in women and 2.5 g in men, it cannot be stored in large quantities and must be obtained regularly through diet or supplements. Zinc homeostasis is maintained through intestinal absorption (which increases with intake but fractional absorption decreases) and biliary/intestinal excretion with reabsorption in the gut.

## Recommended Intakes & Upper Limit

The Food and Nutrition Board establishes RDAs and ULs for zinc. The Harvard Nutrition Source and NIH Office of Dietary Supplements summarize these values. Adequate intakes support full expression of zinc‑dependent enzymes and prevent deficiency. Because excess zinc impairs copper and iron absorption and may cause toxicity, the UL of 40 mg/day for adults should not be exceeded.

## Dietary Sources

Zinc is widely distributed in animal and plant foods. Bioavailability is higher from animal sources because plant phytates bind zinc and reduce absorption. Principal sources include:

- **Shellfish and seafood**: Oysters have the highest zinc content; crab, lobster and other shellfish are rich sources.
- **Meat and poultry**: Beef, pork, lamb, and poultry contribute much of the zinc intake in Western diets. Beef accounts for ~20% of zinc intake from foods in the U.S.
- **Other animal products**: Eggs and dairy.
- **Plant foods**: Legumes (beans, lentils), nuts and seeds (pumpkin, pine nuts, almonds), whole grains and fortified cereals supply zinc but with lower bioavailability due to phytates.
- **Water and miscellaneous**: Drinking water and some plant-based beverages provide small amounts.

---

## Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism & Excretion (ADME)

- **Absorption**: Occurs in the small intestine via carrier-mediated transport (ZIP4). Fractional absorption decreases as intake increases. High phytate or fiber content (in grains/legumes) and concurrent intake of iron or calcium reduce absorption.
- **Distribution**: Zinc circulates bound to albumin and α2-macroglobulin; highest concentrations are in skeletal muscle (~60%), bone (~30%) and skin, with smaller amounts in liver, kidneys and eyes.
- **Metabolism**: Zinc acts as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes (e.g., DNA/RNA polymerases, carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase), stabilizes protein structures (zinc fingers) and regulates gene expression and hormone function.
- **Excretion**: Primarily via pancreatic and biliary secretions into the gut; urinary loss is minimal under normal conditions. When deficiency develops, the body increases intestinal absorption and mobilizes zinc from bone and muscle.

---

## Physiological & Clinical Roles

- **Immune defense**: Supports development and function of neutrophils, NK cells and T- and B-lymphocytes. Even mild zinc deficiency diminishes cell-mediated and humoral immunity, increasing susceptibility to infections.
- **Growth and development**: Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division; inadequate zinc impairs growth, sexual maturation and neurologic development (notably in fetuses, infants and adolescents).
- **Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions**: Cofactor for superoxide dismutase and involved in inflammatory modulation.
- **Wound healing**: Required for collagen synthesis, epithelialization and immune function; deficiency delays wound healing. Topical zinc oxide creams protect against UV radiation and treat dermatitis, burns and diaper rash.
- **Taste and smell**: Required for gustin, a salivary enzyme; deficiency may cause dysgeusia or anosmia.
- **Other roles**: Supports reproductive health (spermatogenesis, ovulation), glucose metabolism and neurological function.

---

## Clinical Uses of Zinc

- **Treatment of zinc deficiency**: Oral supplementation (zinc gluconate, sulfate or acetate) corrects deficiency states. Standard supplementation doses vary by age; caution is required to avoid exceeding the UL.
- **Childhood acute diarrhea**: In low- and middle-income countries where zinc deficiency is prevalent, the WHO recommends zinc supplementation (10–20 mg/day for 10–14 days) to reduce duration and severity of acute diarrhea; benefits stem from improved immune response and intestinal mucosal integrity.
- **Common cold**: Some randomized trials suggest that zinc lozenges or syrup (within 24 hours of symptom onset) may shorten cold duration by ~1 day, though evidence is mixed and adverse effects (nausea, bad taste) are common. Intranasal zinc should be avoided because it can cause permanent loss of smell.
- **Wound healing**: Patients with zinc deficiency and chronic ulcers may benefit from oral zinc supplementation; topical zinc oxide supports barrier protection.
- **Other exploratory uses**: Research continues on zinc’s potential in pneumonia, age-related macular degeneration, type 2 diabetes and COVID-19; current evidence is inconclusive and routine supplementation beyond the RDA is not recommended.

## Deficiency

### Causes and Risk Factors

Global zinc deficiency is a significant public health issue affecting ~17% of the world’s population, especially children and pregnant women in low-income regions. Deficiency arises from inadequate intake, malabsorption, increased losses or increased requirements. Common risk factors include:

- **Nutritional**: Low meat consumption; diets high in phytates (vegetarian/vegan) or high in calcium or iron; malnutrition or anorexia.
- **Chronic illnesses & malabsorption**: Chronic gastrointestinal diseases (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease), chronic diarrhea, pancreatitis, liver or kidney disease, diabetes, sickle cell disease, HIV infection; burns; hemodialysis; hookworm infestation.
- **Medications**: Penicillamine, certain diuretics (thiazides), sodium valproate, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and some antibiotics can reduce zinc absorption or increase urinary losses.
- **Life stages**: Pregnancy, lactation (higher requirements), preterm infants (low stores), adolescents during growth spurts.
- **Alcohol use disorder**: Decreased absorption and increased urinary loss.

### Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms of zinc deficiency are often nonspecific and include growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, hypogonadism in males, dermatitis (erythematous or eczematous rash), alopecia, impaired taste and smell, poor appetite, depressed mood, diarrhoea, delayed wound healing, recurrent infections and impaired cognitive development. In severe cases (e.g., acrodermatitis enteropathica), life-threatening infections and failure to thrive occur.

### Diagnosis & Management

Serum or plasma zinc levels (normal 80–120 µg/dL) are commonly measured; levels <70 µg/dL in women and <74 µg/dL in men suggest deficiency but can be influenced by inflammation, fasting state, time of day and albumin levels. Clinicians should assess dietary intake, risk factors and clinical signs. Treatment involves oral zinc supplementation (often 2–3 times RDA in deficiency) along with addressing underlying causes.

## Toxicity & Adverse Effects

Excess zinc is usually due to supplements, denture cream overuse or industrial exposure (welding fumes). The UL for adults (19+ years) is 40 mg/day. Toxicity is rare from food but may occur at intakes >50 mg/day. Features include:

- **Acute GI symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramps and diarrhea; these are the most common signs of toxicity.
- **Neurologic and hematologic effects**: Chronic high-dose intake (100–150 mg/day for months) interferes with copper absorption, leading to copper deficiency, anemia, neutropenia, hyperlipidemia and peripheral neuropathy. Severe overdose (200–800 mg/day) causes vomiting, anorexia, dizziness, headaches and impaired immunity.
- **Metal fume fever**: Inhalation of zinc oxide fumes in industrial settings causes “metal fume fever”—flu-like syndrome with fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, nausea and metallic taste; it is usually self-limited after removal from exposure.
- **Interactions**: Zinc can chelate tetracycline and quinolone antibiotics and penicillamine, reducing their absorption. High iron, calcium or phosphorus intake competes for zinc absorption, and high zinc intake reduces copper and iron absorption. Thiazide diuretics increase urinary zinc loss; ACE inhibitors can reduce absorption.

Management of toxicity involves discontinuing excess zinc, correcting associated copper deficiency and symptomatic care. There is no specific antidote.

## Drug & Nutrient Interactions

- **Antibiotics**: Zinc binds fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and tetracyclines, decreasing their bioavailability; separate doses by at least 2 hours.
- **Chelating agents**: Penicillamine, used for Wilson’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis, chelates zinc; supplementation may be necessary.
- **Iron & copper**: High iron supplements (>25 mg) reduce zinc absorption; high zinc reduces copper and iron absorption; separation by 2 hours is recommended.
- **Diuretics (thiazides)**: Increase urinary zinc loss, potentially inducing deficiency; monitor long-term therapy.
- **Calcium, phosphorus & phytates**: These minerals and dietary phytates reduce zinc absorption; individuals reliant on plant-based diets may require higher intake.

---

## Special Populations

- **Pregnancy & lactation**: Requirements increase due to fetal growth and lactation; most women meet needs through diet, but those with limited dietary diversity or malabsorption may need supplementation (under medical supervision).
- **Infants & children**: Breast milk contains limited zinc after 6 months; complementary foods rich in zinc are essential. WHO recommends zinc supplementation in diarrheal disease.
- **Vegetarians & vegans**: Reliance on plant sources leads to lower bioavailability; consumption of soaked/fermented legumes and grains can improve absorption.
- **Older adults**: Often have reduced dietary intake and absorption; chronic illnesses and medications (diuretics) increase risk of deficiency.
- **Alcohol use disorder & chronic diseases**: Increased urinary loss and decreased absorption necessitate monitoring and possible supplementation.
- **Genetic disorders**: Acrodermatitis enteropathica (SLC39A4 mutation) causes severe, life-threatening zinc malabsorption requiring lifelong supplementation.

## Conclusion

Zinc is a vital micronutrient required for enzymatic catalysis, gene expression, growth, immune defense and tissue repair. Most healthy individuals meet requirements through a balanced diet rich in meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains. However, deficiency remains a global health issue, particularly in children and pregnant women in low-income regions and in individuals with malabsorption or high phytate diets. The recommended intake for adults is 11 mg/day for men and 8 mg/day for women, with a tolerable upper limit of 40 mg/day. Clinicians should be mindful of populations at risk for deficiency or excessive intake, monitor zinc status appropriately and counsel patients on safe supplementation.
