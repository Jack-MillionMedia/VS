# Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)

**Context:** Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment that involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber. This informational document provides an overview of HBOT applications, mechanisms, and considerations for healthcare practitioners.

## Overview

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy delivers 100% oxygen at 2-3 times normal atmospheric pressure, significantly increasing oxygen levels in the bloodstream. This enhanced oxygen delivery supports various physiological processes and promotes healing.

## Key Concepts

### Mechanism of Action

**Oxygen Delivery Enhancement:**
- Increases oxygen-carrying capacity of blood
- Enhances oxygen delivery to tissues and organs
- Stimulates production of growth factors and stem cells
- Supports tissue repair and regeneration

**Physiological Effects:**
- Promotes angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation)
- Reduces inflammation (decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines)
- Antimicrobial effects (inhibits certain bacteria)
- Enhances antibiotic effectiveness
- Supports detoxification (removes carbon monoxide, cyanide)

## Clinical Applications

### FDA-Approved Indications

1. **Decompression Sickness** (diving-related)
2. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**
3. **Severe Anemia** (when blood transfusions not possible)
4. **Gas Gangrene**
5. **Sudden Hearing Loss**
6. **Radiation Tissue Damage**
7. **Skin Grafts/Flaps** (at risk of tissue death)
8. **Chronic Non-Healing Wounds** (diabetic foot ulcers, pressure sores)

### Emerging Applications

**Neurological Conditions:**
- Traumatic brain injury recovery
- Concussion rehabilitation
- Stroke rehabilitation
- Long COVID symptoms (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction)

**Other Applications:**
- Athletic recovery and performance
- Inflammatory conditions (IBD, post-surgical recovery)
- Chronic infections (osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis)

## Treatment Considerations

### Benefits

- Accelerates wound healing
- Reduces inflammation
- Enhances tissue repair
- Supports neurological recovery
- Antimicrobial properties
- Improves circulation

### Limitations and Side Effects

**Rare Side Effects:**
- Ear barotrauma (pressure-related ear injury)
- Temporary vision changes
- Oxygen toxicity (with prolonged sessions)
- Claustrophobia

**Considerations:**
- Requires medical supervision
- FDA approval status varies by condition
- Cost and accessibility may be limiting factors
- Not appropriate for all conditions

## Safety and Contraindications

**Contraindications:**
- Untreated pneumothorax
- Certain medications (consult provider)
- Severe claustrophobia
- Recent ear surgery (relative contraindication)

**Precautions:**
- Always ensure FDA approval for specific condition
- Administer under medical supervision
- Monitor for side effects during treatment

## Clinical Integration

**When to Consider:**
- Chronic non-healing wounds
- FDA-approved conditions
- Adjunctive support for neurological recovery
- Post-surgical wound complications

**Referral Considerations:**
- Requires specialized facilities and equipment
- Typically provided by certified HBOT centers
- May require multiple sessions (protocol-dependent)

## Research Status

**Evidence Base:**
- Strong evidence for FDA-approved indications
- Emerging evidence for neurological applications
- Ongoing research for additional applications

**Research Needs:**
- Long-term outcomes for emerging applications
- Optimal treatment protocols
- Cost-effectiveness analyses
