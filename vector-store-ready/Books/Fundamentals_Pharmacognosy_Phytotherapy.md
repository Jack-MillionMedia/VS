### European Pharmacognosy and Natural Product Chemistry in the 18th and 19th Centuries

In our physiological studies we were able to identify the effect of the American arrow poison curare as one on the nervous motoric element and subsequently to determine a mechanism which results in death, which is an inert ability of this poisoned substance, but do we have to stop here and have we reached the border which our current [19th century] science allows us to reach? I do not think so. One has to separate the active principle of curare from the foreign substances, with which it is mixed, and one also has to study which physical and chemical changes the toxic substance imprints onto the organic element [i.e. the body] in order to paralyse its activity.

∗ In some cases, there is first a name in parentheses, followed by a second name not in parentheses. For example, in the case of the common aloe, Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f., the name in parentheses indicates the author (Linnaeus) who first described the species but assigned it to a different genus. The second name in this case, Burm. f., stands for the 18th century botanist Nicolaas Laurens Burman; f. stands for filius (son), since he is the son of another well-known botanist who provided numerous first descriptions of botanical species.

# 5: Ethnobotany and Ethnopharmacology

harnessing the potential contribution of TM to health, wellness and people-centred health care;

promoting the safe and effective use of TM by regulating, researching and integrating TM products, practitioners and practice into health systems, where appropriate.

We support broadening and extending access to a range of health care services through the use of high-quality, safe, effective and affordable medicines, including, as appropriate, traditional medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other technologies.

## Ethnopharmacology

TABLE 5.1

a Examples of plants commonly used in European phytotherapy. In general, the others are not used as an extract but as pure compounds, or served as a model for developing semisynthetic drugs or as standardised (normalised) extracts.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Story of Curare

He [an old Indian] was the chemist of the community. With him we saw large boilers (Siedekessel) made out of clay, to be used for boiling the plant sap; plainer containers, which speed up the evaporation process because of their large surface; banana leaves, rolled to form a cone-shaped bag [and] used to filter the liquid which may contain varying amounts of fibres. This hut transformed into a laboratory was very tidy and clean.

We are unable to make a botanical identification because this tree [which produces the raw material for the production of curare] only grows at quite some distance from Esmeralda and because [it] did not have flowers and fruit. I had mentioned this type of misfortune previously, that the most noteworthy plants cannot be examined by the traveller, while others whose chemical activities are not known [i.e. which are not used ethnobotanically] are found covered with thousands of flowers and fruit.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Role of the Ethnobotanist

<!-- chunk -->

## Ethnopharmacology and the Convention on Biological Diversity (Convention of Rio)

The objectives of this Convention, to be pursued in accordance with its relevant provisions, are the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding.

States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.

Subject to its national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices.

15.1. Recognizing the sovereign rights of States over their natural resources, the authority to determine access to genetic resources rests with the national governments and is subject to national legislation.

15.5. Access to genetic resources shall be subject to prior informed consent of the Contracting Party providing such resources, unless otherwise determined by that Party.

15.7. Each Contracting Party shall take legislative, administrative or policy measures…with the aim of sharing in a fair and equitable way the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources. Such sharing shall be upon mutually agreed terms.

### Tridosha: Vata, Pitta and Kapha—the Three Humours

TABLE 16.3.1

To find the Ayurvedic constitution, just tick the most relevant description, and count up the ticks in each column to determine the dominant type. It may not just show one pure type, but, for example, vata-pitta or pitta-kapha. Then the best diet for a particular constitution can be found. Foods that aggravate a particular dosha should not be taken in excess by a person of that type; for example, a vata person should not take excessive amounts of lamb, cabbage, potatoes or dried fruits. However, eggs, rice, cooked vegetables and sweet fruits would be beneficial to someone of vata constitution. It can also be used to decide which type of food to eat in different seasons. For example, in summer, pitta predominates, and those foods that aggravate pitta should be avoided; but winter is the season of kapha, so seafood, melon and cows’ milk products are not recommended then. Autumn is the season of vata, and spring is kapha-pitta.
