## 757CHAPTER 99 Panax ginseng (Korean Ginseng)

• Polyacetylene derivatives β -elemene and panaxynol • 8% to 32% starch • Low-molecular-weight polysaccharides • Pectin • Vitamins (e.g., thiamine, riboflavin, B 12 , nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin) • 0.1% to 0.2% choline • Minerals (including germanium)5 • Simple sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, trisaccharides, etc.) • Unique proteins (e.g., panaxagin, a protein that possesses antifungal, antiviral, translation-inhibiting, and ribonuclease activities)5 • Various flavonoids Although it was reported that ginseng contains large amounts of germanium (i.e., 300 ppm), a follow-up study using highly sen- sitive (detection limit of 1 ppb), flameless atomic absorption spec- trometry combined with solvent extraction demonstrated that the highest concentration of germanium measured in samples of gin- seng purchased in the Osaka market was only 6 ppb.6 More research is needed to accurately determine the germanium content of botan- ical medicines, because the reported concentrations vary widely. Such low levels suggest that a connection between the pharmacol- ogy of ginseng and its germanium content is unlikely.

# HISTORY AND FOLK USE

Perhaps the most famous medicinal plant of China, ginseng has been generally used alone or in combination with other herbs to restore the “Yang” quality. It has also been used as a tonic for its revitaliz- ing properties, especially after a long illness. Conditions for which ginseng is used in folk medicine are shown in Box 99.1. It has been used as an alterative, anodyne, aperitif, aphrodisiac, cardiotonic, car- minative, emetic, estrogenic, expectorant, gonadotrophic, nervine, sedative, sialogogue, stimulant, stomachic, and tranquilizer.1,2 As can be seen, ginseng reflects a broad range of nutritional and medicinal properties.

# PHARMACOLOGY AND CLINICAL INDICATIONS

Since the 1950s, significant research has been conducted worldwide to determine whether the therapeutic properties attributed to gin- seng are legend or fact. Unfortunately, inconsistent outcomes result- ing from different procedures in the preparation of extracts, use of nonofficial parts of the plant, use of adulterants, and lack of quality control in the ginseng used, have made the determination of gin- seng’s true properties difficult. Nonetheless, research does exist to indicate that ginseng possesses pharmacological activity, especially when high-quality extracts, standardized for active constituents, are used (Fig. 99.4). Over the years, ginseng has been reported to have numerous phar- macological effects in humans and laboratory animals, including1,2: • General stimulatory effects during stress • Decrease in sensitivity to stress • Increase in mental and physical capacity for work • Improved endocrine system function • Amelioration of radiation sickness, experimental neurosis, and cancer • Enhanced protein synthesis and cell reproduction • Improved glucose control in diabetes • Modulation of various immune system parameters • Lowering of serum cholesterol • Protection of the liver from hepatotoxins Some of these actions are discussed in greater detail in the following sections.

## Adaptogenic and Antistress Activity

Ginseng was originally investigated for its adaptogenic qualities. An adaptogen was defined in 1957 by the Russian pharmacologist I. I. Brekhman2 as a substance with the following properties: • It must be innocuous and cause minimal disorders in the physio- logical functions of an organism. • It must have a nonspecific action (i.e., it should increase resistance to adverse influences through a wide range of physical, chemical, and biochemical factors). • It usually has a normalizing action irrespective of the direction of the pathological state. According to tradition and scientific evidence, ginseng possesses this kind of equilibrating, tonic, antistress action. Thus the term adaptogen is quite appropriate to describe its effects.2

## 758SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

From a clinical perspective, ginseng can be used as a general tonic, especially in debilitated and feeble individuals. This use is consistent with its historic application. It can also be used as an antistress aid because it has been shown to enhance the ability to cope with various stressors, both physical and mental. Ginseng delays the alarm phase response in Selye’s classic model of stress. Animal studies found that adrenal cholesterol levels were many times higher in animals given ginseng than in their matched controls, indicating greater tolerance of stress and delayed alarm phase response.7-9 Italian researchers studied the effect of a standardized ginseng extract, the ginsenoside composition of which was accurately deter- mined, on the adrenal functions of rats exposed to cold.8 The gin- seng extract significantly counteracted body temperature decline without affecting blood glucose or cortisone levels. In a group of adrenalectomized rats, the ginseng extract had no significant effects. Administration of hydrocortisone to the adrenalectomized rats did, however, cause body temperature to be maintained when the rats were exposed to cold. Histological findings in this study were as follows: • Evidence of hyperfunctioning in the supraoptic and paraventricu- lar nuclei of the hypothalamus in rats fed the ginseng extract • Remarkable increase in corticotropic basophilic cells (adrenocor- ticotropic hormone [ACTH] producing) in the pars distalis of the pituitary gland • Hyperplasia of the adrenal zona fasciculata, indicating that hyper- functioning of the adrenal was promoted by the administration of the ginseng extract. Other researchers demonstrated that ginseng saponins significantly increased plasma ACTH and corticosteroids (in a parallel kinetic pat- tern).10,11 Because this effect could be blocked by dexamethasone (which acts on the hypothalamus and pituitary to prevent ACTH release), it was concluded that ginsenosides act predominantly on the hypothalamus or pituitary to promote secretion of ACTH. This conclusion was confirmed further by indirect studies. ACTH first stimulates an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the adrenal and then promotes corticosteroid synthesis. Ginseng administration was shown to increase adrenal cAMP in normal rats but not in hypophysectomized rats.

## 759CHAPTER 99 Panax ginseng (Korean Ginseng)

These investigations indicate that ginseng’s antistress action is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as follows: • The antistress action of ginseng is greatly reduced by adrenalec- tomy. • Ginseng continues to exert its antistress action after hypophysec- tomy only if ACTH is administered. • Histological and chemical evidence demonstrate a strong link between ginseng and the HPA axis. • Dexamethasone blocks the effects of ginseng. ACTH and corticosteroids have been shown to bind directly to brain tissue to increase mental activities during stress. Therefore the release of ACTH and associated pituitary substances (e.g., β -lipopro- tein, endorphins, enkephalins) coupled with their end organ effects are likely responsible for many of the antifatigue and antistress actions of ginseng. From a clinical perspective, it is apparent that ginseng has a balancing effect or alterative action on the HPA axis through adjust- ment of metabolic and functional systems governing hormonal control of homeostasis. Ginseng assists the body’s response to the challenge of stress and, therefore, is indicated when there is a disruption in the HPA axis. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced with- in-group human study investigated the effect on constitutive and stress-induced effects of a Korean ginseng supplement on HPA and antioxidant activity.12 Ten women and nine men completed three 14-day treatment cycles with different doses (high: 960 mg; low: mg; placebo: 0 mg) separated by a 1-week washout period. Ginseng supplementation produced stress-inducible dose-dependent reduc- tions in circulating cortisol and increased enzymatic and nonspe- cific antioxidant activity. Twenty-four hours after intense exercise, a high-dose bioactive ginsenoside metabolite (GINST15) significantly reduced muscle damage and HPA responses to physical stress. Ginseng may be effective in restoration of normal adrenal function and prevention of adrenal atrophy associated with corti- costeroid administration. In rats, ginseng was found to inhibit cortisone- induced adrenal and thymic atrophy.13

## Antifatigue (Mental and Physical) Activity

Some of the first studies of ginseng’s adaptogenic activities were performed during the late 1950s and early 1960s by Brekhman and Dardymov14,15 in the Soviet Union and by Petkov16-18 in Bulgaria. In one of Brekhman’s experiments, Soviet soldiers given an extract of ginseng ran faster in a 3-km race than those given a pla- cebo. In another, radio operators tested after administration of gin- seng extract transmitted text significantly faster and with fewer mistakes than those given placebo. These and similar results reported by European researchers, who demonstrated improvement in human

physical and mental performance after administration of ginseng extracts, prompted researchers to confirm the results in experimental models using mice.2,14,15,19 In perhaps the best known of these experiments, mice were sub- jected to swimming in cold water or running up an apparently endless rope to determine whether ginseng could lengthen the time to exhaus- tion. A dose-dependent increase in time to exhaustion was noted in mice receiving ginseng, indicating that ginseng possessed significant antifatigue activity.2,15,20-22 In one study, the time to exhaustion was lengthened by up to 183% in mice given ginseng 30 minutes before exercising, compared with controls.15 Experimental animal studies indicated that much of the antifatigue action of ginseng was due to the stimulant effect of ginseng on the cen- tral nervous system (CNS). Ginseng has been shown to improve loco- motor activity,23 modify electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings,17 improve metabolic activity in the CNS,24 and affect the HPA axis (dis- cussed later), all of which could be responsible for ginseng’s antifatigue activity in mental and physical performance. The CNS activity of gin- seng is essentially different from that of typical stimulants. Although stimulants are active under most situations, ginseng reveals its stimu- latory action only with the challenge of stress.24 On the physical level, stress coupled with ginseng ingestion induced alterations in energy metabolism during prolonged exercise. Exercise physiologists established that during prolonged exercise, the develop- ment of fatigue is closely related to the depletion of glycogen stores and the buildup of lactic acid, both in skeletal muscle and in the liver. If an adequate supply of oxygen is available to the working muscle, nonesterified fatty acids are the preferential energy substrate, thus sparing use of muscle glycogen, blood glucose, and, consequently, liver glycogen. The greater the ability to conserve body carbohydrate stores through mobilization and oxidizing of fatty acids, the greater the amount of time to exhaustion. Ginseng enhances fatty acid oxidation during prolonged exercise, thereby sparing muscle glycogen stores.9 Mental and physical antifatigue activity effects have been demon- strated in animal studies and double-blind clinical trials in humans. In one double-blind clinical study, nurses who switched from day to night duty rated themselves for competence, mood, and general well-being, and were evaluated with an objective test of psychophys- ical performance, blood cell counts, and blood chemistry analysis. The group administered ginseng demonstrated higher scores in com- petence, mood parameters, and objective psychophysical perfor- mance than those who received a placebo.25 The antifatigue effects of enzyme-modified ginseng extract (EMGE) were investigated in healthy adults in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fifty- two healthy subjects were randomly allocated into one of two groups: EMGE (2000 mg/day) or placebo. EMGE or placebo were admin- istered to each group for 4 weeks.26 Fatigue scores using the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS) and Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (RPFS) were considered as the primary outcome measure. Life-quality scores were investigated using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that there was a signif- icant difference in the VAFS scores between the treatment and placebo groups after 4 weeks, with the treatment group’s score decreasing more than that of the placebo group. Although there was no difference in the RPFS and SF-36 scores between the two groups, EMGE treatment for weeks decreased fatigue severity in a healthy population. From a clinical standpoint, cancer patients who underwent che- motherapy, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and athletes were all shown to benefit from ginseng use. In one double-blind study, 92 adults with COPD were randomly assigned to receive either ginseng or placebo.27 Pulmonary func- tion tests, maximum voluntary ventilation, maximum inspiratory pressure, and maximal oxygen consumption were studied before treatment and every 2 weeks throughout the 3-month study. In the ginseng group, but not in the control group, all parameters were sig- nificantly higher than baseline and higher than the placebo group. Maximum increases, in comparison with baseline, were forced vital capacity (32.5%), forced expiratory volume 1.0 (27.0%), maxi- mum voluntary ventilation (40.4%), maximum inspiratory pressure (47.0%), and maximal oxygen consumption (37.5%). No side effects were observed. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most common and severe symptom in patients with cancer. In a large double-blind study of cancer patients, subjects were randomized to receive American ginseng in doses of 750, 1000, or 2000 mg/day or placebo given in twice daily dosing over 8 weeks. Over twice as many patients on ginseng perceived a benefit and were satisfied with treatment compared with those on placebo.28 In another double-blind trial, 53 cancer patients were ran- domly assigned to receive ginseng (3000 mg/day) or placebo for weeks. Quality of life was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and the General Health Questionnaire-12.29 After 12 weeks of therapy, the “psycholog- ical domain” score of the WHOQOL-BREF was significantly improved in patients randomized to ginseng, compared with those randomized to placebo. There was a tendency for ginseng to improve the “physical health” and “environment” domain scores of the WHOQOL-BREF, compared with placebo. The General Health Questionnaire-12 total score was significantly improved in patients treated with ginseng than in those with placebo. In a prospective, open-label study, 30 patients with CRF ( ≥ 4/10) received high-dose Panax ginseng (PG) at 800 mg orally daily for 29 days.30 Scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale, Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were assessed at baseline, day 15, and day 29. Global Symptom Evaluation (GSE) was assessed at day 29. Of the 24 evaluable patients, 21 (87%) had an improved (by ≥ 3 points) FACIT-F score by day 15. The mean ESAS score (standard deviation) for well-being improved from 4.67 (2.04) to 3.50 (2.34) (P = 0.01374), and mean score for appetite improved from 4.29 (2.79) to 2.96 (2.46) (P = 0.0097). GSE score of PG for fatigue was ≥ 3 in 15/24 patients (63%) with median improvement of 5. Thus PG is safe and improves CRF fatigue as well as overall quality of life, appetite, and sleep at night.

## Cognitive Performance

Standardized extracts of P. ginseng alone or in combination with Ginkgo biloba (a formula called Gincosan) were shown to improve cognitive performance in animal and clinical studies.31-41 In university students in Italy (a double-blind, crossover design), ginseng extract alone was compared with placebo in various tests of psychomotor performance.33A favorable effect of ginseng relative to baseline perfor- mance was observed in attention (cancellation test), mental arithmetic, logical deduction, integrated sensorimotor function (choice reaction time), and auditory reaction time. However, statistically significant superiority of the ginseng group over the placebo group was noted only for mental arithmetic. It was interesting to note that during the trial, the students taking ginseng reported a greater sensation of well-being. Later studies in college-aged students showed similar results with a dose dependence response.34-36 The benefits of ginseng on cognitive performance, mood, and qual- ity of life assessment are considerably greater in middle-aged adults than in younger adults. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, crossover study examined the effect of a ginsenoside-rich extract of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) on working memory and

## 761CHAPTER 99 Panax ginseng (Korean Ginseng)

mood in healthy middle-aged individuals.37 Fifty-two healthy volun- teers (40–60 years old, mean age 51.63) received 200 mg of P. quinque- folius or a matching placebo. The Cognitive Drug Research battery and the Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System were used to evaluate cognitive performance at baseline then 1, 3, and 6 hours after treatment. Compared with placebo, P. quinquefolius improved cognitive performance on ‘Working Memory’ factor at 3 hours. Similar effects were observed in one of the two tasks making up this factor: spatial working memory. Unlike studies in older subjects, no positive effect on mood or qual- ity of life has yet been demonstrated with the administration of gin- seng to healthy young adults. In several studies of the administration of ginseng alone or in combination with G. biloba extract, significant improvements in tests of cognition and memory were noted, in addi- tion to social functioning and mental health.38-40 One study demon- strated attenuation of ginseng’s effects after 4 weeks of use, indicating that cotherapy with G. biloba may be more efficacious or that cycling of the ginseng dosage may be necessary to produce a prolonged effect.40 G. biloba and P. ginseng have been shown to modulate aspects of cognitive performance, including effects on EEG recordings. One double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, crossover experiment of 15 healthy volunteers assessed the effects of single doses of G. biloba extract (360 mg), a proprietary P. ginseng extract (200 mg G115), and an identical placebo on auditory-evoked potentials, contingent nega- tive variation, and resting power within the δ , θ , α , and β wavebands.41 The results showed that ginseng use led to a significant shortening of the latency of the P300 component of the evoked potential. Both ginseng and ginkgo also led to significant reductions in frontal “eyes closed” θ and β activity, with additional reduction for ginseng in the α waveband. These findings were the first to demonstrate that P. gin- seng can directly modulate EEG activity, and that these effects are more pronounced than those that follow ingestion of G. biloba. Additional studies with G115 also showed an ability to enhance cognitive function in normal subjects.42-44 Results from an open-label study suggest ginseng may improve cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).45 In the study, consecutive AD patients were randomly assigned to the ginseng (n = 58) or the control group (n = 39). The ginseng group was treated with P. ginseng powder (4.5 g/day) for 12 weeks. Cognitive performances were monitored using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale (ADAS) during 12 weeks of the ginseng treatment and for 12 weeks after discontinuing ginseng. MMSE and ADAS scales showed no baseline difference between the groups. After ginseng treatment, the cognitive subscale of ADAS and the MMSE scores began to show improvements and continued up to 12 weeks. After discontinuing ginseng, the improved ADAS and MMSE scores declined to the levels of the control group. These results suggest that P. ginseng is clinically effective in the cognitive performance of AD patients.

## Ergogenic Aid

The benefits of ginseng on athletic performance are not clear, and results at this time do not support claims that ginseng improves ath- letic performance. However, other benefits have been noted, such as an ability to protect against muscle injury and inflammation in ath- letes, reduced exercise-induced oxidative stress, reduced postexercise plasma creatine kinase levels, as well as improved psychomotor perfor- mance at rest during a graded exercise test.46-49

## Diabetes

Ginseng, alone or in combination with other botanicals, has a long folk use in the treatment of diabetes. Hypoglycemic activity was confirmed in both experimental and clinical trials. In one double-blind study in type 2 diabetes, ginseng therapy reduced fasting blood glucose levels, elevated mood, improved psychophysical performance, and lowered body weight and glycosylated hemoglobin.50 The chief constituents responsible for this effect are51-55: • Five glycans (polysaccharides designated panaxans A to E) • Adenosine • A carboxylic acid • A peptide • A fraction designated DPG-3-2 The ratio of ginsenosides appears to be an important factor. In one human study, the ratio of protopanaxadiol/protopanaxatriol was the sole predictor of whether a ginseng preparation would exert hypogly- cemic effects.56 It may be important to use crude, standardized extracts having a higher protopanaxadiol/protopanaxatriol ratio, such as those from American ginseng extract, to produce the desired benefit. Powdered American ginseng root (P. quinquefolius) at a dosage of about 3 g before each meal was shown to significantly reduce postpran- dial blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. It was determined that American ginseng stimulated pancreatic β -cells, with a subsequent increase in insulin secretion. American ginseng also has significant antioxidant properties, improves cognitive function, and possesses nerve protection and regeneration properties. This could prove to be valuable in diabetes considering peripheral and autonomic nerve dam- age often occurs.57-59 It is interesting to note that ginseng raises serum cortisol levels in nondiabetic individuals but reduces serum cortisol levels in patients with diabetes.60 Because cortisol antagonizes insulin, this is presum- ably a beneficial effect. This again demonstrates ginseng’s nonspecific balancing effect, which is baffling to researchers accustomed to investi- gating compounds with consistent pharmacological effects. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover design study of patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes, each participant received the selected ginseng preparation (rootlets) or placebo at the selected dose (2 g/meal = 6 g/day) and mode of administration (preprandial oral agent [−40 minutes]) for 12 weeks as an adjunct to their usual antidiabetic therapy (diet and/or medications).61 Although there was no change in glycosylated hemoglobin, ginseng treatment decreased 75 g oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose (OGTT-PG) indexes by 8% and fasting plasma insulin (PI) and 75 g OGTT-PG indexes by 33%, and increased the fasting insulin sensitivity index and 75 g OGTT-insulin sensitivity index by 33%, compared with placebo. In another double-blind study, improvements were seen with American ginseng supplementation on fasting blood sugar levels and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients.62 Proposed mech- anisms included effects on insulin release from pancreatic β -cells, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and increasing insulin sensitivity related to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing ginseng supplementation versus control in patients with T2DM or impaired glucose tolerance found no significant difference in Hb A 1c levels between the ginseng supplementation and the con- trol groups (pooled standardized difference in means = −0.148, 95% CI: −0.637 to 0.228, P = 0.355).63 Ginseng supplementation improved fasting glucose, postprandial insulin, and HOMA-IR levels, though no difference in postprandial glucose or fasting insulin was observed among the groups. Similarly, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein levels showed significant difference between the treatment groups, whereas no difference in high-density lipopro- tein was seen. In addition, ginseng-related therapy was ineffective in decreasing the fasting glucose levels in patients treated with oral hypo- glycemic agents or insulin. The authors concluded that these results

establish the benefit of ginseng supplementation in improving glucose control and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose intolerance. Ginseng appears useful as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of diabetes, both for its antihyperglycemic effect and for its ability to decrease the atherogenic index. Although the root has received the most attention, animal studies indicate that extracts from the ginseng berry may be more beneficial as a result of a higher concentration of ginsenoside R e .60,62,64

## Reproductive Effects

Although ginseng is claimed to be a “sexual rejuvenator” and aphrodi- siac, human studies supporting these effects are limited. However, in animal studies, ginseng was shown to65,66: • Promote the growth of the testes and increase spermatogenesis in rabbits • Accelerate the growth of the ovary and enhance ovulation in frogs • Stimulate egg-laying in hens • Facilitate lordotic response in female rats • Increase gonadal weight in both male and female rats • Raise testicular nucleic acid content in rats • Increase sexual activity and mating behavior in male rats Ginseng was also shown to increase testosterone levels while reduc- ing prostate weight in animals.67 This suggests that ginseng should have favorable effects in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, no clinical trials have been reported. Ginsenosides were shown to bind to human myometrial receptor proteins and exert estrogen-like action on the vaginal epithelium sig- nificantly enough to prevent the atrophic vaginal changes associated with postmenopause and other menopausal symptoms.68 Korean red ginseng (KRG) is known to have beneficial effects on women’s health as a result of its estrogen-like function. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a signif- icant endocrine disrupting chemical having estrogen-like effects. In a single-blind randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety outcomes of KRG against BPA were evaluated, focusing on female quality of life (QOL).69 Young women (N = 22) consumed 2.7 g of KRG or placebo per day for 2 weeks and completed questionnaires regarding gyne- cological complaints at four time spots. Urinary levels of total BPA and malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress biomarker, were also analyzed. KRG consumption decreased urinary BPA and MDA levels and alleviated “menstrual irregularity,” “menstrual pain,” and “constipation.” Based on historical use and experimental evidence, other clinical indications involving the reproductive system include decreased sperm counts, testicular atrophy or hypofunction, organic causes of male infertility, ovarian atrophy or hypofunction, amenorrhea, and organic causes of female infertility. It should be noted that several reports of mastalgia were reported in women taking ginseng.70,71 Many clinical studies involving reproductive effects focused on gin- seng’s effect on erectile dysfunction (ED). Ginsenosides can facilitate penile erection by directly inducing the vasodilatation and relaxation of penile corpus cavernosum mediated by the release and/or modifica- tion of the release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells and perivascu- lar nerves.72-74 In one double-blind, crossover study, 45 patients with clinically diagnosed ED showed significantly higher mean International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores with Korean red ginseng than those who received placebo.74 In response to the global efficacy question, 60% of the patients answered that Korean red ginseng improved erection. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a tissue-cultured mountain ginseng extract (TMGE) or placebo was given to 86 male patients with ED.75 Over the course of 8 weeks, one group took mg of TMGE twice a day, and the other group took 1000 mg of placebo twice a day. The effects of the TMGE and the placebo were analyzed using the IIEF questionnaire. All 86 patients completed 8 weeks of treatment. The scores on the five domains of the IIEF after medication were significantly higher than the baseline scores in the group treated with TMGE, whereas no significant improvement was observed in the placebo group. Erectile function and overall satisfaction scores after medication were significantly higher in the TMGE group compared with the placebo group. In another double-blind study, 60 patients presenting with mild or mild to moderate ED were given either P. ginseng at a dosage of mg three times daily or a placebo.76 The IIEF score after treatment was significantly higher in the ginseng group compared with before the treatment. In contrast, there was no difference before and after the treatment in the placebo group.

## Menopause

Ginseng is a popular treatment for menopausal symptoms. However, clinical research is unconvincing. A double-blind study of 384 meno- pausal women was performed to compare the effects of a standardized ginseng extract with those of a placebo on quality of life, menopausal symptoms, and physiological markers of menopause (follicle-stimu- lating hormone and estradiol levels, endometrial thickness, maturity index, and vaginal pH).77 Although the ginseng extract showed no sta- tistically significant effects on the physiological parameters, including vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), it was associated with statistically significant improvements in mood and well-being. A systematic review of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials provided posi- tive evidence of ginseng for sexual function and KRG for sexual arousal and total hot flashes score in menopausal women, but the results of KRG or ginseng failed to show specific effects on hot flash frequency, hormones, biomarkers, or endometrial thickness.78

## Cell-Proliferating, Antioxidant, and Antiaging Effects

Ginseng has a dual effect on cell growth. It stimulates cell division in an adequate nutritional environment but acts cytostatically under adverse conditions. Furthermore, ginseng yielded impressive results in length- ening the life span of cells in culture.79 Enhancement of cellular proliferation and function has been shown in a variety of cell types (e.g., epithelial, hepatic, lymphocyte, fibro- blast, thymic), especially nerve cells, which may be a result of poten- tiation of nerve growth factor by ginsenosides.3,80-82 Clinically, these results indicate a potential use of ginseng in healing damage to virtually all tissue types, particularly the brain. In animal studies, ginseng was shown to reduce oxidative stress, scavenge free radicals directly, protect endothelial cells from dam- age, and increase cellular antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase.83-88

## Immunomodulating Effects

Ginseng enhances the following immune functions89-96: • Antibody plaque-forming cell response • Circulatory antibody titer against sheep erythrocytes • Cell-mediated immunity • Natural killer (NK) cell activity • The production of interferon • Lymphocyte mitogenesis • Reticuloendothelial system proliferative and phagocytic functions In addition to these immunostimulatory aspects, ginseng com- ponents were shown to exert antiallergy and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental models.97,98 Ginsenosides regulate inflam- matory responses primarily through the inhibition of the NF- κβ

signaling pathways. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mac- rophages and microglial cells, ginsenosides suppress the produc- tion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor- α , interleukin-1 β , and interleukin-6, as well as inflammatory enzymes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2.99 Furthermore, the biological activities of ginsenoside metabolites have been shown to be effective in ameliorating inflammation asso- ciated with several conditions including edema, colitis, atopic der- matitis, and asthma. The long-term ingestion of ginseng by individuals with mild immu- nodeficiency may reduce the risk of viral infection. This is consistent with the historic use of ginseng by debilitated individuals. Clinical evi- dence is also supportive. Extracts of P. ginseng were found to stimulate NK function in normal individuals and patients with either chronic fatigue syndrome or AIDS.100 Ginseng was shown to prevent respira- tory viral infections in a nursing home environment (89% relative risk reduction) and potentiate influenza vaccinations.101,102 Large doses of ginseng may be contraindicated in acute infections considering its in vitro inhibition of lymphocyte transformation (sim- ilar to cortisone) at high (more than 1 mg/mL) but not low concen- trations.103,104 In vitro, ginseng at 1.6 mcg/mL was shown to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes to a greater degree than cortisone at 500 mcg/mL.103 The greatest level of inhibition was observed when ginseng was used in combination with cortisone. These results demonstrate that ginseng at high doses may be effective against T-cell–mediated inflammatory diseases without producing glucocorticoid-like side effects. It also sug- gests that a lower dose of cortisone could be used if ginseng were given simultaneously. When recommending ginseng, the clinician must remember: (1) ginseng’s in vitro effect on lymphocyte proliferation is biphasic (i.e., it exerts a strong inhibition at high concentrations and a moderate stimula- tion at low concentrations); and (2) although ginseng has demonstrated significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, observed effects in vivo show enhancement of lymphocyte proliferation.91 These effects may be related to a dose-dependent ginseng-induced elevation of interferon, which inhibits lymphocyte proliferation.

## Anticancer Properties

In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the anticancer effect of ginseng in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, liver, colon, and skin cancer. Ginseng increases the mitochondrial accu- mulation of apoptosis protein and downregulates the expression of antiapoptotic protein, thus reducing the proliferation of cancerous cells and stopping the angiogenesis process (Fig. 99.5).105 It also aids in the reduction of alopecia, fatigue, and nausea, improves cognitive function, enhances psychomotor performance, and prevents normal cell damage when used with chemotherapeutic drugs. Long-term oral administration of ginseng to newborn mice was shown to reduce the incidence and inhibit the proliferation of tumors induced by various chemical carcinogens, including 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, urethane, and aflatoxin B 1 . In two large population studies, the risk for development of cancer was significantly lower among people who consumed ginseng on a regular basis. Ginseng extract and powder were shown to be more effective than fresh sliced ginseng, ginseng juice, or ginseng tea in reducing cancer risk. A statistically, highly significant dose–response relationship between ginseng intake and cancer risk was observed. These results support the preventive and anticancer effects of ginseng demonstrated in animal and in in vitro studies.106-108 The anticancer effects of ginseng can be summarized as108-112: • Ginseng promotes apoptosis. • The effect is observed only in slow-growing tumors, such as Ehrlich and sarcoma 180 ascites tumor. • The effect is not observed in rapidly growing tumors, such as l1210, p388, and Walker carcinoma. In addition to a possible role in cancer prevention, some researchers are investigating P. ginseng extracts as a possible adjunct in cancer treatment.113 Exerting some direct and indirect anticancer actions, ginseng may also offer protection against che- motherapy-induced damage to normal cells. In one animal study, P. ginseng extract was shown to protect against cisplatin nephro- toxicity.114 A multicenter, large-sample, randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 414 patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer to examine the efficacy of the combination of chemotherapy and Fig. 99.5 The mechanisms of ginseng in cancer.

Ginseng Rg3.115 One hundred and ninety-nine patients were in the experimental group and treated with the standard first-line chemo- therapy combined with Ginseng Rg3, and the 215 patients in the control group were treated with the same chemotherapy combined with placebo. The median overall survival was 12.03 months in the experimental group, which was significantly better than that in the control group (8.46 months). In addition, the combined therapy improved patients’ symptoms and reduced chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evalu- ated the effect of red ginseng on toxicity, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and survival after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).116 A total of 30 patients with EOC were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 15) and red ginseng groups (n = 15). All patients took placebo or red ginseng (3000 mg/day) for 3 months. Changes of genotoxicity, HRQL, and sur- vival were compared between the two groups. In terms of HRQL, red ginseng was associated with improved emotional functioning and decreased symptoms of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and dys- pnea, reduced anxiety and interference affecting life, and improved daytime somnolence. However, there was no effect of red ginseng on prognosis of EOC. There were no differences in adverse events between placebo and red ginseng groups.

## Cardiovascular Effects

In vitro and in vivo results show that ginseng has beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular diseases via several mechanisms including anti- oxidation, control of vasomotor function, modulation of ion channels and signal transduction, improvement of lipid profiles, adjustment of blood pressure, improvement in cardiac function and blood circula- tion, stimulation of nitric oxide generation, enhancement of vasomo- tor tone, and reduction in platelet aggregation (Fig. 99.6).117 From a clinical perspective, ginseng may offer some protection against atherosclerotic disease, further supporting its use as a general tonic. Its effect on improving arterial endothelial function is especially novel,118 and may possess a blood pressure–regulating effect via improvement in the endothelial dysfunction underlying many cases of hypertension.119 A systematic review that included nine randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials of ginseng provides positive evidence for the efficacy of KRG on reducing blood pressure in patients with prehyper- tension and hypertension in acute and long term.120 Ginseng administered to human subjects with hyperlipid- emia was shown to reduce total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acid levels while raising serum high- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Platelet adhesiveness was also decreased.121 These results in humans confirmed earlier studies on rats fed high-cholesterol diets.122,123 The mechanism of action Heart protectioneNOS NO cGMPSN Arrhythmia /cardiac electrophysiology I kr I ca I ka I CaR I CaL I Na Kv L4 Myocardial ischemia /coronary artery disease AntioxidationVasodilation GS, Rb 1 , Rc, Re NO Energy Metabolism Cardiac contractility Cardiac hypertrophy /heart failure Energy metabolism /cardiac contractility Fig. 99.6 Cardiovascular protection by ginseng and ginsenosides. eNOS, Endothelial nitric oxide synthase; GLUT-4, glucose transporter-4; GS, ginsenoside; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; ICa,L, L-type calcium channel current; ICa,R, R-type calcium channel current; IKr, rapidly activating component of delayed rectifier K+ current; IKs, slowly activating component of delayed rectifier K+ current; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K/Akt, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B; ROS, reactive oxy- gen species; RyRs, ryanodine receptors; SN, S-nitrosylation of channel protein; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription.

## Hepatic Effects

Adaptogenic substances must affect the liver because of this organ’s central role in metabolic and detoxification reactions. Ginseng affects the liver in several ways. Several mechanisms of attenuating the dam- age to hepatocytes have been suggested by experimental and clinical studies of ginseng, including inhibition of cytotoxicity, inhibition of oxidative damage, and anti-inflammatory effects by reducing proin- flammatory cytokines.125 These complicated mechanisms can simul- taneously affect the hepatoprotection. Perhaps most important is its ability to produce a marked hyperplasia of the Kupffer cells of the liver and of the folliculi in the spleen and lymph nodes. The hyperplastic folliculi show an increase in the number and volume of light centers, thus demonstrating morphological evidence of increased host defense capacity against a wide variety of external assaults. Because these cells are responsible for filtering out much of the toxins and debris from the portal circulation, increasing their number and activity could have profound effects. Ginseng was shown to reverse diet-induced fatty liver in animals and to possess significant antihepatotoxic action.126 In a clinical study that enrolled 26 Egyptian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the therapeutic effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) was evalu- ated.127 Liver function was assessed at 6 weeks and 11 weeks after oral KRG administration (600 mg/day). A significant decrease in the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were found in patients who received KRG, but not in the control group. In addition, oral administration of KRG resulted in elevated serum albumin levels after 6 weeks of therapy. The same study also revealed KRG administration was associated with a decrease of alpha fetoprotein levels and a decrease in viral loads in patients with hepatitis C compared with control hepatitis C patients. A prospective, random- ized clinical trial conducted to evaluate the antifatigue and anti-inflam- matory effects of KRG in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease found a significant decrease in the serum levels of alanine aminotrans- ferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and proinflammatory cytokines in the KRG group compared with pla- cebo.128 The clinical indications of these hepatic actions of ginseng are quite broad and support its general tonic/adaptogen properties. Ginseng was also shown to increase nuclear RNA biosynthesis, indicating greater protein synthesis.3,115 Ginseng increased nuclear RNA synthesis ribosomal and messenger RNA, the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the activity of RNA polymerase.3,129-131 These results indicate that ginseng activates virtually every step in protein biosynthesis. Because protein synthesis is often reduced in the elderly, the significance of the effects on enhancement of hepatic pro- tein synthesis could be extremely high. However, results have yet to be confirmed by clinical studies.

## Radiation-Protecting Effects

Ginseng was shown to offer some protection against harmful radi- ation, both in vivo and in vitro, and to hasten recovery from radia- tion sickness.132,133 In the presence of ever-increasing environmental radiation contamination, ginseng may be an appropriate prophylactic against radiation exposure.

## Antidepressant and Anxiolytic Effects

As a traditional Chinese medicine, Panax notoginseng has a long his- tory of clinical value producing effects such as neuronal protection and inhibition of neuronal apoptosis. Research indicates that ginseng may also have antiinsomnia and antidepression effects, alleviate anxi- ety, and decrease neural network excitation. The main chemical com- ponents involved are Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). A thorough review study showed PNS and its components may exert these effects by promoting the release of neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine), modulation of gamma-amino butyric acid neuro- transmission, increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor by regu- lating multiple upstream neural signal transduction pathways in the CNS, and modulation of the HPA axis.134 Moreover, PNS exerted antidepressant-like effects and neuronal protection by regulating the release of interleukin-1 β , interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor- α , and anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, leading to the preservation of brain nerves. In an 8-week prospective study, 35 female outpatients aged 18 to 65 years (45.1 ± 9.5) who were remitted from major depression with residual symptoms were given KRG at doses of 3 g/day to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of KRG as an adjuvant treatment.135 The Depression Residual Symptom Scale (DRSS) and Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administrated to evaluate depressive symptoms. The general severity of symptoms was assessed by a clinician using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Severity (CGI-S), and the Depression and Somatic Symptom Scale (DSSS) was also used to evaluate somatic symptoms in the subjects. KRG treated individuals reported significant decrease in depressive symptoms on the DRSS, and MADRS decreased significantly over the 8-week period. The scores on the CGI-S, an objective measurement of symptoms, showed significant improvement in the severity of illness. Somatic symptoms on the DSSS also attenuated significantly during the study period. These results suggest that KRG is efficacious as an adjuvant treatment for patients experiencing residual symptoms of major depression.

## Antiobesity

In cultured adipocytes, animals, and humans, ginseng and its ginse- nosides may prevent/reduce obesity through several effects and mech- anisms. Ginseng and ginsenosides may affect appetite, food digestion and absorption, gut microbiota, inhibit fat tissue formation (adipo- genesis and angiogenensis), promote fat oxidation, improve leptin resistance, and promote energy expenditure (Fig. 99.7).136 The ade- nosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of cellular energy. Once activated, it switches on catabolic pathways generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) while switching off biosynthetic pathways consuming ATP. Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (PPAR- γ /C/EBP- α ) by ginseng contributes to its antiadipogenic effect, and through the activation of AMPK, metab- olism is switched from anabolism to catabolism. Furthermore, per- oxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR- α ) is activated downstream by AMPK and stimulates lipid oxidation and energy expenditure. The antiobesity effect of ginseng may come from both American ginseng and Asian ginseng, but most studies using whole extract/ juice in cultured cells, animals, and humans are from Asian ginseng. To investigate the effect of ginseng on gut microbiota, 10 obese middle-aged Korean women took Panax ginseng extracts (4 g/tab- let, 2 tablets/day) for 8 weeks and assessment of body composition parameters, metabolic biomarkers, and gut microbiota composition was performed at baseline and at 8 weeks.137 Significant changes were observed in body weight and body mass index; however, slight changes were observed in gut microbiota. The participants were then divided into two groups, the effective and the ineffective

## 766SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

weight loss groups, depending on weight loss effect, to determine whether the antiobesity effect was influenced by the composition of gut microbiota. The composition of gut microbiota was compared between the two groups. Before ginseng intake, significant differ- ences of gut microbiota were observed between both at phyla and genera levels. Results of this study indicate that ginseng exerted a weight loss effect and slight effects on gut microbiota in all partici- pants. In addition, its antiobesity effects differed depending on the composition of gut microbiota before ginseng intake. However, in another double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, KRG powder (6 g/person per day, 12 weeks) did not change the body weight, percent body fat, and insulin sensitivity of overweight and obese adults who did not have diabetes or hypertension.138 Interestingly, ginsenosides have a very low bioavailability after oral intake, and only the deglycosylated forms of ginsenosides can be absorbed into the circulatory system. The transformation of ginseno- sides is largely dependent on intestinal bacteria, which release various glycosidases to hydrolyze the sugar moieties of ginsenosides. Intestinal microflora varies among individuals, and approximately 20% of people cannot partially or fully transform ginsenosides.139 This may explain the differing results attained in human-based research. More clinical trials are required to confirm the antiobesity effect of ginseng and individual ginsenosides.

## Central Nervous System Effects

Animal models and cell cultures have demonstrated ginseng and its constituents produce beneficial effects on the CNS, includ- ing neuroprotection, improved cognition, and memory perfor- mance enhancement (Fig. 99.8). In models of neurodegenerative disorders, ginseng and ginsenosides have shown several benefits including140: • Decrease A β production and aggregation, increase A β clearance, decrease of tau hyperphosphorylation, and improve cholinergic function in Alzheimer’s disease • Protection against neurotoxic damage and inhibition of α -synu- clein aggregation in Parkinson’s disease • Protection against neurotoxic damage and inhibition of Ca2+ sig- naling in Huntington disease


The problem of quality control makes toxicology difficult to address. This is exemplified by a 1979 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled “Ginseng Abuse Syndrome.”141 In this Leptin Ghrelin

article, several side effects of commercial preparations of ginseng were reported, including: • Hypertension • Euphoria • Nervousness • Insomnia • Skin eruptions • Morning diarrhea Given the extreme variation in quality of ginseng in the American marketplace and the use of both nonofficial parts of the plant and adulterants, it is not surprising that side effects were noted. None of the commercial preparations used in the trial were subjected to con- trolled analysis. Furthermore, the species of ginseng used included P. ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, Eleutherococcus senticosus, and Rumex hymenosepalus in a variety of different forms—roots, capsules, tab- lets, teas, extracts, cigarettes, chewing gum, and candies. It is virtually impossible to derive any firm conclusions from the data presented in the JAMA article. An important caveat is that these ginseng abuse syn- drome effects are neither uniformly negative nor uniformly predict- able. Nevertheless, long-term ingestion of large amounts of ginseng should be avoided, as even a panacea can cause problems if abused. Studies performed on standardized extracts of ginseng demon- strated the absence of side effects and mutagenic or teratogenic effects.142-144 These studies differed markedly from the trial reported in JAMA, in that high-quality extracts were used. An extensive review of the safety of P. ginseng concluded, “Data from clinical trials suggest that the incidence of adverse events with ginseng monopreparations is similar to that with placebo.”141 In addition, a systematic review conducted to assess the safety of ginseng in randomized controlled clinical trials concluded that Panax ginseng showed a very safe profile with no statistical significance between ginseng and placebo groups on the frequency or symptoms of adverse events, and no serious or severe adverse events reported.145


The dosage of ginseng is inversely proportional to the ginsenoside con- tent; that is, if an extract or ginseng preparation contains high concen- trations of ginsenosides (and presumably other active components), a lower dose suffices. The standard dose for ginseng ranges between 4.5 to 6 g/day. Currently, there is almost a total lack of quality control in ginseng products marketed in the United States. Independent research and published studies clearly documented a tremendous variation in the ginsenoside content of commercial preparations. Many products on the market contain only trace amounts of ginsenosides, and some formulations contain no ginseng at all. This situation has led to sev- eral problems, ranging from toxicity reactions to lack of medicinal effect. The widespread disregard for quality control in the health food industry has done much to tarnish the reputation of ginseng as well as other important botanicals. We recommend the use of standardized ginseng preparations to ensure sufficient ginsenoside content, consistent therapeutic results, and reduced risk of toxicity. Products should be standardized in their ginsenoside content. The typical dose (taken one to three times daily) for general tonic effects should contain a saponin content of at least 5 mg of ginsenosides with a R b1 /R g1 ratio of 2:1. For example, for a high-quality ginseng root powder containing 5% ginsenosides, the dose would be 100 mg.144 Because each individual’s response to ginseng is unique, the patient should be monitored for signs of possible ginseng toxicity. It is best to begin at a lower dose and increase it gradually. The Russian approach for long-term administration is to use ginseng cyclically for a period of 15 to 20 days followed by a 2-week interval without any ginseng.


Taking ginseng preparations may increase the effectiveness of insulin and drugs that lower blood sugar levels such as glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase). It is important to discuss proper monitoring of blood sugar levels with patients who have diabetes before prescribing gin- seng. P. ginseng may potentiate the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine (Nardil) to produce manic-like symptoms.144 Ginseng may reduce the effectiveness of Coumadin (warfarin). In one double-blind study designed to evaluate the interactions between American ginseng and Coumadin (warfarin), 20 healthy volunteers received warfarin for 3 days during weeks 1 and 4.146 Beginning in week 2, patients were assigned to receive either American ginseng or placebo. The peak international normalized ratio statistically signifi- cantly decreased after 2 weeks of ginseng administration compared with placebo, with the difference between ginseng and placebo being zero. The international normalized ratio area under the curve, peak plasma warfarin level, and warfarin area under the curve were also statistically significantly reduced in the ginseng group compared with the placebo group. These results indicate a potential for ginseng reducing the effectiveness of warfarin. However, in a study in stroke patients, no interaction was noted.147 Korean ginseng and American ginseng have different ginsenoside profiles, and the heterogeneous composition of compounds among the types of ginseng might have led to different results. Until this interaction is further clarified, gin- seng should only be used with careful monitoring, if at all, in patients on Coumadin.

## 769CHAPTER 100 Pancreatic Enzymes

fractionated hydrolysate of beef pancreas, calf thymus, Pisum sativum (common pea), Lens esculenta (edible lentil), mannitol, and Carica papaya (papaya, a source of the enzyme papain). In the 1960s, Irving Innerfield conducted landmark research in the area of pancreatic enzymes, primarily relating to the clinical use of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pancreatin as well as streptokinase (a microbial proteolytic enzyme). Professor Heinrich Wrba, who for many years was head of the Austrian Cancer Research Institute at the University of Vienna, believed that enzyme therapy should be con- sidered a highly effective causal anticancer compound. Dr. Wrba’s interest in cancer was piqued when he lost a daughter to leukemia. He devoted his life to educating oncologists in Germany and around the world about enzyme therapy. It was the late Karl Ransberger, however, who continued and refined Wolf’s research, bringing it to doctors, hospitals, and patients through- out the world. Ransberger encouraged and funded research projects in numerous hospitals and universities in Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. His research, and that of others, validated enzyme therapy’s effectiveness in treating numerous conditions, including arthritis,2,3,4 cancer,5,6 multiple sclerosis,5–9 cardiovascular disease,6,10,11 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).12–14

# PANCREATIC ENZYME SUPPLEMENTS

The pancreatic enzyme supplements commonly used in health care are chymotrypsin, trypsin, pancrelipase, and pancreatin. Chymotrypsin and trypsin are proteolytic enzymes that break proteins into peptides. Chymotrypsin liberates the amino acids l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, and l-phenylalanine and other molecules, including several synthetic esters and amides.15 Trypsin hydrolyzes primarily lysyl and arginyl res- idues. Pancreatin contains amylase (which breaks down starch), lipase (which breaks down fats), and protease (which breaks down proteins). Pancrelipase is similar to pancreatin, but with a higher concentration of lipase. These enzymes are primarily obtained from hog or ox pancreas, but some (such as lipase) can also be obtained from microbial sources (e.g., Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae). Nevertheless, only enzymes isolated from animal pancreatic glands can be considered pancreatic enzymes. According to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), chymotrypsin and trypsin are routinely crystallized from ox pancreas gland extract, and pancreatin from both hog and ox sources, whereas pancrelipase is derived from hog pancreas. 16Porcine pancreas is especially rich in amylase and lipase and is similar to the human pancreas.15 Bovine pancreas contains considerable amounts of proteolytic enzymes but substantially lower amounts of lipase and amylase.15 Germany, Japan, England, India, and other countries use their own pharmaco- peia, and foreign companies may use other sources to formulate their enzyme products. Enzyme concentration and activity levels can vary depending on the age, sex, and species of pork or ox used to produce the supple- ment. For example, sow glands (from pork) are high in lipase, whereas butcher hogs (young male hogs, up to 90 kg in weight and 6 months of age) are high in protease. Beef cows and bulls have different enzyme levels from those in steers or heifers. Beef, although it provides all three basic enzyme types, does not exhibit the activity levels of pork (which has an activity level one-third to one-half higher). Furthermore, the physiology of hogs is more similar to that of humans than to that of any other animal. Enzymes extracted from animal sources are sensitive to envi- ronmental changes, so manufacturers take particular care during extraction to control pH (usually with buffers), temperature (using precooled solutions and apparatus), substrate, and proteolysis (con- trolled through the use of inhibitors) to render a product that is enzy- matically active.17

## Enzyme Standardization

In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requir- ing manufacturers of pancreatic enzyme products to test them in clin- ical trials if those products were prescribed to treat individuals with pancreatic diseases. Until that time, there were frequent inconsistencies in enzyme formulation. For example, a study of six different enzyme preparations found that, in some cases, the actual lipase activity in a product was more than twice that listed on the label.18 Another study on nine pancreatic enzyme products found that, although within USP limits, the percentage of lipase activity after dissolution was not always equal.19 These inconsistencies in content and activity level could unex- pectedly alter patient enzyme requirements. The FDA’s ruling ensures that pancreatic enzymes are standardized with a consistent activity level. Pancreatic enzymes marketed as dietary supplements, however, do not require testing or approval by the FDA. The requirements regarding activity level apply only to those pancre- atic enzyme products prescribed for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic pancreatitis, and other conditions.

# ABSORPTION OF PROTEINS

In the past, it was believed that the intestinal epithelial mucosa was impermeable to large protein molecules.20 However, research over the past several decades has shown that the intestinal epithelium can be crossed by macromolecules, including intact proteins such as proteo- lytic enzymes.21 These macromolecules normally penetrate the mucosal surface via the transcellular route because, in healthy mucosa, the tight junctions (zonula occludens) between the enterocytes prohibit paracellular pas- sage.22 Binding to the luminal membrane of the enterocyte is followed by phagocytosis.23 Some of the vacuole membrane vesicles formed fuse with lysosomes, and within the resulting phagolysome the pep- tides and proteins may be hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes.24 Other macromolecules avoid intracellular digestion and are passed from the enterocytes through the basolateral membrane into the interstitial space.25 In the interstitial space, the macromolecules become available to macrophages and lymphoid cells.26 Those molecules not taken up by macrophages or lymphatic cells eventually pass from the interstitial space into the blood or lymph.27 The exact level of the intestinal absorption of intact molecules or large breakdown products of dietary proteins is not yet totally clear and can vary by individual.28 Although it is generally assumed that, apart from a very small proportion, all protein is hydrolyzed into amino acids or low-molecular-weight peptides before absorption by the mucosa, some research supports the hypothesis that a considerable proportion of dietary protein is taken up in the form of macromole- cules and is only then hydrolyzed intercellularly in the peripheral tissue into amino acids (a process called distributed digestion).29

## Understanding the Absorption of Enzymes

Understanding the intestinal transport of macromolecules is especially important for understanding the functions and absorption of enzymes, specifically. Hydrolases, such as trypsin or elastase, can be transported functionally intact into the bloodstream from the lumen of the gut. These circulating proteinases are bound to antiproteinases, such as alpha 2 macroglobulin or alpha 1 antiproteinase,30 and can be resorbed

## 770SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

from the main bloodstream by pancreatic cells (enteropancreatic cir- culation as an enzyme conservation process).31 Thus the intestinal absorption of intact enzymes appears to be important for the balance between hydrolases and antiproteinases in the intracellular space32 and is an important factor for the establishment and maintenance of the internal stability in the body. Although there are a number of absorption mechanisms, the pri- mary mechanism for the enteral absorption of enzymes and other macromolecules is pinocytotic transfer by the M-cells of the small intestinal epithelium.33 The enzymes connect to a receptor in the intes- tinal wall mucosa and are then absorbed into the wall by pinocytosis, guided through the intestinal cells in vesicles, and finally released into the blood by exocytosis.33 To clarify the rate of absorption, Steffen et al.34 investigated the absorption of an enzyme mixture “A” (EMA), which contained 100 mg of pancreatin, 60 mg of papain, 10 mg of lipase, 10 mg of amylase, 24 mg of trypsin, 1 mg of chymotrypsin, 45 mg of bromelain, and 50 mg of the bioflavonoid rutin, in rabbits. Using electrophoresis, these researchers found that entire enzyme molecules were absorbed. Although enzyme particles were also present, the ratio to the entire amount administered was not measured. EMA was found in both the lungs and the liver after 1 to 2 hours. After 1 to 4 hours, approximately twice as much EMA was found in the liver as in the lungs. The absorption maximum in all animals occurred approximately 1 hour after administration. Within 6 hours, the absorption rate of orally ingested EMA was about 20%.35 After 24 hours, EMA was no longer found in either the lungs or the liver.

# FACTORS AFFECTING ENZYME ACTIVITY

Numerous factors, including pH, temperature, substrate (and sub- strate concentration), cofactors, metal ions, inhibitors, and coating, can affect the activity of supplemental enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Optimal pH Range

Each enzyme has an optimal pH range, depending on such variables as the temperature and substrate concentration at which the enzymatic catalytic reaction occurs most rapidly. Chymotrypsin has an optimum pH of 8.0, has reversible denaturation at a pH below 3.0, and becomes inactive at a pH above 9.0.15 Trypsin has an optimum pH between 7.0 and 9.0, is stable at a pH of 3.0 (and at low temperature), and is irre- versibly denatured at a pH of 9.0 or higher.15 The pH of the normal human stomach is 1.5 to 3.0,36 low enough to denature or inactivate some or all of a pancreatic enzyme supplement if it is not enterically coated or otherwise treated to protect it from a low-pH environment.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Effects of Temperature

In general, an increase of 18°F (10°C) in the enzymatic environment approximately doubles the rate of the chemical reaction.37 However, because enzymes are proteins, excessively high temperatures can dena- ture them, thus destroying their activity. The optimum temperature for an enzyme is the temperature at which the catalyzed enzymatic reaction progresses most rapidly without damage to the enzyme. This temperature can vary by enzyme. This is a good rationale for avoiding hot beverages when taking enzyme supplements. The enzymes in the human body develop high levels of activity at about body temperature, increasing to maximum at about the tem- perature of a severe fever, that is, 104°F (40°C).37

<!-- chunk -->

## Substrate Concentration

The rate of any reaction is accelerated by raising the substrate concen- tration until the enzyme is saturated by substrate. At this level, the rate of reaction becomes independent of substrate concentration and is no longer accelerated by the addition of more substrate. This is why it is particularly important to ingest sufficient quantities of supplemental enzymes (which vary according to the condition being treated).

<!-- chunk -->

## Cofactors

Although all enzymes consist of protein, some are complex proteins; that is, they have a protein component and a cofactor. If the cofactor is removed, the protein (no longer active enzymatically) is called the apoenzyme. A cofactor might be a metal (e.g., iron, magnesium, cop- per, or zinc), a prosthetic group (a moderately sized organic molecule), or a coenzyme (small organic compound). Prosthetic groups and met- als can aid in the catalytic function of the enzyme, whereas coenzymes take part in the enzymatic reaction. Many vitamins, trace elements, and minerals essential to human bodily function are part of enzymatic cofactors. Thus the physician must ensure that his or her patients take multivitamins and multiminerals to “feed” their enzymes. Coenzymes are essential for the activity of many enzymes and serve as a type of substrate in certain reactions. In these reactions, the coen- zyme is converted to a form no longer active in catalyzing the reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Metal Ions

Specific metal ions are required for the activity of many enzymes. Some metal ions increase enzyme activity, and others decrease or inhibit it. Calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybde- num, potassium, and zinc are the most common enzyme activators in humans. Certain heavy-metal ions inhibit enzyme reactions; they are barium, lead, and mercury, and they combine with the sulfhydryl reactive group (−SH) that is part of the active site of many enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Inhibitors

Ions, atoms, or molecules that terminate or retard enzyme activity are called inhibitors. They are classified as either noncompetitive or competitive. A noncompetitive inhibitor combines with the enzyme at a location other than the active site. The noncompetitive inhibitor retards the conversion of the substrate by the enzyme, although it does not affect the bonding of the substrate of the enzyme. An inhibitor is classified as competitive if it combines with the active site of the enzyme, preventing the substrate from having access to the active site.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplement Coating

The pH of the stomach’s hydrochloric acid secretions is about 0.8.1 This low pH inhibits bacterial growth and activates certain enzymes. This acidic nature, however, can destroy pH-sensitive supplemental enzymes. For this reason, many enzyme products are enterically coated. This coat- ing allows the product to reach the small intestine before disintegrating. Other products are encapsulated in “microspheres,” delaying disintegra- tion. For example, pancreatic protease encapsulated with a mixture of cel- lulose acetate phthalate and maize starch can remain stable in simulated gastric conditions (pH of 3.97) for at least 3 hours.38 This would theoret- ically provide enough time for the capsule to pass through each part of the gastrointestinal tract. The capsule then disintegrates rapidly under pH 6.82 and temperature of 39.5°C (as would occur in the small intestine).38 Nanotechnology is opening a new field for the delivery of enzymes and other small proteins. Nanotechnology is the study of matter as small as 1 billionth of a meter. According to the National Nanotechnology Initiative, nanoparticles are being used in timed-release drug delivery.39 Enzymes can be attached to nanoparticles and actually maneuvered to destroy diseased cells. Research on nondegradable nanocapsules showed that proteins can be efficiently transported to individual cells, surviving different pH levels.40 So, it is no wonder that enzymes (which are proteins) can also be attached to nanoparticles and used to treat disease at the cellular level.

# MEASURING ENZYME ACTIVITY

When considering enzymes and enzyme applications, the physi- cian must understand the variables affecting their performance. The selection of an enzyme for therapeutic purposes requires more than knowing whether a given product contains amylase, protease, lipase, or other enzymes. The activity levels of the enzymes are critical. As mentioned previously, the manufacturers of pancreatic enzymes prescribed to treat specific conditions must clearly disclose content and enzyme activity levels. Unfortunately, the same is not true of enzyme products sold as dietary supplements, whose labels may not indicate enzyme activity levels. In addition, even when the activity is stated, the consumer has no way of knowing which enzyme assay the manufac- turer used unless the label also indicates that the product conforms to the guidelines of the USP. This is particularly confusing because activ- ity levels are greatly affected by the conditions under which the assay was performed (including temperature, pH, and substrate). Adding to the confusion, enzyme manufacturers use diverse assay methodologies, making a direct comparison of competing products difficult, if not impossible. Using a single assay system (such as detailed in the USP) is necessary to directly compare competitive products. Several standardized assay systems are available for enzyme suppliers and are found in the USP (for a definitive assay), the NFIA Laboratory Methods Compendium, and the Food Chemical Codex. Incomplete labeling and the inconsistent use of standardized assay methodologies make evaluating competitive products extremely chal- lenging. Price could be the first indication of inequities in assay proce- dures. For example, if company A is selling a product at 1000 U/g for $30 a bottle, and company B is selling a product at 5000 U/g for $10 a bottle, the units are most likely not the same. For clinical reliability, one must use only appropriately labeled products or obtain the assay procedures from each of the manufactur- ers. If possible, competitor products should be compared by means of assays performed in an independent laboratory.


Historically, enzyme therapy has been used in a wide variety of appli- cations, ranging from oral supplementation to treat pancreatic insuffi- ciency to the centuries-old external application of enzymes to treat leg ulcers, topical wounds, wrinkles, blemishes, episiotomies, scars, and so on. Usually administered in capsules or tablets, enzymes are also avail- able as lozenges (dissolved in the mouth) or in powder form. Topical enzyme ointment is currently used to debride necrotic tissue and other wound debris. Enzymes can also be administered by injection (nor- mally in a hospital setting because of the risk of anaphylactic reaction) or rectally, by retention implant. Enzymes can be used individually but are typically more efficacious when used in combination with other enzymes. An enzyme combina- tion has numerous therapeutic advantages over a preparation with only one or two components. Combining enzymes from different sources— animal, plant, and fungi—results in a wider range of optimal pH, syn- ergism of the combined enzymes, greater absorption, higher level of efficacy, and broader range of application. For example, one German product contains an enzyme extract consisting of proteinases, triacyl- glycerol lipase, and alpha-glycosidase (amylase); minor amounts of elas- tase, nuclease, and carboxypeptidase; and calcium ions to boost activity. Dr. Peter Streichhan, a well-known enzyme researcher, stated that certain enzymatic mixtures have a broader range of action than pan- creatin, bromelain, or any other standardized monohydrolytic prepara- tion—this is because certain enzyme mixtures characteristically possess differences in optimal pH and also differences in reactive properties of the proteolytic, lipolytic, and/or amylolytic-acting hydrolases.41 It should be remembered that at the beginning of therapy, an indi- vidual’s symptoms may occasionally become more severe. This is a sign that a therapeutic reaction is occurring and should be evaluated positively. The medication does not need to be discontinued, although a temporary reduction in dose might be advisable. Clinical uses of individual enzymes can be found in Boxes 100.1 through 100.5, whereas clinical uses of combinations can be found in Box 100.6. For more information on how enzymes can treat more than 150 conditions, please see the author’s book, The Complete Book of Enzyme Therapy. Most conditions treated by enzymes can be assigned to one or more of the following categories: • Digestive conditions • Inflammatory conditions • Cancer

## Digestive Disorders

Supplementing the diet with pancreatic enzymes can improve food digestion and therefore nutrient assimilation. This is especially true if the body’s own pancreatic enzyme production and/or supply is deficient, as can occur with age or because of an underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic pancreatitis, pancre- atic insufficiency, steatorrhea, biliary tract disease, or celiac disease. Pancreatic enzymes have a long history of use in treating those condi- tions, as well as indigestion, heartburn, gas, diarrhea, constipation— the list seems endless. Patients with CF are routinely prescribed pancreatin or pancrelipase capsules containing enterically coated beads. A hereditary disease, CF involves a disorder of the exocrine glands and causes the production of thick mucus, which leads to obstructions in various glands and ducts in the body. When the mucus affects the lungs, it leads to severe cough- ing and repeated lung infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. When the mucus obstructs the pancreatic duct, it prevents the enzyme- rich pancreatic juice from reaching the intestine, negatively affecting food digestion and nutrient absorption. This can result in malnutrition, weight loss, steatorrhea (fatty stools), or intestinal obstruction. Poor digestion affects approximately 90% of all CF patients.42 Although critical for proper digestion in those with CF, enzyme supplementation can also improve digestion and nutrient absorption in those with chronic pancreatitis, a condition marked by weight loss, steatorrhea, and abdominal pain and swelling. By improving nutrient absorption, enzymes can improve serum albumin levels (low levels reflect protein-calorie malnutrition),43 improve steatorrhea,44 and, thereby, increase weight gain43 in these subjects. Even healthy individuals can benefit from taking enzymes because enzyme supplementation can improve the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. For example, a study on healthy individuals found that ingesting an acid-resistant lipase supplement immediately after eating a high-fat meal (comprising 55% fat) reduced the feeling of stomach fullness that typically follows such a meal.45

## Inflammatory Diseases and Conditions

The inflammatory process is involved in numerous diseases and condi- tions, from sports injuries to arthritis to sinusitis to fibrositis. Whenever an injury or infection (regardless of the cause) occurs, a number of repair mechanisms are activated, resulting in microthrombi and fibrin surrounding the traumatized region. The fibrin web cuts off normal circulation, resulting in stasis and inhibiting the repair process (nutri- ents cannot get into the damaged area, and waste products cannot be removed). This, in turn, leads to increased pressure in the capillaries, causing fluid to be forced out into the surrounding tissue, resulting in swelling and pain. Supplemental enzymes, after absorption, circulate through the bloodstream to the affected area and have been shown to reduce several of the proinflammatory cytokines while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines.46 The enzymes attack the microclots and fibrin formation, effectively lysing the fibrin, breaking open the clogged vessels, and reestablishing circulation. The resulting restoration of nor- mal blood flow leads to a faster resolution of postinflammatory pain and edema. Equally important, the essential physiological inflammatory repair process is not blocked or diminished (as with anti-inflammatory agents), but rather is accelerated and reinforced. In a Canadian study, postal workers with rotator cuff tendonitis were treated with either naturopathic care (NC), which included

## 773CHAPTER 100 Pancreatic Enzymes

dietary counseling, acupuncture, and an enzyme supplement (con- taining bromelain, trypsin, and rutin), or with physical exercise (PE), which included exercise and placebo.47 Those participants on the NC therapy saw a decrease in their shoulder pain and disability of over 54% (as measured by Shoulder Pain and Disability Index) compared with 18% in the PE group. The NC group also had significant improve- ment in range of motion compared with the PE group.47 Fractures often require surgery to repair the broken bone. Czech researchers followed the progress of 60 patients after surgery for repair of long-bone fractures. Thirty patients received an enzyme mixture (containing trypsin, bromelain, and rutin), whereas another 30 patients were treated by standard antiedema drugs. Both groups received the same pain medicine. The group that received the enzyme mixture had a significantly faster reduction in posttraumatic and post- operative swelling. In addition, those taking enzymes consumed sig- nificantly fewer painkillers.48 A similar study in Russia using an enzyme mixture on children with fractured long bones found that swelling and pain subsided twice as fast in the enzyme group as in the group receiving traditional therapy.49 Intense exercise can lead to soft tissue injury, inflammation, and muscle soreness. Researchers found that supplementing with pro- tease mixtures could help ease muscle soreness and assist muscle healing after exercise.50 A similar study51 conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the effect of systemic enzyme therapy on exercise-induced inflammation.51 Compared with placebo, the enzyme therapy was superior in reducing biomarkers of inflammation in all study subjects. Even inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis52 and herpes zos- ter,53 were shown to respond to the systemic application of enzymes. A double-blind, randomized study compared an oral enzyme mixture (containing trypsin, bromelain, and the bioflavonoid, rutin) with diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug frequently pre- scribed for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis).54 Ninety patients received either the enzyme mixture or the diclofenac for a 6-week period. Results indicated that the enzyme mixture was just as effective as diclofenac. A similar study on 150 patients with moderate to severe knee osteo- arthritis compared the effect of an enzyme combination (containing trypsin, bromelain, and rutin) with that of diclofenac.55 Those patients taking the enzyme combination experienced a significant improve- ment in joint pain, function, and joint flexibility. According to the researchers, the enzyme treatment was as effective as diclofenac with fewer potential side effects. Individual enzymes and enzyme combinations (particularly those including trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, amylase, lipase, papain, and bromelain, with rutin) are effective in treating inflammation because they help limit the injury, aid its rectification, and promote new, healthy tissue formation. Enzymes effectively accelerate the inflamma- tory process (a necessary component of wound healing). This accelera- tion means, on the one hand, that the work of damage control, damage repair, and new tissue construction is carried out more actively, and thus completed more swiftly. On the other hand, it means that there can be a temporary increase in the visual and sensory effects produced by the inflammation (i.e., more redness, swelling, heat, and pain). Despite the supportive research, the administration of enzymes in traumatology and injuries is not widely used in the United States, which is in contrast to Europe, where all types of injuries—sprains, strains, hematomas, dislocations, and even postoperative conditions— are effectively treated with enzymes. Although the inflammatory pro- cess is involved in viral and bacterial infections, those disorders are covered in the “Viral and Bacterial Disorders” section within this chapter.


Just as Beard researched the effects of enzymes on cancer, so have mod- ern researchers. Dr. William Kelley devised an anticancer program that employed detoxification, pancreatic enzymes (and other nutritional supplements), improved enzyme-rich nutrition, and coffee enemas.56 He initiated his treatment program in response to his own bout with pancreatic cancer. Building on Kelley’s research, Dr. Nicholas Gonzales treated various types of cancer with diet, nutritional supplements, and detoxification methods. Many physicians around the world use sys- temic enzyme therapy to treat cancer; however, it remains a controver- sial therapy. Widely accepted, however, is the practice of using enzyme therapy to treat the side effects of cancer and cancer treatment. Standard cancer therapy can often result in serious side effects. For instance, radiation therapy of the head and neck is often accompanied by acute side effects, including difficulty swallowing, mucous mem- brane inflammation, and skin redness or soreness. Oral enzyme prepa- rations seem to protect against these acute side effects, reducing their severity and duration.57 A study on patients with laryngeal cancer receiving radiation treat- ment found that those patients receiving an enzyme mixture (contain- ing trypsin, bromelain, and rutin) had no cases of radiomucositis of the second degree and were able to continue on the radiation ther- apy.58 Researchers also noted that those on enzyme therapy had a mean weight loss of only 5% compared with 10% in the control group. In another study, researchers tested an enzyme combination in patients who underwent radiation therapy for cervical cancer.59 Radiation therapy can cause numerous side effects, including bladder irritation, loose bowels, nausea, vomiting, and vaginal dryness. Results indicated that patients who received the enzyme mixture (which con- tained trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain) had a significant reduction in vaginal mucosa reactions, genitourinary symptoms, and subcutane- ous changes.59 Researchers in another study on patients with lung cancer who underwent chemotherapy found that an enzyme mixture containing papain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and thymic peptides reduced the inci- dence of leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, sensory neuropathy, and treat- ment-related depression.60

## Breast Cancer

It is estimated that one of every eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer sometime during her life.61 Unfortunately, standard treatment (which can include radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery) can cause serious side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pain, skin disorders, and infections. Researchers in Germany evaluated whether treatment with oral enzymes could reduce some of the typical side effects of breast cancer therapy.62 They found that 74% of the enzyme group experienced a clear reduction in chemother- apy and radiotherapy side effects and that oral enzyme therapy could improve disease signs and symptoms, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life.62

## Lymphedema

Treatment for breast cancer can sometimes lead to lymphedema (swelling caused by a buildup of lymph). This typically occurs after a lymph node is removed or after radiation treatment and can develop slowly. Symptoms include swelling in the arm, hand, shoulder, chest, or breast and may be accompanied by changes in skin texture, aching, and restricted mobility. Typical medical therapy for lymphedema includes massage, exer- cising, special bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage, and the use of diuretic therapy. One clinical trial compared therapy with enzymes

(the product contained pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, chy- motrypsin, and rutosid) with a diuretic.63 After 7 weeks, significantly more of the patients receiving enzymes were pain-free compared with

## Pancreatic Cancer

It is estimated that pancreatic cancer will kill more than 43,000 in the United States this year alone.64 In the past, survival rates for this disease were extremely low because treatment options were lim- ited, and diagnosis usually did not occur until the disease was quite advanced. However, treatment improvements and earlier diagnosis have dramatically improved survival rates.65 The standard medical treatment for pancreatic cancer involves surgery, radiation ther- apy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (also called biological therapy). Pancreatic cancer can block the pancreatic duct and prevent enzymes from reaching the small intestine, resulting in malnutrition and weight loss. It is estimated that 80% to 90% of all patients with pan- creatic cancer have malabsorption and weight loss.66 Supplementing with pancreatic enzymes is an important supportive step in treating pancreatic cancer because it can improve digestion and therefore nutrient absorption.67,44,68

## Autoimmune and Immune Complex–Mediated Diseases

In autoimmune disease, tissue-bound immune complexes activate the complement system. Activation of the enzyme cascade results in an intense protein-destroying inflammatory response, leading to signif- icant local tissue destruction. For instance, when immune complexes collect in the kidneys, complement activation causes inflammation, resulting in glomerulonephritis. Research showed that some enzymes can inhibit immune complex– mediated diseases, such as glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthri- tis,2,3,4,52,69 by interrupting the complement cascade. Other disorders with similar mechanisms also respond to supplemental enzymes. Some are conditions such as Crohn’s disease,2,6,9,70 chronic rheumatism,71,72 and ankylosing spondylitis,73–76 which do not respond well to conven- tional medical treatments.

## Multiple Sclerosis

According to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, there may be as many as 1 million Americans living with multiple sclerosis (MS).77 Unfortunately, the government does not track MS cases, so the fre- quency can only be estimated. Although its cause is unknown, it is gen- erally believed to be an autoimmune disease. In MS, antibodies attack the myelin sheath that protects and covers nerve fibers. This leads to inflammation and myelin sheath damage, which in turn interferes with nerve communications. MS patients typically have higher concentrations of circulating immune complexes (CICs) than healthy individuals. Research showed that enzyme therapy can help reduce those CICs and thereby reduce inflammation.78 A Ukrainian study on an enzyme combination containing trypsin, bromelain, and rutin found that patients with MS taking the combi- nation for 1 to 3 years had fewer and less severe complications and longer remissions and also experienced a slowing of their disease progression.79

## Cardiovascular Disorders

Cardiovascular disorders include diseases of the heart and blood ves- sels (including strokes). In the United States, heart disease and stroke kill nearly three-quarters of a million people every year and account for nearly one third of all deaths.80 In normal circulation, there is a constant dynamic balance between blood clotting and fibrinolysis.81 If fibrinolysis is impaired, clot for- mation is abnormal. If fibrinolysis increases, a tendency toward exces- sive bleeding results. Therefore maintenance of proper equilibrium is extremely important for the circulatory system. One study examined the effects of various enzyme combinations on fibrinolysis and fibrin formation.6 The researchers induced fibrin deposition with calcium ions or staphylocoagulase in the plasma of centrifuged, acellular citrated blood from humans or rabbits and treated the clot with various concentrations of enzyme suspensions. They found that the higher the enzyme content of the solution, the more rapidly clots were degraded. Inflammation is considered to play a central role in all atherosclerotic processes. Therefore the use of enzymes is indicated because of their anti-inflammatory effect. A German study measured the effects of a proteolytic enzyme com- bination (containing trypsin, bromelain, and rutin) on blood fluidity.10 Researchers found that even a minimum enzyme concentration resulted in a significant reduction in plasma viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation. Systemic enzyme therapy appears to be particularly effective in the treatment of phlebitis and thrombophlebitis,11 as well as chronic venous insufficiency (also called postphlebitic syndrome), which can occur because of phlebitis. In one study, treatment with systemic enzyme therapy led to a decrease in several symptoms, including pain, edema, and trophic ulcers.82

## Viral and Bacterial Disorders

Enzymes have been used to treat many viral and bacterial conditions, including abscesses, acne, adenoiditis, adnexitis, bladder infection, boils, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, ear infections, empyemas, epididymitis, gingivitis, kidney disorders, laryngitis, pneumonia, rheumatic fever, sinusitis, staphylococcal infection, tonsillitis, and sepsis. Sepsis is a particularly dangerous systemic response to infection. Researchers in India found that proteolytic enzyme therapy improved recovery time in children with sepsis.83 Thirty young boys (ages month to 12 years) with sepsis were given proteolytic enzymes. Another group of 30 boys received placebo tablets. Both groups received sup- portive treatment and the appropriate antibiotics. Fever subsided faster in the enzyme group (3 days) than in the placebo group (4 days), and those in the enzyme group were able to begin oral feeding in 4 days as opposed to 5 days in the placebo group. In addition, hemodynamic support was only needed for 2 days in the enzyme group (as opposed to 3 days in the placebo group), and the modified Glasgow Coma Scale normalized for enzyme participants in 3 days (as opposed to 5.5 days in the placebo group).83 As more and more bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, researchers and physicians are investigating supportive treatments, including systemic enzyme therapy. As mentioned previously, enzymes not only reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and stimulate and balance immune system function, but they are also able to enhance the ability of antibiotics when their use is required.84,83 Enzymes fortify the action of antibiotics, leading to complete healing and preventing the progression of an acute infection into its chronic form. A good exam- ple is urogenital chlamydiosis, which is a sexually transmitted disease and a major cause of infertility. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 1 million cases reported in the United States in 2008. By 2016 that number had increased to 1½ million cases.85 Standard treatment is with antibiotics, including azithromycin or doxycycline. Although antibiotic treatment appears to be highly efficacious, in some individuals the infection becomes per- sistent and chronic, leading to long-term disorders in females, includ- ing pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and sterility.86 A Russian study of 227 patients with urogenital chlamydiosis found

<!-- chunk -->

## 775CHAPTER 100 Pancreatic Enzymes

that treatment with antibiotics led to complete recovery in only 61.4% of patients, whereas enzyme therapy in conjunction with antibiotics resulted in over 90% treatment success.84 In addition to its use in treating bacterial infections, enzyme ther- apy can also aid in the treatment of viruses, including HIV, chancre sores, chickenpox, colds and coughs, hepatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, influenza, measles, pneumonia (viral), and warts. The human body defends against these, and other, viruses with the help of macro- phages or natural killer (NK) cells. Oral enzyme combinations (e.g., papain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin) synergistically increase the antivi- ral effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), macrophages, and NK cells and the breakdown of CICs.


Regardless of the condition being treated, a wide range in daily dosage has historically been used for the following reasons: • There are individual differences in patient health. • The level of effective absorption in tablet strength can vary. • There is a wide variety of influencing ranges in pH. • Enzyme activity levels vary between products. The dosage of any pancreatic enzyme will depend on the condi- tion being treated, the patient’s diet and digestive requirements, and the composition and activity level of the supplement. Dosage can also vary because of the supplement’s susceptibility to inactivation in the stomach and duodenum. For best results, follow the label for dosage recommendations.


In general, the side effects of orally administered enzymes are few, short term, and due primarily to higher dosages or hypersensitivity reactions. According to Wolf and Ransberger, high dosages (70 tab- lets of 17.5 g each) of a proteolytic enzyme mixture have been given without long-term side effects.87 Studies and literature searches com- missioned by regulatory authorities such as the FDA apparently con- firmed that enzyme preparations obtained from suitable sources (e.g., nontoxic, nonpathogenic sources) are safe to consume.88 The potential side effects of pancreatic enzyme therapy include diarrhea; intestinal gas; abdominal pain or cramping; and greasy, pale, or pungent stools. Reducing the dose can usually reduce or eliminate these side effects. Hyperuricosuria (excess uric acid in the urine) and hyperuricemia (excess uric acid in the blood) have been associated with extremely high doses. Sneezing, lacrimation, rash, and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in sensitive individuals. Pancreatin preparations held in the mouth or chewed before swal- lowing can result in stomatitis, or ulcerations and irritation of the mucosa, particularly in infants, in whom pancreatin may also cause perianal soreness.89 However, some of the capsules containing micro- encapsulated enzyme beads can be opened and dispensed by the spoonful to infants or mixed into foods such as apple sauce or gelatin. Prolonged skin contact with proteolytic enzymes (i.e., in ointment form) may cause skin irritation, whereas enzyme enemas can some- times cause itching or burning in the rectum or anus. Care should be exercised when using powdered enzymes or enzyme capsules to avoid inhaling dust particles, which could irritate the mucous membranes of the throat, nose, and eyes.88 In addition, inhalation may trigger an asthma attack.90 It is not known whether pancreatin or pancrelipase given to preg- nant women can harm the fetus because animal reproductive studies have not been conducted. Therefore pancreatin should not be used during pregnancy.89 Also, it is not known if pancreatin or pancrelipase is distributed into a mother’s milk. Therefore caution should be exer- cised with the use of this substance in nursing women.89 Enzymes should not be used by those with hemophilia or those on blood thinners (unless under a physician’s care), nor immediately before or after surgical procedures with an increased risk of bleeding. Enzymes should also be avoided by those with pulmonary emphysema or thrombocytopenia. Pancrelipase (and any other enzyme derived from pork sources) is contraindicated in those who are hypersensitive or allergic to pork products. There is some indication that patients with CF who are undergo- ing long-term high-dose pancreatic enzyme therapy may demonstrate colonic wall thickening, a condition called fibrosing colonopathy (FCP). It was once believed that the copolymer coating on the tab- lets might be the culprit,91 and there have been instances of FCP in CF patients not taking any type of enzyme preparation.92 However, it is generally believed that FCP occurs because of prolonged treatment with very high doses of pancreatic enzymes.93 Many of the individuals who were first diagnosed with FCP were taking tens of thousands of units in excess of label recommendations.94 To reduce the risk of FCP, it is extremely important that patients closely follow their physicians’ recommendations regarding dosage. A note about supplement safety: During the past few decades, there has been increased concern regarding mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE]). Called Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, it can be caused by eating beef that is infected with BSE, but it can also be transmitted through corneal transplant tissue, from hormone extracts (e.g., human growth hormone), and possi- bly from ingesting contaminated glandular products. Unfortunately, it may take as long as 20 years after infection for the characteris- tic symptoms of CJD to manifest. Since 1995, the FDA has required that dietary supplement manufacturers ensure that any “high-risk” animal products used in their supplements do not originate in BSE countries, in countries with inadequate surveillance, or in countries with requirements less strict than those that would be acceptable for importation into the United States. The list is constantly updated; for the most current list of BSE countries, refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service website (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/ animal-and-animal-product-import-information/import- live-animals/ct_bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy). Contact the supplement manufacturer for concerns about pancreatic supple- ment safety or to see what measures they employ to ensure BSE-free products.


In addition to lipases and amylases, pancreatic enzymes contain prote- ases, so they are subject to some of the same drug interaction warnings as is bromelain (see Chapter 59 on bromelain). As with bromelain, caution should be exercised when pancreatic enzymes are used with anticoagulants (blood thinners), as well as over-the-counter nonste- roidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin and ibuprofen. In addition, certain botanicals, including garlic, gingko biloba, and gin- seng, may increase bleeding risk and so should be monitored when used in conjunction with pancreatic enzymes. Certain diabetes drugs, such as acarbose (brand names Glyset and Precose), function as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, lowering blood sugar levels by inhibiting the digestion of dietary carbohydrates. This, in turn, limits the rise of blood sugar levels. However, the amylase in pancreatic enzymes has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors because amylase improves carbohydrate

digestion. Therefore pancreatic enzymes should not be taken concom- itantly with acarbose and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Similarly, drugs that function as lipase inhibitors (e.g., Orlistat) should be avoided while taking pancreatic enzymes. Orlistat is avail- able in prescription (as Xenical) and nonprescription (as Alli) forms. It functions by inhibiting lipase in both the lumen of the stomach and the small intestine. Although there are no known studies on Orlistat given concomitantly with pancreatic enzymes, it would seem counter- productive to take a drug designed to inhibit lipase activity while also taking a drug containing lipase. In addition, because Orlistat inhib- its the activity of lipase, it may interfere with the action of pancreatic enzymes. Any foods that contain enzyme inhibitors have the potential to decrease the activity of pancreatic enzymes. Heat inactivates enzyme inhibitors (such as those found in potatoes, legumes, and soybeans, which are rarely eaten raw).


As we can see, the use of pancreatic enzymes has been found to be extremely effective in treating a wide variety of conditions, from diges- tive diseases to inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, viral and bacterial conditions, and more. It is my firm belief that future research will not only continue to validate but will also reveal new and exciting applications for systemic enzyme therapy. This chapter is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Max Wolf, the father of systemic enzyme therapy, as well as Dr. Karl Ransberger, who validated and marketed systemic enzyme therapy, making it a highly accepted worldwide treatment for a wide variety of systemic diseases and injuries.

foundation for growing interest today in its possibilities. The hope is that this modality will soon be more readily available for external appli- cations, while physicians and researchers occasionally take advantage of “Compassionate Use” guidelines and deal with the challenges of get- ting funding for full-scale clinical trials of more invasive approaches. Here, we explore available data that strongly support expedited evalu- ation of phage therapy to help address the serious menace of antibiotic resistant bacteria.6-18 Extensively documented results of early French and Eastern European therapeutic phage applications are very encouraging, but most involved individualized applications to infections recalcitrant to all other available treatments, not double-blind clinical trials. There have been encouraging developments. In 2006 the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) both approved phage prepara- tions targeting Listeria monocytogenes on ready-to-eat foods. Intralytix (Baltimore, Maryland) in the United States now markets similar products targeting E. coli O157, other pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella (PLSV-1) and Clostridium perfringens (INT-401) in poultry, or a wide range of pathogenic Salmonella serotypes on food: Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Newport, Hadar, Kentucky, Thompson, Georgia, Agona, Grampian, Senftenberg, Alachua, Infantis, Reading, and Schwarzengrund. SalmoFresh is specifically designed for treating foods that are at high risk for Salmonella contamination. Red meat and poultry can be treated before grinding for significant reductions in Salmonella contamination. SalmoFresh received Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) recognition from the FDA in 2013 (GRAS Notice No. GRN 000435), for direct applications onto poultry, fish and shellfish, and fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. Designing and successfully carrying out successful double-blind trials has been very challenging; safety has been established, but dif- ficulties involving design have made proof of efficacy unavailable. For example, the Nestlé corporation carried out an extensive project in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to study the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in treating infant diarrhea believed to have been caused by E. coli.19 Either a novel cocktail of T4-like phages used in earlier safety trials, a commercially available Russian anti-E. coli phage cocktail (Microgen), or a placebo were added in blinded fashion to standard oral rehydra- tion solution. The phages being used for the main experimental arm of the trial had been isolated from the stools of pediatric diarrhea patients in Bangladesh, with the broad-spectrum ones applicable for phage therapy all turning out to be members of the highly studied T4 family of phages, described in the following section.20 They also reported the details of their very extensive genomic, mouse, and human safety stud- ies of representative phages from their set.21 The trial very effectively established safety. However, for several technical reasons that are now much clearer, despite the enormous expense, it was unable to estab- lish efficacy. Apparently, the true culprits were, at least partly, a pair of previously unknown streptococci. Also, as our laboratory established at about that time, T4-infected stationary-phase E. coli goes into a sort of hibernation-mode state, killing the bacteria but not completing the cycle, and releasing a large burst of phages until glucose and amino acids are added, as much as 48 hours later (Bryan et al., 2016).5

# PROPERTIES OF BACTERIOPHAGES

Bacteriophages, like other viral particles, are like spaceships that can transfer their genomes into susceptible cells where they can reproduce. In the case of bacteriophages, the targets are bacterial cells, specific to varying degrees for each phage; they cannot infect the cells of eukary- otic organisms. Each virion consists of DNA or RNA, containing the information that determines the properties of the virus, which is encased in a protein coat (Fig. 101.1). Unlike eukaryotic viruses, most DNA phages have tails, the tips of which can bind to specific molecules on the surfaces of their target bacteria (Fig. 101.2). Many have 4 to tail fibers that initiate the bacterial recognition process and help the virion position itself in a manner facilitating the injection of its DNA into the cell. Once in the cell, the DNA is replicated, creating numerous copies of the entire virion. At human body temperature, many phages produce more than 100 virions per cell in about half an hour while for phages targeting oceanic bacteria, for example, that process may take 24 hours. Each strain of bacteria has characteristic protein, carbohydrate, and lipopolysaccharide molecules present in very large quantities on its surface. These molecules are involved in forming pores, conferring motility, and binding of the bacteria to particular surfaces. Each such molecule can act as a receptor for particular phages. Development of resistance to a particular phage generally reflects mutational alteration or loss of its specific receptor; this loss frequently has negative effects on the bacterium, often making such mutants less virulent, and does not confer protection against the many other phages that use different receptors. Each kind of bacterium has its own phages, which can gener- ally be isolated wherever that bacterium grows: from sewage, feces, soil, and even ocean depths or hot springs. However, finding phages suit- able for therapeutic applications is much easier for some species than for others; this relates significantly to the ability to grow the host bac- terium in the laboratory. The process of isolation is straightforward for

phages targeting many of the best-studied pathogens. An environmen- tal sample is combined with an appropriate nutrient-fortified solution and one or more kinds of targeted bacteria, incubated overnight, and lysed with chloroform. A series of tenfold dilutions is made and μ L of each dilution is spotted on a nutrient-agar plate prepared with a sin- gle strain of target bacteria. The next day, a dense bacterial lawn is seen, hopefully with cleared spots at each dilution, until small, clear individ- ual plaques are seen. Each plaque contains over a million phages, all of them progeny of a single initial phage. An individual plaque is plucked from that furthest dilution and put through a redilution to a concen- tration giving about 10 to 30 plaques. Finally, one plaque is picked and grown up in an appropriate host to give a stock of a phage whose host range, purity, and other properties can then be studied. One major source of confusion in the early phage work was that each laboratory isolated its own new phages, often infecting different bacteria, so there was little continuity or basis for comparison. Key technical developments in the 1930s to 1940s that helped clarify the general nature and properties of bacteriophages were (1) the concen- tration and purification of a few large phages using the newly available high-speed centrifugation and the demonstration that they contained roughly equal amounts of DNA and protein; and (2) visualization of phages by the newly developed electron microscopes (EM).22,23 Phages specific for virtually every well-studied bacterial species have now been isolated and studied in substantial detail in laboratories all over the world. Many are becoming well classified. The early EM work helped resolve the major disputed question as to whether the lytic principle termed “bacteriophage” simply reflected an inherent property of the specific bacteria, as strongly proposed by eminent immunologist Jules Bordet, 1919 winner of a Nobel Prize, or required regular reinfection by an external agent, as indicated by d’Hérelle’s research (see “Historical Context of Phage Therapy”). During the 1930s and 1940s, it gradually became clear that in some senses both were true—that there were two quite fundamentally dif- ferent groups of bacteriophages. Obligatorily lytic phages always have to infect from outside, reprogram the host cell, and release a burst of phage through breaking open or lysing the cell after a relatively short fixed interval. Temperate phages, in contrast, have another option; they can actually integrate their DNA into the host DNA, much as HIV can integrate the DNA copy of its RNA. For several reasons, such tem- perate phages are not appropriate for therapeutic applications. They generally make the host resistant to related phages, blocking treatment efficacy, and may carry genes that actually increase the pathogenicity of the host; very specific prophages are a key factor in such diseases as cholera and diphtheria. Using the EM, each phage family was found to have its own specific shape and size, from “lunar lander”–style complexity with a contractile tail and long tail fibers attached to a baseplate, to globular heads with long or short tails, to the small filamentous phages that looked much like bacterial pili (Fig. 101.3). With recent advances in DNA sequenc- ing techniques, our understanding of various phages is exploding in powerful and important ways; the genomes of several hundred phages, infecting a variety of organisms, have now been sequenced, revealing a remarkable variety of types and properties that can be very import- ant when considering potential therapeutic applications. In general appearance, 95% of the studied phages belong to one of the three- tailed morphotypes: the short-tailed podoviridae, the siphoviridae with long, often flexible tails, and the myoviridae, with tails composed of an inner tube and an outer contractile sheath attached to a complex baseplate. There are both obligatorily lytic and temperate phage fam- ilies with each of these three general morphotypes, so other kinds of data are also needed to determine whether a newly isolated phage is temperate or lytic.

## of Molecular Biology

A much better understanding of the interactions between the lytic life cycle of phages and bacteria began with one-step growth curve exper- iments. These demonstrated an eclipse period, during which the DNA began replicating and there were no free phages in the cell; a latent period of accumulation of intracellular phages; and a precisely timed lysis process that released the phage to go in search of new hosts. This phage infection cycle is illustrated in Fig. 101.4 for coliphage T4, which does a particularly effective job of shutting off all host functions and whose family is very widespread in nature and in therapeutic phage preparations for enteric bacteria. In 1943 an event occurred that had a major effect on the orientation of phage research in the United States and much of western Europe, strongly shifting the emphasis from practical applications to basic sci- ence. Physicist-turned–phage biologist Max Delbruck met with Alfred Hershey and Salvador Luria to form a “Phage Group” and establish a long-lasting annual phage course and meeting at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island. A major element of the success of phages as model systems for working out fundamental biological principles at the molecular level was that Delbruck persuaded most US phage biologists to focus on one bacterial host (E. coli B) and seven of its highly lytic phages, arbitrarily named types T1 through T7. Fortuitously, T2, T4, and T6 are quite similar to one another, defining a family of myoviridae now called the T-even phages, which were key in demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material, that viruses can encode enzymes, that gene expression is medi- ated through special “messenger RNA,” that the genetic code is triplet in nature, and other fundamental concepts. The negative side of this focus on a few phages growing on one host under rich laboratory conditions was that there was very little study or awareness of the ranges, roles, and properties of bacteriophages in the natural environment or of poten- tial applications. On the positive side, most of the strongly lytic phages selected for therapeutic applications targeting enteric phages have turned out to belong to one or another of these three very well-studied families of phages (as confirmed by sequencing data as well as morpho- logical details), which is very useful as we work to ensure their safety and to understand the physiological properties involved.

The temperate phages generally encode repressors to turn off most of their own genes when they are in the temperate prophage state, integrases to let them insert themselves into the DNA of their hosts, and excision enzymes to cut their DNA back out to enter a lytic cycle. Obligately lytic phages generally have much more extensive mecha- nisms for shutting off the host, often involving nucleases and tran- scription factors and a variety of small host-lethal “monkey-wrench” proteins made under the control of strong promoters very early in infection to redirect cellular metabolism; T4, for example, encodes at least 50 such proteins (Miller et al., 2003).105

# HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF PHAGE THERAPY

Edward Twort and Félix d’Hérelle independently reported the iso- lation of filterable entities capable of lysing bacterial cultures. When diluted sufficiently, they made small round cleared areas d’Herelle called “plaques” on plates of bacterial cultures, implying that discrete particles were involved. It was d’Hérelle, a Canadian working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who gave the name bacteriophage to these entities, which he discovered in the stools of soldiers recovering from dysentery—using the suffix phage “not in its strict sense of to eat, but in that of developing at the expense of.”24 He soon also isolated phages targeting avian typhosis and tested their application during an out- break in French chickens, showing that three-quarters of the untreated chickens died, whereas all of the phage-treated infected chickens sur- vived. He then accepted an urgent request to treat several children battling dysentery at the Paris Hôpital des Enfantes Malades; the day before treating the first child, he and several assistants swallowed far more phages than they would be administering, thus carrying out the first known Phase I clinical trial. The treatment of the children was fully successful, but d’Hérelle turned to intense study of the nature of bacterial infection by phages before publishing the results or carrying out further therapeutic applications. In a 300-page 1922 book, The Bacteriophage: Its Role in Immunity,24 d’Hérelle wrote the original, clas- sic descriptions of bacteriophage formation of “plaques” (clear round holes in lawns of susceptible bacteria), isolation of phages from various sources, the lysis process, host specificity of adsorption and multipli- cation, the dependence of phage production on the precise state of the host, and the factors controlling stability of the free phage. He quickly became fascinated with the apparent role of phages in the natural con- trol of microbial infections and discussed the frequent specificities of the phages isolated from recuperating patients for the disease organ- isms infecting them, as well as the rather rapid variations over time of their phage populations. Throughout his life, he worked to develop the therapeutic potential of properly selected phages against the most devastating health problems of the day, traveling to many parts of the world, then teaching at Yale from 1928 to 1933 while establishing his own Laboratoire du Bactériophage in Paris, where they produced the first commercial phage cocktails such as Bacté-Intesti-Phage and Bacté-Pyo-Phage, which form the basis for today’s complex cocktails in Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, most of the English-language literature reviews of phage therapy ignored the successful application of phage therapy in France using these phage preparations, which were very carefully produced and tested by d’Hérelle’s laboratory or by the Bacteriophage Service of the Lyon and Paris branches of the Institut Pasteur. Effectively complementing other antimicrobials, some of this French use continued until the early 1990s, when the AIDS scare led the French Parliament to ban the inclusion of any sort of viruses in any kind of medications. Key to d’Hérelle’s many successes was that he focused intensely on first understanding phage biology and on applying that knowledge in his production and application of phages, including careful ongo- ing quality control and close work with physicians. The depth of his insights became more accessible via publication of a translation of this book’s appendix.24 Through much of the early developmental time, he worked closely with George Eliava, director of the Georgian Institute of Microbiology. Over the years, the two developed plans for an Institute of Bacteriophage Research in Tbilisi as a world center of phage therapy.

Noteworthy features: both nucleolytic action on host chromosome and new phage enzymes furnish DNA precursors; replicating DNA is much longer than virion DNA; a number of phage-coded proteins become associated with the host membrane to alter host functions and to facilitate phage assembly and maturation.

In 1926 the current large campus on the river Mtkvari was allotted for the project, and d’Hérelle sent supplies, equipment, and library materials. In 1934 to 1935 he visited Tbilisi for 6 months, set up his laboratory, and wrote a book, The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Recovery.25 He intended to move to Georgia, but Eliava was arrested in 1937 as a “people’s enemy” by Beria, and was executed, sharing the tragic fate of many Georgian and Russian progressive intellectuals of the time, and d’Hérelle, disillusioned, never returned to Georgia. However, their Bacteriophage Institute survived under the leadership of a group of Institute women well trained by Eliava and d’Hérelle. The Institute was transferred to the All-Union Ministry of Health in 1951, and hundreds of thousands of pathogenic bacterial samples were sent to the Institute from throughout the Soviet Union to isolate more effective phage strains and better characterize their usefulness. A new five-story building on the Eliava grounds provided facilities for making up to 2 tons of phage products twice a week, with 80% of the prepa- rations going to the Soviet military. Products included tablets against dysentery, a serious problem among soldiers, pyophage cocktails tar- geting wound and other purulent infections, and Intestiphage, still used today for a wide range of enteric pathogens. Research laboratories continually isolated new phages, upgraded therapeutic cocktails, and collaborated closely with physicians to test the phage preparations and ways of administering them. In 1988 an official Scientific Industrial Union “Bacteriophage” was formed, centered in Tbilisi with branches in Ufa, Perm, and Gorki (now called Nizhny Novgorod). After the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, the three Russian sites were pulled into the developing pharmaceutical giant, Microgen (eng.microgen .ru), which produces an even wider range of phage preparations. What is now the Eliava Institute lost most of its markets and fund- ing and struggled for survival as the factory portions were privatized. Lead research scientists switched to preparing their two most import- ant phage cocktails for Georgian use in 30-L batches in their own lab- oratories, packaged them by hand in 5-mL ampules, and sold them in the Eliava diagnostic clinic, where laboratory leaders continued to do the actual patient testing and diagnosis, supporting the laborato- ries while continuing to acquire new pathogenic strains for research and production purposes. By 1996 help became available from the International Science and Technology Centers and the NATO Civilian Research and Development Fund, the PhageBiotics Foundation, and other sources, and the institute is again thriving at its original site.

## Initial Western Explorations

Phage therapy was explored extensively in Europe and the United States in the 1920s through 1940s, with early successes being reported for a variety of diseases, including dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, staphylococcal, pyogenic and urinary tract infections, and chol- era.8 Phages have been given orally, through colon infusion, as injec- tions and aerosols, or infused directly into lesions. The early strong interest in phage therapy is reflected in some 800 papers published on the topic between 1917 and 1956. The reported results were quite vari- able. Unfortunately, many of the physicians, entrepreneurs, and phar- maceutical firms who initially became very excited by the potential clinical implications, especially in the preantibiotic era, jumped into application efforts with very little understanding of phages, microbi- ology in general, or the basic scientific process. Thus many of the early studies were anecdotal and/or poorly controlled; many of the failures were predictable; and some of the reported successes did not make sense in light of current knowledge. Too often, uncharacterized phages at unknown concentrations were given to patients without previous specific bacteriologic diagnosis, and there is no mention of follow-up, controls, or placebos. Much of the understanding being gained by d’Hérelle was ignored in this early work, and inappropriate methods of preparation, “preservatives,” and storage procedures were often used. On one occasion, d’Hérelle reported testing 20 preparations from various companies and finding that not one of them contained active phages! In general, little of the essential quality control was carried out except in a few research centers, mainly in France, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

## Specific Problems of Early Phage Therapy Work

Some still believe (erroneously) that phage therapy was proven not to work during that period; however, it simply was never adequately researched for a variety of reasons, and the work that was done well is not widely enough known. It is thus important to carefully consider the reasons for the early problems and for the questioning of efficacy: • Total lack of understanding of the heterogeneity and ecology of the phages and the bacteria involved • Lack of availability or reliability of bacterial laboratories for care- fully identifying the pathogens involved (important considering the relative specificity of phage therapy) • Use of too few of the needed different phages in infections that involved mixtures of different bacterial species and strains • Failure to select obligatorily lytic phages against the target bacteria before using them in patients • Emergence of phage-resistant bacterial strains, through selection of resistant mutants, or through lysogenization (in cases where tem- perate phages were used, as discussed in “Properties of Bacterio- phages”) • Failure to appropriately characterize or titer phage preparations, many of which, even from major companies, were shown to be totally inactive26,27 • Failure to neutralize gastric pH before oral phage administration • Inactivation of phages by both specific and nonspecific factors in bodily fluids All of these factors need to be taken into consideration as we now work to formally document phage efficacy and integrate phages into medical practice worldwide.

# PHAGE INTERACTIONS IN THE BODY

A number of early experiments involving phage injection into animals led to widespread belief that phage therapy could not succeed because the phages were too rapidly cleared by the immune system. Early experiments in rabbits, rats, and mice indeed showed rapid disappear- ance of phage from the blood and organs but long-term survival in the spleen.28,29 However, these experiments were done in the absence of host bacteria in which the phage could multiply and were often carried out by the unnatural mode of intravenous injection, expos- ing the phage almost immediately to the reticuloendothelial system. Many later studies made it clear that phages are seen in the mamma- lian circulatory system for prolonged periods when they are entering it from some sort of reservoir in other tissues and the host is dealing with infection by a bacterium in which they can replicate—precisely the sort of situation usually seen in phage therapy as currently practiced. This pattern is demonstrated particularly well in research published in 1943 by noted Harvard bacteriologist René Dubos30 (Fig. 101.5). Dubos et al.30 injected mice intracerebrally with a dose of a smooth Shigella dysenteriae strain that was sufficient to kill more than 95% of the mice in 2 to 5 days and then treated them with intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of phages that had been isolated from New York City sewage, grown in the same bacteria, and purified only by sterile filtration. With no treatment, or when treated with filtrates of bacte- rial cultures or with heat-killed phage, only three of 84 mice (3.6%) survived; in contrast, 46 of 64 (72%) of the mice given 107 to 109 of

the appropriate phages survived. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that when phages were given to uninfected mice, they appeared in the blood- stream almost immediately, but the levels started to drop within hours and very few were seen in the brain, as shown in Fig. 101.5. However, in the infected animals, brain levels of the viable phage appropriate to those bacteria soon far exceeded blood levels; around 107 to 109 phages/g were often seen between 8 and 114 hours after administration, with the level dropping between 75 and 138 hours after phage addition. After the first 18 hours, blood levels were far lower than brain levels, but phages were still present in blood at 104 to 105 phages/mL in those animals in which the brain levels were still high. Equally well-controlled experiments performed by Henry Morton and Enrique Perez-Otero from 1943 to 1945 at the University of Pennsylvania supported those of Dubos et al.30 and further showed the lack of any protection when phages with inappropriate host specificities were used. These results clearly established that (1) the phages themselves were responsible, not something in the lysate that just stimulated normal immune mechanisms; (2) phages could rapidly find and multiply in foci of infection anywhere in the body, including crossing the blood–brain barrier; and (3) phages could be maintained in the circulation as long as there was a privileged reser- voir of infection where phages were continually being produced. A final review authorized by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry discussed the major advantages of phages, such as their ability to rep- licate into problem areas and treat localized infections that are rela- tively inaccessible via the circulatory system, and the fact that their high specificity greatly aided in reducing later resistance problems.31 The review also emphasized that most of the earlier phage research had been so poorly conceived and/or carried out that it offered no proof either for or against the promise of phages as antibiotics; therefore the negative conclusions of the earlier American Medical Association reviews were neither unexpected nor very relevant to the potential for eventual success. The context of these studies sheds enlightening insights into the his- torical course of phage therapy in the United States.32 In 1942 both The Lancet and the British Medical Journal published editorials about the apparently successful use of anti-dysentery phages by the Soviet mil- itary in the Middle and Far East. By November 1942 the US National Research Council Committee on Medical Research began supporting research possibilities offered by anti-dysenteric phages for dealing with this perpetual scourge of armies (including the previous studies) in top US bacteriology laboratories new to phage work, initially requiring them to keep the results secret. This promising work ended in 1944, when the end of World War II made penicillin generally available. The military secrecy, the end of the war emergency funding, the rapid rise in antibiotic availability and their broad-spectra “wonder-drug” sta- tus, and Max Delbruck’s success in persuading the phage community to strongly shift its focus to basic molecular research involving a few model systems all contributed to the fact that there was little US fol- low-up to these very interesting and successful results. Although the results were published in major journals, few people even knew about them, or about any of the highly successful ongoing human appli- cations, until they were recently rediscovered in medical journals by Thomas Häusler during an intensive search at major libraries around the world, such as those at the National Institutes of Health and the Pasteur Institute.6 Penicillin works only against gram-positive bacteria, so it cannot treat typhoid fever, and early phage efforts against typhoid had very mixed success. It was then found that the major pathogenic strains of Salmonella typhi all carried one particular antigen, named Vi (for “vir- ulence”). In 1936 a pair of Canadians identified a number of phages specific against the Vi antigen; these are still used as “typing phages” in rapidly identifying and following outbreaks. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, physicians at the Los Angeles County Hospital used phage treatments to help deal with repeated serious outbreaks of typhoid that were killing one in five of those afflicted.33 Walter Ward tested the 1010 109 1020

When the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 109 phage, they quickly appeared in the bloodstream and some even crossed the blood–brain barrier, but they were rapidly cleared. However, when the mice were also injected intracerebrally with Shigella dysenteriae, the host for these phages, 46 of 64 of the mice survived (compared with 3 of 84 in the absence of appropriate viable phage), and the brain level of phage climbed to over 109/g. Once the bacteria cleared, the level of phage dropped below detection limits.

Vi-specific phages against mouse typhus and found that the death rate fell to 6% versus 93% in controls.33 When these phages were then used to treat patients with typhoid, only three of 56 treated patients died compared with the 20% mortality for the other treatments available at the time.34 Most impressively, this study reported that the patients who received phage therapy rapidly changed from being largely comatose to full of vigor, with renewed appetite, in 24 to 48 hours. In 1948 and 1949 near Montreal, Desranleau treated nearly 100 patients with dys- entery by giving them a cocktail of six different Vi-specific phages, and the death rate dropped from 20% to 2%.35 By then, however, chlor- amphenicol had been shown to work well against typhoid, and it was much easier for pharmaceutical companies to deal with, so that seems to have been the end of phage clinical trials in the western hemisphere. The high specificity of phages still plays a strong role in the phage typing sets used for detecting and following problem strains of such bacteria as Shigella, Salmonella, and E. coli, but phage therapy itself is only beginning to stage a comeback.

# CLINICAL APPLICATION

The growing understanding of phage biology had the potential to facilitate more rational thinking about the therapeutic process and the selection of therapeutic phages. However, there was generally little interaction between those who were so effectively using phages as tools to understand molecular biology and those working on phage ecology and therapeutic applications. Many in the latter group were spurred on by a concern about the rising incidence of nosocomial infections and of bacterial resistance against most or all known antibiotics, as well as by the fact that phages are far more effective than antibiotics in areas of the body where circulation is poor and does not disrupt nor- mal flora, such as in treating foot infections in diabetics. This strong sense of the potential importance of phages was particularly seen in Poland, France, Switzerland, and the former Soviet Union, where use of therapeutic phages never died out and where there has been ongo- ing research and clinical experience, if not the double-blind experi- ments that are now the gold standard. In France, Dr. Jean-François Vieu led the therapeutic phage efforts until 1997. He worked in the Service des Entérobactéries of the Pasteur Institute in Paris and, for example, prepared Pseudomonas phages on a case-by-case basis for patients. His experience there is discussed in two articles.36,37 In Vevey, Switzerland, the small pharmaceutical firm Saphal made “Coliphagine,” “Intestiphagine,” “Pyophagine,” and “Staphagine” in drinkable and injectable forms, salves, and sprays into the 1960s.32 The owner, Harrmann Glauser, had been encouraged and trained by d’Hérelle’s old colleague Paul Hauduroy, who had become a professor of microbiology at the University of Lausanne during World War II. These phage preparations were officially approved and were paid for by insurance. Phage therapy was used extensively in many parts of eastern Europe as a regular part of clinical practice, and companies in Russia now make phages for this purpose. However, most of the research and much of the phage preparation came under the direction of key centers in Tbilisi, Georgia, and Wroclaw, Poland. In both cases, the close inter- actions between research scientists and physicians played an important role in the high degree of success obtained, just as was the case for d’Hérelle’s early work.

## Experimental Medicine, Polish Academy of Sciences

The most detailed publications documenting phage therapy are from the Polish group originally led by Director Stefan Slopek at the Wroclaw Institute of Immunology and Experimental Medicine. Slopek’s initial series of papers described work completed in 1981 to 1986 with patients in 10 regional Polish medical centers, under the careful super- vision of the physicians there and with access to new phages from the Institute as needed.38-40 The patients ranged in age from 1 week to 86 years, and venues included the Wroclaw Medical Academy Institute of Surgery’s Cardiosurgery Clinic, Children’s Surgery Clinic and Orthopedic Clinic, the Institute of Internal Diseases Nephrology Clinic, and the Clinic of Pulmonary Diseases. In 518 cases, phage use followed unsuccessful treatment with all then-available methods, including antibiotics. The major categories of infections included long-persisting suppurative fistulas and abscesses, septicemia, respira- tory tract suppurative infections, pneumonia, and purulent peritoni- tis. In a final summary article, the results were carefully analyzed with regard to such factors as nature and severity of the infection and mono infection versus infection with multiple bacteria.40 Rates of success under these ideal conditions ranged from 75% to 100% (92% over- all), as measured by marked improvement in relevant physical condi- tion, wound healing, and disappearance of titratable bacteria; 84% of subjects demonstrated full elimination of the suppurative process and healing of local wounds. Infants and children did particularly well. Not surprisingly, the poorest results occurred in elderly patients and those in the final stages of extended serious illnesses. In the first study alone, 259 of their phages were tested (116 target- ing Staphylococcus, 42 for Klebsiella, 11 for Proteus, 39 for Escherichia, 30 for Shigella, 20 for Pseudomonas, and one for Salmonella); 40% were selected to be used for therapy. All treatments were conducted in research mode, with the phage prepared at the Institute and tested for sterility. Treatment generally involved 10 mL of sterile phage lysate given orally half an hour before each meal, with gastric juices neutral- ized by ingesting (basic) Vichy water, baking soda, or gelatin. Phage- soaked compresses were generally applied three times a day where dictated by localized infection. Treatment ran for 1.5 to 14 weeks (mean, 5.3 weeks). For intestinal problems, short treatment usually sufficed, whereas months-long use was necessary for such problems as pneumonia with pleural fistula and pyogenic arthritis. Bacterial levels and phage sensitivity were continually monitored, and the phage(s) were changed if the bacteria lost their sensitivity. Therapy was gener- ally continued for 2 weeks beyond the last positive test result for the bacteria. Few side effects were observed; those that were seen seemed to be directly associated with the therapeutic process.38 Various methods of administration were successfully used, includ- ing oral, aerosols, and infusion, either rectally or into surgical wounds. Intravenous administration was not recommended for fear of possible toxic shock from bacterial debris in the lysates.38 However, it was clear that the phages readily entered the body from the digestive tract or wounds and multiplied internally wherever appropriate bacteria were present, as measured by their presence in blood and urine and by ther- apeutic effects.41 This interesting and rather unexpected finding has been replicated in many studies and systems.42-45 The final evaluating therapist filled out a special inquiry form that was also sent to the Polish Academy of Science research team. The Computer Center at Wroclaw Technical University carried out extensive analyses of the data, using the categories established in the World Health Organization’s (1977) International Classification of Diseases. They also looked at the effects of age, severity of initial condition, type(s) of bacteria involved, length of treatment, and other concomitant treatments. After Slopek’s retire- ment, his prime assistant Dr. Beatta Weber-Dabrowska carried on with his phage therapy work with patients in regional hospitals, publishing a summary in English of the results for the next 1600 patients.46 In immunologist A. Górski took over as Institute director and revived a strong focus on phage work, with special emphasis on the immuno- logical consequences of phage treatment. These researchers have been

## Clinical Research at the Bacteriophage Institute, Tbilisi

Particularly extensive efforts for phage therapy were carried out over many decades by scientists at the Bacteriophage Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia, working closely with local physicians. Phage therapy is an accepted component of the general standard of care in Georgia, and was used extensively in pediatric, burn, and surgical hospital settings. Phage preparation was carried out on an enormous scale before the breakup of the Soviet Union, employing 700 people in the factory and several hundred more in the research arm of the Institute, often mak- ing 2 tons of phage products weekly to ship throughout the former Soviet Union. They were available both over the counter and through physicians; 80% went to the military for wound and burn infections and, largely as tablets, for preventing debilitating gastrointestinal epi- demics. In hospitals, they were used to treat both primary and nosoco- mial infections, alone or in conjunction with other antimicrobials. The International Science and Technology Centers program, set up jointly by the United States, Europe, and Japan to give constructive oppor- tunities to scientists formerly working with Soviet military projects, became one of the strongest supporters of basic and applied research in this area in Tbilisi. From the Bacteriophage Institute’s inception, the industrial part was run on a self-supporting basis, whereas its scientific branch was government supported. The Institute carried out the extensive stud- ies needed for approval by the Ministry of Health in Moscow of each new strain, therapeutic cocktail, and means of delivery. This careful study of the host range, lytic spectrum, cross-resistance, and other fundamental properties of the phages being used was a major factor in the reported successes of their phage therapy work, as were their methods for selecting highly virulent phages from among the many available against any given host. Where necessary, new cocktails were prepared with broader host ranges. The depth and extent of the work involved are impressive. For example, in 1983 to 1985, the Institute’s Laboratory of Morphology and Biology of Bacteriophages carried out studies of growth, biochemical features, and phage sensitivity on strains of Staphylococcus, 1128 of Streptococcus, 328 of Proteus, 373 of P. aeruginosa, and 622 of Clostridium received from clinics and hos- pitals in towns across the former Soviet Union. New broader acting phage strains were isolated and were included in a reformulation of their extensively used Pyophage preparation. A good deal of work went into developing the documentation for Ministry of Health approval of specialized new delivery systems, such as a spray for use in respiratory tract infections, in treating the incision area before surgery, and in san- itation of hospital problem areas. An enteric-coated pill was also devel- oped, using phage strains that could survive the drying process, and accounted for the bulk of the shipments to other parts of the former Soviet Union. Much work focused on combating nosocomial infec- tions, in which multidrug-resistant organisms have become a particu- larly lethal problem.

## Staphylococcus aureus Infections, Whether or

<!-- chunk -->

## Not Methicillin-Resistant

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a particular concern given its reduced susceptibility to antibiotic treatment, wide prevalence in hospital-acquired infections and in the community, and poten- tially lethal and otherwise serious consequences. These pathogens are targeted by the anti-S. aureus activity of phage preparations such as Pyophage (which include potent anti-Staphylococcus phages of the broad-spectrum Sb1-staph phage K family). Here as elsewhere, there is no cross-resistance between phages and antibiotics. Furthermore, very little development of resistance to this family of phages has been observed, presumably implying that the still unidentified pri- mary receptor is a molecule of significant importance to the bacteria. Thus as far as phages are concerned, MRSA is simply another strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of MRSA using phages can be accomplished by local application for local infections or, if necessary, with substantially more caution, more systemic dosing such as intra- peritoneally for systemic infections.47 The use of phage treatment for local infections, including particularly those resulting from S. aureus, has the distinction of being one of only two phage therapy strate- gies that were deemed to be convincingly efficacious by the Eaton and Bayne-Jones report in 1934,48-50 and an otherwise phage therapy skeptical publication.51 The first human phage therapy publication reported on treat- ment of S. aureus skin infections.10,52,53 The first publication on successful phage treatment in the United States in about 40 years also involved phage targeting S. aureus, in this case in diabetic toe ulcers.54 The Eliava commercial staph phage Sb1 was used to treat a series of 11 patients where antibiotics had failed and whose only other option was amputation, and all of them healed in a matter of weeks; details for six of the cases are reported here, and fur- ther information on both this work and diabetic foot phage work in Novosibirsk is provided in Fish et al.55 and Morozova et al.56 A follow-up 2 years later for one of Fish’s patients with osteoporo- sis showed that there was also significant bone regeneration.54 In France, the Pherecydes corporation now has a clinical trial under- way, approval for which by their board was based on this successful work, they have told us57 (Fig. 101.6).

## 785CHAPTER 101 Phage Therapy: Bacteriophages as Natural, Self-Limiting Antibiotics

Leszczynski et al.58 described the use of oral phage therapy for tar- geting MRSA in a nurse who was a carrier. This individual had MRSA colonized in her GI tract and also had a urinary tract infection. The result was complete elimination of culturable MRSA. The same group argued that MRSA treatment using phages could be economically pref- erable to MRSA treatment using antibiotics.59 Jikia et al.60 described phage treatment of MRSA infecting radiation burns. Slopek et al.40 reported 92.4% positive cases for phage treatment of 550 single and mixed-etiology infections involving S. aureus. Slopek et al.39 specifi- cally used phage treatment for suppurative staphylococcal infections, with a reported 93% “effective” rate “based on case history and data contained in a special questionnaire,” while also using this treat- ment of various kinds of Staphylococcus infections in children (95.5% positive results for the 90 children treated). Working in New York, MacNeal and Frisbee47 described their relatively successful treatment of staphylococcal bacteremia in 100 patients. MacNeal et al. subse- quently reported very positive results in the cumulative treatment of 500 patients with staphylococcal bacteremia, using cocktails of phages that were lytic in vitro.61

## Urogenital Tract Infections

Phages have been applied to treat various infections of the urogeni- tal systems either systemically, via direct injection into the bladder, or via topical application. Phage treatment of urogenital tract infections could potentially be complimented by current naturopathic proto- cols involving alkalinization of the urine with citrates and minerals. Eaton and Bayne-Jones48-50 in their otherwise-critical 1934 report were convinced of the efficacious use of phage therapy against cysti- tis. Letwiewicz et al.62 described phage application rectally to target Enterococcus faecalis infection of the prostate, with substantial success in eliminating the target bacteria. In this case, the phages were pre- sumed to be taken up through the rectal wall. Letarov et al.63 noted that rectal phage suppositories are available on the Russian market. Slopek et al.40 reported 92.9% positive results for phage treatment of 42 “diseases of the genitourinary tract.” Chanishvili and Sharp’s64 book has chapters on “Phage Therapy in Urology” and “Phage Therapy in Gynecology.” They summarize the results there as follows: “In cases of acute cystitis a therapeutic effect was observed within 4 to 5 hours of the first administration and resulted in relief of pain, a decrease in the frequency of urination and a normalization of the composition of the urine. Full recovery was achieved within 1 to 3 days in all 13 cases (100%), but treatment of chronic forms of cystitis was less success- ful, with only a moderate improvement observed.”64 Supported by a 3-year grant from the International Science and Technology Centers, the Eliava Institute developed a new phage cocktail specifically targeted against a large pool of bacteria from prostatitis and urinary tract infec- tions. At the 2009 Evergreen International Phage Biology Meeting, Alavidze reported on its production and on very successful prelimi- nary trials involving more than 100 patients. A collaborative Western- style double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving addition of this phage to the standard treatment at one of the major urology hospitals in Tbilisi is currently underway, supported by Swiss funding of a col- laborative research project.65

## Gastrointestinal Infections

From the beginning, acute diarrheal infections were a major and very successful part of phage therapy practice, and in both Russia and the Republic of Georgia. However, most GI problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and Crohn’s disease, typi- cally involve factors other than bacteria, and may include long-term chronic infections and immune system challenges. Although there is no body of older literature to build on from work in Tbilisi or Poland on the latter application, this would appear to be an area well worth exploration. Intestinal phage communities change in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other gut-related diseases.66 There are some reports of disease specific alterations that could potentially contribute to high trend inflammation.67 Other reports indicate specific targeting of pathogenic bacteria in IBD patients may be beneficial. The use of phage as treatment for IBD is an area that requires further study. Some research indicates the potential for tar- geting invasive E. coli strains implicated in Crohn’s disease,68 while some authors have observed an abnormal enteric virome in patients with IBD.69 As we begin to better understand the depth of the human microbiome through metagenomic analysis, we also recognize the importance of the virome, and its role in maintaining normal func- tion.70 Extensive clinical experience using phage cocktails such as Intestiphage to treat functional gastrointestinal disorders has shown a positive effect in a large portion of patients being treated in the Republic of Georgia (unpublished data), with the idea of targeting the overgrowth of pathobionts that produce by-products and that are a potential trigger for visceral pain.71 As work towards making fecal transplant a standard of care, the idea that phage preparations may contain those essential elements for restoration of normal func- tion is an important one to consider.72 A recent American controlled clinical study used phage as a prebiotic with the intent to modify gut microbiota. Its general conclusions were that phage was both safe and tolerable for consumption.73 Much additional highly relevant gastrointestinal-related work has just been published.74-78

## Respiratory Tract Infections

Respiratory infections can be differentiated into numerous types; however, phage therapy is limited in efficacy to those with a bac- terial etiology. Weber-Dabrowska et al.79 reported successful treat- ment of pneumonia in 6 cancer patients. Similarly, Slopek et al.80 reported 86.7% positive results for phage treatment in 180 “diseases of the respiratory system” (see also Slopek et al.38). The first case studies of phages used to treat people for chronic lung infections of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in Tbilisi used Pyophage and their fully sequenced S. aureus phage, phage Sb-1, which is now sold commer- cially, delivered by standard cystic fibrosis (CF) nebulizers.81,82 The latter study included a detailed description of the successful treat- ment of P. aeruginosa infection in the lungs of a 7-year-old patient (using Pyophage) along with treatment of an S. aureus coinfection in the same patient using phage Sb-1. Success in treating infections in animal models of CF associated infection was also reported by Debarbieux et al.83 and Carmody et al.,84 in addition to the explo- ration of using nebulization as a phage delivery strategy. Work with CF patients has continued at the Eliava Phage Therapy Center, with more than 20 CF patients being treated over a 5-year period. Clinical improvement and a reduction in hospitalization has been seen consistently in most patients.85 Although complete eradica- tion of pathogens from the CF lung is not expected as a result of the well-established and complex microbiota of the CF lung, they have observed several cases of eradication of particularly problem- atic bacterial infections such as the Achromobacter infection in a 17-year-old girl using a specially prepared phage preparation. In addition to general clinical improvement, lung function also sig- nificantly improved. Treatment of these infections via nebulizer is generally tolerable, although some patients do observe increased sputum production and cough or dyspnea, and all patients should be closely monitored during treatment. Phage treatments of lung infections can also be used effectively from systemic circulation, in at least some circumstances, as animal models have also shown.84

## Ear Infections

Chronic otitis externa, known less formally as swimmer’s ear, is often caused by a P. aeruginosa ear infection that resists antibiotic treatment. Otitis media is often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and is the leading cause of physician visits from children. The British company Biocontrol (now part of AmpliPhi Biosciences) developed anti-P. aeruginosa phages targeting otitis externa, after publishing similar studies on dogs.86,87 In 2009 they published the results of their dou- ble-blinded Phase 1/2a (safety and small-number efficacy) trial in human patients with this condition.88 Increases in phage numbers in situ, microbiological improvements (reductions in bacterial presence), and reduction in disease symptoms in the phage-treated cohort, but not the phage-negative controls, were observed. No side effects were seen. Complete bacterial eradication was not observed, but the extent of success was particularly notable considering that only a single phage dose was administered. Weber-Dabrowska et al.79 also reported phage therapy success in treated purulent otitis media, and Slopek et al.80 reported 93.8% positive results for phage treatment of 16 cases of con- junctivitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, and otitis media.


From a clinical standpoint, all indications are that phages are very safe. This feature is not surprising, given that humans are exposed to a very wide variety of phages from birth. Bergh et al.89 reported that nonpol- luted water contains about 108 phages/mL. Phages are normally found in the GI tract, skin, urine, and mouth, where they are harbored in saliva and dental plaque.90-92 They have also been shown to be unin- tentional contaminants of sera and therefore of commercially avail- able vaccines,93-96 which were given dispensation to be sold despite this discovery, because of the general consensus that phages are safe for humans. Extensive preclinical animal testing was required for approving new phage formulations in the former Soviet Union, but only a few of these studies were published. For example, Bogovazova et al.97,98 evaluated the safety and efficacy of Klebsiella phages produced by the Russian company Immunopreparat. Pharmacokinetic and toxicologic studies using intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or intravenous administration of phages were carried out in mice and guinea pigs. The researchers found no signs of acute toxicity or histologic changes, even using a dose 3500-fold higher than the projected human dose. They then evaluated the safety and efficacy of the phages in treating 109 patients. The phage preparation was reported to be nontoxic to humans and to be effec- tive in treating Klebsiella infections, as manifested by marked clinical improvements and bacterial clearance in the phage-treated patients. Occasional mild side effects such as liver pain and fever reported in the early days of Western phage therapy may have been caused least in part by bacterial byproducts in preparations used intravenously.99-101 Concerned about this possibility, the Polish phage therapy group does not administer their phages intravenously. The same is true for almost all of the therapeutic work carried out in Tbilisi and may help explain the apparent lack of any significant problems in both places; their many years of experience, careful attention to detail, and sup- portive infrastructure are presumably also important factors. Because phages readily enter the bloodstream after infusion in or near wounds and other sites of localized infection and travel to sites of infection throughout the body,102 there seems to be no reason for undergoing the extra risks of intravenous administration in most cases.

## Drug Interactions

No negative effects on the efficacy or safety of other drugs have been reported anywhere as a result of phage administration. No systematic studies have been carried out in this regard, but phages are so specific in their actions that it is hard to determine where such interactions might occur. In contrast, at least some antibiotics can interfere with phage treatment of localized infections by killing off the most acces- sible of the bacteria in which the phages could multiply as they work their way deeper into the site of infection; this would be a particular problem in cases in which the phages still attach and infect but cannot complete their replication cycle. Georgian physicians generally believe that antibiotics should never be used topically for wounds and deep- seated infections, because the decrease in antibiotic concentration below the surface provides a strong selection for antibiotic resistance; this problem does not occur with phages.

# DOSING STRATEGY

Phage cocktails can be designed in two distinctly different ways. The major style currently used in Georgia, Russia, and Poland, termed “active treatment,” uses a low concentration of phages and relies on in situ phage replication to achieve a therapeutically relevant concen- tration at all sites of infection by that pathogen encountered by prog- eny phage in the body. Titers of the many individual phages in each commercial cocktail are typically about 105 to 106 PFU/mL and in general 5 to 10 mL is used per dose. This approach is preferred when antibiotics fail because of poor circulation or surgical inaccessibility. “Passive treatment” ignores the self-replicating nature of phages when the infected area is directly accessible and enough phage particles are applied to treat the infection in a single dose.103


Phages have many potential advantages: • They are self-replicating but also self-limiting, because they multi- ply only in the presence of susceptible bacteria. • They can be targeted much more specifically than most antibiotics to the problem bacteria, causing far less of the bacterial imbalance or “dysbiosis” that are major problems with antibiotics, which often lead to serious secondary infections involving relatively resis- tant bacteria that can increase hospitalization time, expense, and mortality. Particular resultant problems involve Pseudomonads, which are especially difficult to treat, and Clostridium difficile, the cause of serious diarrhea and membranous colitis104; though no therapeutic phage cocktails directly targeting the anaerobe C. difficile are currently available, Intestiphage can help, presumably through rebalancing of the gastrointestinal flora. • Phages can often be targeted to receptors on the bacterial surface that are involved in pathogenesis, so any resistant mutants are less problematic. • No serious side effects have been reported for phage therapy. • Phage therapy is particularly useful for people with allergies to anti- biotics. • Appropriately selected phages can easily be used prophylactically to help prevent bacterial disease at times of exposure or to sanitize hospitals and help protect against hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections. • At least for external applications, useful phages can potentially be prepared for administration fairly inexpensively and locally, facili- tating their applications to underserved populations. • Phages can be used either independently or in conjunction with other antimicrobials to help reduce the development of bacterial resistance. The time has come to look more carefully at the potential of phage therapy for future practice, both by strongly supporting new research

## 787CHAPTER 101 Phage Therapy: Bacteriophages as Natural, Self-Limiting Antibiotics

and by scrutinizing the research already available, such as the very interesting human anti-typhoid phage research carried out in the United States in the 1940s,34 as well as the extensive earlier work in France, the United States, Georgia, Poland, and Russia.8,9 With the enormous possibilities and decreasing costs of genomic analysis, it is now possible to sequence the phages included in cocktails to ascertain more about the phage families involved and be sure that phages from temperate families are excluded, which is generally neces- sary or at least highly desirable because they may carry or acquire genes related to pathogenicity or toxin production. Sequencing is now stan- dard procedure for therapeutic phages being developed in the West. Such modern techniques are also beginning to be applied to some of the Georgian phage preparations with help from grants from the International Science and Technology Centers and Civilian Research and Development Foundation programs, both of which were set up to support civilian applications of science formerly funded by the Soviet military, and we are also doing some cocktail sequencing and detailed analysis here at Evergreen. This is an important step in considering the importation of such phages for use in the Western world. The attitude toward phage therapies and its potential are at last beginning to change in both the United States and Europe, with more and more people now becoming aware of its existence and potential applications. The 2016 case discussed in the introduction in which a UC San Diego faculty member was cured with US Navy phage of a life-threatening Acinetobacter infection obtained while visiting Egypt has been key in creating far more US attention to the efficacy of phage as a medicine. It has had wide publicity, and the many articles, mass-media releases and recent book about the experience have led to an explosion of interest in phage therapy and in expediting its compassionate use. That successful treatment was made possible by the ability of the practitioners to send patient samples to several groups working with Acinetobacter and their ability to very rapidly identify and obtain mul- tiple phages against the very unusual infective strain. Due to the recent strong interest in Acinetobacter as a result of its frequent appearance in wounds from the conflicts in Iraq and the ways the Navy and oth- ers were isolating and handling relevant phages, it was possible to very quickly test them, identify several effective phages, grow them up and purify them sufficiently with the help of phage labs in Texas and San Diego, and use them sequentially to eradicate this infection. Building libraries with several iterations of phages targeting particularly threat- ening pathogens, as some have begun to do across the world, is facili- tating a very rapid potential response and collaborative preparation of cocktails for treatment of such cases. The professor and his wife have developed a new phage therapy cen- ter at UC San Diego, taking advantage of their experience and the sub- sequent treatment there of six candidates for organ transplants, which were being seriously delayed by infectious complications. This is the first actual phage therapy center in the Americas, and is already collaborating with Ampliphi and the new Adaptive Phage Therapeutics company, set up in D.C. to work with the Navy and others to very rapidly identify and prepare appropriate phages for emergency compassionate use cases. In the U.S. any newly developed medicine attempting to make its way to market must go through the FDA, which is now accepting the concept and potential importance of phage therapy and working to adapt to its very unique aspects. The three phases of FDA clinical trials are designed to prove safety, efficacy, and marketability in respect to other approved treatments. To date, there have been just three completed Phase II clinical phage trials. The first took place in 2009 in England and dealt with very long-term chronic Pseudomonas osteitis, including a total of 12 patients; it was deemed successful in demonstrating safety and efficacy of the phage preparation used. Nestlé funded a 2016 trial of phage for acute infant diarrhea patients, developed over 15 years of selecting and intensively studying phages targeting infant diarrheal E. coli strains from the central hospital in Bangladesh and testing them in adults and older children in Switzerland and Bangladesh, as well as in the laboratory. The French firm Pherecydes led the Phagoburn trial for topical treatment of severe Pseudomonas infections in burn victims at 14 hospitals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Both of the latter tri- als confirmed safety but were deemed unsuccessful in proving efficacy, largely due to various design complications that became apparent. Although it seems premature to broadly introduce injectable phage preparations in the West without further extensive research, their suc- cessful use in the extreme San Diego cases has helped stimulate FDA approval for very serious cases. More broadly, the carefully imple- mented use of phage in external applications and for a variety of agricul- tural purposes should help reduce the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and deal with problems with which we have serious difficulty handling today. Compassionate use of appropriate phages seems now warranted and increasingly widely accepted in cases in which bacteria resistant to all available antibiotics are causing life-threatening illness. Phages are especially useful in dealing with recalcitrant nosocomial infections, in which large numbers of particularly vulnerable people are being exposed to the same strains of bacteria in a closed hospital setting. In these cases especially, the environment as well as the patients can be effectively treated with phage preparations.

## 789CHAPTER 102 Phosphatidylserine (PS)

Other animal findings indicate PS has an overall trophic (restor- ative) effect in the brain. Feeding PS to aging rats significantly slowed the usual age-related decline of forebrain cholinergic synapses16 and of nerve cell dendritic densities in the hippocampus.17,18 Also in aging rats, PS given by mouth significantly slowed the age-associated decline of receptors for nerve growth factor, a protein factor that stimulates brain circuit maintenance and renewal.18 Consistent with its importance for mitochondrial function, PS has enhanced human brain energetics. A positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study of dementia patients found that orally admin- istered PS improved energy production and utilization by an average 14% across the brain.19

## Memory Decline

The primary clinical application of PS is to improve memory and other cognitive functioning in the middle-aged and elderly. In multiple ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, PS as a dietary sup- plement consistently improved memory, learning, word recall, and other cognitive functions.2–5,20–28 In one such trial conducted with healthy subjects at an early measurable stage of cognitive decline (age-associated memory impairment), PS partially reversed the decline in the subgroup that was worst afflicted at the outset. The researchers estimated PS may have reversed approximately 12 years of decline and stated, “the magnitude of effect may be considered significant by many patients and clinicians.”3 For patients with full-blown dementia, PS has shown mild benefits for memory and concentration, along with improvement in sociability and sometimes also in activities of daily living.2,4,5,20,21,23 In the largest controlled dementia trial, a total of 425 elderly patients (aged 65–93 years) received either PS (300 mg/day) or a placebo for 6 months.5 The PS group showed improvements in verbal learning and memory as well as in withdrawal/apathy that were highly statistically signifi- cant (P <0.01) compared with the placebo group. These patients were maintained on a variety of drugs, and no clinically meaningful adverse interactions with PS were observed. In May 2003 PS acquired landmark regulatory status as a brain nutrient. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted two “qual- ified health claims” that PS may: (1) reduce the risk of dementia in the elderly; and (2) reduce the risk of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly.29 There have been indications PS also can improve mood and anx- iety, but the trials conducted to date have been very small and poorly designed.30–32 Larger and better designed clinical trials are needed to clarify the mood benefits of PS.

## Stress

There is better evidence that PS can improve coping with stress, even in young, healthy men. British male undergraduate students were ran- domized to receive PS (300 mg/day) or a placebo for 30 days, then subjected to a challenging timed mental arithmetic test.33 The PS group reported feeling less stressed after the test, compared with the placebo group. On visual analog mood scales, the PS group also surpassed placebo for feeling clear-headed, composed, and confident. Among subgroups with higher neuroticism scores, the PS subgroup reported significantly better mood after taking the test and were less stressed. Regarding stress imposed by physical challenge, a low dose of PS (200 mg/day for 42 days) was found to significantly improve golfers’ driving accuracy compared with placebo.34 High daily doses of PS (750–800 mg/day) may also improve physical performance in cycling, running, and weight training.35 Physical challenge can raise blood cortisol, and in two small trials with healthy men subjected to cycling stress, PS may have blunted this cortisol response.6,36 High doses were needed: 600 mg/day6 or 800 mg/day36 for 10 days. However, both these trials had a crossover design that may not be optimal for PS. Because PS is a cell membrane nutrient, it may require a longer “washout” time to depart the membranes than the 10 or 14 days these trials allowed. Further, well-designed trials are needed to refine the utility of PS for countering mental or physical stress. Other clinical trials suggest PS may work better against stress when combined with phosphatidic acid (PA), a phospholipid known to have cell membrane and cell-to-cell messenger functions in humans. In a randomized, double-blind trial, three groups of healthy men received two different doses of PS+PA (called PAS, in a ratio of 1:1 PS:PA by weight), or a placebo, for 42 days.37 Then they were subjected to acute stress from the Trier Social Stress Test: make an unrehearsed job appli- cation speech THEN perform a complex mental arithmetic task. This increased their salivary and serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. The high PAS dose (400 mg PS + 400 mg PA) maintained their ACTH level (but not cortisol) significantly lower, versus either the low PAS (200 mg PS + 200 mg PA) or the placebo. However, a subgroup with higher stress response to the Trier Test did also display both cortisol and ACTH blunting on the high PAS dose.

## Evolution of PS Sourcing

PS as a dietary ingredient has evolved. PS used in early clinical tri- als came from cow brain as bovine cortex PS (BC-PS), produced by a laborious and costly process. By the 1990s the advent of prion- related “mad cow disease” made this source no longer guaranteed safe. Soy became the new source. Skeptics suggested this plant-source PS would not work because its tail fatty acid profiles differed from BC-PS. BC-PS had a small content of omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in its tails (well below 10%), whereas soy has none.38 However, soy PS preparations have since produced clinical benefits in at least double-blind trials.38 Sunflower PS was also developed to avoid the perceived allergenicity of soy PS. Advances with enzyme technology have resulted in commer- cial PS preparations with omega-3 DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) contained in the molecules’ tail pieces. In a 2008 double-blind trial, a group of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed improved visual sustained attention after 3 months on a “PL-Omega3” that provided 300 mg PS and 168 mg other phos- pholipids that altogether carried 156 mg EPA and 95 mg DHA.39 This group’s improvement surpassed the other groups that received fish oil (triglyceride) EPA+DHA or placebo. Subsequently a larger ADHD trial was conducted with a “PS-Omega3” that provided 300 mg PS carrying 80 mg EPA and 40 mg DHA per day for 15 weeks. Then all the children were continued on half that dose for another 15 weeks.40 Restlessness and impulsivity improved significantly more in the PS-Omega3 group, as did a measure termed “Parent Impact-emotional.” During the exten- sion phase, those children switched from placebo to PS improved sig- nificantly on oppositional and hyperactivity scores.

Another omega-3, PS-DHA, was tried on nondemented elderly subjects with memory complaints.41 After 15 weeks, this preparation (300 mg PS, carrying about 59 mg DHA and about 20 mg EPA per day) had improved verbal immediate recall superior to a placebo. The trial was then extended for another 15 weeks,42 during which all the subjects received one third of the previous PS-DHA dose (100 mg PS, about mg DHA, about 6 mg EPA) each day. Those subjects who were con- tinuers on the PS-DHA maintained their improvement, whereas those who switched to PS-DHA from placebo attained significant improve- ment in attention and memory. These technologically advanced omega-3 PS preparations all proved safe and well tolerated.39–42 But their positive trial outcomes are tempered by findings that soy PS seemingly can perform just as well without omega-3 fatty acids attached. Thus in a double-blind trial with elderly subjects, soy PS at either 100 or 300 mg/day taken for months significantly improved delayed word recall compared with placebo.43 Also, in a double-blind trial with ADHD children, soy PS at 200 mg/day for 2 months displayed significant improvements in their overall ADHD symptoms, attention, and auditory memory, versus a placebo group.44 The researchers commented that the children who received soy PS were noticeably better behaved at school and more tidy at home. Animal research had previously indicated that the head piece of the PS molecule is the key to its cell biology and clinical benefits.2


The standard dosage recommendation for PS is 100 mg taken with meals one to three times daily. For optimal memory results, daily doses of 300 mg are more predictably beneficial.

# TOXICOLOGY AND DRUG INTERACTIONS

After more than 3 decades’ use as a dietary supplement, PS has shown no evidence of toxic effects or adverse drug interactions at dosages up to 800 mg/day.2,5,21,39–44 The superb benefit-risk profile of this cell membrane nutrient makes it a premier option for anyone desiring to rescue, upgrade, or optimize their memory and overall brain wellness.

However, Loau recognized the human flesh in the food when it was served and would not eat it. He instructed Feva’anga to plant the food in the ground and to bring him the plant that would spring forth. On receiving the mature plant, Loau instructed that a drink be prepared from it and consumed with due ceremony.

## The Kava Ceremony

Regardless of exactly how kava originated, it has been used in ceremo- nies by the Oceanic people for thousands of years. There are three basic kava ceremonies: the full ceremonial enacted on every formal occasion; the one performed at the meeting of village elders, chiefs, and nobles and for visiting chiefs and dignitaries; and the less formal kava circle common on social occasions.1,2 The first step of any kava ceremony was the preparation of the beverage. The following description of the classic process was written in 1777 by Georg Forster, a young naturalist on James Cook’s second Pacific voyage: [Kava] is made in the most disgustful manner that can be imag- ined, from the juice contained in the roots of a species of pep- per-tree. This root is cut small, and the pieces chewed by several people, who spit the macerated mass into a bowl, where some water (milk) of coconuts is poured upon it. They then strain it through a quantity of fibres of coconuts, squeezing the chips, till all their juices mix with the coconut-milk; and the whole liquor is decanted into another bowl. They swallow this nauseous stuff as fast as pos- sible; and some old topers value themselves on being able to empty a great number of bowls. As this traditional method of preparation became frowned upon or made illegal by colonial governments and missionaries, more sanitary methods of preparation, involving grinding or grating, took its place in many parts of Oceania. The full kava ceremony, reserved for very highly honored guests, involves leading all the guests to a platform. The ceremony begins with the arrival of a group of young men dressed in ceremonial attire and carrying a bowl of the kava drink and necessary uten- sils. The bowl is placed between the kava preparers and the visi- tors. The kava is poured in a cup by a specially selected individual who then turns and faces the visitor and delivers the beverage to the chief guest. The guest is instructed to hold the cup with both hands and drink from it. If the whole cup is drained without stop- ping, everyone says “a maca” (pronounced “a matha,” meaning “it is empty”) and claps three times with cupped hands. The cupbearer then returns to the kava bowl and proceeds to serve the person next in rank or importance. Important people who visit Fiji and other islands of Oceania still participate in the kava ceremonies. For example, during a 1992 presi- dential campaign visit to Hawaii, Hillary Clinton participated in a kava ceremony conducted by the Samoan community on O’ahu.

## The Effects of Drinking Kava

Kava drinkers relate a pleasant sense of tranquility and sociability upon consumption. Subjective reports given by scientists who have sampled kava themselves are relatively abundant. One of the first scientific stud- ies of kava was performed by the noted pharmacologist Louis Lewin in 1886. A later description written in 1927 is as follows1: When the mixture is not too strong, the subject attains a state of happy unconcern, well-being and contentment, free of physical or psychological excitement. At the beginning, conversation comes in a gentle, easy flow and hearing and sight are honed, becoming able to perceive subtle shades of sound and vision. Kava soothes tem- peraments. The drinker never becomes angry, unpleasant, quar- relsome or noisy, as happens with alcohol. Both natives and whites consider kava as a means of easing moral discomfort. The drinker remains master of his consciousness and his reason. When con- sumption is excessive, however, the limbs become tired, the muscles seem no longer to respond to the orders and control of the mind, walking becomes slow and unsteady and the drinker looks partially inebriated. He feels the need to lie down. He is overcome by som- nolence and finally drifts off to sleep. A later description was provided by researcher R.J. Gregory, who wrote the following from his own experience1: Kava seizes one’s mind. This is not a literal seizure, but some- thing does change in the processes by which information enters, is retrieved, or leads to actions as a result. Thinking is certainly affected by the kava experience, but not in the same ways as are found from caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or marijuana. I would per- sonally characterize the changes I experienced as going from lineal processing of information to a greater sense of “being” and content- ment with being. Memory seemed to be enhanced, whereas restric- tion of data inputs was strongly desired, especially with regard to disturbances of light, movements, noise and so on. Peace and quiet were very important to maintain the inner sense of serenity. My senses seemed to be unusually sharpened, so that even whispers seemed to be loud while loud noises were extremely unpleasant. Drinking about half a coconut shell (100–150 mL) of certain vari- eties of kava is enough to put most people into a deep, dreamless sleep within 30 minutes. Unlike alcohol and other sedatives, kava does not produce a morning hangover. The kava drinker awakens having fully recovered normal physical and mental capacities.


Many of the first comprehensive studies on the activities of kavalactones were conducted by a team of scientists from the Freiburg University Institute of Pharmacology in Germany, led by Hans J. Meyer, during the 1950s and 1960s.3 This research determined that kavalactones exhibit sedative, analgesic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxing effects in laboratory animals. These studies seemed to confirm earlier empiri- cal and subjective observations. Later studies used better-defined kava extracts.

## Isolated Kavalactones Compared With Crude Extracts

Some evidence suggests that the whole complex of kavalactones and other compounds naturally found in kava produce greater pharmaco- logical activity. In addition, studies showed that kavalactones are more rapidly absorbed when given orally as an extract of the root rather than as the isolated kavalactones. The bioavailability of lactones, as mea- sured by peak plasma concentrations, is three to five times higher from the extract than when given as isolated substances.3 Further evidence that kava root extracts are superior to isolated kavalactones was offered by an animal study demonstrating that although isolated kavalactones were well absorbed by the brain, crude kava preparations produced brain concentrations of lactones 2 to 20 times higher.4 This evidence suggests that crude extracts standardized for kavalactone content may offer the greatest therapeutic benefit. Several clinical trials featured a kava extract standardized to con- tain 70% kavalactones. However, this high percentage of kavalactones might be sacrificing some of the other constituents that may contribute

to the pharmacology of kava. More important than the actual per- centage of kavalactones is the total dosage of the kavalactones and the assurance that the full range of kavalactones and other important con- stituents are present.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sedative Effects

Numerous studies confirmed and/or elaborated on the sedative effects of kava. Most notable were studies that demonstrating that kavalactones exert many of their effects through nontraditional mechanisms. For example, most sedative drugs, including the ben- zodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, triazolam, clorazepate dipotassium), work by binding to specific receptors (benzodiazepine or γ -ami- nobutyric acid [GABA] receptors) in the brain, leading to the neu- rochemical changes (potentiation of GABA effects) that promote sedation. Studies in animals showed that the kavalactones do not bind to benzodiazepine or GABA receptors.5 Instead, the kavalac- tones are thought to somehow modify receptor domains rather than interact specifically with receptor-binding sites. In addition, other studies indicated that the kavalactones appear to act primarily on the limbic system, the ancient part of the brain that affects all other brain activities and is the principal seat of the emotions.6 It is thought that kava may also promote sleep by altering the way in which the limbic system modulates emotional processes. It appears that many of the laboratory models of identifying how a substance works to promote a calming effect are simply not sophisticated enough to evaluate the physiological effects of kava.

## Analgesic Effects

In another example of the unusual pharmacological qualities of kava, a study designed to evaluate its pain-relieving effects could not demon- strate any binding to opiate receptors.7 The significance of this find- ing was that the study used experimental models in which nonopiate analgesics like aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were ineffective. In addition, it was determined that the sedative or muscle-relaxing effects were not responsible for the pain-relieving effects. These findings indicate that kava reduces pain in a manner unlike morphine, aspirin, or any other pain reliever.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiolytic Effects

An interesting difference of kava from other anxiolytics is that kava does not lose effectiveness with time. Kavalactones, even when administered in large doses, demonstrated no loss of effectiveness in animal studies.8 This is another example of the unusual qualities of kava. Despite the long history of kava consumption and the wealth of clinical evidence in favor of the efficacy of kavalactones in treating anxiety, there is a severe gap in our understanding of the molecu- lar target(s) and the mechanism(s) of action of these psychoactive compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-Ischemia Effects

Another important pharmacological activity of kava is its ability to protect against brain damage resulting from ischemia.9 This effect was demonstrated in two animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. The effectiveness of the kavalactones was a result of their ability to limit the infarct area and to provide a mild anticonvulsant effect. Kava extract may prove useful in the recovery from a stroke.

## Anti-Inflammatory Effects

In animal studies, the compounds extracted from Piper methysticum show promise in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory condi- tions. Kava-241, an optimized kavain derived compound, significantly reduced epithelial downgrowth and alveolar bone loss in a model of periodontitis.10 Kava-241 treatment also significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor- α in serum from mice, emphasizing the novel proper- ties of Kava-241 in the management of tumor necrosis factor- α –related diseases such as infective rheumatoid arthritis.11


The primary clinical application of kava is in the treatment of anxiety. This application is well supported by clinical research.12 However, the medicinal use of kava is shrouded in uncertainty as a result of reports of hepatoxicity (discussed in the “Toxicology” section).

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiety

Early clinical trials used d,l-kavain, a purified kavalactone, at a dosage of 400 mg/day. For example, in one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 84 patients with anxiety symptoms, kavain was shown to improve vigilance, memory, and reaction time.13 In another double- blind study, kavain was compared with oxazepam (a drug similar to diazepam [Valium]) in 38 patients.14 Both substances caused progressive improvements in two different anxiety scores (Anxiety Status Inventory and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale) over a 4-week period. However, whereas oxazepam and similar drugs are addic- tive and cause side effects, kavain appeared to be free of these complications. In one of the early studies with kava extracts, a 70% kavalactone extract was shown to exhibit significant therapeutic benefit in patients with anxiety.15 The study was double-blind, and 29 patients were assigned to receive 100 mg of the kava extract three times a day whereas 29 other patients received a placebo. Therapeutic effectiveness was assessed using several standard psychological assessments, including the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). The results of this 4-week study indicated that individuals taking the kava extract had a statistically significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, including feelings of nervousness, and somatic complaints, such as heart palpitations, chest pains, headache, dizziness, and feelings of gastric irritation. No side effects were reported with the kava extract. Studies also compared the effects of a kava extract standardized to contain 30% kavalactones with buspirone and opipramol. In the dou- ble-blind study, 129 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were given either 400 mg kava (30% kavalactones), 10 mg buspirone, or 100 mg opipramol daily for 8 weeks.16 Detailed analysis showed that no significant differences were observed regarding all efficacy and safety measures. About 75% of patients were classified as responders (50% reduction of the HAMA score) in each treatment group, and about 60% achieved full remission. Kava was also shown to be particularly effective in relieving anxi- ety in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.17–19 In one dou- ble-blind study, two groups of 20 women with menopause-related symptoms were treated for 8 weeks with the 70% kavalactone extract (100 mg three times daily) or placebo.20 The measured variable was once again the HAMA. The group receiving the kava extract demon- strated significant improvement at the end of the very first week of treatment. Scores continued to improve over the course of the 8-week study. In addition to symptoms of stress and anxiety, a number of other symptoms also improved. Most notably there was an overall improvement in subjective well-being, mood, and general symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes. As with previous studies, no side effects were noted. Additional studies showed that unlike benzodiazepines, alcohol, and other drugs, kava extract was not associated with depressed men- tal function or impairment in driving or the operation of heavy equip- ment.21,22 In one of these studies, 12 healthy volunteers were tested

in a double-blind crossover manner to assess the effects of oxazepam (placebo on days 1–3, 15 mg on the day before testing, 75 mg on the morning of the experiment), the extract of kava standardized at 70% kavalactones (200 mg three times daily for 5 days), and a placebo on behavior and event-related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalo- graphic readings on a recognition memory task. The subjects’ task was to identify within a list of visually presented words those that were shown for the first time and those that were being repeated. Consistent with other benzodiazepines, oxazepam inhibited the recognition of both new and old words as noted by ERP. In contrast, kava allowed a slightly greater recognition rate and a larger ERP difference between old and new words. The results of this study once again demonstrated the unusual effects of kava. In this case it improved anxiety, but unlike standard anxiolytics, kava actually improved mental function and, at the recommended levels, did not promote sedation. Another study indicated that kava helped improve reflex vagal control of heart rate in GAD patients.23 In 2009 the first documented human clinical trial assessing the anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacy of an aqueous extract of kava was published.24 The World Health Organization suggested the investigation of aqueous kava extracts as a way to reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity with kava preparations. The Kava Anxiety Depression Spectrum Study was a 3-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial that recruited 60 adult participants with 1 month or more of elevated generalized anxiety. The kava preparation pro- duced significant anxiolytic and antidepressant activity and raised no hepatoxicity or safety concerns at the dose and duration stud- ied. Specifically, kava reduced participants’ HAMA scores in the first controlled phase by −9.9 versus −0.8 for placebo and in the second controlled phase by −10.3 versus +3.3. Pooled analyses also revealed highly significant relative reductions in anxiety and depression scale scores. In a subsequent 6-week, parallel, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving 75 participants with GAD (58 randomized to 120 mg daily kavalactones titrated to 240 mg for nonresponse), results revealed a significant reduction in HAMA scores in favor of kava over placebo.25 For participants with moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, the treatment effect was more pronounced. As part of this trial, five GABA transporter polymorphisms were examined as poten- tial pharmacogenetic markers of kava response. Within the kava group, GABA transporter polymorphisms rs2601126 and rs2697153 were associated with significant reductions in HAMA scores, suggest- ing specific GABA transporter polymorphisms may potentially mod- ify anxiolytic response to kava.


In clinical studies using pure kavalactones or kava extracts standard- ized for kavalactones, the dosage was based on the level of kavalactones. Because the kavalactone content of the root varies between 3% and 20%, preparations standardized for kavalactone content are preferred to crude preparations. A standard bowl of traditionally prepared kava drink contains approximately 250 mg of kavalactones, and in Oceania, several bowls may be consumed at one sitting. Dosages vary according to the desired therapeutic effect. • Anxiolytic dosage: 45 to 80 mg of kavalactones three times a day • Sedative dosage: 180 to 250 mg of kavalactones 1 hour before retiring

# SIDE EFFECTS AND TOXICOLOGY

In November 2001 German health authorities announced that 24 cases of liver disease (including hepatitis, liver failure, and cirrhosis) associated with the use of kava had been reported. Of the affected persons, one died and three required a liver transplant. As a result, in December 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration began advising consum- ers of the potential risk of severe liver injury associated with the use of kava-containing dietary supplements. Kava was subsequently with- drawn from the market in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada. In 2007 Germany reevaluated the data, and the ban imposed on kava was overturned in 2014 after the decisions of two adminis- trative German courts.26 In the initial report, the true nature of kava- induced liver damage was clouded by the fact that in 18 of the cases, conventional prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs with known or potential liver toxicity were also being used. Proponents of kava quickly argued that it was entirely possible that the use of kava by these individuals was a coincidence rather than the cause of the liver problems, resulting from excessive dosage or some other factor. As of 2007, of the approximately 100 cases of hepatotoxicity that were reported worldwide, causality deemed to be “probable” occurred in only 14 cases.27 Two drug-monitoring studies, including a total of patients taking 120 to 150 mg kava extract per day, did not find a sin- gle case of kava-induced hepatotoxicity. A thorough review concluded that kava-induced hepatotoxicity would be extremely rare, highlight- ing the fact that even if all the cases of reported toxicity were causally linked to kava intake, as drug-induced hepatotoxicity frequency ranges from 1 to 10 per 100,000 exposed individuals, kava would be under per 100,000.28 The existing data are complex, but it appears that the major factor in any kava-induced hepatotoxicity was the use of aerial parts, such as stems and leaves as well as stem peelings.29 Once the demand for kava skyrocketed, there was not enough kava root to fill the demand. Suppliers then knowingly or unknowingly purchased the leaves and peelings of kava. The only parts of the kava plant that were tradition- ally used throughout its 3000-year history were the roots, never the peelings or the leaves. According to a World Health Organization report, German pharmaceutical industries preferred to buy kava stem peelings to extract kavalactones to make kava drugs; kava stem peelings were sold at almost one tenth of the price of kava roots.30 In addition, dosage might also have been a factor in some of the cases of hepato- toxicity. A survey of 400 German medical practices showed that 78% of the kava prescriptions that were written before 2001 significantly exceeded the recommended intake.31 Nonetheless, there were reports of hepatitis in patients using kava at dosages equal to or only slightly higher than recommended levels, indicating other factors beyond dos- age.32 Flavokawain B, a chalcone from kava root, was identified as a potent hepatocellular toxin.33 Measures suggested to address the hepatotoxicity issue include: (1) use of a noble kava cultivar such as Borogu, which is at least years old at time of harvest; (2) use of peeled and dried rhizomes and roots; (3) dosage recommendation of less than or equal to 250 mg kavalactones per day (for medicinal use); and (4) a Pan Pacific qual- ity control system enforced by strict policing.29 Another important step may be determination of flavokawain B. It should be mentioned that although it has been suggested that traditional aqueous extracts should be used over ethanolic or acetonic extracts, the toxicity is linked to the kava plant itself, with a possibly low quality of the used kava cultivar or kava plant part rather than the method of extraction or solvent.34 High daily dosages of kava consumed over a prolonged period (a few months to a year) are associated with a number of side effects beyond liver damage, including the development of “kava dermopathy,” a condition of the skin characterized by a peculiar generalized scaly eruption known as kani.35 The skin becomes dry and covered with scales, especially the palms of the hands, soles of

the feet, forearms, the back, and shins. It was thought at one time that kava dermopathy might be caused by interference with niacin. However, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, niacinamide (100 mg/day) demonstrated no therapeutic effect.36 It appears that the only effective treatment for kava dermopathy is reduction or cessation of kava consumption. No cases of kava dermopathy have been reported in persons taking standardized kava extracts at rec- ommended levels. Other reported adverse effects of extremely high doses of kava (e.g., more than 310 g/week) for prolonged periods are37: • Biochemical abnormalities (low levels of serum albumin, protein, urea, and bilirubin) • Elevated liver enzymes • Presence of blood in the urine • Increased red blood cell volume • Decreased platelet and lymphocyte counts • Shortness of breath At this time, kava is not recommended for use by anyone who has any liver problems or who is a regular consumer of alcohol. Use of kava for more than 4 weeks requires close monitoring of liver enzymes (once every 4–6 weeks). Patients should be instructed to discontinue use of kava if symptoms of jaundice (e.g., dark urine, yellowing of the eyes) occur. Nonspecific symptoms of liver disease include nausea, vomiting, light-colored stools, unusual tiredness, weakness, stomach or abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Kava is not recommended for use by pregnant or breastfeeding women.


Kava may potentiate the effects of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and prescription sedatives. Kava also inhibits a number of the cytochrome P450 enzymes that play a role in the breakdown of many medica- tions.38 Therefore it has the potential to interact with a wide range of medications. There is evidence that kava interferes with dopamine or other drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease; therefore until this issue is resolved, kava extract should not be used by patients with Parkinson’s disease.35

root. However, it is from the chicory root (Cichorium intybus) that most of the commercially produced inulin and oligofructose is man- ufactured. Short-chain fructans, such as oligofructose, are produced from inulin through a process of partial enzymatic hydrolysis.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Commercial Forms

There are two ways in which FOS can be consumed, in supplements and in foods.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fructooligosaccharide Supplements

The most commonly employed method to purify and concentrate FOS for supplement use is via a hot water extraction of fresh chic- ory roots. This process results in inulin (a large-chain FOS) as the end-product. Some manufacturers use enzymatic hydrolysis to pro- duce oligofructose (a medium-chain FOS) from inulin,9 although other manufacturers synthesize FOS from sucrose using the fungal enzyme fructosyltransferase (from Aspergillus niger). This latter pro- cess involves chemical synthesis of a new compound (called Neosugar or Actilight, a short-chain FOS) from two other natural compounds (fructose and glucose). The finished compound is similar to naturally obtained FOS, only smaller in size.8 FOS are resistant to digestion in the upper GIT because of the β -configuration of the bonds between the fructose units. Human digestive enzymes are specific in requiring α -linkages; thus, FOS are classified as nondigestible oligosaccharides.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Sources of Fructooligosaccharides

As previously mentioned, FOS are common food ingredients. Individuals consuming the standard Western diet consume an average of 5.1 g/day of FOS.11 However, this can easily be increased if foods rich in FOS are consumed daily. Foods containing FOS are outlined in Table 104.2. There is no advantage to the consumption of FOS in supplements compared with FOS-rich foods. If the amount of FOS consumed in a food is similar to that used in clinical studies, it will promote similar effects, as all FOS consumed reach the colon intact, whether ingested in whole foods or in supplements.

## Clinical Applications

The health benefits claimed for FOS mainly stem from their ability to increase numbers of beneficial organisms in the colon, to reduce numbers of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, and to stimu- late short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. These health benefits include: • Enhanced resistance to enteric pathogens due to colonization resis- tance provided by the increased growth of lactic acid bacteria12 • Increased resistance to infections due to the nonspecific stimula- tion of the immune system12 • Modification of carcinogen metabolism12 • Enhanced absorption of minerals12 • Improved serum lipid parameters12 • Improved satiety13 • Improved metabolic health114 • Treatment of atopic eczema and prevention of atopy develop- ment14 • Increased intestinal mucin production and trophic effects on the colonic epithelium, secondary to the increased production of SCFAs15 This review focuses primarily on the ability of FOS to improve the microbiota composition, enhance the immune response, improve mineral absorption, treat and prevent atopic diseases, improve satiety, and improve metabolic health.

## Microbiota Composition

A number of trials have now verified the capacity of FOS to benefi- cially modify the microbiota-increasing levels of beneficial bacterial species while simultaneously decreasing levels of pathobionts. Table 104.3 contains an overview of some of these trials showing the effects observed at different dosage points.

In an attempt to determine the optimal dose of FOS, in terms of maximizing bifidobacteria numbers and minimizing side effects, Bouhnik et al.16 designed a trial that used five different dosage levels. The dosages used were 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 g/day of oligofructose and g/day as the placebo. The trial lasted 7 days. The data indicated that bifidobacteria counts did not change in subjects who received 0 or 2.5 g/day of oligofructose, but that concentrations in those subjects who ingested 5, 10, and 20 g/day were significantly greater (P < 0.05) at day 8 than at baseline. A significant correlation between the ingested dose of oligofructose and fecal bifidobacterial counts was observed at day 8 (P < 0.01). In terms of side effects, all groups, including the placebo group, experienced mild abdominal symptoms, such as bloat- ing, excess flatus, borborygmi, or mild abdominal pain. In general, the higher the dose of oligofructose, the more side effects experienced.

Bouhnik et al.16 concluded that 10 g/day was well tolerated and that this dose was probably the optimal dose of oligofructose because it led to a significant increase in colonic bifidobacteria with minimal side effects in most participants.

## Immune Response

Prebiotics, like FOS, have long been suggested to have immune enhancing effects.18,19 It is, however, only recently that human clini- cal trials with hard outcomes have been completed. One of the first of these trials investigated the effects of a prebiotic mixture (containing a combination of FOS and GOS) in protecting against infections during the first 6 months of life in formula-fed infants. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, infants allocated to the prebi- otic group experienced significantly fewer episodes of all types of infec- tions combined (P = 0.01) compared with those in the placebo group. There was also a trend for fewer episodes of upper respiratory tract infection (P = 0.07) and fewer infections requiring antibiotic treatment (P = 0.10) in the prebiotic group. Additionally, the cumulative inci- dence of recurring infection and recurring respiratory tract infection was 3.9% and 2.9% in the prebiotic group versus 13.5% and 9.6% in the placebo group, respectively (P < 0.05).20 This same infant cohort was followed up over the next 1.5 years. Those infants that received the prebiotic-enhanced formula for the first 6 months of life experienced significantly fewer episodes of

physician-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (P < 0.01), fever epi- sodes (P < 0.00001), and fewer antibiotic prescriptions (P < 0.05) com- pared with those in the placebo group.21 In a randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label study, Bruzzese et al.22 also investigated the efficacy of a prebiotic-enhanced infant formula (a combination of GOS and FOS) on infection incidence in infants. The prebiotic-enhanced formula or a standard infant for- mula was consumed over the initial 12 months of life. During this period, the incidence of gastroenteritis was 59% lower in the prebi- otic group (P = 0.015). Additionally, the number of children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections tended to be lower in the prebiotic group (28% vs. 45%; P = 0.06), and the number of children prescribed multiple antibiotic courses per year was also lower (40% vs. 66%; P = 0.004).22 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial looking at older children (aged 7–19 months) attending daycare centers, short- term administration (21 days) of FOS was found to significantly reduce the number of infectious diseases requiring antibiotic treatment (P < 0.001), episodes of diarrhea and vomiting (P < 0.001), and episodes of fever (P < 0.05) compared with controls.23 In another randomized, controlled trial investigating the effects of FOS in toddlers (4–24 month olds) attending daycare, FOS administration was found to significantly reduce antibiotic use (32% reduction; P = 0.001) and daycare absenteeism (61% decrease; P = 0.025) compared with those in the control group. There was also a 34% reduction in episodes of fever in combination with any cold symptoms (P = 0.001) and a 61% decrease in episodes of fever in association with diarrhea (P < 0.05) in the FOS-supplemented group.24

## Mineral Absorption

Studies using animal models have demonstrated that microbiota degradation of FOS significantly increases calcium and magnesium absorption.25-27 Human studies have also shown that FOS consump- tion improves calcium absorption.28-30 The proposed mechanism by which mineral absorption is enhanced by FOS is via the action of the protonated SCFA. Protonated SCFAs are absorbed across the apical membrane of colonocytes by direct diffusion. Due to the low pK a val- ues of the SCFA in relation to the intracellular pH, the SCFA dissoci- ates once it enters the cell. This results in the release of a hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion is subsequently secreted from the cell in return for a cation, which may be a magnesium or calcium ion. The hydrogen ion is then available to protonate another SCFA and enable it to diffuse into the cell.28 However, other mechanisms may also be involved, such as the decrease in colonic pH, which results in increased solubility of calcium, increased colonic venous blood flow, enlarged colonic villi, and enhanced expression of calbindin-D9k (the active calcium trans- port route).31 These effects are more pronounced in the colon, some of which are calcium-specific, explaining why calcium absorption is increased, whereas there is very little effect on the absorption of other minerals (e.g., iron and zinc).32

## Bioavailability of Phytoestrogens

An interesting animal (rat) study recently found that concurrent consumption of FOS and the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein significantly improved the bioavailability of these compounds. The relative absorption of genistein was approximately 20% higher in FOS-fed rats than in controls. In addition, the presence of both phy- toestrogens in serum was maintained longer in FOS-fed rats than in controls, suggesting that FOS enhanced colonic absorption of these compounds.33 This result may be especially relevant to women after antibiotic ther- apy, when the metabolism and subsequent absorption of phytoestro- gens appears to be impaired.34 Bifidobacteria were demonstrated to possess β -glucosidase activity, and FOS administration resulted in enhanced β -glucosidase activity in animal models35 and improved phytoestrogen bioavailability.36 Therefore FOS consumption not only aids in the reestablishment of a healthy gut microbiota, but its con- sumption also increases colonic β -glucosidase activity, resulting in enhanced deglycosylation and, thus, increased colonic concentrations of the medicinally active aglycones.

## Atopic Eczema and Prevention of Atopy Development

A number of studies found an aberrant composition of the GIT microflora in infants who later developed food allergies and atopic eczema.37-39 More specifically, the development of atopic eczema was correlated with increased colonic concentrations of Bacteroides spp., Clostridia spp., and Escherichia coli, with a decreased concentration of bifidobacteria. This change in microbial composition was theorized to deprive the developing immune system from counterregulatory signals against T-helper 2 (Th2) mediated responses, and therefore promote Th2-type immunity.39 Infantile atopic eczema is character- ized by a Th2-dominated immune response, as well as excessive intes- tinal inflammation and aberrant macromolecular absorption across the intestinal mucosa.40-42 These latter characteristics may also be caused by the dysbiotic condition. Bacteroides, clostridia, and E. coli all have the potential to trigger inflammatory responses in the gut and can release toxins that can impair intestinal permeability, leading to increased exposure to potential antigens.39 Supplementation with FOS was demonstrated to decrease colonic concentrations of both bacte- roides and clostridia, as well as promoting a bifidobacteria-dominated colonic flora.17 FOS use may thus bring the aberrant intestinal flora back into balance and improve gut barrier function. The promotion of an intestinal flora dominated by gram-positive bacteria may also promote a shift toward Th1 immunity via enhanced production of interleukin-12 and interferon- γ .43 No trials appear to have assessed FOS in isolation in the treatment or prevention of atopic eczema. One trial was conducted, however, which assessed the efficacy of a FOS and GOS combination in the pre- vention of atopic dermatitis in infants. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Moro et al.44 evaluated the effects of a prebiotic-enhanced infant formula

on the incidence of atopic dermatitis during the first 6 months of life in formula-fed infants at high risk of atopy development. Atopic dermatitis developed in 23% of infants in the control group com- pared with 10% in the prebiotic group (P = 0.014) over the 6-month intervention period.44 Subjects in the prebiotic group were also found to have significantly reduced plasma levels of total immuno- globulin (IgE) (P = 0.007), IgG2 (P = 0.029), and IgG3 (P = 0.0343), as well as cow’s milk protein-specific IgG1 (P = 0.015), suggesting that FOS and GOS supplementation induced an antiallergic anti- body profile.45 These same infants were followed up over the next 18 months. Those infants that received the prebiotic-enhanced formula for the first 6 months of life were at reduced risk of developing atopic disease over the follow-up period. Infants in the control group experienced a significantly higher rate of atopic disease, such as atopic dermatitis (27.9% vs. 13.6%), recurrent wheezing (20.6% vs. 7.6%), and aller- gic urticaria (10.3% vs. 1.5%), compared with infants in the prebiotic group (all P < 0.05).21 The capacity of prebiotics (as a class of agents) to prevent allergic diseases was assessed in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis. Prebiotic supplementation to formula-fed infants significantly reduced the risk of developing eczema (RR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40–1.15), wheez- ing/asthma (RR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17–0.80), and food allergy (RR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08–1.00). Nineteen of the 22 studies included in the review evaluated the effects of a FOS-GOS combination (like that pre- viously mentioned) typically added to formula.115

## Satiety

In the wake of some interesting preliminary animal research,46 a sin- gle-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess the effects of FOS on satiety and energy intake in humans. Subjects ingested either 8 g of FOS twice daily (with breakfast and dinner) or a placebo. FOS supplementation was found to significantly increase sati- ety at breakfast and dinner (both P = 0.04), but not lunch. At dinner, FOS supplementation was also found to reduce hunger (P = 0.04) and prospective food consumption (P = 0.05). Energy intake at breakfast (P = 0.01) and lunch (P = 0.03) were also found to be significantly reduced after FOS supplementation, resulting in a 5% decrease in total energy intake per day.13 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investi- gated the effects of FOS supplementation in overweight and obese subjects. Over a 12-week period, subjects consumed either a placebo or 21 g/day of FOS. Subjects in the FOS group experienced a mean reduction of 1.03 kg body weight compared with a 0.45 kg increase in weight in the control group (P = 0.01). FOS consumption was also associated with a lower area under the curve for ghrelin (P = 0.004) and a higher area under the curve for peptide YY (P = 0.03), sug- gesting an upregulation of satiety hormone secretion. These changes coincided with a reduction in self-reported caloric intake (P ≤ 0.05). Serum glucose concentrations and insulin levels also significantly improved in the FOS group compared with baseline measures (both P ≤ 0.05).47

## Metabolic Health and Type 2 Diabetes

Inulin and Jerusalem artichokes have a long history of use in the treat- ment of diabetes, with the first recommendations of their use in the medical literature dating back to 1925.116 More recently, there have been a number of animal and human trials that have substantiated this use. A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal models that evaluated the effect of FOS supplementation on glucose homeostasis found the consumption of FOS to consistently decrease fasting blood glycemia levels, irrespective of the animal’s metabolic status (e.g., in healthy, obese, or diabetic animals) and diet (low-fat or high-fat). A global reduction of 18% in fasting glycemia was observed in the FOS- treated animals compared with controls. There was a clear dose-de- pendent effect. FOS supplementation also increased fasting and postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 concentrations, as well as peptide YY concentrations.117 A number of recent randomized controlled trials have shown FOS supplementation to aid in the management of type 2 diabetes. In one of the first of these trials, 10 g daily FOS supplementation over a period of months to women with type 2 diabetes resulted in significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose levels of 8.5%, glycosylated hemoglobin levels of 10.4%, and malondialdehyde levels of 37.2% (all P < 0.05). Additionally, there were significant increases in total antioxidant capacity (18.8%) and superoxide dismutase activity (4.4%) in the FOS group compared with controls (both P < 0.05). However, changes in fasting insulin, homeosta- sis model assessment of insulin resistance, and catalase activity were not significant compared with the placebo group.118 In a follow-up study, the same dose of FOS given over 8 weeks to women with type 2 diabetes resulted in significant decreases in fasting blood sugar (8.5%), hemoglobin A1c (10.4%), fasting insulin (34.3%), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (39.5%), high-sen- sitivity C-reactive protein (35.6%), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α (23.1%), and plasma lipopolysaccharide (27.9%) compared with the placebo group (all P < 0.05). The authors concluded that FOS sup- plementation improved blood sugar regulation, modulated inflamma- tion, and decreased metabolic endotoxemia in diabetic women.119 In another similarly designed trial, 10 g FOS/day given to over- weight women with type 2 diabetes for 8 weeks resulted in significant decreases in levels of fasting plasma glucose of 9.5%, glycosylated hemoglobin of 8.4%, interleukin-6 of 8.2%, TNF- α of 19.8%, and plasma lipopolysaccharide of 22.0% compared with placebo controls (all P < 0.05). Decreases in levels of interferon- γ and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and increases in the level of interleukin-10 were not significant in the FOS group compared with controls.114 A further study in a similar population of overweight diabetic patients evaluating the anti-inflammatory effect of FOS found 10 g/ day over 45 days to significantly decrease TNF- α mRNA expression, in addition to decreasing high-sensitivity CRP levels and diastolic blood pressure (all P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Gastrointestinal populations of the beneficial microbe Akkermansia muciniphila significantly increased with FOS supplementation.120


Studies showed a bifidogenic effect in dosages of 4 to 40 g/day of FOS. The optimum dosage in adults, in terms of side effect profile and increases in bifidobacteria, is considered to be 10 g/day.16 However, it may be a good idea to start off with a lower dose (e.g., 3 g/day) and slowly increase it to reduce chances of adverse GIT reactions. Dosages of less than 3 g/day in adults are unlikely to cause significant alterations in the GIT microecology. Studies in infants and toddlers generally administered between 1 and 3 g/day of FOS.

## Toxicity

FOSs are components of many common foods. There are no geno- toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, or toxicological effects associated with the ingestion of any FOS.12,48 Oligofructose and inulin are officially recognized as natural food ingredients in most European countries and have a self-affirmed “Generally Regarded as Safe” status in the United States.8 Recently a published case study described an instance of anaphy- laxis attributed to inulin found in vegetables and processed foods. This

was later confirmed with skin-prick testing and blinded food-provoca- tion testing.49 This allergy does appear to be extremely rare, however, considering the widespread consumption of FOS-containing foods. The only side effects noted with administration are mild digestive symptoms, such as flatulence, borborygmi, abdominal bloating, and abdominal discomfort. However, these effects are dose-dependent and occur less regularly in smaller doses. Over time, these symptoms will diminish as the intestinal flora adjusts to the greater amount of sub- strate available.50 However, some individuals may continue to expe- rience mild abdominal bloating and discomfort even with continued use. There have been some concerns in the literature regarding the abil- ity of Klebsiella pneumoniae to use FOS as a growth substrate.51,52 FOS was shown to stimulate the growth of K. pneumoniae in Petri dishes. However, this occurred only when Klebsiella was grown in isolation, with no other competing organisms present. In mixed culture exper- iments, where Klebsiella was grown in the presence of many other human GIT microorganisms, this did not occur.9 In these situations, which more closely resemble the environment of the human GIT (where more than 500 species of bacteria compete for available growth substrates),53 FOS did not stimulate the growth of Klebsiella.8 In addi- tion, no human or animal experiment has ever reported an increase in the Klebsiella concentration in the GIT after FOS consumption. Given the efficacy of a diet low in oligosaccharides (e.g., the low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol [FODMAP] diet) in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),121 it would be prudent to be cautious with FOS supplementa- tion in patients with IBS. Not all patients react negatively to FOS sup- plementation, however.122 Additionally, some research has found FOS supplementation in IBS patients to decrease rectal hypersensitivity and reduce anxiety levels; thus providing benefit to these patients.123 Therefore in IBS patients where FOS supplementation is warranted, it may be a case of starting low and slowly increasing the dose over a few weeks to achieve the therapeutic dose.

# GALACTOOLIGOSACCHARIDES

<!-- chunk -->

## Description

Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are chains of galactose molecules, typ- ically containing between three and eight units, with a glucose mole- cule at the reducing terminus. Galactose-containing oligosaccharides are found in all mammalian milks.54 Commercially, they are pro- duced synthetically from lactose, typically using the bacterially derived enzyme β -galactosidase.55 Like all prebiotics, GOS are neither broken down nor absorbed in the upper GIT.

<!-- chunk -->

## Commercial Forms

GOS are available in two main forms: syrup and powder. As galac- tose-containing oligosaccharides are abundant in human breastmilk, GOS have recently been added to some artificial infant formulas in efforts to more closely approximate breastmilk.56,57 Foods naturally rich in GOS are outlined in Table 104.4.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinical Applications

GOSs have a number of clinical applications, including: • Promotion of bifidobacterial growth • Treatment of constipation • Prevention of atopic disease • Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome • Increased resistance to infections • Prevention of gastrointestinal infections • Improved absorption of calcium • Promoting skin health • Modulating mood and the stress response

## Bifidobacterial Growth

A number of studies have now shown the ability of GOS to benefi- cially modify the gastrointestinal microbiota—both increasing levels of beneficial bacterial species while simultaneously decreasing levels of

pathobionts. Table 104.5 contains an overview of some of these trials showing the effects observed at different dosage points. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial attempted to determine the optimal dose of GOS by investigating the effects of four different doses: 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 g/day. After 7 days of consumption of 10 g/day, fecal bifidobacteria levels increased 0.4 log units (P = 0.007 compared with placebo). In the dose–response phase of the trial, there were no significant differences found between the different GOS doses in their capacity to increase bifidobacteria numbers (i.e., there was a lack of dose response).58

<!-- chunk -->

## Treatment of Constipation

A number of studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of GOS administration on bowel function. Consuming 9 g/day of GOS was found to increase defecation frequency (from 5.9–7.1 movements per week) in elderly subjects over a 2-week treatment period. There was also a trend for easier defecation (P = 0.07) during the GOS phase of the trial.59 Randomized controlled trials evaluated the laxative effects of GOS in healthy adult subjects with a tendency to constipation. At a daily dose of 5 and 10 g, there were significant improvements in defecation frequency, from 0.92 to 1.07 movements daily (P < 0.05) and from 0.85 to 0.97 times per day (P < 0.05), respectively.60

<!-- chunk -->

## Atopic Disease

No trials appear to have assessed GOS in isolation for the treatment or prevention of atopic eczema. One trial was conducted, however, assessing the efficacy of a GOS and FOS combination in the preven- tion of atopic dermatitis in infants. This trial is discussed in the FOS section under “Treatment of Atopic Eczema and Prevention of Atopy Development.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Irritable Bowel Syndrome

In a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, sup- plementation of 3.5 g/day of GOS to subjects with IBS was found to sig- nificantly improve stool consistency, flatulence scores, bloating scores, and overall IBS symptom scores compared with placebo (all P < 0.05) over a 4-week treatment period. Supplementation of 7 g/day resulted in significant improvements in overall IBS symptom scores and a reduction in anxiety levels compared with placebo (both P < 0.05). However, there was also a significant increase in bloating scores relative to baseline when subjects were taking the higher dosage (P < 0.05).61

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune Function

No human studies appear to have assessed GOS on their own for the improvement of immune function. A number of trials were conducted assessing the efficacy of FOS and GOS combinations, however. These trials are discussed in the FOS section.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gastrointestinal Infections

Animal and in vitro models suggested that GOS supplementation might have a protective effect against a range of gastrointestinal patho- gens. GOS was demonstrated to reduce adherence of pathogenic strains of E. coli to gastrointestinal cells,62 inhibit binding of Vibrio cholerae toxin to its receptor in the human GIT,63 and reduce coloniza- tion and pathology associated with Salmonella typhimurium infection in a murine model.64 These preliminary results inspired a recent randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the potential of GOS administration to prevent travelers’ diarrhea. Subjects ingested 2.6 g GOS once daily, starting 7 days before reaching their holiday destina- tion and continued taking it daily throughout their holiday. Compared with the placebo group, subjects in the GOS group experienced a 40% decrease in the incidence (P < 0.05) and a 48% reduction in duration of travelers’ diarrhea (P < 0.05). Additionally, they had less abdominal pain (P < 0.05) and experienced improved quality of life (P < 0.05).65

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcium Absorption

Research found supplemental GOS significantly increased calcium absorption in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in post- menopausal women. Administration of 20 g/day was found to increase true calcium absorption from 16% during placebo administration to 24% during GOS treatment (P = 0.04). This increase in absorption was not accompanied by increases in urinary calcium excretion.66

<!-- chunk -->

## Skin Health

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, investigators examined the effects of GOS ingestion (2 g/day) on the condition of the skin. After 12 weeks of supplementation, the increase in corneo- meter values from baseline to week 12 was significantly greater in the GOS group than in the placebo group (6.9 vs. 2.9 arbitrary units, P < 0.05). A corneometer uses the high dielectric constant of water to analyze the water-related changes in the electrical capacitance of the skin. An increase in corneometer values is interpreted as improved skin hydration. The transepidermal water loss in the GOS group was also significantly reduced after 12 weeks of GOS treatment (20.1 g/h/ m2 at baseline vs. 17.5 g/h/m2 at week 12; P < 0.05). Additionally, GOS treatment significantly reduced total wrinkle area and the percentage of wrinkle area compared with baseline (P < 0.05), whereas both these values increased slightly in the placebo group.124 A further randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial eval- uated the effects of a prebiotic combination (GOS + lactulose; 4.5 g/ day total) on skin health. At the end of the 8-week trial, subjects in the prebiotic group showed a reduction in mean wrinkle length and depth as measured via a quantitative skin evaluation, whereas the pla- cebo group showed slight increases in these parameters (P < 0.001). The wrinkle severity rating scale significantly improved in the prebiotic group, versus a worsening in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The global esthetic improvement scale was also significantly higher for the prebiotic group (P < 0.001). The mechanisms by which orally ingested prebiotics improve skin condition and hydration are not currently known.125

## Mood and Stress Response

As detailed in the previously mentioned IBS GOS trial, the 7 g/day dose was found to significantly reduce anxiety scores in IBS patients.126 This

finding has stimulated other researchers to examine the potential of prebiotics, and GOS treatment in particular, to modify mood. Using a mouse model of chronic stress, investigators found GOS or a GOS-FOS combination to attenuate acute stress-induced corti- costerone release and reduce the number of stress-induced bowel movements. The combination also significantly increased hippo- campal brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene expression, GABA receptor gene expression, and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cor- tex. Additionally, the GOS-FOS combination reduced stress-induced depression-like and anxiety-like behavior in the mice.127 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either FOS (5.5 g/day), GOS (5.5 g/day), or pla- cebo for 3 weeks. At the end of the 3 weeks, salivary morning cortisol was significantly lower only in the GOS group (P < 0.05). This group also experienced increased processing of positive versus negative atten- tional vigilance. The results suggest the capacity of GOS to beneficially modify neuroendocrine stress responses in humans.128


A bifidogenic effect was observed in doses of 2.5 to 15 g/day. With no apparent dose response, there appears to be little benefit in dosing higher than the minimum required dose (i.e., 2.5 g/day) for this pur- pose. For the treatment of IBS, 3.5 g/day seems to be the optimal dose. For anxiety management and to modify the stress response, 5.5 to 7.0 g/day appears efficacious, whereas for the prevention of travelers’ diarrhea 2.6 g/day has been shown to be effective. To enhance calcium absorption, higher doses may be required (e.g., 20 g/day). The Golden Rule of prebiotic dosing is to start low and slowly increase the dose over a period of weeks to achieve the therapeutic or optimal dose. Most individuals tolerate a starting dose of 2.5 g/day with few issues—only minor digestive discomfort (if any). However, if a patient is very prone to bloating and distension, one can start at one-quarter to one-half this dose. It is worth noting, however, that GOS supplements have been found to decrease bloating, distension, and abdominal pain scores in patients with irritable bowel syndrome,126 and some research has found GOS to actually decrease intestinal gas (hydrogen) production.129

## Toxicity

Galactose-containing oligosaccharides are found in all mammalian milks. Animal research has consistently demonstrated a lack of geno- toxic, mutagenic, or toxicologic effects with GOS ingestion.67 The non- toxic dose level of GOS was found to be over 2000 mg/kg body weight per day in murine models.68 Therapeutic use of GOS is considered very safe and GOS themselves are components of many commonly consumed foods. Clinical trials have generally found GOS to be very well tolerated (in infants, adolescents, adults, the elderly, and during pregnancy),126,130-133 with GIT side effects (e.g., bloating) only noted with higher doses in most research.126 Supplemental GOS is generally very well tolerated, even in individuals who react to other prebiotics (e.g., FOS and lactulose) and even in those patients who react to food sources of GOS (i.e., legumes).

# LACTULOSE

<!-- chunk -->

## Introduction

Lactulose is a semisynthetic disaccharide composed of the monosac- charides fructose and galactose. It was first synthesized from lactose in 1929 by Montgomery and Hudson.69 The human digestive system lacks the ability to break down lactulose into its component hexose and pentose moieties. Hence, lactulose is neither catabolized nor absorbed in the small intestine. Once lactulose reaches the large intestine, it is fermented by the normal intestinal microflora. Fermentation is the process through which the normal intestinal microflora catabolizes carbohydrates to obtain energy for growth and maintenance of cellular functions. The end products of lactulose fermentation include SCFA, lactic acid, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.70 In vitro experiments demonstrated that overall SCFA production is increased two- to threefold by the addition of lactulose, whereas acetate synthesis is increased four- to sixfold.71 Within the large intestine, these SCFAs are avidly absorbed by colo- nocytes and used as a source of energy, either locally or systemically. The production of SCFA also results in the acidification of the colonic contents.70 Bown et al.72 demonstrated that a daily dose of 30 to 40 g of lactulose decreased the pH of the proximal colon from 6.0 to 4.85.

<!-- chunk -->

## Commercial Forms

Lactulose is available in two forms: syrup and crystalline powder. Lactulose syrup generally contains between 5% and 67% lactulose (in addition to some lactose and galactose), whereas the crystalline powder is composed of 99% lactulose. The only food source of lactulose thus far identified is ultraheat treated milk; however, lactulose is present only in insignificant amounts.4

## Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterial Growth

In one of the original studies using lactulose to change the GI micro- biota, MacGillivray et al.73 assessed the effects of lactulose feeding on infants. All infants were formula-fed and under 4 months old. After a short feeding period of 2 days, the lactulose-containing formula feed produced a preponderance of Lactobacillus bifidus (now known as Bifidobacterium bifidum) in the stools of 88% of infants. In 66% of the infants, B. bifidum dominated the microbiota in concentrations of greater than 90%. None of these infants had a bifidobacteria-domi- nated flora at baseline.73 Terada et al.74 reported that 3 g/day of lactulose taken over a 2-week period altered intestinal microbiota and fecal bacterial metabolism in adults. The study was conducted in eight healthy volunteers. During the intake of lactulose, the number of bifidobacteria increased significantly (P < 0.001), as did the lactobacilli population (P < 0.05), whereas the number of Bacteroidaceae and clostridia decreased (P < 0.05) compared with baseline. Bifidobacteria became the numerically dominant micro- organism in the fecal flora after 14-day administration. The fecal metab- olites skatole, indole, and phenols were also significantly decreased with lactulose intake (P < 0.05). Fecal β -glucuronidase, azoreductase, and nitroreductase activities also decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after days of treatment. These latter results indicated decreased metabolism of putrefactive (protein fermenting) organisms of the microbiota. The mean fecal pH also decreased from 7.0 to 6.4.74 Ballongue et al.75 conducted a double-blind, randomized, pla- cebo-controlled study, assessing the effects of a daily dose of 20 g of lactulose (10 g bid) on the gastrointestinal microbiota. After a 4-week treatment period, populations of Bacteroides, Clostridium,

and coliforms decreased by 4.1, 2.3, and 1.8 log units, respectively. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus populations increased by 3.0 and 1.9 log units (both P < 0.01 compared with placebo), respectively. The fecal pH also decreased from a baseline of 6.9 to 5.8 by the end of the treatment period (P < 0.01). Acetic acid production was increased by 33% and lactic acid production by 30% (P < 0.01) via lactulose admin- istration. Gastrointestinal production of putrefactive by-products, cresol, indole, phenol, and skatol were all significantly reduced by lactulose administration (all P < 0.05), as were the production of the bacterial enzymes, azoreductase, α -dehydroxylase, β -glucuronidase, nitroreductase, and urease (all P < 0.05).75

## Inhibition of Potentially Pathogenic Microorganisms

Research suggests that lactulose not only enhances the growth of ben- eficial members of the GIT microbiota, but also inhibits the growth of potential intestinal pathogens. Studies demonstrated that lactu- lose consumption can decrease colonic concentrations of clostridia, Bacteroides spp., and coliforms,75 as well as eradicating carrier states of Salmonella spp.76 Some preliminary evidence also suggests a possible role for lactulose therapy in the treatment of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.77 The ability of lactulose to increase numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and to decrease numbers of gram-negative bacteria is believed to be a result of two mechanisms. The first is lactulose’s ability to act directly as a food source for lactobacilli and bifidobac- teria organisms, while being only weakly metabolized by gram-nega- tive organisms.78 The second mechanism is the change in colonic pH caused by the end products of lactulose metabolism—lactic acid and SCFAs. The coupled effect of production of SCFAs and pH decrease has been shown to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria. The decreased pH resulting from lactulose administration was shown to increase the total concentration of the undissociated forms of SCFA.75 These lipophilic acids can penetrate the microbial cell membrane, and at the higher intracellular pH, dissociate to produce hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions interfere with essential metabolic functions, such as substrate translocation and oxidative phosphorylation, and hence inhibit the growth of gram-negative microbes.79 In vitro experiments also demonstrated the ability of lactulose to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans. A continuous flow culture was used as a model of the human GIT ecosystem. Within 24 hours of the input of 0.25% lactulose, C. albicans numbers were reduced by 97%. The reduction in Candida numbers was believed to be caused by the increase in the growth of beneficial lactic acid bacteria and the overall decrease in pH.80

## Constipation

Lactulose is used in conventional medicine mainly for its laxative effects. It works primarily as an osmotic laxative, but the increased production of SCFAs may also play a role.70,81 Ingestion of lactulose was found to cause statistically significant increases in the frequency, weight, volume, and water content of stools and to produce stools of softer consistency compared with both baseline and placebo.82

## Colon Cancer Prevention

Lactulose may protect against the development of colon cancer via a number of different mechanisms. Firstly, lactulose administration was found to decrease the production of secondary bile acids in the intesti- nal tract (secondary bile acids have been postulated to be promoters of colonic carcinogenesis). This effect was thought to be mediated by the reduction in luminal pH caused by lactulose fermentation.83 Secondly, lactulose also has the ability to decrease the metabolism of PPMs. This action appears to be directly related to lactulose’s ability to decrease the colonic pH. The low pH suppresses overall metabolism of these organisms, which can be indirectly measured by the decrease in fecal enzymatic activity by these microorganisms. In a human trial, Ballongue et al.75 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the specific activity of a number of bacterial enzymes that are believed to be involved in the genesis of colon cancer. Azoreductase activity was lowered by 45%, 7- α -dehydroxylase by 40%, β -glucuronidase by 38%, nitroreductase by 36%, and urease by 27% (all P < 0.01). Facultative anaerobes like coliforms and anaerobes like Clostridium and Bacteroides normally produce β -glucuronidase, 7- α -dehydroxylase, and nitrore- ductase. The decreased activity of these enzymes correlated with the decreased numbers of bacteroides, clostridia, and coliforms found in this clinical trial after administration of lactulose.75 Thirdly, lactulose appears to inhibit the formation of ammonia within the intestinal tract.84 Ammonia was shown to alter the mor- phology and intermediary metabolism of intestinal cells, as well as increasing DNA synthesis in, and reducing the life span of mucosal cells.85 It is also considered to be more toxic to healthy mucosal cells than transformed cells and, thus, it may potentially select for neoplas- tic growth.86 Thus any inhibition of ammonia production should be of benefit in the prevention of colon tumorigenesis. Additionally, a randomized clinical trial conducted by Roncucci et al.87 demonstrated the ability of lactulose to prevent the growth of resected colorectal polyps. Lactulose administration (20 g/day) reduced the recurrence rates of colonic polyps by 66% (P < 0.02) com- pared with controls.87

## Hepatic Encephalopathy

Hepatic encephalopathy is often found as a complication of liver cir- rhosis. It is considered the totality of nervous system manifestations of liver failure. Symptoms include tremors, mental confusion, memory loss, and personality changes. The exact cause of hepatic encephalopa- thy is not known. However, it is commonly believed that an accumula- tion of neurotoxins (particularly ammonia) in the cerebral circulation is the main causative factor.88 A number of studies have found lactu- lose to be effective in the management of this condition89-91 and in its prevention.92

## Endotoxemia

Endotoxins (also known as lipopolysaccharides) are constituents of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria continuously shed components of their outer cell membranes, partic- ularly as they die. Gram-negative bacteria can comprise a significant portion of the intestinal microbiota (e.g., members of the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla can make up more than 50% of the micro- biota in some individuals)134; thus, this membrane shedding results in significant quantities of endotoxins being released into the intestinal lumen. In healthy individuals, with good intestinal integrity, luminal endotoxin causes minimal systemic effects. However, in individuals with a compromised intestinal barrier or suboptimal liver function, this intestinal endotoxin can have pathological consequences.94 In fact, a number of diseases are now being linked to excessive absorption of GI-derived endotoxins, which has a negative effect on the systemic inflammatory milieu, including: alcoholic liver disease,135 Alzheimer’s disease,136 atherosclerosis,137 congestive cardiac failure,138 chronic fatigue syndrome,139 depression,140 metabolic syndrome,141 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,142 obesity,143 and type 2 diabetes.144 Hence, there is a great need for agents capable of both decreasing endo- toxin load in the lumen, as well as having other antiendotoxin effects. Research by Liehr et al.95 has demonstrated that lactulose possesses antiendotoxin activity. When rats were fed lactulose over 4 or 8 days before intravenous administration of galactosamine, the liver damage

that normally develops was prevented. Because galactosamine-induced liver necrosis and inflammation is mediated by systemic endotox- emia of intestinal origin, the prevention of liver inflammation and necrosis after lactulose consumption suggests an antiendotoxin effect. This effect was most likely mediated by an alteration of the intesti- nal microecology, which indirectly diminished the intestinal pool of endotoxin. However, the authors also suggested a direct antiendotoxin effect, as intravenous administration of lactulose also prevented galac- tosamine-induced hepatitis.95 This work was followed by a prospective, controlled trial assessing the use of lactulose in endotoxemia secondary to obstructive jaundice. Oral lactulose (30 mL/6 h) was given to 12 patients for 3 days before sur- gery, whereas another 12 patients served as controls. Lactulose adminis- tration significantly reduced the incidence of endotoxemia in the portal blood during the operation and in the systemic blood postoperatively (both P < 0.05). Interestingly, lactulose appeared to both decrease the luminal pool of endotoxin and directly prevent endotoxin absorption.96

## Urinary Tract Infections

Two human studies demonstrated the efficacy of lactulose therapy in the prevention of UTIs. McCutcheon and Fulton97 conducted a retro- spective study using 45 elderly, long-term hospital patients as subjects. The study found that daily lactulose therapy for 6 months (30 mL lact- ulose syrup) resulted in a significant reduction in UTIs compared with controls (P < 0.025). Sixteen of the 17 lactulose-treated patients (94%) remained infection free over the 6 months compared with 16 of the control patients (57%) (P < 0.005). In addition, there was a significant reduction in the number of antibiotic prescriptions (P < 0.05) and in the number of patients who received antibiotics (P < 0.005) in the lac- tulose group.97 In the second study, Mack et al. enrolled 75 elderly, hospital- ized patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty-eight patients received the placebo and 58 received lactulose therapy. Twelve percent of the lactulose group developed UTIs during follow-up compared with 32% in the control group (P < 0.01). Thus lactulose consumption demonstrated significant protection against the develop- ment of UTIs.98 The intestinal microbiota appears to act as a reservoir for urinary tract pathogens. Microorganisms such as E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and K. pneumoniae are all frequent urinary tract patho- gens, and these organisms are also commonly found in the GIT. These organisms can escape the confines of the large bowel, and in susceptible individuals colonize the vagina, periurethral area, and distal urethra. From these areas they can ascend into the bladder. Thus interventions that can inhibit the growth of these organisms in the GIT should result in decreased numbers of these organisms colonizing the genitourinary tract.93 This is likely to be the mechanism by which lactulose therapy prevents UTIs. Ingestion of lactulose acidifies the large bowel and sig- nificantly increases the production of SCFAs.72,75 At a low pH, these SCFAs (particularly butyrate) inhibit the growth and metabolism of enterococci and E. coli, substantially reducing their overall populations in the large bowel,93 and thus decreasing the intestinal reservoir of uri- nary tract pathogens.

## Calcium and Magnesium Absorption

In a randomized, controlled trial, low-dose lactulose consumption (2 g/day) was found to significantly improve magnesium absorption, and high dose (4 g/day) administration significantly improved both cal- cium and magnesium absorption in adult males (all P < 0.01 compared with placebo). There appeared to be a clear dose-dependent effect, with the higher lactulose dose being more effective than the lower for both magnesium and calcium.99


Doses as low as 3 g/day (equivalent to about 5 mL of the syrup) have been shown to cause beneficial alterations in the intestinal micro- biota.74 However, higher doses (e.g., 10 g twice a day) appeared to produce more substantial positive changes.75 As with FOS and GOS, therapy should commence with a lower dose and slowly increase over time. For the treatment of constipation, the recommended dose is from 15 to 40 g/day.82,100 Higher dosages are usually used ( ∼ 35 g/day) for the management of liver disease.101

## Toxicity

Therapeutic use of lactulose is considered to be extremely safe, with adverse reactions generally being mild and few. Side effects consist of vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.102 However, these reactions tend to occur only in single doses of more than 60 g. This appears to be the maximum load of lactulose that the intestinal flora is able to metabolize to SCFAs at one time. When the bacterial fermentation capac- ity is exceeded, osmotic diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and nausea may result. These symptoms are most likely caused by the interference with net fluid absorption in the colon as a result of the osmotic effect of malab- sorbed and intact sugars.70 Nonetheless, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and discomfort are common symptoms when lactulose therapy is com- menced. Gastrointestinal symptoms, however, diminish as the colonic microbiota adapt to the greater amount of fermentable substrate.103

# SYNBIOTICS

Synbiotics are products that contain both probiotic and prebiotic agents.104 The combination is supposed to enhance the survival of the probiotic bacteria through the upper GIT, improve implantation of the probiotic in the colon, and have a stimulating effect on the growth and/or activities of both the exogenously provided probiotic strain(s) and the endogenous inhabitants of the bowel.105 Over the past 10 years, research in this area has been steadily growing. When considering the therapeutic potential of a product claimed to be a synbiotic, a number of factors should be assessed: 1. Does the product use well-characterized and researched probiotic strains? (See Chapter 105 on Probiotics.) 2. Does the “prebiotic” substance meet the requirements to be truly considered a prebiotic? 3. Has the “prebiotic” been demonstrated to enhance the growth of the exact probiotic strain(s) contained in the product? 4. Are both agents included in therapeutic doses? Ideally, a synbiotic product should meet all four of these criteria. Unfortunately, many currently on the market do not.

<!-- chunk -->

## Strain-Specific Synbiotic Combinations

Individual probiotic strains (see Chapter 105 on Probiotics) have variable capacities to use different prebiotic substrates. For example, Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 can use GOS, lactulose, and FOS, but is unable to use lactitol.106 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is unable to use lactulose, lactitol, or FOS.107,108 Both L. acidophilus NCFM and L. aci- dophilus DDS-1 can use FOS as a growth substrate.108 Sadly, there is currently a paucity of research in this area to guide decision-making.

# COLONIC FOODS

## Introduction

Colonic foods are defined as “foods entering the colon and serving as substrates for the endogenous colonic bacteria, thus indirectly provid- ing the host with energy, metabolic substrates and essential micronutri- ents.”2 By definition, colonic foods escape digestion and absorption in

<!-- chunk -->

## 808SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

the upper GIT to reach the colon intact. Here members of the colonic microbiota ferment them to produce SCFAs, hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. Through the production of SCFAs, the ingestion of colonic foods plays a pivotal role in the health of the host.81 Colonic foods lack the specificity of fermentation that prebiotics possess. Thus their ingestion promotes the growth and/or metabolic activity of a number of different bacterial species within the large bowel, including species that are considered potentially harmful. Colonic foods include plant cell wall polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose), hemicelluloses, pectins, and many gums.2 Commonly used fibers, such as slippery elm, pectin, psyllium husks, and guar gum should all be considered colonic foods, not pre- biotics, because they are used by a number of different bacterial spe- cies in the bowel. For example, guar gum is metabolized by Bacteroides spp. and Ruminococcus spp.109; pectin is fermented by Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., and Clostridium spp.110; and psyllium husks are fermented primarily by Bacteroides spp.109 Some foods, however, have demonstrated the ability to selectively promote the growth of beneficial species of bacteria. Foods and food constituents that have shown this selective fermentation capacity are listed in Table 104.6.

## Drug Interactions

FOSs and GOSs do not appear to interact with any pharmaceuticals. When used in prebiotic dosages, lactulose is also unlikely to elicit any drug interactions. When administered in larger doses for use as a lax- ative over prolonged periods of time, however, there is a theoretical risk of increased electrolyte loss, which could affect electrolyte balance. These electrolyte alterations could potentiate the risk of more severe electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia, which has been associ- ated with the use of some medications (e.g., corticosteroids, diuret- ics, and drugs that prolong the QT interval). However, lactulose is less likely to elicit electrolyte disturbances with long-term use than other laxatives because of the capacity of the colonic microflora to adapt to lactulose ingestion, with long-term ingestion resulting in a reduction in lactulose-induced gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea.103,111 When used in laxative dosages, lactulose was found to signifi- cantly increase the relative risk of over anticoagulation in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants, presumably via decreased intestinal absorption.112

of healthful effects from fermented foods were considered unscien- tific folklore. However, a substantial and growing body of scientific evidence has now demonstrated that lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and, more broadly, fermented foods, can play a significant role in promot- ing human health and treating disease. The bulk of probiotic research to date has focused on strains from two genera—Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. The genus Lactobacillus is characterized by considerable heterogeneity. They are gram-positive, nonsporing, and rod-shaped bacteria that produce lactic acid as the major end product of carbohydrate fermentation. Lactobacilli appear to be fairly unique, in that they have been isolated from a number of diverse environments, such as fermented vegetables and dairy foods, as well as the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and vagina.6 In contrast, bifidobacteria are not found in natural fermentative processes but are native to the GIT.7 Bifidobacteria are also gram-pos- itive, nonsporing bacteria; however, they are Y-shaped instead of rod- shaped, and their major fermentative end product is acetic acid.8 Research is currently underway on the isolation and commercial- ization of next-generation probiotics, using novel strains isolated from important gastrointestinal species, such as Akkermansia muciniph- ila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.6,9 Other research has evaluated microbiologically complex “probiotic” products derived from human fecal specimens.6,7 A number of so-called “soil-based probiotics” are now also commercially available and have a growing research base,8 so expect the marketplace to expand dramatically in the variety of probi- otic products over the coming decade.

# PROPOSED MECHANISMS OF ACTION

The exact mechanisms by which probiotics accomplish their myr- iad beneficial actions have become clearer over the past two decades and we now know of several mechanisms that explain many of their favorable effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune Modulation

A growing body of evidence indicates that some probiotic strains are capable of modulating the immune system at both the systemic and the mucosal levels, affecting many cell types (e.g., dendritic cells, epithelial cells, natural killer cells, etc.). This immune response may take the form of increased secretion of immunoglobulin A via inter- action with mesenteric lymph nodes,10,11 enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages, or elevated numbers of natural killer cells.12 Recent research has demonstrated that dendritic cells in the lamina propria can extend their appendices between epithelial cells, and, via toll-like receptors on their surface, sample probiotic-bacterial molecular pat- terns. This interaction leads to the maturation of the dendritic cells and to the release of cytokines, which orchestrate the conversion of naive T-helper cells (Th0) into a mature, balanced response of T-helper cells (Th1, Th2, and Th3/Tr1).11

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-Inflammatory Activity

Probiotic strains have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects via a number of different mechanisms. Some can secrete metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties (e.g., antitumor necrosis factor [TNF]- α effects),13 some can interact with toll-like receptors,14 others down-regulate the transcription of a number of genes encoding proin- flammatory effectors,15 and others upregulate production of anti-in- flammatory cytokines.16

<!-- chunk -->

## GIT Transit Time Modification

Some probiotic strains can modify GIT transit. Two strains of bifido- bacteria have been found to significantly speed colonic transit time,17,18 and a strain of propionibacteria has been shown to slow descending colon transit.19 The mechanisms by which probiotics alter GIT tran- sit time have not yet been fully elucidated; however, it is postulated that a bacterial metabolite may affect sigmoid tone and alter colonic motility.20

<!-- chunk -->

## Induction of Oral Tolerance

The GIT microbiota has been shown to play a crucial role in generating an adequate population of Th2 cells that are capable of oral tolerance induction.21 In the presence of intestinal dysbiosis, some probiotic strains can also help induce oral tolerance and help protect against the development of food allergies.22 Other strains have been shown to induce oral tolerance even in the presence of anaphylactic reactions.23

<!-- chunk -->

## Decrease Visceral Hypersensitivity

Animal research has suggested that some probiotic strains are capa- ble of decreasing visceral hypersensitivity, believed to be one of the main contributing factors to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders.24-26 The exact mechanisms are unknown, but another lactobacilli strain has been shown to decrease visceral hypersensitivity by inducing cannabinoid and opioid receptor expression in the colonic epithelium.27

<!-- chunk -->

## Competition for GI Adhesion Sites

Many pathogenic organisms must associate with the GIT epithelium to colonize effectively. However, some strains of bifidobacteria and lacto- bacilli can adhere to the epithelium and act as “colonization barriers” by preventing pathogens from adhering to the mucosa.28 This effect has been demonstrated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and L. plan- tarum 299v. Both of these organisms have shown the ability to inhibit attachment of Escherichia coli to human colon cells.29

## Antagonism Against Potentially Pathogenic Microor-

<!-- chunk -->

## ganisms (PPMs) and Viruses

One of the mechanisms by which probiotics exert their beneficial effects is via inducing changes to the GIT microbiota, specifically by inhibiting the growth of potentially pathogenic organisms. Some pro- biotic strains are capable of producing inhibitory substances such as bacteriocins, lactic acid, and oxygen metabolites, such as hydrogen peroxide.30,31 A number of probiotic strains have demonstrated in vitro inhibitory activity against a range of potentially pathogenic micro- organisms, such as Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile, E. coli, Candida albicans, Salmonella enteric, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio chol- erae.32-35 Some probiotic strains (L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12) can also bind to viruses, such as rotaviruses, helping pre- vent mucosa-associated viral infections.36 Several probiotic strains have also demonstrated the ability to bind or remove toxins, such as aflatoxins and cyanotoxins,36 as well as inhibit the effects of bacterial toxins, such as C. difficile toxins A and B.37 Specific strains have also been found to reduce the expression of virulence factors via inhibition of pathogen gene encoding.38

## Selective GI Antimicrobial Activity

Ingestion of selected probiotic strains has been found to significantly increase GI populations of beneficial bacteria (i.e., lactobacilli or bifidobacteria) while simultaneously decreasing populations of less health-promoting genera.39-41

<!-- chunk -->

## Production of Beneficial Compounds

The production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as metabolic byproducts is a characteristic that almost all probiotic strains share. These SCFAs help create a healthier colonic milieu by decreasing the

## 811CHAPTER 105 Probiotics

luminal pH, and some (e.g., butyrate) are used as energy sources by colonocytes.42,43 Other probiotic strains can help restore normal small intestinal architecture and upregulate intestinal brush border enzyme expression via the luminal release of polyamines.44-46 These strains will have clinical utility in situations of small intestinal damage and decreased brush border enzyme activity, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, or after small intestinal infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## Strengthen the Intestinal Barrier

A number of probiotic strains have been found to increase mucin production in the gut via increases in mucin gene expression, which provides a protective coating between the lumen and intestinal epithe- lial cells.47,48 Probiotics are also capable of directly strengthening the intestinal barrier. A strain of L. plantarum (WCSF1) has been found to decrease paracellular intestinal permeability by increasing the reloca- tion of occludin and zonulin into the tight junction between duodenal epithelial cells.49 Other strains appear to enhance barrier function via the preservation of enterocyte cytoskeleton architecture and enhance- ment of tight junctional protein structures.43 Such strains should prove useful in the treatment and prevention of intestinal permeability.

# PROBIOTIC CHARACTERISTICS

Probiotic organisms require certain characteristics to enable them to exert maximum therapeutic effects. These qualities are summarized in Table 105.1. Of these characteristics, there are some that are considered almost a prerequisite for a probiotic strain to have therapeutic effects. These are: (1) gastric acid and bile salt stability; (2) an ability to adhere to the intestinal mucosa; and (3) an ability to temporarily colonize the intes- tinal tract.34 Unfortunately, many commercially available probiotic supplements and yogurts contain strains that do not exhibit these vital characteristics. If a probiotic strain does not exhibit these characteris- tics, then it will have only a limited capacity to interact with host cells.

## Probiotics in Use

There are many different microorganisms currently used as probiotics. Table 105.2 lists commonly used probiotic species. To better understand how bacteria are named and classified, the following discussion may be helpful. Genus is the first name of a bacterium (e.g., Lactobacillus). It is somewhat general and refers to a grouping of organisms based on similarity of qualities, such as physical characteristics, metabolic needs, and metabolic end products. Species is a bacterium’s second name (e.g., acidophilus). It is a much more narrow classification based on shared common characteristics that distinguish them from other species. Strain is an even more specific classification that divides members of the same species into subgroups based on several properties that these bacteria have in common that are distinct from other members of the species (e.g., strain LA5).37

## Issues in Probiotic Nomenclature

There are some changes in nomenclature, some more recent and some fairly antiquated, that should be noted to make better sense of probi- otic literature. • The species Lactobacillus bulgaricus is now referred to as Lactobacil- lus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus.38

• Lactobacillus bifidus (also known as “bifidus”) was renamed Bifidobacterium bifidum more than 30 years ago, yet the improper nomenclature is still sometimes used.38 • Many strains of bacteria that were once classified as Lactobacillus casei have been reclassified as strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (e.g., L. rhamnosus GG) or Lactobacillus paracasei.50 • Strains of Lactobacillus sporogenes have been renamed Bacillus coag- ulans (they are not true lactobacilli because they form spores).40 • Bacterial strains that were once classified as Lactobacillus acidophi- lus (often referred to as “acidophilus”) have now been divided into six species: L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, L. amylovorus, L. gallinarum, L. johnsonii, and L. crispatus.39 • Strains of Saccharomyces boulardii are now definitively regarded as a distinct group within the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae should be referred to as Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii.41,42 The improper nomenclature of S. boulardii is still widely used.

## Importance of Strain

Within each species of bacteria there is a multitude of strains. Some probiotic strains are resilient and strong, with a demonstrated capacity to survive passage through the upper GIT and have therapeutic actions, whereas others cannot even survive transit through the stomach.51 It is vital to note that just because one strain of bacteria in a given species has a proven action or characteristic, it does not mean that another strain will, too, even if they are closely related. Strains of bacteria within the same species can have significantly different actions, properties, and characteristics, as these are all essen- tially strain-specific qualities.52,53 For example, L. plantarum strain 299v has been shown to effectively reduce IBS symptoms,54 whereas administration of L. plantarum strain MF1298 actually worsens IBS symptoms.55 In another study, two strains of L. rhamnosus were used in a trial assessing their efficacy in the treatment of viral gastroenteritis. One strain was L. rhamnosus strain GG (LGG); the other was a strain found in a supplemental product (Lactophilus). LGG accelerated recovery from diarrhea, whereas the closely related strain did not.44 Thus to achieve the desired therapeutic result, it is imperative to pre- scribe the precise probiotic strains that have demonstrated therapeutic and clinical efficacy in the condition in question. Additionally, strains that work in one condition will not neces- sarily be effective in other conditions. For example, the multistrain preparation commonly referred to as Lab4 (containing L. acidophilus strains CUL21 and CUL60, B. bifidum CUL20, and B. lactis CUL34) appears effective in the management of IBS56 but is ineffective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated side effects.57 As another example, L. rhamnosus GG appears to be effective in the prevention of antibi- otic-associated side effects58 but not of any demonstrable benefit in urinary tract infections.59 Unfortunately, this strain specificity is not well known, leading to inaccurate extrapolations from the literature. For example, some supplement manufacturers will quote a study that used L. rhamnosus strain GG and then say that their probiotic supplement containing a strain of L. acidophilus or another strain of L. rhamnosus will do the same. This is quite incorrect. Unless proven, one cannot assume that a given strain of L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, or any other species of lactic acid bacteria will survive transit through the upper GIT, let alone col- onize the intestines or have specific therapeutic actions. They might, but, unless proven, it is impossible to know. Thus clinicians are urged to use well-researched probiotic strains whenever possible. By choosing well-researched strains, one can be assured of getting probiotics that have documented gastric acid and bile tolerance, can adhere to the intestinal mucosa, and can temporar- ily colonize the intestinal tract, as well as having proven therapeutic actions. This latter point is particularly important in improving the probability of achieving good clinical outcomes.

# COMMERCIAL FORMS

Probiotic organisms can be incorporated into supplements (pow- ders, capsules, tablets, oils, wafers) and foods (milk drinks, medicinal yogurts, fruit juices, confectionery bars, ice cream). All of these medi- ums essentially work as carriers for the probiotic organisms. Common probiotic delivery systems are compared in Table 105.3. Regardless of the form in which the microorganisms are consumed, for clinical efficacy, products containing probiotic organisms must provide live organisms in sufficient numbers to exert therapeutic effects. The quality of probiotic preparations depends on two main fac- tors: (1) the characteristics of the strains contained in the supplement; and (2) adequate viability, so that sufficient numbers of bacteria are viable at the point of consumption. Bacterial strains used in probiotic preparations should ideally demonstrate all the characteristics out- lined in Table 105.1 and have evidence of efficacy in treating the clin- ical condition in question (see “Clinical Applications” section later).

## 813CHAPTER 105 Probiotics

Viability at consumption depends on a number of factors, such as proper manufacturing and the “hardiness” of the strain and packag- ing and storing the product in the right amount of moisture and at the correct temperature. Some strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria do not respond well to freeze-drying (lyophilization), spray drying, or conventional frozen storage, and excessive temperature during pack- aging or storage can dramatically reduce viability. Typically, unless the product has been shown to be stable, refrigeration is necessary during storage and ideally during transport. Some products may not have to be refrigerated until after the bottle has been opened, however, and others not at all. Some manufacturers use enteric coatings on their tablets and cap- sules to improve survival through the acidic medium of the stomach. Research suggests that this practice does enhance survival through the upper GIT,60 although enteric coatings are not necessary if the strain has demonstrated satisfactory tolerance to gastric acid. Although there are a number of companies providing high-quality probiotic products, it can be difficult to sort through all of the manu- facturers’ claims of superiority. Additionally, market-basket surveys found that some supplements contain potentially pathogenic contam- inants,61 whereas others fail to contain the species and quantity of bac- teria listed on the label.62 Clearly, the clinician needs documentation of strain designation, strain characteristics, product viability, microbiological content, and strain-specific research before prescribing to his or her patients.


The clinical applications of probiotics have grown myriad in the past decade—from solely gastrointestinal conditions to a wide range of dis- eases and conditions affecting other body systems. Although they can still be used to promote optimal digestive health, they are more often being used to treat specific disease conditions.

## Antibiotic Use

Antibiotic use frequently results in significant perturbations in the GIT microbiota and GI adverse events, such as diarrhea.63 It was once believed that taking probiotics concurrently with antibiotics would be a waste of time and money, as the antibiotic would likely destroy all the administered probiotic bacteria. However, research conducted over the past 20 years clearly shows that concurrent administration of specific probiotic strains alongside antibiotics significantly decreases the incidence of antibiotic-related side effects. A number of meta-anal- yses have now shown conclusively that probiotics are an effective class of tools to decrease antibiotic-associated side effects.64-67 Table 105.4 highlights the research examining the effect of specific probiotic strains and strain combinations on antibiotic-related GI adverse events, pri- marily antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Not all probiotic prepa- rations have been found to be effective, however. For example, the multistrain preparation commonly referred to as Lab4 (containing L. acidophilus strains CUL21 and CUL60, B. bifidum CUL20, and B. lactis CUL34) has been found to be ineffective in the prevention of antibiot- ic-associated side effects.57

## Abdominal Pain (Functional)

A meta-analysis of trials evaluating L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) in the treat- ment of functional abdominal pain in children found LGG effective. LGG supplementation was associated with a significantly higher rate of treatment responders (defined as no pain or a decrease in pain intensity) in the overall population of children with abdominal pain-related func- tional gastrointestinal disorders (three trials; n = 290; relative risk [RR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.08–1.59) and in the IBS subgroup (three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], n = 167; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.27–2.27, NNT 4, 95% CI 3–8). There was also a significant decrease in the perception of pain intensity in children with functional abdominal pain.62 Other probiotic strains, such as B. infantis 35624 and the combina- tion of B. lactis Bi-07 and L. acidophilus NCFM, have been found to be ineffective in reducing functional abdominal pain, although the latter combination did improve abdominal bloating scores.68,69

## Atopic Eczema

The intestinal microbiota plays a major protective role against the development of allergy through its ability to reduce antigen trans- port through the intestinal mucosa and induce oral tolerance.70 Consequently, probiotics have been theorized to have a protective role in the prevention and/or management of atopic dermatitis (AD) and eczema.71 A number of clinical trials have investigated probiotic ther- apy to prevent atopic eczema development, and some have evaluated the efficacy of probiotic therapy in the treatment of atopic eczema.

## Prevention of Atopic Eczema

The initial ground-breaking research detailing the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of atopic eczema used the probiotic strain L. rhamno- sus GG (LGG).72 This initial positive result led to a number of follow-up trials—some using the same strain and others evaluating other probiotic strains. A 2015 meta-analysis found that probiotics, as a class of agents, are effective in reducing the risk of atopic eczema. Meta-analysis found a reduced risk of eczema when used by women during the last trimester of pregnancy (RR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.84), when probiotics were used by breastfeeding mothers (RR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.47–0.69), or when given directly to infants (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68–0.94).73 The conclusions of this review have been criticized, however, because the authors combined the data from a number of different probiotic strains into a single anal- ysis—a process that does not provide meaningful guidance to consum- ers or practitioners about which probiotic strain should be used in this clinical scenario. In fact, a meta-analysis by strain on the only probiotic preparation with more than one RCT for this application (LGG) found a nonsignificant decreased relative risk of eczema at 12 to 24 months (RR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.42–1.10).74 A number of other probiotic strains have been evaluated for their effectiveness in the prevention of atopic eczema with differing results. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Taylor et al. administered L. acidophilus strain LAVRI-A1 (3 × 109 CFU/day) to infants at high risk of allergic disease for the first 6 months of life. At both 6 and 12 months, the incidence of atopic dermatitis was similar in both the probiotic and placebo groups. However, the proportion of children with a positive skin prick test and atopic eczema was signifi- cantly higher in the probiotic group (P = 0.045) at 12 months, as was the rate of allergen sensitization (P = 0.030). Hence, this strain was not only ineffective in decreasing the incidence of atopic dermatitis development, it appears to have actually increased allergen sensitiza- tion, despite promising preliminary in vitro results.75 Abrahamsson et al. conducted a double-blind, randomized, place- bo-controlled trial investigating the role of L. reuteri strain BioGaia in the prevention of atopic dermatitis development (n = 232). The moth- ers received L reuteri BioGaia (1 × 108 CFU) daily from gestational week 36 until delivery. Their babies then continued with the same product from birth until 12 months of age. The incidence of eczema was found to be similar in both groups at 2 years of age. Infants in the probiotic group did, however, have less immunoglobulin E-associated eczema (8 vs. 20%; P = 0.02) and in infants with allergic mothers, less skin-prick test reactivity (14 vs. 31%; P = 0.02).76 Wickens et al. performed a randomized, double-blind, place- bo-controlled trial to assess the effect of two different probiotic strains

on the development of atopic eczema. Pregnant women with an atopic family history were randomized to take L. rhamnosus HN001 or B. lactis strain HN019 or placebo daily from 35 weeks’ gestation until months if breastfeeding, and their infants were randomized to receive the same treatment from birth to 2 years (n = 474). Infants in the L. rhamnosus HN001 group had a 49% reduced risk of eczema develop- ment at 2 years of age (95% CI 0.30–0.85; P = 0.01). On the other hand, there was no reduction in eczema risk in infants receiving B. lactis strain HN019.77 In another randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, the efficacy of L. paracasei F-19 was evaluated. In this trial, the probiotic was administered to the infant (n = 179) directly at the time of weaning (mixed into food). Infants consumed the probiotic agent (1 × 108 CFU/ day) from 4 to 13 months of age. Probiotic supplementation resulted in a significantly reduced cumulative incidence of eczema at 13 months of age (11 vs. 22%; P < 0.05) and an improved Th1/Th2 ratio.78 In a further double-blind trial, women (n = 415) were randomized to receive either placebo or a probiotic milk (containing L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus La5, and B. lactis Bb12) from 36 weeks’ gestation to 3 months postnatally during breastfeeding. At 2 years old, the odds ratio (OR) for the cumulative incidence of atopic eczema was 0.51 in the probiotic group compared with the placebo (95% CI 0.30–0.87; P = 0.013). There were no significant effects on rates of asthma or atopic sensitization.79

## Treatment of Atopic Eczema

To determine whether probiotics, as a class of agents, are efficacious in treating atopic eczema (AE), Kim et al. performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. Twenty-five eligible studies were located, including 1599 subjects. Significant differences in eczema severity (SCORAD values) favoring probiotics over placebo were observed for the total population (mean −4.51; 95% CI −6.78 to −2.24), in children aged 1 to 18 years old (mean −5.74; 95% CI −7.27 to −4.20), and in adults (mean −8.26; 95% CI −13.28 to −3.25). However, the effective- ness of probiotics as a whole in infants (< 1 year old) was not demon- strated.80 Individual probiotic preparations that have been evaluated in the treatment of atopic eczema are highlighted in the following section. A randomized, double-blind study of 56 young children (aged 6–18 months) with moderate or severe atopic AE found that treatment with L. fermentum VRI-003 PCC (1 × 109 CFU; twice daily) produced a sig- nificant reduction in the SCORAD index. At week 16, 92% of children receiving the probiotic had a SCORAD index that was significantly better than baseline compared with 63% in the placebo group (P = 0.01).81 A randomized, controlled trial conducted by Sistek et al. found that a combination of two probiotic strains (L. rhamnosus HN001 and B. lactis HN019) given to children with established AE effectively reduced the SCORAD index among the food-sensitized children (P = 0.047) but not in the group as a whole. Children in this study received 2 × CFU/day of the probiotic combination or placebo.82

## Viral Gastroenteritis—Prevention

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, infants admitted to a chronic medical hospital (average duration of stay days) ingested formula that was supplemented with either placebo or a combination probiotic. The probiotic contained B. lactis Bb12 (1.9 × 108 CFU/g powdered formula) and the TH-4 strain of Streptococcus thermophilus (0.14 × 108 CFU/g powdered formula). Probiotic sup- plementation was found to significantly reduce diarrhea incidence (7 vs. 31%; P = 0.035) and rotavirus shedding (10 vs. 39%; P = 0.025).83 Another randomized, controlled trial found the administration of L. rhamnosus GG to hospitalized children to reduce the risk of rotavi- rus gastroenteritis by 87% (P = 0.02).84

<!-- chunk -->

## Viral Gastroenteritis—Treatment

A meta-analysis of eight RCTs (n = 988) by Szajewska et al. found that supplementation of L. rhamnosus GG significantly reduced duration of rotavirus diarrhea by 2.1 days in children (P = 0.006), and the risk of diarrhea lasting > 7 days was reduced by 75% (P = 0.01). The authors did caution, however, that the heterogeneity and methodological con- siderations of the studies limited the strength of the conclusions.85 To determine the dose-dependent effect of L. rhamnosus Lcr35 (Lcr35) on fecal rotavirus shedding, Fang et al. conducted an open-la- bel randomized study. Twenty-three children with rotavirus gastro- enteritis were treated for 3 days with either a placebo, a low dose of Lcr35 (2 × 108 CFU/day), or a high dose (6 × 108 CFU/day). Only the high-dose group experienced a significant reduction of rotavirus levels in stool samples (an 86% decrease after 3 days).86 A randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of two different doses of L. reuteri DSM 17938 (1 × 1010 CFU/day or × 107 CFU/day) with placebo in children with rotavirus-associated diarrhea (n = 66) found that probiotic treatment reduced the duration of viral gastroenteritis-induced diarrhea from 2.5 days in the placebo group to 1.9 days in the low-dose group and 1.5 days in high dose group (P = 0.01). By the second day of treatment, watery diarrhea per- sisted in 80% of the placebo, 70% of the low-dose group, and 48% of the large-dose group (P = 0.04, large dosage vs. placebo).87 Another double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study eval- uated the efficacy of the multistrain probiotic preparation (VSL#3) in the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in children. Two hundred and thirty children were enrolled in the trial. By day 2, a lower mean stool frequency and improved stool consistency was noted in the VSL#3 group (both P ≤ 0.05). On day 4 of treatment, 89% of VSL#3-treated children were recovered versus 40% of controls (P < 0.001).88

## Travelers’ Diarrhea

Travelers’ diarrhea (TD) is the most common health problem in those visiting developing countries, affecting between 20% and 50% of tourists. Although it is usually short-lived and self-limiting, travelers’ diarrhea represents a considerable socioeconomic burden for both the traveler and the host country. The most common enteropathogen is E. coli, but a number of other microorganisms are also implicated.89 Recent research has highlighted the causative role of TD in the devel- opment of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.90 Thus agents capable of preventing the development of TD are much needed. Clinical trials with probiotics have thus far produced mixed results. In an attempt to clarify the role of probiotics in the prevention of TD, McFarland conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the area. Combining the data from the 12 included RCTs indicated that probiotics (as a class of agents) appear to significantly prevent the development of TD, with a pooled relative risk of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79–0.91; P < 0.001). Although the data for probiotics as a whole were positive, there were a number of preparations found ineffective—L. fermentum VRI-003,91 Lactinex (unspecified strains of L. acidophilus and L. helveticus in combination),92 and an unspecified strain of L. aci- dophilus (Antibiophilus-Kapseln).93 Only strains with proven efficacy in TD should be used clinically (see later). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by Black et al., the combination of L. acidophilus La5 and B. lactis Bb12 was eval- uated for the prevention of TD. Ninety-five Danish travelers touring Egypt took part in the trial and consumed either placebo or a probiotic preparation containing 1.8 × 1010 CFU/day of a combination of L. aci- dophilus La5, B. lactis Bb12, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and S. ther- mophilus starting 2 days before travel. The first two strains constituted 90% of the mixture. The number of tourists developing diarrhea was significantly reduced in the probiotic group—from 71% in controls to 43% (P = 0.019). This equated to a protection rate of 39.4%.94 In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy of LGG (2 × 109 CFU/day) in the prophylaxis of TD, 245 sub- jects traveling from Finland to developing nations were enrolled. The risk of TD development for subjects taking LGG was reduced by 47% compared with the placebo-treated controls (P = 0.05).95 Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial design, Kollaritsch et al. investigated the efficacy of two different doses of S. cerevisiae var. boulardii strain Biocodex (250 mg/day and 500 mg/day) in the prevention of TD. Four hundred and six Austrian subjects trav- eling to tropical locales were enrolled. The rate of TD in the placebo group was 42.6%, versus 33.6% in the low-dose group and 31.8% in the high-dose group. This equates to a 21% reduction in incidence in the 250 mg/day group (P < 0.007) and 25% reduction with 500 mg/day (P < 0.002) compared with placebo.93 In another placebo-controlled double-blind study, two doses (250 and 1000 mg) of S. cerevisiae var. boulardii strain Biocodex (ScB) were administered prophylactically to 3000 Austrian travelers. A signifi- cant reduction in the incidence of diarrhea was observed, with success depending directly on the rigorous use of the preparation. A tendency was noted for ScB to have a regional effect, which was particularly marked in North Africa and in Turkey. The effect was also dose-depen- dent, with participants taking the higher dose of probiotics experienc- ing the lowest incidence of travelers’ diarrhea (29%); little difference was observed between low-dose supplementation (34%) and placebo (39%). The treatment was well tolerated.96

## Clostridium-difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)

Clostridium difficile is a common cause of diarrhea associated with treatment with antimicrobial and/or antibiotic medication and can potentially progress to colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and death. Despite antimicrobial therapy, recurrence is common, and increasingly, probiotic supplementation has been inves- tigated as a potential treatment for CDAD. A meta-analysis by Johnston et al. assessed 20 RCTs (n = patients) that used probiotic preparations in the management of CDAD. Pooling the data on all the probiotic preparations found a 66% reduced incidence of CDAD (RR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.24–0.49) in patients taking probiotics concurrently with antibiotics. However, not all pro- biotic preparations were found to be effective. Probiotic preparations that have demonstrated efficacy in ran- domized, controlled trials for the prevention or treatment of CDAD include S. cerevisiae var. boulardii Biocodex,98 L. plantarum 299v,99 L. casei DN-114 001,100 and the combination of L. acidophilus CL 1285, L. casei LBC80R, and L. rhamnosus CLR2.101

## Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci

Over the past 15 to 20 years, there has been a rapid increase in the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). This has been associated with the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. VRE can be involved in the pathogenesis of persistent, nosocomial infections that often have poor outcomes. Additionally, they have the capacity to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes to other organisms. Nonantibiotic control measures of VRE are thus much needed. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was per- formed to assess the efficacy of a medicinal yogurt containing L. rham- nosus GG (LGG), L. acidophilus La5, and B. lactis Bb12 in the eradication of VRE. Twenty-seven VRE-positive hospital inpatients were randomly allocated to consume either a yogurt containing LGG (100 g daily for weeks) or an equivalent amount of pasteurized yogurt. All subjects who received the probiotic yogurt were cleared of VRE compared with only 8% of controls (P < 0.001).102 On the other hand, two trials investigat- ing the capacity of LGG on its own to decrease VRE colonization found this strain in isolation unable to clear or reduce VRE colonization.103,104

## Chemotherapy-Induced Diarrhea

In an open-label trial, subjects (n = 150) undergoing 5-fluoroura- cil-based chemotherapy for colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive supplementation with L. rhamnosus GG (1–2 × 1010 CFU/ day). L. rhamnosus GG supplementation was associated with a 41% reduced frequency of severe diarrhea (P = 0.027), an 83% reduction in abdominal discomfort scores (P = 0.025), and 55% decreased fre- quency in bowel toxicity-induced dose reductions (P = 0.0008) com- pared with untreated controls.105

## AIDS-Related Diarrhea

In a small double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 24 women with AIDS/ HIV, aged 18 to 44 years, who were not being treated with antiretrovirals and had moderate diarrhea, were given either a yogurt supplemented with the probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 or an unsupplemented yogurt for 15 days. Women receiving the supple- mented probiotic–yogurt experienced less diarrhea, flatulence, and nau- sea than those receiving the control yogurt. All probiotic-treated subjects were free of diarrhea after 15 days’ treatment versus 9% of controls. Additionally, there was an increase in CD4 counts observed in probi- otic-treated subjects compared with a decrease in controls (P < 0.02).106 In an open-label trial, 17 HIV-positive patients with chronic diarrhea were given S. cerevisiae var. boulardii Biocodex strain (3 g/day) for days. The mean number of stools per day decreased from 9.0 on enroll- ment to 2.1 on day 15. Patients gained a mean of 3.6 kg during the trial.107

## Constipation

Constipation affects a significant proportion of the population. Probiotics have long been touted as useful for the treatment of con- stipation, and recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy for some probiotic strains. In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (14 trials, including 1182 sub- jects), combining the data from all of the different probiotic strains found a significant reduction in whole-gut transit time (12.4 h reduc- tion; 95% CI: −22.3 to −2.5 h) and increased stool frequency by an extra 1.3 bowel movements/week (95% CI: 0.7–1.9 bowel movements/ week). Stool consistency was also significantly improved.108 Strains that have shown consistent efficacy in trials to date include B. lactis DN-173 010,109 E. coli Nissle 1917,110 B. lactis Bb12,111 L. reu- teri DSM 17938,112 and the combination of B. breve PXN 25, B. longum PXN 30, L. acidophilus PXN 35, L. casei PXN 37, L. rhamnosus PXN 54, and S. thermophilus PXN 66.113 Another systematic review evaluating the capacity of probiotics to specifically speed intestinal transit time found that probiotics, as a whole, could significantly reduce intestinal transit time (P < 0.0001). Large effect sizes were seen in particular with two probiotic strains—B. lactis HN019 and B. lactis DN-173 010.114

## Immune Enhancement

The potential role of probiotics in the enhancement of immune func- tion has been under investigation over the past few decades. The process started with in vitro and animal research, followed by stud- ies evaluating the effects of probiotic administration on immune cell function in human subjects. More recently, well-conducted, human trials with hard outcomes have finally been published. In a recent Cochrane review, Hao et al. assessed the data from randomized con- trolled trials (12 trials; n = 3720) that had investigated the role of pro- biotics for the prevention and treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Probiotics were found to be better than pla- cebo in reducing the number of participants experiencing episodes of acute URTIs ([OR] of at least one URTI = 0.53; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76; P < 0.001) and in reducing the mean duration of an acute URTI episode (mean difference [MD] = −1.89 days; 95% CI −2.03 to −1.75 days; P < 0.001). Antibiotic prescription rates for acute URTIs was also signifi- cantly reduced (OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.94), as was the incidence of cold-related school absence (OR = 0.10; 95% CI 0.02–0.47).115 Data suggest, however, that some, but not all, probiotic preparations will demonstrate the capacity to enhance immune function and decrease risk and duration of respiratory tract infections. A number of probiotic strains that have demonstrated the capacity to reduce the incidence of infections and/or shorten their duration are detailed in Table 105.5.

## Infantile Colic

Infantile colic is defined as excessive crying or fussing in infants with- out apparent cause. Probiotics have been suggested as potential strat- egies to treat this common clinical scenario. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Bird et al. evaluated the effect of probiotics on the symptoms of infantile colic. Five trials (n = 317) were included in this systematic review. Only two probiotic strains were evaluated—L. reu- teri DSM 17938 and its nearly identical parent strain L. reuteri ATCC 55730. Analysis of response rates showed that infants receiving the L. reuteri strains had a 2.3-fold greater chance of having a 50% or greater decrease in crying/fussing time compared with controls (P = 0.01).116

## Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Although the etiology of IBS is still debated, there is growing evidence that there is a persistent, mild inflammatory state with changes in muco- sal function or structure and an associated imbalance in the gastrointes- tinal microbiota.117 Dysbiosis has long been theorized to play a role in the pathophysiology of IBS, and the first trial conducted investigating the efficacy of probiotics in IBS was published in 1955.118 Many trials have been conducted since this time, as have a number of systematic reviews. Didari et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of probiot- ics in the treatment of IBS. Twenty-four RCTs were included in the review, but only 15 of these (n = 1793) had data that could be com- bined into a meta-analysis. Subjects taking probiotics were nearly twice as likely to respond with a reduction in abdominal pain as those taking placebo (RR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.14–3.36; P = 0.001) and more than twice as likely to have an improvement in their global IBS symptom score (RR = 2.43; 95% CI 1.13–5.21; P = 0.02). They were also twice as likely to report adequate relief of their IBS symptoms (RR = 2.14; 95% CI 1.08–4.26; P = 0.03).119 Once again, not all probiotic strains have been shown to be effec- tive, with studies using L. rhamnosus GG (in isolation),120 L. salivar- ius UCC4331,121 and L. acidophilus NCFM122 failing to demonstrate

positive results. Probiotic preparations that have shown efficacy in the treatment of IBS are detailed in Table 105.6.

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Probiotics are also being used as adjunctive therapy for the two main inflammatory bowel diseases—Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Overall, current research indicates a limited role for pro- biotics in CD, whereas the results for UC are more promising.

<!-- chunk -->

## Crohn’s Disease

Derwa et al. in their systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs found no benefit of probiotics (as a whole) in inducing remission of active CD, in preventing relapse of quiescent CD, or in preventing relapse of CD after surgically induced remission.123 However, there is some preliminary supportive evidence for one probiotic strain. In an open-label study, Guslandi et al. compared S. cerevisiae var. boulardii Biocodex plus mesalazine versus mesalazine alone and found that adjunctive probiotic treatment resulted in fewer relapses (6% vs. 38%; P = 0.04). Given this promising preliminary research on S. cerevisiae var. boulardii Biocodex (ScB) in CD, the strain was evaluated using a more rigorous ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design. One hundred and sixty-five subjects with CD that was currently in remission after treatment with steroids or salicylates were randomly allocated to receive either pla- cebo or probiotic (1 g/day) for 12 months. Over the 12 months, the relapse rates were 47.5% in the probiotic group and 53.2% in the placebo group (a nonsignificant difference). The median time to relapse did not differ significantly between patients given probiotics (40.7 weeks) versus placebo (39.0 weeks). There were also no significant differences between groups in mean Crohn’s disease activity index scores or erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rates or in median levels of C-reactive protein. A post-hoc analysis did reveal, however, that nonsmokers given ScB were less likely to expe- rience a relapse of CD than nonsmokers given placebo (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07–0.70; P = 0.01).124 The latter result requires confirmation in future research to ensure it was not a random finding, but in the meantime, a trial of this probiotic strain would be warranted in nonsmoking CD patients.

## Ulcerative Colitis

A recent meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials assessed the effect of probiotics on remission induction and maintenance in UC. Thirteen RCTs were included in the analysis. Seven reports evaluated remission rates (n = 399). When combined (8 studies; n = 709), the adjunct use of probiotics alongside standard care did not significantly alter remission rates. There was, however, marked heterogeneity in the results. Compared with the placebo group, the use of probiotics was found to significantly reduce the UC recurrence rate (recurrence rate: 0.69, 95% CI 0.47–1.01;

P = 0.05). Heterogeneity was again observed. The results suggest that concurrent us of probiotics provides little additional benefit in inducing remission in a UC flare but that probiotic auxiliary therapy is much better than nonprobiotics therapy for maintenance of remission.125 The signif- icant heterogeneity observed in this study, which should have precluded the conduction of a meta-analysis, was most likely caused by the all-too- common error of combining research conducted on different probiotic strains, as each strain must be viewed as a separate therapeutic agent. Probiotic strains and specific preparations that have shown efficacy in the management of UC are detailed in Tables 105.7 and 105.8.

## Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease comprises a spectrum of diseases rang- ing from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Probiotics have been proposed as a treatment option because of their modulating effect on the gut flora that could influence the gut- liver axis, and there are now considerable data from animal models in support of this idea and some promising human data. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supplemen- tation of obese children (n = 20; mean age 10.7 years) with persisting hypertransaminasemia and ultrasonographic changes suggestive of NAFLD, with L. rhamnosus GG (1.2 × 1010 CFU/day) for 8 weeks resulted in a decrease in alanine aminotransferase concentration (P = 0.03) and in antipeptidoglycan-polysaccharide antibody levels (P = 0.03). Alanine aminotransferase levels normalized in 80% of LGG-treated subjects.126

## Colon Cancer

In vitro and animal data have supported the potential use of probiot- ics, as a general class of agents, to prevent colorectal cancer—mainly via their antimicrobial effects against carcinogen-producing microor- ganisms, direct antimutagenic properties, and via alteration of tumor differentiation processes.127 One strain with supportive human data is L. casei Shirota. A ran- domized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of this probiotic strain in the prevention of colorectal cancer in patients (n = 398) who had had at least two colorectal tumors removed previously. Daily consumption of the probiotic over a 4-year period resulted in a significant reduction in the occurrence of colorectal tumors with moderate or severe atypia compared with the dietary instruction–only group (P < 0.05).128

## Mastitis

Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast that may, or may not, be associated with infection. It is, however, a common reason for premature cessation of breastfeeding.129 Recent research has found some probiotic strains to be of benefit in the treatment of mastitis and the prophylaxis of recurrent mastitis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 352 women with lactational mastitis were allocated into one of three groups—antibi- otics, L. fermentum CECT5716, or L. salivarius CECT (both at 1.0 × CFU/day). After 3 weeks’ treatment, both probiotic strains were found to be superior to antibiotics in decreasing levels of pathogenic bacteria in breast milk, increasing lactobacilli counts in breast milk, and decreasing breast pain scores (all P < 0.001). They also significantly reduced the rate of recurrence compared with antibiotics—10.5% in the L. fermentum CECT5716 group and 7.1% in the L. salivarius CECT5713 group versus 30.7% in the antibiotic group (both P < 0.001).130 In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial, women (n = 20) with antibiotic-resistant mastitis were allocated to receive either pla- cebo or a probiotic preparation (L. salivarius CECT5713 and L. gasseri CECT5714; 2.0 × 1010 CFU/day) for 14 days. All mastitis signs were eliminated by day 14 in the probiotic group, whereas mastitis per- sisted in all women in the control group. There was also an ∼ 100-fold decrease in milk staphylococcal counts in the probiotic group.131

postpartum obesity. In the first trimester of pregnancy, 256 women were randomly assigned to receive no dietary counseling or nutritional coun- seling (low-fat and high-fiber diet) plus probiotics (LGG and Bb12; 2.0 × 1010 CFU/day) or counseling plus placebo. Interventions lasted until the end of exclusive breastfeeding for up to 6 months. At 6 months’ postpar- tum, the risk of central adiposity (defined as waist circumference 80 cm or more) was lowered in women in the diet/probiotics group compared with the control/placebo group (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11–0.85; P = 0.023 adjusted for baseline body mass index), whereas the diet/placebo group did not differ from the controls (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38–2.68; P = 0.994). The number needed to treat with diet/probiotics to prevent one woman from developing a waist circumference of 80 cm or more was four.132 At 12 months postpartum, central obesity occurred in 25% of diet/probiotic subjects versus 43% in the diet/placebo group. The proportion of body fat was also 3.5% lower in the diet/probiotic group (P = 0.018).133

## Urogenital Infections

Probiotics are widely used in the treatment and prevention of urogeni- tal infections. They can be administered both orally and locally, with multiple trials supporting their use. There are additional criteria needed for probiotic strains to be efficacious in urogenital applications. Strains must demonstrate the capacity to adhere to uroepithelial and vaginal cells, temporarily colonize the vagina, inhibit urogenital pathogen growth and/ or attachment, and ideally should produce hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid. Strains that will be administered orally must also have sufficient tol- erance to gastric acid and bile salts and the verified capacity to colonize the vagina after oral intake.134 Probiotic strains that do not exhibit these characteristics are unlikely to be therapeutic for urogenital applications. The mechanisms by which some Lactobacillus strains reduce bacte- rial vaginosis, vaginal candidiasis, and UTIs appear to involve a combi- nation of antiadhesion factors, byproducts such as hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and lactic acid (both D- and L-forms), and destruction of urogenital pathogen biofilms, as well as immune modulation or modi- fication of vaginal epithelial cell cytokine production.30,135-137

dysbiosis)—specifically a depletion of the indigenous lactobacilli pop- ulation. Administration of exogenous lactobacilli strains has thus been an area of research interest.138 A Cochrane systematic review conducted in 2009 included four RCTs that examined probiotic agents in the treatment of BV. Analysis suggested that probiotics were effective in enhancing microbiological cure rates with the oral metronidazole/probiotic (L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14) regimen (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03–0.26) and the probiotic (unspecified strain of L. acidophilus)/estriol preparation (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00–0.47) showing effectiveness. The authors cautioned, however, that larger, well-designed trials were needed before any firm conclusions could be made.139 Research on specific strains that have demonstrated efficacy are highlighted later in Table 105.9.

## Urinary Tract Infections

Grin et al. performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to review the data on the potential effectiveness of lactobacilli in the pre- vention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women. Five random- ized, controlled trials were included in the analysis. Combining the data from all the trials (294 patients) found no preventative effect of lactobacilli supplementation (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.58–1.25; P = 0.41). However, a sensitivity analysis was performed, excluding studies using ineffective strains and studies testing for safety only. Data from patients in two trials were included. A statistically significant decrease in recurrent UTI was found in patients given lactobacilli, denoted by the pooled risk ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.26–0.99; P = 0.05).140 A significant reduction in UTI recurrence rate was reported in a randomized double-blind study involving 55 premenopausal women. The study investigated the effectiveness of treatment for 1 year with a weekly suppository containing either a combination of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum B-54 or a Lactobacillus growth factor (skim milk). Treatment resulted in the UTI rate decreasing by 73% and 79%, respectively, with no adverse effects reported.141 A recent, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial compared the efficacy of 12 months of prophylaxis with antibiotics (trimetho- prim-sulfamethoxazole; 480 mg/day) or oral probiotics (2 × 109 CFU/ day of a combination of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14) in the prevention of UTIs in postmenopausal women with recurrent cystitis (n = 252). The number of symptomatic UTIs over the 12-month treat- ment period was 2.9 in the antibiotic group and 3.3 in the lactoba- cilli group—a between-treatment difference of 0.4 episodes (95% CI −0.4–1.5) or 13.8%. In the year preceding the trial, the subjects experi- enced a mean of 6.9 UTIs. The percentage of patients with at least one UTI at 12 months was 69.3% in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 79.1% in the lactobacilli group. The median times to first recurrence were 6 and 3 months, respectively. After 12 months of tri- methoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, all urinary E. coli isolates of asymptomatic women were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxaz- ole and trimethoprim. Probiotic use, however, was not associated with increased antibiotic resistance. The authors stated that this lactobacilli combination may be an acceptable alternative for the prevention of UTIs, especially in women who dislike taking antibiotics.142 Although probiotic therapy appeared slightly less effective than antibiotic pro- phylaxis in postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs, their use does not damage the GIT microbiota or create antibiotic resistant organisms.143

## Vaginal Candidiasis

In theory, supplying specific lactobacilli strains to the vagina in women with vaginal candidiasis (VC) or at risk of VC should help manage or prevent the infection. Lactobacilli can impair the growth of C. albicans via the production of lactic acid, which creates a low-pH environment resulting in suppressed fungal growth. Cocultures of some lactobacilli strains with C. albicans has revealed inhibitory effects. Transcriptome analyses showed increased expression of stress-related genes and lower expression of genes involved in antifungal resistance.136 Research to date, however, has produced mixed results. Some probiotic preparations have been shown to be clearly inef- fective in the treatment of VC. For example, a combination of L. rhamnosus HN001 and B. longum Bl-05 and a propriety preparation, Femilac (unspecified strains of L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii ssp bul- garicus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus).144 Other preparations have shown some degree of efficacy, however. Those preparations that have shown efficacy in the treatment of VC are detailed in Table 105.10, although it should be noted that most of these trials were small in size.

## Toxin Reduction

Some Lactobacillus strains are able to break down aldehydes in the body through enhancement of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase.145 In addition, some probiotic strains can bind to aflatoxin B 1 in the intestine, preventing the toxin from causing damage to the liver and other organs.146


The dosage of probiotic foods and supplements is based solely upon the number of live organisms present in the product. Successful results have been attained in clinical trials using between 107 and 1011 CFU per day.147-149 Interestingly, it appears that 100 times fewer viable bacteria need to be given in a dairy medium than in a freeze-dried supplement to achieve similar numbers of live bacteria in the lower bowel.63 Dairy appears to work as an ideal transport medium for the bacteria, enhanc- ing their survival through the upper GIT.50


Supplements are best consumed with meals to take advantage of the increased alkalinity of the gastric environment (which equates to greater bacterial survival).150 A dosage of 108 bacteria per sitting is often men- tioned in the probiotic literature as the minimum quantity of bacteria needed to produce therapeutic effects.50,150 Additionally, there have been a handful of studies that demonstrated therapeutic effects using 107 to 108 viable bacteria per dose.147,148,151 However, most of the successful probiotic research used greater than or equal to 109 CFU per dose. The minimum concentration of probiotic bacteria needed to achieve therapeutic effects appears to be strain dependent, in that for some strains (e.g., L. reuteri DSM 17938) 107 bacteria is a sufficient quantity to produce beneficial effects,148 whereas for other strains, 109 viable bacteria is needed (e.g., L. rhamnosus GG).63 This situation, unfortunately, makes it hard to give firm dosage recommendations, as the minimum effective dosage appears to differ by strain. Thus it is best practice to ensure that supplements contain bacteria in concentrations greater than or equal to 109 CFU per dose, unless research has demonstrated that the specific strain contained in the supplement is effective in smaller amounts. Therefore the dosage of viable bacteria given in supplemental forms should generally be 109 to 1011 bacteria per dose. If a formulation contains multiple strains, each strain must be present in amounts greater than or equal to 109, because dosages of less than 109 CFU may not produce therapeutic effects. Studies evaluating a potential dose-response have to date been extremely limited. Results do suggest, however, that at least for the areas of acute viral diarrhea and antibiotic-associated diarrhea, there is a probable dose-dependent effect—with doses of > 1010 CFU/day gen- erally more effective. Perhaps not surprisingly, fecal concentrations also correlated well with oral dosing regimens for most probiotic strains, with higher oral dosing equating to higher fecal concentrations.152

## Dosage in Dairy Mediums

The minimum dosage of viable bacteria needed in a dairy medium is 108 CFU of each strain per dose. Therapeutic yogurts contain greater than or equal to 106 viable bacteria per milliliter, thus a 100 g serving (approximately 1/2 cup) will provide sufficient probiotic bacteria for therapeutic effects.150 Unfortunately, many so-called “acidophilus” and/or “bifidus” yogurts do not contain this minimum level.153 Only yogurt brands that are guaranteed to contain this level of viable bacte- ria or those that have done so in market-basket surveys should be used. A serving of yogurt containing less than 108 viable bacteria is unlikely to have any medicinal effects beyond its inherent nutritional content. A 100 g serving of yogurt contains only 3.1 to 3.5 g of lactose,154 which is well below the threshold level in individuals with lactose intol- erance. Hence, lactose-intolerant individuals should be able to con- sume the minimum amount of yogurt without ill effects.155


Lactobacilli have been consumed in large numbers throughout recorded history. The fermentation of foodstuffs is one of the oldest known uses of biotechnology, and even today, fermented foods and beverages constitute 20% to 40% of the human food supply world- wide. Thus lactobacilli have a long history of safe ingestion.5 In a recent review done to assess the safety of probiotics, Hempel et al. evaluated the adverse event profiles of 622 human trials that used probiotics from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Bacillus. Combining the data from those studies that reported adverse events, no increased risk of adverse events was observed in those subjects receiving probiotics

versus those taking a placebo (RR = 1.00; 95% CI 0.93–1.07). Nor was there an increase in gastrointestinal side effects, infections, or serious adverse events in probiotic-consuming subjects (RR = 1.06; 95% CI 0.97–1.16).149 Another systematic review looking specifically at probiotic safety in children evaluated the data from 74 clinical trials. Studies included healthy, immune-compromised, and obese subjects, as well as sub- jects with intestinal disorders, infections, and inflammatory disor- ders. Probiotics were found to be well-tolerated, with adverse events occurring more frequently in the placebo arm compared with those taking probiotics. The authors caution, however, that there was inad- equate reporting and classification of adverse events in many of the trials.150 Serious adverse events (such as bacteremia and fungemia) occur very rarely with probiotic use. Most cases have been associated with an immune-compromised state, impaired intestinal barrier function (such as in multiorgan failure), and the use of a central venous cathe- ter. As these conditions are often present in critically ill patients, pro- biotic treatment is contraindicated in this population.151 Despite a substantial increased use of probiotic supplements worldwide, epidemiological evidence suggests there has been no cor- responding increase in cases of bacteremia or fungemia as a conse- quence—further supporting their excellent safety profile.156


Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are negatively affected by alcohol and antibiotics.157,158 Although there is no evidence that the organism interferes with the activity of most antibiotics, the metabolism of sul- fasalazine, chloramphenicol palmitate, and phthalylsulfathiazole may be affected by some strains of L. acidophilus.159

## 824SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

antioxidant and free-radical-scavenging effects of PCOs were discov- ered by Masquelier in 1986.1 One study evaluated the free-radical-scavenging activity of PCOs and determined their inhibitory effects on xanthine oxidase (a pri- mary generator of oxygen-derived free radicals) and the lysosomal enzyme system (which governs the release of enzymes that can damage the connective tissue framework acting as a protective sheath around capillary walls).8 This research, summarized in Box 106.2, provides a detailed explanation of the vascular protective action of PCOs and a strong rationale for their use in vascular disease. In experimental models, the antioxidant activity of PCOs is much greater (approximately 50 times) than that of vitamin C and vitamin E. PCOs reduce lipid peroxidation9 and oxidation of low-density lipopro- tein (LDL),10 increase basal levels of α -tocopherol in endothelial cells, protect endothelium from oxidative stress induced by reactive nitrogen species,11,12 and protect endothelial cells from activated macrophage- induced glutathione depletion.13 From a cellular perspective, one of the most advantageous features of PCOs’ free-radical-scavenging activity is that, because of their chemical structure, they are incorporated into cell membranes. This physical characteristic, along with their ability to pro- tect against both water- and fat-soluble free radicals, provides significant cellular protection against damage by free radicals.8

## Ant-Iinflammatory Activity

PCOs affect the activity or expression of many inflammatory media- tors. In particular, PCOs suppress the nuclear factor (NF)- κ B pathway and activate the Nrf2 pathway. NF- κ B is a transcription factor acti- vated by cell stress and in turn regulates the expression of many genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as immune receptors (interferon-gamma [IFN- γ ] receptor, major histocompatibility com- plex [MHC], interleukin [IL]-2 receptor), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF- α ], IL-6, IL-1), adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]), prooxidant enzymes (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], induc- ible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]), and chemokines (monocyte che- moattractant protein [MCP]-1, MIP-1 α , IL-8). PCOs reduce oxidative stress and inflammation by suppressing NF- κ B and the mRNA expres- sion of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF- α and IL-1 β as well as the inflammatory prostaglandin products of COX-2. All of these effects support an anti-inflammatory and cancer preventive action for PCOs. Further supporting this action is that PCOs also activate Nrf2, a crucial transcriptional regulator needed to manufacture cytoprotective com- pounds in response to oxidative stress and inflammation. In vitro and in vivo studies also show that PCOs significantly directly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as well as the formation of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 β , and TNF- β , as well as histamine release from mast cells.14–17 When 10 volunteers received a single dose of 300 mg Pycnogenol, within 30 minutes, serum samples showed sta- tistically significant inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 (P < 0.002). Blood samples before and after 5 days of administration of 200 mg Pycnogenol to five healthy humans showed similar inhibition.

## Anticancer Activity

PCOs also prevent oxidative-induced DNA damage and promote DNA repair through direct antioxidant protection of DNA and prevention of the formation of highly mutagenic cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), enhancing the functions of DNA and CPD repair enzymes, promoting nucleotide excision repair mechanisms, and inhibiting DNA hypomethylation.18 PCOs exert a number of anticancer effects beyond their general antioxidant actions. PCOs were shown to selec- tively induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells, inhibit cell

## Cardiovascular Protection

In addition to protecting against oxidative damage to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and endothelial cells, PCOs increase erythrocyte membrane fluidity, reduce platelet aggregation, enhance endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity to increase nitric oxide levels, and inhibit angiotensin-I–converting enzyme (ACE) (Fig. 106.2).23–26 PCO extracts were shown to lower blood cholesterol levels and to shrink the size of cholesterol deposits in arteries in animal and human studies.1,27,28 PCOs also significantly lower C-reactive protein (CRP), a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In a double-blind study, 29 sub- jects in the Pycnogenol group and 26 patients in the placebo group had CRP levels higher than 3 mg/L at baseline.16 After 3-month treatment with Pycnogenol, at a dose of 100 mg/day, CRP significantly decreased plasma free radicals to 70.1% of baseline values. Specifically, plasma CRP levels decreased from 3.9 mg/L at baseline to 1.1 mg/L in the Pycnogenol group, whereas the control group had initial values of 3.9 mg/L that decreased to 3.6 mg/L. Fibrinogen levels were found to be lowered to 62.8% of initial values in the Pycnogenol group.

## Protection of Collagen and Cartilage

Collagen, the most abundant protein of the body, is responsible for maintaining the integrity of ground substance as well as the integ- rity of tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. Collagen is also the support structure of the dermis and blood vessels. PCOs are remarkable in their effects of supporting collagen structures and preventing col- lagen destruction. They affect collagen metabolism in several ways. They have the unique ability to cross-link collagen fibers, resulting in reinforcement of the natural cross-linking of collagen that forms the so-called collagen matrix of connective tissue.29,30 They also pro- tect against free radical damage with their potent antioxidant and free-radical-scavenging action, and they inhibit enzymatic cleavage of collagen by enzymes secreted by leukocytes during inflammation and microbes during infection.8,31 PCOs also prevent the release and syn- thesis of compounds that promote inflammation and allergies, such as histamine, serine proteases, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.1,2,32,33 PCOs also exert significant chondroprotective effects. In one con- trolled trial, 33 patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled for a knee arthroplasty either received 100 mg of Pycnogenol twice daily or no treatment (control group) 3 weeks before surgery. Results demonstrated that the intake of Pycnogenol downregulated the gene expression of various cartilage degradation markers in the patients’ chondrocytes; the decreases of MMP3, MMP13, and the proinflam- matory cytokine IL-1 β were statistically significant.34


The primary clinical applications of PCOs are in the treatment of the following conditions: • Antioxidant therapy • Asthma • Atherosclerosis, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 dia- betes • Attention deficit disorder and poor cognition • Male infertility and erectile function • Osteoarthritis • Periodontal disease • Venous insufficiency and capillary fragility • Visual function, retinopathy, and macular degeneration

## Antioxidant Therapy

PCOs exert broad-spectrum antioxidant activity and are clinically use- ful in many health conditions because of this action alone. In healthy human subjects, supplementation with PCOs for 6 weeks was shown to considerably improve the plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity score (ORAC).28 In one double-blind study, the effect of a standard- ized formulation of a PCO bound to phosphatidylcholine (Leucoselect Phytosome) was determined on the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation in a group of heavy smokers.35 Among oxidative indexes, the con- centration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was significantly reduced in subjects taking the PCO extract, and the lag phase was pro- longed compared with the values in subjects taking a placebo, as well as with baseline values. In another double-blind study, a group of 155 smokers was supple- mented with 50 mg Pycnogenol or a placebo for 8 weeks followed by

2 weeks’ cessation. Results showed that even at this dosage, Pycnogenol was able to significantly lower reactive oxygen species.36 Athletes can also gain benefits from PCOs. One study was designed to evaluate the effects of Pycnogenol on improving physical fitness in normal individuals and athletes training for a triathlon. The study was divided into two parts. In part 1 (Pycnogenol 100 mg/day), the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) was used to assess improvement in physical fitness during an 8-week preparation and training program. In part 2 (Pycnogenol 150 mg/day), the study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol supplementation in athletes in training for a triathlon. In part 1, results showed that there was a significant improvement in both males and females in the 2-mile running time, sit-ups, and push-ups within both groups, but the group using Pycnogenol per- formed statistically better than controls. In part 2, the swimming, biking, and running scores in both groups improved with training. However, the Pycnogenol group had more benefits in comparison with controls. The total triathlon time was 89 minutes and 44 seconds in Pycnogenol subjects versus 96 minutes and 5 seconds in controls. Controls improved their performance time by 4.6 minutes on average in comparison with an improvement of 10.8 minutes in Pycnogenol subjects. A significant decrease in cramps and running and postrun- ning pain was seen in the Pycnogenol group; there were no signifi- cant differences in controls. In Pycnogenol subjects, there was a lower increase in oxidative stress and a faster recovery.37 The performance benefits are not limited to the body; cognitive func- tion can also improve with PCO supplementation. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 101 elderly participants (60–85 years), consuming a daily dose of 150 mg of Pycnogenol for 3 months pro- duced significant improvements in several memory-based cognitive assessments and lipid peroxidation products (F2-isoprostanes) relative to the control group.38

## Asthma

PCOs appear to have an affinity for the lungs, indicating a possible benefit in lung disorders, including asthma. In a double-blind study involving 60 subjects (aged 6–18 years old) with mild to moderate asthma, patients were given either Pycnogenol (1 mg/lb body weight per day) or placebo for 3 months. Subjects were instructed to record their peak expiratory flow with an Assess Peak Flow Meter each eve- ning. Compared with subjects taking a placebo, the group that took Pycnogenol had significantly more improvement in pulmonary func- tion and asthma symptoms. Those in the Pycnogenol group were able to reduce or discontinue their use of rescue inhalers more often than the placebo group. There was also a significant reduction of urinary leukotrienes in the Pycnogenol group. The results of this study demon- strate the efficacy of Pycnogenol as an adjunct in the management of mild to moderate childhood asthma. Given the safety of PCOs, higher dosages (e.g., 2–3 mg/lb body weight) may produce better results than the lower dosage used in the clinical trial.39

PCO extracts, although in a supplement form, should be regarded as a necessary food in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. PCOs are similar to red wine components that are protective against heart disease, but they are more concentrated.40 The active components in red wine are thought to be proanthocyanidins. Flavonoid consumption, in general, has an inverse correlation with death due to heart attack.41 Both Pycnogenol and grape seed extract showed considerable ability to reduce cardio- vascular risk factors, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.42–44 However, even healthy subjects can take advantage of the beneficial effects of PCOs against cardiovascular risk factors. In one study, when 25 healthy subjects received Pycnogenol (150 mg/day) for 6 weeks, a significant increase in ORAC in plasma was observed throughout the supplementation period (returning to baseline after a 4-week wash- out period).28 Pycnogenol also significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in the plasma of two thirds of the subjects. Although the LDL changes reversed during washout, the HDL increase did not. Like other fla- vonoid sources, PCO extracts appear to be very helpful in improving endothelial function. Again, this effect may be particularly important in patients with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. In one double-blind study in 58 patients with hypertension who received supplementation with 100 mg PCO over 12 weeks, endothelin-1 con- centrations were significantly lower, and concentrations of 6-keto pros- taglandin F 1a in plasma were significantly higher, in the PCO group than in the placebo group. Additionally, the PCOs helped reduce the effective dose of the calcium antagonist nifedipine in a statistically sig- nificant manner.41 In another double-blind study, PCOs from grape seed extract were shown to produce a mild hypotensive effect (−11 mm Hg for both systolic and diastolic readings) in patients with metabolic syndrome at dosages of 150 and 300 mg/day.45 The benefits of PCOs in hypertension appear to be most significant in pre- to moderate hypertension. In one study, 36 subjects with pre- hypertension were randomized to ingest a juice containing 0 mg (pla- cebo) or 150 mg PCOs twice daily for 6 weeks preceded by a 2-week period where both groups took the placebo beverage and followed by 4-week no-beverage follow-up. Results showed that subjects taking the GSE for 6 weeks significantly reduced both their systolic (–5.6%) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (–4.7%). However, subjects with higher initial BP experienced greater BP reduction, nearly double the effect size. The majority of subjects were able to achieve normal BP mea- surements with PCO supplementation. In contrast, no effect was noted in the placebo group. BP returned to baseline levels after the 4-week discontinuation period of the PCO beverage, indicating that the results are only apparent while the PCOs are being consumed.46 PCOs may prove to be vitally important in preserving renal func- tion in hypertensive patients. One double-blind study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol as an adjunct to ACE inhibitor ramipril treat- ment of hypertensive patients presenting with early signs of renal failure. One group of 26 patients was medicated with 10 mg/day rami- pril only; a second group of 29 patients took Pycnogenol (150 mg/ day) in addition to the ACE inhibitor over 6 months. At the end of the trial, lower systolic and diastolic BPs were found in both groups, with a significant further reduction of diastolic pressure in the group given Pycnogenol in addition to ramipril. The study also showed that Pycnogenol was effective in improving BP in patients with metabolic syndrome. The study found that taking Pycnogenol as an adjunct to ramipril significantly further lowered systolic and diastolic BPs com- pared with the group taking ramipril alone. Although average blood pressure in the ramipril group was lowered to a borderline high of 128.2/90.2 mm Hg, the values in the group taking Pycnogenol with ramipril reached essentially normal values (122.2/85.3 mm Hg) after 6 months of treatment. Kidney function improved in both groups, as judged by a significant reduction of protein detected in collected urine. With ramipril alone, urinary protein decreased by 22%, and with the addition of Pycnogenol, it decreased by 52.7%. Further, the group taking Pycnogenol had a lower fasting blood glucose level, which was reduced from a high average value of 135.6 mg/dL at baseline to an essentially healthy reference value of 102.3 mg/dL after 6 months of treatment. Pycnogenol also led to a remarkable improvement of blood- flow velocity in the kidney arteries. Blood-flow velocity in the kidneys significantly increased with ramipril from 17.2 to 23.8 cm/s for systolic

and 4.2 to 2.0 cm/s for diastolic; the addition of Pycnogenol was more effective, improving blood flow from 18.2 to 27.2 cm/s for systolic and 4.1 to 9.8 cm/s for diastolic.47 Other studies showed that PCOs might lower fasting glucose levels. In a study of patients with type 2 diabetes, patients received, in succes- sion, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg Pycnogenol in intervals of 3 weeks.48 Every 3 weeks, fasting and postprandial glucose, endothelin-1, gly- cosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ), and insulin were analyzed. Fasting blood glucose was lowered dose-dependently until a dose of 200 mg Pycnogenol was administered. Increasing the dose from 200 to 300 mg did not further decrease blood glucose. Compared with baseline, to 300 mg of Pycnogenol lowered fasting glucose significantly from 8.64 to 7.54 mmol/L (155–135 mg/dL). The maximum decrease of postprandial glucose was observed with 200 mg of Pycnogenol (0.07 ± 2.69 mmol/dL [180 mg/dL]). HbA 1c levels decreased continuously from 8.02% to 7.37%. Endothelin-1 decreased significantly after to 300 mg Pycnogenol, from 104 to 91 pg/mL. Stimulation of insulin secretion was excluded as a cause for lower glucose levels because insu- lin levels were not affected. These effects were confirmed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 77 patients with type 2 diabetes. After 8 weeks of treatment, the median drop in fasting blood glucose levels in the Pycnogenol group was 1.96 mmol/L (35.28 mg/dL).49 PCOs are particularly useful in addressing the microvascu- lar pathology of diabetes. In one study in patients with severe dia- betic microangiopathy, 30 patients received oral Pycnogenol (50 mg capsules, three times daily, for a total of 150 mg/day for 4 weeks), whereas 30 comparable patients were observed as controls.50 After weeks, microcirculatory and clinical evaluations showed a progressive decrease in skin flux at rest in the foot (indicating an improvement in the level of microangiopathy), a significant decrease in capillary filtra- tion, and a significant improvement in the venoarteriolar response in all treated subjects. There were no visible effects in controls, except a slight reduction in skin flux at rest in the foot. PCOs are also very much indicated in the treatment of diabetic ret- inopathy. Early intervention in diabetic retinopathy led to significant improvements in microcirculation, retinal edema, and visual acuity.51

## Menopause and Postmenopause

PCOs appear clinically indicated in women during and beyond meno- pause because they have been shown to exert benefit in reducing menopausal symptoms and offering significant cardiovascular benefits during and after menopause. Pycnogenol, 100 mg/day, was used as a supplement for 8 weeks by a group of 35 women. A comparable group of 35 women with identical cardiovascular risk factors was included as the control group. Almost all menopausal symptoms, scored by the Menopausal Symptoms Questionnaire 34, improved significantly in the Pycnogenol group. Supplementation with Pycnogenol also decreased the slightly elevated cholesterol and triglycerides after 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Also, the fasting glucose levels were normalized. The borderline increased BP was reduced to normal values at 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Plasma free radicals dropped significantly by 22%. Homocysteine and CRP lev- els decreased sharply by 43% and 60%, respectively. No significant changes in these risk factors were noted in the control group.52 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 170 perimeno- pausal women were enrolled and treated with 30 mg Pycnogenol or placebo twice daily over a period of 3 months. Menopausal symptoms were evaluated by the Women’s Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and by the Kupperman index, accompanied by an inves- tigation of sex hormones and routine blood chemistry. A sig- nificant placebo effect was apparent in this study, suggesting an improvement of a majority of the WHQ categories. Compared with baseline, Pycnogenol significantly (P < 0.05) improved all symptoms with the exception of formication sensation and abnor- mal perceptions. Pycnogenol was found to be especially effective in improving vasomotor and insomnia/sleep problem symptoms, which were significantly better after 4 and 12 weeks than with pla- cebo. The total Kupperman’s index for perimenopausal symptom severity score decreased significantly by 56% compared with pla- cebo (–39%) after 12 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05). The symptom score was also significantly better after only 4 weeks of treatment with Pycnogenol compared with placebo.53 In another double-blind study, 96 menopausal women aged 40 to 60 years were randomized to receive grape seed extract tablets con- taining either low-dose (100 mg/d) or high-dose (200 mg/d) PCOs, or placebo, for 8 weeks. The following significant changes were observed during the course of the study: (1) physical symptom score, hot flash score, and (2) Athens Insomnia Scale score decreased in the high-dose group after 8 weeks of treatment; (3) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety score and (4) systolic and diastolic BP decreased in the low-dose and high-dose groups after 4 weeks; and lastly, (5) muscle mass increased in the low-dose and high-dose groups after 8 weeks of treatment.54

## Attention Deficit Disorder

Increased oxidative damage is believed to be a central factor in atten- tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), indicating a possible appli- cation for PCO therapy. To date, four studies have been conducted in this patient population. In one study, children with ADHD supple- mentation with PCO (1 mg/kg body weight per day) had an improved ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione (an indication of improved antioxidant status).55 A second study confirmed this effect and also showed a reduced urinary catecholamine concentration, lead- ing to less hyperactivity.56 Another study showed that PCOs reduced the level of oxidized purines represented by 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine in the urine and also increased total antioxidant status.57 Finally, children with ADHD supplemented with 1 mg/kg per day Pycnogenol or placebo over 4 weeks showed that 1 month of Pycnogenol admin- istration caused a significant reduction in hyperactivity, improved attention and visual-motoric coordination, and improved the con- centration of children with ADHD.58 No positive effects were found in the placebo group. Standard questionnaires, the Child Attention Problems teacher rating scale, Conner’s Teacher Rating Scale, the Conner’s Parent Rating Scale, and a modified Wechsler Intelligence Scale for children were used as assessments. These results point to an option for the use of Pycnogenol as a nutritional adjunct in children with ADHD.

## Mild Cognitive Impairment

Various flavonoids and polyphenols have been shown to exert bene- ficial effects in improving cognitive function. There is some evidence that PCOs also exert these benefits, especially in subjects with oxida- tive stress. In a study with 44 subjects with oxidative stress, the use of Pycnogenol at a dosage of 100 mg/day was associated with a decline in the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQ Code), along with improvements in daily tasks, cognitive function, and oxidative stress.59

## Male Infertility and Erectile Function

Pycnogenol alone60 and in combination with l-arginine61 was shown to be helpful in improving sperm quality and function (see Chapter 180, Male Infertility, for more information). Benefits have also been noted in erectile dysfunction.62

## Osteoarthritis

Two double-blind studies have been conducted assessing the effect of PCOs in OA. In the first study, Pycnogenol (100 mg) or placebo was given daily for 3 months to 156 patients with osteoarthritis.63 The global Western Ontario and McMasters University questionnaire for OA score decreased by 56% in the treatment group versus 9.6% in the placebo group. Walking distance on the treadmill test was prolonged from 68 m at the start of the study to 198 m in the Pycnogenol group compared with 65 to 88 m in the placebo group. The use of drugs decreased by 58% in the Pycnogenol group versus 1% in the placebo group. Foot edema decreased in 79% of Pycnogenol-treated patients versus 1% in controls. Similar results were seen in the second study when Pycnogenol was given at a dosage of 150 mg/day for 3 months.64 A pharmacokinetic study showed that procyanidins distribute into the synovial fluid of patients with OA, which supports ratio- nalizing the results of clinical efficacy studies. Thirty-three patients with severe OA scheduled for a knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive either 200 mg per day Pycnogenol or no treatment over weeks before surgery. Catechin and taxifolin primarily resided within the blood cells, whereas the microbial catechin metabolite δ -(3,4-di- hydroxy-phenyl)- γ -valerolactone, ferulic, and caffeic acid were mainly present in synovial fluid samples. Taxifolin was detected in serum and synovial fluid exclusively in the Pycnogenol group.65

## Periodontal Disease

Given the importance of supporting periodontal collagen structures in periodontal disease, PCOs are an important clinical consideration (see Chapter 199 on periodontal disease for more information).

## Venous Insufficiency and Capillary Fragility

PCOs are very much indicated for the treatment of varicose veins, venous insufficiency, and capillary fragility because of their ability to: • Reduce microvascular edema • Increase the integrity of the venous wall • Inhibit the breakdown of the compounds composing the ground substance • Improve the muscular tone of the vein Numerous double-blind studies with Pycnogenol validated the effectiveness of PCOs in chronic venous insufficiency, including stud- ies showing an ability to decrease venous ulcer size,66–68 reduce the edema and thrombosis associated with airline travel or prolonged sit- ting,69–71 reduce nighttime claudication, and reduce other signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency and microangiopathy.72–74

## Visual Function, Retinopathy, and Macular Degeneration

Increased intake of PCO is likely to benefit almost everyone. This sug- gestion is perhaps best illustrated by research evaluating the effects of grape seed PCO extract on visual function in healthy subjects.75,76 In one of the studies, 100 normal volunteers with no retinal disorder received either 200 mg/day of PCOs or placebo for 5 or 6 weeks. The group receiving PCOs demonstrated significant improvement in visual perfor- mance in dark and after-glare tests compared with the placebo group. PCO extracts were also shown to be of benefit in treating retinopathies, especially diabetic retinopathy. In one study, 40 patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other vascular diseases involving the retina were ran- domly treated with placebo or PCO extract (50 mg three times daily for 2 months). The results demonstrated a beneficial effect of PCOs on the progression of retinopathy. In patients without any treatment (placebo group), the retinopathy progressively worsened during the trial, and the visual acuity significantly decreased. In contrast, the PCO-treated patients showed no deterioration of retinal function, and a significant recovery of visual acuity was also obtained. Fluorangiography showed an improvement of retinal vascularization and reduced endothelial per- meability and leakage in the PCO group but not in the placebo-treated patients. Ophthalmoscopy and electroretinography also confirmed the beneficial effects of PCOs. In addition to the PCOs exerting free-radi- cal-scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and capillary protective activities, it was suggested that PCOs might bind to the blood vessel wall proteins and mucopolysaccharides and produce a capillary “sealing” effect, lead- ing to reductions in capillary permeability and edema formation.77

## Psoriasis

Pycnogenol significantly improved the painful and visible symptoms of psoriasis, including redness, flaking, and the thickness of the total surface area of the affected skin patches.78 Seventy-three patients (age range 30–45) with moderate/severe plaque psoriasis were included in a 12-week study. Patients either received “standard drug management” alone or with Pycnogenol at a dosage of 150 mg/day (50 mg three times daily). Over 12 weeks, the addition of Pycnogenol was shown to: • Significantly decrease the area of skin affected by psoriasis in all body regions (Pycnogenol 20%; standard management [SM] 8%) • Significantly reduce redness (Pycnogenol 44%; SM 28%), skin hardening (Pycnogenol 45%; SM 21%), and flaking (Pycnogenol 45%; SM 16%) of body area affected by psoriasis • Significantly increase the content of water and oil/lipids in all areas of the skin • Significantly reduce the need for standard management drugs • Significantly reduce oxidative stress In addition to the physical results just listed, supplementation with Pycnogenol was shown to significantly decrease the cost of treatment (decreased 36.4% on average in comparison with SM) and reduce the number of side effects reported for other treatments.


As antioxidant support, a daily dose of 50 to 100 mg of either the grape seed or pine bark extract is suitable. When PCO extracts are being used for therapeutic purposes, the daily dosage should be increased to to 300 mg/day.


PCO extracts are without known side effects. In a clinical study with PCOs from grape seed extract, 29 subjects daily received oral dosages of 1000, 1500, or 2500 mg daily for 4 weeks. At this level, PCOs were found to be generally safe and well tolerated in humans. Research with a larger number of subjects is required to confirm these findings.79


There are no documented drug interactions for the procyanidins.

declared an endangered species. Alternatives to wild collection to meet future market demand include conservation practices, enrichment plantings, and small- and large-scale production. Currently, the species is at the beginning of a transition from an exclusively wild-collected species to that of a cultivated medicinal tree.5


Pharmacological screening of various extracts prepared with solvents of differing degrees of polarity indicated that the highest activity was found in lipophilic extracts.1 This finding is interesting in light of pygeum’s historical administration in lipophilic media (palm oil or milk). Virtually all of the pharmacological research featured a pygeum extract standardized to contain 14% triterpenes, including β -sitosterol and 0.5% n-docosanol. This extract was extensively studied in both experimental animal studies and clinical trials with humans. The primary target organ for pygeum’s effects in men is the pros- tate. The three major active components of pygeum appear to exert different, yet complementary, effects in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In addition, pygeum was shown to enhance the secretions of the prostate and bulbourethral glands, in terms of both quantity and quality.

## Ferulic Acid Esters

The esters of ferulic acid act primarily on the endocrine system. Studies in animals showed docosanol reduced levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone while raising adrenal steroid secretion of both adrenal androgens and corticosteroids.6,7 Docosanol also sig- nificantly lowers serum prolactin levels. This reduction of prolactin is quite significant because prolactin increases both the uptake of testos- terone and the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone within the prostate. The accumulation of testosterone within the prostate and its subse- quent conversion to the more potent dihydrotestosterone is thought to be the major contributing factor to the hyperplasia of the prostatic cells observed in BPH.8 Although traces of docosanol are present in pygeum, the esterification with ferulic acid results in greater bioavail- ability and activity.2,4,9 Ferulic acid esters and the sterol fraction of pygeum exert cho- lesterol-lowering action systemically as well as within the prostate.9 Breakdown products of cholesterol were shown to accumulate in prostate tissue affected with either BPH or cancer.8 These metabo- lites of cholesterol initiate degeneration of prostatic cells, which can promote prostatic enlargement. Drugs that lower cholesterol levels were shown to have a favorable influence on BPH, preventing the accumulation of cholesterol in prostatic cells and limiting subsequent formation of damaging cholesterol metabolites. The lowering of intraprostatic cholesterol content is an important aspect of the phar- macology of pygeum. The sterolic fraction is also endowed with competitive action against testosterone accumulation within the prostate. In addition, the sterols of pygeum were also shown to reduce inflammation by prevent- ing the intraprostatic formation of inflammatory prostaglandins.9,10

## Other Components

Other components of pygeum are also important. For example, the pentacyclic triterpenes exhibit anti-inflammatory effects within the prostatic epithelium and may be responsible for stimulation of the secretory cells of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and bulbourethral glands.9–11 Finally, the fatty acid components are similar to those of Serenoa repens (see Chapter 122) and may exert similar effects and also improve the oral bioavailability of other components of the lipophilic extract.

## Prostate Disorders

The pharmacological actions of the standardized pygeum extract sup- port its use in prostate disorders, BPH in particular. Adding further support are the results of numerous clinical trials in more than patients.12–34 These studies consistently demonstrated that pygeum effectively reduces the symptoms and clinical signs of BPH, especially in early cases. However, it must be pointed out that improvement is largely symptomatic because the reductions in the size of the prostate and in residual urine content of the bladder are modest. The results of the clinical trials on pygeum are given in Table 107.1. A discussion of some of the most important aspects of these studies follows. One of the major findings in evaluating the effectiveness of pygeum in BPH was the high rate of response to placebo. This was well demon- strated in one of the larger double-blind studies.30 As in other dou- ble-blind studies, pygeum extract was shown to be statistically superior to placebo in reducing the major symptoms of BPH (nocturnal fre- quency, difficulty in starting micturition, and incomplete emptying of the bladder). However, there was a high percentage of responses to the placebo (Table 107.2). It seems that simply taking a capsule provides relief to many sufferers. Another study highlighted the importance of double-blind studies that featured both objective and subjective findings. In the study, both patients and physicians rated the placebo and pygeum extract to be effective in improving subjective symptoms, which were daytime fre- quency, nocturia, weak stream, after-dribbling, hesitation, and inter- ruption of flow.29 However, urodynamic variables (flow, frequency, and histogram) clearly demonstrated the superiority of pygeum over placebo. One of the shortcomings of some of the clinical research on pygeum in BPH was the lack, in many of the studies, of objective mea- sures, such as urine flow rate (milliliters per second), residual urine content, and prostate size. Studies that used objective measurements showed some good results. For example, in one open trial, 30 patients with BPH who were given 100 mg/day of the pygeum extract for days demonstrated significant improvements in objective parameters: maximum urine flow rate increased from 5.43 to 8.20 mL/s, and the residual urine volume dropped from 76 to 33 mL.23 Pygeum may emerge as a significant protector against prostate cancer (PCa) because pygeum extract and its components (e.g., atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide) inhibit the transac- tivation mediated by the ligand-activated human androgen recep- tor (AR). Inhibition of human AR by androgen ablation therapy and synthetic antiandrogens is the primary goal in the treatment of PCa. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed pygeum compo- nents inhibited the nuclear transport of AR and endogenous pros- tate-specific antigen expression and efficiently repressed the growth of both the androgen-dependent and some types of androgen- independent prostate cancer cells.35–38 Currently used synthetic AR antagonists bind to the AR and induce a conformational change that leads to the dissociation of key proteins in the AR, but the antagonist-bound AR is still translocated to the nucleus, where it recruits corepressors to block its transcriptional activity. Pygeum components act a little differently, in that they selectively bind to the AR and inhibit the translocation to the nucleus, and in conse- quence, it functions as an androgen-activated transcription factor. This difference in mechanism may overcome a major shortcoming with antihormone therapy in PCa. Typically, antihormone treat- ment is effective only for a limited period of about 16 to 24 months, after which PCa becomes androgen independent. Different mecha- nisms seem to be involved in this process, but AR mutations during

PCa progression render therapeutically used antiandrogens into AR agonists. In consequence, those therapeutics then become use- less, and even counterproductive, because they can promote PCa progression. One of the most interesting studies with pygeum was an investiga- tion on its effect on prostate cell growth in vitro using human serum collected before and after pygeum extract intake at a dosage of at mg twice per day for 5 days. The in vitro analysis consisted of primary and organotypic cultures of human prostatic stromal myofibroblast cell line WPMY and prostatic epithelial cell line PNT2 along with fresh benign prostatic tissue. Results showed that the serum of a treated man induced decreases in the proliferation of primary cells, organotypic cells and WPMY cells but not PNT2 cells. Researchers also analyzed the effect of treated serum on the gene expression profile of WPMY cells. The transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of genes involved in multiple tumor-suppression pathways and a downregula- tion of genes involved in inflammation and oxidative-stress pathways. Hence, the oral intake of pygeum extract resulted in serum levels of active substances that were sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of cul- tured prostatic cells. This inhibition was associated with changes in the transcriptome.39

## Male Infertility and Impotence

Pygeum may be effective in improving fertility when diminished pros- tatic secretion plays a significant role in the problem. Pygeum was shown to increase prostatic secretions and improve the composition of seminal fluid.40–42 Specifically, pygeum administration to men with decreased prostatic secretion led to higher levels of total seminal fluid plus increases in alkaline phosphatase and protein levels. Pygeum appears to be most effective in cases in which the level of alkaline phos- phatase activity is reduced (i.e., less than 400 IU/cm3) and in which there is no evidence of inflammation or infection (i.e., absence of white blood cells and immunoglobulin-A [IgA]). The lack of IgA in the semen is a good predictor of clinical success. In one study, the patients with no IgA in the semen demonstrated an alkaline phosphatase increase from 265 to 485 IU/cm339 In contrast, subjects whose semen contained IgA showed only a modest increase, from 213 to 281 IU/cm3. Pygeum extract also showed an ability to improve the capacity to achieve an erection in patients with BPH or prostatitis, as determined by nocturnal penile tumescence in a double-blind clinical trial.43 BPH and prostatitis are often associated with erectile dysfunction and other sexual disturbances. Presumably by improving the underlying condi- tion, pygeum can improve sexual function.

## Pygeum Versus Serenoa

The standardized liposterolic extract of Serenoa repens is another pop- ular botanical treatment for BPH (see Chapter 122). In a double-blind study that compared pygeum extract with extract of serenoa, the sere- noa extract produced a greater reduction of symptoms and was bet- ter tolerated.44 In addition, the improvement of objective parameters, especially urine flow rate and residual urine content, was better in the clinical studies of serenoa. However, there may be circumstances in which pygeum is more effective than serenoa. For example, sere- noa has not been shown to have the effects on prostate secretion that pygeum has, and the anticancer effects of pygeum may be more signif- icant. Although the two extracts have somewhat overlapping mecha- nisms of actions, they can be used in combination.


The dosage of the lipophilic extract of P. africanum standardized to contain 14% triterpenes, including β -sitosterol and 0.5% n-docosanol, is 100 to 200 mg/day. Typically, the dosage has been divided for twice- a-day administration; however, results were similar in a double-blind study with 100 mg given once a day and 50 mg twice a day, indicating that taking pygeum once a day is equivalent to using divided doses.45 The crude herb is not used.


Tests for acute and long-term toxicity in the rat and mouse showed that the standardized extract of P. africanum bark is nontoxic. Raising the dosage from 1 to 6 g/kg in the mouse and from 1 to 8 g/kg in the rat caused no deaths within 48 hours. In long-term toxicity studies, giving the animals from 60 to 600 mg/kg for 11 months did not produce any negative effects. Pygeum extract also demonstrated no significant toxicity in human clinical trials. The most common side effect is gastrointestinal irrita- tion, resulting in symptoms ranging from nausea to severe stomach pains; however, the presence of these side effects rarely leads to discon- tinuation of therapy.


There are no documented drug interactions for P. africanum.

and neurological disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease), and several chronic degenerative diseases. Current research has pri- marily focused on its ability to protect memory and cognition in both aging animals and humans. In animal studies, PQQ was found to have the following benefits: • Reverses cognitive impairment caused by chronic oxidative stress and improves performance on memory tests in animal models1,2,10 • Stimulates the production and release of nerve growth factor1,2,11 • Protects against the self-oxidation of the DJ-1 gene, an early step in the onset of Parkinson’s disease1,12 • Protects brain cells against oxidative damage in models of strokes1,2,13 • Blocks the formation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a major source of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that are so damag- ing to brain cells1,2,14 • Protects against the likelihood of severe stroke in an experimental animal model for stroke1,2,15 • Protects the brain against neurotoxicity induced by other powerful toxins, including mercury, glutamate, and oxidopamine (a potent neurotoxin used by scientists to induce parkinsonism in laboratory animals)1,2,16,17 • Prevents development of alpha-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson’s disease1,2,18 • Protects nerve cells from the damaging effects of the beta-amy- loid-protein linked with Alzheimer’s disease1,2,19 • Lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, presumably by activating AMP-kinase (AMPk).2,19


PQQ activates AMPk, an enzyme that is found inside living cells and serves as a “master regulating switch” in energy metabolism. Low levels of AMPk activity are associated with the following: • Accelerated aging • Chronic inflammation • High blood cholesterol and triglycerides • Increased visceral “belly” fat • Insulin resistance • Mitochondrial insufficiency and dysfunction • Neurodegeneration • Obesity • Poor blood sugar control Because PQQ increases mitochondrial function and activates AMPk, researchers believe that clinical data will soon produce evi- dence showing that PQQ is helpful for a long list of health challenges.1,2 The ability to enhance mitochondrial energy production is sup- ported by numerous animal studies.1,2,7,21 In humans, PQQ was administered as a single agent in 10 subjects (5 females, 5 males) between the ages of 21 and 34 years. The subjects were given PQQ (BioPQQ, a form of PQQ produced through a natural fermentation process) in a single dose (0.2 mg PQQ/kg), after which multiple mea- surements of plasma and urine PQQ levels and changes in antioxidant potential were examined over a 48-hour period.21 Results indicated a significant increase in antioxidant potential even after one dosage. The same subjects were also given a daily dose of 0.3 mg PQQ/kg and had their blood measured for markers of inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin [IL]-6 levels) and urinary metabolites related to energy metabolism before PQQ administration and 72 hours later. PQQ supplementation resulted in significant decreases in the levels of the inflammatory markers of plasma C-reactive protein and IL-6. Furthermore, the changes in urinary metabolites were consistent with enhanced mitochondria-related functions. The data are among the first to link the systemic effects of PQQ in animals to corresponding effects in humans.21 In a study with BioPQQ test subjects with an initial level of LDL cholesterol greater than 140 mg/dL, 6 weeks of PQQ supplementation produced a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol (from an average of 247–216 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (from an average of 156–132 mg/dL).22 Results persisted at 12 weeks and are believed to be caused by PQQ activating AMPk.

## Insulin Resistance

PQQ holds great promise in the treatment of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and as an antiobesity agent. There are several additional mechanisms of action that support these clinical applications. It is now well established that type 2 diabetes can be characterized as a mito- chondrial disorder.23 It is also well established that the mitochondrial dysfunction of diabetic subjects is closely related to the degree of hyperglycemia, diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, and other lifestyle factors.24 As described previously, PQQ supplementation has been revealed to enhance mitochondrial function and biogenesis. PQQ deficiency increased the plasma glucose level, reduced hepatic mitochondrial content by 20% to 30%, and elevated plasma lipid lev- els, whereas PQQ supplementation reversed mitochondrial alterations and metabolic impairment and significantly improved the lipid pro- file in diabetic rats.20 The mechanisms responsible for the increased mitochondrial biogenesis and function by PQQ are stimulated by the transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated recep- tor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 α ), through activation of the nuclear respiratory factor (NRF-1 and NRF-2). cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) increases transcription of PGC-1 α via a conserved CREB-binding site in the proximal promoter and is activated by exercise or fasting. PQQ elevates PGC-1 α promoter activ- ity by the same mechanism. PQQ exposure also increases the levels of NRF-1 and NRF-2, resulting in the upregulation of the mitochondrial transcription factor A and mitochondrial gene expression.25 PQQ exerts additional mechanisms on insulin signaling and enhances glucose uptake through the translocation of glucose trans- porters. Therefore PQQ can be useful in insulin resistance and type diabetes.2

## Enhancing Cognitive Function

The positive effects of PQQ on the learning and memory function have been demonstrated in animal models.1,2 Although PQQ was effective on its own in some of these studies, when combined with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), better results were observed. This synergistic effect was further demonstrated in a human double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in Japan in 2007.26 In this study of 71 mid- dle-aged and elderly people aged between 40 and 70, supplementation with 20 mg per day of PQQ (as BioPQQ) resulted in improvements on tests of higher cognitive function using the Stroop test compared with the placebo group. However, in the group receiving 20 mg of PQQ along with 300 mg of CoQ10, the results were even more dramatic. PQQ and CoQ10 are both involved in mitochondrial energy produc- tion, which may explain the enhanced results. Another double-blind study used the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS) in 65 subjects between 50 and 70 years old who presented with self-identified for- getfulness or forgetfulness identified by a family member, colleague, or acquaintance.27 The neuropsychological battery questions allow repeated and quick evaluation of disorders in higher-brain function with a variety of brain disease complications. The RBANS consists of five subtests of neurocognitive test paradigms: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, and delayed memory.

## 835CHAPTER 108 Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)

The three arms of the study were PQQ (20 mg/day), PQQ (20 mg/day) + CoQ10 (300 mg/day), and placebo. All three groups showed signifi- cantly better total score over time, but the improvement in immediate memory scores at week 8 were significantly better in the PQQ + CoQ10 group than in the placebo group. For analysis of immediate memory, subjects were stratified into two subgroups according to baseline total scores. Although no significant difference was present between groups in the high-scoring subgroup, the PQQ + CoQ10 group in the low-scor- ing subgroup showed a significantly better score at week 8 and week than the placebo group. This finding shows that individuals with lower RBANS scores may achieve a better degree of improvement in response to PQQ + CoQ10 supplementation than individuals with higher scores. For patients under 50 years of age, however, there may not be a need for simultaneous use of PQQ and CoQ10 unless the person is taking drugs, such as cholesterol-lowering statins, that interfere with CoQ10 manufacture. Double-blind studies in elderly subjects with PQQ alone show less impressive results than studies when PQQ is combined with CoQ10. In one of these studies, 41 healthy elderly subjects were admin- istered 20 mg of PQQ per day or a placebo for 12 weeks. No significant improvements were noted in the Stroop test or reverse Stroop test, but improvements with PQQ were noted in the assessment of visual-spa- tial cognitive function via tablet computer.28 In another trial relating to cognitive function, 17 healthy mid- dle-aged and elderly subjects ingested 20 mg of PQQ Na2 daily for weeks.29 The results in the Profile of Mood States–Short Form showed that all six measures of vigor, fatigue, tension/anxiety, depression, anger/hostility, and confusion significantly improved after PQQ sup- plementation compared with baseline scores. Improvements were also noted for drowsiness at awakening, sleep onset and maintenance, and sleep duration. These improvements correlated with changes in the cortisol awakening response. PQQ also enhances cerebral blood flow and oxygen utilization in the prefrontal cortex. In a study of 20 healthy subjects between 50 and 70 years of age, subjects were administered 20 mg of PQQ (as BioPQQ) or placebo orally once daily for 12 weeks.30 Using transcranial near- infrared stimulation (tNIRS), PQQ was shown to increase hemoglobin concentration and reduce absolute tissue oxygen saturation in the right prefrontal cortex, resulting in enhanced cognitive function.


Although the nutritional requirement for PQQ is likely less than mcg daily, a measured response in mitochondrial function may require increased amounts. The current dosage recommendation of 10 to mg of PQQ daily in humans is based on the equivalent dose in animals that has consistently improved various mitochondrial functions. There are also some clinical and observational studies that justify the dosage.


There are no known side effects or toxicity with PQQ at recommended levels. In a double-blind safety study, human volunteers were given PQQ at a dosage of either 20 or 60 mg/day, or a placebo, for 4 weeks.2 No adverse effects were observed in any group. The urinary concen- tration of N-acetyl- β -d-glucosaminidase (NAG) was also determined in the study. NAG is a sensitive biomarker for renal tubular damage. Levels did not change in any group. Toxicology studies in animals show an excellent safety profile, with the LD 50 being 1000 to 2000 mg PQQ/kg body weight in male and to 1000 mg PQQ/kg body weight in female rats. The no-observed- adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in rats is at a dosage of 400 mg PQQ/kg body weight.31 PQQ exerts no genotoxicity as well.32


There are no known drug interactions with PQQ at recommended levels.

## 837CHAPTER 109 Ruscus aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom)

# HISTORY AND FOLK USE

In ancient Greece, butcher’s broom was used as a laxative and to treat kidney stones.7 In Europe, a wine decoction of the root was used as a diuretic to treat urinary obstructions, kidney stones, and gravel. It was also used to regulate menses, ameliorate jaundice, and treat headaches. In South America, the roasted root was made into a beverage for pros- tate tumors.8

## Anticancer Effect

Butcher’s broom saponins have a cytostatic effect on leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro.9

<!-- chunk -->

## Antielastase Effect

Ruscinogens isolated from butcher’s broom have a remarkable anti- elastase effect in vitro.10

<!-- chunk -->

## Antihypoxic Effect

Hypoxia-induced activation of endothelial cells may be a cause of venous disease. A proprietary extract of butcher’s broom known as Cyclo 3 Fort dose-dependently protected human endothelial cells from induced hypoxia in vitro.10

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-inflammatory Effect

Butcher’s broom extract and its isolated steroidal saponins were anti- inflammatory in several animal models.11 Injected intravenously, it inhibits the permeability-increasing effects of bradykinin, leukotriene B4, and histamine in hamster cheek pouch preparations.12

<!-- chunk -->

## Antimicrobial Effect

Butcher’s broom showed a very low activity against Candida albicans.13

# FIBRINOLYTIC EFFECT

Thrombosis in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is associated with reduced levels of tissue plasminogen activator in varicose veins. In a small study, 20 patients scheduled for vein stripping surgery took butcher’s broom (150 mg) and methyl hesperidin chalcone (150 mg) or a placebo three times daily for 14 days before surgery.14 Segments of the great saphenous vein removed from patients in the active group had enhanced levels of tissue plasminogen activator and enhanced fibrinolytic activity compared with the placebo.

## Lymphatic Flow Effect

Butcher’s broom dose-dependently enhanced the duration and flow intensity of the lymphatic vessels in dogs.15 This effect did not change when the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine was injected, indi- cating that butcher’s broom’s lymphatic effect does not involve the opening of calcium channels but appears to act directly on peripheral lymphatics.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vasoconstrictive Effect

Topical administration of butcher’s broom extract in a hamster cheek preparation dose-dependently inhibited histamine-induced increases in permeability.16 Research suggested that butcher’s broom’s vaso- constrictive effect is mediated by calcium and α -1 adrenergic recep- tors. Heat increases, and cold decreases, butcher’s broom’s ability to increase the release of norepinephrine from the adrenoreceptors.17


There are few clinical studies on the effect of butcher’s broom alone. Instead, most of the clinical studies investigated a proprietary combi- nation formula known as Cyclo 3 Fort by Pierre Fabre Medicament of Paris, France, or Phlebodril by Pierre Fabre Pharma GmbH of Freiburg, Germany. These formulas combine butcher’s broom with trimethylhesperidin chalcone (a flavonoid precursor) and ascorbic acid. Butcher’s broom has action independent of the other compounds in the formula, and some studies indicated that butcher’s broom used alone may have a stronger effect. However, other studies indicated that the combination may have a synergistic effect. All discussions of butch- er’s broom trials in the following content therefore include the possi- bility that it was not butcher’s broom by itself that was active. Butcher’s broom is also paired with Melilotus spp. (sweet clover) in some topical preparations. There are no studies indicating whether butcher’s broom alone would achieve the same results.

## Chronic Venous Insufficiency

Butcher’s broom is most commonly used to alleviate the symptoms of CVI, including ankle edema, itching, tension, and cramping of the legs. Both animal and clinical studies support its effectiveness in CVI, and the German Commission E approved butcher’s broom as an adjunct treatment for this condition.1 A meta-analysis evaluated placebo-controlled, double-blind studies and 5 randomized trials against a comparator drug along with 6 single-arm studies without a placebo. The review included information on 10,246 subjects. Although data quality varied, Cyclo 3 Fort significantly reduced CVI symptoms com- pared with placebos.17 Ten of these studies are summarized in Table 109.1.18–26 All but two were randomized, double-blind trials.

trial, 81.6% of treating physicians rated its efficacy as excellent, and the remaining physicians rated it as good.22 Butcher’s broom acts most strongly when circulation is impaired, but some researchers caution that it is less effective when the disease has compromised the activity of venous wall receptors.20 Finally, a meta-analysis of ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of butcher’s broom extracts concluded that high-quality evidence exists showing that these extracts are very effective in reducing symptoms and edema in patients with CVI.

## Edema and Varicosities

Butcher’s broom shows promise as a treatment for a wide variety of edemas and circulatory disturbances of the venous system. The results of these clinical trials are summarized in Table 109.2.28–37 These trials were also on combination extracts with butcher’s broom as a major component. Many of the studies are small, and some are poorly designed, but the overall picture supports the abil- ity of butcher’s broom to reduce the swelling and discomfort asso- ciated with primary and secondary edema. It has positive effects in pregnancy-related venous insufficiency, varicosities, lymphedema, symptoms of swelling of ankles and breast tenderness in premen- strual syndrome (PMS), edema secondary to calcium channel antagonist therapy for hypertension, and swelling secondary to soft tissue injury.

## Hemorrhoids

The German Commission E approved butcher’s broom as a treatment for hemorrhoids.1 In an open-label multicenter study of 124 patients with hemorrhoids, 69% of patients and 75% of the treating physicians rated the butcher’s broom combination extract Cyclo 3 Fort as having good or excellent efficacy.38 Ninety-two percent of physicians rated the treatment as safe and well tolerated. Significant positive effects were observed after 7 days of treatment. Although controlled trials are war- ranted, butcher’s broom may be a useful treatment for patients with hemorrhoids.

## Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy can abruptly cause severe deterioration of vision, and it is estimated that the incidence of retinopathy may be as high as 80% in patients with long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes. In a study of 60 patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes, butcher’s broom compared favorably with troxerutin.39 Butcher’s broom pro- duced a 23% regression of negative changes in the fundus of the eye, with no sign of progression. Troxerutin produced a somewhat larger regression (27.8%) but also had a greater (5.8%) progression rate. Butcher’s broom also decreased blood glucose and cholesterol levels and significantly increased high-density lipoproteins in this prelimi- nary study.

## Premenstrual Syndrome

Butcher’s broom significantly reduced symptoms of breast ten- derness in women with diagnosed PMS in a randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind study of 40 women with PMS of an average duration of 67 months.34 The amount of butcher’s broom admin- istered for 90 days was not stated. Eighty percent of the women in the active group reported a complete resolution of PMS symptoms of mastalgia and breast tension. Unexpectedly, butcher’s broom also had a dramatic effect on some of the psychological symptoms associated with PMS (e.g., complete resolution in 85% of the sub- jects of symptoms such as irritableness, “hair-trigger temper,” and “temporary alienation”). In vitro research indicated that butcher’s broom acts more efficiently in the presence of progesterone; butch- er’s broom may be most effective during the luteal phase of a wom- an’s menstrual cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

## Soft Tissue Injuries

In a small study, butcher’s broom applied topically reduced the swell- ing and pain caused by soft tissue sports injuries.27 Several in vitro studies showed that butcher’s broom’s action is enhanced by heat, suggesting that it may be advantageous to apply heat to the site of the injury when using the herb.


The dosage of butcher’s broom for therapeutic use should be based on the ruscogenin content in the range of 16.5 to 33 mg of ruscogenins two to three times daily. Standardized extracts are preferred for therapeutic use because they allow for more accurate dosages. Recommendations for other forms of butcher’s broom are as follows: Dried rootstalk in capsules, tablets or tea: 500 to 1000 mg three times a day Tincture (1:5): 2 to 4 mL three times a day Fluid extract (1:1): 1 to 2 mL three times a day


Butcher’s broom is generally considered very safe. It occasionally causes gastrointestinal distress, and in rare instances, it causes lymphatic coli- tis.1,40,41 Thus butcher’s broom should probably not be combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other drugs linked with lym- phatic colitis, and use should be discontinued if negative gastrointes- tinal symptoms are severe or persist.40 One author cautioned against the use of butcher’s broom in pregnancy based on a lack of proof of safety.3 Although not definitive, preliminary animal and clinical stud- ies cited previously indicated that butcher’s broom does not have neg- ative effects when used during pregnancy. Once case report claims that a butcher’s broom extract combined with metformin precipitated dia- betic ketoacidosis in a 39-year-old woman with a history of poor blood sugar control, although various other complications in her health pic- ture (e.g., recent vomiting and diarrhea) could have been a factor.42


In an in vitro study, adenosine, cocaine, phentolamine, prazosin, and verapamil reduced butcher’s broom’s vasoconstrictive effect.43 Acetylcholine and rauwolscine potentiated its vasoconstrictive action. No clinical studies have been conducted to determine whether butch- er’s broom interferes with or affects the action of the aforementioned, or any other, drugs.

example, a small, 8-week double-blind study in patients with chronic schizophrenia given either SAMe 800 mg or placebo found improve- ment of depressive symptoms only in females.9 Although most of the early studies used injectable SAMe, most recent studies have used an oral dose of 400 mg four times daily (1600 mg total) and have demonstrated that SAMe is just as effective given orally as when it is given intravenously.4,10-15 That is not surprising, because there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of SAMe 1000 mg administered orally or intravenously.16 Several studies have compared SAMe with tricyclic antidepressants. Before the rise of SSRIs, tricyclics were the mainstay pharmaceutical treat- ment for depression. A 2002 review concluded that, “at doses of 200 to mg/day, SAMe is superior to placebo and is as effective as tricyclic antide- pressants in alleviating depression, although some individuals may require higher doses.”10 The reviewers found six of eight placebo-controlled stud- ies, featuring anywhere from 40 to 100 participants, demonstrating that SAMe was superior to placebo; moreover, six of eight comparison studies showed that SAMe was just as effective as tricyclic antidepressants. These studies have shown that SAMe is better tolerated than the tricyclics and has a quicker onset of antidepressant action.11 In one study comparing SAMe with desipramine, in addition to determining the clinical response, the blood level of SAMe was deter- mined in both groups. At the end of the 4-week trial, 62% of the patients treated with SAMe and 50% of those treated with desipra- mine had significantly improved. Regardless of the type of treatment, patients with a 50% decrease in scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale showed a significant rise in plasma SAMe concentration. These results suggest that one of the ways in which tricyclic antidepressant agents exert their antidepressant effects is by raising SAMe levels.17 In two separate double-blind studies, SAMe was given orally (1600 mg daily) or intramuscularly (400 mg daily) and compared with mg of imipramine given orally daily. In both studies, the results of SAMe and imipramine treatment did not differ significantly for any efficacy measure. However, significantly fewer adverse events were observed in the patients treated with SAMe. The researchers concluded that the antidepressant efficacy of 1600 mg SAMe orally and 400 mg SAMe intramuscularly is comparable with that of 150 mg of imipra- mine but that SAMe is significantly better tolerated.18 Several studies have compared SAMe with SSRIs. In one double- blind study, 144 subjects with major depressive disorder were given SAMe (1600–3200 mg/daily), escitalopram (10–20 mg/daily), or matching placebo for 12 weeks.19 Using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), SAMe showed a moderate to large effect size from baseline to the end of 12 weeks. Response rates (HAMD-17 ≥ 50% reduction) at endpoint were 45%, 31%, and 26% for SAMe, escitalo- pram, and placebo, respectively; whereas remission rates (HAM-D ≤ 7) were 34% for SAMe, 23% for escitalopram, and 6% for placebo. A similar study did not show nearly the same advantage, as neither SAMe nor escitalopram showed a better effect than a placebo.20 SAMe can be used safely with SSRIs and may have a synergistic effect. In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial lasting 6 weeks, depressed patients who were unresponsive to SSRI medications alone were given 800 mg of SAMe or placebo twice daily along with their SSRIs.21 The response and remission rates according to the Hamilton Depression Scale were higher for patients treated with adjunctive SAMe (36.1% and 25.8%, respectively) than adjunctive placebo (17.6% vs. 11.7%, respectively). These results indicate that SAMe can be used safely with SSRIs and may have a synergistic effect. In a study on 20 HIV-seropositive individuals with depression, SAMe as a sole antidepressant medication showed significant effect. There was a significant reduction in acute depressive symptomatology, reaching the defined clinical treatment response threshold of a greater than 50% reduction in symptom scores. The researchers also noted that SAMe had a rapid effect as early as after only 1 week, with progres- sive decreases in symptom scores throughout the study.22 SAMe has also been shown to produce significant effects in other conditions associated with depression, such as during the postpartum period and in drug rehabilitation. SAMe’s benefits in these conditions are probably due to a combination of its effects on brain chemistry and liver function (discussed later). In the study in postpartum depression, the administration of SAMe (1600 mg/day) was associated with signifi- cantly better mood scores compared with placebo.23 In another study, SAMe (1200 mg/day) was shown to significantly reduce psychological distress (chiefly anxiety and depression) in the detoxification and reha- bilitation of opiate abusers.24 SAMe may also be helpful in managing the symptomatology of schizophrenia. In one double-blind study, 18 patients with chronic schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either SAMe (800 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks. Results indicated some reduction in aggressive behavior and improved quality of life after SAMe admin- istration. Female patients showed improvement of depressive symp- toms, whereas male patients showed no change compared with placebo. Blood dopamine levels increased in women but decreased in men receiving SAMe. Clinical improvement did not correlate with serum SAMe levels. Two patients receiving SAMe exhibited some exacerbation of irritability; therefore, it should be used with caution in these patients.9 Detailed clinical evaluations using electroencephalography, event-related potentials, and low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography have clearly indicated a central nervous system antide- pressant action of SAMe.18

## Osteoarthritis

SAMe has also demonstrated impressive results in the treatment of osteoarthritis.25 A deficiency of SAMe in the joint tissue, just like a defi- ciency of glucosamine, leads to loss of the gel-like nature and shock- absorbing qualities of cartilage. As a result, osteoarthritis can develop. In vitro studies have shown that SAMe exerts a number of effects that appear to be highly relevant in the treatment of osteoarthritis.26 First, the agent has been shown to be important in the manufacture of cartilage components. This effect has been demonstrated very well in humans. In one double-blind study conducted in Germany, the patients with osteoarthritis of the hands who were given SAMe showed greater cartilage formation on magnetic resonance imaging.27 These results indicate that SAMe is capable of improving the structure and function of cartilage in joints affected by osteoarthritis. Second, SAMe has shown some mild pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects in animal studies.1 All of these effects combine to produce clinical benefits.

## 843CHAPTER 110 SAMe (S-Adenosylmethionine)

In double-blind trials, SAMe has demonstrated similar reductions in pain scores and clinical symptoms to those produced by nonsteroi- dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, nabumetone, celecoxib, and piroxicam.25 In one double- blind study, SAMe was compared with ibuprofen.28 The 36 subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and/or spine received a daily oral dose of 1200 mg of SAMe or 1200 mg of ibuprofen for 4 weeks. Morning stiffness, pain at rest, pain on motion, crepitation (crackling noise upon movement of a joint), swelling, and limitation of motion of the affected joints were assessed before and after treatment. The total score obtained by evaluating all the individual clinical parame- ters improved to the same extent in patients treated with SAMe and in those treated with ibuprofen. In two other studies, SAMe was actually shown to produce slightly better results.29,30 SAMe has also been compared with naproxen (Naprosyn). In one double-blind study, 20 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were given either SAMe or naproxen for 6 weeks.31 During the first week, SAMe was administered at a dose of 400 mg three times daily and after- ward at a dose of 400 mg twice daily, whereas the dose of naproxen during the first week was 250 mg three times daily and subsequently 250 mg twice daily. During the first 2 weeks, the patients were allowed to take acetaminophen as an additional analgesic if the pain was severe. The patients were examined at the beginning of the study and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The parameters tested were pain, crepitation, joint swell- ing, circumference of joint, extent of motility, and 10-meter walking time. At the end of the sixth week, no statistically significant difference between the two patient groups was found; both groups exhibited a marked improvement on all parameters. Another double-blind study compared SAMe with both naproxen and placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip, knee, spine, and hand. The study involved 33 rheumatologic and orthopedic medical centers and a total of 734 subjects. SAMe administered orally at a dose of 1200 mg daily was shown to exert the same analgesic (pain-relieving) activity as naproxen at a dose of 750 mg daily. However, SAMe was found to be significantly more effective than naproxen, both in terms of physicians’ and patients’ judgments and in terms of the number of patients with side effects. In fact, SAMe was better tolerated than placebo. A total of 10 patients in the SAMe group and 13 in the placebo group withdrew from the study because of intolerance to the intervention.32 Other double-blind studies have shown SAMe to offer pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory benefits similar to those of drugs like indomethacin and piroxicam while also being generally much better tolerated than these potent NSAIDs.33,34 Perhaps the most meaningful study of SAMe in the treatment of osteoarthritis was a long-term multicenter open 2-year trial involving 97 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and spine.35 The patients received 600 mg of SAMe daily for the first 2 weeks and thereafter mg daily until the end of the 24th month of treatment. Separate eval- uations were made for osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, cervical spine, and dorsal-lumbar spine. The severity of the clinical symptoms (morn- ing stiffness, pain at rest, and pain on movement) was assessed with scoring before the start of the treatment, at the end of the first and second weeks of treatment, and then monthly until the end of the 24-month period. SAMe showed good clinical effectiveness and was well tolerated. Improvement in the clinical symptoms during therapy with SAMe was already evident after the first weeks and continued to the end of treatment. Nonspecific side effects occurred in 20 patients, but in no case did therapy have to be discontinued. Most side effects disappeared during the course of therapy. Moreover, during the last months of treatment, no adverse effect was recorded. Detailed labora- tory tests carried out at the start and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment showed no pathological changes. SAMe administration also improved the depressive feelings often associated with osteoarthritis. One study compared the efficacy and tolerability of SAMe (1200 mg/day) and nabumetone (Relafene, 1000 mg/day) in 134 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee for 8 weeks.36 An analysis of changes in pain intensity between weeks 0 and 8 found that both SAMe and nabumetone effectively reduced pain intensity from baseline in each group and that the degree of decrease in pain intensity was not signifi- cantly different between the groups. The patients’ global assessments of disease status, physician’s global assessment of response to ther- apy, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) index scores were not significantly different between the groups. A randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing SAMe (1200 mg) with celecoxib (Celebrex 200 mg) for 16 weeks to reduce pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee in 56 subjects showed that SAMe has a slower onset of action but is as effective as celecoxib in the management of symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.37 Finally, in the largest study, 20,641 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and spine and also with osteoarthritic polyarthritis of the fingers were studied over 8 weeks.38 The patients were given 400 mg of SAMe three times daily for the first week, 400 mg twice daily for the second week, and 200 mg twice daily from the third week onward. No additional analgesic or anti-inflammatory treatment was allowed. The efficacy of SAMe was comparable with results achieved with NSAIDs. Efficacy was described as very good or good in 71% of cases, moderate in 21%, and poor in 9%; tolerance of the agent was assessed as very good or good in 87%, moderate in 8%, and poor in 5%. What all of these studies indicate is that SAMe appears to offer sig- nificant advantages over NSAIDs. The latter drugs are associated with significant risks of toxicity, side effects, and actual promotion of the disease process in osteoarthritis, but SAMe offers similar benefits with- out risks or side effects.

## Fibromyalgia

SAMe has been shown in four double-blind clinical studies to produce excellent benefits in patients suffering from fibromyalgia.39-42 In two of the studies, injectable SAMe (200 mg daily) was used. During treat- ment, subjects demonstrated significant reductions in the number of trigger points and painful areas as well as improvements in mood.39,40 In one of the studies, oral SAMe (800 mg/day) was compared with a placebo for 6 weeks in 44 patients with fibromyalgia.41 Tender-point score, muscle strength, disease activity, subjective symptoms, mood parameters, and side effects were evaluated. Patients given SAMe demonstrated improvements in clinical disease activity, pain experi- enced during the last week, fatigue, morning stiffness, and mood; how- ever, the tender-point score and muscle strength did not differ in the two treatment groups. SAMe was without side effects. In one of the studies, SAMe was compared with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation—a popular treatment for fibromyalgia— in 30 patients with this disorder.43 Patients receiving SAMe (200 mg by injection and 400 mg/day orally) experienced significantly greater clin- ical benefit as shown by a decreased number of tender points, dimin- ished subjective feelings of pain and fatigue, and improved mood. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation offered little benefit for most symptoms, whereas SAMe was deemed “effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of primary fibromyalgia.”42

## Liver Disorders

SAMe has been shown to be beneficial in several liver disorders, including cirrhosis, Gilbert syndrome, and oral contraceptive–induced liver damage. Its benefits are related to its function as the major methyl donor in the liver as well as restoring hepatic glutathione concentra- tions, thereby reducing liver injury. It also possesses lipotropic activity.

## 844SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

One of the leading contributors to impaired liver function is dimin- ished bile flow, or cholestasis. SAMe is beneficial for a variety of liver disorders because of its lipotropic ability to promote bile flow and relieve cholestasis.43,44 Another key function of SAMe in the liver is the inactivation of estrogens. Clinical studies have shown that SAMe is useful in pro- tecting the liver from damage and improving liver function in condi- tions associated with estrogen excess—namely, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and premenstrual syndrome.45-48 SAMe has shown bene- fit in the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a special complication of pregnancy characterized by skin pruritus, abnormal liver function tests, and bile acids. Alhtough helpful, SAMe is not as effective as a monotherapy as ursodeoxycholic acid or the two agents combined.47,48 Another key indication for the use of SAMe is in the treatment of Gilbert syndrome, a common disorder characterized by a chron- ically elevated serum bilirubin level (1.2–3.0 mg/dL) typically due to underactivity of uridine disphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1. Previously considered rare, this disorder is now known to affect as many as 5% of the general population. The condition is usually with- out symptoms, although some patients complain of loss of appetite, malaise, and fatigue (typical symptoms of impaired liver function). Also to be considered is the decreased ability to detoxify environmen- tal toxins normally neutralized by this pathway. SAMe at a dosage of 400 mg three times daily has resulted in a significant decrease in serum bilirubin in patients with Gilbert syndrome.49 In addition to these relatively minor disturbances in liver func- tion, SAMe offers some benefits in the treatment of chronic liver disorders, including cirrhosis.50 Its effect in cirrhosis appears to be due to an ability to overcome the SAMe depletion characterized by the disorder. Because SAMe is involved in so many liver processes, the depletion of levels of SAMe within the liver has serious conse- quences. Supplementation with SAMe in patients with liver cirrhosis not only improves bile flow and clinical signs and symptoms but also promotes membrane function and increases levels of glutathione.51-54 Glutathione assumes a critical role in detoxification as well as in the defense against a variety of injurious agents by combining directly with these toxic substances to eventually form water-soluble compounds. Because many of the toxic compounds are lipid (fat) soluble, conver- sion to water-soluble compounds results in more efficient excretion via the kidneys. When higher levels of toxic compounds are present or liver function is impaired, higher glutathione levels are required. One of the greatest risks of chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis is liver cancer. Supplementation with SAMe appears to be strongly indicated in patients with such diseases in the attempt to reduce the risk of liver cancer. Animal studies have shown a significant protective effect of supplemental SAMe against liver cancer in animals exposed to liver carcinogens.55

## Migraine

SAMe has also been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of migraine headaches. The benefit arises gradually and long-term treatment is required for therapeutic effectiveness.56


In general, the longer SAMe is used, the more beneficial the results. This agent is perfectly suited for long-term use because of its excellent safety profile. Although some studies have used intravenous dosages, there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of SAMe between single- and multiple-dose administration of a stan- dard 1000-mg dose administered orally or intravenously. No evidence of accumulation of SAMe in plasma was found on multiple dosing. The dosage ranges for the various clinical indications are as follows: Depression: 400 to 1600 mg daily. Because SAMe can cause nausea and gastrointestinal disturbances in some people, it is recommended that it be started at a dosage of 200 mg twice daily for the first day, increased to 400 mg twice daily on day 3, and finally raised to the full dosage of 800 mg twice daily after 10 days if needed Osteoarthritis: The dosage is best started out as mentioned previously for depression. After 21 days at a dosage of 1600 mg daily, the main- tenance dosage is reduced to 200 mg twice a day Fibromyalgia: 200 to 400 mg two times a day Liver disorders: 200 to 400 mg two to three times a day Migraine headaches: 200 to 400 mg two times a day


No significant side effects have been reported with oral SAMe other than occasional nausea and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, individuals with bipolar (manic) depression should not take SAMe unless they are under strict medical supervision, because SAMe’s anti- depressant activity may lead to the manic phase in these individuals; this effect is seen only in some people with bipolar depression.

# INTERACTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS

SAMe functions very closely with vitamin B 12 , folic acid, vitamin B 6 , and choline in methylation reactions. Because of SAMe’s effects on the liver, it may enhance the elimination of various drugs from the body.57 The clinical significance of this effect has not been fully determined. It has been cautioned that SAMe should be avoided in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Animal studies indicate that excessive methylation is associated with Parkinson’s disease, and SAMe excess has caused Parkinson’s disease–like effects in animal studies.57 In addition, both animal and human studies indicate that increased methylation can cause the depletion of dopamine and block the effects of l-dopa.53,58,59 This line of research is somewhat contra- dicted, however, by preliminary evidence that SAMe may improve the emotional depression and impaired mental function often asso- ciated with this disorder.60 Nonetheless, it is recommended that patients with Parkinson’s disease avoid supplementing with SAMe until more is known.

several tumor cell lines.7–10 Yet, sarsaparilla’s mechanism of action is largely unknown. Clinically, it has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis.1,11,12 This evidence points to a possible effect on the binding of cholesterol and bacterial toxins in the intestines. Sarsaparilla has also demonstrated hepatoprotective effects13 and an ability to protect against lead-induced oxidative stress in an animal model.14

<!-- chunk -->

## Endotoxin Binding

Evidence seems to support sarsaparilla as an endotoxin binder. Endotoxins are cell wall constituents of bacteria absorbed from the gut. Normally, the liver plays a vital role by filtering these and other gut-derived compounds before they reach the general circulation. If the amount of endotoxin absorbed is excessive or the liver is not func- tioning adequately, it can become overwhelmed, and endotoxins then spill into the blood. If endotoxins are allowed to circulate, activation of the alter- nate complement system occurs. This system plays a critical role in aggravating inflammatory processes, and activation of complement is responsible for much of the inflammation and cell damage seen in many diseases, including gout, arthritis, and psoriasis. Historically, these conditions have been treated with sarsaparilla. In further support of sarsaparilla’s effect as a binder of endotoxin is its historic use in the treatment of fever, because absorbed endo- toxins produce fever. Sarsaparilla also exhibits some immune enhanc- ing activity. Smilax glabra root contains a heteropolysaccharide that promotes phagocytosis and increased macrophage-derived biological factors including nitric oxide, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor- α , and interleukin-1 β . This activation of macrophages enhances systemic host immune system function.1

# CLINICAL APPLICATION

Sarsaparilla’s medicinal action appears to be a result of its binding of bacterial endotoxins in the gut, which makes them unabsorbable. This action greatly reduces the stress on the liver and other organs and is probably responsible for sarsaparilla’s historic use as a tonic and blood purifier. The ability to bind endotoxins is also probably the reason that sarsaparilla is effective in many cases of psoriasis, gout, and arthritis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Psoriasis

Individuals with psoriasis have been shown to have high levels of cir- culating endotoxins. Binding of endotoxin in the gut is associated with clinical improvement in these individuals. In a controlled study of patients, an endotoxin-binding saponin (sarsaponin) from sarsaparilla greatly improved the psoriasis in 62% of the patients and resulted in complete clearance in 18%.12


• Dried root: 1 to 4 g or by decoction three times a day • Liquid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL three times a day • Solid extract (4:1): 250 to 500 mg three times a day


Although no adverse effects have been reported for sarsaparilla, it is possible that problems can arise if large doses are used over a long time.


No drug interactions have been reported for sarsaparilla. However, it has been theorized that sarsaparilla may increase the absorption of cer- tain drugs, notably digitalis and bismuth, thereby potentially increas- ing the chance of drug toxicity.

## 848SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


A standardized liposterolic (fat-soluble), saw palmetto drupe extract has demonstrated numerous pharmacological effects relating to its pri- mary clinical application in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperpla- sia (BPH), a common disorder of the prostate gland (Fig. 112.3). Saw palmetto extract affects BPH through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of the intraprostatic conversion of testosterone to DHT and of its intracellular binding and transport, antiestrogenic, and receptor site–binding effects.5–7 Estrogen may contribute to BPH because it inhibits the hydroxyl- ation and subsequent elimination of DHT among other mechanisms. Serenoa inhibits the activity of estrogen in the prostate. In one dou- ble-blind study, 35 men with BPH were randomized to saw palmetto extract 160 mg twice daily or placebo for 90 days.5 Men receiving the saw palmetto extract had significantly lower cytosol and receptor val- ues for estrogen and progesterone than the placebo group. The results imply that at least part of the efficacy of the saw palmetto extract is because of its antiestrogenic effect. There was no change in the number of cytosol androgen receptors, but the number of nuclear androgen receptors was significantly lower in the saw palmetto group (60% of the placebo group tested positive for the nuclear receptor compared with 10% of the saw palmetto group). These results indicate that the saw palmetto extract probably competitively blocks the translocation of the cytosol androgen recep- tor to the nucleus. Preliminary analysis of the extract demonstrates that separate frac- tions are responsible for the antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects. Researchers in this study said, “It cannot be excluded, however, that the primary effect is antiestrogenic and that the inactivation of andro- gen receptors and progesterone receptors and of the 5- α -reductase activity is secondary to the estrogen receptor blockade.”7 Serenoa standardized extracts do not affect systemic levels of androgens, follicle-stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone in men with BPH.8 This may help explain the relatively low incidence of adverse effects of this substance in clinical trials. These findings do not, however, rule out localized effects of saw palmetto on androgen or estrogen effects in other tissues of the body. Various locally produced growth factors also play a role in the patho- genesis of BPH, and liposterolic extracts of Serenoa block the ability of one of them, basic fibroblast growth factor, to induce prostatic hyperpla- sia in vitro.9 High prolactin levels may also stimulate prostate hyperpla- sia; Serenoa extracts interfere with this process in rats, unlike finasteride.10 Saw palmetto extracts exert antispasmodic effects on smooth mus- cle. Rat smooth muscle was originally shown to be inhibited by two Serenoa extracts owing to inhibition of calcium ion influx.11 A later study found that Serenoa extract but not pumpkin seed extract, sting- ing nettle root extract, or β -sitosterol consistently inhibited human α1 -adrenergic receptors in vitro.12 Whether this effect is relevant clin- ically is still unknown. The standardized extract has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, and the polysaccharide components have been shown to have immunostimulatory effects.13–16 Serenoa extract and myristoleic acid– induced apoptosis and necrosis in an androgen-sensitive human pros- tate cancer cell line in vitro.17

is also preliminary evidence that saw palmetto may also help counter male-pattern baldness and chronic prostatitis. On the basis of its phar- macology, this extract may also be of benefit in conditions of androgen excess in women, such as hirsutism and polycystic ovary disease.

## Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The major symptoms of BPH (increased urinary frequency, night- time awakening to empty the bladder, and reduced force and caliber of urination; see Chapter 154), have been shown to be significantly improved by saw palmetto extract in more than a dozen double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials (summarized in Table 112.1).18–31 At least four meta-analyses have combined data from these and other trials and concluded that, despite some limitations in trial design, Serenoa extracts have been shown to reduce symptoms of BPH and increase urine flow in comparison with placebo without affecting prostate volume.32–36 One of these analyses also concluded that Serenoa extracts are as effective as the 5- α -reductase–inhibiting drug finas- teride (Proscar), with significantly fewer adverse effects.37 In another meta-analysis, it was concluded that saw palmetto extracts were not superior to a placebo for symptoms of BPH but were just as effective as finasteride and tamsulosin.35 However, this analysis was strongly affected by a single negative trial involving 225 men with moderate to severe BPH randomized to receive Serenoa extract 160 mg twice daily or a placebo.19 After 1 year of treatment, there was no significant differ- ence in the scores on the American Urological Association Symptom Index and the maximal urinary flow rate in men receiving 320 mg per day of the liposterolic Serenoa extract or the placebo. Secondary out- come measures, including changes in prostate size, residual urinary volume after voiding, quality of life, laboratory values, and the rate of reported adverse effects also did not differ between the two groups.

## 850SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

These results may simply indicate that treatment of moderate to severe BPH is likely unresponsive to Serenoa therapy. A large negative clinical trial of Serenoa in 369 men with mild to moderate BPH failed to show a benefit for up to 960 mg/day of standardized extracts compared with the placebo.38 The single largest (n = 1069) clinical trial of Serenoa extract com- pared 160 mg of Serenoa twice daily with finasteride 5 mg daily for weeks.37 The two agents were equally effective at improving symptoms (by 37%–39% on average) and increasing peak urine flow (by 38%– 41% on average). Although finasteride decreased prostate volume and levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) significantly, Serenoa extract had no such effect. Finasteride caused significantly more sexual side effects than saw palmetto. In a double-blind comparison trial, 542 men with BPH symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either the α blocker tamsulosin or Serenoa extract for 1 year.39 The two groups showed identical levels of improvement in symptoms. Tamsulosin was more frequently associ- ated with ejaculatory disorders than Serenoa extract. In the subset of patients with the most severe BPH in this trial, Serenoa extract was actually statistically significantly superior to tamsulosin at relieving symptoms.40 In a separate double-blind trial involving 329 men with BPH symptoms, tamsulosin combined with placebo was just as effec- tive as tamsulosin combined with Serenoa extract at relieving symp- toms.41 Adding Serenoa extract to tamsulosin caused no alteration in adverse effects. A 6-month double-blind trial of Serenoa extract with 60 men found results very similar to those of the prior two studies, although it also demonstrated an equivalent improvement in maxi- mum flow rate between the groups.42 Serenoa may work most effectively in combination with Urtica urens root extract. In a long-term study, the efficacy and tolerability of this combination were investigated in a prospective multicenter trial compris- ing elderly male patients suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by BPH. A total of 257 patients were randomized to treat- ment with the combination (320 mg of Serenoa and 240 mg of U. urens extracts per day) or placebo. After a single-blind placebo run-in phase of weeks, the patients received either the study medication or placebo under double-blind conditions over 24 weeks. The double-blind treatment was followed by an open control period of 24 weeks during which all patients were given the Serenoa and U. urens combination. Outcome measures for treatment efficacy included the assessment of the patients’ LUTS by means of a self-rating questionnaire and a quality-of-life index in addition to uroflow and sonographic parameters. Using the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), patients treated with the Serenoa and U. urens combination exhibited a substantially higher total score reduction after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment than patients of the placebo group (6 points vs. 4 points; P = 0.003), with a tendency in the same direction after 16 weeks. This applied to obstructive and to irritative symptoms and to patients with moderate or severe symptoms at baseline. Patients random- ized to placebo showed a marked improvement in LUTS (as measured by the I-PSS) after being switched to the Serenoa and U. urens combination during the control period.43

## Chronic Prostatitis

Several clinical trials indicate that S. repens may have clinical benefit in chronic prostatitis or pelvic pain. One double-blind, randomized trial compared S. repens extract alone with a combination of S. rep- ens, selenium, and lycopene in men with nonbacterial chronic pelvic pain.44 After 8 weeks, the two groups had equivalent improvements in symptoms, whereas only the combination product lowered PSA and levels of white blood cell in urine. One study used a combination of S. repens extract 160 mg, Urtica dioica root extract 120 mg, quercetin 100 mg, and curcumin 200 mg once daily with the antibiotic prufloxacin 600 mg once daily in men with bacterial prostatitis.45 One fourth of the 143 subjects were randomly assigned to take prufloxacin alone. Treatment lasted 14 days. One month after treatment, patients in the combination group were dramatically more likely (88% vs. 27%) to be symptom-free than the antibiotic-only group. Subsequent randomized trials confirm that saw palmetto extract by itself and in combination with selenium, lycopene, bromelain, and methylsulfonylmethane or arbutin and Lactobacillus sporogenes enhance the efficacy of antibiotics in patients with chronic prostatitis.46–48

## Male-Pattern Baldness

A combination of 400 mg S. repens extract and 100 mg beta-sitosterol daily was found effective for male-pattern baldness in a pilot dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial.49 The 5-month trial involved men with mild to moderate baldness. Sixty percent (6 of 10) of the men in the treatment group were rated as having improved by blinded observers, whereas only 11% (1 of 9) of men in the placebo group were rated as improved. Thirty-three percent (3 of 9) of the men in the pla- cebo group showed deterioration compared with none in the treat- ment group. There were no major adverse effects. A comparative trial in 100 men over 2 years found that finasteride 1 mg was superior to S. repens extract 320 mg for improving baldness, but both extracts did lead to significant increases in hair growth compared with baseline.50 An open trial in 50 men found that a topical S. repens extract applied for 4 weeks effectively improved hair growth lasting 24 weeks.51


The dosage for the liposterolic extract of saw palmetto fruit (containing 85%–95% fatty acids and sterols) is 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg daily; the two regimens have been shown to be equally effective.52 A similar dosage using fluid extracts and tinctures would require extremely large quantities of alcohol if the liposterolic components were the primary active constituents. The Eclectics used comparatively small dosages of saw palmetto in crude extracts effectively for BPH with apparent clini- cal success. Ellingwood4 lists a dose as 10 drops to 1 dram of specific S. repens (meaning basically a fresh drupe tincture). We are unaware of any published clinical study of a crude extract. Dosages are as follows: • Crude drupes: 10 g twice a day • Liposterolic extract (standardized at 85%–95% fatty acids and ste- rols): 160 mg twice a day or 320 mg once a day The dosage of fluid extracts or tinctures is typically 3 to 5 mL two to three times per day, although there is a lack of research on this dose form.


No significant adverse effects have been reported in clinical trials of the saw palmetto fruit extract or for saw palmetto drupe ingestion; rates of mild adverse effects are no different than those seen with placebo treatment.53 Mild gastrointestinal upset and erectile dysfunction (in approximately 1% of users in clinical trials)3 occasionally occur.


No drug–herb interactions had been reported as of 2019. One clinical trial found no effect of saw palmetto liposterolic extract on CYP3A4 or 2D6 in healthy adults.56

## 852SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Perhaps the most impressive of silymarin’s protective effects is against the severe poisoning by Amanita phalloides (the “death cap” or toadstool mushroom), an effect that has long been recognized in folk medicine. Ingestion of A. phalloides or its toxins causes severe poison- ing and, in approximately 30% of victims, death. Among the experimental models for measuring protection against liver damage, those based on amanitin or phalloidin tox- icity are the most important because these two peptides from A. phalloides are the most powerful liver-damaging substances known. Silymarin has demonstrated impressive results in these experimen- tal models. When silymarin was administered before amanita toxin poisoning, it was 100% effective in preventing toxicity.4 Even if given 10 minutes after the amanita toxin, it completely counteracted the toxic effects. In two cases reported in the literature, silymarin prevented death and greatly reduced the amount of liver damage up to 24 hours after ingestion of A. phalloides.5 This study reported on a husband and wife who ate toxic mushrooms and experienced gastrointes- tinal symptoms 18 hours later. Despite initial conventional treat- ment with gastric emptying, intravenous fluids, activated charcoal, and a duodenal tube, both patients’ laboratory parameters showed deteriorating liver and renal function. Mild hepatic encephalopa- thy developed in one of the patients. Treatment with intravenous silybinin at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, penicillin, and glu- cose for 3 days resulted in a reversal of both the organ failures and encephalopathy. Silymarin may also be of great value as an adjunct in patients receiving long-term drug therapy. A very interesting study found that silymarin, in an unusually high dose of 800 mg/day, given to psychi- atric patients receiving phenothiazines or butyrophenones resulted in significant protection of the liver as measured by malondialdehyde serum liver enzyme levels.6 The silymarin did not interfere with the efficacy of the antidepressants.

## Stimulation of Hepatic Protein Synthesis

Perhaps the most interesting effect of Silybum components on the liver is their ability to stimulate protein synthesis. This results in an increase in the production of new liver cells to replace the damaged old ones. Sonnenbichler and Zetl7 have suggested that “silybinin imi- tates in some way a physiological regulator in animal cells, so that the structure fits into a specific binding site on the polymerase and in such a way causes the observed effects on rRNA synthesis making the drug from Silybum marianum indeed interesting for liver therapy.” Interestingly, silybinin does not have a stimulatory effect on malig- nant hepatic tissue.8

## Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Leukotrienes, key chemical mediators of inflammation produced by the transfer of oxygen to polyunsaturated fatty acids (a reaction catalyzed Fig. 113.1 Silybum marianum. (From iStock.) Steroid structure Synthesis of DNA and RNA Alteration of the hepatocyte external membrane Scavenging free radicals Cellular glutathione content Modifying the transporters and receptors of cell membranes lipid peroxidation Entrance of the xenobiotics into the cell Example: Amanita Poisoning Regenerative ability of the liver cells Fig. 113.2 Different mechanisms of action of silymarin. Mechanisms include increasing the regenerative ability of the liver cells by enhancing the synthesis of DNA and RNA, as silymarin has a steroid structure; alter- ing the structure of the hepatocyte external membrane, which prevents entrance of the xenobiotics into the cell (poisoning with Amanita mushroom is a noteworthy example of such mechanism); and scavenging free radicals and increasing the cellular content of glutathione, which leads to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Another mechanism of action of silymarin is modifying the transporters and receptors of cell membranes such as ABC transporters (P-gp), organic anion uptake transporter peptides (OATPs), bile salt export pump, and tumor necrosis factor-α–dependent transporters. (From Karimi G, Vahabzadeh M, Lari P, Rashedinia M, Moshiri M. “Silymarin,” a promising pharmacological agent for treatment of diseases. Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2011;14[4]:308–317.

by the enzyme lipoxygenase), can also damage the liver. Silymarin has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, thereby inhibiting the formation of damaging leukotrienes. Silymarin has also been demonstrated to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis during inflammation. Free-radical damage to membrane structures due to organic disease or intoxication results in an increased release, through lipolysis, of fatty acids. This leads, among other things, to greater prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. Silymarin counter- acts this deleterious process by suppressing the pathological decom- position of membrane lipids and inhibiting prostaglandin formation. Leukotrienes and inflammatory prostaglandins are also involved in damage of the liver by toxins, so their neutralization by silybin is another mechanism for its protection of the liver.

## Anticancer Effects

Silymarin has shown significant anticancer effects in both in vivo and in vitro cancer models—including skin, breast, lung, colon, bladder, pros- tate, and kidney carcinomas—as well as adjunctive actions when combined with standard cancer therapies.9 Some of the effects noted include that it: • Prevents the expression of genes and enzymes pivotal in cancer development • Modulates imbalance between cell survival and apoptosis through interference with the expression of cell-cycle regulators and pro- teins involved in apoptosis • Exerts significant antimetastatic effects • Has a synergistic effect when combined with conventional chemo- therapy agents, including growth inhibition, reversal of chemo- resistance, apoptosis induction, and reduced chemotherapy side effects in a variety of models These preliminary studies suggest a clinical application in cancer patients as an adjunct to established therapies to prevent or reduce chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy-induced toxicity.6 Considering the significant problem of serious nephrotoxicity from cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic agents, silybinin may be of great value as an adjunct in the treatment of cancer.

## Other Pharmacological Actions

Silymarin shows antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell culture infection, including inhibition of virus entry, RNA and protein expression, and infectious virus production.10 In animal studies, silymarin has been shown to increase the proliferation of lymphocytes as well as levels of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 cytokines in a dose-dependent manner.11 Silymarin is a strong inhibitor of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase, being 13 to 50 times more active than the- ophylline and 1 to 3 times more active than papaverine.11 Silymarin has also been shown to prevent the toxic effects of a variety of compounds, such as hemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine, damage from x-irradi- ation, and brain edema induced by triethyltinsulfate. Presumably these effects are related to silymarin’s significant membrane-stabilizing and antioxidant actions. Its action in increasing the osmotic resistance of red blood cells is also quite significant. S. marianum extracts are particularly indicated for metabolic syn- drome because they have been found to exhibit antioxidant, lipid-low- ering, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antiatherosclerotic, antiobesity, and hepatoprotective effects.12 Silymarin exerts significant immunomodulatory effects. As an immunomodulator agent, silymarin inhibits T-lymphocyte function at low doses, whereas it stimulates inflammatory processes at high doses. Studies have shown that silymarin has attenuated autoimmune, allergic, preeclampsia, cancer, and immune-mediated liver diseases and also has suppressed oxidative and nitrosative immunotoxicity. Silymarin also has indicated dual effects on proliferation and apoptosis of different cells.13 In patients with hemochromatosis, silybin administration at meals was shown to reduce iron absorption.14


Silymarin’s primary use is as an aid to the liver, although additional clinical applications are regularly being discovered. This substance can be used to support detoxification reactions or in the treatment of more severe liver disease. In numerous clinical studies, silymarin has been shown to have positive effects in treating several types of liver disease, including the following2: • Cirrhosis • Chronic hepatitis • Chemically induced liver damage • Alcohol-induced fatty liver • Nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis • Subclinical cholestasis of pregnancy • Cholangitis and pericholangitis The therapeutic effect of silymarin in these disorders has been con- firmed by histological, clinical, and laboratory data. Silymarin may also be useful in improving the solubility of the bile in the treatment of gallstones as well as in psoriasis and as a galactagogue.

## Alcohol- and Chemically Induced Liver Damage

In one of the first extensive double-blind clinical trials investigating silymarin’s therapeutic effect in liver disorders, the substance demon- strated impressive results in 129 patients with toxic metabolic liver damage, fatty degeneration of the liver of various origins, or chronic hepatitis who were compared with a control group of 56 patients. The results might have been even more impressive if the study had lasted longer than 35 days.15 A follow-up study of patients with liver damage due to alco- hol, diabetes, viruses, or toxic exposure yielded even more striking results. Patients were monitored for 7 weeks. Not only were clinical findings markedly improved in the silymarin-treated groups, but laboratory and liver biopsy data improved as well. Highly signifi- cant results were obtained in bromsulphalein retention as well as in measurements of alanine transaminase (ALT), iron, and cholesterol levels. Biopsy showed remarkable tissue-restorative effects. Upon completion of silymarin therapy, restitution of normal cell struc- ture was found even in severely damaged livers. These effects on the tissue level correlated well with improvements in blood chemistry values.16 Another study highlighted the benefit of silymarin in individuals exposed to toxic chemicals. In this study, abnormal results of liver function tests (elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and ALT activity) and/or abnormal hematological values (low plate- let counts, increased white blood cell [WBC] counts, and a relative increase of lymphocytes compared with other WBCs) were observed in 49 of 200 workers exposed to toxic toluene and/or xylene vapors for 5 to 20 years.17 Thirty of the affected workers were treated with sily- marin, and the remaining 19 were left without treatment. Under the influence of silymarin, liver function parameters and platelet counts significantly improved. The WBC counts also showed a tendency toward improvement. Pooled data from case record studies involving 452 patients with A. phalloides poisoning show a highly significant difference in mortality in favor of silymarin therapy. The mortality rate for silymarin therapy is 9.8%, compared with 18.3% for standard treatment.18

## Steatohepatosis

Silymarin is also helpful in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis (NASH). In a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial of consecutive adults with biopsy- proven NASH and an NAFLD activity score (NAS) of 4 or more, patients were randomly assigned to groups given silymarin (700 mg) or placebo (n = 50 patients) three times daily for 48 weeks. After this 48-week period, liver biopsies were repeated. Although there was no effect on the primary efficacy outcome of a decrease of 30% or more in NAS, the findings from 48-week liver biopsies showed that a sig- nificantly higher proportion of patients in the silymarin group had reductions in fibrosis based on histology, and based on liver stiffness measurements, than did the placebo group. The silymarin group also had significant reductions in mean ratio of aspartate aminotransfer- ase to platelet index, Fibrosis-4 score, and NAFLD fibrosis score; these changes were not observed in the placebo group.19

## Cirrhosis

As previously described, silymarin is quite effective in treating alcohol-re- lated liver disease. There is a tremendous range in the severity of alcohol-re- lated liver disease, from relatively mild to serious damage, such as cirrhosis. Even in this severe state, silymarin has shown benefit. Perhaps the most sig- nificant benefit is in extending the life spans of patients with these disorders. In one study, 87 patients with cirrhosis (46 with alcoholic-related cirrhosis) received silymarin, whereas 83 patients (45 with alcoholic cirrhosis) received a placebo.20 The mean observation period was months. In the treatment group, there were 24 deaths, 18 related to liver disease; in the control group, there were 37 deaths, 31 related to liver disease. The 4-year survival rate was 58% in the treatment group compared with 39% in the controls. Analysis of the results of five trials involving a total of 602 patients with liver cirrhosis demonstrated that although silymarin produced a statistically insignificant reduction of total mortality by 4.2% in com- parison with placebo, it did lead to a statistically significant reduction in liver-related mortality of 7%.21 Silymarin can also improve immune function in patients with cirrhosis.2

## Viral Hepatitis

Silymarin is useful in helping reverse virally induced liver damage. It is effective in both acute and chronic viral hepatitis. In one study of acute viral hepatitis, 29 patients treated with silymarin showed a defi- nite therapeutic influence on the characteristic increased serum lev- els of bilirubin and liver enzymes compared with a placebo group.22 The laboratory parameters had regressed more in the silymarin group than in the placebo group by the fifth day of treatment. The number of patients attaining normal liver values after 3 weeks of treatment was significantly higher in the silymarin group than in the placebo group. In a double-blind study of various causes of acute hepatitis, patients were given either a standard recommended dose of 140 mg of silymarin or a placebo three times daily for 4 weeks. Patients randomized to the sily- marin group had a quicker resolution of symptoms related to biliary reten- tion: dark urine, jaundice, and scleral icterus. There was a reduction in indirect bilirubin among those assigned to silymarin, but other variables, including direct bilirubin, ALT, and AST, were not significantly reduced.23 In a study of chronic viral hepatitis, silymarin was shown to result in dramatic improvement. Used at a high dose (420 mg) for periods of 3 to 12 months, silymarin resulted in a reversal of liver cell damage (as noted on biopsy), a rise in protein level in the blood, and a lowering of liver enzyme values. Common symptoms of hepatitis (e.g., abdominal discomfort, decreased appetite, and fatigue) were all improved.24 Silymarin has been studied in hepatitis C, with little evidence of efficacy. In a meta-analysis of five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 389 patients were randomly treated with silymarin or placebo. Silymarin was well tolerated in chronic HCV-infected patients, but there was no evidence of positive effects for oral silymarin, although intravenous silybin did show some benefits.25

## Gallstones

Silymarin may help prevent or treat gallstones through its ability to increase the solubility of the bile. In one study, the composition of the bile was assayed in 19 patients with a history of gallstones (4 patients) or removal of the gallbladder due to gallstones (15) before and after silymarin (420 mg/day for 30 days) or placebo. Silymarin treatment led to a significant reduction in the biliary cholesterol concentration and bile saturation index.26

## Psoriasis

Correction of abnormal liver function is indicated in the treatment of psoriasis. Silymarin has been reported to be of value in the treatment of psoriasis; this effect may be due to its ability to inhibit the synthesis of leukotrienes and improve liver function.27 The connection between the liver and psoriasis relates to one of the liver’s basic tasks, filtering of the blood. Psoriasis has been shown to be linked to high levels of circulating endotoxins, such as those found in the cell walls of gut bacteria. If the liver is overwhelmed by an increased number of endotoxins or chemical toxins or if the liver’s functional ability to filter and detoxify is decreased, the psoriasis is aggravated. Another factor in psoriasis is excessive production of leukotrienes. Silymarin has been shown to reduce leukotriene formation by inhibit- ing lipoxygenase. Therefore silymarin would inhibit one of the causes of the excessive cellular replication. Silymarin has other effects of value in patients with psoriasis. Most of them revolve around correcting the abnormal ratio of cAMP to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) observed in the skin of patients with psoriasis. The ratio of these two cellular control agents governs cellular replication. In psoriasis, cGMP levels are high relative to cAMP levels. Silymarin works to lower cGMP levels and raise cAMP levels.

## Silymarin as a Galactagogue

A micronized form of silymarin has been shown to exert clear galact- agogue effects. In a double-blind study in 50 healthy lactating women, micronized silymarin (420 mg/day) increased daily milk production by 86%, compared with 32% for the placebo. Milk quality was unaffected. The galactagogue effect may be the result of increased circulating pro- lactin levels.28

## Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome

Given the liver’s involvement in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome, silymarin is almost assuredly of benefit in these conditions. Several clinical trials have been conducted. In the most recent, patients with T2D were randomly assigned to the silymarin (140 mg three times daily) or placebo groups for 45 days. Silymarin supplemen- tation led to a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar (–11), serum insulin (–14%), the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resis- tance (–26%), serum triglycerides (–24%), and the ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (–28%) compared with the placebo. There was a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index in the silymarin group compared with the placebo group, by 6.88% and 5.64% respectively. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol concentrations significantly decreased in the silymarin group

compared with the baseline, by 7.93% and 7.15%, respectively.29 In the same study, silymarin supplementation also improved some anti- oxidant indices (SOD, GPX, and TAC) and decreased high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels.30 Silymarin may also help reduce the complications of diabetes, including nephropathy, neuropathy, healing delays, oxidative stress, hepatotoxicity, and cardiomyopathy.31

## Silybin Bound to Phosphatidylcholine

Given the poor relative bioavailability of silymarin components, meth- ods are being developed to increase their bioavailability to improve clinical effects. One enhanced form of silymarin binds silybin to phos- phatidylcholine. Research indicates that phosphatidylcholine-bound silybin is better absorbed and produces better clinical results than other forms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Absorption Studies

Several human and animal studies have shown that phosphatidylcho- line-bound silybin is better absorbed. In one study, the excretion of silybin, the major component of silymarin, in the bile was evaluated in patients undergoing gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy). A drain- age tube, the T-tube, was used to sample the bile. Patients were given either a single oral dose of the silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex or silymarin. The amount of silybin recovered in the bile in free and conjugated form within 48 hours was 11% for the silybin-phosphati- dylcholine group and 3% for unmodified silybin group.32 One of the significant features of this study is the fact that silymarin has been shown to improve the solubility of the bile. Because more silybin is being delivered to the liver and gallbladder when the phos- phatidylcholine-bound silybin is used, this form is ideal for individuals with gallstones or fatty infiltration of the liver, two conditions charac- terized by decreased bile solubility. In another study, plasma silybin levels were determined after administration of single oral doses of silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex and a similar amount of silymarin to nine healthy volunteers. Although absorption was rapid with both preparations, the bioavail- ability of the silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex was much greater than that of silymarin, as indicated by higher plasma silybin levels at all sampling times after intake of the complex. The researchers in this study concluded that complexation with phosphatidylcholine greatly increases the oral bioavailability of silybin, probably by facilitating its passage across the gastrointestinal mucosa.33

## Clinical Studies

Several clinical studies have shown phosphatidylcholine-bound silybin to be more effective than silymarin. In one study, eight patients with chronic viral hepatitis (three with hepatitis B, three with both hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and two with hepatitis C) were given one capsule of phos- phatidylcholine-bound silybin (equivalent to 140 mg silymarin) between meals for 2 months.34 After treatment, serum malondialdehyde levels (an indicator of lipid peroxidation) decreased by 36%, and the quantitative liver function evaluation as measured by galactose elimination capacity increased by 15%. A statistically significant reduction of liver enzymes was also seen: AST diminished by 17%, and ALT rose by 16%. In another study designed primarily to evaluate the dose– response relationship of phosphatidylcholine-bound silybin, pos- itive effects were again displayed.35 In this study, patients with chronic hepatitis due to either a virus or alcohol were given dif- ferent doses for 2 weeks: 20 patients received 80 mg twice daily, received 120 mg twice daily, and 20 received 120 mg three times daily. At all tested doses, phosphatidylcholine-bound silybin pro- duced remarkable and statistically significant decreases in mean serum and total bilirubin levels. When used at the dose of 240 or 360 mg/day, it also resulted in remarkable and statistically signifi- cant decreases in the liver enzymes ALT and gamma-glutamyl-tran- speptidase. These results indicate that even short-term treatment of viral- or alcohol-induced hepatitis with relatively low doses of phos- phatidylcholine-bound silybin can be effective; for the best results, however, higher doses are needed. Treatment with phosphatidylcholine-bound silybin is associated with reduced body iron stores, especially among patients with the advanced fibrosis stage of chronic viral hepatitis.36


The standard dose of milk thistle is based on its silymarin content (70– 210 mg three times daily). For this reason, standardized extracts are preferred. The best results are achieved at higher dosages—210 to mg of silymarin three times daily. The dosage for silybin bound to phosphatidylcholine is 120 to mg twice daily. Alcohol-based extracts are virtually always contraindicated in liver disease because a relatively large amount of alcohol is administered to obtain an adequate dose of silymarin in this form.


Silymarin preparations are widely used, with a considerable body of evidence pointing to very low toxicity. When used at high doses for short periods, silymarin given by various routes to mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs has shown no toxic effects. Studies in rats receiving silymarin for protracted periods have also demonstrated a complete lack of toxicity.1 Because silymarin possesses choleretic activity, it may produce a looser stool as a result of greater bile flow and secretion. If higher doses are used, it may be appropriate to use bile-sequestering fiber com- pounds (e.g., guar gum, pectin, psyllium, oat bran) to prevent mucosal irritation and loose stools. Because of silymarin’s lack of toxicity, its long-term use is feasible when necessary.


Although silymarin components have been shown to interact with drug-metabolizing cytochrome P 450 enzymes in in vitro studies, the concentrations showing inhibitory effects are not achieved with nor- mal dosage recommendations.37 Clinical studies have shown that coadministration of silymarin with drugs metabolized by P 450 enzymes (e.g., indinavir) causes no adverse interactions.38,39

(the aglycones genistein, daidzein, and glycitein, and their glycoside forms genistin, daidzin, and glycitin) per gram of protein, and con- sidering all forms of each individual isoflavone, the breakdown of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein supplied by soy foods is approxi- mately 50%, 40%, and 10%, respectively.3 Commonly consumed soy foods are generally considered rich sources of dietary isoflavones.4 In fermented soy foods like tempeh, miso, soy sauce, and natto, aglycone forms generally dominate, whereas glycosides are the major forms in nonfermented foods such as soy milk, soy flour, protein powders, edamame, soy nuts, and tofu, as well as in most dietary supplements.5 Isoflavone contents and proportions in soy foods vary according to plant parts and genetics; growing and harvesting conditions; and stor- age, extraction, and processing methods. The typical isoflavone con- tents of several soy products and their relative provisions of genistein and daidzein are given in Table 114.1. For those interested in learning the isoflavone contents of hundreds of foods and beverages, the most recent version of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Database on the Isoflavone Content of Selected Foods is available online at https://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata, under Flavonoid Databases. The average daily intake of isoflavones among Japanese women is 20 to 80 mg, whereas that of American women is about 1 to 3 mg,6 a manifold difference. Isoflavone intakes among various Chinese pop- ulations are estimated to range from around 10 to 40 mg daily7 but are quite low among Europeans and Canadians, averaging less than mg daily.8,9 Among Westerners, many health-conscious consumers are eating soy foods more frequently, and in one British study, vegans and vegetarians showed the highest intakes, receiving up to 30 g soy protein and 130 mg soy isoflavones daily.10 Patients with breast cancer at one U.S. hospital were found to have mean daily genistein and daidzein intakes of 11.6 mg and 7.4 mg, respectively—much higher than the American average.11 Americans consume less soy than the Chinese and Japanese but tend to ingest more in dietary supplements and in pro- cessed food forms such as texturized vegetable protein and isolated soy protein, which are added to meat substitutes, breads, processed meats, and other foods. Up to 25% of formula-fed infants consume soy-based formula, and these infants can show higher isoflavone concentrations on a body-weight basis than those of adults with high soy intakes.12 Isolated soy protein contains all essential amino acids and has a Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) of 1.0, the highest score possible, although other soy protein preparations may display PDCAAS scores of as low as 0.9.13–15 Soy is considered one of the eight major food allergens, with albumin, globulin, and prolamin proteins being its primary allergenic constituents in sensitive individuals. Other soy constituents of interest include phytosterols, saponins, protease inhibitors, and phytates. Phytosterols bind cholesterol in the gut, and although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),16 Health Canada,17 and the European Union’s European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)18 have approved health claims regarding the cho- lesterol-lowering effects of plant sterols added to foods, naturally occurring levels in soy may be insufficient to derive such benefits.

saponins may also contribute to the influence of soy foods through their anticholesterol effects.19 Raw soybeans contain several protease inhibitors, but their inactivation during processing into soy food prod- ucts makes it unlikely that they have much effect in humans. Phytates have been shown to interfere with the absorption of some minerals, yet they also display strong antioxidant and antitumor properties.20,21

## Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion of Isoflavones

Primary human exposure to isoflavones comes from the diet, and although other plants such as red clover (Trifolium pratense) and kudzu (Pueraria lobata) contain isoflavones, only soy foods supply physiologically relevant amounts of isoflavones in the human diet. Much evidence indicates wide individual variation in absorption and metabolism of isoflavones, which is influenced by the composition of the intestinal microbiome, liver metabolism, enterohepatic circula- tion, and habitual intakes of soy foods, and coingestion of prebiotic and probiotic foods may also have effect.22,23 Dietary soy isoflavones occur bound to sugars that are not read- ily absorbed and may be modified extensively in the gastrointestinal tract, although the degree of metabolism and absorption varies con- siderably among individuals.24,25 Intestinal and bacterial glucosidases release genistein and daidzein from genistin and daidzin, after which they may be conjugated through sulfation or glucuronidation, dehy- droxylated, reduced, or demethylated to give rise to metabolites of varying biological activity, including S-(-)equol, 5-hydroxyequol, O-desmethylangolensin, dihydrogenistein, and others. Genistein and daidzein may also circulate freely or be bound to plasma proteins and are distributed widely in body tissues.26 Isoflavones attain maximal plasma levels 4 to 8 hours after ingestion and are excreted within hours, mainly in urine but also in feces.27 Metabolites of soy isofla- vones include compounds with molecular structures similar to those of reproductive steroid hormones (Fig. 114.3). The relative bioavailability of isoflavone glycoside and aglycone forms is debated, and numerous articles have weighed in on both sides of this question. Aglycones from soy products were absorbed more quickly and completely than glycosides in several studies,28–31 although others have shown the converse or no difference.32–34 Further research and survey of the evidence may reveal differences among individuals or populations that account for these seemingly conflicting findings. A number of clinical trials in both genders in various disease states have hinted that the ability to produce the human metabolite S-(-) equol from its isoflavone precursor daidzein (through the intermediate dihydroequol) may hold unique health benefits. Franke et al. cite stud- ies showing that about 60% of vegetarians and Asians produce equol, whereas only about 30% to 35% of omnivores do so.35 Infants and children aged 6 to 36 months showed gradually increasing equol pro- duction in one study, particularly those receiving soy milk– or cow’s milk–based formula and those not receiving antibiotics.36 It may be useful to note that the R-(+)equol isomer is not an endogenous human form. Setchell et al. found that S-(-)equol is a selective estrogen recep- tor- β agonist (with about one-fifth the affinity of estradiol)37 and yet also noted, with interest, that it is an androgen antagonist.38 Lampe reports that although research findings are mixed, equol production has been associated with lower breast density in response to weekly soy consumption as well as better bone protection with isoflavone intake and greater improvements in cholesterol levels and brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation with soy germ supplementation in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Equol producers among postmeno- pausal women in Hong Kong had significantly higher fat-free body mass and significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as well as lower levels of triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and free fatty acids compared with nonproducers.39 Miller et al. did not find a significant association between equol production status and body mass index (BMI) or obesity in peri- and postmeno- pausal women, although BMI and obesity related to the inability to convert daidzein into a different metabolite, O-desmethylangolensin.40 Although genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors relating to equol pro- duction status are still unclear, Lampe has suggested that it may cor- relate with lactose malabsorption.41 Several research groups have noted that adults also may change from nonproducer to producer status after heightened soy consumption, although not all studies concur. Franke et al. found that both post- and premenopausal women may begin to produce equol with increased iso- flavone exposure.42,43 Healthy Caucasian men with isoflavone intakes above 30 mg daily for at least 2 years were over five times likelier to produce equol than those consuming 5 mg or less daily.44 Tanaka et al. found that after 3 months of isoflavone supplementation, healthy Japanese male nonproducers showed detectable serum equol levels.45 Development of a recognized, validated testing method and threshold equol value or equol-to-daidzein ratio will aid future interpretation of evidence. Early in vitro research suggests that soy isoflavones may constitute an energy substrate for the proliferation of equol-producing intesti- nal microbes and enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); both equol and SCFAs are increasingly considered pivotal in delivering isoflavone benefits.46 Nakatsu et al. found significant increases in fecal Bifidobacteria in postmenopausal women after just 1 week of consuming bars containing 160 mg soy isoflavones and 1 g saponin, particularly among equol producers; this team noted associa- tions of Bifidobacteria, Collinsella, and Lactococcus with equol or other isoflavone metabolites, although the significance of these relationships is not yet fully understood.47 However, consistent global changes in gut populations of major bacterial groups were not seen in meno- pausal equol producers or nonproducers given 80 mg isoflavones for months, although equol producers showed increased counts for total microbial fecal populations, whereas overall counts in nonproducers decreased significantly. In some women, growth of phytoestrogen-me- tabolizing microorganisms such as Bifidobacteria, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Collinsella may have been facilitated by increased exposure to isoflavones and/or their metabolites, although in several cases this appeared to depend more on the individual microbiome than metabolite producer status.48


Soy isoflavones (and their metabolites) and other soy constituents have shown varied activities in humans, animals, tissues, and cells (Table 114.2).

## Hormonal Effects of Soy

The degree to which soy foods modify endogenous hormone influ- ences in both genders is of prime importance in evaluating their benefits, and long-term observation of populations that consume con- siderable amounts of soy foods may hold the most complete answers OHO OH

to this question. The possibility that long-term or lifelong soy food use may alter the composition of the gut microbiome to induce equol production points toward greater impacts from lifestyles rather than simply “grafting” single foods like soybeans into a Westernized diet. Research is also increasingly considering genetic characteristics that interact with diet and lifestyle to change disease risk for certain sub- populations. Much evidence suggests that soy foods generally exert a mild to moderate inhibitory effect on reproductive hormones and their binding proteins in most populations and that this may explain the reduced risk for breast and prostate cancers enjoyed by people in countries consuming higher levels of soy foods.

the FDA and EFSA for safe use.49,50 However, the potential for estro- genic effects in infants given soy formula has raised long-term safety concerns. The relative proportions of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein in soy formula are about 58% to 70%, 22% to 44%, and 4% to 16%, respectively. Infants fed soy formula show higher levels of genistein and daidzein compared with most other populations, although Asian infants consuming traditional diets and vegan infants also have rela- tively high levels.51,52 A safety review and meta-analysis by Vandenplas et al. concluded that children given modern soy infant formula show growth and development patterns similar to those seen in infants fed cow’s milk or breastmilk in regard to immune, neurological, reproduc- tive, endocrine, bone, and metabolic parameters,53 and the Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center 5-year study of the same forms of infant nutrition reached a similar conclusion.54 A 2008 statement updating the American Academy of Pediatrics’ 1998 review of soy-based infant formula found no conclusive evidence that soy formula adversely affects human development or endocrine (including thyroid) or repro- ductive functions but noted the following: 1. Soy formula is not recommended for use in preterm infants. 2. Soy formula is contraindicated for use in infants with hereditary fructose intolerance or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (although it is safe in infants with galactosemia or primary lactase deficiency). 3. Soy formula is not needed by infants with lactose intolerance (as opposed to overt lactase deficiency). 4. Soy formula should not be given to infants with cow’s milk enterop- athy or enterocolitis due to the likelihood of cross-sensitivity. 5. The use of an extensively hydrolyzed soy protein–based formula (although not nonhydrolyzed) can be considered for infants with immunoglobulin E–mediated cow’s milk allergy.55 Andres et al. found that 1-year-old infants given cow’s milk– or soy-based formula showed no differences in mental, motor, or lan- guage development, and although breastfed infants showed slightly higher scores in some areas, all three groups scored within normal ranges.56 Portman et al. identified a significantly increased risk for Kawasaki disease in ethnically diverse U.S. children with high intakes of total isoflavones and of genistein compared with those with low intake levels, whereas maternal intakes during pregnancy did not show a relationship with the incidence of the disease in offspring.57

## Women

Findings among women vary considerably by life stage, lifestyle, and genetic individuality. A 2009 meta-analysis by Hooper et al. of soy’s effects in 579 premenopausal, 69 perimenopausal, and 1165 post- menopausal women concluded that soy isoflavones may lower folli- cle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and extend the menstrual cycle by about 1 day premenopausally and may nonsignificantly increase total (but not free) estradiol levels post- menopausally.58 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) in more than 200 postmenopausal women given 80 or 120 mg isoflavones over years showed no evidence of changes in endometrial thickness, estra- diol or estrone sulfate levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) lev- els, or incidence of adverse events compared with placebo.59 Fuhrman et al. showed in 2009 that regular soy intake in Asian American women aged 20 to 55 is associated with increased formation of the weakly estrogenic 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) and decreased production of the more potent, more persistent, and more genotoxic α -hy- droxyestrone (16 α -OHE1) for an overall significant increase in the 2/16 α -OHE1ratio.60 Nettleton et al. found that breast cancer survivors consuming soy protein isolate with isoflavones show increased 2-OHE1 and α -OHE1 levels without a change in ratio, although subjects with high plasma equol levels also showed a significant increase in the 2/16 α -OHE1 ratio; an interesting finding was that breast cancer survi- vors generally demonstrated lower baseline 2/16 α -OHE1 ratios com- pared with controls.61 Postmenopausal Thai women given a fermented soybean preparation providing about 60 mg isoflavones showed no change in estradiol levels but a significant increase in progesterone lev- els and a significant decrease in total cholesterol, and the researchers suggested that soy supplementation may induce progesterone receptor expression.62 A 2010 meta-analysis of eight RCTs found no effect of dietary iso- flavones on breast density in women in general and postmenopausally but showed a possible modest increase in breast density (a mean of 1.83%) in premenopausal women with higher intakes,63 although a review of 14 observational studies by Maskarinec et al. did not find an association between soy intake and mammographic density.64

Noted soy researcher Mark Messina in 2010 found no evidence that isoflavone supplements or isoflavone-rich soy foods affect levels of estrogens or total or free testosterone in men, and that they have no effect on sperm, semen, or erectile function in men, even considering intake levels above those commonly consumed by male Asian pop- ulations.65 Dillingham et al. observed that healthy young men sup- plemented with soy protein isolate with either low or high levels of isoflavones showed significantly decreased dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels as well as DHT/testosterone ratios compared with those given milk protein isolate, and the low-isoflavone soy group also showed significantly increased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels as well as smaller increases in estradiol and estrone sulfate relative to the milk protein isolate group.66 A 2010 meta-analysis of clinical studies on the effects of soy on testosterone-related values in men found no signif- icant influence of either soy protein or isoflavones on free androgen index or testosterone, free testosterone, or sex hormone–binding glob- ulin (SHBG) levels, although inclusion of small and/or short-term trials may have limited the findings.67 However, in healthy Japanese males aged 30 to 59 given 60 mg soy isoflavones daily for 3 months, levels of DHT and free testosterone decreased, whereas SHBG levels increased significantly in equol producers but not nonproducers; an intriguing finding was that serum equol levels in 2 of 10 previous non- producers became detectable by the end of this trial.68

## Cardiovascular Disease

Soy foods are considered heart-healthy overall due to their generous contents of fiber, polyunsaturated fats, vitamins, minerals, and phy- tonutrients as well as their low saturated fat levels.70 Interest in the potential role of soy protein and isoflavones to reduce risk factors asso- ciated with cardiovascular and related metabolic diseases stems from decades of human and preclinical research that formed the basis for the 1999 FDA-approved health claim for soy foods and coronary heart disease, stating that “25 g of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.”71 In 2008 the FDA received a petition to revoke this health claim, but despite denying that petition, the FDA decided to reconsider its position and to again review the scientific evidence. Late in 2017 the FDA announced a proposal to revoke the claim, mainly due to diffi- culty in achieving “significant scientific agreement” among the mixed results seen among heterogeneously designed intervention studies regarding soy intake and cardiovascular outcomes.72 The American Heart Association (AHA) has acknowledged that soy foods are ben- eficial for cardiovascular and overall health but concluded that the direct cholesterol-lowering effects of soy protein were of relatively little

significance.73 On the other hand, a 2017 study of cost-effectiveness of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched foods determined that encourag- ing and subsidizing preventive use of such products would likely bring cost savings to healthcare systems and improve cardiovascular dis- ease (CVD) outcomes, particularly among men and older age groups; it estimated that at only 50% compliance, 69 CVD events could be avoided per 10,000 men over 20 years.74 Beneficial cardiovascular effects of consuming soy foods seen in many human studies appear to be stronger when they replace (rather than merely supplement) common dietary proteins with higher satu- rated fat contents. Epidemiological studies in populations that com- monly consume soy foods have shown that higher intakes may be inversely related to incidences of coronary events such as nonfatal myocardial infarction75,76 and heart disease mortality,77 although some suggest that results may be gender dependent. In 2011 Hodis et al. found after a 3-year clinical trial that 25 g soy protein enriched with 99 mg isoflavones nonsignificantly reduced the progression of atherosclerosis (via carotid intima media thickness) in postmenopausal women and proposed that a longer exposure period may have resulted in more significant differences because changes observed between the treatment groups increased as the study pro- gressed.78 In two studies, higher soy intake was found to significantly correlate to reduced incidence of heart disease,79,80 and another con- cluded that consumption of soy phytoestrogens might prevent the progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women.81 A Japanese study of more than 40,000 adults aged 40 to found that women consuming soy foods at least five times weekly had a relative risk for CVD mortality of about 0.31 times that of women eating soy foods two or fewer times per week; women (especially post- menopausal) with higher soy food consumption also showed signifi- cantly decreased risks for myocardial and cerebral infarction in this study.82 However, a 2015 nested case-control study in postmeno- pausal Chinese women aged 40 to 70 who had never used hormone replacement therapy found that a high intake of soy isoflavones was modestly yet significantly associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke; from the lowest to highest consumption levels, the relative risk ranged from 1.0 to 1.24 compared with baseline, yet no relation was found between urinary isoflavone metabolite excretion and risk.83 A 2014 study in Singaporean Chinese adults did not find significant asso- ciations between soy protein intake and cardiovascular mortality or isoflavone intake and death from coronary heart disease.84

## Cholesterol Metabolism

An enormous amount of research has examined the influences of soy on cholesterol metabolism. Despite broad variety in soy preparations and great heterogeneity among study designs, a fairly consistent result has been that regular intake of soy foods, especially in place of more common animal protein sources, leads to modest yet meaningful cho- lesterol reductions in hypercholesterolemic individuals. Soy’s main mechanisms of action for this appear to be interfering with choles- terol absorption, increasing fecal bile acid excretion, and upregulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression. A 2008 meta-analysis evaluating the provision of 25 grams of soy protein daily concluded that it resulted in a small but significant 6% decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels in normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic adults.85 A large meta-analysis by Anderson et al. comparing soy and animal protein diets found a significant 12.9% decrease in serum lipids with soy protein, especially in subjects with hypercholesterolemia.86 More recent meta-analyses show consistent LDL lowering with soy protein but at a more modest average reduction of 3% at a daily intake of about 50 grams.87,88 A 2007 meta-analysis of soy isoflavones by Taku et al. found that they significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels, with larger changes in hypercholester- olemic subjects,89 and a meta-analysis of soy protein containing isofla- vones by Zhan et al. arrived at a similar conclusion.90 Individual studies can provide detailed insights. Jenkins et al. found that hyperlipidemic men and women receiving soy protein with isofla- vones in addition to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step II diets showed significantly lower total cholesterol, estimated coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, total/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, LDL/HDL ratio, and apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio than those using the Step II diet alone; LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, homocysteine, and oxidized LDL levels were also lower with soy than during the Step II diet alone. This study also demonstrated that men receiving soy showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with the Step II diet alone and that during high-isofla- vone intakes, LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were lower than during the Step II diet alone.91 In a study of a similar design by Baum et al., hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women receiving soy protein and isoflavones in addition to NCEP Step I diets showed a greater decrease in non-HDL cholesterol than those receiving Step I diets alone, and those receiving soy protein and isoflavones also showed increases in HDL cholesterol as well as in LDL receptor RNA levels compared with decreases in both measures in those receiving Step I diets alone.92 Those with type 2 diabetes receiving soy protein isolate showed reduced LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, and apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio compared with those receiving milk protein isolate.93 In 2012, Wong et al. found that although soy foods reduced LDL cholesterol levels equally in hyperlipidemic equol pro- ducers and nonproducers, equol producers maintained higher HDL levels than nonproducers.94 In postmenopausal women, Allen et al. found that those receiving soy protein containing isoflavones rather than casein showed significant reductions in total and LDL choles- terol levels as well as in LDL particle number.95 Puska et al. found that hypercholesterolemic subjects receiving soy protein plus isoflavones and fiber showed significant decreases in total and LDL cholesterol levels compared with controls, and the soy group also showed a sig- nificant decrease in homocysteine levels, whereas controls showed an increase.96 In a study of healthy U.S. adults, those receiving soy protein showed significantly better improvement in HDL cholesterol levels and HDL/total cholesterol ratios compared with subjects given milk protein.97 Chinese equol-producing postmenopausal women receiving 40 g soy flour showed significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and hs-CRP compared with subjects receiving either milk powder plus mg daidzein or milk powder alone.98 The results of a 2010 study by Wong et al. suggest that soy foods’ potential benefits to lipid profiles may be significantly improved by combination with a prebiotic like inulin. Hyperlipidemic men and women given 30 g soy protein, 61 mg soy isoflavones, and 10 g oligof- ructose-enriched inulin showed significant improvements in measures of LDL and HDL cholesterol compared with either soy or prebiotic alone.99 Although the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has approved the use of cholesterol-lowering claims on certain soy products in Japan, the EFSA does not allow such claims on EU food products.

## Blood Pressure

Soy protein and/or isoflavones may also have modest effects on blood pressure (BP), although research results have been mixed. Considerable heterogeneity in study design, as well as dosage and form of soy used, may interfere with the interpretation of overall study results, and ade- quately powered studies comparing the effects of different soy prepa- rations could provide further clarification.

## 862SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Healthy 50- to 75-year-old men and postmenopausal women receiving 40 g soy protein with 118 mg isoflavones versus casein showed significant reductions in BP.100 Soy milk consumption for 3 months has also lowered mean, systolic, and diastolic BP values in hypertensive men and women compared with those receiving cow’s milk; urinary genistein levels correlated significantly with decreases in BP.101 Sagara et al. found that middle-aged men with elevated total cholesterol and/ or BP levels receiving soy protein plus soy isoflavones showed signifi- cant reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, total cholesterol, and non- HDL cholesterol levels compared with active placebo, and they also showed significant increases in HDL-cholesterol.102 Soy protein has been shown to lower BP in perimenopausal women, and soy protein with dietary fiber may reduce BP in both men and women.103,104 Not all studies agree, though, and both the Agency for Health Research and Quality (which evaluates evidence presented for FDA health claims) and the AHA have concluded that neither soy protein nor isoflavones have hypotensive effects.105,106 However, an interesting 2017 study of Japanese adults aged 40 to 69 found that fermented (but not unfer- mented) soy product intake was inversely associated with the devel- opment of hypertension, with an odds ratio of 0.72 in the highest tertile of intake.107 A 12-month RCT in postmenopausal women aged 60 to 75 found that among those receiving soy protein containing mg isoflavones, systolic and diastolic BP decreased in equol producers and increased in nonproducers compared with subjects receiving milk protein.108

## Cardiometabolic Disease Factors

Studies exploring soy foods and cardiometabolic outcomes are increas- ingly examining soy constituents’ mechanisms of action beyond cholesterol-lowering, looking more closely at their influences on macro- nutrient metabolism, endothelial function, and inflammatory markers. A 2017 review by Ramdath et al. found that soy isoflavones and their metabolites appear to improve blood pressure, glycemic control, obesity, and inflammation and may act in synergy with soy protein and other constituents to modulate plasma lipids as well as satiety.109 Another 2017 systematic review by Chalvon-Demersay et al. found evidence that consuming soy protein associated with isoflavones in place of more common animal proteins may help prevent the onset of risk factors associated with cardiovascular conditions and metabolic syndrome, such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.110 A meta-analysis of isoflavones in postmenopausal women found that daily intake levels of about 50 to 100 mg markedly improved endo- thelial function in subjects with impairment,111 and a 2015 crossover RCT showed that adults at cardiometabolic risk consuming soy nuts providing 101 mg total isoflavones daily for 1 month displayed sig- nificantly improved arterial stiffness as measured by peripheral arterial tonometry.112 In middle-aged and older Chinese women, higher soy food intake is inversely associated with levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α and interleukin (IL)-6, proinflammatory markers for meta- bolic and cardiovascular risk.113

## Body Composition, Weight, and Glucose Metabolism

In studies relating to energy metabolism and weight, soy protein and isoflavones have displayed a number of intriguing properties that could potentially aid in the maintenance of glycemic control, weight, and body composition, perhaps especially during aging. This growing evi- dence represents an exciting opportunity for populations challenged by dysglycemia, weight concerns, and excess adiposity. As detailed in this section, soy has shown effects on peroxisome proliferator-acti- vated receptors (PPARs), sirtuins, mTOR, and other cellular targets, which suggests complementary and even synergistic effects of soy on these energy-sensing and metabolism-altering pathways. A review of clinical and preclinical evidence found that higher intakes of soy isoflavones may inhibit enlargement of adipose tissue through modifying signaling in pathways relating to fatty-acid and glucose metabolism, although some of these effects may be mediated by equol production.114 Soy protein has been shown to spare muscle mass in overweight and obese subjects losing weight,115 and subjects receiving a diet high in soy protein demonstrated improved glycemic control and lipid profiles.116 A randomized, controlled weight-loss study of soy milk–based meal replacements (MRs) versus cow’s milk– based MRs found that soy milk MRs resulted in slightly greater weight loss and significant reductions in serum triglyceride levels compared with cow’s milk MRs.117 A 12-week study conducted by Charles et al. in healthy postmenopausal women found that daily consumption of 20 grams of soy protein containing 160 mg total soy isoflavones sig- nificantly increased levels of adiponectin (an adipokine hormone considered to have anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic proper- ties), whereas those receiving soy protein without isoflavones showed significant improvements in levels of the proinflammatory marker TNF- α .118 Another study using the same 20 g soy protein plus 160 mg isoflavones daily dosing versus casein protein in normal or overweight postmenopausal women found that the soy combination reduced total and subcutaneous abdominal fat, whereas casein increased both measures, with a significant difference between treatments.119 A third study, again using the same dosing, in obese African American and white postmenopausal women found that compared with casein, soy reduced total or abdominal fat (in African American and white women, respectively) and significantly lowered levels of IL-6, increas- ingly considered a biomarker for cardiovascular risk.120 Overweight Chinese adults receiving a low-calorie diet based on soy protein showed significantly greater reductions in body fat, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol and on liver function tests compared with subjects receiving a low-calorie diet based on traditional protein sources; both groups experienced significant drops in weight, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI).121 A 12-week trial of soy nuts or textur- ized soy protein in older women with metabolic syndrome found that either type of soy food mildly improved overall body composition and lipid profile compared with controls.122,123 Perimenopausal women receiving 40 g soy protein plus 80 mg isoflavones showed significantly increased hip lean tissue and reduced thigh fat over 24 weeks compared with those receiving low-isoflavone soy protein and whey protein.124 In postmenopausal women, genistein supplementation significantly decreased fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and fibrinogen levels as well as HOMA-IR values.125 Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) given 50 mg isoflavones daily for 12 weeks showed significant improvements in markers of insulin resistance and oxidative stress as well as significant reductions in free androgen index and triglyceride levels compared with controls.126 It is worthwhile to note that soybeans have a low glycemic index of about 14 to 20 (against glucose) or 20 to 29 (against white bread) as well as a low glycemic load.127 Asian women consuming higher levels of soy foods display lower risks for type 2 diabetes,128,129 and a 2011 meta-analysis by Liu et al. found that consumption of whole soy foods was associated with significantly reduced fasting glucose con- centrations.130 Soy protein with high isoflavone content lowers fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c, insulin resistance, and LDL cholesterol levels in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes, and postmenopausal women with higher intakes of genistein seem to have lower BMIs, waist circumferences, and fasting insulin levels than those with lower intakes.131,132 Proposed mechanisms for soy’s effects on weight, body composi- tion, and glycemic control include increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids; slowing gastric emptying; activation of mTOR to aid skeletal

muscle anabolic processes133; improving glucose transport; increasing tissue insulin sensitivity; improving insulin receptor affinity; upregu- lation of PPAR α ,134 PPAR γ /PGC-1 α ,135 and LXR expression136; stim- ulation of adiponectin; and inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis, among others.137 In animals fed a high-fat Western diet, those given soy protein isolate developed less insulin resistance, hypercholester- olemia, and hepatosteatosis compared with those given casein.138 In rats fed a high-sucrose diet, soy protein reversed the resulting hepatos- teatosis, normalized glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation, improved insulin sensitivity, and limited weight and visceral fat gain.139 Genistein has displayed protective effects on pancreatic beta cells, improvement of insulin and glucose metabolism, improvement of endothelial function, and reduction of leptin levels, and it may also potentiate insulin secretion; these effects may account for some of the reduced risk for type 2 diabetes and beneficial effects on insulin and glucose metabolism observed in humans consuming soy or soy components.140–144 Early research suggests that soy or its components may indirectly and/or directly activate or upregulate human sirtuin 1, although the significance of these findings is not yet known.145–147 Sirtuins are NAD- dependent enzymes involved in genomic stability, cell cycles, gene transcription, and glucose and lipid metabolism148 and may be impli- cated in the benefits of full-nutrition caloric restriction.


The first clue that soy might convey protection from cancer came from epidemiological studies of Asian cultures with high soy food intakes showing lower rates of several types of cancers. In an important review, Messina et al. identified 10 studies demonstrating that nonfer- mented soy products were associated with decreased risks for breast, prostate, lung, stomach, colon, and rectal cancers, although results were mixed for fermented soy foods, which showed positive relation- ships to esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers in some studies.149

## Breast Cancer

Breast cancer occurs in Chinese women at one-third to one-half the rate seen in Caucasian women, and evidence suggests that dietary and lifestyle factors, including lifelong soy intakes, outweigh genetic factors in this difference.150 Because breast tumor tissue may elaborate much higher concentrations of β -estradiol, especially in postmenopausal women,151 and the estrogen-modulating effects of soy isoflavones may be useful for them, thorough evaluation of individual variations in metabolism, genetics, and receptor sensitivity is advisable. In a 2011 meta-analysis of prospective studies on soy isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk, Dong et al. found a protective effect of soy for both the incidence and recurrence of breast cancer in Asian populations.152 Trock et al. conducted a meta-analysis of soy protein intake and breast cancer risk and found a modest but significant risk reduction (odds ratio of 0.86) at high intake levels, with stronger effects in premenopausal women.153 Examining a wider range of studies, Qin et al. also found a relative breast cancer risk of 0.75 among those with higher soy food intakes, with isoflavone intakes contributing to this effect.154 A 2013 study of Japanese women showed lower breast cancer risk among postmenopausal (although not premenopausal) women with moderate or higher soy intakes,155 and a 2014 systematic review of studies in Japanese women reached an analogous conclusion.156 A study among Chinese women found that soy isoflavone and protein intakes decreased overall breast cancer risk, with the strongest asso- ciations in postmenopausal women and for estrogen- and progester- one-receptor positive breast cancer,157 and a 2010 study among Korean women had similar findings.158 In a multiethnic U.S. population with considerably lower isoflavone intakes than in Asian populations, no significant relationships were seen between isoflavones and overall breast cancer risk, although the data suggested that subpopulations with higher intakes may enjoy greater protection159; among those later diagnosed, prediagnostic soy intake was not related to breast cancer mortality.160 In an RCT of U.S. women with increased breast can- cer risk, Khan et al. found that soy isoflavones altered the activities of genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, and estrogenic effect, yet the researchers did not observe either positive or negative effects on breast epithelial cell proliferation over 6 months.161 A 2013 systematic review of isoflavones concluded that soy intakes comparable to those among the Japanese (providing ∼ 25–50 mg isoflavones daily) may pro- tect against the incidence and recurrence of breast cancer as well as mortality.162 Although most studies have found more postmenopausal benefits relating to soy and breast cancer, studies in Shanghai and Guangzhou have also uncovered evidence for reduced premenopausal breast cancer risk at higher intakes of soy isoflavones and protein; the Guangzhou study also noted protective effects for all subtypes of estro- gen- and progesterone-receptor status.163,164 A few studies also suggest an inverse relationship between exposure to soy and/or its constituents during childhood or adolescence and future breast cancer risk.165–167 A 2012 pooled analysis of 9514 breast cancer survivors in the United States and China found that intakes of at least 10 mg isoflavones daily were associated with significantly reduced risk of breast cancer recur- rence and nonsignificantly reduced risks for breast cancer–specific and all-cause mortalities.168 Two studies included in this analysis found especially strong protection among tamoxifen users, thus contributing to the evidence that isoflavones may not interfere with this important therapy.169,170 Women with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ aged 30 to 75 receiving 50 mg soy isoflavones for 12 months showed no significant changes in breast mammographic density or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fibroglandular tissue density.171 Kang et al. found that postmenopausal patients with breast cancer with estrogen- and progesterone-receptor–positive disease and high isofla- vone intakes receiving tamoxifen or anastrozole had a significantly reduced risk for recurrence compared with those with lower intakes, although such associations were not seen in premenopausal patients.172 A U.S. study of postmenopausal women with abnormal mammograms found no association between equol production and breast pathology but also noted that isoflavone intakes among these women were quite low (mean value 0.3 mg), which likely precluded findings.173 The intestinal milieu may play an important role in the effects of soy foods on breast cancer risk. In a very interesting 2013 study conducted by Toi et al., regular consumption of both soy isoflavones and the probiotic Lactobacillus casei Shirota showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in breast cancer risk, with relative risk decreasing from 0.76 to 0.48 through the second to fourth quartiles of intake174; this probiotic strain may help convert soy isoflavone glycosides into their aglycone forms and beneficially influence the microbiota in which isoflavone metabolism takes place.175 Soy may also modulate breast cancer recurrence or mortality. Among Korean women with breast cancer, Woo et al. noted in that although isoflavone intake was inversely associated with recurrence in HER2-negative patients, among HER2-positive patients, high isofla- vone intake increased recurrence risk.176 Single-nucleotide polymor- phisms (SNPs) in genes coding for the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and its binding proteins may affect the risk for breast cancer. In 2016 Wang et al. found that one such polymorphism combined with being either overweight or underweight and having a low isoflavone intake could virtually double breast cancer risk in gen- eral Chinese female populations as well as postmenopausal women.177 Another Chinese study also found that higher soy intake interacted

## 864SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

with another IGF-related polymorphism to significantly reduce IGF-1 levels, which, when elevated, increase breast cancer risk.178 Soy intake may also interact with genetic variation in SNPs for PPAR γ ; Lee et al. found one that, combined with high soy consumption, was associated with reduced mammographic density compared with low soy con- sumption, with a decrease of almost 4% in density per copy of the allele in the highest quartile of intake.179 Other relationships among breast cancer risk, soy intake, and SNPs are being discovered as well.180,181

## Prostate Cancer

The incidence of prostate cancer is much lower in Japan than in Western nations; however, among Japanese migrants to areas where a Western diet is consumed, prostate cancer rates are six times higher than in their native population.183 High soy intake among Japanese men is thought to contribute to these findings. A comprehensive 2018 meta-analysis of 30 studies examining the relationship between soy and prostate cancer concluded that total soy food intake, as well as genistein, daidzein, and unfermented soy food intakes, are associated with a significantly reduced risk for prostate cancer; it further clarified that circulating isoflavone levels were not related to advanced prostate cancer risk.182 A 2014 meta-analysis by van Die et al. found modest support for soy and soy isoflavones in reducing prostate cancer risk, and although the researchers concluded that soy and isoflavone supplementation displayed a good safety profile, they noted that soy’s effects on pros- tate-specific antigen (PSA), testosterone, and SHBG levels were not clear.184 Two 2009 meta-analyses also cautiously concluded that higher soy food intakes reduced prostate cancer risk.185,186 In 2012 Miyanaga et al. found that Japanese men aged 50 to 75 with PSA levels of 2.5 to 10 ng/mL receiving 60 mg soy isoflavones daily showed a nonsignifi- cant reduction in the risk of prostate cancer compared with placebo, but significantly reduced risk was seen in subjects aged 65 or older; the relatively low incidence of prostate cancer among Japanese men may have precluded significant overall results.187 In 2015 Wu et al. found that patients with prostate cancer in China had significantly lower median genistein levels in plasma compared with nonprostate cancer patients, suggesting that genistein intake may potentially contribute to the low incidence of prostate cancer in China.188 In a 2008 Japanese nested case-control study by Kurahashi et al. of men at least 40 years old, higher levels of genistein and equol were dose-dependently asso- ciated with significantly reduced risk for total and localized prostate cancer,189 and similar results were seen in an earlier study by Ozasa et al.190 In examining diet and lifestyle effects on prostate cancer risk, Leitzmann and Rohrmann concluded that the lack of risk reduction seen in Western countries was due to Western soy intakes not being high enough to produce comparable inverse associations.191 The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study did, however, find a significant inverse relationship between plasma genistein concentrations and prostate cancer risk.192 A systematic review suggests that equol producers may have significantly less risk for developing prostate cancer193; in rats, equol binds dihy- drotestosterone and prevents it from interacting with the androgen receptor.194 A 2004 Australian study in men with prostate cancer given bread made with soy grits found that the soy bread lowered total PSA levels and increased the free/total PSA ratio compared with wheat bread.195 A 2013 multicenter RCT of the effects of 20 g soy protein with 160 mg isoflavones on hot flashes in men with prostate cancer found no effect, although several quality-of-life scores significantly improved over the 12-week study.196 Soy intake may also interact with SNPs relating to estrogen and aro- matic hydrocarbon metabolism to modify prostate cancer risk. Sonoda et al. discovered a CYP1A1 polymorphism associated with reduced prostate cancer risk despite soy isoflavone intake under 60 mg daily, but a different polymorphism at the same location in combination with an estrogen-receptor SNP may connote high prostate cancer risk even at higher isoflavone intakes.197

## Other Cancers

Dietary intakes of soy and its components have also generally been associated with reduced risk for other cancers, although the potential for estrogen-modulating effects to contribute to hepatocellular carci- noma risk in women should be noted. A 2016 meta-analysis of 22 case-control and 18 cohort studies relating soy intakes and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers found small reductions in combined GI cancers as well as colon and colorectal cancers in pooled analysis, whereas subgroup analysis for isoflavones found stronger protective associations with higher intake levels.198 A case-control study by Shin et al. concluded that compared with lower isoflavone intakes, Korean men and women in the highest quartile showed a reduced risk for colorectal cancer. Stronger relations between soy food intake were found for postmenopausal women, distal colon cancer in men, and rectal cancer in women, but high intake of fer- mented soy paste was associated with an elevated risk of colorectal can- cer in men.199 In a Chinese population, data trended toward protective effects of nonfermented soy foods on gastric cancer, although over- all findings did not reach significance,200 but an earlier study found that soy foods may reduce colorectal cancer risk in postmenopausal women.201 A study in a Japanese population found that high intake of soy, especially nonfermented forms, was associated with significantly reduced risk for stomach cancer, which occurs with a higher incidence in Japan than in Western regions.202 Although an earlier Japanese study in an older population did not reach this same conclusion, it uncovered a trend toward increased gastric cancer risk among women with high isoflavone intakes taking exogenous female hormones.203 A 2008 study of Japanese men and women aged 45 to 74 found no sub- stantial effect of soy foods and isoflavones on overall colorectal cancer risk, although proximal colon cancer risk in men was inversely related to soy and isoflavone intakes.204 Among Dutch men aged 40 to 75 at increased risk for colorectal cancer, Vrieling et al. noted that equol producers receiving 84 mg of isoflavones showed an inverse associa- tion between serum equol level and that of IGF-1,203 which is positively linked to increased risk for colorectal and other cancers. In a multiethnic population of postmenopausal U.S. women aged 45 to 75, higher isoflavone intakes were associated with reduced risk for endometrial cancer,206 although analogous findings for isoflavones from traditional soy foods were not seen in a Japanese study of women of similar age, which may be partially attributable to the low incidence of this disease in Japan.207 A 3-year RCT of soy protein with isoflavones in postmenopausal women in the United States found no significant influence on endometrial thickness or incidences of endometrial can- cer or hyperplasia,208 although results of an earlier case-control study suggest that total isoflavone intake may reduce endometrial cancer risk among lean women.209 A 2014 meta-analysis and a 2011 case-control study have found some evidence that soy foods or isoflavones may reduce the risk for ovarian cancer,210,211 but a prospective Swedish study showed no significant relationship between soy foods and ovar- ian cancer risk at any age.212 A 2013 meta-analysis showed a borderline inverse association between soy protein intake and the risk for lung cancer, which was significant in nonsmokers.213 Yang et al. found a significant inverse relationship between soy food intake and the risk for lung cancer (par- ticularly aggressive forms) in Chinese women (especially nonsmok- ers),214 and the same research team also demonstrated significant soy

food and isoflavone protection from lung cancer mortality in women with lung cancer, which was stronger among never-smokers.215 Other studies have shown that estrogen therapy increased the incidence of and mortality from lung cancer,216 whereas tamoxifen reduced lung cancer deaths in patients with breast cancer,217 supporting an estro- genic link to lung cancer etiology. In 2009 Kurahashi et al. identified a dose-dependent positive asso- ciation between genistein and daidzein intakes in women (but not in men) and the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Natto and tofu consumption showed the strongest associations among soy food types, and the relationship was also seen in women positive for either or both hepatitis virus B (HBV) and hepatitis virus C (HCV); the authors sug- gested, based on previous research in Asian populations, that estrogen may play a protective role against HCC.218 A distinctive 2003 study by Haselkorn et al. showed an inverse rela- tionship between soy isoflavone intake and the risk for thyroid can- cer in Southeast Asian women living in the United States, although contributions from other factors were also important.219 Genistein has shown in vitro synergy with photodynamic therapy used to induce apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells.220 One accepted mechanism by which soy isoflavones modulate the risk for hormone-related conditions is by competing with endogenous estrogens for estrogen receptor binding while providing a fraction of the hormonal influence of estrogen, thereby modulating estrogen’s stronger influences on cell growth and proliferation; isoflavones are estimated to have about 1/1000th the potency of estradiol activation at estrogen receptor (ER)- α and around one third of estrogen’s potency at ER β .221 Direct chemopreventive and antiproliferative mechanisms of action for soy components and metabolites have also been investi- gated, including inhibition of angiogenesis222; antagonism of steroid hormone and growth factor signaling pathways; modulation of prosta- glandin metabolism; dihydrotestosterone binding and sequestration223; modification of DNA methylation and other epigenetic events224,225; encouraging cell differentiation; inhibiting matrix metalloprotease (MMP) production and related cancer cell detachment, invasion, and metastasis226,227; DNA repair; upregulation of BRCA1 expression228; inhibiting androgen receptor and PSA expression229; inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)- κ B pathway activation, DNA topoisomerase,230 and α -reductase231; antioxidative effects; and influencing a variety of kinases related to cell cycles, cellular energy production, and apop- tosis.232–234 Fan et al. found that genistein may inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and encourage apoptosis in these cells by inhibiting stem cell activation and early tissue development.235 Genistein, soy iso- flavones, and equol have been shown to modulate aromatase activity both positively and negatively in laboratory work, and although there is little clinical evidence to confirm how soy influences aromatase in humans, genistein could potentially interact with drugs used to inhibit aromatase.236–240 Genistein may also enhance the activities of other chemo-, photo-, and radiotherapies, although the specificity and extent of these effects are not fully understood.241

## Menopausal Symptoms

The observation that Japanese women experience around one-tenth the incidence of vasomotor symptoms in menopause compared with women consuming Western diets led to great interest in causative fac- tors, including phytoestrogens such as those in soy.242 More recent research has focused on soy isoflavones and on the daidzein metabolite equol. Considering the risks associated with hormone replacement, soy foods and their ingredients may present a reasonable alternative to many women. In a 2016 crossover RCT by Tranche et al., postmenopausal women with menopausal symptoms receiving 15 g soy protein with 50 mg isoflavones showed significant reductions in climacteric and urogeni- tal symptoms and significantly improved health-related quality-of-life scores on the Menopause Rating Scale compared with controls.243 A 2012 meta-analysis by Taku et al. found that soy isoflavone supple- mentation (generally more than 50 mg daily) decreased the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes by 20.62% and 20.19% over placebo, respectively,244 and a 2014 review of clinical trials of isofla- vones for menopausal symptoms came to a similar conclusion.245 Postmenopausal Brazilian women receiving 60 mg soy isoflavones daily showed significant reductions in hot flashes compared with pla- cebo as well as increased estradiol and HDL levels, reduced LDL levels, and no changes in vaginal cytology.246 S-Equol has been commercially produced using a human strain of Lactococcus on soy germ, and Japanese nonequol producers with menopausal symptoms receiving 10 mg of this S-equol preparation experienced fewer and less severe hot flashes and less neck and shoul- der stiffness and showed trends toward the improvement of other symptoms as well.247 A 2015 study of perimenopausal women found that about 35% produced equol, and that among equol producers, those in the highest quartile of daidzein intake were 76% less likely to have vasomotor symptoms than those in the lowest quartile, whereas there was no association between daidzein and vasomotor symptoms in nonproducers.248 An earlier study employing S-equol for meno- pausal symptoms found that in nonproducers, supplementing 30 mg S-equol significantly decreased all symptom scores except for depres- sion, whereas overall results in producers and nonproducers showed significant improvements in measures of depression, tension/anxiety, fatigue, and vigor.249 A 2017 cross-sectional study of breast cancer survivors found that the highest soy food intake correlated with halving of menopausal symptoms and fatigue250; however, in a study of Chinese women aged 20 to 75 being treated for breast cancer, higher soy food intake was not found to reduce menopausal symptoms and was associated with an increased number of hot flashes in premenopausal patients.251

## Osteoporosis

A considerable body of research has been devoted to investigating the impact of isoflavones with or without soy protein on measures of bone mineral density (BMD), bone formation, and bone resorption. Several meta-analyses and RCTs in peri- and postmenopausal women have concluded that soy isoflavones (with or without soy pro- tein) can attenuate spinal bone loss (especially lumbar), decrease levels of bone resorption markers, and/or increase levels of bone formation in these at-risk populations.252–258 A 2010 meta-analysis of isoflavones including 1240 menopausal women indicated that an average intake of 82 mg soy isoflavones significantly increased spinal BMD by 22.25 mg/ cm (2.38%) over 6 to 12 months compared with controls, although similar results were not found at the hip.259 A 2009 randomized cross- over trial in postmenopausal women found that isoflavones from soy suppressed net bone resorption, although to a lesser extent than 5 mg risedronate or 1 mg estradiol plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone. The researchers noted that serum genistein levels reflected antiresorptive effects, whereas those of daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin did not.260 A 2-year multicenter trial of 120 mg soy isoflavones in menopausal women found reduced whole-body bone loss yet not at the hip or lumbar spine; other evidence suggested that higher genistein delivery may have contributed to isoflavone effects previously seen in the lumbar spine.261 This contrasts the 2015 conclusion of Pawlowski et al. that mixed isoflavones were more effective than a genistein-rich isoflavone preparation in increasing bone calcium retention in post- menopausal women. In this randomized trial, equol production status did not alter the effects.262 A review of 15 clinical trials by Messina

et al. reported that although clinical data indicate daily intake of approximately 80 mg isoflavones is needed to derive skeletal bene- fits, epidemiological evidence suggests that lower amounts may also be efficacious.263 Sathyapalan et al. showed that women experiencing early menopause and receiving 15 g soy protein with 66 mg isoflavones daily for 6 months showed significant reductions in a marker of bone resorption as well as reductions in fasting insulin and glucose, insulin resistance, and systolic blood pressure, whereas no changes in insulin resistance or blood pressure were seen in women receiving soy protein alone.264 The same research team provided this treatment to men with type 2 diabetes with hypogonadism and found that it also significantly reduced the same marker of bone resorption in this population and that the drop correlated positively with reductions in Hb A 1c levels and HOMA-IR scores.265 In pre- or early menopausal Chinese women, Chi et al. noted that 90 mg isoflavones daily increased tibial bone den- sity, reduced menopause-related symptom scores, and lowered levels of alkaline phosphatase, IL-6, and TNF- α .266 In Taiwanese women in early postmenopause (a particularly susceptible period), 100 mg iso- flavones significantly increased lumbar and femoral neck BMD after 1 year of supplementation.267 In breast cancer survivors, however, soy isoflavone intakes over ∼ 62 mg daily have been associated with lower proximal forearm BMD, especially early in menopause.268 The evidence thus points to isoflavones as the soy component responsible for the beneficial bone effects observed.269 They may act by binding estrogen receptors, regulating estrogen receptor gene expres- sion, increasing serum osteocalcin levels, influencing alkaline phos- phatase activity, increasing insulin-like growth factor transcription in bone, decreasing TNF- α levels, and modulating gene expression of bone-related genes, among other mechanisms.270 In vitro research by Tadaishi et al. suggests that carotenoids such as beta-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin may cooperate with soy isoflavones in suppressing the formation of osteoclasts and thereby reducing bone resorption.271 It may be interesting to note that although soy milk contains oxalate and phytate, which are known to inhibit calcium absorption, these com- pounds did not negatively affect the uptake of this mineral from calci- um-fortified soy milk in women.272

## Cognitive Function

Despite modest positive trial results in the early 2000s,273–275 more recent direct evidence for cognitive benefit from soy and isoflavones is lacking. However, the indirect effects of soy constituents on estrogen and energy metabolism, cardiovascular function, and redox homeosta- sis may contribute to overall cognitive health. A 2015 meta-analysis of lifestyle contributions to cognitive decline concluded that soy isoflavones may improve memory without affecting global cognition.276 The largest and longest trial in this analysis found improvements in measures of visual memory,277 although further analysis found an inverse association between urinary isoflavonoids and general intelligence test scores.278 Healthy men receiving 116 mg isoflavones daily showed improvements in measures of spatial working memory.279 Postmenopausal women in the United States receiving g soy protein with 160 mg isoflavones for 12 weeks showed no signifi- cant change in cognition.280 Follow-up analyses on data collected in the Women’s Health Initiative and its Memory Study found evidence of a positive effect on cognitive function from isoflavones, although not all studies concurred.281 Two 2007 studies found no cognitive changes in postmenopausal women after isoflavone supplementation.282,283 A notable recent finding is that, among older Japanese, equol produc- tion has been identified as an independent risk factor for mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI).284 Men and women with Alzheimer’s disease receiving 100 mg isoflavones daily for 6 months showed no changes in cognition compared with placebo, although plasma equol levels correlated positively with measures of speeded dexterity and verbal fluency.285

## Fatty Liver Disease

Limited research suggests that soy consumption may hold benefits for fatty liver disease. A 2014 study in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared the effects of a low-calorie diet (LCD), a low-carbohydrate LCD, and low-carbohydrate LCD containing soy found that the soy-containing diet produced greater reductions in ala- nine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST), fibrinogen, and malondialdehyde compared with the other diets.286 A 2012 review of the mechanisms of NAFLD concluded that soy constituents may pre- vent or even reduce fatty accumulation in the liver by modifying lipid metabolism and the genetic expression of sterol regulatory-element binding proteins and PPAR α .287 In patients with hepatitis C given 32 g soy protein daily, significant reductions in ALT levels were seen, and in a subgroup (34.7%) with steatosis, it significantly improved associated measures, including gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels.288

## Soy Isoflavone Safety

(Please also refer to Pharmacology and Clinical Applications sections.) Soy products are generally well tolerated, and the most common adverse effects are constipation, bloating, and nausea, although insom- nia, migraines, rash, itching, and hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. In perhaps the most comprehensive review of soy isoflavone safety in relation to menopausal health in women, the EFSA in 2015 found no effects on endometrial thickness and no histopathological uterine changes considering intakes of up to 150 mg soy isoflavones per day for up to 30 months. Additionally, the EFSA found no support for the hypothesis that isoflavone supplementation increases the risk for breast cancer or alters mammographic density or thyroid hormone levels. The EFSA concluded that dosages of soy isoflavones used in intervention studies (ranging from around 40 to 100 mg isoflavones daily) could guide consumers as to daily supplementation levels.289 Recent clinical and preclinical studies suggest that isoflavones can influence the production and regulation of thyroid hormones both positively and negatively.290–295 Although not frequently seen in humans, it is important to respect the potential for high soy intake to precipitate or exacerbate thyroid dysfunction, especially among women, children, and iodine-deficient individuals. In those with low-iodine status, soy products may increase TSH levels, and TSH may need to be monitored. A 2006 review of 14 clinical trials concluded that in euthyroid individuals receiving sufficient iodine, there was no evi- dence that isoflavones affect thyroid function.296 Women experiencing early menopause and given 15 g soy protein with 66 mg isoflavones showed significant increases in TSH as well as a reduction in free thy- roxine levels, although no hypothyroid symptoms or changes in free T3 levels were seen.297 High soy intake may lower parathyroid hor- mone levels in postmenopausal women.298

# DRUG–NUTRIENT INTERACTIONS

Soy in various forms has been reported to interact with several types of drugs, and some soy constituents’ mechanisms of action may have additive effects with some drugs. Soy may have additive effects with antidiabetic drugs and may increase the risk for hypoglycemia, and drug dosages may need to be adjusted. Soy protein may have additive effects with hypotensive drugs and may increase the risk for hypoten- sion, and drug dosages may need to be adjusted. Soy products may competitively inhibit estrogens and may have additive effects with antiestrogenic drugs, and drug dosages may need to be adjusted. Some

soy products may inhibit platelet aggregation and may interact with blood clotting agents; blood clotting function may need to be mon- itored and drug dosages adjusted.299 Soy protein may decrease the absorption of oral levothyroxine, and these substances should be used at separate times.300 Those with cancer or other hormone-sensitive health conditions should discuss soy with their physicians because soy components may interact with hormone therapies. Very high intake of soy may increase the risk of bladder cancer. Women testing positive for HBV or HCV may be advised to avoid isoflavone supplementation.

## Cadmium Content

Chronic, low-level cadmium exposure has been associated with an increased risk of several conditions, including osteoporosis, kidney damage, hypertension, insulin resistance, cancer, diabetes, uterine fibroids, and increased rates of miscarriage. A study from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, dis- covered that the greatest dietary contributor of cadmium was tofu.69 This study included several other food sources of soy, such as tem- peh, tofu hot dogs, tofu cheese, and soy burgers. The data revealed that once-weekly consumption of tofu increased urinary cadmium by 0.11 μ g/g, only 0.02 μ g/g less than the increase attributed to smoking. In women who ingested any of the listed tofu products twice weekly or more, the urinary cadmium burden increased by 0.30 μ g/g, more than twice the increase found from smoking. Presumably (the research is inconsistent) this was due to the soy being grown conventionally with high-phosphate fertilizers that are commonly contaminated with cadmium. Those consuming soy foods are recommended to select soy products from organically grown soybeans or products that have been shown to have no cadmium contamination.


From early interest in soy as an alternative protein source to curiosity about whether or not one can be converted into a producer of benefi- cial soy metabolites, studies conducted in humans, animals, test tubes, and in silico are increasingly reassuring about soy’s benefits for most populations while also clarifying the characteristics of individuals who may be at risk for its uncommon hazards. Science is additionally seek- ing ways to increase soy foods’ palatability as well as the bioavailability of their isoflavones.301 Unlocking the benefits of soy foods is relatively easy for the major- ity with no sensitivity to soy: enjoy more of the broad variety of food choices, from creamy yuba (skimmed from tofu-making) and fer- mented soy milk to high-fiber soy hulls and chewy texturized vegeta- ble protein used in meat-mimicking foods and snacks. Longtime soy researcher Mark Messina has recommended the following optimal intakes for soy and its components for women: 15 to 20 g soy protein (more if cholesterol reduction is the goal) and 50 to 90 mg soy isofla- vones daily,302 which corresponds to a few servings of soy foods.

## 869CHAPTER 115 Tabebuia avellanedae (syn. T. impetiginosa, Lapacho, Pau d’Arco, Ipe Roxo)

• Cancers of the esophagus, head, intestine, lung, prostate, and tongue Lapacho is reported to be alexiteric, analgesic, anodyne, antidotal, antimicrobial, diuretic, and fungicidal.2


During the 19th century, lapacho was subjected to scientific scrutiny, with the first active constituent, lapachol, isolated by Paterno in (Fig. 115.1 and Fig 115.2). Interestingly, many of the scientific studies have found lapacho and lapachol to be more effective in treating malaria and cancerous tumors through oral ingestion rather than intravenous or intramus- cular injection.6 An herbalist’s interpretation would be that the body’s recuperative powers are more effectively stimulated by the natural route of nutrient plant material absorption through the digestive tract. Although most of the studies have been of individual chemicals, some show signifi- cantly better results with the whole extract and diminishing effective- ness as the extracts are refined or individual chemicals are tested.6,7

## Antimicrobial Activity

## Antibacterial Activity

Lapachol isolated from the T. avellanedae tree has exhibited antimicro- bial activity against gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria and Brucella species as well as fungistatic behavior.8,9 It is important to note that the research team found that progressive purification reduced the antimi- crobial activity of the extract. This finding led to the conclusion that more than one active substance was present in the original extract. It was eventually found that along with lapachol, the extract of the Tabebuia tree contained α -lapachone, β -lapachone, and a newly dis- covered quinone called xyloidone. Several of the naphthoquinones1 exhibit strong microbicidal and fungicidal activities (Table 115.1). Lapachol has been shown to have both antimicrobial and antiviral activity.8,10,11 Beta-lapachone shows diversified antiparasitic activity as well as antiviral action.12,13 Alpha-lapachone is also active against certain parasites, and xyloidone is active against numerous bacteria and fungi.14,15 Another lapacho component, the flavonoid quercetin, is cytotoxic for certain parasites.16 Xyloidone is effective against a wide array of organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and the Brucella species. This component also inhibits the causative agents of tuberculosis, dysentery, and anthrax.

## Mechanism of action. Lapachol, like many naphthoquinones,

acts as a respiratory poison by interfering with electron transport in microbes.17,18 At concentrations of 100 mg/L, lapachol was found to inhibit O 2 uptake by Plasmodium knowles by 74% and succinate oxidase systems by 26% and thus to exhibit antimalarial activity.19,20 Mitochondrial respiration is inhibited by 50% at a lapachol concentration of less than μ mol/L.21 Increasing doses of lapachol produced progressive respiratory inhibition in tumor cells isolated from animals. Oxygen consumption and oxygen metabolite production are inhibited in neutrophils on the administration of lapachol.22 Lapachol has now been shown to act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Lapachol prevents the synthesis of adenosine tri- phosphate by stimulating respiration in the absence of a phosphate acceptor. This effect is most pronounced at a high pH, at which lipid solubility is the lowest.23 Lapachol inhibits certain enzymes; in particular, it is a competi- tive inhibitor of glycolase I in erythrocytes. Lapachol also demon- strates noncompetitive inhibition of α -keto-aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of toxic α -ketoaldehydes.24 Lapachol demonstrated 64% inhibition of 3- α -hydroxysteroid–mediated tran- shydrogenase at a concentration of 10–5M (well within the dosage range).25

## Antiviral Activity

Lapachol has proved to be active against certain viral strains, includ- ing herpesvirus hominis types I and II.25 Hydroxynaphthoquinone has been shown to effectively inhibit four influenza viruses. Lapachol also significantly inhibits poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus.10 Beta-lapachone’s antiviral activity has been demonstrated by its ability to inhibit certain enzymes, such as DNA and RNA poly- merases.26 Beta-lapachone was tested against avian myeloblastosis virus and Rauscho murine leukemia virus and found to inhibit ret- rovirus reverse transcriptase.27 In the presence of dithioreitol, β -lapa- chone inhibits eukaryotic DNA polymerase-alpha activity.

the mechanism of action for enzyme inhibition is complex, it may be related to superoxide production.26 This issue has great significance for possible treatment of both human immunodeficiency virus and Epstein–Barr virus (the implicated viruses in acquired immunodefi- ciency syndrome and Epstein–Barr syndrome, respectively). Beta-lapachone also inhibits Friend virus and was the only sub- stance among a number tested that prolonged the survival time of chickens infected intraperitoneally with Rous sarcoma virus.28

## Antiparasitic Activity

The trematode Schistosoma mansoni is the causative agent of the com- mon tropical disease schistosomiasis. The cercariae of this blood fluke live in water and enter the host by penetrating the skin. This debilitat- ing disease, a serious problem in many tropical areas, causes weakening of the host and increases susceptibility to a variety of other pathogens, some of which may be fatal. Lapachol has been tested as a topical barrier to the cercariae and has been found to be highly effective at preventing its penetration.26,29 Oral lapachol was also tested and found to significantly reduce penetration. After being consumed, the lapachol was secreted onto the skin, appar- ently by the sebaceous glands, where it again acted as a topical barrier. The cercariae seek to penetrate the host through or near the sebaceous glands, suggesting that dietary administration of lapachol would be an efficient means of protecting against infection. Alpha-lapachone and β -lapachone, also components of lapacho, both exhibited activ- ity against S. mansoni.8 Beta-lapachone is notably effective against Trypanosoma cruzi, a zoomastigote responsible for trypanosomiasis, or Chagas’ disease, which occurs in both acute and chronic forms and has no known cure. Beta-lapachone causes complete inhibition of T. cruzi at concen- trations of 0.8 to 5.0 μ g/mL and progressively inhibits motility with increasing concentrations. When T. cruzi epimastigotes were incu- bated with the quinone, they were subjected to nuclear, mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticular, and cytoplasmic membrane damage and under- went alterations in the chromatin distribution. Respiration rates were lowered, the mitochondria became swollen, and glucose and pyruvate oxidation was inhibited. Lipid peroxidation was stimulated, leading to decreased cell viability. In addition, in vitro testing resulted in the rapid decay of DNA, RNA, and protein as well as DNA breakage in T. cruzi. This was accom- panied by inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and the instigation of “unscheduled” DNA synthesis.30,31 It is thought that this toxic action against parasites is at least partly due to superoxide production.32 Both O 2 _ and H 2 O 2 are intermedi- ates of oxygen reduction, and both are toxic to living organisms. When β -lapachone is introduced to T. cruzi, it rapidly enters the epimastigote and is reduced to its semiquinone form in the mitochondria and mic- rosomes of the pathogen.33 Superoxide is produced by the reduction of molecular oxygen, which is facilitated by autooxidation of the semiqui- none free radical. Superoxide is then converted to hydrogen peroxide via superoxide dismutase. Stimulation of lipid peroxidation follows, and the cell degenerates.

## Antifungal Activity

In addition to its activity against a variety of bacteria, components of lapacho are known to possess potent antifungal capabilities.11,34 The quinone xyloidone inhibits several species of fungus (including Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Cryptococcus neoformans).11 The antifungal activity of aqueous, dichloromethane, and methanol extracts from T. avellanedae were also compared, and it was found that the aqueous and methanol extracts showed the highest antifungal activity.35 T. avellanedae bark was found to be active against Aspergillus fumigatus, C. neoformans, Microsporum gypseum, Penicillium purpuro- genum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.35

## Antineoplastic Effects

Because of the folklore information surrounding the tumor-reduc- ing qualities of the herb lapacho, it underwent extensive study by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). After the initial positive results, lapa- chol was judged to be the most active antineoplastic agent. Lapachol

entered Phase I clinical trials at the NCI in 1968 on the basis of its activity against Walker 256 tumors (with a confidence rate exceeding 90%). During these trials, it was difficult to obtain therapeutic blood levels of lapachol without some mild toxic side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and anti–vitamin K activity. This occurrence is quite diffi- cult to understand because later studies found the toxicity to be very low.2 The investigative new drug (IND) status for the drug was closed in 1970 due to these toxicity issues.36 It has been shown, however, that some of the anthraquinones in lapacho have vitamin K activity; therefore use of the whole herb would compensate for lapachol’s effect on vitamin K.37 The approach just described indicates a flaw in the underlying phi- losophy of the pharmaceutical sciences and the NCI program. Because the initial studies came from a whole plant, the detailed studies should have been undertaken on the whole plant. Some of the other qui- nones have also been shown to have antineoplastic activities. Was it too complex to consider the chemical reactions of the more than components found in lapacho? Or was the standard economic/political incentive for patenting an analog an impediment to the investigation of a plant species? Lapachol is rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration to rats bearing Walker 256 tumors. It is taken up by all tissues except the brain and blood cells. A significant amount appears in the tumor after 6 hours, with most of the drug disappearing from the other body tissues. The half-life of intravenous lapachol is minutes in mice (75 minutes in dogs). Lapachol is extensively metab- olized and excreted mostly in the feces.38 Beta-lapachone has been shown to inhibit the growth of a large variety of tumor cells, including epidermoid laryngeal cancer; prostate, colon, ovary, and breast can- cers; and also different types of leukemia cells.39 The theories on how lapachol works as an antineoplastic agent vary considerably. One of the most prominent involves reduction-oxidation (redox) cycle capabilities. Lapachol was found to be an in vivo inhibitor of respiration at chemotherapeutic doses.5 Later, lapachol was shown to augment the flow of electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate to form oxygen-related free radicals. These seem to be site-specific free radicals that bind to the cancerous DNA or RNA, producing either superoxides or free hydroxyl radicals.40,41 There seems to be a redox potential that is important for the inhibi- tion of electron transfer in coenzyme Q 10 .42 Bennett et al.43 argued that this respiration poisoning is not the mechanism of antitumor activity. In their study, lapachol was shown to significantly reduce the pool of uridine triphosphate, the largest pool of the pyrimidine nucleotides (exposure time was very short, 2–4 hours). Lapachol is theorized to be like dichloroallyl lawsone in that it blocks pyrimidine biosynthesis through inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.17 It is also believed that the antineoplastic activities of lapachol might stem from its interaction with nucleic acids,41 and it has been proposed that interaction of the naphthoquinone moiety between base pairs of the DNA helix occurs with subsequent inhibition of DNA replication and/or RNA synthesis. Free amino groups in the sugar moiety are necessary for DNA binding.44 Beta-lapachone has an effect on the modulation of cell growth and apoptosis in human colon carcinoma tumor (HCT-116) cell lines. Exposure of HCT-116 cells to β -lapachone resulted in growth inhi- bition and induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The researchers suggest therefore that β -lapachone–induced apoptosis may be partly regulated through the inactivation of the second messenger nuclear factor (NF)- κβ system.45 Beta-lapachone was also shown to decrease the viability of sarcoma cells by stimulating lipid peroxidation. This was accomplished through the following activities32: • Reduction of lapachone at the mitochondrial and microsomal membranes with the generation of the semiquinone form • Autooxidation to produce O 2 • Production of H 2 O 2 via superoxide dismutase More than one mechanism has been shown to underlie the anti- neoplastic effect.7 There is ongoing positive research on cancers of the liver,46,47 bladder,48 prostate,49,50 lung,51 colon,45 and breast (estrogen receptor site inhibition).52

## Anti-Inflammatory Activity

Extracts of the bark from T. avellanedae demonstrate clear anti- inflammatory activity with low toxicity.53 Pau d’arco douching and the use of tampons soaked in an alcoholic extract of lapacho have been shown to be very successful against a wide range of inflamma- tions, such as vaginitis, cervicitis, and cervicovaginitis.1,27,34 An aqueous extract of the inner bark of T. avellanedae has demon- strated antinociceptive and antiedematogenic activities in mouse models, with a possible antinociceptive effect correlated with the adenosine system.54 Adenosine itself is posited to interact with recep- tors coupled with G protein for this effect.53,55 Two animal studies using carrageenan-induced subplantar edema have also exhibited the anti-inflammatory abilities of lapachol.54,56 In one study, the second phase of inflammation, which is correlated with the appearance of prostaglandins and kinins, was where lapachol seemed to exert the greatest anti-inflammatory effect.56 Lapacho compounds have also demonstrated potent activity against the growth of human kerati- nocytes and appear to be promising as effective antipsoriatic agents; β -lapachone displayed activity comparable with that of the antipso- riatic drug anthralin. It has been shown that the decoction similar to ethnobotanical use suppresses PGE 2 .57 Beta-lapachone has been found effective in wound healing by inducing cell proliferation, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.58

## Other Studied Actions

T. avellanedae has been investigated as a possible antidepressant59 and is also active against ulcers (as well as Heliobacter pylori),60,61 immune modulation,62 platelet aggregation,63 and antioxidant volatile fractions.64

## Quercetin

Quercetin is a highly active flavonoid that inhibits a wide range of enzymes and suppresses the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins.65 Quercetin’s cytotoxicity may be due to the fact that it inhibits mito- chondrial electron transport.66 Hodnick et al.66 have noted that quer- cetin produced a substrate-independent potassium cyanide–insensitive respiratory burst in mitochondria. Other flavonoids that have demon- strated this activity produced O 2 _ and H 2 O 2 , suggesting that quercetin may also generate these cytotoxic chemicals. The following are among the enzymes inhibited by quercetin30,32,67: • Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase • Phosphodiesterase • Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–independent protein kinases • Ca2+ phospholipid–dependent protein kinase • Tyrosine-protein kinases Shapiro et al.16 suggested that the cytotoxicity of quercetin may be due to its chelating abilities. This agent is trypanocidal to Trypanosoma brucei, a livestock parasite belonging to the same genus as T. cruzi. Soon after the parasite enters the host, the host’s unsaturated iron-building proteins remove iron from the hemoflagellate. Because the parasite is unable to synthesize heme, it encounters a shortage of iron. By chelat- ing the host’s iron, quercetin blocks utilization of iron by the parasite

## 872SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

yet does not adversely affect the host. This flavonoid is also cytotoxic against Crithidia fasciculata. The fact that quercetin is small and litho- philic seems to be important to its activity. Like lapachol, quercetin inhibited O 2 consumption and H 2 O 2 pro- duction in neutrophils.68 Many flavonoids exhibit antiviral activity. When mice that had been intracerebrally infected with attenuated viruses, including rabies, were given quercetin in their diet, a prophy- lactic effect was observed.69 Quercetin inactivates the following viruses (inactivation is defined as reducing viral infectivity tenfold): • Herpes simplex type • Respiratory syncytial virus • Pseudorabies/Aujeszky’s virus • Poliovirus type • Parainfluenza type • Sindbis virus • Potato virus x


The spectrum of clinical applications of T. avellanedae is quite broad. Current use has focused on lapacho’s antineoplastic and antimicrobial activity. Its use is extremely popular in the treatment (both topical and internal) of intestinal candidiasis and vaginal candidiasis. Research has also focused on antipsoriatic and antiedema properties. There are also many anecdotal reports of remission of different forms of cancer with the use of this botanical.68 Unfortunately, because of the lack of quality control and confusion about the portion of the plant to use, it is highly likely that many prac- titioners are not using effective materials. This likelihood could explain varying clinical results.


Only one recent clinical study appears to be indexed in PubMed. In this Phase II trial, T. avellanedae was used an adjunct to conventional cancer treatment. It was shown to be safe and effective in preventing and/or reducing oral mucositis during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.70


The usual form of administration of lapacho is as a decoction, with the standard dose being 1 cup of decocted bark two to eight times per day. The decoction is made by boiling 1 teaspoon of lapacho for each cup of water for 5 to 15 minutes. A more precise dosage based on a lapachol content of 2% to 4% would be 15 to 20 g of bark boiled in 500 mL or 1 pint of water for 5 to 15 minutes three to four times daily. Dosages of other forms (aqueous extract, fluid extract, solid extract) should be based on lapachol content, providing a daily lapachol intake of 1.5 to 2 g/day. A tampon that has been soaked in the decoction or fluid extract is used in the treatment of vaginitis and cervicitis. The tampon is inserted vaginally and changed every 24 hours until resolution.


Although anti–vitamin K activity has been reported for lapachol, the presence of several vitamin K–like substances in the whole plant sug- gests that this is not a problem. Long-term administration of lapachol at a dose of 0.0625 to 0.25 g/kg per day to monkeys was found to produce moderate to severe anemia. The anemia was most pronounced during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Death occurred in monkeys after six doses of lapachol at 0.5 g/kg per day and after five doses of 1 g/kg per day.6 There have been no reports in the literature of human toxicity when the whole bark is used as a decoction. Long-term use of large doses of the decoction by indigenous peoples has shown no adverse reactions. Because low doses have been reported to cause nausea and vomiting,71 only a qualified naturopathic physician, herbalist, or other practitioner experienced in its use should attempt to use this botanical medicine.


No interactions with pharmaceutical drugs have been reported, but because of its known anti–vitamin K–like activity, there may be an interaction with anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin, that could theoretically result in increased bleeding tendencies. This effect would probably be minimized if treatment involved the whole herb rather than specific components. In any case, caution is warranted.

Feverfew has been used for centuries to relieve fever, migraines, and arthritis. The only condition with confirmed scientific documentation at present is in the prevention and treatment of migraine headache.

# MIGRAINE HEADACHE

Physician John Hill, in his book The Family Herbal (1772), noted, “In the worst headache this herb exceeds whatever else is known.” A survey found that 70% of 270 migraine sufferers who had eaten fever- few daily for prolonged periods claimed that the herb decreased the frequency and/or intensity of their attacks.17 Many of these patients had shown no response to orthodox medicines. Numerous double-blind trials have been conducted on the effi- cacy of feverfew in patients with migraine,17–22 the results of which have been assessed in three meta-analyses.23–25 The first two of these concluded that the majority of studies show that feverfew extracts are superior to placebo for decreasing the frequency and severity of migraine headaches, although most of the studies were of relatively CBA Fig. 116.2 Feverfew whole plant (A), flower (B), and feathery leaves (C).

The color figures will appear in color in all electronic versions of this book. low methodological quality, and efficacy was not proved beyond a rea- sonable doubt.21,24 The third meta-analysis concluded that feverfew extracts have not been proved in controlled trials to prevent migraine better than placebo.25 The highest-quality study among feverfew clinical trials used a granulated ethanol extract of feverfew and found it ineffective com- pared with placebo, whereas all the other trials used unextracted pow- dered feverfew. As a result, careful attention must be paid in future studies to the types of products used, and the results of trials using different products should probably not be combined in meta-analyses. One double-blind, randomized clinical trial compared the effects of a combination of a feverfew extract (100 mg) with riboflavin 400 mg and magnesium 300 mg taken daily with riboflavin 25 mg.26 The control, riboflavin 25 mg, appeared to be just as active as the com- bination formula, and the trial showed that combining feverfew and magnesium with riboflavin adds no additional benefits for preventing migraine headaches. In an open trial, feverfew combined with Salix alba (white willow) extracts, 300 mg of each twice a day, has been shown effective at pre- venting and reducing the severity of migraine without aura.27 A com- bination of homeopathic dilutions of Zingiber officinale (ginger) and feverfew was effective in one open and one double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for relieving acute migraine pain.28,29 It is not known if either homeopathic is superior to feverfew alone or how they would compare with botanical extracts in a head-to-head comparative trial.

# RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

Inflammatory compounds released by white blood cells and platelets contribute greatly to the inflammation and cellular damage found in rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of the release of inflammatory par- ticles by feverfew is much greater than that achieved by NSAIDs like aspirin.10 This finding, coupled with many of feverfew’s other effects, indicates that feverfew can reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Although a double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated no apparent benefit from oral feverfew in rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage used was small (76 mg dried powdered feverfew leaf, cor- responding to two medium-sized leaves), the level of parthenolide was not determined in the product, and patients continued to take NSAIDs, a practice that has been suggested to reduce the efficacy of feverfew.30 Therefore the benefit of feverfew in rheumatoid arthritis has not yet been determined.


The effectiveness of feverfew was thought to depend on adequate levels of parthenolide, although multiple studies confirm that there are mul- tiple active compounds in feverfew and that parthenolide-free extracts are still active.31,32 It is difficult to determine the relevance of measur- ing parthenolide in extracts; assessments of activity of extracts would perhaps be superior, although more expensive. The preparations used in some successful clinical trials had a par- thenolide content of 0.4% to 0.66%. The dosage of feverfew used in the London Migraine Clinic study was one capsule containing 25 mg of the freeze-dried pulverized leaves given twice a day.6 In the Nottingham study it was one capsule containing 82 mg of dried powdered leaves given once a day.7 Therefore the daily dosage of parthenolide that may be effective in preventing a migraine headache is roughly 0.25 to 0.5 mg. Although these low dosages may be effective in preventing an attack, a higher dose (1–2 g) is necessary during an acute attack: dried pulverized leaves 25 to 50 mg given twice a day.


There were no reports of toxic reactions in patients taking feverfew in the 6-month migraine study. Feverfew has been used by large num- bers of people for many years without reports of toxicity. Chewing the leaves, however, may result in aphthous ulcerations, and some sen- sitive persons experience an exudative dermatitis from external con- tact.33 In clinical trials, neither mouth ulcers nor dermatitis was more common in the feverfew groups than the placebo groups; in one trial, aphthous ulcers were actually more common in the placebo group.19


Because feverfew affects the activity of several of the CYP liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism, a number of interactions are theoreti- cally possible.

in the flower tissue. Three hydroxycinnamic acids—chicoric acid, monocaffeyltartaric acid, and chlorogenic acid—have been found throughout the plant, and the coumarins cichoriin and aesculin have been identified in leaf extracts. Chicoric acid and the related mono- caffeyltartaric acid were found to be the major phenolic constituents in dandelion flowers, roots, leaves, and involucral bracts and also in the medicinal preparations tested.5

# HISTORY AND FOLK USE

Although many individuals may consider the common dandelion an unwanted weed, herbalists all over the world have revered this valuable herb. Generally regarded as a liver remedy, dandelion has a long his- tory of folk use throughout the world. In Europe, dandelion has been used in the treatment of the following conditions: • Fevers • Boils • Eye problems • Diarrhea • Fluid retention • Liver congestion • Heartburn • Various skin problems In China, dandelion has been used to treat the following disorders: • Breast problems (cancer, inflammation, lack of milk flow, etc.) • Liver diseases • Appendicitis • Digestive ailments Dandelion’s use in India, Russia, and most other parts of the world has revolved primarily around its action on the liver.


The primary pharmacological actions of dandelion relate to digestion, liver function, and diuresis.

## Digestive Effects

Bitter herbs like dandelion are used to aid digestion on the basis of the belief that bitter principles stimulate the initial phase of digestion, including the secretion of salivary and gastric juices. Dandelion goes beyond this initial phase by stimulating the release of bile by the liver and gallbladder. The digestive tonic properties attributed to dandelion are now believed to be due to a bitter principle researchers have named tarax- acin and have identified as belonging to a class of active substances called guaianolides, which have intestinal antiseptic, germicidal, and expectorant effects.6 Dandelion root contains a very high concentration (up to 40%) of inulin, which serves as a food source for the “friendly” colonic bacte- ria species Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and thus promotes their growth. Aqueous root extracts of Taraxacum officinale were tested for their activity in stimulating the growth of 14 different strains of bifidobacteria. The growth of six strains (B. adolescentis 1 and 2, B. bif- idum 1, B. catenulatum, and B. longum 2) was significantly enhanced; two strains were slightly enhanced, whereas the remaining six strains exhibited no enhancement.7

## Blood Sugar Control

A number of components in dandelion have demonstrated antidia- betic effects.8 Foremost are inulin and taxasterol, but also the sesquit- erpene lactones, phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Inulin is also helpful in improving blood sugar control and diabetes.9 Studies on dandelion extracts showed an ability to stimulate the release of insulin in pancreatic β -cells as well as improve blood sugar control in a num- ber of different animal models.8

## Liver Tonic

Studies in humans and laboratory animals have shown that dande- lion root enhances the flow of bile, improving such conditions as liver congestion, bile duct inflammation, hepatitis, gallstones, and jaundice.1,2,10,11 Dandelion’s action in increasing bile flow is twofold: it has a direct effect on the liver, causing rises in bile production and flow to the gallbladder (choleretic effect), and a direct effect on the gallbladder, causing its contraction and the release of stored bile (cholagogue effect). The high choline content of the root may be a major factor in dandelion’s ability to act as a “tonic” to the liver. Historically, dandelion’s positive effect on such a wide variety of conditions is probably closely related to its ability to improve liver function. In one animal study, dandelion significantly improved the liv- er’s ability to clear toxins by 244%. Dandelion’s effectiveness in improving the liver’s ability to clear potentially toxic agents was also demonstrated in a study in which rats were given the antimi- crobial drug ciprofloxacin (Cipro). In those rats that also received dandelion, levels of the drug were rapidly and significantly lowered by 73% compared with the rats that did not receive the dandelion.12 Several studies have shown that the aqueous extract of T. officinale root has protective action against alcohol or chemically induced toxicity in the liver by elevating antioxidative potentials and decreasing lipid peroxidation.13,14 In carbon tetrachloride–induced liver fibrosis, Taraxacum extract also inactivated the hepatic stel- late cells responsible for fibrosis and enhanced hepatic regenerative capabilities.15,16 O H H H H

## Diuretic and Weight Loss Effects

The leaves of dandelion have confirmed diuretic activity. In one study in mice, dandelion exerted a diuretic effect comparable with that of furosemide (Lasix).17 Because dandelion replaces potassium lost through diuresis, it does not have the potential side effects of furose- mide, such as hepatic coma and circulatory collapse. The dose given was 8 mL/kg body weight of the aqueous fluid extract of the leaves. This dose produced a 30% loss of body weight in mice and rats in a 30-day period. Much of the weight loss was attributed to the significant diuretic effect.

## Anticancer and Immune-Enhancing Effects

Various dandelion extracts and components have demonstrated anti- tumor properties in animal experiments.18–20 Evidence also indicates that dandelion enhances cell-mediated, humoral, and nonspecific immunity; induces the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and influences the production of nitric oxide.21,22 In one study, three aque- ous extracts were prepared from the mature leaves, flowers, and roots and tested for their effects on tumor progression–related processes such as proliferation and invasion.23 Dandelion leaf extract decreased the growth of breast cancer cells, whereas the aqueous extracts of dan- delion flower and root had no effect on such growth. Dandelion root extract was found to block the invasion of breast cancer cells, and the leaf extract blocked the invasion of prostate cancer cells.


Dandelion’s specific action is on the liver, but as an alterative or tonic, it benefits the body as a whole. It is often used as follows: • As a diuretic • As a laxative • As a cholagogue • As a general stimulant for the urinary system • As a choleretic • As a depurative (purifier) • As a hypoglycemic agent • As an antitumor agent Two human studies have demonstrated the liver-healing proper- ties of dandelion. In a 1938 study in Italy, 12 patients with severe liver imbalances—many exhibiting classic symptoms such as loss of appe- tite, low energy, and jaundice—were treated with dandelion extract (one 5-mL injection daily for 20 days).1 Of the 12 patients, 11 showed a considerable drop in blood cholesterol. In the other study, dandelion extract was shown to successfully treat hepatitis, swelling of the liver, jaundice, and dyspepsia with deficient bile secretion.9 In a pilot study to assess its diuretic activity in humans, dandelion leaf extract at a dosage of 8 mL three times a day produced a significant increase in the frequency of urination in the 5-hour period after the first dose, a significant increase in the excretion ratio in the 5-hour period after the second dose, and no effect after the third dose.24 These results indicate that dandelion produces an acute diuretic effect.


As a general tonic and mild liver remedy, dandelion root can be used at the following dosages three times per day: • Dried root: 2 to 8 g by infusion or decoction • Fluid extract (1:1): 4 to 8 mL (1–2 tsp) • Tincture: Alcohol-based tinctures of dandelion are not recom- mended because of the extremely high dosage required. • Juice of fresh root: 4 to 8 mL (1–2 tsp) • Powdered solid extract (4:1): 250 to 500 mg Preparations of the leaves can be used as a mild diuretic and weight- loss agent at the following dosages three times a day: • Dried leaf: 4 to 10 g by infusion • Fluid extract (1:1): 4 to 8 mL (1–2 tsp)


No toxic or adverse effects have been reported for either the exter- nal or internal use of dandelion. It is considered safe to use even in large amounts, with virtually no documented side effects.1 There has been one case report of an atopic individual experiencing an anaphylactic reaction after the oral ingestion of an herbal combi- nation containing T. officinale. In this case the herbal compound was found to have trace amounts of pollen from T. officinale and several other medicinal plants, which resulted in this systemic reac- tion.25 This single case report indicates a possible need for caution in individuals with pollen allergy to other plants of the Compositae family. The carcinogenicity of T. officinale has been investigated in an ani- mal model. No carcinogenic activity was observed after 120 days of administration.26


In an animal study, administration of an extract of the whole dande- lion plant concomitantly with ciprofloxacin decreased absorption of the drug.27 The investigators found that this effect was due to the high mineral content of the dandelion herb. Until further information is available, ciprofloxacin should not be taken within 2 hours of any dan- delion supplement, including tea. In general, it is often recommended that botanical medicines hav- ing a diuretic effect be avoided by anyone taking diuretic medications because the former may enhance the effect of the latter and lead to possible cardiovascular side effects. Dandelion ingestion may increase the hypoglycemic effect of insu- lin. A single case report exists describing a 58-year-old-woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy presenting to an emergency department with a hypoglycemic episode after 2 weeks of daily inges- tion of fresh dandelion leaves in salad.28

# CHEMICAL COMPOSITION

The Pacific yew is poisonous because it contains at least 11 diterpene alkaloids, known collectively as taxines. The structure of only two of the alkaloid constituents is known: taxine A, which accounts for 30%, and taxine B, which accounts for 2%. Paclitaxel (Fig. 118.2), like all taxines, is a pseudoalkaloid because its nitrogen is a pseudoalkaloid but not a con- stituent of taxine because its nitrogen is acylated with benzoic acid and has no basic principle. The concentration of paclitaxel in yew bark is low, only 0.01%. Pacific yew needles contain a similar concentration of paclitaxel.4a

# HISTORY AND FOLK USE

Historically, the yew has been highly valued for its dense, resilient, decay-resistant, tight-grained wood and its medicinal properties. The Greeks named the yew toxus in reference to its use for making a strong bow (toxon), and its poisonous nature (toxikon).2 It was used as an animal and fish poison by primitive cultures and also for murder and suicide. In the 1st century ad, Claudius suggested its use as an antidote for viper bites. Europeans used it as an abortifacient and to treat heart ailments and hydrophobia.2 Native Americans used the yew for many ailments including the following: • Rheumatism • Lung ailments • Colds and fever • Pain and numbness • Paralysis • Scurvy • Stomachache • Bowel ailments • Dysmenorrhea • Gonorrhea Women ate yew arils to prevent conception. Youths rubbed smooth sticks of yew on their developing bodies to gain its strength. Both the bark and the leaves have been brewed for tea, and powders have been made from the bark alone. The fleshy red aril that surrounds the seed is not poisonous, although the seed itself is.5 There is a lot of folklore about the yew’s supernatural powers. Because it is a slow-growing, long-lived tree, it was associated with immortality and used in spells to raise the dead.6 Because it was regarded as among the most potent of trees for protection against evil, it was considered unlucky to cut down or damage a yew tree. Many were planted in churchyards/graveyards and alongside homes for protection. Specimens survive today despite main trunks being hol- lowed out from decay after hundreds of years of existence.


Paclitaxel’s anticancer action is unique in that it inhibits cell division by promoting the formation of microtubules, the rod-like structures that function as a cell skeleton, making cells more stable and resistant to depolymerization (Fig. 118.3). In contrast, other anticancer phyto- agents (e.g., colchicine and vinca alkaloids) induce the polymerization OO O 13 HOOH O5 4 OHOO O O H O H 3 C CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 NH OH 3’ Empirical formula: C 47 H 51 NO 14 Molecular weight: 853.9g/mol Average mass: 853.9 Da Systemic name: (2 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 13 )-4,10-Diacetoxy-13-{[(2R, 3S) -3-(benzoylamino)-2-hydroxy-3- phenylpropanoyl]oxy}-1,7- dihydroxy-9-oxo-5,20-epoxytax-11- en-2-yl benzoate α α βββ Fig. 118.2 Structure of paclitaxel.

of microtubules. In addition, under the influence of paclitaxel, the microtubules polymerize independently of the microtubule-organiz- ing center, which is in a perinuclear area, and instead localize predom- inantly in the cell’s periphery.7 This interferes with the mitotic spindle and selectively blocks cells in the G 2 and M phases of the cell cycle, the most radiosensitive phases. Additionally, paclitaxel induces the forma- tion of abnormal spindle asters that do not require centrioles for enu- cleation and are reversible after treatment.8–11 Furthermore, in vivo, paclitaxel has demonstrated an ability to activate the local release of an apoptosis-inducing cytokine.12 Studies on cancer cell lines induced with gml, a novel gene, have demonstrated a marked increase in sen- sitivity to paclitaxel via apoptosis. An assay for gml expression could serve as a clinically useful predictor of chemotherapeutic sensitivity.13


Paclitaxel has demonstrated a broad spectrum of antitumor activity. Phase I trials, begun in 1983, demonstrated paclitaxel’s antineoplastic activity against several tumor types, such as the following14–21: • Melanoma • Adenocarcinoma of unknown origin • Refractory ovarian carcinoma • Small-cell and non–small-cell lung carcinoma • Gastric, colon, prostate, breast, and head and neck carcinomas • Lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias In early studies, impressive results were seen using paclitaxel in combination with other antineoplastic agents, such as cisplatin.22 Having treated patients who were previously resistant to cisplatin with the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel, the Gynecology Oncology Group reported a 33% response rate.23 Trials were quickly conducted on a number of solid tumor types, including small-cell and non–small- cell lung, renal, gastric, breast, advanced ovarian, colon, and cervical carcinomas; head and neck cancers; small-cell prostate carcinomas; and low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.24 Paclitaxel also has activity in other malignancies that are refractory to conventional chemother- apy, including previously treated lymphoma; small-cell lung cancers; and esophageal, gastric, endometrial, bladder, and germ-cell tumors. Paclitaxel is also active against AIDS-associated Kaposi’s sarcoma. Although paclitaxel is a well-accepted treatment option for these can- cers and others, significant toxicities, such as myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy, limit the effectiveness of paclitaxel-based treat- ment regimens.25,26 These toxicities will be discussed further.


Human poisoning from the deliberate consumption of yew leaves or seeds is now rare.27 Published cases involving psychiatric patients and prisoners describe the first symptoms of intoxication as appearing hour after ingestion. The manifestations include mydriasis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and arrhythmia. Death occurs from cardiac arrest 3 to 24 hours after ingestion.28 The lethal dose in humans is approximately four or five handfuls of leaves, corresponding to needles. No specific antidote is known. Paclitaxel binds 95% to 98% with plasma proteins yet is read- ily eliminated through hepatic metabolism, biliary excretion, and/or extensive tissue binding. Total urinary excretion has been insignificant, indicating that renal clearance contributes minimally to systemic clear- ance.21,29–31 Hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP) is involved for both paclitaxel and docetaxel. However, the former is hydroxylated by CYP2C8, whereas the latter is hydroxylated by CYP3A4.32 The role of whole yew preparations in clinical practice today is uncertain. While tincture is being used empirically for cancer patients, there is no clinical research regarding efficacy or safety. Non-paclitaxel taxanes have been shown to reverse resistance to paclitaxel in cancer cells in vitro, giving an experimental basis for the potential importance of whole-plant (at very low doses) compared to using just the iso- lated constituents.31a Non-paclitaxel taxanes enhance the absorption of paclitaxel experimentally, another reason to research whole plant extracts for clinical use.31b Toxicity manifests as follows: • Bone marrow suppression • Hypersensitivity • Cardiovascular abnormalities • Neurotoxicity • Arthralgias and myalgias • Alopecia • Gastrointestinal upset Junctional tachycardia via conduction block rather than direct pri- mary toxicity on myocytes has been suggested.33 Hypersensitivity, skin reactions, and accumulated fluid retention syndrome are minimized with a 3- to 5-day regimen of corticosteroids before paclitaxel infusion.34 Patients with leukemia who are treated with high doses of paclitaxel exhibited mucositis, which has also appeared in response to lower, cumulative dosing. An accumulation of epidermal cells with abnormal paclitaxel-induced spindle asters has been evident in ulcerated mucosa, indicating that the cell cycle was arrested in mitosis.35 Paclitaxel has been known to inhibit neurite growth and induce prominent morphological effects, such as microtubule bundles in neurons, satellite cells, and Schwann cells in organotypic dorsal root ganglion cultures.35–41 Clinically, the most common symptoms have been glove-and-stocking paresthesias and perioral numbness. Distal sensory loss to large-fiber (proprioception, vibration) and small-fiber (pinprick, temperature) modalities and loss or decrease of distal deep tendon reflexes have been noted, although motor nerves seem to be spared. In general, the clinical incidence and severity of peripheral neu- rotoxicity have been dose-related. Patients with a history of substantial alcohol use have appeared to be more predisposed to the development of the neurosensory toxic effects of cisplatin and paclitaxel.14–17,42–44 The development of a suitable clinical formulation has been ham- pered by paclitaxel’s poor aqueous solubility. Cremophor is being used as the vehicle for administration and has been implicated in side effects, such as type 1 hypersensitivity reactions.45 Neutropenia, the principal dose-limiting toxic effect of paclitaxel, resolves rapidly (in 15–21 days) after treatment is stopped.42 The major clinical risk factor for neutropenia seems to be the extent of prior myelotoxic chemotherapy and/or irradiation. Bradyarrhythmias, which have been noted as transient and asymp- tomatic, have been reported during paclitaxel infusion in at least 29% of patients with ovarian cancer.42 This development appears to be related more to paclitaxel because other agents formulated with Cremophor have not been associated with similar arrhythmias. Atypical chest pains during paclitaxel infusion have been observed, but they are believed to be a manifestation of a hypersensitivity reaction.27,43 Other paclitaxel- or Cremophor-related side effects are sudden and complete alopecia, often occurring in a single day; local venous toxic effects such as erythema, tenderness, and cellulitis in areas of dermal extravasa- tion; and fatigue, headaches, taste perversions, significant elevations in serum triglycerides, and minor rises in hepatic and renal function values.21 Medical problems that may affect the use of paclitaxel are listed in Box 118.2. Studies in rats and rabbits have shown that paclitaxel causes miscarriages and fetal deaths. Breastfeeding is contraindicated during paclitaxel therapy. Paclitaxel bound to albumin rather than using a sol- vent results in fewer and less severe side effects, with much-reduced allergic reactions.46

There are conflicting reports regarding drug interactions of Taxus brevifolia. Considering paclitaxel is metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, administration with other drugs can alter metabolism depending on the target molecule, schedule, and sequence of administration. The pharmaceutical drug, Taxol, interacts with more than 200 differ- ent medications. Because of enhanced toxicity, paclitaxel should be administered 24 hours after other chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin and epirubicin.47 Vaccinations that include live viruses are contraindicated because the risk of disseminated infection is increased, resulting from the immunosuppressive effects of paclitaxel. Box 118.1 includes a list of medications that should also be avoided with concurrent use of paclitaxel.

immunomodulating, and antioxidant effects of stinging nettle leaves help explain how they could be helpful for so many inflammatory diseases. A continuous intravenous infusion of an aqueous stinging net- tle leaf extract increased natriuresis and urine volume in rats, lead- ing to a reduction in blood pressure.13 In a small uncontrolled trial of patients with congestive heart failure, stinging nettle leaf juice showed a diuretic effect.14 Although much more work is needed, existing data support the traditional belief that stinging nettle leaves are a mild diuretic. An extract combining stinging nettle root and Prunus africanum (pygeum) bark weakly inhibited 5- α -reductase and moderately inhibited aromatase in prostate tissue.15 A separate study found that stinging nettle root extract inhibited aromatase in vitro, although much less potently than Serenoa repens (saw palmetto) extract.16 The two combined showed some additive effects. No effect was noted for another stinging nettle root extract on prostatic α1 -ad- renergic receptors.17 A double-blind placebo-controlled trial confirms that stinging nettle root extracts inhibit or reduce sex hormone–binding globu- lin (SHBG) levels in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).18 In vitro, ethanolic extracts were shown to decrease the binding of dihy- drotestosterone by SHBG.19,20 Lignans and trihydroxyoctadecenoic acids but not triterpenoids were active in this study. Stinging nettle root extracts have also been repeatedly shown to interfere with the binding of epidermal growth factor, a major stimulus of BPH, to its receptor on prostate cells.4,21 Lectins appeared to be the most active compounds isolated in these studies.


The major uses of stinging nettle, organized according to the part being used and the route of administration, are shown in Table 119.1.22

## Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Extracts of stinging nettle root have been the subject of several clini- cal trials showing its benefit for the symptoms of BPH (Table 119.2). Many of these are small, older, short trials, although longer, modern trials have also been conducted, and all show at least some benefit over placebo. The three most rigorous trials are reviewed in more depth here. In one double-blind trial, 50 men with stage I or II (mild to mod- erate) BPH symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either pla- cebo or 300 mg of an extract of stinging nettle root standardized to an unspecified amount of an unspecified steroid glycoside twice a day.23 SHBG levels were significantly lower and urine volume and maximum flow (but not average flow) significantly higher in the stinging nettle group than in the placebo group. Residual urine volume rose slightly and nonsignificantly in both groups. No adverse effects were reported. The most rigorous trial to date was a 1-year trial involving 246 men in which 459 mg of a stinging nettle root extract was significantly more effective than placebo at improving BPH symptoms.24 Urine flow and residual volume were minimally affected, with no statistical difference between the nettle extract and placebo. Adverse effect rates did not dif- fer between the treatment groups. In a large double-blind trial, 558 men with BPH were randomized to take either 120 mg of a 20:1 diethyl ether extract in 18 drops of liquid three times a day or placebo for 1 year.25 Symptoms, maximum flow rate, and postvoid residual urine amounts improved significantly in the nettle group compared with placebo. There was also a small decrease in prostate volume (approximately 3 mL) versus none in the placebo group, a significant difference. There were no adverse effects in either group. No clinical trial has compared nettle root alone with available drugs for the treatment of BPH, although combination studies have done so. Stinging nettle combined with saw palmetto was as effective as finas- teride (Proscar) and had significantly fewer adverse effects in a dou- ble-blind trial.26 This trial ran for 1 year and involved 543 men with symptomatic BPH. An uncontrolled postmarketing study that moni- tored 2080 patients with mildly symptomatic BPH who took the same saw palmetto and stinging nettle extract documented only 15 mild adverse events.27 The extract combination was very helpful in relieving symptoms. Other double-blind trials confirm that a combination of saw palmetto and nettle root extracts are superior to placebo at reliev- ing the symptoms of BPH, with minimal adverse effects.28,29 In summary, these trials support the notion that stinging nettle root has some benefit in men with symptomatic BPH, although high- er-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm this benefit. It should also be noted that a combination of nettle root and saw palmetto extracts, quercetin, and curcumin along with the HO O O H 3 CO

fluoroquinolone antibiotic prulifloxacin was significantly more likely to result in resolution of chronic prostatitis symptoms than pruliflox- acin alone in one randomized trial.30 The combination group was also significantly less likely to have recurrent symptoms 6 months later. More research is needed to determine to what extent nettle root has a beneficial role in chronic prostatitis.

## Arthritis

Stinging nettle leaves have been used internally and topically to treat arthritis. An initial uncontrolled clinical trial found that 1340 mg a day of a nettle leaf extract (6.4:1–8.1:1) reduced the need for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by 50% in patients with osteoar- thritis of the knee.31 A subsequent open trial involving patients with acute exacerbations of various forms of arthritis compared the use of a standard 200-mg dose of the NSAID diclofenac (Cambia, Cataflam, Voltaren, Voltarol, Zipsor) with a subtherapeutic 50-mg dose of diclofenac combined with 50-g of freeze-dried nettle once a day for 2 weeks.32 The two groups had similar levels of improvement (no significant differences between the groups) compared with baseline on various pain rating scales. There were no serious adverse events. Double-blind trials to confirm these results are warranted. Two case studies published in 1994 heralded the first mention in the modern medical literature of topical stinging nettles as potentially effective pain relievers for patients with arthritis.33 The practitioner who noted these cases went on to publish a case series, again showing that many patients treating themselves with topical nettle stings were experiencing noticeable pain relief, allowing for reductions in NSAID dosage.34 A double-blind trial has been conducted evaluating the effects of nettles in patients with osteoarthritis of the thumb or index finger.35 The placebo chosen was Lamium album (white deadnettle) leaf, a stingless mimic of U. dioica. Each patient used the leaf of the plant he or she was being treated with once a day, applying it to three dif- ferent spots for 30 seconds each. After 1 week of treatment, there was a 5-week washout period, followed by a 1-week crossover treatment with the other plant. When patients were treated with stinging nettle, their pain and disability scores were significantly better than during deadnettle treatment. Although the use of a nonstinging placebo may have compromised this trial, it does provide support for the folk use of topical application of nettles to reduce arthritis symptoms. A similar single-blind, randomized trial using nonstinging Urtica galeopsifolia as a control did not find that stinging nettle leaves were more effective for patients with knee osteoarthritis, although treatment was considered tolerable.36 A formula combining nettle leaf extract, rose hips concentrate, and Harpagophytum procumbens/H. zeyheri (devil’s claw) was tested against placebo in a double-blind, randomized trial in patients with knee osteoarthritis.37 After 3 months, the herbal combination significantly reduced symptoms compared with the pla- cebo with minimal adverse effects.

## Diabetes Mellitus

Numerous studies have investigated the traditional use of nettle leaf for people with diabetes. A double-blind, randomized trial of 500 mg of nettle leaf extract three times a day for 3 months found that it sig- nificantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with placebo.38 It was safely combined with a range of oral hypoglycemic medications in this trial. In another double-blind, ran- domized trial, a formula combining nettle leaf, Silybum marianum (milk thistle), and Boswellia serrata (frankincense) was similarly found to improve glycemic control, while also lowering triglyceride levels, compared with placebo.39 Other double-blind trials in patients with type 2 diabetes have found that nettle leaf extracts can reduce inflam- matory markers, reduce excessive oxidation, improve blood lipid parameters, lower serum transaminases, and lower blood glucose levels significantly compared with placebo.40–42 Hypoglycemia did not occur with nettle leaf.

## Allergic Rhinitis

One double-blind trial reported on the efficacy of stinging nettle leaves for allergic rhinitis.43 A total of 69 patients with acute onset of allergic rhinitis symptoms took 600 mg of freeze-dried stinging nettle or pla- cebo at the onset of symptoms, then recorded their responses 1 hour later. The total number of doses and general responses were recorded over the remaining week. Overall assessment of the efficacy of stinging nettle was better than that of a placebo, although differences in daily symptom logs did not show a strong difference. No statistical analysis was provided. Two patients in the nettle group dropped out owing to an intensification of symptoms, but no other significant adverse effects were noted. A second double-blind, randomized trial of 40 patients found no difference between a nettle root extract and placebo for allergic rhinitis symptoms after 1 month.44 There was a significant reduction in interferon-gamma levels with nettle root over placebo, suggesting a longer or larger trial (or using a different dose or extract) might ultimately show benefit.

## Chronic Renal Failure

The seed of nettle may have the ability to nonspecifically protect neph- rons from multiple insults and thus delay the progression of chronic renal failure. Two case studies have been published, one patient having lupus nephritis and a kidney transplant and another who underwent nephrectomy for cancer and whose serum creatinine levels declined during treatment with a nettle seed tincture.45 The dosage used was mL three times a day.

## Galactagogue

An herbal tea containing nettle leaf, Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), Carum carvi (caraway), Pimpinella anisum (anise), Foeniculum vul- gare (fennel), Galega officinalis (goat’s rue), and Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) was compared with a tea containing hibiscus and rose hips or supportive measures only in 95 women with preterm infants in a randomized open trial.46 Breast milk production increased by 80% with the herbal tea, compared with 30% to 34% in the con- trol groups. Infant weight gain did not vary between groups because mothers who were not able to produce enough milk supplemented with formula.


Stinging nettle leaf and root are available in several dosage forms, as summarized in Table 119.3. Fresh leaves are applied one to two times a day to every few days depending on symptoms, so treatment obviously requires ongoing access to growing plants.


Oral use of stinging nettle leaf, fruit, or root is not associated with any significant adverse effects. Topical application of fresh leaf raises mildly painful, inflamed wheals because of the stinging hairs. As pre- viously noted, this effect is sometimes exploited therapeutically. The welts usually clear completely within 2 hours, with lessening of symp- toms after 30 minutes. As with all herbal medicines, it is possible for patients to be allergic to stinging nettle, although this reaction is exceedingly rare.


There are no documented negative interactions between stinging net- tle and any other medication. Some open trials (described previously) suggest that stinging nettle leaves potentiate NSAIDs, allowing for dose reductions of these agents.

## Urinary Tract Infections

Uva ursi is reported to be especially active against E. coli.6 As well as exerting direct antibiotic effects, uva ursi extract promotes the aggre- gation of E. coli in vitro.9 These combined effects indicate that uva ursi can be used both in the immediate treatment and in the preven- tion of recurrent cystitis. In one double-blind study, the prophylactic effects of a standardized uva ursi extract and a placebo on recurrent cystitis were evaluated in 57 women.13 At the end of 1 year, 5 of women in the placebo group had a recurrence, whereas none of the women receiving uva ursi extract had a recurrence. No side effects were reported in either group. These impressive results indicate that regular use of uva ursi is a safe and effective measure to prevent recurrent cys- titis. In a study of normal subjects, consuming uva ursi tea was shown to have bacteriostatic effects greater than normal urine.6 The effective- ness of the tea in inhibiting bacterial growth (S. aureus and E. coli) depended on adequate excretion products of arbutin (hydroquinone paired with glucuronate or sulfur) and a pH above 8. Alkalinization of the urine with bicarbonate or citrate salts in conjunction with uva ursi may enhance the therapeutic effects in acute urinary tract infections.

# DOSAGES

The dosages for uva ursi are as follows: • Dried leaves or as an infusion: 1.5 to 4.0 g (1–2 tsp) three times daily • Freeze-dried leaves: 500 to 1000 mg three times daily • Tincture (1:5): 4 to 68 mL (1–2 tsp) three times daily • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (1/2–1 tsp) three times daily • Powdered solid extract (10% arbutin): 250 to 500 mg three times daily


The toxicological concern with uva ursi is related to the conversion of arbutin to hydroquinone, but toxicity is extremely unlikely with the consumption of commercial preparations.7,14 In the most recent evaluation, uva ursi was judged to be very safe in the treatment of uri- nary tract infections.15 Hydroquinone is metabolized in the liver by Phase II enzymes into hydroquinone glucuronate or sulfate and then excreted in the urine. At therapeutic levels of uva ursi leaf extract, the high range may provide 420 mg hydroquinone derivatives calculated as anhydrous arbutin. The calculation is that which would liberate free hydroquinone in the urine at a maximum exposure level of μ g/kg body weight. In contrast, in various laboratory animals, the oral LD 50 of hydroquinone in 2% aqueous solution is between 320 and 550 mg/ kg body weight. Signs and symptoms of uva ursi toxicity include the following: • Tinnitus • Nausea • Vomiting • Sense of suffocation • Shortness of breath • Cyanosis • Convulsions • Delirium • Collapse The only significant side effect reported in the medical literature with uva ursi consumption was that of a 56-year-old woman who ingested uva ursi for 3 years and presented with vision loss.16 Diagnosis indicated bilateral bull’s-eye maculopathy, presumably due to inhibi- tion of retinal melanin synthesis. This report raises the question of the appropriateness of long-term therapy with uva ursi. OH OH OH HO HO O O

An extract of uva ursi has been found to markedly potentiate the effects of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as oxacillin (Bactocil) and cefmetazole (Zefazone), against methicillin-resistant S. aureus.17 The effective com- pound was identified as the polyphenol corilagin. Corilagin reduced the mean inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various beta-lactams 100- to 2000-fold but not the MICs of other antimicrobial agents tested. The effect of corilagin and oxacillin was synergistic. Corilagin showed a bactericidal action when added to the growth medium in combination with oxacillin.18

clinically, the concentration of hippuric acid in cranberry does not routinely reach levels adequate for antibacterial action. Further research failed to validate the proposed theory that cranberry reduced urinary pH. Cranberry continued to be a popular remedy for urinary health, and only in the past decade has its true mechanism of action been elucidated. Current evidence is strongest for its effectiveness in promoting urinary tract health and reducing the risk of UTIs while sparing the patient the experience of unwanted side effects and the con- tinued use of prophylactic low-dose prescription drugs.25


The primary application of cranberry is in the prevention of UTIs. Cranberry components interfere with bacterial adherence to mucosal cells—an important step in the development of infection. For bac- teria to successfully attach to the host, they must identify and attach to epithelial cell receptor sites. Proteinaceous fibers on the cell wall of uropathogenic Escherichia coli, called fimbriae, produce adhesion molecules that attach to these monosaccharide or oligosaccharide receptors on uroepithelial cells. Two different fimbrial types are most important for initiating UTI: type 1 fimbriae, which adhere to man- nose-specific receptors; and P fimbriae, which adhere to disaccharide α -d-Gal(1,4)- β -d-Gal (Gal-Gal) receptors. Modern research has revealed that the proanthocyanidins (PACs) in cranberries can inhibit the adhesion of uropathogenic P-fimbriated strains of E. coli to bladder cells.26–28 Cranberry contains two different inhibitors: fructose, effective for inhibiting the type 1 fimbriae; and a second, unidentified inhibitor that is effective for obstructing the Gal- Gal–specific fimbriae.29 However, fructose is fully metabolized after con- sumption and does not reach the urine. Therefore it does not influence bacterial adhesion in the body. In addition, scientific evidence suggests that cranberry acts on the cell wall not only by preventing attachment of the fimbrial subunits but also by serving as a genetic control, preventing the expression of normal fimbrial subunits, or both.30–33 In animal models, investigations of approximately 77 clinical isolates of E. coli demonstrated that cranberry juice inhibited bacterial adhesion to the bladder by more than 75% for more than 60% of the strains of bacte- ria.34 Further research demonstrated that cranberry significantly reduced the adherence of pathogens to urinary epithelial cells isolated from patients with UTIs, including Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.35,36 The cumulative effects of cranberry have now been demonstrated as successfully acting on cell walls to prevent the proper attachment of the fimbrial subunits, thus inhibiting bacterial adherence to uroepithe- lial cells, and cellular elongation.37 The role of PACs in UTIs has been debated because of their size, poor bioavailability, and extensive metabolism and limited knowledge about their urinary excretion.38 In vivo research has demonstrated that consumption of cranberry PACs results in an antiadhesion response in the urine to provide protective effects from bacteria that migrate from the perineum and vagina.39 Research continues to investigate whether the PACs induce a direct urinary response or are broken down to smaller bioactive metabolites that reach the urine. Larger PACs that are eliminated through the colon may bind to rec- tal uropathogenic bacterial isolates in the gut, thus decreasing the viru- lence of these microbes if they come in contact with the uroepithelium. Researchers in Finland who studied the UTI preventive effects of a commercially available cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate stated that their findings support bacterial selection in the stool because sub- jects in the cranberry group had no increase in UTI recurrence during the 6 months after they had stopped the cranberry prophylaxis.40 More recently, a study was undertaken to determine whether the polyphenols follow a dose response in vivo at different levels of intake. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 10 healthy men with cranberry juice containing 409, 787, 1238, 1534, and 1910 mg total polyphenols was performed. The results demonstrated that plasma polyphenol metabolites are linearly related to the amount of polyphe- nols consumed and that individual variations may occur due to the gut microbiome.41 Emerging concepts regarding preventive considerations for the management of recurrent UTIs (RUTIs) suggest taking cranberry sup- plements as part of the protocol.42 Numerous investigations have been completed on cranberry. The following discussion provides an overview of some of the recent data, including a review of studies on cranberry and urinary tract health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cranberry Juice

An early study conducted by Avorn et al.43 evaluated the effects of cranberry on bacteriuria in 153 elderly women. Participants consumed 300 mL/day of either a commercially available cranberry beverage or a placebo drink that was similar in taste and contained vitamin C but no cranberry content. After 1 month of treatment, 15% of the urine samples of those who had been drinking cranberry juice had bacteri- uria with pyuria, compared with 28% of those in the placebo group. Most patients with bacteriuria were asymptomatic. Although statisti- cal significance was not achieved, there was a trend toward less anti- biotic use for the treatment of UTIs in the cranberry group (1.7 vs. 3.2 antibiotics per 100 patient-months). A criticism of this trial is that the control group had a higher rate of urinary infection before the study, suggesting there may have been sampling bias, and the main outcome, identified as asymptomatic bacteriuria, does not generally require treatment.44 Although there was a trend toward fewer clinically relevant urinary infections, the study was not designed to demonstrate that effect. This trial, like others, had a high dropout rate, which casts doubt on the long-term tolerability of cranberry juice.45,46

## Urinary Tract Infections and Sexual Activity

Foxman et al.47 randomly sampled 288 control subjects (college students), studying first-time UTIs in young unmarried women. Participants were recruited from a university health service, and all had engaged in sexual intercourse at least once. Compared with the general

population of students, intercourse significantly increased the risk of UTIs (43%), as did drinking carbonated soft drinks (237%), but it was found that drinking cranberry juice reduced the risk (52%). A study in France investigated the effect of consuming a single postcoital dose of cranberry on the development of UTIs. This dou- ble-blind study evaluated 120 female patients with recurrent UTI (six or more in the previous 12 months). Patients were randomized to one of three groups and received either one capsule of infused cranberry powder made by a patented procedure (Bio-Shield, Cran-Max, known commercially in France as GynDelta), one capsule of dry cranberry extract containing 36 mg of PAC, or one capsule containing a placebo. Patients were instructed to take their test product within 6 hours after intercourse. Over the course of the study period of 45 days, 10.8% of patients in the GynDelta group suffered a UTI, compared with 18.9% in the cranberry PAC group and 43.2% in the placebo group. The results for the GynDelta were statistically significant (P = 0.005).48

## Cranberry Juice and the Adhesion of Antibiotic-Resistant

<!-- chunk -->

## Uropathogens

Howell et al.49 carried out an ex vivo study verifying cranberry’s ability to prevent the adhesion of certain E. coli strains that are resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.49 The researchers obtained 39 uro- pathogenic P-fimbriated E. coli isolates, 24 of which were resistant, from women with culture-confirmed UTIs. Incubation of the bacteria in the urine collected from participants who consumed 240 mL of cran- berry juice cocktail prevented adhesion in 31 of 39 isolates, including 19 of 24 resistant isolates; antiadhesion activity began within 2 hours of exposure and persisted for up to 10 hours. Because the mechanism of action is not bactericidal, the use of cranberry does not increase the selection for antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. A reduction in the frequency of infections may decrease the frequency of antibiotic use, saving first-line antibiotics for other infections.50

## Trials Involving Catheterization, Neurogenic Bladders, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Spinal Cord–Injured Patients

Rates of bacteriuria and symptomatic UTIs in individuals who receive clean intermittent catheterization are an enduring concern. Schlager et al.,51 comparing cranberry with placebo, completed a 3-month dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of children (n = 15) with neurogenic bladders treated with intermittent catheterization. The researchers reported that 75% of 151 cultures indicated bacteriuria at both sample intervals. In this case, there was no difference between the children drinking cranberry concentrate and those receiving a pla- cebo. Reid et al.52 examined 15 spinal cord–injured (SCI) patients to ascertain whether cranberry juice altered bacterial biofilm load in the bladder. They found that cranberry juice significantly diminished bio- film load compared with baseline, with a reduction in the adhesion of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to cells. Water intake did not affect bacterial adhesion. Linsenmeyer et al.53 completed a prospective, double-blind, place- bo-controlled crossover study of 21 individuals with neurogenic blad- ders secondary to SCI who were randomly assigned to receive either 400-mg cranberry tablets or placebo three times a day for 4 weeks.53 Cranberry tablets did not modify urinary pH or reduce bacterial counts, urinary white blood cell counts, or the number of UTIs in indi- viduals with neurogenic bladder. The most recent study evaluated the effect of cranberry tablets for the prevention of UTI in SCI patients with neurogenic bladder. Patients were randomized to receive 6 months of cranberry tablets (Cran-Max) or placebo, followed by the alternate preparation for an additional 6 months. Forty-seven subjects completed the trial. The researchers found a reduction in the likelihood of UTI and symptoms for any month in patients receiving the cranberry tablet (P < 0.05 for all). During the cranberry period, 6 subjects had 7 UTIs, compared with 16 subjects and 21 UTIs in the placebo period (P < 0.05 for both number of subjects and incidence). The frequency of UTI was reduced to 0.3 UTIs per year versus 1 UTI per year in those receiving placebo. Subjects with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 75 mL/ min received the most benefit.54 Further long-term studies evaluating specific types of bladder man- agement and UTI will help determine the role of cranberries in indi- viduals who have neurogenic bladder, require catheterization, or have a spinal cord injury.

## Comparative Trial Subsequent to Antibiotic Therapy

The use of cranberry supplements in women with UTI after antibiotic treatment may reduce the recurrence of UTI. In an open-label trial in Finland, Kontiokari et al.55 treated 150 women with UTI due to E. coli with a standard antimicrobial regimen; then the participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 mL of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for 6 months, 100 mL of Lactobacillus drink 5 days a week for 1 year, or no intervention. At 6 months, 16% of the women in the cranberry group, 39% in the Lactobacillus group, and 36% in the control group had UTIs. This finding demonstrates that a regu- lar intake of cranberry juice but not Lactobacillus seems to reduce the recurrence of UTI.

## Comparative Trials—Antibiotic Versus Cranberry for UTI

<!-- chunk -->

## Prevention

McMurdo et al.56 compared the effectiveness of cranberry extract or low-dose trimethoprim in the prevention of recurrent UTIs in a group of 137 women with two or more antibiotic-treated UTIs in the previ- ous 12 months. Subjects were randomized to receive either 500 mg of cranberry (Cran-Max) or 100 mg of trimethoprim for 6 months. Thirty-nine of 137 participants (28%) had an antibiotic-treated UTI (25 in the cranberry group and 14 in the trimethoprim group; difference in proportions relative risk 1.616 [95% confidence interval: 0.93, 2.79], P = 0.084). The time to the first recurrence of UTI was not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.100). The median time to recurrence of UTI was 84.5 days for the cranberry group and days for the trimethoprim group (U = 166, P = 0.479). The researchers concluded that trimethoprim had a very limited advantage over cranberry extract in the prevention of recurrent UTIs in older women and that it had more adverse effects.56 Beerepoot et al.57 conducted a double-blind study of 221 premeno- pausal women with recurrent UTIs who were randomized to 12-month prophylaxis use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), mg once a day, or cranberry capsules (Cran-Max), 500 mg twice a day. Primary end points were the mean number of symptomatic UTIs over 12 months, the proportion of patients with at least 1 symptomatic UTI, the median time to first UTI, and development of antibiotic resistance in indigenous E. coli. After 12 months, the mean number of patients with at least one symptomatic UTI was higher in the cranberry than in the TMP-SMX group (4.0 vs. 1.8; P = .02), and the proportion of patients with at least one symptomatic UTI was higher in the cranberry than in the TMP- SMX group (78.2% vs. 71.1%). Median time to the first symptomatic UTI was 4 months for the cranberry and 8 months for the TMP-SMX group. Although the antibiotic was slightly more effective in prevent- ing UTI, the subjects receiving antibiotics developed significant resis- tance to several antibiotics primarily used to prevent and treat UTIs. After 1 month, in the TMP-SMX group, 86.3% of fecal and 90.5% of asymptomatic bacteriuria E. coli isolates were TMP-SMX resistant. There were also significantly increased resistance rates for

trimethoprim alone, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin in these E. coli iso- lates after 1 month in the TMP-SMX group. Antibiotic resistance did not increase in the cranberry group. The cranberry product and TMP- SMX were equally well tolerated.

## Effectiveness as a Prophylactic Against Urinary Tract

<!-- chunk -->

## Infection

Stothers58 executed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that eval- uated, from a societal perspective, the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of concentrated cranberry tablets, cranberry juice, and placebo for prophylaxis against lower UTI in adult women. Sexually active women (n = 150) aged 21 to 72 years were randomly assigned for 1 year to one of the following three groups: • Placebo juice + placebo tablets • Placebo juice + cranberry tablets • Cranberry juice + placebo tablets The tablets were a proprietary extract of cranberry (30:1), given twice a day. The juice was a pure unsweetened cranberry juice (not cranberry cocktail) given in doses of 250 mL three times a day. Outcome measures demonstrated greater than 50% decreases in both symptomatic UTIs per year and annual antibiotic consumption. Both cranberry juice and cranberry tablets, in a statistically significant manner, decreased the number of patients experiencing at least one symptomatic UTI per year (20% and 18%, respectively) compared with placebo (32%). Total annual antibiotic consumption was lower in both treatment groups than in the placebo group. Cost-effectiveness ratios showed that cranberry tablets were twice as cost-effective as juice for the prevention of UTIs. Ledda et al. investigated the prophylactic effects of a standardized cranberry extract in young subjects (age 12–18 years) with a previous history of recurrent UTIs, over a 2-month follow-up. Subjects received either standard management (SM) (control group, n = 17) or SM with daily oral supplementation (supplementation group, n = 19). Oral supplementation consisted of one capsule containing 120 mg of cran- berry extract (Anthocran), standardized to 36 mg proanthocyanidins, for 60 days. The effectiveness in the prevention of UTIs was deter- mined by the number of UTIs evaluated 2 months before the inclusion in the registry and during the supplementation period and the number of symptom-free subjects during the registry period. Safety consider- ations were included, and measurement of adherence to treatment was also performed.59 The mean number of UTIs observed during the registry in the supplemented group (0.31 ± 0.2) was significantly lower compared with the control group (2.3 ± 1.3) and with the mean number of UTIs assessed before inclusion (1.74 ± 1.1) (p-value = 0.0001 for both). Moreover, 63.1% of supplemented subjects were symptom-free during the registry period, whereas 23.5% subjects were asymptomatic in the control group (p-value < 0.05). This study provides encouraging evi- dence on the efficacy of cranberry for prevention in young subjects experiencing recurrent UTIs. A Cochrane review of clinical trials on cranberry for preventing UTIs was conducted in 2008. Ten studies (n = 1049) met the inclu- sion criteria (five crossover, five parallel-group). Cranberry/cranber- ry-lingonberry juice versus placebo, juice, or water was evaluated in seven studies, and cranberry tablets versus placebo in four studies (one study evaluated both juice and tablets). Cranberry products signifi- cantly reduced the incidence of UTIs at 12 months (risk ratio [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–0.90) compared with placebo. Cranberry products were more effective in reducing the incidence of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs compared with elderly men and women or people requiring catheterization. Side effects and dropouts or withdrawals were common in all studies and were high in several of the studies. The authors concluded, “there is some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12-month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. Its effectiveness for other groups is less certain. The large number of drop- outs/withdrawals indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. It is not clear what the optimum dosage or method of administration (e.g., juice, tablets, or capsules) is. Further properly designed studies with relevant outcomes are needed.”60 A more recent 2017 Cochrane review reported similar benefit in reduc- ing UTIs (weighted RR 0.67, p < 0.0001), with the best results seen in those who, for whatever reason, were more susceptible to UTIs.61 Subsequent to Cochrane’s earlier review, further studies have eval- uated the effect of cranberry supplements, including two studies that compared cranberry (Cran-Max) to antibiotics (as previously dis- cussed) for reducing UTI recurrence. Sengupta et al.62 evaluated the effects of a standardized cranberry product (PACran) on reducing the recurrence of symptomatic UTI in culture-positive subjects. This 90-day randomized clinical trial involved 60 female subjects aged 18 to 40 years who were randomly assigned to three groups: an untreated control group (n = 16), a low- dose (500 mg daily, n = 21) treatment group, and a high-dose (1000 mg daily, n = 23) treatment group. The safety of the cranberry product was assessed by evaluation of biochemical and hematological parame- ters on days 10, 30, 60, and 90, comparing the values with those at the baseline. The occurrence of UTI at baseline and during the follow-up period was characterized by the presence of symptoms and E. coli in the culture of urine samples. At the end of the study, the change in the presence of E. coli in the untreated control group was not signifi- cant, whereas there was significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the subjects positive for E. coli in both the high- and low-dose treatment groups, compared with baseline evaluation. However, there were no significant differences in bacteriuria in the urine between in the cranberry groups and the untreated control group at any time point after the study com- menced. Symptomatic relief was also reported in the low- and high- dose treatment groups, whereas none was reported by subjects in the untreated control group.62

## Prophylaxis Urinary Tract Infections in Men With Prostate

<!-- chunk -->

## Disease

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) are a common condition in older men, particularly among those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and chronic prostatitis (CP). It is postulated that cranberry may offer benefits for men with prostate disease above and beyond its ability to inhibit uroepithelial bacterial adhesion and reduce UTI occurrence. Among the recently reported effects of cranberry are its anti-inflam- matory action through reduced cyclooxygenase-2 expression, suppres- sion of IkBa degradation in human colon cancer cells,63 and inhibition of the growth and proliferation of several types of tumor cells, includ- ing prostate cancer cells.64 A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a 6-month daily consumption of 1500 mg cranberry fruit powder (PACran) on urinary tract function in men with LUTSs based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), BPH, and histopathologically confirmed nonbacterial CP. In contrast to the control group, patients in the cranberry group had statistically signifi- cant improvement in the IPSS; quality-of-life score; urination param- eters, including voiding parameters (rate of urine flow, average flow, total volume, and postvoid residual urine volume); and lower total PSA level on day 180 of the study. There was no statistically signifi- cant improvement in the control group. The results of this preliminary trial are the first firm evidence that cranberries may ameliorate LUTSs, independent of BPH or C-reactive protein level.65

## Reducing Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Ileal Enterocystoplasty

Bacteriuria is a usual complication of enterocystoplasty after cystec- tomy. Botto et al.66 evaluated the effectiveness of treatment with a cran- berry supplement in the prevention of repeated bacteriuria in patients with an ileal enterocystoplasty. This open study included 15 patients with a history of repeated urinary infection and/or bacteriuria during the pretreatment phase. During the treatment phase, patients received a cranberry preparation with 36 mg PACs (Urell), one capsule a day. The primary end point was the absence of bacteria in urine culture. The secondary end points were the presence or absence of symptoms (pain, fever), continence status, and upper excretory tract enlarge- ment. There was a significant decrease in the number of positive urine cultures during cranberry compound treatment. These results need to be validated by further double-blind, randomized studies.

## Reduction in Urinary Odor

Urinary odor, common in elderly people, may be reduced after the administration of cranberry.4,67,68 Ammonia odor may be reduced by cranberry because the bacterial populations are decreased, and they produce less ammonia as a by-product of metabolism.

## Other Clinical Applications

Although much of the focus on the benefits of cranberry has been on UTIs, cranberry may offer other health benefits, some of which are described in the following subsections.

## Antioxidant

Oxidation, or the production of free radicals, is involved in the progres- sion of many bodily processes that can lead to disease and afflictions, especially as we age. Cranberry contains antioxidants that can scav- enge free radicals. Of the berries, blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, and raspberries have the highest levels of antioxidants.69–71 Pedersen et al.72 studied the effects of blueberry and cranberry consumption on the plasma antioxidant capacity of healthy female volunteers.72 Daily ingestion of 500 mL of cranberry juice increased plasma phenolic con- tent and antioxidant capacity. Consumption of a similar amount of blueberry did not have this effect.


Cranberries contain salicylic acid, the active metabolite of acetylsal- icylic acid (aspirin), which has been used historically to treat pain, inflammation, and fever. More recently, researchers have shown that regular intake of sal- icylic acid may be associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colon cancer. Although the exact mechanism of salicylic acid is unknown, research has shown that it inhibits the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), thereby decreasing the syn- thesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins. A study was conducted to measure the bioavailability of these anti-inflammatory compounds in cranberry juice. Two groups of healthy female subjects consumed either 250 mL of cranberry juice or a placebo solution three times a day for 2 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected from the subjects and measured for salicylic acid and its urinary metabolite, salicyluric acid. After 1 week, research- ers saw a marked increase in urinary salicylic acid and salicyluric acid in those consuming cranberry juice over those consuming placebo solution. Concentrations of the urinary metabolite were significantly greater than salicylic acid, which is a good indicator of bioavailability. The increase in plasma concentrations of the cranberry group was less extreme but still statistically significant after 2 weeks of consumption.73 Researchers have questioned whether sufficient amounts of salicylic acid can be obtained from the diet to exert anti-inflammatory effects similar to those seen from aspirin. Salicylic acid is present in many plant-based foods in varying amounts, and little is known about the bioavailability of these active compounds when obtained from food sources. However, serum and urinary concentrations of salicylic and salicyluric acids are greater in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians and overlap with those in individuals taking up to 150 mg of aspirin per day (a baby aspirin contains 81 mg). This suggests that potentially thera- peutic levels of salicylic acid could be achieved by consuming salicylic acid–rich foods, such as cranberries. Antiangiogenic approaches to prevent and treat cancer represent a priority area in investigative tumor biology. Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a crucial role in the vascularization of tumors. In vitro research on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells has shown that edible berries impair angiogenesis.74 Several in vitro studies on cranberry have reported similar promising outcomes. Researchers at the University of Western Ontario discovered that mice receiving cranberry juice and cranberry products had a signifi- cantly lower incidence of breast cancer than the control group, and the development of tumors was delayed in the cranberry-fed group. The proliferation of tumors to the lungs and lymph nodes was markedly reduced in the cranberry-fed group. A greater effect was demonstrated by the cranberry solids than the juice. Ongoing research is examining whether the activity of the berry solids traces largely to one component or to several potentially acting in synergy.75 A PAC fraction, an extract of concentrated flavonoids, and triter- penoid esters of cranberry were evaluated in an in vitro cell culture model and exhibited potential anticarcinogenic activity, demonstrat- ing an ability to inhibit tumor cell growth.76–78 A synergistic or additive antiproliferative interaction of the anthocyanins, PACs, and flavonol glycosides within cranberry extract has also been demonstrated by in vitro research on human tumor cells.79 A combination of six berry extracts (wild blueberry, bilberry, cran- berry, elderberry, raspberry seeds, strawberry) was studied for antiox- idant efficacy, cytotoxic potential, cellular uptake, and antiangiogenic properties. The combination of anthocyanin-rich berries was reported to show antiangiogenic, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic potentials.80

## Vascular Disease

Research indicates that the consumption of flavonoids in foods and beverages may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.81 In vitro and in vivo experiments with cranberry flavonoids demonstrate that they inhibit the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), platelet aggregation and adhesion, and enzymes involved in lipid/lipoprotein metabolism (which affects the immune response to oxidized LDL-c and its uptake by endothelial macrophages). It may also induce endo- thelium-dependent vasorelaxation and increase reverse cholesterol transport, thereby decreasing total cholesterol and LDL-c values. Wilson et al.82 showed in vitro that cranberry extracts reduce oxida- tion of LDL-c.82 A review by Reed83 examined the effects of flavonoids on atherosclerosis, with an emphasis on the potential positive effects of the flavonols and PACs in cranberries.83 Youdim et al.84 investigated the putative antioxidant and anti-in- flammatory effects of blueberry and cranberry anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids. The polyphenols isolated from both berries afforded protection for endothelial cells against stressor-induced upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory insults. This may have beneficial actions against the initiation and development of vascular diseases and may be a contributing factor in the reduction of age-re- lated deficits in neurological impairments.84 Ruel et al.85 examined the effect of daily consumption of a low-cal- orie cranberry juice cocktail on plasma oxidized LDL (oxLDL), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion

molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin concentrations in men. Thirty men (mean age 51 years) were recruited and asked to consume increas- ing daily doses of cranberry juice cocktail (125, 250, and 500 mL/d) over three successive periods of 4 weeks. Plasma oxLDL and adhesion molecule concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay (ELISA) before and after each phase. The researchers noted a statistically significant decrease in plasma oxLDL, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1.

## Glycemic Control and Insulin Resistance

There is mounting evidence from animal studies supporting the bene- fits of dietary polyphenols for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes by improving glycemic control and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. The benefits may be due to inhibition of carbohydrate digestion by inhibiting salivary and pancreatic α -amylase and α -gluco- sidase in the small intestinal brush border, inhibition of glucose absorp- tion, and stimulation of insulin secretion and protection of pancreatic β -cells against glucotoxicity. Polyphenols may suppress glucose release from the liver and improve glucose uptake in peripheral tissues by mod- ulating intracellular signaling. Polyphenols have antioxidant activity and can inhibit advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) formation.86,87 A study by Paquette et al. evaluated the effects of strawberry and cranberry polyphenols (SCPs) on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, lipid profile, inflammation, and oxidative stress mark- ers in free-living insulin-resistant overweight or obese human subjects (n = 41) in a parallel, double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial. The experimental group consumed an SCP beverage (333 mg SCP) daily for 6 weeks, whereas the control group received a flavor-matched control beverage that contained 0 mg SCP. At the beginning and end of the experimental period, insulin sensitivity was assessed by a hyperin- sulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and glucose tolerance and insulin secre- tion were assessed by a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin sensitivity increased in the SCP group compared with the control group (+0.9 [sem 0.5] × 10-3 vs. −0.5 [sem 0.5] × 10-3 mg/kg per min per pmol, respectively, P = 0.03). Compared with the control group, the SCP group had a lower first-phase insulin secretion response as measured by C-peptide levels during the first 30 min of the OGTT (P = 0.002). No differences were detected between the two groups for lipids and mark- ers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The authors concluded that a 6-week dietary intervention with 333 mg of polyphenols from strawber- ries and cranberries improved insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese nondiabetic, insulin-resistant human subjects but was not effective in improving other cardiometabolic risk factors.88

## Helicobacter Pylori

Burger et al.89 argue that because cranberry has been shown to inhibit bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells, it may also be useful as antiad- hesion therapy in H. pylori infections. In a number of small in vitro studies, the investigators demonstrated that a high-molecular-weight (HMW) constituent of cranberry inhibits sialyllactose-specific adhe- sion of Heliobacter pylori to a human gastric cell line and mucus as well as human erythrocytes.89 This research warrants further investigation into the use of cranberry as it relates to H. pylori.

## Oral Bacteria

The effect of cranberry on the coaggregation (massing together) of oral bacteria has been tested. Weiss et al.90 discovered an HMW nondialyz- able material, composed mainly of PACs isolated from cranberry juice. Although the molecular structure of this material and its mechanism of action are not known, in vitro studies showed that coaggregation of pairs of bacteria was inhibited, and pilot in vivo studies showed that coaggregation of a large number of different pairs was reversed.91 Studies using mouthwash demonstrated positive results and war- rant additional research. Weiss92 conducted a small pilot study of individuals (n = 59) using a standard mouthwash that contained this HMW constituent.92 After 6 weeks of daily use, results showed a reduc- tion in colony-forming units of bacteria in saliva compared with pla- cebo. These data and those of more recent studies provide evidence that inhibition of oral streptococci colonization and attachment to the tooth surface in vivo is due to the antiadhesion activity of the cranberry constituent.93 Another study hypothesized the inhibition of extracellu- lar polysaccharide synthesis, which promotes the sucrose-dependent adhesion of oral bacteria.94,95

## Peristomal Problems

Tsukada et al.6 conducted a small study on the incidence of peristomal problems in 13 patients who had undergone urostomy. Patients drank 160 to 320 g/day of cranberry juice for an average of 6 months. Four of six patients who initially had erythema, maceration, or pseudoepithe- lial hyperplasia at the stoma site showed improvement. This apparent protective effect for the skin against urine may be relevant for patients who are immobile and incontinent and suffer skin damage as a result. Additional studies to confirm this finding are warranted.28

## Managing Calcium Oxalate Urolithiasis

Investigations of the potential influence of cranberry juice on urinary biochemical and physicochemical risk factors associated with the for- mation of calcium oxalate kidney stones have been reported. Older research with renal stones reported a reduction in urinary calcium excretion after the studied patients drank cranberry juice, suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of recurrent renal stones.96 Urinary variables were assessed by McHarg et al.97 in a randomized crossover trial (n = 20) in participants with no previous history of kid- ney stones. The ingestion of cranberry juice significantly and uniquely altered three key urinary risk factors. Oxalate and phosphate excretion decreased, whereas citrate excretion increased. In addition, there was a reduction in the relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate, which tended to be significantly lower than that induced by water alone. Each of these outcomes is desirable in patients at risk for nephrolithiasis (urolithiasis). The investigators concluded that cranberry juice has antilithogenic properties and deserves consideration as a conservative therapeutic protocol in managing calcium oxalate urolithiasis. The use of cranberry may be warranted in some patients with recurrent renal stones, but supplementary research is needed.28


There are a variety of cranberry products to choose from that vary greatly in quality, potency, and activity. Differences exist between the level of bioactives (PACs) and formulation in commercially available tablets, capsules, and juices. Many products on the market are not standardized, being either dried whole-fruit powders, juice powders, or mixed juices with undefined amounts of cranberry juice. Although drinking cranberry juice is one way to get the health ben- efits of this berry, it may not be ideal for all people. Most commer- cial cranberry juice cocktails contain only 27% to 33% pure cranberry juice, with sugar and water making up the rest of the volume. Such drinks are often high in calories. Encapsulated cranberry powders can be a convenient alternative to cranberry juice cocktail, especially for people who do not like the taste of cranberry; those who are traveling; or those concerned about the calories, sugar, or other sweeteners. Healthcare providers directing their patients in selecting effective products should ensure that they find the most palatable product and should encourage long-term adherence. In the case of UTI prevention,

this strategy may reduce an individual’s potential for the development of the disorder while also decreasing the need for antibiotics. On the basis of the clinical studies, the amount of cranberry juice recommended for the prevention of UTIs is 1 to 10 oz a day; however, the ideal dosage has not yet been determined.43,59,98 For use as a urinary deodorizer for incontinent patients, 3 to 6 oz (90–180 mL) per day of cranberry juice has been used.63 Tablets and capsules are often taken in doses of 500 mg once or twice a day, depending on the concentration of cranberry. Approximately 1500 g of fresh fruit produces 1 L of juice.14,98

# ADVERSE EFFECTS

Taken orally, cranberry is generally well tolerated. No significant adverse effects have thus far been reported. However, cranberry juice at high doses of 3 to 4 L per day may cause gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.5 Patients with diabetes should minimize cranberry juice sweetened with sugar or fruit juice.98 In theory, regular cranberry juice intake may precipitate the for- mation of urinary stones. However, urinary oxalate excretion does not rise after the drinking of cranberry juice, and no studies have reported stone formation as a complication. Cranberry contains salicylic acid, which is structurally similar to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and thus should be used cautiously in those with an allergy to aspirin.


Cranberry contains flavonoids, which are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes; thus various drug interactions have been theorized. One recent study investigated the effect of cranberry on the cyto- chrome P450 3A4 enzymes. Human CYP3A4 is the most important human CYP isozyme because it is involved in the metabolism of approximately 50% of drugs and some environmental toxins. Several brands of cranberry supplements were included in this study. The researchers found that cranberry had no significant inhibitory effect on human CYP3A4, and thus it is unlikely to cause significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, such as felodipine, nifedipine, midazolam, cyclosporine, and atorvastatin. A few case reports have suggested an interaction between cranberry and warfarin, affecting international normalized ratio (INR) values and increasing the risk of bruising and bleeding. Warfarin is metabo- lized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzymes. These reports were poorly documented, and confounding factors may have been involved.99–101 Recently, several researchers have examined the potential inter- action between cranberry and warfarin. Seven separate interaction studies assessed valid and accepted pharmacodynamic (PD) and/or pharmacokinetic end points, examining a total exposure of 75 patients and healthy volunteers. Six of these studies concluded that a cran- berry juice–warfarin interaction is unlikely.102–107 One study claimed a potential PD interaction on the basis of the assessment of an inap- propriate and unconventional AUC-based PD parameter and the use of a single, very high dose (25 mg) of warfarin in healthy volunteers.108 A review of the body of research on the potential interaction between cranberry and warfarin concluded that there is no evidence of the risk of a clinically relevant interaction between warfarin and cranberry products from peer-reviewed interaction studies when cranberry juice is consumed in moderation. One cannot exclude the possibility of an interaction with the consumption of excessive quan- tities of cranberry products; however, it does not appear necessary to avoid normal levels of consumption of cranberry products (two 8-ounce glasses a day).109 Cranberry is often recommended along with low-dose oral antibi- otics for prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs. One recent study evaluated the potential risk of pharmacokinetic interactions between cranberry juice and the β -lactams amoxicillin (amoxicillin) and cefaclor and determined that concurrent use of cranberry juice had no significant effect on the extent of oral absorption or the renal clearance of amox- icillin and cefaclor.110

ligaments, and cartilage. Collagen is destroyed during the inflamma- tory processes that occur in rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, and other inflammatory conditions involving bones, joints, cartilage, and other connective tissue. Anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, and other flavonoids are remarkable in their ability to prevent collagen destruction. The antho- cyanidins in V. myrtillus extracts have been shown to affect collagen metabolism in the following ways: • Anthocyanosides cross-link collagen fibers, resulting in strength- ening of the natural cross-linking of the collagen that forms the collagen matrix of connective tissue (ground substance, cartilage, tendon, etc.).6–10 • Anthocyanosides, with their potent antioxidant and free-radical– scavenging action, prevent free-radical damage.6–9,11,60 • Anthocyanosides inhibit enzymatic cleavage of collagen by enzymes secreted by leukocytes during inflammation.6–8,10–12 • Anthocyanosides and other flavonoid components of V. myrtil- lus prevent the release and synthesis of compounds that promote inflammation, such as histamine, serine proteases, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.6–8,13,14 • Anthocyanosides promote mucopolysaccharide and collagen bio- synthesis and stimulate reticulation of collagen fibrils.15–17

## Normalization of Capillary Permeability

Anthocyanosides have strong “vitamin P” activity.6 Included in their effects is the ability to raise intracellular vitamin C levels and reduce capillary permeability and fragility.6–8 Their effect in reducing capillary fragility and permeability is roughly twice that of rutin in both inten- sity and duration of action.18 V. myrtillus extracts have been widely used in Europe in the treat- ment of various arterial, venous, and capillary disorders. Clinical studies have demonstrated a positive effect in the treatment of the fol- lowing conditions19–24: • Capillary fragility • Blood purpuras • Various encephalic circulation disturbances (similar to Ginkgo biloba) • Venous insufficiency • Varicose veins • Microscopical hematuria caused by diffuse and kidney capillary fragility V. myrtillus’s efficacy in the treatment of a variety of venous disor- ders relates to the ability of anthocyanosides to protect altered veins (postphlebitic veins as well as varicose veins) via two mechanisms17: (1) increasing the endothelial barrier effect by stabilizing the mem- brane phospholipids and (2) increasing the biosynthesis of the acid mucopolysaccharides of the connective ground substance, thus restor- ing the altered mucopolysaccharide pericapillary sheath. This latter effect leads to a marked increase in newly formed capillaries and col- lagen fibrils. One interesting effect of the normalization of collagen structures and capillaries is the demonstration that anthocyanosides from V. myrtillus reduce the permeability of the blood–brain barrier.10,25 Greater blood–brain permeability has been linked to autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), schizophrenia, “cerebral allergies,” and a variety of other CNS disorders. Presumably, the antho- cyanosides inhibit both enzymatic and nonenzymatic degradation of the basement membrane collagen of brain capillaries, thus helping maintain or restore the brain’s protection from drugs, pollutants, nat- urally occurring degradation products, and other cerebral toxins.9–12,25 Another study further demonstrated the remarkable efficacy of bil- berry in protecting and strengthening the capillaries and microcircu- lation. In this study, the effects of anthocyanidins on hamster cheek microcirculation after ischemia and reperfusion were investigated. The treated group had diminished adherence of leukocytes to the venules after reperfusion, resulting in prevention of the markedly increased capillary permeability seen in the placebo group.26

## Antiaggregation Effect on Platelets

Anthocyanosides, like many other flavonoids, have been shown to have significant antiaggregation effects on platelets.27–29 Their action in vivo appears to be direct antiaggregation effects on the platelets and an indirect effect via prostacyclin-like action.27–29 Prostacyclin is a potent stimulator of adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate from adenosine tri- phosphate. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate prevents platelets from aggregating and adhering to the endothelial surface.

## Smooth Muscle–Relaxing Activity

## Effects on Cancer Cells

An in vitro study demonstrated that among ethanol extracts of edible berries, bilberry extract was the most effective at inhibiting the growth of human leukemia cells and colon carcinoma cells.34 Bilberry extract was shown to possess dual action in this regard through the induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and promotion of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 122.2). Bilberry anthocyanidins have also been shown to inhibit angiogen- esis.35 Bilberry extract was the most potent of the extracts tested because it contained the largest amounts of phenolic compounds, including anthocyanins, and showed the greatest free-radical–scav- enging activity. Pure delphinidin and malvidin, like the glyco- sides isolated from the bilberry extract, induced apoptosis in the leukemia cells. However, only pure delphinidin and the glycoside isolated from the bilberry extract, but not malvidin and the glyco- side, inhibited the growth of human colon cancer cells. Twenty- five patients with colorectal cancer scheduled to undergo resection of primary tumors or liver metastases received 1.4, 2.8, or 5.6 g

(containing 0.5–2.0 g of anthocyanins) daily for 7 days before sur- gery. In tumor tissue from all patients, proliferation was decreased by 7% compared with preintervention values.36


The primary clinical application of bilberry extracts has been in the prevention and treatment of a diverse group of disorders of the eye and vision. However, the same mechanisms of action that benefit the eye are of value for other health problems, especially those involving capillary dysfunction or inflammation.

## Ophthalmological Applications

<!-- chunk -->

## Night Vision and Eye Fatigue

Perhaps the most significant clinical applications for V. myrtil- lus extracts are in the field of ophthalmology. Interest in V. myrtil- lus anthocyanosides was first aroused when it was observed that the administration of bilberry extracts to healthy subjects resulted in improved nighttime visual acuity, quicker adjustment to darkness, and faster restoration of visual acuity after exposure to glare.37,38 Further studies confirmed these results,39–42 which were most impressive in individuals with pigmentary retinitis and hemeralopia. (Hemeralopia refers to “day blindness,” or an inability to see as distinctly in bright light as in dim light.) It appears that in addition to their effect on capillaries, V. myrtillus anthocyanosides have an affinity for the pigmented epithelium of the retina, which makes up the optical or functional part of the retina.43 This feature is consistent with several of the clinical effects observed. Anthocyanoside extracts of V. myrtillus appear to be of great value in both poor night vision and poor day vision. In a double- blind study in patients with eye strain and clinical symptoms of low to moderate myopia, 30 subjects were given either a purified high- dose anthocyanoside oligomer (a 100-mg tablet comprising 85% anthocyanoside oligomer) or a placebo tablet twice daily for 4 weeks. Before the treatment, the placebo and anthocyanoside groups were similar in terms of age and contrast sensitivity. Before and after treatment, subjects completed a questionnaire to determine their clinical symptoms and were also assessed for nocturnal visual func- tion using contrast sensitivity testing. Questionnaire data analysis showed that after treatment, 22 (73.3%) anthocyanoside subjects showed improved symptoms, whereas only 1 placebo subject showed an improvement. Contrast sensitivity levels significantly improved in the anthocyanoside group and remained stable in the placebo group. The mean change in contrast sensitivity in the anthocyanoside group was 2.41, compared with −0.66 decibels (dB) for the placebo group. At all cycle-per-degree levels, there were greater improvements in contrast sensitivity in the anthocyanoside group than in the placebo group. This very detailed clinical assessment demonstrated that the administration of anthocyanoside oligomer improves both subjective symptoms and objective contrast sensitivity in myopia subjects with asthenopia.44 One of the more practical applications of the beneficial effects of anthocyanosides and eye health is reducing eye fatigue from looking at a computer screen. In one double-blind trial, 88 office workers aged 20 to 40 years who used computer terminals and displayed low critical flicker fusion (CFF) and near-point accommodation (NPA) were randomized to either a bilberry extract (480 mg/day) or placebo (vehicle) group for 8 weeks. The reduction in CFF was alleviated after 8 weeks of bilberry extract supplementation in contrast to placebo supplementation, whereas NPA variation was not. Of the subjective symptoms of eye fatigue, com- puter screen load–induced ocular fatigue sensation, ocular pain, eye heaviness, uncomfortable sensation, and foreign-body sensation were mitigated more in the bilberry extract group than in the control group.45

collagen provides tensile strength and integrity to the tissues—cornea, sclera, lamina cribrosa, trabecular meshwork, and vitreous. Morphological changes in the collagen of the eye precede clinically detectable abnormalities. These changes may result in elevated intra- ocular pressure (IOP) readings or, perhaps more significantly, the pro- gression of peripheral vision loss. Changes in collagen structure would explain the following observations: • Similar peripheral vision loss in patients with normal and elevated IOP • Cupping of the optic disc even at low IOP levels • No apparent anatomical reason for decreased aqueous outflow (see Chapter 175 for complete discussion and references) Therefore primary prevention of glaucoma involves maintain- ing the integrity of the ground substance and collagen framework. It appears that preventing the breakdown of the collagen matrix is as important here as it is in other conditions involving collagen abnor- malities, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease. Consumption of V. myrtillus may offer significant protection against the development of glaucoma because of its collagen-enhanc- ing actions. In addition, anthocyanosides may be of benefit in the treatment of chronic glaucoma because rutin has been demonstrated to lower IOP when used as an adjunct in patients who are unresponsive to miotics alone.46 V. myrtillus anthocyanosides are generally much more biologically active than rutin.18

## Cataracts and Retinal Degeneration

V. myrtillus anthocyanosides may offer significant protection against the development of retinal (macular) degeneration and cataracts, particularly diabetic retinopathy and cataracts.47 Both the rate of retinal degeneration and the occurrence of cataracts in rats can be retarded by changing their diet from a commercial laboratory chow to a “well-defined diet.”48,49 Preliminary research suggests that flavonoid components in the well-de- fined diet may be responsible for the protective effects against cataracts and retinal degeneration.50 Limited research has shown that when com- bined with vitamin E, bilberry significantly slows the progression of senile cataracts in humans.51 V. myrtillus anthocyanoside extracts are widely used in Europe for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy.51–53 The positive effects noted in clinical trials may be due to improved capillary integrity as well as inhibition of sorbitol production (see Chapter 165). Flavonoids have been shown to be potent in vitro and in vivo inhibitors of sorbitol accumulation. In laboratory experiments, they have been found capa- ble of inhibiting the development of diabetic cataracts.54–56

## Other Clinical Applications

## Diabetes Mellitus

A decoction of bilberry leaves has a long history of folk use in the treatment of diabetes. This use is supported by research, which has shown that oral administration reduces hyperglycemia in normal and depancreatized dogs even when glucose is concurrently injected intravenously.53,57 Bilberry extract ameliorates hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity via activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase.58 The anthocyanoside myrtillin (3-glucoside of delphinidin) is apparently the most active hypoglycemic component of V. myrtillus. Upon injection, it is somewhat weaker than insulin, but it is also less toxic, even at 50 times the therapeutic dose of 1 g/day. It is of interest to note that a single dose can have beneficial effects lasting for several weeks.53 However, the most important benefits from the use of anthocya- nosides in the treatment of diabetes relate to their ability to improve collagen integrity and capillary permeability. Benefit also possibly derives from their ability to inhibit sorbitol accumulation, thus pro- viding protection from the serious vascular and neurological sequelae of diabetes. V. myrtillus anthocyanosides have also been shown to have a pro- tective effect on capillary fragility in diabetes and to reduce serum cho- lesterol and triglyceride levels in primary dyslipidemia.59 In animal studies, anthocyanosides significantly decrease the inti- mal proliferation, extracellular matrix production, and calcium and lipid deposition found in the aorta of untreated atherosclerotic rab- bits. Presumably, this decrease is a result of greater collagen cross-link- ing, which thus diminishes the permeability in small and large blood vessels.60

## Atherosclerosis and Metabolic Syndrome

Consumption of bilberries (like blueberries) or anthocyanoside extracts has been shown to protect against atherosclerosis through a number of mechanisms, including by decreasing total cholesterol, glu- cose, C-reactive protein, and platelet aggregation.61–64 The ability to reduce C-reactive protein and other markers of low-grade inflamma- tion was confirmed in patients with metabolic syndrome.63 Another very novel effect noted in the protection against vascular disease is improved endothelial function. Individuals given oral antho- cyanins (320 mg) for 12 weeks showed significant improvements in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).65 Vascular dilation is directly stimulated by nitric oxide (NO) released from the vascular endothelial cells. The vasodilator activity of NO is attributed to its diffusion to the vascular smooth muscle cells and the production of cGMP and cGMP-medi- ated vasodilation. Because the half-life of NO is extremely short, the circulating cGMP concentration is used as the index of NO activity and thus as an indirect marker of endothelium-dependent vasodila- tion. Compared with the control group, the treatment group showed significant increases in FMD (28.4% vs. 2.2%), cGMP (12.6% vs. −1.2%), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentra- tions but decreases in the serum soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels. Another piece of evidence indicating that anthocyanins increase NO vasodilation is that in the presence of inhibitors of NO-cGMP vasodilators, the effects of anthocyanin on endothelial function were not seen.

## Inflammatory Joint Disease

The effects of anthocyanosides on collagen structures and their potent antioxidant activity make V. myrtillus anthocyanoside extracts very useful in the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, most notably rheumatoid arthritis. Bioflavonoids have been found to increase collagen synthesis and inhibit collagen catabolism in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (a chronic progressive polyarthritis with some similarities to rheumatoid arthritis).15 Bilberries, like cherries, are particularly indicated in the treatment of gout because their flavonoid components can reduce both uric acid levels and tissue destruction (see Chapter 191).

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Bilberries or anthocyanin-rich extracts may have benefits in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In an open pilot trial with a total follow-up of 9 weeks, the effect of a daily standardized anthocyanin- rich bilberry extract was tested in 13 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC).66 At the end of the 6-week treatment interval, 63.4% of patients achieved remission, and 90.9% of patients showed a response. In all patients, a decrease in total Mayo score was detected (mean: 6.5 and 3.6 at screening and week 7, respectively; p < 0.001).

Levels of fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation, sig- nificantly decreased during the treatment phase (baseline: mean μ g/g; end of treatment: mean μ g/g), including four patients achiev- ing undetectable levels at the end of treatment. Bilberry anthocyanins inhibit interferon-induced signaling and downstream effects in human macrophages cells as well as modulate intestinal cytokine activity.67

## Microscopical Hematuria

The effect of V. myrtillus in the reduction of microscopical hematuria may reflect its tissue distribution. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats have demonstrated an affinity for the skin and kidneys.68 Anthocyanosides’ affinity for these tissues reflects the high concentration of collagen and mucopolysaccharides in the skin and kidneys and the fact that they are excreted via the kidneys.

## Other Effects

As mentioned previously, the smooth muscle–relaxing effects of bilberry extract have been put to good use in the treatment of dys- menorrhea.33 A significant improvement in pelvic-lumbosacral pain, mammary tension, nausea, and lower-limb heaviness was noted when women with dysmenorrhea were given bilberry extract (115 mg antho- cyanosides per day) for 3 days before and during menstruation. Bilberry extracts have demonstrated antiulcer effects in various experimental models and have been promoted as an ulcer medication in Italy.69

## Summary of Clinical Applications

V. myrtillus anthocyanosides exhibit significant pharmacological activ- ity, particularly on collagen structures. Research has demonstrated a positive effect in the treatment of the following problems: • Capillary fragility • Blood purpuras • Various encephalic circulation disturbances • Venous insufficiency • Varicose veins • Microscopical hematuria caused by diffuse and kidney capillary fragility • Poor night vision • Hemeralopia • Diabetic retinopathy Experimental studies indicate that anthocyanosides should also be useful in most inflammatory or degenerative conditions involv- ing connective tissues (e.g., osteoarthritis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease) as well as in glaucoma, diabetes, cataracts, retinal degeneration, and schizophrenia.


The standard dose for V. myrtillus is based on its anthocyanoside con- tent, as calculated from its anthocyanidin percentage. Widely used pharmaceutical preparations in Europe are typically standardized for a 25% anthocyanidin content. Dosages are as follows: • Anthocyanosides (calculated as anthocyanidin): 20 to 40 mg three times a day • V. myrtillus extract (25% anthocyanidin content): 80 to 160 mg three times a day • Fresh berries: 55 to 115 g three times a day


Extensive toxicological investigation has demonstrated that V. myrtil- lus anthocyanoside extracts are devoid of toxic effects. Administration to rats of dosages as high as 400 mg/kg has no apparent side effects, and excess levels are quickly excreted through the urine and bile.18,26


No drug interactions have been reported for V. myrtillus.

receptors and are either taken up or metabolized. A neuromodulator such as adenosine is more likely to be either constitutively released or released at times of high or low metabolic activity. Neuromodulators may act presynaptically or postsynaptically and may then be either taken up or metabolized. The stimulant properties of the methylx- anthines (caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, etc.) are partially explained by their antagonism of adenosine receptors. In contrast, valerian has been shown to act as an adenosine agonist.11


The primary clinical application for valerian is as a sedative in the treatment of insomnia. It can also be used in the treatment of stress and anxiety.

## Insomnia

More than 20 double-blind clinical studies have now substantiated valerian’s ability to improve sleep quality and relieve insomnia.12–23 Most of these studies have shown positive results.24 Several recent double-blind studies have shown no significant benefit with valerian in improving sleep parameters in insomnia. In one study, a dosage of mg valerian extract failed to show any statistically significant difference versus a placebo after a single dose or after 2 weeks of nightly dosing on any measure of sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and self-rated sleep quality.25 In another very detailed clinical study, standardized sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) and psychomet- ric tests were used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of valerian extract 300 mg, valerian extract 600 mg, or placebo.26 Results showed no sig- nificant effect between valerian 300 mg, valerian 600 mg, or placebo on any EEG parameter or psychometric measure. Nonetheless, these results are not viewed as being conclusive, given the results of other trials and valerian’s long history of use.24 The initial studies were performed on subjects who did not have insomnia. These studies showed quite clearly that extracts of valerian root improved subjective ratings of sleep quality and sleep latency (the time required to go to sleep) but left no “hangover” the next morn- ing.12 In one early study, the effects of valerian on sleep were studied in two groups of healthy young subjects.13 One group slept at home and the other in a sleep laboratory. Sleep was evaluated on the basis of questionnaires, self-rating scales, and nighttime motor activity. Under home conditions, both doses of an aqueous valerian extract (450 and 900 mg) reduced perceived sleep latency and wake time after sleep onset. Nighttime motor activity was enhanced in the middle third of the night and reduced in the last third. The data suggest a dose-depen- dent effect. In the sleep laboratory, where only the higher dose of vale- rian was tested, no significant differences from placebo were obtained. However, the directions of the changes in the subjective and objective measures of sleep latency and wake time after sleep onset, as well as in nighttime motor activity, corresponded to those observed under home conditions. There was no evidence of a change in sleep stages or EEG spectra. The results indicate that the aqueous valerian extract exerts a mild sedative effect. Although the initial studies demonstrated that valerian could improve sleep quality in normal subjects, they failed to answer the question of whether valerian can improve sleep patterns in people suf- fering from insomnia. In a follow-up to these two preliminary stud- ies, in more than 15 double-blind studies, valerian extract has been shown to significantly reduce sleep latency, improve sleep quality, and reduce nighttime awakenings in sufferers of insomnia.14 These stud- ies were usually performed under strict laboratory conditions and demonstrated quite clearly that valerian is as effective in reducing sleep latency as are small doses of barbiturates or benzodiazepines. However, although the latter compounds also increase morning sleepiness, vale- rian usually reduces morning sleepiness. In one of the better-designed double-blind trials, patients 18 to years of age diagnosed with nonorganic insomnia, according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, were treated at night with either 600 mg of valerian extract or 10 mg of oxazepam (Serax) for 6 weeks.17 A total of 202 outpatients with a mean duration of insomnia of 3.5 months at baseline were involved in the study. Sleep quality after 6 weeks measured by Sleep Questionnaire B showed that the 600-mg dose of valerian extract was at least as efficacious as a treat- ment with 10 mg of oxazepam. Both treatments markedly increased sleep quality compared with baseline (P < 0.01). The other sleep func- tion subscales—feeling of refreshment after sleep, psychic stability in the evening, psychic exhaustion in the evening, psychosomatic symp- toms in the sleep phase, dream recall, and duration of sleep—confirmed similar effects of both treatments. The Clinical Global Impressions scale and Global Assessment of Efficacy completed by investigators and patients again showed similar effects of both treatments. No significant side effects or serious adverse reactions were reported in either group. Most patients assessed their respective treatment as very good (82.8% in the valerian group, 73.4% in the oxazepam group). These results show that valerian extract displays a comparable efficacy with that of 10 mg of oxazepam in the therapy of nonorganic insomnia. In another study comparing the effects of valerian and oxazepam, 75 patients with nonorganic and nonpsychiatric insomnia between and 70 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either 600 mg of valerian extract or 10 mg of oxazepam every day 30 minutes before going to bed over a period of 28 days. The results of this study were consistent with those of the other in that both groups’ measures of sleep quality improved significantly, but there was no statistically sig- nificant difference between groups.22 Valerian extract has also been shown to help improve sleep and relieve insomnia in people withdrawing from chronic benzodiazepine use.18 The study consisted of patients with insomnia who complained of poor sleep despite long-term use of benzodiazepines. These patients had taken benzodiazepines nightly for an average of 7 years. The sleep electroencephalograms of the patients were analyzed with period ampli- tude analysis and associated algorithms during chronic benzodiazepine use (night 1) and then after 15 days of a valerian-placebo trial (initiated after washout of benzodiazepines; night 2). The subjects given valerian extract reported significantly better subjective sleep quality than those given placebo. The EEG results also showed significant less wake time after sleep onset in valerian subjects than in placebo subjects, and the valerian-treated patients experienced longer sleep latency and increased alpha counts in slow-wave sleep. Taken together, these results indicate that valerian extract has a positive effect on withdrawal from benzodi- azepine use. Valerian may be helpful in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS). In one study,27 patients with RLS were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of valerian extract or placebo for 8 weeks. The results indicated that valerian supplementation for 8 weeks improved symp- toms of RLS and decreased daytime sleepiness.28 Valerian extract also appears to be useful in children. Serious sleep disturbances are particularly problematic for children with intellectual deficits and are often the source of much distress for both the chil- dren and caregivers. Conventional drugs are not suitable for long-term treatment, making valerian an attractive alternative. In one small dou- ble-blind study in five children with varying intellectual deficits and different primary sleep problems, treatment with valerian extract led to significant reductions in sleep latencies and nocturnal time awake, lengthened total sleep time, and improved sleep quality.19 The treat- ment was apparently most effective in children with deficits that

involved hyperactivity. Although the findings were preliminary and are in need of replication, the results imply that valerian may be useful in the safe and effective long-term treatment of sleep difficulties in chil- dren with intellectual deficits. One of the major advantages of valerian extract is that it rarely has a negative effect on reaction time, alertness, or concentration the morning after intake. In one double-blind trial, 102 male and female volunteers were studied to determine whether reaction time, alert- ness, and concentration might be impaired by treatment with a vale- rian root extract.29 The effect was first examined the morning after a single evening dose of either valerian extract (600 mg), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) (1 mg), or a placebo and then after 2 weeks of evening administration of valerian extract (600 mg) or a placebo. Evaluation of the primary criterion (the median of reaction time measured with the Vienna Determination Test) and secondary criteria (alertness test, tracking test, sleep quality, additional Vienna Determination Test parameters, and safety criteria) all demonstrated that neither a single administration nor 14 days of valerian extract treatment produced an impairment in reaction abilities, concentration, or coordination.

## Anxiety and/or Depression

Valerian extracts, based on preliminary studies, have shown some evi- dence of usefulness in the treatment of generalized anxiety and depression. For example, in one study involving 36 outpatients with generalized anx- iety disorder, patients underwent a 2-week washout period and then were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments for 4 weeks: valepotriates (mean daily dose: 81.3 mg), diazepam (Valium) (mean daily dose: 6.5 mg), and placebo.30 Although no significant difference was observed among the three groups at baseline or in the change from baseline on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale—probably because of the small sample size in each group—there was some evidence of benefit nonethe- less. Specifically, only the diazepam and valepotriates groups showed a significant reduction in the psychic factor of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. In one study, valerian extract was shown to be effective in reducing the physiological effects of psychological stress induced under labo- ratory conditions in a group of healthy volunteers.31 Valerian extract produced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure responsivity, no significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure, and a decrease in the heart-rate reaction to mental stress. Valerian may prove useful in relieving anxiety in patients with comorbid depression. In an open clinical trial, the combination of valerian with St. John’s wort was found to improve symptoms more quickly than did St. John’s wort monotherapy.32 The combination therapy was well tolerated, and no significant side effects occurred. Valerian was also shown to be effective in reducing anxiety in a double-blind clinical trial in 64 infertile women undergoing hystero- salpingography, indicating that valerian can be effective in situational anxiety.33

## Menopausal Symptoms

Valerian may be helpful during menopause to help with both insom- nia and hot flashes. In regard to the later, two controlled clinical tri- als have shown benefit.34,35 In the first double-blind clinical trial, 76 menopausal women with the chief symptom of hot flashes were enrolled, with the treatment group receiving a 225-mg valerian capsule three times per day and the other group receiving a placebo, both for 8 weeks. After 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, the evaluation of results showed a meaningful difference between the valerian group and the placebo group. At week 4 and week 8 posttreatment, the valerian group had significantly less severe hot flashes (5.23 after 8 weeks) compared with the placebo group (9.86 after 8 weeks) as well as significantly fewer hot flashes compared with the placebo group, 4.83 versus 7.75, respectively.33


As a mild sedative, valerian may be taken 30 to 45 minutes before bed- time. This timing of dosage has been verified by pharmacokinetic stud- ies showing that the peak blood levels of valerenic acid occur within to 2 hours after ingestion. Dosage recommendations are as follows: • Dried root (or as tea): 1.5 to 3 g • Tincture (1:5): 4 to 8 mL (1–2 tsp) • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (1/2–1 tsp) • Solid (dry powdered) extract (4:1): 400 to 800 mg • Valerian extract (1.0%–1.5% valtrate or 0.5% valerenic acid): to 600 mg For the rare patient with increased morning sleepiness, reducing the dosage will eliminate the problem. For the best results, dietary fac- tors that disrupt sleep, such as caffeine and alcohol (see Chapter 187), should be eliminated.


Valerian is generally regarded as safe and is approved for food use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A major concern for any sedative or antianxiety medication is its potential to affect a person’s ability to drive or operate potentially dangerous machinery. Valerian at a one-time 1600-mg dose did not affect standardized field sobriety testing (SFST) and driving simulator performance parameters in a double-blind study.36 Another double-blind study evaluated the effect of a valerian–lemon balm preparation on psychomotor and mental performance tests.37 No effect was found on reaction time, concentration, or attentiveness. One case of valerian overdose has been reported in the literature.27 The patient presented with mild symptoms, all of which disappeared within 24 hours after the patient had taken an overdose—approx- imately 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose of valerian. Another case history reports valerian-induced hepatotoxicity.38


Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that valerian inhibits drug-metabolizing enzymes, at typical doses it is unlikely to produce clin- ically significant effects on the disposition of medications dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways of metabolism.39 There is some con- cern that valerian may prolong thiopental- and pentobarbital-induced sleep—a concern based on animal data and indicating the need to avoid concurrent use of valerian and barbiturates. Valerian was shown to significantly improve sleep and anxiety in HIV-positive patients taking the antiviral drug efavirenz.40

## 907CHAPTER 124 Viscum album (European Mistletoe)


V. album exhibits diverse pharmacological actions. The herb and vari- ous extracts have demonstrated that it serves as follows: • As a hypotensive • As a vasodilator • As a cardiac depressant • As a sedative • As an antispasmodic • As an immunostimulator • As an antineoplastic agent Purified mistletoe lectins are, in general, not as active in experi- mental studies as are crude preparations.11,12 Presumably, the crude preparations contain a number of compounds acting synergistically. It has also been proposed that alkaloid components are responsible for the maintenance of lectin structure and activity.5 During isolation and purification procedures, alkaloid linkages are cleaved from the lec- tins, resulting in a loss of specificity for target molecules. Unfermented Viscum preparations typically demonstrate greater direct cytotoxicity to tumor cells owing to higher concentrations of the viscotoxin mistle- toe lectin I (ML I).13–15

## Cardiovascular Effects

Viscum has exhibited a variety of effects on the cardiovascular sys- tem.3,16 In particular, Viscum has repeatedly demonstrated hypotensive action in animal studies. The mechanism of action for its hypotensive effect is still not entirely clear, and no recent investigations have been published. Viscum has been shown to inhibit the excitability of the vasomotor center in the medulla oblongata and to possess cholinomi- metic activity.16 Viscum’s hypotensive activity may depend on the form in which the mistletoe is administered and the host tree from which it was collected. Studies indicate that aqueous extracts are more effective; the highest hypotensive activity was demonstrated by a macerate of leaves of mis- tletoe parasitizing on willow and gathered in January.16 Viscum’s nonprotein components—flavonoids, phenol carbox- ylic acids, phenylpropanes, and lignins—have been shown to possess hypotensive action. Alcoholic solutions (tinctures and fluid extracts) contain these compounds but not viscotoxins or lectins. As previously stated, however, aqueous extracts appear to be more effective. Several Viscum preparations for hypertension are currently avail- able in Europe. In fact, in Great Britain alone, more than 150 differ- ent mistletoe preparations are available.3 These preparations typically have small amounts of Viscum in combination with other botanicals with hypotensive action, such as garlic, Crataegus oxyacantha, and Tilia platyphyllos.

## Antineoplastic and Immunostimulatory Effects

Viscum preparations have been used clinically in Europe for the treat- ment of cancer since 1926, when Iscador, a fermented product made from the crude pressed juice, was introduced as an immunotherapeu- tic agent for cancer. This work was carried out under the direction of Rudolph Steiner. Since that time, numerous studies have shown that Iscador and other Viscum preparations and components are effective antineoplastic and immunostimulatory agents.11–15,17–31 Iscador and other fermented Viscum preparations differ from non- fermented extracts in their greater effectiveness and their lower toxic- ity.17 Specifically, the major viscotoxin, ML I, is not found in Iscador.18 It is thought that fermentation transforms ML I to its A and B chains, which have important immunological properties.13 The A chain has mitogenic effects, and the B chain stimulates macrophages and the release of lymphokines. In addition, there is a rapid decrease of lectins during fermentation. The pharmacological activity of Iscador has been shown to be due to its Viscum components rather than to other constituents, such as lactobacilli, which possess adjuvant activity. The lectins have clearly been demonstrated to be the Viscum components largely responsible for Iscador’s adjuvant activity. Although unfermented plant juice has demonstrated tenfold-greater cytotoxicity to tumor cells than Iscador in vitro, fermented Iscador contains a great number of substances that may act synergistically. In vivo studies in mice have demonstrated Iscador to have greater adjuvant activity than purified mistletoe lectin and to be without secondary toxic effects.19,20 Viscum’s adjuvant activity is demonstrable in both delayed-type hypersensitivity and antibody responses of mice to sheep red blood cells.19,20 Like other adjuvants (e.g., bacille Calmette-Guérin, levami- sole, muramyl dipeptide, bacterial and yeast components, etc.), Iscador is most effective when it is administered near the tumor, although systemic administration has also yielded positive results. Upon local administration, an inflammatory process ensues that promotes white blood cell (WBC) infiltration and encapsulation of the tumor. The nonspecific host defense factors stimulated by Viscum include the following: • Enhanced macrophage phagocytic and cytotoxic activity17,20 • Increased neutrophil production17 • Increased thymic weight and enhanced cortical thymocyte activity and proliferation21,23 • Enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activity17,22,24,32 • Increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity17,22 • Inhibition of angiogenesis33 Iscador’s effects on these immunological parameters have been confirmed in patients with cancer.17,22 Iscador’s effect in stimulating the thymus gland has been demon- strated in several studies.21,23 Its ability to induce hyperplasia of the thymic cortex and accelerate the regeneration of hematopoietic cells after x-irradiation is much greater than that of any other agent reported to date.21 In addition, thymic lymphocytes became 29 times more responsive to concanavalin A as a result of Iscador administration. In summary, V. album exhibits numerous cytotoxic, adjuvant, and immunostimulatory effects that indicate a therapeutic effect in human

cancer. These effects have been confirmed in vivo against murine tumors, Lewis lung carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma 38, and C3H mammary adenocarcinoma 16/C.4


The clinical application with the most significant scientific documen- tation is the use of Viscum preparations as adjuncts in cancer therapy. In published studies, the route of administration of Viscum prepara- tions used has been subcutaneous or intravenous. Therefore it is not known to what degree (if any) the effects noted for Iscador as well as other preparations and Viscum compounds can be achieved with oral administration, although one study has shown that an enteric-coated, specially prepared Viscum preparation led to the absorption of intact lectins.34 Early clinical investigations of Iscador were not well documented. Owing to the shortage of acceptable controlled clinical trials, the use of Iscador and other Viscum preparations for the treatment of cancer in Europe has remained controversial, although positive effects in the postoperative treatment of lung, breast, colon, and cervical carcinomas have been shown in several controlled studies.25 The problem is that the methodological criteria in these studies are poor. Until their bene- fits are better documented, mistletoe preparations appear most useful as adjuncts to standard therapy. The results of a prospective study indicate that Iscador is helpful in increasing the survival rate for various cancers.35 The prospective long-term epidemiological study sought to determine whether Iscador treatment prolongs the survival time of patients with carcinoma of the colon, rectum, or stomach; breast carcinoma with or without axillary or remote metastases; or small cell or non–small cell bronchogenic carcinoma. A total of 10,226 patients with cancer were evaluated. Of these patients, 1668 had been treated with Iscador, and 8475 had taken neither Iscador nor any other mistletoe product (control patients). In the nonrandomized matched-pair study, the survival time of patients treated with Iscador was longer for all types of cancer studied. In the pool of 396 matched pairs, mean survival time in the Iscador groups (4.23 years) was roughly 40% longer than in the control groups (3.05 years). Perhaps even more beneficial than Iscador is the new generation of mistletoe preparations standardized on ML I (e.g., Eurixor, Lektinol). This greater standardization offers significant advantages. ML I is a potent inducer of cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor. Its cytotoxic effects are also related to its ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death).26 In one study, the effect of Eurixor was examined in 40 patients with advanced carcinoma of the breast. Along with standard chemother- apy (vinblastine, epidoxorubicin, and cisplatin [VEC] regimen), patients were assigned to receive mistletoe (treatment group), and were given a placebo (control group).27 After the fourth cycle of che- motherapy, the treatment group had statistically significantly higher leukocyte levels (P < 0.001) than the control group; the treatment group had an average WBC count of 3000/mm3, and the control group had an average WBC count of 1000/mm3. Furthermore, the param- eters of quality of life and anxiety revealed significantly better values in the treatment group than in the control group. These results show that adjuvant treatment with mistletoe extracts, in this case Eurixor, is a valuable addition to standard chemotherapy for patients with advanced breast cancer. These results are important because advanced breast cancer carries a very poor prognosis. Similar results in better- designed studies have been shown with various Viscum preparations in advanced pancreatic, colon, and liver cancers.28,36–41 Detailed reviews of published studies with Viscum preparations indicate significant improvements in various quality-of-life parame- ters, such as coping, fatigue, sleep, exhaustion, energy, nausea, vomit- ing, appetite, depression, anxiety, ability to work, and emotional and functional well-being in general and, less consistently, in regard to pain, diarrhea, general performance, and side effects of conventional treatments.42,43 A study in ovarian cancer consisted of two randomized matched- pair substudies: The first substudy comprised 42 patients with ovar- ian cancer without distant metastases (Ovar) and 40 ovarian cancer patients with distant metastases (OvarRand). Patients were paired in random allocation to either Iscador or control. The second substudy comprised 150 patients with ovarian cancer without distant metas- tases (Ovar) and 124 ovarian cancer patients with distant metastases (OvarRand). Patients who had already received therapy with Iscador were matched by the same criteria to control patients. Increased sur- vival rates with Iscador were significant in OvarRand but not in Ovar in both studies.44 One study in 220 patients with late-stage pancreatic cancer com- pared the overall survival of patients receiving an extract of V. album or no antineoplastic therapy. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the pancreas were stratified according to a binary prognosis index, composed of tumor stage, age, and performance status, and were evenly randomized to subcutaneous injections of V. album extract or no antineoplastic therapy. The extract was administered in a dose-esca- lating manner from 0.01 mg up to 10 mg three times per week. Median overall survival was 4.8 for the group receiving the Viscum extract and 2.7 months for control patients (prognosis-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.49; p < 0.0001). Within the “good” prognosis subgroup, median overall survival was 6.6 versus 3.2 months, within the “poor” progno- sis subgroup, it was 3.4 versus 2.0 months, respectively. These results showed a significant and clinically relevant prolongation of overall sur- vival with the administration of V. album extract.45 In a study in 32 operated gastric cancer patients (stage Ib or II) treated with either 5-FU prodrug doxifluridine alone or in combina- tion with V. album extract, those in the Viscum group demonstrated improvement in white blood counts, reduced reported bouts of diar- rhea (7% vs. 50%), and improved quality-of-life scores.46 Presurgical treatment with Viscum preparations may help prevent the decreased NK cell activity associated with surgery. In a study of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing open tumor resection, patients were randomly assigned to either mistletoe infusion or no additional therapy. The NK cell activity of patients treated with mistle- toe extract did not change significantly during the course of the study, whereas the control patients’ NK cell activity decreased significantly after surgery (–44.4% at 24 hours).47

## Immune Support

The immune-enhancing effects of Viscum preparations may extend to conditions beyond cancer. For example, Iscador was shown to reduce the rate of recurrent respiratory infections (RRIs) in children 5 to years old living in areas exposed to the radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident.48 The dosage was two subcutaneous injections a week for 5 weeks. One year after a single-treatment course, the frequency of RRI relapses decreased by 75%. Furthermore, V. album therapy resulted in normalization of initial immune indices that were either below or above the normal ranges. This immunomodulatory effect was assessed by investigation of lymphocyte subsets, NK cell activ- ity, phagocytic and oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and antiviral activity of serum before and 1 week after treatment. Clearly, additional investigations into the pharmacology of V. album are needed. Specifically, it must be determined whether the

effects noted both in vitro and in vivo in animals as well as in patients receiving injectable Viscum preparations can be attained with oral administration. In addition, greater clarification is needed to deter- mine optimal Viscum preparations. What host tree should be selected for which condition? What is the optimal harvesting time? In what form should the Viscum be administered—crude herb, aqueous or alcoholic extract, fermented or nonfermented? Viscum is undoubtedly one of the most complex botanicals; current data suggest that the future medicinal use of V. album looks promising.


The standard historical dose of V. album, based on the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia,49 is as follows: • Dried leaves: 2 to 6 g (or by infusion) three times a day • Tincture 1:5 (45% alcohol): 1 to 3 mL three times a day • Fluid extract 1:1 (25% alcohol): 0.5 mL three times a day • Dried aqueous extract 4:1: 100 to 250 mg three times a day


V. album possesses significant toxicity. Historically, the berries have been regarded as being considerably more toxic than the leaves and stems despite the fact that they all contain similar toxic compounds. The berries are considered to be more toxic, probably because of the fatal poisonings of children who ingest the berries. Lethal doses of Viscum lectins administered by various routes to mice produce the following two types of toxicity: (1) a typical type characterized by death after 3 to 4 days with marasmus-like symp- toms and (2) an atypical type characterized by immediate death from respiratory paralysis.23 In mice, the dose that is fatal to 50% of the sub- jects (LD 50 ) is 32 mg (dry weight) per kilogram of body weight of the plant juice administered intraperitoneally.29 The LD 50 values of V. album, either orally administered or in extract form, have not yet been determined. As stated earlier, alcohol-based extracts contain virtually no Viscum proteins. This fact would imply significantly less toxicity with these preparations; however, it would also imply loss of activity because much of the pharmacology of Viscum relates to its protein content, especially its immune-enhancing activity. The toxicity of Korean mistletoe, Viscum album coloratum, appears to be lower than that of European mistletoe.30,31 This other species has also demonstrated anticancer effects, but they appear to be due to highly cytotoxic alkaloids rather than to lectins.5,30 Studies comparing Korean Viscum extracts with European extracts as well as their alkaloid components have demonstrated that the Korean mistletoe has greater activity in inhibiting cancer cells. In addition, fresh Korean mistletoe extracts exhibited greater activity than fermented extracts.5,30 Korean mistletoe may ultimately prove to be superior to European mistletoe.


There is some theoretical concern that mistletoe’s hypotensive effects might be additive with conventional antihypertensive drugs and that its immunostimulant effects could counter immunosuppressant drugs. However, there appear to be no clinical reports of such effects.

## 911CHAPTER 125 Vitamin A

12 mg. In 1980, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences adopted this recommendation, and the 1980 recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin A is stated in milligrams and retinol equivalents; in 2001 the RDAs were revised to today’s values (Table 125.1), which use μ g RAE (retinol activ- ity equivalent) instead of RE as the standard unit, with μ g RAE equiv- alent to μ g all-trans retinol. A distinction between dietary β -carotene and supplemental β -carotene was also made because the latter has much greater absorption as an oil. Thus the current accepted conversion is μ g RAE = μ g of all-trans retinol = μ g of supplemental all-trans β -car- otene = μ g of dietary all-trans β -carotene = μ g of other dietary provitamin A carotenoids (see Fig. 125.2).2

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Sources

The most concentrated sources of preformed vitamin A are liver, kid- ney, butter, whole milk, and fortified skim milk, whereas the leading sources of provitamin A are dark-green leafy vegetables (collards and spinach) and yellow-orange vegetables (carrots, sweet potatoes, yams, and squash) (Table 125.2). Ingestion of excessive amounts of liver— 2.7 to 11 kg/week—has been reported to cause hypervitaminosis A.4

# DEFICIENCY

Vitamin A deficiency may be due to inadequate dietary intake (primary deficiency) or to some secondary factor that interferes with the absorp- tion, storage, or transportation of vitamin A. Some factors known to induce a vitamin A deficiency are as follows: • Malabsorption due to bile acid or pancreatic insufficiency • Protein-energy malnutrition • Liver disease • Zinc deficiency • Abetalipoproteinemia • Poor conversion of β -carotene to vitamin A

marily found as retinyl palmitate in most animal livers, fortificants, and supplements. Of the approximately 50 provitamin A carot- enoids in plants, the common ones include α-carotene, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin. These forms of provitamin A carotenoids are often quantified in human serum. (From Tanumihardjo SA, Russell RM, Stephensen CB, et al. Biomarkers of nutrition for development (bond)-vitamin A review.

## Immune System Effects

Immune system abnormalities associated with a vitamin A deficiency include impaired ability to mount an effective antibody response, decreased levels of helper T cells, and alterations in the mucosal linings of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Vitamin A–deficient individuals are more susceptible to infectious diseases and have higher mortality rates. It appears that although a vitamin A deficiency may predispose an individ- ual to an infection, vitamin A stores are also severely depleted during the course of an infection. Thus a vicious cycle ensues. Infectious conditions associated with vitamin A deficiency include measles, chickenpox, respi- ratory syncytial virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and pneu- monia. Lower vitamin A levels have also been linked to asthma, at least in children, and may parallel pulmonary function in this population. Despite this association, supplementation has not yet shown to be of benefit.5–7

## Other Effects

Prolonged vitamin A deficiency results in the characteristic signs of follicular hyperkeratosis (buildup of cellular debris in the hair follicles, giving the skin a goose-bump appearance, which occurs most often on the back of the upper arm), night blindness, and a higher rate of infection. As the condition worsens, the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract also become affected, and the classic eye disease known as xerophthalmia due to vitamin A deficiency ensues. Even a mild vitamin A deficiency is associated with a significant rise in mortality. This association is extremely significant because vitamin A deficiency is particularly wide- spread in developing countries, especially in Asia, where as many as million children are found to have xerophthalmia each year.8 In 2009, the World Health Organization estimated that as many as 190 million preschool children and over 19 million pregnant women have a vita- min A deficiency, using serum retinol as a criterion.9 The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in developed countries is less recognized but may be more common than appreciated. For example, data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2008 suggest that more than 75% of those age 19 to 50 have an intake below guidelines.10

## Xerophthalmia

The term xerophthalmia is generally used to cover all the ocular mani- festations of vitamin A deficiency. Blindness is one of the most serious consequences of vitamin A deficiency. Although it rarely occurs in the United States, it is the major preventable cause of blindness in Asia. The xerophthalmia of vitamin A deficiency is staged as shown in Table 125.3. In an effort to prevent vitamin A deficiency in underdeveloped countries, large prophylactic doses (200,000 IU) are given by the World Health Organization to children every 6 months.

## Determination of Deficiency

The rapid dark adaptation test is perhaps the most sensitive of the currently available tests designed to determine vitamin A deficiency. Measurement of serum retinol levels is usually not useful because they may not drop until marked deficiency occurs. Retinol isotope dilution is the most sensitive test to measure vitamin A status, and although technically difficult to perform, it measures total body stores ranging from deficiency to hypervitaminosis. The MRDR test is less demand- ing to perform, and although more accurate than serum retinol levels, it cannot define vitamin A status above adequacy.3 Deficiency in the United States and other developed countries is usually secondary to malabsorption, liver disease, or proteinuria.

# METABOLISM

## Absorption

A variety of factors are known to influence the absorptive efficiency of vitamin A and carotenoids. Although retinol does not require bile acids to facilitate absorption, carotenoids do. Other factors that affect vitamin A and carotenoid absorption are as follows: • The presence of fat, protein, and antioxidants in food • The presence of bile and a normal complement of pancreatic enzymes in the intestinal lumen • The integrity of the mucosal cells The absorptive efficiency of dietary vitamin A is usually quite high (80%–90%), with only a slight reduction in efficiency at high doses. In contrast, dietary β -carotene’s absorptive efficiency is much lower (approximately 10%), and it diminishes rapidly with increasing dos- age. Carotene supplements are better absorbed than the carotenes from foods ( β -carotene has a roughly sixfold higher absorption as a supple- ment vs. dietary source.)11 Both retinyl palmitate and β -carotene are transferred to lipid droplets and mixed micelles; although β -carotene is unaltered at this stage, retinyl palmitate is hydrolyzed to retinol by enzymes that include pancreatic lipase (encoded by PNLIP; Fig. 125.3).

<!-- chunk -->

## Transformation in the Intestinal Mucosa

The majority of absorbed retinol is esterified with palmitic acid or another free fatty acid within the intestinal mucosal cells. To cross into the cytoplasm of the enterocyte, it is currently speculated that β -caro- tene’s uptake is facilitated by scavenger-receptor class B-type I (SR-BI) and CD36 molecule, although this mechanism is not well established. SR-BI also facilitates cholesterol, vitamin E, and vitamin K uptake. A number of additional enzymes are thought to be involved in the metabolism, transport, and ultimately the incorporation (along with triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters) into chylomicra, including cellular retinol-binding protein type II (CRBPII) and β -car- otene oxygenase 1 (BCO1), the primary enzyme involved in β -caro- tene cleavage (Fig. 125.4). Each chylomicron is transported through the lymphatic channels into the general circulation and eventually removed from the circulation by the liver.

## Transport, Storage, and Excretion

Upon reaching the liver, vitamin A is stored primarily in special peris- inusoidal lipocytes (Ito cells), which store 70% to 90% of liver vitamin A; the hepatocytes contain only a minor fraction of the total vitamin A stored in the liver. Although small amounts of vitamin A are found in most tissues (Table 125.4), more than 70% of the total body vitamin A content is stored in the liver.12 It is stored as a lipoglycoprotein complex

Proteins are involved, or hypothesized to be involved, in vitamin A (VA) metabolism within the lumen of the upper gastrointestinal tract. βC, β-carotene and all other provitamin A carotenoids; PLB1, phospholipase B; PNLIP, pancreatic lipase; PNLIPRP2, pancre- atic lipase-related protein 2; RET, retinol; RP, retinyl palmitate and all other retinyl esters. Proteins followed by a question mark have been hypothesized to be involved because RET and βC are not soluble in water, and thus nonmicellarized VA is assumed to be associated with proteins. A dotted arrow means the pathway is suspected to exist, but there is no evidence thereof yet.13 (From Borel P, Desmarchelier C. Genetic variations associated with vitamin A status and vitamin A Bioavailability. Nutrients. 2017;9(3):E246. PMID: Reproduced from an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Com- mons Attribution (CC BY) license [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/].) consisting of 96% retinyl esters and 4% unesterified retinol. At least two lipases are necessary for the mobilization of retinyl ester stores, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and patatin-like phospholipase domain-con- taining 3 (PNPLA3) protein. The retinyl esters are hydrolyzed by a tightly bound retinyl ester hydrolase, which transfers the released all-trans ret- inol to intracellular retinol-binding protein (RBP), which in turn binds to transthyretin (TTR) (Fig. 125.5).13 The bound retinol is then pro- cessed through the Golgi apparatus and secreted into the plasma, where it forms a reversible 1:1 molar complex with prealbumin.1,14 It is worth mentioning that a polymorphism in one of the lipases just mentioned, PNPLA3, has emerged as a robust link between an appar- ent vitamin A deficiency and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although many details regarding the precise role of this enzyme are still unknown, it appears that the I148M variant (rs738409, G allele) has limited lipase activity, leading to lower circulating retinol levels, par- ticularly among overweight individuals. Despite an apparent vitamin A deficiency (as measured by serum retinol), hepatic stellate cell reten- tion of retinol is increased, and along with increased production of tri- glycerides, this appears to drive the pathogenesis of NAFLD, as well as progression to steatohepatitis (NASH) and cancer.15 Furthermore, the at-risk allele has been linked to both NASH as well as low bone mineral density among adolescents and may be a causal factor.16 Adequate dietary protein, iron, and zinc are necessary for proper retinol mobilization. The half-lives of RBP and prealbumin are less than 12 hours, making them particularly likely to be deficient during pro- tein-calorie malnutrition or other situations in which protein metab- olism is abnormal. A zinc, iron, or vitamin E deficiency also severely impairs vitamin A metabolism because these nutrients function synergistically in many physiological processes of vitamin A metabo- lism (absorption, transport, and mobilization in particular).17,18 Retinol is transferred into the cell after RBP binds to a cell-surface receptor. The retinol is then quickly bound by cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) in the cell cytosol. Retinoic acid is metabolized differently from retinol. It is absorbed through the portal system and transported in the plasma bound to albumin. It does not accumulate in the liver or other tissues in any appreciable amounts. It is metabolized quite rapidly to more polar oxygenated compounds. Intracellularly, it is bound to the cellular reti- noic acid–binding protein. Vitamin A metabolites are excreted mainly through the feces (via the bile) and the urine. During periods of deficiency, there appears to be an adaptation in utilization, as evidenced by a reduction in the rate of vita- min A catabolism.1,14 Indeed, blood levels of retinol are tightly regulated, with fasting concentrations ranging from 2 to μ M in adults).12

## Conversion of Beta-Carotene to Vitamin A

Emerging research is revealing genomic variations that result in impaired conversion of β -carotene to vitamin A are surprisingly common. Single- nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified that result in decreased activity of 15,15 ′ -monooxygenase, the key enzyme responsible for the conversion of β -carotene to retinol. The R267S (rs12934922) and A379V (rs7501331) variants are common, with frequencies in the pop- ulation of 42% and 24%, respectively. Of these two variants, the latter appears to have a greater effect; those with at least one copy of the less common allele have a 32% drop in activity (presumably more among homozygotes). Those with both 267S and 379V have a 57% reduction in

<!-- chunk -->

## 914SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

conversion rate. Those with these variants have increased blood levels of β -carotene and decreased blood levels of vitamin A.19 This may be especially concerning among groups with a low intake of preformed vitamin A, such as vegans. A review of dietary intake among Western industrialized nations found that approximately 35% of vitamin A intake is via carotenoids, although individuals who consume only one component (preformed vitamin A, or carotenoids alone) are unlikely to reach a recommended intake, a concern exacer- bated by poor conversion.20

# PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF VITAMIN A

<!-- chunk -->

## Vision

The best-understood physiological role of vitamin A is its effects on the visual system. The human retina has four kinds of vitamin A–containing photopigments. Rhodopsin, maximum absorption at 498 nm, is present in the rods. The three iodopsins, as follows, are in the cones: • Blue cones (maximum absorption 420 nm) • Green cones (maximum absorption 534 nm) • Red cones (maximum absorption 563 nm) The vitamin A form found in these pigments is the 11-cis isomer of vitamin A aldehyde (retinal). When a photon of light strikes the dark- adapted retina, the 11-cis configuration is converted to the all-trans form of the retinaldehyde and split from the rhodopsin molecule to yield opsin and all-trans retinol. This leads to a change in membrane potential and subsequent visual excitation. During light adaptation, because the visual processes largely depend on the cone cells, the released all-trans retinal or retinol from the rod cells is transported to pigment epithelial cells and stored as retinyl palmitate. During dark adaptation, these processes are reversed, and the retinal is isom- erized to the 11-cis form. The rod cells are particularly sensitive to vitamin A deficiency, so night blindness or poor dark adaptation is an early consequence of vitamin A deficiency. This sensitivity may have clinical significance in older adults with normal retinal health or early age-related maculopathy (ARM). In a double-blind, placebo- controlled experiment, 104 adults 50 years of age or older whose fundic photographs for the eye fell within steps 1 to 9 of the Age- Related Eye Disease Study Grading System were randomly assigned to a 30-day course of 50,000 IU oral retinol or a placebo. At 30 days, the retinol intervention group had significantly larger (i.e., steeper) rod slopes, indicating faster recovery of sensitivity, than did the placebo group. It is believed that the structural changes in the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch’s membrane in aging and early ARM cause a localized vitamin A deficiency.14 Despite this finding, the link between intake of vitamin A (as well as β -carotene) and macular drusen (a

## Growth and Development

Vitamin A is believed to affect growth and development through its necessary role in the synthesis of many glycoproteins (e.g., mucus), some of which may control cellular differentiation, and by its function as CRBP in controlling gene expression.1 The adhesion between cells is apparently related to glycopro- tein synthesis, which is markedly depressed in vitamin A deficiency. Consequently, there is a loss of normal stimuli for cellular growth and differentiation during deficiency. CRBP is transferred directly into the nucleus and may function much like some of the steroid hormones. The effects of a vitamin A deficiency most readily seen at the cellu- lar level are in those differentiating tissues that have a rapid turnover rate—epithelial cells of the oral cavity, respiratory tract, urinary tract, and ducts of the secretory glands.1

<!-- chunk -->

## Development and Maintenance of Epithelial Tissue

The role of vitamin A and carotenoids in the development and mainte- nance of epithelial tissue cannot be overstated. Vitamin A status deter- mines whether mucin or keratin is synthesized in epidermal cells—the presence of adequate vitamin A results in mucin production, whereas a lack leads to hyperkeratinization of the skin, cornea, upper respira- tory tract, and genitourinary tract. Mucopolysaccharide synthesis also appears to depend on adequate vitamin A status.1,22

## Reproduction

The requirement of vitamin A for reproductive functions in higher animals has been known since 1922. Beta-carotene has also been reported to have a specific effect in fertility distinct from its role as a precursor to vitamin A.23–25 In bovine nutritional studies, cows fed β -carotene–deficient diets exhibited delayed ovulation and an increase in the number of follicular and luteal cysts.23,25 The corpus luteum has the highest concentration of β -carotene of any organ measured.25 The carotene cleavage activity changes with the ovulation cycle, with the highest activity occurring during the midovulation stage. It has been speculated that a proper ratio of carotene to retinol must be main- tained to ensure proper functioning of the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces progesterone; therefore inadequate corpus luteum function could have significant deleterious effects. Inadequate corpus luteum secretory function is one of the characteristic features of infertile and/or irregular menstrual cycles.26 Furthermore, an increased estrogen/progesterone ratio has been implicated in a variety of clinical conditions, including ovarian cysts, premenstrual tension syndrome, fibrocystic breast disease, and breast cancer.27 Because supplemental β -carotene given to cows significantly reduced (cid:43)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:86)

the incidence of ovarian cysts (42% in the control group vs. 3% in the β -carotene group), it may have a similar effect in humans.24,25 Another bovine condition that has benefited from higher levels of dietary β -car- otene is cystic mastitis.26 It appears that farmers have a greater appre- ciation of β -carotene than many nutritionists. Of course, there are significant financial reasons for this because the annual monetary loss from bovine mastitis in the United States has been estimated to be at least $1.5 to $2 billion, and ovarian cysts represent the major cause of infertility in cattle.

## Immune System

Vitamin A is absolutely essential to proper immune function. Vitamin A plays an essential role in maintaining the epithelial and mucosal sur- faces and their secretions. These parts of the immune system constitute a primary nonspecific host defense mechanism. Furthermore, vitamin A has been shown to stimulate and/or enhance numerous immune processes, including induction of antitumor activity, enhancement of white blood cell function, and an increased antibody response.28 These effects are not due simply to a reversal of vitamin A deficiency because many are further enhanced by (supposedly) excessive amounts of vita- min A. Retinol has also demonstrated significant antiviral activity and has prevented the immunosuppression induced by glucocorticoids, severe burns, and surgery. Some of these effects are probably related to vitamin A’s ability to prevent stress-induced thymic involution and promote thymic growth. The carotenes, which are better antioxidants, may turn out to be even more effective in protecting the thymus gland than vitamin A because the thymus gland is particularly susceptible to free radical and oxidative damage.


Adequate tissue vitamin A levels are vital for optimal health. In addi- tion, this nutrient can be used beyond its “physiological” role in the treatment of various conditions. Supplemental vitamin A is used pri- marily to enhance the immune system in viral illnesses and to treat numerous skin disorders. Natural vitamin A is available as either retinol or retinyl-palmitate. Absorption may be improved via micellization or emulsification. Micelliza- tion is the process of making the fat-soluble vitamin A into very small drop- lets (micelles) so that the material is dispersed in water. Emulsification is the process of suspending vitamin A in a colloidal mixture with another chemical (e.g., lecithin) so that it can mix with water. Despite manufacturers’ claims, it is important to remember that regular vitamin A is absorbed at a rate of 80% to 90%.

<!-- chunk -->

## Infections

As discussed previously, vitamin A is absolutely critical to a healthy, functioning immune system. Vitamin A–deficient individuals are more susceptible to infectious diseases in general but especially par- asitical and viral infections. Although vitamin A deficiency may pre- dispose an individual to an infection, vitamin A stores are severely depleted during an infection.

<!-- chunk -->

## Parasitical Infections

Vitamin A is critical not only to immune function but also to the integ- rity and function of the intestinal barrier. Hence vitamin A deficiency may be a predisposing factor for intestinal parasitical infections. In one study evaluating the effects of retinol on intestinal barrier function, growth, total parasites, and Giardia species infections in children in northeastern Brazil, 79 children received vitamin A 100,000 to 200,000 IU (n = 39) or placebo (n = 40) at enrollment and then again at 4 and months; they were followed for 36 months. Total intestinal parasitical, specifically new, infections were significantly lower in the vitamin A group compared with the control group; this outcome was accounted for entirely by significantly fewer new Giardia infections in the vitamin A group, indicating that adequate vitamin A stores may help prevent Giardia infections.29 In another study, the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the overall incidence of diarrheal disease and respiratory tract infections in children was evaluated in 188 children, aged 6 to 15 months, from periurban marginalized communities of Mexico City. The children were assigned to receive vitamin A (below 12 months of age, 20,000 IU retinol; at or above 12 months, 45,000 IU retinol) or a placebo every 2 months and were followed for up to 15 months. Vitamin A supple- mentation had no significant effect on the risk of overall diarrheal disease but reduced mild watery diarrhea (incidence rate ratio [RR] 0.69) and cough with fever (RR, 0.69). Vitamin A supplementation also decreased diarrheal disease during the summer (RR, 0.74), among nonstunted children (RR, 0.69) and among children from higher socioeconomic level households.30

## Measles

Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in many developing coun- tries. A number of well-designed studies have confirmed an effect first noted in 1932: vitamin A supplementation can significantly reduce infant mortality due to measles by at least 50%. Typically, the dosage of vitamin A in double-blind studies has been 200,000 to 400,000 IU administered only once or twice to replenish body stores.31,32 However, the benefit of vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of measles is not limited to developing countries. A study of well-nourished chil- dren in Long Beach, California, suffering from measles indicated that 50% were deficient in vitamin A.33 This finding supports the use of vitamin A supplementation even in the United States.

## Infants With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections

Wide-scale immunization programs have reduced the risk of mea- sles in children. However, vitamin A therapy appears appropriate for other childhood viral illnesses as well. One of the more common viruses is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common cause of severe respiratory disease in young children. Studies have shown that chil- dren with RSV have low serum levels of vitamin A. Furthermore, the lower the vitamin A level, the greater the severity of the disease, similar to the relation shown in measles. Because vitamin A supple- mentation diminishes the morbidity and death caused by measles, a group of researchers decided to determine vitamin A’s safety and absorption pattern in RSV as a first step in assessing its therapeutic effectiveness.34 Twenty-one children with a mean age of 2.3 months (range 1–6 months) with mild RSV infection were treated with 12,500 to 25,000 IU of oral micellized vitamin A. Baseline vitamin A levels were shown to be low; however, within 6 hours of administration of 25,000 IU but not 12,500 IU of vitamin A, normal levels were reestablished. Despite their young age, none of the children experienced any obvious signs or symptoms of vitamin A toxicity. Although the study was not designed as a therapeutic trial, the subjects receiving vitamin A had shorter hos- pital stays than children with a similar severity of illness who were not enrolled in the study. Although vitamin A supplementation is an attractive treatment of RSV infections because of its low cost, wide availability, and ease of administration, placebo-controlled trials have suggested that it may be of value only in the most severe cases. A placebo-controlled study of 180 children in Chile with RSV provided 50,000 to 200,000 IU of retinyl palmitate (according to age) within 2 days of admission.35 Supplementation resulted in no significant benefit except for those

children suffering from hypoxemia. These children experienced sub- stantial benefit, consisting of a more rapid resolution of tachypnea and shortening of their hospital stay from 9.3 to 5.5 days. Similar results were seen in a study involving hospitalized pediatric patients with non- specific upper respiratory infections.36

## Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may also benefit from vitamin A supplementation. One study showed that a vitamin A deficiency is quite common during human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV) infection and that vitamin A deficiency is clearly associated with a decreased level of circulating helper T cells, one of the hallmarks of AIDS.37 Analysis of vitamin A levels, helper T cells, and other blood parameters in individuals with HIV indicated that more than 15% had low serum vitamin A levels. Helper T-cell levels were much lower in patients with HIV infection whose vitamin A levels were low than in those who had normal levels of vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency was also shown to be associated with a higher rate of mortality due to HIV. Increasing β -carotene may be the preferred form of vitamin A for supplementation in patients with HIV because retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A, may actually increase HIV replication in humans. Low β -carotene levels are common in AIDS, presumably as a result of fat malabsorption. Low β -carotene levels are associated with greater impairment of immune function.38

## Skin Disorders

The use of high-dose vitamin A therapy for acne and other skin disor- ders was introduced in dermatology in the late 1930s. It is still used by a few dermatologists, although this type of therapy is not as popular as before the advent of synthetic retinoids. Vitamin A therapy has been shown to be quite effective in treating skin conditions associated with excessive formation of keratin (hyperkeratosis), a skin protein that can clog the pores of the skin to produce a “goose bump” effect. Examples of some skin conditions associated with hyperkeratosis include acne, psoriasis, ichthyosis, lichen planus, Darier’s disease, palmoplantar ker- atoderma, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. The dosages of vitamin A used to treat these conditions have typically been quite high (300,000–500,000 IU/day for 5–6 months in the treatment of acne; 1–3.5 million IU/day for 1–2 weeks for the other conditions).39–42 The use of these high dos- ages usually results in the development of significant toxicity (see later discussion). Although there is some evidence that carotenes may be more useful and less toxic in some of these conditions, the pharma- cological activity responsible for the effects of vitamin A in hyperkera- tosis is believed to occur when serum retinol levels exceed serum RBP capacity, causing destabilization of membranes and destruction of the keratin-producing cells.38 In monitoring for vitamin A toxicity, laboratory tests appear unre- liable until obvious toxicity symptoms are apparent. The first signifi- cant toxic symptom is usually headache, followed by fatigue, emotional instability, and muscle and joint pain. Chapped lips (cheilitis) and dry skin (xerosis) generally occur in the majority of patients, particularly in dry weather. Because high doses of vitamin A during pregnancy can cause birth defects, women of childbearing age should use effective birth control during vitamin A treatment and for at least 1 month after discontinuation. High doses of vitamin A may not be necessary if other nutritional factors, like zinc and vitamin E, are included. These nutrients work with vitamin A in promoting healthy skin. A safe and effective recom- mendation for vitamin A in the treatment of acne is less than 25,000 IU/day.

## Dry Eyes

Dry-eye disorders are a complex group of diseases characterized by a localized water deficiency in the tear ducts, a mucin deficiency, or a combination of the two. Despite the diversity of underlying causes, the changes in the conjunctiva of the eye are similar in all cases—loss of goblet cells (mucin-producing cells); abnormal enlargement of non- goblet epithelial cells; and increases in cellular layers, keratin deposi- tion and stratification, and keratinization. Apart from topical vitamin A therapy, all other nonsurgical ther- apies for dry eye (i.e., the frequent application of artificial tears, lubricants, or slow-releasing polymers and the therapeutic use of soft contact lenses) are not directed toward reversing the underlying pro- cess but, rather, toward alleviating the symptoms. The hypothesis that a localized vitamin A deficiency in the lining of the outer eye may be responsible for dry eye, based on vitamin A’s vital role in epithelial tissue, seems obvious. Clinical studies featuring commercial vitamin A eyedrops (Viva-Drops, Vision Pharmaceuticals, vivadrops.com, Mitchell, South Dakota) have yielded impressive clini- cal results in the treatment of dry eyes.43,44

## Emerging Potential Applications

It has long been recognized that both iodine and vitamin A deficiencies contribute to hypothyroidism, and their combined use may be more effective than either alone.45 A recent clinical trial conducted among premenopausal women suggests that retinyl palmitate (25,000 IU/ day) may reduce the risk of subclinical hypothyroidism—significant increases in T3 and decreases in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were found compared with placebo. More clinical data are needed before broad recommendations can be made, but this suggests a poten- tial for supplementation even without documented deficiency. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis, may prove to be valid applications of vitamin A therapy. One recent study found that a marginal vitamin A deficiency is more than twice as common as a vitamin A deficiency among the elderly, with lower levels associated with greater cognitive decline, pos- sibly by stimulating A β production and neuritic plaque formation.46 Evidence also indicates that patients with multiple sclerosis have lower plasma levels of vitamin A, which may lead to impaired immune tol- erance. Clinical trials (25,000 IU per day) with retinyl palmitate have shown improvement in the balance of Th1 and Th2 cells, as well as improvements in fatigue and depression.47,48


Dosage ranges for vitamin A reflect the intent of use. For general health purposes, a dosage of 5000 IU for men and 2500 IU for women appears reasonable. During an acute viral infection, a single oral dosage of 50,000 IU for 1 or 2 days appears to be safe even in infants (note that women who might be pregnant must not use vitamin A supplements; β -carotene, however, is fine). For the treatment of acne and hyperker- atotic skin disorders, high-dose therapy may be useful but should be monitored closely by a physician.


Vitamin A supplementation must be avoided during preg- nancy because large doses have been shown to be teratogenic. Unfortunately, safe dosages for pregnant women have not yet been determined, although combined human and animal data suggest that 30,000 IU/day should be considered safe.49 Nonetheless, women who may become pregnant should keep their supplemental vitamin A lev- els below 5000 IU or, better yet, switch to carotenes.50 (Emerging

research is showing that 20%–30% of the population is unable to convert β -carotene to vitamin A. The only way to know is by mea- suring blood levels.) Excess dietary intake of vitamin A has been associated with birth defects in humans in fewer than 20 reported cases over the past 30 years.51 Acute toxicity with vitamin A, which is most often seen in children as a result of the accidental ingestion of a single large dose of vitamin A (100,000–300,000 IU), manifests as follows: • Raised intracranial pressure with vomiting • Headache • Joint pain • Stupor • Occasional papilledema Symptoms rapidly subside upon withdrawal of the vitamin, and complete recovery always ensues. Vitamin A toxicity may occur in adults who have taken more than 50,000 IU/day for several years. Smaller daily doses may produce tox- icity symptoms if there are defects in the storage and transport of vita- min A, as occurs in cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, or protein-calorie malnutrition as well as in children and adolescents.52,53 Signs of vita- min A toxicity generally include the following: • Dry, fissured skin • Brittle nails • Alopecia • Gingivitis • Cheilosis • Anorexia • Irritability • Fatigue • Nausea Serum levels of vitamin A between 250 and 6600 IU/dL are typical of toxicity. Prolonged, severe hypervitaminosis A leads to bone fragility and thickening of the long bones. Toxicity is typically encountered during high-dose vitamin A ther- apy for various skin conditions. Although dosages smaller than 300,000 IU/day for a few months rarely cause toxicity symptoms, early recog- nition is still very important. Cheilitis (chapped lips) and xerosis (dry skin) generally appear in the majority of patients, particularly in dry weather. The first significant toxicity symptom is usually headache, fol- lowed by fatigue, emotional lability, and muscle/joint pain. Laboratory tests are of little value in monitoring toxicity because serum vitamin A levels correlate poorly with toxicity, and values of serum glutamic- oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase are elevated only in symptomatic patients.38 Prostate cancer risk may also be an area for toxicity concern. Serum retinol was recently associated with both total (odds ratio [OR] 1.3) and high-grade prostate cancer risk (OR 1.74) in the large nested case- control Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. The increase in risk appeared to be limited to men with a for-cause biopsy and those who reported supplement use, suggesting that supplemental vitamin A may be more of a risk factor than dietary sources.54 This is in agreement with one of the largest prospective studies to date, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta- Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, as well as a large pooled analysis of nearly 11,000 cases, both of which found associations between serum retinol and prostate cancer risk, with either no effect or a protective association with carotenoids such as lycopene and β -carotene.55,56


Vitamin E and zinc are particularly important to the proper function of vitamin A. A deficiency of zinc, vitamin C, protein, or thyroid hormone will impair the conversion of provitamin A carotenes to vitamin A. Excessive vitamin A intake can inhibit vitamin D–mediated cal- cium absorption, accelerate bone loss, and inhibit the formation of new bone.57,58 All of these actions may raise the risk of osteoporo- sis and hip fracture. In one prospective study, a vitamin A intake greater than 5000 IU/day, compared with a lower intake, was asso- ciated with a reduction in bone mineral density that approximately doubled the risk of hip fracture.59 However, a recent long-term study that enrolled 663 men and 335 women taking either retinol (7.5 mg RE/d) or beta-carotene (30 mg/d) found no increase in risk for osteoporotic fracture, suggesting this relationship needs more data, although compelling evidence suggests that only in the context of vitamin D deficiency does vitamin A pose a risk for osteoporosis.60,61 Studies have demonstrated a link between exposure to toxic chem- icals and vitamin A nutrition. Administration of compounds such as polybrominated biphenyls, dioxin, and other toxic chemicals to rats leads to a decrease in the hepatic content of vitamin A. Concurrent administration of vitamin A and the xenobiotics partially prevents the symptoms of toxicity. Exposure to these compounds results in an increased vitamin A requirement because of the enhanced degradation of vitamin A in the liver.62,63

mcg/100 g food) in certain vegetables, vegetable oils, seeds, algae, and in small amounts (<50 mcg/100 g food) in the rest of the vegetable and animal foods, as listed in Fig. 126.2. Table 126.1 lists the typical yield of vitamin K 1 in common measures of select vegetables, which are the most significant sources of vitamin K 1 of all vegetable foods. Vitamin K 1 is also available for oral or intramuscular injection to cor- rect clotting deficiency in newborns or to compensate for anticoagulant overdose in adults. Studies are conflicting in regard to the concern that vitamin K 1 injection may increase the risk of various cancers, including leukemia in infants. Recent research seems to have established that the risk was related to the route of administration, specifically to injection and not via the oral route. Also, the safest and most reliable way to increase vitamin K 1 in the unborn fetus and reduce the risk of bleeding after birth seems to be by increasing the mother’s vitamin K status, as some studies suggest.5

## Absorption

Absorption of vitamin K 1 varies considerably depending on its source. When it is delivered in a vegetable, its bioavailability is low (3%–10%) because it is trapped in the chloroplast.6 Cooking and/or mechanical processing (blending, juicing) of the vegetables or pressing the oil out of the vegetable seeds (such as sunflower seeds) increases the vitamin’s bioavailability and absorption up to as much as 50% compared with the raw vegetable.7 By adding dietary fat to the vitamin K 1 -containing food, absorp- tion of the vitamin can be doubled; it may then reach 10% to 15%.8 Following is a summary of estimated vitamin K 1 absorption values, obtained by comparing a number of studies9–17: • Absorption from raw vegetables (such as spinach or broccoli): 3% to 5%; some suggest as high as 10% • Absorption from cooked vegetables without fat: some have found no difference compared with raw vegetables • Absorption from cooked vegetables with fat: approximately 2.5 times the absorption from raw vegetables • Absorption from vitamin K 1 dissolved in vegetable oil: approxi- mately 50% to 80% • Absorption from a synthetic vitamin K 1 supplement: approximately 10% (if mixed in a capsule with 85% cellulose) and approximately 80% (if mixed in an emulsion containing lecithin and a bile acid) Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light inactivates vitamin K. When oils containing vitamin K 1 are hydrogenated (during industrial processing, cooking, frying, or baking), a big percentage (40%–50%) of the vita- min K 1 content is also hydrogenated. Studies have shown that hydro- genated vitamin K 1 has very little biological activity.18 It is important to note that a large section of the population derives a majority of its vitamin K 1 from vegetable oils as opposed to vegetables, so the effect of vitamin K inactivation by hydrogenation may have an important effect on common deficiencies of vitamin K, which may be higher than estimated from just vitamin K 1 intake surveys.

## Transport, Metabolism, and Distribution in Human

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissues

Once ingested, vitamin K 1 can be metabolized through various routes in the body (see Fig. 126.2). Vitamin K 1 is transported initially in the chylomicrons through lymph and blood to the liver and other tissues. Once taken up by various tissues, vitamin K 1 may be stored and utilized unchanged, while part of it may be converted to K 2 (MK-4). For unclear reasons, the steady-state ratio of K 1 /K 2 (MK-4) stored in each tissue varies based on tissue type and from individual to individual. See Fig. 126.2 for a list of these ratios in various tissues and organs derived from an animal study.19 One study estimates that 5% to 25% of the absorbed vitamin K 1 , the same as various K 2 forms, is converted to K 3 in the intestinal cells.20 Various cells in the body may take up vitamin K 3 and convert it to vitamin K 2 (MK- 4). A portion of vitamin K 3 is converted to K 2 (MK-4) in each tissue.21 The unabsorbed fraction of vitamin K 1 is metabolized by certain types of gastrointestinal bacteria (Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, and Propionibacterium) and converted into vitamin K 3 or into vitamin K 2 (MK-n, n = 1–14), the most predominant forms being the longer- chains MK-7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. As a result of uptake in all the metabolic pathways described pre- viously, vitamin K 1 intake can lead to an increase of various forms of vitamin K in the body, as follows: vitamin K 1 in serum and tissues/ organs, vitamin K 3 especially in the serum, vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in tis- sues/organs, and long-chain K 2 s are typically stored in the liver. One study looked at the vitamin K stored in the rat brain in response to supplementation with either vitamin K 1 or vitamin K 2 (MK-4).20 Contrary to what was expected, the results showed that supplemen- tation with vitamin K 1 was able to increase the brain content of K 2 (MK-4) more than direct supplementation with vitamin K 2 (MK-4).

## Food sources, metabolism. Vitamin K

2 is not considered a vitamin in the true sense because theoretically it is not an essential nutrient. This is because animal and human tissues synthesize vitamin K 2 (MK-4) from the vitamin K 1 ingested, and intestinal bacteria can synthesize various long-chain K 2 s from it as well. Although there is an overlap in their carboxylating function, it is not clear whether any of the vitamin K 2 forms can perform all the functions that vitamin K 1 exerts, and there is no proof that they can convert into vitamin K 1 . Vitamin K 2 can be viewed as a metabolite of vitamin K 1 inside human/ animal tissues, but some researchers are calling it “the active form of vita- min K 1 .” Consequently, vitamin K 2 may be conditionally essential for cer- tain individuals owing to their genotypes, aging, and metabolic or disease conditions where the conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 is inadequate. Like the essential role of vitamin K 1 in the energy production (photo- synthesis) of plants or algae, vitamin K 2 is an obligatory component of the O O 3 O O H n – O O A B C

Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) is the most prevalent form of vitamin K in human and animal tissues, at about 90% of total vitamin K stored, with the remainder as mostly vitamin K 1 and small amounts of long-chain K 2 (MK-n)s (n = 7–11). The distribution of K 1 versus K 2 in tissues/organs was found to vary widely in an animal study, as shown in Fig. 126.2. The ratio of K 1 /K 2 (MK-4) stored varies based on relative and absolute intakes of various forms of vitamin K. Many studies have shown that various long-chain K 2 (MK-n)s are converted to K 2 (MK-4) in all tissues with the exception of the liver. For example, dietary supplementation of rats with a dose of K 2 (MK-7), equivalent to approximately 90 mcg in humans, was shown to result in a significant increase of K 2 (MK-4) in bone, whereas no

MK-7 was detected in the bone.23 However, another animal study reported that a fraction of supplemented K 2 (MK-7) is deposited as such in bone. However, this rat study used a dose equivalent to a human dose of 85 mg of K 2 (MK-7), which does not translate into practical applications.86 A substantial amount of long-chain K 2 [MK-n]s, n = 7 to 11 is stored in the liver unchanged, and this organ has a distinct distribution of vitamin K compared with all other tissues: that is, 90% long-chain menaquinones (K 2 [MK-n]s, n = 8–11) and 10% vitamin K 1 . This may be because the liver is the first organ to have access to the vitamin K 2 synthesized by the intestinal bacteria, which is absorbed through the lower ileum. This preferential sequestering of MK-ns in the liver is hypothesized to be an evolutionary adaptation for securing a low-turn- over vitamin K pool to support clotting needs and protect against the dietary variability of vitamin K 1 or K 2 (MK-4).

## Dietary Sources of Various Forms of Vitamin K


Dietary sources of various forms of vitamin K 2 (various menaqui- nones) include animal meats and dairy as well as fermented foods of animal or vegetable origin, as follows:

## Animal foods. Meats (2–3 mcg/100 g), egg yolk (10 mcg/one

egg), and milk. These sources preferentially provide the K 2 (MK-4) form along with similar amounts of vitamin K 1 . Table 126.2 contains a listing of the vitamin K 2 content of various foods. Table 126.2 lists the vitamin K 2 content of select foods from three studies in the United States, Holland, and Japan.25 The content of vitamins K 1 and K 2 in human milk depends on the mother’s intake of these vitamins.26 The same may be true for cow’s milk and other animal milks. Similarly, the vitamin K content of ani- mal tissues may be lower for animals fed mostly corn versus those that

are exclusively grass-fed, although no studies have measured this. The vitamin K 2 content of animal-derived food may be higher when they are supplemented with vitamin K 3 (a common practice). Because vita- min K 3 supplementation has proved detrimental for humans, it may be of questionable safety for animals. Also, continuous antibiotic treat- ment of the animals (to enhance growth) may impair their intestinal bacterial production of vitamin K 2 .

<!-- chunk -->

## Fermented foods (animal or vegetable). Various forms of

vitamin K 2 are produced by certain bacteria, ranging from K 2 (MK-4) to K 2 (MK-12) (see Table 126.2): 1. Animal origin: cheese and other fermented milk products (yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, sour cream) provide vitamin K 2 forms mostly as K 2 (MK-8) and K 2 (MK-9). 2. Vegetable origin: natto, sauerkraut, kimchi. For example, the bac- teria specific to natto (a fermented mix of soybeans and rice) will provide vitamin K 2 mostly in the K 2 (MK-7) form; bacteria in foods like sauerkraut (pickled cabbage) provide vitamin K 2 in a wide vari- ety of forms, such as K 2 (MK-5) through K 2 (MK-9).


<!-- chunk -->

## Produced by Human Intestinal Bacteria

Certain bacteria residing in the human intestinal tract convert the ingested vitamin K 1 or other dietary components (such as alpha-keto- glutarate) to various forms of vitamin K 2 (MK-n). The types of bacteria that have this property are mostly gram-negative, such as Bacteroides fra- gilis, Propionibacterium, and particular strains of E. coli (normal gastro- intestinal resident strain, not necessarily pathogenic). Certain strains of Lactobacillus were also found to produce vitamin K 2 , although these are not the commonly known strains of Lactobacillus or probiotics used in supplements or found in yogurt. Vitamin K produced by the gut bacteria may represent a significant portion of the total vitamin K 2 acquired by some people if their vitamin K status is marginal.27


<!-- chunk -->

## Absorption and Transport

Very few studies have evaluated the absorption of various forms of vitamin K 2 .28 One study found that absorption of K 2 (MK-4) was 16%, 21%, 44%, and 44% with meals containing 8 g, 20 g, 35 g, and 45 g fat, respectively. One study administered K 2 (MK-7) from a natto extract and claimed to have obtained “almost complete” absorption, whereas the absorption of K 2 (MK-7) derived from a supplement was 78% of that from natto. Vitamins K 2 (MK-4) and K 2 (MK-7) are believed to be partially cleaved (around 5%–25%) in the intestinal wall to form vitamin K 3 , which was found in the urine 2 to 3 hours after ingestion of these vitamers. Plasma half-life of a one-time administration of K 2 (MK-4) is around 1 to 2 hours, whereas that of K 2 (MK-7) is around 2 days. Some hypoth- esize that K 2 (MK-4) is taken up by the tissues a lot faster because it is the preferred storage form of vitamin K 2 . However, after 4 weeks of supplementation with 1.5 mg K 2 (MK-4), for example, fasting plasma levels of K 2 (MK-4) increased from 0.2 ng/mL to 1.5 ng/mL.184 Table 126.3 shows the average intakes of various forms of vitamin K from an epidemiological study in a Dutch population. The particularly high contributions from MK-9 and MK-8 are known to be a result of cheese consumption, whereas MK-4 is derived mostly from meat and eggs.

Vitamin K 2 is currently available as a supplement in three forms: 1. Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) (menaquinone-4 or menatrenone), which is provided in a synthetic version. It is typically available in doses in

the range of 40 to 50 mcg, 1 mg, 15 mg, or 45 mg in stand-alone vitamin K formulas, vitamin D combination with vitamin K for- mulas, or bone-specific formulas. It is also available as a prescrip- tion medication in Japan, called Glakay, in 15-mg doses (with the indication of three times daily).29 2. Vitamin K 2 (menaquinone-7, MK-7) is available either in a synthetic version or as a product of fermentation. It can, of course, be ingested with the natto food itself, which provides an average of 1000 mcg/100 g serving. The average vitamin K 2 intake found in young Japanese women was 61.7 mcg. From this, K 2 (MK-7) typically represents 57.4 mcg owing to the common consumption of natto. 3. A blend of three menaquinones (MK-6, MK-7, MK-9), a product of fermentation.

## Occurrence, Properties, and Special Considerations for

## Animal and Human Consumption

Vitamin K 3 (menadione) has not been observed to occur in natural foods in any significant amount. It is believed to be formed inside intestinal cells and possibly other tissues and organs of humans and animals and can be found in the plasma and urine 2 to 3 hours after ingestion of either vitamin K 1 , K 2 (MK-4), or K 2 (MK-7). Certain intestinal bacteria can convert the ingested vitamin K 1 to K 3 or de novo synthesize vitamin K 3 from compounds such as alpha-keto-glutarate. Vitamin K 3 is not a vitamin in the true sense; initially it was synthe- sized to be used as an oral provitamin K compound, most likely because of its conversion to vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in human and animal tissues. Vitamin K 3 may have been chosen as a supplement because it is a much simpler molecule to synthesize than vitamins K 1 or K 2 ; thus it was less expensive to produce. However, oral consumption of vitamin K 3 was banned in humans when various side effects were noticed, such as increased red blood cell lysis, excessive oxidative stress, and non- specific binding of thiols from large and small molecules in the blood. However, the cytotoxic effects of vitamin K 3 were recognized as useful in support of cancer treatment, alone or in addition to chemo- therapy, and K 3 has been used in the oral and intravenous forms (dis- cussed later) in research studies involving humans. Vitamin K 3 is not currently available as a drug or supplement for human use. It is important to keep in mind that serum vitamin K 3 can rise sig- nificantly as a result of ingesting supraphysiological doses of vitamins K 1 or K 2 (above 1 mg), especially if given in one bolus. (This concern is discussed under “Potential Side Effects of High Doses of Vitamins K 1 , K 2 , and K 3 ”).

<!-- chunk -->

## Animal nutrition. Certain animal feeding practices include

synthetic vitamin K 3 as a supplement, probably because animals fed corn instead of grass receive little natural vitamin K 1 . Vitamin K 3 is chosen because it costs significantly less than it would to add vitamin K 1 or incorporate foods naturally high in vitamin K 1 , such as grass. No studies have reported the content of vitamin K 3 in animal foods from animals supplemented with vitamin K 3 , and very few have reported the tissue content of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in these animals. There is at least a theoretical concern that these foods may contain abnormally high levels of vitamin K 3 owing to incomplete conversion to the normally occurring K 2 (MK-4). It is not clear whether organic meats come from animals fed vitamin K 3 , because they get plenty of vitamin K 1 from the grass.

## Mechanisms of Action of Vitamins K


<!-- chunk -->

## and K


Aside from blood clotting support, new research is revealing numerous roles for vitamin K in many tissues and organs through a variety of mechanisms. Vitamin K’s actions in human physiology are very complex: 1. Posttranslational modification (through carboxylation) of a num- ber of functional proteins, called vitamin K-dependent proteins (VDKs) 2. Modulation of inflammation through downregulation of cytokine IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) (by inhibiting COX-2) 3. Downregulation of cell signaling proteins (produced downstream of mevalonate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA]), which affect cell differentiation, proliferation, or apoptosis 4. Neurological effects through modulation of galactocerebroside sul- fotransferase enzyme 5. Genetic expression modulation. K 2 (MK-4) stimulates the steroid and xenobiotic receptor, which upregulates expression of bone blastic proteins and collagen. 6. Anticancer effects Vitamin K activates a variety of VKDs throughout the body by car- boxylating a specific number of the glutamatic acid residues they con- tain, which become, as a result, gamma-carboxyglutamate residues, also called Gla. One molecule of vitamin K 1 or K 2 can be recycled many times, so it is used multiple times to produce Gla residues before it is metabolized for elimination (Fig. 126.3). Once carboxylated, these residues can bind calcium or interact with cell membranes more efficiently. The more glutamate residues are car- boxylated on a VKD protein, the better its functionality. Ultimately, the more vitamin K is available in the body, the higher the percentage of fully carboxylated VKDs will be. Until now, the AI (adequate intake) for vitamin K has been defined as the amount needed to completely carboxylate prothrom- bin. With the discovery of new roles for various VKDs throughout the body, many researchers are now proposing redefining the AI at a level where all VKDs in the body are 100% carboxylated. A review by

## 925CHAPTER 126 Vitamin K

McCann and Ames points out that vitamin K affinity varies greatly for each type of VKD, which may influence the order in which VKDs are carboxylated. Most likely, this is done in an order of physiological priority, selected by evolutionary pressure for survival.30 For example, clotting may have the highest priority in utilizing most of the vitamin K ingested when intake is around or below 100 mcg/day. In this sit- uation, most of the other VKDs in the body will tend to be inade- quately carboxylated and so have poor functionality. Unfortunately, there are no tests to verify the carboxylation of all the known VKDs except for the three that will be discussed (protein induced by vita- min K antagonist-II [PIVKA II], osteocalcin, and matrix GLA protein [MGP]). Important cofactors affecting the rate of carboxylation of VKDs are manganese and vitamin B 6 , specifically pyridoxal-5-phos- phate. Deficiency of these cofactors, as well as that of estrogen and thyroid hormone may downregulate carboxylation, whereas supple- mentation with pyridoxal-5-phosphate was shown in vitro to upreg- ulate it twofold. Osteocalcin is a protein produced by osteoblasts (bone-build- ing cells) that transports calcium inside the bone for fixating it in the hydroxyapatite structure, thus supporting bone mineralization. Vitamin K has been shown to stimulate osteoblasts to increase their production of osteocalcin and collagen type I, both important compo- nents of the bone structure. Increased levels of osteocalcin are able to better support bone remodeling and thus improve bone architecture, which translates into better bone elasticity and thus reduced risk of fracture.31–33 Osteodentin (tooth dentin) is responsible for tooth mineralization, similar to osteocalcin’s role in the bone.34 Note that the salivary gland concentrates a significant amount of vitamin K, which may have a role in supporting oral health. Vitamin K is known to affect certain bacte- ria by participating as a cofactor in their energy production (similar to coenzyme Q10 in animal mitochondria). If it is in fact proved that salivary glands secrete vitamin K, this would affect oral bacteria; one researcher has stated that excess vitamin K may exacerbate periodontal disease.35 Nephrocalcin is found in kidney tissue and is believed to support calcium ion solubilization and inhibit crystal nucleation, thus reducing the risk of kidney stones. Matrix Gla protein, or MGP, is found in many soft tissues, where it has at least one identified role, that of rejecting calcium deposition. Specifically, it is found in the skin and in the walls of arteries and veins, where it prevents the calcification of elastin fibers, thus reducing the risk of elasticity loss in these tissues. It is also found incorporated with underlying ground substance of the skin and cartilage (associated with chondrocytes), where it seems to play a role in the synthesis of glycos- aminoglycans.36 MGPs have also been identified in testes and sperm; their role there is not clear, but vitamin K deficiency has been shown to reduce testosterone production and sperm motility. One study that looked at primary prostate cancer cells versus metastatic cells found that “loss of MGP expression may be associated with tumor progres- sion and metastasis.”37 Note here the important roles of vitamins D and A in some of these VKDs: • The active form of vitamin D (1,25[OH]D3) stimulates the synthe- sis of osteocalcin and MGP.38 • Vitamin A (retinoic acid) stimulates the synthesis of osteocalcin but inhibits that of MGP.39 Consequently, vitamins K, D, and A work in concert and have interdependent actions. Thus for vitamin K to fully realize its poten- tial benefits, the status of vitamins D and A must be optimized so that VKDs are expressed adequately. It has also been established that the genetic effects of 1,25(OH)D3 are mediated by vitamin A through its nuclear receptor, which exerts a permissive activation on the vitamin D nuclear receptor.40 GAS-6 protein (growth arrest-specific gene 6) is believed to play a role in platelet aggregation, cell growth, and apoptosis and has been shown to support the survival of cells in tissues such as arterial muscle, eye lens epithelium, brain, and possibly others. It is also involved in supporting adequate innate immunity (natural killer [NK] cells) and reducing the risk or severity of autoimmune cellular events.41

## Modulation of Inflammation by Downregulation of

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammatory Cytokines

Vitamin K may reduce inflammation by downregulating of interleu- kin-6 (IL-6) and PGE 2 as follows: • Metabolites of vitamin K, the 5- and 7-carbon carboxylic acid catab- olites of vitamins K 1 or K 2 (MK-4 or MK-7), inhibit the release of IL-6. This was shown specifically for osteoblasts.42 • Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) has been shown to reduce the production of PGE 2 by direct inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme.43 These actions of vitamin K may reduce the activity of any inflam- matory/autoimmune diseases that are exacerbated by PGE 2 and IL-6.44 In osteoporosis, IL-6 and PGE 2 have been shown to enhance bone resorption through activation of the RANKL receptor, which in turn upregulates osteoclast differentiation.45 This mechanism is considered one of the targets of treatment with high doses of K 2 (MK-4) in reduc- ing and reversing bone loss. Vitamin K 2 has also been shown to reduce the activity of rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting the proliferation of the rheumatoid synovial cells.46 A correlation has been found between vitamin K status (plasma vitamin K 1 ) and osteoarthritic disease activity in the hands and knees.47 In the Framingham study, plasma vitamin K 1 was shown to inversely correlate with C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation. An elevated PGE 2 should also be corrected by addressing the ara- chidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (AA/EPA) ratio. This, in effect, modulates the substrates of the COX2 enzyme and would have an additional effect on PGE 2 production when added to the effect of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) of inhibiting COX2. One study states the effect of the AA/EPA ratio on another inflammatory intermediate as follows: “nuclear factor κ B is activated by arachidonic acid but not by eicos- apentaenoic acid.”48

drugs, which have a direct enzyme inhibitory action. Instead, K 2 (MK- 4) seems to work through a feedback inhibition effect on the meva- lonate pathway by “mimicking” one of its downstream metabolites, the molecule geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.49,50 This mimicry occurs by means of the side chain of vitamin K 2 (MK-4), which is the mole- cule. This may be why K 2 (MK-4) has distinct effects compared with those of other forms of vitamins K 2 or K 1 . The inhibition of the mevalonate pathway has multiple effects on human physiology besides cholesterol inhibition because it also downregulates the synthesis of various geranylgeranylated proteins (rho, rab, rac) involved in cell proliferation, cell death, and survival, inflammation, and immune response.51 Consequently when vitamin K 2 (MK-4) is supplied orally in large doses (many studies have used 45 mg and even 90 mg,52 which are in the supraphysiological range), it exerts a “mass action” characterized by some researchers as “pharma- cological” in nature. K 2 (MK-4) has been used as a drug in Japan and as a therapeutic nutrient in the United States for the prevention or reversal of osteo- porosis, prevention or reversal of cardiovascular calcification, cancer prevention, and treatment support. In conclusion, vitamin K as K 1 or K 2 has a plethora of actions and spe- cific benefits for health maintenance and disease prevention or treatment.

## Bone Health and Therapeutic Interventions for

<!-- chunk -->

## Osteoporosis

The composition of bone is relevant for determining the nutrients needed to maintain its physical structure and those required for the biochemical processes that support this structure: 70% of bone mass is represented by minerals (mostly calcium and phosphorus along with magnesium and silicon) with the rest being composed of 20% organic matter and 10% water. Organic matter is in turn composed of cells and proteins, of which collagen represents 80% to 90%.53 Collagen fibrils connect bone mineral crystals of calcium and phosphate (Fig. 126.4) and contribute to bone elasticity, strength, and overall quality, which are important determinants of fracture risk (FR).54 Bones undergo continuous remodeling by two opposing processes: (1) bone breakdown (or bone resorption) by osteoclast cells and (2) bone building by osteoblast cells. Vitamins K 1 and/or K 2 are stored in bone, partially in the same form as ingested, and partially after being converted to K 2 (MK-4). One animal study revealed a proportion of 10% K 1 and 90% K 2 (MK-4) stored in bone when only vitamin K 1 was ingested.24 Regarding MK-7, reports are conflicting, with some stating that no MK-7 is detected in bone after MK-7 supplementation23 proba- bly due to conversion to MK-4, whereas others state that some of it ends up as such in bone. It is not clear what determines the relative distribu- tion of vitamin K forms stored, but it is likely influenced by the abso- lute and relative amounts of vitamin K forms ingested and the duration of this exposure. The type and amount of vitamin K stored in bones is likely an important determinant of its clinical effects and should factor in choosing various vitamin K forms, alone or in combination, for clin- ical applications in future studies. Vitamins K 1 and K 2 modulate bone metabolism as follows: 1. Vitamins K 1 and K 2 participate as cofactors in the activation (by carboxylation) of osteocalcin, which enables binding of calcium and its proper deposition in the bone matrix. Other VKDs have been detected in bone and are believed to have functional roles, not well clarified yet. Intervention studies and large population assessments revealed that a significant percentage of osteocalcin is uncarboxylated (uncarbox- ylated osteocalcin, or ucOc) in humans of all ages. See Tables 126.4 to 126.7, which list baseline percentage ucOC in study subjects in the range of 2.6% to 65%. 2. Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) is unique among the vitamin K 2 family of compounds because the ligand it contains, geranylgeranyl (GG), is similar to one intermediate of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). GG it is believed to have inhibitory actions downstream of mevalonate and HMG-CoA, on various metabolites, including synthesis of cholesterol, inflamma- tory and proproliferatory compounds, thus reducing osteoclast proliferation.49,55,56 3. Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) stimulates synthesis of the bone blastic pro- teins osteoprotegerin and osteopontin.57 4. In vitro studies with vitamin K 2 (MK-4) have shown it to increase osteoblast production of osteocalcin and collagen type I, via steroid and xenobiotic receptor activation.58,59 This increase in collagen production may, at least partially, explain why vitamin K 2 improves bone strength and FR even when BMD is not improved, because collagen represents 80% to 90% of the organic mass of bone.60–62 Although MK-7 was also shown to activate the steroid and xenobi- otic receptor (SXR) in vitro, there is no exact overlap of its actions with those of MK-4, as a result of distinct effects on other genes.63 Because MK-7 converts to MK-4 (partially or entirely) in human physiology, it is not clear what the difference would be between the genetic effects of oral administration of these two different forms of vitamin K 2 , as no studies have investigated them side by side. 5. Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) was shown to reduce osteoblast apoptosis in in vitro studies.64 6. Vitamin K 2 , as MK-4 and MK-7, demonstrated an inhibitory effect on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in in vitro studies, whereas MK-4 exhibited a significantly greater efficiency compared with MK-7.65 7. Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) reduces osteoclast production from bone mar- row cells66 and induces osteoclast apoptosis, which in effect reduces the total number of osteoclasts. These metabolic effects are achieved

through vitamin K 2 ’s ability to downregulate inflammation (IL-6, PGE 2 ) and cell proliferation while increasing apoptosis (through the geranylated proteins produced in the mevalonate pathway).67 This is especially beneficial when osteoclastic activity is elevated, as is often the case in menopause/andropause, likely as a result of estrogen or testosterone insufficiencies. In conclusion, both K 1 and K 2 (as MK-4 or MK-7) forms can directly carboxylate osteocalcin as such. MK-4 (whether supplemented as such or derived from K 1 or MK-7) induces mechanisms that reduce bone resorption and increase collagen and osteocalcin content of bone. The MK-7 form exerts some but not all the effects of MK-4. This may be because of the unique ligand, GG, contained in MK-4, and its phar- macokinetics, which may explain its unique benefits.49,55

The combined evidence from these studies shows the following: • With respect to vitamin K 1 interventions, a dose as high as 1 mg is necessary to maximize carboxylation of Oc, which is reflected by minimizing the percentage of ucOc (% ucOc = ucOc/Total Oc) to values such as: 1.9%25 or 0.54% (close to the detection limit).68 A dose of 0.5 mg K 1 was able to lower ucOc down to 2.5% in one study,25 but others showed less lowering, such as 21.1%69 or 17.4% (males) and 24.1% (females).70 The discrepancy between studies may be a result of testing methods, and possibly other characteris- tics, such as different baseline percentage ucOC. • With respect to vitamin K 2 (MK-4), a dose of 45 mg lowered % ucOc to approximately 4.5%65 or 5%,71 whereas a 1.5 mg dose of MK-4 lowered it only to 22% or 14.3%.72 • With respect to vitamin K 2 (MK-7), doses of 0.36 mg or 0.375 mg lowered % ucOc to 10%73,74 or 9%,75 respectively. A dose of 0.18 mg MK-7 lowered % ucOc down to 24%,76 whereas a dose of 0.045 mg of K 2 (MK-7) reported a drop in % ucOc from 48% to 38%.77 The subjects in the intervention studies that used K 1 or K 2 (MK-4 or MK-7) as a supplement were also ingesting K 1 from their regular diets. These values are specified in Tables 126.4 to 126.7, based on what was reported in each study or an average intake of K 1 from the country where the study took place. Discussion of results from interventions with various forms of vitamin K are grouped as follows by vitamin K 1 , K 2 (MK-4), and K 2 (MK-7) forms because they have different pharmacokinetics and tissue deposition.

Table 126.5 lists the most relevant interventions with vitamin K 1 to date, with the majority assessing bone mineral density (BMD), one evaluating FR, and a few of them looking at markers of bone formation and breakdown. The treatment doses of vitamin K 1 used in these stud- ies range from 0.1 mg to 1.0 mg. Some authors claimed to have chosen the K 1 dose from a range of 0.1 mg to 0.5 mg, determined to be equiv- alent to what may be derived from dietary intake. However, an intake of 1 mg/day is achievable if one ingests a considerable amount of leafy greens or possibly their juices. Within a dietary range of 0.1 mg to 1.0 mg of K 1 intake, this vitamin is expected to exert its effects within nor- mal physiological function based on evolutionary adaptation78; thus we will refer to these as “physiological” doses, with higher ones con- sidered “supraphysiological.” It is not clear why K 1 doses lower than mg were chosen in any of these studies published after 2002, because at that time, a study demonstrated this to be the dose needed for complete carboxylation of osteocalcin.79 This likely maximizes the bone building effects of treatments with vitamin K 1 combined with calcium and vita- min D. In the following section is a discussion of results obtained from the studies presented in Table 126.5, which used doses of vitamin K 1 in a physiological range (0.1–1 mg) for women in menopause.

## to 1 mg on Bone Mineral Density

Only one study reported increases in whole body BMD of 1.3% and lumbar spine BMD of 1.6% in the group treated with 0.1 mg K 1 (plus 0.11 mg K 1 from the diet), which is the lowest dose used among all listed studies.80 These interventions included approximately 1000 mg of calcium (from diet + supplementation) and 400 mg magnesium (from diet), highest among all listed studies. The study setting was in Greece, where the diet was most likely of a Mediterranean type. It was the only study that imposed a certain amount of daily physical activ- ity, which was monitored by a pedometer. Bioavailability of K 1 may have been enhanced by delivery in dairy products (milk or yogurt). Only one other study, using a 0.2 mg dose of vitamin K 1 , showed an increase in BMD, and only at the ultradistal radius, of 6.2 mg/cm,81 whereas the control group showed a decline in BMD. This study also included a high calcium intake of 1000 mg, similar to the study dis- cussed previously. Other studies listed in Table 126.5 did not achieve increases in BMD despite using higher doses of vitamin K 1 (0.5–1 mg). They reported either a slower or similar BMD decline compared with the control groups. One explanation could be that all these studies incorporated insufficient calcium intake, in the range of 500 to mg. In addition, for all studies listed, the vitamin D status, as reported by serum 25(OH)D3, was typically near the lower limit of the normal reference range. This was not optimal, by US standards, but not sur- prising because the amounts of vitamin D given in supplement form were: 0, 320, 400, and 600 IUs, with no significant sun exposure.

## Metabolism

Table 126.5 lists a few studies that used supraphysiological doses of vitamin K 1 at 5 mg and 10 mg. The rationale for these doses was not explained by the authors, but it was possibly under the assumption that they would have more pronounced effects on bone metabolism, possibly by increasing conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) and their stimulatory effects on bone metabolic pathways. The resulting increase in vitamin K 2 (MK-4) stored in bone would be expected to reduce inflammation and osteoclast activity and cause osteoclast apop- tosis, possibly similar to supplementing directly with high doses of K 2 (MK-4). The study that used a dose of 5 mg in conjunction with mg calcium for postmenopausal women found a 50% reduction in FR after 2 years, whereas the BMD decline was the same as in the control group at −1.28%. Two studies used a dose of 10 mg K 1 in young ath- letes, some with amenorrhea, who had similar hormone levels to those

## Interventions With Vitamin K


# (MK-7)

Table 126.6 lists three of the only four human trials with K 2 (MK-7) interventions available, which used doses of 0.18 mg, 0.36 mg, and 0.375 mg. The fourth study used a dose of 0.1 mg K 2 (MK-7) in a side- by-side comparison with 0.1 mg K 1 , see details in Table 126.5.80 These K 2 (MK-7) doses can be considered nutritionally equivalent to a fraction of a serving of natto, which provides approximately mcg K 2 (MK-7)/serving. These doses are higher than average con- sumption of K 2 (MK-7) in Japanese and Western diets, reported at 57.4 mcg or 7 mcg MK-7, respectively. To put this in perspective, total consumption of all forms of K 2 averages 61.7 mcg and 29.1 mcg in Japanese and Western diets, respectively. All three listed studies were done in Northern Europe, where aver- age vitamin K 1 intake was reported at 0.21 mg, which counts toward the total vitamin K intervention. Vitamin D and calcium were supple- mented in only two of these studies.80,85

## Content

Studies which used supplemental doses of 0.36 mg74 and 0.375 mg85 K 2 (MK-7) reported no difference in BMD decline compared with pla- cebo, whereas the study, using the dose of 0.18 mg K 2 (MK-7), reported a slower decline in total BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) com- pared with control at the spine and femoral neck but not at total hip.76 The study that used 0.1 mg K 2 (MK-7) (plus 0.14 mg K 1 from diet) noted an increase in total BMD of 1.3%, and of 0.6% for BMD of the lumbar spine.80 This study reported the same benefit on total BMD for the vita- min K 1 intervention with 0.1 mg (plus 0.14 mg K 1 from diet) but better improvement of BMD at the lumber spine of 1.6% with the vitamin K 1 intervention. The reason why this study achieved better improvement in BMD compared to all other interventions with K 1 or K 2 (MK-7), may be a result of better bioavailability of vitamin K 2 (MK-7) and that of vita- min K 1 administered in dairy; higher calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D intake; enforcement of exercise; and a Mediterranean diet.

## Effects of MK-7 on Bone Strength, Bone Quality

The study that used the 0.18 mg K 2 (MK-7) dose for 3 years reported that one out of three bone strength indices declined less in the treat- ment compared with placebo group, whereas the other two declined to the same degree as placebo. Also, loss of height for a few lower thoracic region vertebrae was less pronounced in the 0.18 g MK-7 group.76 The study that used the 0.375 mg K 2 (MK-7) dose for 1 year reported that markers of bone quality (such as trabecular numbers, average thick- ness and spaces) were unchanged in the treatment group, while being changed unfavorably in the control group.85

## Effects of MK-7 on Markers of Bone Metabolism

A small but significant increase in the bone formation marker bone alkaline phosphatase was reported for the treatment group with 0.375 mg K 2 (MK-7), after 1 year.85 Urinary D-Pyd decreased by 21% in the group treated with 0.1 mg K 2 (MK-7) for 1 year.80

## Effects of MK-7 on Raising Bone Content of Vitamin K

One animal study compared the effects of supplementing ovariecto- mized rats with equimolar doses of K 2 (MK-7) and K 2 (MK-4) for weeks, on changes in bone content of various forms of vitamin K.86 This study showed that supplementation with an equivalent human dose of 57 mg of K 2 (MK-4) was more efficient than an equimolar human dose of 85 mg of K 2 (MK-7) at raising bone content of vitamin K, as illustrated by the following posttreatment levels: • After the K 2 (MK-4) intervention, bone levels were: 62.4 nmol/L MK-4 • After the K 2 (MK-7) intervention, bone levels were: 16.7 nmol/L MK-7+1 nmol/L MK-4

## Supraphysiological Range

Average dietary consumption of K 2 (MK-4) in Western diets was esti- mated at 7.1 mcg (2.1–28 mcg), whereas that of all forms of K 2 was 29.1 mcg (0.1–128 mcg). Knowing that a large proportion of vitamin K 1 converts to K 2 (MK-4) in human physiology, a dose as high as 1 mg MK-4 may still be considered within physiological range. Such doses were investigated only for their effect on carboxylation of Oc72 (see Table 126.4). The results show that MK-4 is not as efficient at cabox- ylating Oc as K 1 , because a dose of MK-4 of 0.9 mg was only able to lower it to 11.9% ucOc. On the other hand, all interventions designed with bone health outcomes documented so far used supraphysiological doses of K 2 (MK-4), (e.g., 45 mg). Most of these studies were done in Japan in the form of a pharmaceutical drug called Glakay, intended for menopausal or cortisone-induced osteoporosis. It is claimed that this dose was selected after lower doses of K 2 (MK-4) were studied (unpub- lished data) and did not perform as well. This dose is likely intended to enhance vitamin K 2 (MK-4) storage in bone and exert intense stimula- tion on bone biochemical pathways (Fig. 126.5). A recent study investigated a much lower dose of K 2 (MK-4) of 1.5 mg/day in menopausal women and reported no change in forearm BDM, whereas in the control group there was a 2.4% decline in BMD (see data in Table 126.7). Treatment with 45 mg MK-4 (15 mg 3x/day) has been reported in many studies to reduce FR significantly, even when BMD was not affected.32,87 Examples of such FR reduction are: 77% for hip, 60% for vertebral, and 81% for nonvertebral types.32 A meta-analysis study concludes: “high dose vitamin K 2 (MK-4) improved indices of bone strength in the femoral neck and reduced incidence of clinical fractures,” and “bone strength is a reflection of both bone mass and bone quality independent of the BMD.”87 Two meta-analysis studies concluded that the overall effect of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) on BMD was modest and only at the lumbar spine and not femoral neck.88,89 However, it is important to note that only a few of these studies used the pharmaceutical form of vitamin D 1,25 (OH) D3, which may have had some of the benefits seen when raising vita- min D status with 25(OH)D3. The data from one of these studies are presented in Table 126.7 and show that treatment of menopausal women with 1,25 (OH)D3 alone, or K 2 (MK-4) alone, could only stall the BMD decline, but the combination of these treatments was able to produce an increase in BMD of 4.92% after 2 years.90 A Glakay 1996 postmarketing population survey done in Japan of 4000 people taking the same dosage of 45 mg/day of K 2 (MK-4) did not measure BMD and showed no effect on overall FR; however, a sub- group that had at least five fractures at baseline did show a fracture reduction of about 40%.91 These disappointing results may be due to a likely suboptimal vitamin D status in the Japanese patients taking Glakay and likely lack of guidelines to supplement with calcium and vitamin D, or to increase sun exposure. It is interesting that two studies conducted in Holland and the United States, where the investigators used the same K 2 (MK-4) material from Japan (Glakay), obtained no effect on BMD (see data in Tables 126.771 and 126.592), but this may also be explained by low vitamin D status.

## 935CHAPTER 126 Vitamin K

However, the Dutch study found other positive changes in markers of bone quality, such as increased femoral neck width and BMC, even though BMD of the femoral neck and of total hip declined the same as with placebo. One of three indices of hip bone strength was maintained in the K 2 (MK-4) group but declined in the placebo group, whereas the other two indices declined less than in the placebo group. Interventions for osteoporosis are especially needed for women with insufficient estrogen resulting from menopause, ovariectomy,93 anorexia, or excess exercise. When estrogen levels drop dramatically, it promotes the following changes: (1) elevated osteoclast cell activity, (2) higher ucOc levels (probably caused by reduced carboxylation efficiency needed for Oc carboxylation), (3) increased cortisol levels,94 and (4) decreased whole body collagen synthesis, which is relevant for bone collagen.95 One Japanese study has compared the bone loss in three groups of menopausal women with that of women on placebo: group 1 took 45 mg of K 2 (MK-4) alone, group 2 took vitamin D in a drug form (active vita- min 1,25(OH)D3) alone, and group 3 took hormone replacement ther- apy (HRT) in the form of conjugated equine estrogen mix (CEE) 0.625 mg/day together with progestin (2.5 mg/day).96 After a year, the groups had the following changes in BMD: +0.23% for group 1 (with K 2 (MK- 4)), −0.47% for group 2 (with D3), +4% for group 3 (with HRT), and −2.87 for placebo. Only the result for group 3 was statistically significant in differing from placebo. The results of this study suggest that vita- min K 2 (MK-4) at 45 mg/day may at least forestall the bone loss typical of menopause. Had these investigators combined vitamin K treatment with adequate vitamin D and minerals, the results might have become significant, with a potentially larger increase in BMD. Also, it should be noted that this study used equine HRT. No studies have looked at the effects of vitamin K 2 treatment in comparison with—or ideally, in conjunction with—bioidentical HRT (BHRT), which for numerous reasons is superior, safer, and more effective than equine-based HRT. Combining vitamin K 2 and BHRT treatment is likely to produce better results, not only in terms of bone, but in effects on overall health. Similarly, one study showed that for men with low testosterone due to leuprolide treatment (for prostate cancer), a daily treatment of mg of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) was able to reduce the expected decrease in BMD.43 It is conceivable that the same treatment may be helpful for other low testosterone states as well. Corticosteroids have been shown to downregulate Oc expression, but vitamin K 2 (MK-4) supplementation at 45 mg was able to partially mitigate this effect.

## (MK-4) Compare With Bisphosphonate Actions

<!-- chunk -->

## and Does It Make Sense to Combine Them?

One Japanese study showed that combining K 2 (MK-4) supplemen- tation with bisphosphonate (BP) treatment showed an additive and synergistic effect, probably because of the complementary actions exerted by vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in addition to osteoclast apoptosis, which is the sole mechanism of typical BPs.97,98 Another study showed that vitamin K 2 (MK-4) improved the effect of the BP in reducing FR significantly (slightly more than 50%) but had only a modest effect in improving BMD. Overall, BPs seem to have a much stronger effect in increasing BMD than K 2 (MK-4). However, some BPs seem to pro- duce an increase in certain types of FR after long-term use.99 Also, as discussed in Chapter 203, Osteoporosis, although bisphosphonates increase BMD short term, such bones are less remodeled and seem to be less elastic and more brittle, and therefore, with time, tend to become more vulnerable to fracture. Another reason to add K 2 (MK-4) to BP treatment is because of the fact that BPs, like statins, inhibit for- mation of metabolites of mevalonate-derived pathways (downstream from HMG-CoA). One of these metabolites is geranylgeranyl, which is used in the conversion of all forms of vitamin K to K 2 (MK-4). Thus because some of the benefits of taking K 1 and K 2 (MK-7) are derived from their partial conversion to K 2 (MK-4), it is especially important to incorporate K 2 (MK-4) with vitamin K supplementation for patients taking BPs or statins.

## 936SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

3. Insufficient doses of the nutrients essential to the specific actions of vitamin K on bone (such as vitamin D and calcium) as well as those addressing other aspects of bone metabolism, such as magnesium, zinc, manganese, vitamin B 6 , vitamin A, and omega-3 fatty acids. 4. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble ingredient that is best delivered with fat and emulsifiers. The formulations given in different studies may have had different absorption rates as a result of delivery medium (capsule vs. soft gel, emulsifiers, mixed in dairy or delivered as an effervescent tablet to be dissolved in water, etc.).100 Also, different forms of calcium have vastly different absorption rates. 5. The common diagnostic technique to measure BMD used in stud- ies of vitamin K is not as sensitive in detecting the specific actions of vitamin K on bone as are other types of evaluations of bone health and bone quality, such as BU (bone ultrasound test of the heel), BMC, BG (bone geometry or size of various bone compo- nents, including height changes), or BS (bone strength, calculated from BMD, BG, height, and weight). By the nature of the measure- ment, BMD is thought to be unable to “give the complete picture” of bone status because it cannot distinguish architectural aspects of the bone quality, which involve its collagen scaffold.101 This in turn determines its elasticity and strength, which are all important predictors of FR. This explains why vitamin K 1 and K 2 supplemen- tation was shown to improve bone quality even in studies where BMD did not change as expected.60,71,102,103 Researchers estimate that vitamin K status, as assessed by plasma undercarboxylated Oc (ucOc), may correlate better with BU and FR than BMD.104 Bone heel BU was found to have an accuracy and ability to discriminate osteoporotic patients similar to lumbar spine BMD (by dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry, or DEXA), with potentially bet- ter prediction for FR. Consequently, it may be useful to do a BU mea- surement (in addition to or instead of DEXA) in assessing the effects of vitamin K interventions in clinical practice. One study found that “ultrasound parameters were still significant independent predictors of vertebral fracture even after adjusting for BMD.”105 The BU test may give additional information to the BMD test, especially for patients who, for example, have increased their BMD after many years of bis- phosphonate therapy (which reduces bone remodeling severely owing to its main mechanism of action of inducing osteoclast apoptosis).

## Potential Synergistic Action Between Vitamin K

## Supplemented Hydrolyzed Collagen Protein

As mentioned previously, vitamin K 2 (MK-4) was demonstrated to stimulate the synthesis of bone collagen, which represents the scaf- fold that holds the mineral crystals in an elastic, resilient architecture. Dietary collagen protein has a very similar amino acid composition to human collagens, which represent 25% to 30% of total body protein, and 16% to 18% of bone mass. On the other hand, dietary collagen protein is unique, with a very distinct amino acid composition com- pared with all other food proteins, as a result of the very high propor- tion of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. A few recent human studies have shown that supplementing with g or 10 g of hydrolyzed collagen in postmenopausal women for 1 year has resulted in increases in BMD of 6.4% in the femoral neck and 5.5% in the spine106 or 79% reduction of FR.107 In vitro studies have demon- strated that collagen peptides stimulate bone collagen synthesis while also providing collagen amino acids inside cells,108 thus we hypothe- size on a potential synergy between vitamin K 2 (MK-4) and hydrolyzed collagen supplementation.

## The Synergy and Necessity of Combining Vitamins K and D

Vitamin D is known to enhance Oc expression, which many be syner- gistic with the same action by vitamin K 2 . Vitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gut, whereas vitamin K was shown to enhance cal- cium reabsorption in the kidneys. In vitro studies show that the most active form of vitamin D (1,25[OH]D3) enhances the effect of vitamin K 2 on Oc.109 Thus vitamin D in conjunction with adequate calcium intake has potential to magnify the effects of vitamin K on calcium metabolism.110 As discussed earlier, none of the studies employing vitamin K 1 or K 2 supplementation optimized the vitamin D status (as assessed by plasma 25[OH]D3) with sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation, compared with midrange values within laboratory reference ranges in the United States. Unfortunately, the doses nec- essary to achieve this, such as 2000 to 5000 IU of vitamin D 3 per day (depending on sun exposure), are still considered above the com- monly accepted UL (upper tolerable limit). Plasma levels of 25(OH) D3 in vitamin K studies discussed here were close to the bottom of the reference range as a result of use of doses of vitamin D in the range of 200 to 1500 IU. Interestingly, the studies that administered 45 mg K 2 (MK-4) in conjunction with the active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH) D3) reported some of the best benefits on BMD among similar inter- ventions with vitamin K.

## Supplementation Efficacy

Adequate vitamin K intake from food and/or supplements or thera- peutic high-dose supplementation may achieve the best results if it is coordinated with: • Optimal vitamin D and vitamin A status.111 Hypervitaminosis A has been shown to cause an excessive increase in bone turnover and to reduce bone quality.112 • Adequate intake of well absorbed minerals (Ca, Mg, Zn, boron), vitamin B 6 , and vitamin C113 and consider supplementation with to 10 g of optimally hydrolyzed collagen protein. • Optimal omega-3/omega-6 and EPA/AA (arachidonic acid) bal- ance (to prevent excessive PGE 2 formation)114 • Proper acid/alkaline balance (possibly by monitoring urine pH) through dietary balance, optimal minerals, and potassium intake115 • Optimal levels of hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, growth hormone, cortisol, thyroid)116 as appropriate based on age and risk/benefit assessment.

## Conclusions: What Is the Best Approach to Optimizing Status

<!-- chunk -->

## of Vitamin K in Support of Bone Health?

Some of the intervention studies discussed here, for each form of vita- min K, show promising results, although few proved to completely reverse all aspects of osteoporosis progression. Most studies did not report a restoration to healthy levels for BMD, BMC, or other indices of bone strength or bone quality, nor did they report normalization in markers of bone turnover. At best, many studies showed a slower decline or no decline in the previously-mentioned markers in meno- pausal women with established osteoporosis, whereas some reported significant reduction in FR for the high-dose treatment with 45 mg K 2 (MK-4) or 5 mg K 1 . However, it seems that there is great potential in a therapy that combines all known bone beneficial nutrients, in bio- available forms and adequate doses (from diet, supplements, and sun), along with optimizing vitamin K status. All forms of vitamin K seemed to show some benefit, whether at physiological or supraphysiological doses and the question arises, when is supplementation warranted in addition to diet, with what doses, which forms, and alone or in com- bination? Nutritional bone support should be tailored based on age and gender, but the available data are mostly from studies involving women in menopause. A foundational recommendation for any age or gender is to derive as much vitamin K 1 from an abundant intake of leafy greens

## 937CHAPTER 126 Vitamin K

or their juices (which are also alkalinizing) and healthy oils, such as olive oil. Human physiology is evolutionarily adapted to an intake of vitamin K 1 as high as 1 mg/day.78 This level of intake happens to also support almost complete carboxylation of Oc, as discussed earlier. However, it is not practical to believe that most individuals will achieve this goal by adjusting their diet, because average intakes have been reported at 0.12 mg in the United States and 0.21 mg in Europe. Thus supplementation with K 1 and/or K 2 may be warranted for a large proportion of these populations. The question is, which forms and doses of vitamin K should be supplemented based on bone health goals and clinical status? A practical approach takes into consideration efficacy proven in clinical trials, pharmacokinetics, and the relative cost of the forms, given that on a per milligram basis the MK-7 ingredient is 10 times more expensive than MK-4, which in turn is 10 times more expensive than K 1 . If cost is the primary concern, the actual clinical dosages prescribed should be used to determine actual relative costs.

## Recommendation for Young Individuals

Optimizing vitamin K status with vitamin K 1 from diet plus vita- min K 1 supplements may be sufficient for men and women during development and reproductive age, with the goal of achieving peak bone mass and maintaining it until significant age-related decline in hormones occurs. In this case supplementing with K 1 , at the level of 0.5 mg to 1 mg, depending on one’s diet, may support com- plete carboxylation of Oc (possibly also that of MGP, discussed in the next section). At this level, a portion of vitamin K 1 is expected to convert to K 2 (MK-4) before, as well as after it is deposited in bone and other tissues. For individuals that take statins or bisphos- phonates, it makes sense to supplement with additional K 2 (MK-4) above this amount, because these pharmaceuticals impair conver- sion of K 1 to K 2 (MK-4).

## Peri- and Established Menopause or Men With Lower Than

## Optimal Testosterone Levels

Additional vitamin K 2 may be needed to possibly compensate for poor vitamin K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) conversion and take advantage of intensive metabolic signaling that only vitamin K 2 can exert. The question is which form and doses of vitamin K 2 should be chosen to reverse bone loss or stall its decline, if peak bone mass was optimal. The best evi- dence currently available is for the high-dose K 2 (MK-4) at 45 mg/day (15 mg 3x/day) to reduce FR and increase BMD in menopausal women or men with low testosterone, especially in studies where vitamin D status was improved. This author believes current evidence does not support recommending supplementation with the MK-7 form of vita- min K 2 over the MK-4 for the following reasons. Studies with nutritional doses of MK-7 are few, and although they have shown some benefits, the majority did not prove the ability to stall or reverse a decline in BMD or all markers of bone strength in menopausal subjects. None of the studies obtained a statistically signif- icant effect on FR. The one study that reported a benefit for BMD, at a dose of 0.1 mg K 2 (MK-7), showed that the same result was obtained from an equivalent dose of K 1 . One animal study showed that supple- mentation with K 2 (MK-4) was more efficient than with K 2 (MK-7) on raising bone content of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) and total vitamin K 2 .86 Unfortunately, there are no human studies comparing the effects on bone between K 2 (MK-7) and K 2 (MK-4). In conclusion, for older individuals that need intensive bone sup- port, it makes sense to supplement with vitamin K 1 at the level of 0.5 to 1.0 mg, or as high as 5 mg K 1 , depending on one’s diet, and an additional 45 mg K 2 (MK-4) (15 mg 3x/day). It is conceivable that less MK-4 may be just as effective in a setting where at least 1 mg K 1 is pro- vided from diet plus supplements.

## Dental Bone Support

Vitamin K status may be essential for oral health because it supports the activation of Oc and osteodentin, two functional proteins involved in tooth mineralization and dental bone metabolism. In addition, sal- ivary glands have a high content of vitamin K, which suggests addi- tional roles for it in oral health.

## Cardiovascular Health

Vitamin K influences many aspects of cardiovascular physiology: blood clotting, calcification of tissues critical to cardiovascular func- tion, arterial elasticity, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Vitamin K is an important cofactor necessary for the physiologi- cal process of inhibiting inappropriate calcification of soft tissues that are not normally calcified, such as arterial/venous vessel walls, heart valves, skin (elastin/collagen fibers), cartilage (other than the nor- mal growth-related mineralization), and kidney tissues.117 Vitamin K mediates this defensive action by carboxylation of various VKDs, such as MGP and GAS-6, which enhances their ability to bind calcium and prevent deposition in tissues where it has pathological effects. MGP, which contains five GLA residues, must be completely car- boxylated and phosphorylated to maximize calcium binding. The lev- els of plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a fraction of MGP, have been found to be a marker of arterial or other types of soft tissue calcification.118,119 The types of calcification that occur in the arterial wall can be grouped based on their location, but vitamin K status and vitamin K interventions may affect each type of calcification differently. Data in Table 126.8 summarize results from relevant interventions with vari- ous forms of vitamin K for cardiovascular pathologies.

## Intimal Calcification

Intimal calcification occurs within the atherosclerotic plaque, adjacent to the intima layer of arteries, and is always associated with atheroscle- rotic disease. The question is whether optimizing vitamin K status or using high-dose vitamin K interventions may help prevent or reduce the rate of intimal plaque formation and calcification, in conjunction with established interventions that address classical cardiovascular risk factors. One animal study, with rabbits, showed that supplementation with very high doses of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) (1, 10, or 100 mg/kg body weight) suppressed progression of arterial plaque, reduced intimal thickening, pulmonary atherosclerosis, total cholesterol, and lipid peroxidation while not promoting coagulative tenden- cies.120 In vitro studies with vitamin K have revealed various mech- anisms that may mitigate processes involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture: enhanced mitochondrial function, vitamin K 2 (MK-4) reduces inflammation, as evidenced by lowering PGE 2 , and both vitamins K 1 and K 2 (MK-4) were shown to have antioxidant activity.121 Unfortunately, no human studies have been done with vitamin K to investigate the previously mentioned CVD-related outcomes.

## Medial Calcification (or Monckeberg’s Arteriosclerosis)

Medial calcification occurs within the middle layer of the arterial wall, surrounding elastin/collagen fibers, and within transformed vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as within the heart valves and vein walls. Unlike intimal calcification, this type of calcification is not neces- sarily associated with cardiovascular plaque pathology. It seems so common that one study found it present in 95% of men and women

at autopsy.122 It seems to progress slowly with aging and may be an important component of the age-associated increase in coronary artery calcification (CAC). Suboptimal vitamin K status cannot support maximal carboxyl- ation of MGP, leaving it incompletely functional, and results in the following pathological phenomena: 1. Calcium deposition around the elastin/collagen fibers inside the arterial wall, which causes them to lose elasticity. This, in turn, will lead to reduced arterial compliance and increased risk of essential hypertension. Incidentally, the same phenomenon occurs in the skin elastin/collagen fibers, which may be one reason why skin elas- ticity decreases with aging. 2. A fraction of vascular smooth muscle cells belonging to the medial arterial wall change phenotypically to bone marrow type cells, which express osteocalcin. This in turn promotes calcium retention in the arteries.123–125 3. Calcium deposition in the walls and valves of veins and heart valves leads to dysfunctional changes in these cardiovascular tissues and impaired return circulation to and from the heart. In vitro studies have shown that vitamin K 2 was shown to stimulate collagen and elastin synthesis.58,59 This implies that vitamin K defi- ciency may reduce collagen and elastin turnover and renewal, which may contribute to loss of elasticity in many tissues that rely on it for their function.

## Disease

Some epidemiological studies found correlations between intake of vitamin K 1 or K 2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related outcomes. The study performed in the United States (Nurses’ Health Study) found that the highest (300 mcg) versus lowest (87 mcg) quintile of vita- min K 1 intake had a multivariate relative risk (RR) of CVD events of 0.84, after data were adjusted for a number of dietary factors relevant to CVD.82 The PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) study found that baseline vitamin K 1 intake was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64), while individu- als who increased their intake of dietary vitamin K 1 , over the study period, had a RR = 0.52 of cardiovascular mortality, while no associ- ation was observed between changes in vitamin K 2 intake and CVD mortality.126 One study with postmenopausal women found a significant differ- ence for total vitamin K intake between subjects with CAC (243.6 mcg) versus those without CAC (189.9 mcg).127 In contrast, an epidemiological study performed in Dutch sub- jects (the Rotterdam study) found no correlation between CVD mor- tality or CAC with vitamin K 1 intake. Instead, this study reported a RR of CVD mortality of 0.73 for the upper tertile of dietary vitamin K 2 intake (average of 40.9 mcg) compared with the lower tertile (average 15.1 mcg).73 Dietary vitamin K 2 composition was repre- sented in majority by MK-9 (14.7 mcg) and MK-8 (6 mcg), both derived mostly from cheese, and MK-4 (7.1 mcg), derived mostly from meats and eggs. MK-7 content was only 0.4 mcg. However, it is unlikely that an intake of 40.9 mcg K 2 explains the risk reduction of CVD mortality and arterial calcification, because much higher levels of vitamin K (360–500 mcg) are necessary to achieve signif- icant carboxylation of MGP (see data in Table 126.8). No study to date has shown that supplementation with small doses of vitamin K 2 can produce such benefits. For example, a study that supple- mented subjects with 100 mcg K 2 (MK-7) for 6 months did not report any improvements in CVD-related outcomes. In addition, the effects of vitamin K 2 intake cannot be interpreted in isolation from concurrent vitamin K 1 intake because their effects are additive for carboxylation of MGP and other VKDs. In the Rotterdam study, the upper tertile of vitamin K 1 intake was 311 mcg. It would have been useful if the authors had investigated the correlations involv- ing total vitamin K intake (K 1 +K 2 ). The conflicting reports on correlations with vitamin K 1 and/or K 2 may be caused by associated patterns of food intake that have CVD benefits.70,128 For example, vitamin K 1 is associated with intake of leafy greens and vegetable oils, and long-chain menaquinones are primarily provided by fermented foods (dairy or vegetarian origin), which may also be a source of probiotics. Thus the relationship between vitamin K and CVD pathologies is not likely to be revealed in correlation stud- ies because average intakes of K 1 are in the range of 100 to 200 mcg and for K 2 around 29 mcg in Western countries, which are too low to support adequate carboxylation of MGP (as depicted in Table 126.8) or have other therapeutic effects specific to vitamin K 2 . Intervention studies have used much higher doses of vitamin K 1 or K 2 to test CVD outcomes, as discussed later.

## Vitamin K Interactions With Vitamins/Hormones Affecting

<!-- chunk -->

## Matrix Gla Protein Expression and Carboxylation

A 68% reduction in MGP expression was associated with a 33% increase in arterial calcium content.129 Vitamin A and thyroid supplements are both modulators of MGP expression. Excess vita- min A has been shown to increase the risk of arterial calcification, which may be related to the fact that it downregulates MGP expression. Similarly, the thyroid hormone T3 is essential in sup- porting adequate expression of MGP, and it has been shown that MGP expression is reduced in hypothyroidism. Estrogen defi- ciency reduces carboxylation efficiency of VKD proteins. Vitamin B 6 and manganese are cofactors for the carboxylation reaction, whereas excess vitamin E (specifically alpha-tocopherol) has been shown to interfere with vitamin K recycling (similar to warfarin), thus reducing its ability to carboxylate VKDs.130 Other interac- tions between vitamin E and K are discussed under “Vitamin K Interactions.” In the setting of vitamin K deficiency, adequate intake of vita- min D and calcium promotes calcification of soft tissues and, as a result, an increase in arterial stiffness. Fortunately, one human study showed that the addition of 1 mg K 1 to the supplementation of calcium and vitamin D (plus zinc and magnesium) completely prevented an arterial stiffness increase, as observed in the control group that was supplemented only with calcium and vitamin D (plus zinc and magnesium), see detailed data in Table 126.8.131 [JP. Yet another example of the problem with researching nutri- ents using an isolation study like a drug, rather than as part of a complex matrix requiring multiple nutritional factors to function properly.]

## Calcification With Vitamin K Supplementation?

Table 126.8 presents results from intervention studies aimed at either evaluating effects on CAC or arterial stiffness. The CAC scores repre- sent the sum of intimal and medial calcium content. An animal study showed that upon vitamin K 1 supplementation, the conversion to K 2 (MK-4) resulted in an arterial tissue deposition pattern of 75% K 2 (MK-4) with the rest of 25% as vitamin K 1 , suggest- ing extensive systemic and local conversion of K 1 to K 2 . Thus K 2 (MK- 4) seems to be the preferred form in this tissue. Vitamin K 2 (MK-4) is unique among the vitamin K 2 family of compounds because the ligand it contains, geranylgeranyl (GG), is similar to one intermediate of the cholesterol synthesis pathway (downstream of mevalonate and HMG-CoA). There, GG is believed to have inhibitory actions on various metabolites, including choles- terol, inflammatory compounds and, as mentioned earlier, on osteo- clast proliferation.49,55,56 The conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) seems crucial for vita- min K to exert its role in preventing arterial calcification. This was demonstrated by one study that gave warfarin plus either K 1 (WK 1 ) or K 2 (WK 2 ) to rats, knowing that warfarin blocks K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) conversion.55 The doses of vitamin K 1 and K 2 were 1.5 mg/g diet, devised to be high enough to compensate for the arterial calcification effect of warfarin at 3 mg/g diet. Vitamin K 2 prevented calcification in the WK 2 group, whereas an equal dose of K 1 did not. This study was not designed to explore the possible benefits of giving vitamin K along with warfarin because the dose used canceled any anticoag- ulant effects from warfarin, but it proved the point that vitamin K 1 must be converted to vitamin K 2 to prevent arterial calcification.132 This is why it is important to keep in mind that statins impair the conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) by reducing the availabil- ity of GG ligand necessary to form K 2 (MK-4) from the vitamin K 3 intermediate (generated from K 1 ). The conversion of other men- aquinones, such as K 2 (MK-7) to K 2 (MK-4), may be impaired as well, because they too convert to the vitamin K 3 intermediate.133 In addition, some studies claim that a fraction of K 2 (MK-4) converts to K 3 during gut absorption and then is converted back to K 2 (MK-4) inside various tissues.24,134–138

## 940SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

For this reason, the percentage of subjects using statins has been noted in Table 126.8, to emphasize the potential influence of impaired conversions of various vitamin K forms to K 2 (MK-4) on the reported results. Statins have shown some potential in retarding intimal and/ or medial calcification, possibly by reducing inflammation and low-density lipoprotein load, but no studies have shown potential to reverse established calcifications. Two human studies showed that supplementation with 0.5 mg or 2 mg of vitamin K 1 (for 3 or 2 years, respectively) could slow the CAC progression by 6%139 or 45%,140 respectively. The corresponding reductions of dp-ucMGP were −80% and −45%, respectively. It is not clear why the authors chose the 0.5 mg dose of K 1 because doses higher or equal to 1 mg were demonstrated to support almost complete car- boxylation of Oc, which were shown to correlate with the degree of MGP carboxylation.79 The potential to reverse already established CAC of the medial layer has been demonstrated in a rat study from 2007 and such reversal has yet to be reproduced in humans.141 In the first part of the study, rats were in a protocol designed to cause them to develop arterial calcifica- tion by treatment with warfarin, which causes a state of severe vitamin K deficiency. In the second part of the study, the hypothesis tested was whether a low-dose or high-dose vitamin K 1 or K 2 (MK-4) (0.1 mg or 2 mg/day) could reverse this calcification. Warfarin was discontinued when the desired calcification level had been achieved. Vitamin K 1 or K 2 (MK-4) supplementation was given right after warfarin treatment was stopped. Both treatments of 6 weeks with 2 mg/day of vitamin K 1 and 2 mg/day or vitamin K 2 (MK-4) were able to reduce the baseline calcification by 37%. The lower dose of 0.1 mg/day of either K 1 or K 2 did not achieve the same; in fact, arterial calcification progressed in this group in spite of the fact that warfa- rin had been discontinued. The calcification reversal observed in this study is impressive, and the dose of 2 mg/day may be translated into an equivalent human dose as follows: 8 mg/kg body weight(rat)*0.16 = 1.28 mg/kg body weight (human) or 64 mg for a 50 kg person. This dose obviously falls in a supraphysiological range. Unfortunately, the animal study previously discussed did not test any intermediate doses between 2 mg and 0.1 mg/day for the same outcome. One human study has investigated effects of supraphysiological doses of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) at 45 mg on CAC and arterial stiffness for year.142 No effect was observed on CAC progression, but arterial stiffness declined by 16% in a subgroup that was vitamin K deficient at baseline, as assessed by PIVKA-2.142 Unfortunately, this study did not report the change in levels of dp-ucMGP, and no other studies did so either. Supplementation with vitamin K 2 (MK-7) was investigated for effects on arterial stiffness143,144 and other markers of CVD health.144 Supplementation with 0.1 mg K 2 (MK-7), given for 6 months, pro- duced no significant CVD-related improvements,144 and the reduction obtained in levels of dp-ucMGP was only −16%, which may explain the lack of benefits observed. Supplementation with 0.18 mg vitamin K 2 (MK-7) for 3 years resulted in a 6% reduction of arterial stiffness in a subgroup that had elevated arterial stiffness at baseline, and obtained a 50% reduction in levels of dp-ucMGP.143 Results from other studies are listed in Table 126.8, where reductions of 46%143 and 56%145 were obtained for the highest dose tested of 0.36 mg vitamin K 2 (MK-7). In conclusion, the best reduction in dp-ucMGP levels was obtained at −80% by the intervention with 0.5 mg vitamin K 1 , to a level of pmol/L.145 It is important to note that although the studies done with 45 mg vitamin K 2 (MK-4) and 0.18 mg vitamin K 2 (MK-7) showed a reduction in arterial stiffness, they did not supplement with calcium and vitamin D, which have been proven necessary for bone health. Thus these results cannot be compared with those obtained with 1 mg vitamin K 1 , which showed a prevention of arterial stiffness increase in those supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. Supplementing humans with 0.36 mg/day of K 2 (MK-7) did not slow down CAC progression (see Table 126.8).190 The benefits of all three forms of vitamin K on arterial elasticity may be caused in part by the reduction of arterial calcium deposition, and also by the demonstrated ability of vitamin K 2 to stimulate colla- gen and elastin synthesis.58,59 This is especially needed in menopause when collagen and elastin synthesis is reduced as a result of estrogen deficiency.95

## What May Be the Most Efficacious Intervention With Vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

## K Supplements to Prevent or Benefit Cardiovascular Disease?

A preventive approach to CVD is to maintain an optimal vitamin K status throughout life, which would likely prevent/retard age-related increases in arterial medial calcification and stiffness. In fact, the term age-related calcification may be replaced with vitamin K deficiency- related calcification and treated as a reversible condition. The question is what would be the most effective doses and forms of vitamin K for therapeutic interventions for those with established CVD and CAC? Current commercially available forms of vitamin K are: K 1 , K 2 (MK-4), K 2 (MK-7) and/or a mix of long-chain menaqui- nones (MK-6,-7,-9), but K 2 (MK-4) and long menaquinones are times and 100 times more expensive than K 1 per microgram, whereas there are no side by side comparisons on relative efficacy for CVD. As discussed in the previous section, human interventions with vitamin K 1 seem to provide good evidence for reducing CAC progres- sion and maintaining arterial elasticity. In spite of promising results from animal studies that showed that supraphysiological doses of K 1 and K 2 (MK-4) can reverse vitamin K deficiency-induced CAC, one human study with K 2 (MK-4) reported no changes in CAC progres- sion, whereas the rest did not assess it. Interventions with K 2 (MK-4) or K 2 (MK-7) reported reduced arterial stiffness by 16% and 6%, respec- tively, but it is not clear if they would completely prevent an increase in arterial stiffness when supplemented along with adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, as proven by vitamin K 1 supplementation. Because vitamin K 1 interventions did not completely stall or reverse CAC, and the role of K 2 (MK-4) is established to be critical in this process, it is possible that a combination of vitamin K 1 and K 2 may provide a synergistic and more efficacious intervention than vitamin K 1 alone, especially for older individuals. For patients who take statins, supplementation with large doses of K 2 (MK-4) is warranted, because these medications impair conversion of K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) by reducing synthesis of geranylgeraniol. As discussed in the osteoporosis section, average intake of vitamin K 1 is low in Western and Asian populations and it is not practical to believe that most individuals would change their diet enough to raise it to a physiologically replete level (close to 1 mg/day). Thus in most cases, it makes sense to suggest supplementing with 1 mg vitamin K 1 , as a foundation for optimizing vitamin K status. Human physiology has likely adapted through evolution to an intake close to 1 mg K 1 ,78 and relatively small amounts of additional MK-4 and long-chain menaqui- nones, probably around 0.05 mg (based on average intake in Holland). Supplementing with at least 1 mg K 1 is important for maintaining arte- rial elasticity, especially females, who need to ingest adequate amounts of calcium (from diet + supplements) and vitamin D. The question is which form(s) of vitamin K 2 should be added to a foundational amount of K 1 , and in what therapeutic doses, to improve the odds of stalling or reversing CAC and arterial stiffness? There are no side-by-side comparison studies available for treat- ments with K 2 (MK-4) and K 2 (MK-7) that evaluated CVD outcomes or the types and amounts of vitamin K stored in arterial tissue. The

<!-- chunk -->

## 941CHAPTER 126 Vitamin K

effects of treatments with 45 mg K 2 (MK-4) on reducing arterial stiff- ness were stronger than those with 0.18 mg K 2 (MK-7). Thus based on current data, it makes sense to choose supplementation with K 2 (MK-4) over that with K 2 (MK-7), especially because K 2 (MK-7) likely derives all its benefits from its conversion to K 2 (MK-4). Future studies should investigate the effects of combinations of a foundational amount of K 1 (e.g., 1 mg) plus various amounts and forms of vitamin K 2 on CAC- and CVD-related benefits.

## Anticoagulant Treatments Such as Warfarin?

Anticoagulant therapy induces an extreme state of vitamin K defi- ciency, and studies have shown that it may increase arterial calcifica- tion by twofold to eightfold as well as increasing aortic pulse pressure and heart valve calcification.141 Patients on anticoagulant treatment are told to minimize intake of vitamin K-containing foods, such as green leafy vegetables. Most patients end up not eating enough vegetables in fear of counteracting their anticoagulant therapy. This is unfortunate, because they would be obviously missing important benefits. Some studies have proposed and demonstrated that supplementing with vitamin K 1 doses in the range of 0.1 to 5 mg, during anticoagulant therapy, may help mini- mize the need for adjusting the dose of the anticoagulant in response to dietary variations of vitamin K.146,147 One shortcoming of using vitamin K 1 in this scenario is that warfarin blocks the conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 , which eliminates many of its benefits, especially in the extrahepatic tissues. This strategy could potentially be implemented with vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in addition to vitamin K 1 , although no studies have explored this yet. The advantages of using additional vitamin K 2 would be as fol- lows: (1) it would bypass the warfarin block on vitamin K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) conversion and (2) a fraction of the ingested vitamin K 2 (MK-4) is absorbed intact and can reach arteries (and other peripheral tissue such as bone), where it may partially compensate for the undesirable effects of the anticoagulant, such as tissue calcifications (in arteries, veins, and heart valves).

Epidemiological, interventional, and in vitro studies provide evidence that vitamin K plays a role in reducing the incidence and progression of cancer. The three different forms of vitamin K each seem to mani- fest distinct activities in vitro against cancer cells. Vitamin K 3 has been found to have the highest anticancer activity through multiple mech- anisms, followed by vitamin K 2 , whereas vitamin K 1 had the weakest effect. Vitamin K 3 was shown in vitro and in vivo to induce oxidative stress, generate hydrogen peroxide, and deplete glutathione, unlike vitamins K 1 and K 2 . In fact, some studies showed an antioxidant activ- ity for the latter.148 Most likely the human body derives a significant amount of vita- min K 3 from cleaving the side chains of vitamin K 1 or K 2 , especially when these agents are ingested in supraphysiological doses. One study found that urinary excretion of vitamin K 3 was significant 2 to 3 hours after vitamin K 1 ingestion, but plasma vitamin K 3 was not measured.20 It was also estimated that the percentages of vitamin K 1 or K 2 (MK-4) or K 2 (MK-7) to K 3 conversion are around 5% to 25%. This is believed to occur in the intestinal cells and other extrahepatic tissues, possi- bly also in the liver. Any effect of oral vitamin K 1 on cancer could be attributed to its direct actions and its partial conversion to K 3 and K 2 . Similarly, any effect on cancer from oral vitamin K 2 could be attributed to its direct actions and its partial conversion to K 3 . Vitamin K 3 is cytotoxic to cancer cells through oxidative effects and various other mechanisms of action. In vitro studies with vitamin K 3 have shown an inhibitory effect against breast, endometrial, urological, and prostate cancer as well as leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma.2 Unfortunately, K 3 is also toxic to normal cells, especially red blood cells, which is why it is no longer used as a provitamin in humans. This profile would most likely qualify vitamin K 3 as a chemotherapeutic agent, but because it is not a patentable molecule, there are not enough studies to achieve U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evalu- ation. Currently, vitamin K 3 is only allowed to be used for research purposes in humans; in animals, it is used as a vitamin K precursor to vitamin K 2 . Many studies have observed a synergistic benefit from combin- ing vitamin K 3 with vitamin C (in the intravenous and oral forms) for reducing the rise of prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer patients149 and also with all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) for the treat- ment of leukemia.2 Vitamin K 3 has also been shown to inhibit DNA polymerase and angiogenesis150 and to act as a radiation sensitizer. Oral and intravenous vitamin K 3 has been used in studies for the treatment of various cancers (leukemia, lung, prostate, and blad- der) with and without chemotherapy; such treatment has resulted in improved survival and reduced cancer growth but not complete cures.2 One epidemiological study of a Dutch population found a reduced risk of overall cancer incidence and mortality by 14% and 28%, respec- tively, for the upper quintiles of vitamin K 2 intake, whereas no cor- relation was found with the intake of vitamin K 1 .151 The risk reduction was most pronounced for lung and prostate cancer. These results are strikingly similar to the correlations found for vitamin K 2 intake and reduced risk of cardiovascular calcification in the Dutch epidemiolog- ical studies. Considering that the average intake of vitamin K 2 in the population studied is in the range of 26 mcg (first quintile) to 42 mcg (fourth quintile), the results are surprising and warrant future inter- ventional studies with doses of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in that range and above.

## and Cancer

Very few studies have investigated the effects of oral supplementation with vitamin K 1 on cancer but those that have been done include the following: 1. Oral supplementation with 5 mg of vitamin K 1 for 4 years, along with 800 IU of vitamin D 3 and 1500 mg of calcium, resulting in an approximate 75% reduction in all types of cancer in postmeno- pausal women. This was a randomized controlled trial designed to observe the effect of vitamin K 1 plus vitamin D and calcium on bone density; the cancer findings were incidental.104 2. A number of Phase I/Phase II trials investigated the effect of oral supplementation with 40 mg (20 mg twice daily) of vitamin K 1 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. All studies found improved survival rates, temporary disease stabilization, and reduced tumor growth and invasion.2 3. A recent study used both an oral dose of 40 mg/day of vitamin K 1 in one group and incremental intravenous doses of vitamin K 1 (from 40 mg to 1000 mg) in small groups of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and distant metastases. All doses, oral and intravenous, were tolerated without toxicity.

K 1 , had tumor shrinkage, and 16 of each group had tumor stabili- zation (according to computed tomography). Also, 3 and 6 patients of the oral and intravenous groups, respectively, had a reduction in the tumor marker alfa fetoprotein (AFP).152 In vitro testing of tumor cells extracted from the subjects in this study has shown that vitamin K 1 induced an inhibition of cell growth through “phos- phorylation of JNK and c-Jun and caspase-mediated apoptosis.” Even though the authors were aware of the evidence for the effi- cacy of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) in this type of cancer, they stated that they chose vitamin K 1 instead because “it is the only form of vita- min K available clinically in the US.” Also, the study authors stated that the dose of 40 mg was chosen based on “how many tablets of the drug Mephyton (5 mg K 1 ) were the patients willing to swallow comfortably.”

## and Cancer

In vitro studies have identified an anticancer activity for vitamin K 2 against liver, colon, leukemia, lung, stomach, lymphocyte, osteosar- coma, epidermoid, glioma, hepatoma, and breast cancer cell lines. Some of the anticancer mechanisms that have been identified for vita- min K 2 are induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest (at G1/S transition), cell differentiation, reduction of cell proliferation and angiogenesis (resulting from inhibition of COX2), inhibition of signaling for tumor growth, and activation of the PXR genes. Many of these actions are not shared by vitamin K 1 , which may be because of vitamin K 2 ’s specific side chain, the molecule geranylgeranyl. Interventions with oral doses of 20 to 135 mg (but most frequently with 15 mg three times daily) of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) have led to improved survival rates for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a slower progression and reduced recurrence rates (especially when patients were infected with the hepatitis C virus).153 The combination of vita- min K 2 (MK-4) treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor decreased the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Because none of the studies employing high doses of vitamin K 1 or K 2 investigated any lower doses of vitamin K, such as 1 mg or any dose in between 1 and 40 mg of vitamin K 1 or 1 and 45 mg of vitamin K 2 (MK-4), the minimum dose that would achieve the same effect is not clear, nor, most importantly, is it known at what point no further benefit can be achieved by increasing the dose. Some promising responses have been obtained from using high doses of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) (45 mg) for patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, with an improvement of anemia and thrombocytopenia and sometimes complete remission.154 The effect was even more pronounced for the group who were also given vitamin D 3 . Vitamin K status, measured by the percent uncarboxylated osteo- calcin in serum, was found to correlate with advanced-stage and high- grade prostate cancer.155 As discussed later, this biomarker of vitamin K status can be considered a marker not only for bone health but also for risk prediction for other conditions where vitamin K plays an important role. In using vitamin K supplementation for general health and for can- cer therapy, it is important to keep in mind that, in advanced stages of certain cancers, thrombosis is abnormally activated. This is medi- ated through unclear mechanisms that may be unique to each cancer’s strategy to promote its survival and metastasis. Upregulation of clot- ting factors and other VKDs, as mentioned, may have an important role in this pathological process. McCann et al. point out that in some specific cancer cases, warfarin treatment has been shown to improve survival rates.30 In utilizing vitamin K for cancer risk reduction or treatment, the patient should be evaluated first for coagulation/thrombosis status to make sure that he or she is not in a state where the cancer process is upregulating that status. In addition, for therapeutic effects, the vitamin K 2 (MK-4) form may be a better choice than vitamin K 1 in implementing a therapy with supraphysiological doses. The dose in the vicinity of 45 mg has a good safety record and the most evidence for efficacy. High doses of vita- min K 2 (MK-4) were found not to increase clotting or platelet aggrega- tion while actually reducing thrombotic tendencies. On the contrary, vitamin K 1 was shown to increase thrombotic tendencies at very high doses. This and the fact that the overall efficacy of vitamin K 1 against cancer is weaker compared with K 2 (MK-4) make vitamin K 2 (MK-4) the overall better candidate for therapeutic doses in cancer treatment and prevention in high-risk patients.

## Therapy

The optimization of vitamin K status with diet and/or supplements, as well as therapeutic doses of these two vitamers, may have many addi- tional benefits to those previously discussed. These additional effects can be inferred from the presence of VKDs in many tissues, even though all their roles have not been precisely identified. In addition, observing vitamin K deficiency states or inducing them in laboratory experiments for various tissues has provided many clues on vitamin K’s potential to alleviate various pathological processes. Vitamin K has a complex role in the clotting processes support- ing both the coagulation and anticoagulation/balancing pathways. Its deficiency may lead to increased risk of hemorrhage in various condi- tions: excessive menstrual, gum, or nose bleeding and increased risk of hemorrhage in infants born and breastfed by vitamin K-deficient mothers.156,157 Vitamin K deficiency may have many other consequences: 1. Improper cartilage maturation as a result of excessive growth plate mineralization158 2. Accelerated age-related degeneration of the intervertebral discs (increased calcified/uncalcified cartilage ratio)159 3. Reduced glucosamine and glycosaminoglycan synthesis, which affects the health of many tissues in the body: joint cartilage, ten- dons, ligaments, the dermal layer of the skin, the lining of the gastro- intestinal tract, as well as the walls of the and blood vessel and veins36 4. Suboptimal skin health, elasticity, and overall appearance caused by the following consequences of vitamin K deficiency: • Increased skin collagen breakdown • Risk of calcification of the elastin fibers, which are a major determinant of skin elasticity • Thinning of the skin ground substance layer. MGPs are found in the dermis, and control collagen expression as well as glycos- aminoglycan biosynthesis (collagen and glycosaminoglycans are both components of the supporting structure of the dermis). 5. Impaired insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance160 6. Increased risk of kidney stone formation161 7. In animal studies (rats), vitamin K deficiency was shown to cause suboptimal energy production, a 10% reduction in muscle cre- atine kinase, and a 20% reduction in the alkaline phosphatase of the intestinal mucosa, which may be caused by structural mito- chondrial alterations162 8. Inadequate antioxidant protection of the brain 9. Increased severity of cystic fibrosis. Supplementation with 1 mg of vitamin K 1 was shown to be useful in compensating for the car- boxylation defects that are characteristic of cystic fibrosis163 10. Reduced testosterone production164

## Vitamin E May Interfere With Vitamin K Metabolism When

<!-- chunk -->

## Administered in Very High Doses

Supplementation with high doses of vitamin E, such as 800 to IU of alpha-tocopherol, has been shown to impair blood clotting by interfering with the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of prothrom- bin.130 This is thought to be mediated by a metabolite of oxidized vita- min E called tocopheryl quinone. Another study in rats suggested that high doses of vitamin E may impair the conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 .166 This is thought to be a result of the competition that can occur between vitamin K 1 and excess vitamin E for a specific cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for the first step in the conversion of vitamin K 1 to K 2 . Reviews also point out that excessive doses of vitamin E may upreg- ulate the expression of metabolizing enzymes responsible for both vitamin E and vitamin K clearance.166 The reverse may be also true when supraphysiological doses of vitamin K are administered, espe- cially when the individual’s vitamin E status is marginal. Trauber167 estimates that 90% of the population does not even meet the recom- mended daily intake (RDI) of 15 IU/day. High doses of either vita- min E or vitamin K can activate the xenobiotic pathways (via the PXR nuclear receptor) twofold to tenfold. Fig. 126.6 shows the interaction between vitamins A, E, and K in activating the PXR nuclear receptor. Landes et al. comment on this phenomenon as follows: “the organism handles such supranutritive dosages of vitamins like potential harm- ful xenobiotics.”168 One should keep in mind that the PXR-activated metabolic pathways are also involved in the clearance of many phar- maceutical drugs. Because vitamin K seems to play an important role in reducing car- diovascular calcification, the interference by excess vitamin E (of various forms) on vitamin K metabolism may be one of the reasons why a few meta-analytic studies have found increased risk of cardiovascular events in populations that supplemented with alpha-tocopherol in excess of IU. The effects of excess vitamin E may be most relevant when vitamin K status is marginal, which is very common. To put things in evolutionary perspective, an analysis by Cordain of the nutritional content of a typical Paleolithic diet found that the average intake of alpha-tocopherol was around 19 IU for a 2200-Kcal diet.78 However, the average total content of the other forms of vitamin E in that diet (such as beta-, gamma-, or delta-tocopherol) has not been estimated, but it is known that they have many metabolic roles that are distinct from those of alpha-tocopherol. At an intake of alpha-tocopherol above 100 IU, certain metabolic path- ways may be pushed beyond the range of “normal physiology.”

## Interactions With Pharmaceutical Drugs

## Anticoagulants Based on Vitamin K Antagonism

Anticoagulants, such as warfarin or coumarin, interfere with vitamin K activation and recycling. Specifically, they inhibit the enzymes epoxide reductase and quinone reductase. It has been estimated that the body reuses the same vitamin K molecule in the range of 100 times before it metabolizes it for excretion through bile or urine. When an anticoagu- lant is present, vitamin K recycling is greatly reduced. Anticoagulants also interfere with vitamin K activity in extrahepatic tissues, and studies have shown them to increase the risk of osteoporosis and fracture and to delay fracture healing; they may also contribute to arterial or heart valve calcifi- cation and hypertension.169,170 If the total amount of vitamin K from food and supplements is increased by 100 mcg/day, it will most likely require an adjustment in anticoagulant dose. Consequently, vitamin K intake from food and supplements must be closely monitored with this therapy. See the previous discussion about the potential benefits of supplementing with a small dose of vitamin K 2 along with the anticoagulant therapy.

## Metabolism

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and salicylates exert most of their blood-thinning effect by reducing platelet aggregation via the inhibi- tion of COX enzymes and potentially other mechanisms. In addition, these compounds have a mild anticoagulant action by inhibiting vita- min K recycling (similar to that of warfarin but a lot milder).172 Aspirin has been shown to increase bone loss and impair fracture healing, and although the mechanisms have not been elucidated, this could cer- tainly be caused in part by its mild anti ‒ vitamin K effect.

## Antibiotics Interfere With Vitamin K Metabolism

Antibiotics may increase the need for vitamin K supplementation because (1) they may kill gut bacteria that normally produce vita- min K 2 in the intestinal tract, (2) they may interfere with vitamin K activation and recycling (similar but milder than anticoagulants like warfarin), and (3) they may inhibit the activation of various proteins (carboxylation) by vitamin K.173 Examples include broad-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefamandol, moxalactam, and cefoperazone.

reductase by as much as 20%, which is similar to warfarin’s mech- anism of action. This may be relevant to the metabolism of vitamin K in the skin when BHT is applied topically, and could, for example, increase the risk of calcification of the elastin fibers, thus decreasing skin elasticity.

# VITAMIN K STATUS BIOMARKERS

A big portion of the ingested vitamin K 1 is metabolized and excreted (through bile and urine) within 12 to 24 hours. However as aver- age intake of vitamin K 1 increases, so does fasting plasma level of K 1 .81,82,129 Plasma vitamin K 1 may be useful in monitoring patients on anticoagulants in conjunction with the typical coagulation-re- lated tests such as the international normalized ratio (INR) and pro- thrombin time. A complete assessment of vitamin K status should reflect the degree of vitamin K sufficiency for all physiological functions in the body that require vitamin K 1 and/or K 2 for their optimal activity. Unfortunately, such a complete assessment is not available at this time, partly because there are so many VKDs in the body that are carboxylated by vita- min K, and researchers predict that new ones may still be uncovered in future research. Also, many of vitamin K’s functions and physiological effects are unrelated to its carboxylation effect. Unlike other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamins K 1 and K 2 have not been found to be stored in excess anywhere in the body. Even after long-term dosing, such as a few years, supplementation with supra- physiological doses of vitamin K 1 or K 2 (10 or 45 mg, respectively), apparently no toxic storage levels or effects have been observed. Every molecule of vitamin K is reused multiple times through a recycling mechanism before it is excreted, and perhaps that is why there is no need to store large amounts of it in the tissues. Prolonged intake of a significant dose of vitamin K has been shown to have a cumulative effect in improving functional markers of vitamin K status. For example, it has been shown to cause a progressive increase over many months of the percentage of carboxylated osteocalcin (Oc) and increased levels of total Oc (the sum of carboxylated plus uncar- boxylated Oc).

## Currently Available Tests for Vitamin K Status

Vitamin K deficiency results in the appearance of undercarboxyl- ated VKDs (ucVKDs) in the plasma and various tissues and organs throughout the body. It is also conceivable, although not yet com- pletely demonstrated, that if the vitamin K intake reaches a high enough level, all VKDs in the body would be close to 100% carboxyl- ated; consequently, all levels of ucVKDs would be close to zero. Typical biochemical markers of vitamin K status used in studies are plasma levels of ucVKDs or their normalized values. However, one should keep in mind that plasma levels of any one type of ucVKD or carboxylated VKD (cVKD) do not always correlate with their total amounts found throughout the body. The following vitamin K status tests have been used in studies: plasma undercarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA II, which stands for proteins induced by vitamin K absence or vitamin K antagonism by anticoagulant drugs), plasma or urine ucOc, and plasma undercar- boxylated matrix GLA protein (dp-ucMGP). Of all the tests men- tioned, PIVKA II is available from many commercial laboratories in the United States; plasma levels of ucOc are available from only one specialty laboratory in the United States (Genova Diagnostics) and dp-ucMGP is available from Immunodiagnostics Systems Ltd. in the United Kingdom. It is important to note that as vitamin K 1 and/or K 2 intake increases, clotting-related VKDs (such as prothrombin synthesized in the liver) are carboxylated with higher priority than the extrahepatic VKDs (such as Oc and MGP). This is an example of the “triage theory” presented by McCann and Ames in their review.30 There they present evidence for the concept that evolutionary pressure may have led to prioritizing nutrient allocation in the order of importance for the “survival of the species.” In this case, clotting is obviously more important for survival than bone or arterial health, so the carboxylation of the clotting-related proteins is prioritized. For example, one study has shown that for patients on a small dose (1 mg) of warfarin, PIVKA II started decreasing when vitamin K 1 intake was around 100 mcg, whereas ucOc plasma levels did not start decreasing until vitamin K 1 intake reached around 300 mcg/ day.147 Consequently, PIVKA II may decrease significantly and approach zero for vitamin K 1 intakes in the lower range of the average intakes, whereas ucOc levels may not approach zero until vitamin K intake is much higher. One landmark study showed that the percentages of ucOc levels may approach zero when intakes of vitamin K 1 are in the range of 1000 to 2000 mcg.79 No studies have found an equiv- alent amount of vitamin K 2 that can achieve the same decrease in percentage of ucOc, which corresponds to an almost complete car- boxylation of Oc. Suggestions for possible biomarkers of vitamin K status: 1. PIVKA II is the inactive form of prothrombin, and it is a sensitive marker of vitamin K 1 status at very low intakes (for example, in the vicinity of 100 mcg of vitamin K 1 /day). It is not clear how PIVKA II levels are affected by vitamin K 2 (in various forms) compared with vitamin K 1 . One study showed that the INR was lowered similarly by a lower amount of vitamin K 2 (MK-7) compared with vitamin K 1 .175 Consequently, patients taking supple- ments and foods containing various forms of vitamin K (such as vita- min K 1 , MK-4, MK-7) should be very closely monitored for changes in INR. 1. Plasma ucOc level is a test currently available only from one com- mercial laboratory in the United States specializing in nutrition status-related tests (Metametrix). Some studies have also measured the normalized value of ucOc relative to total osteocalcin (called %ucOc = ucOc/total Oc, or the ratio OCR = ucOc/iOc, iOc with meaning “intact or carboxylated osteocalcin”). The plasma levels of ucOc and its normalized ratios, %ucOc and OCR, have good sensitivity for a wide range of vitamin K 1 and/or K 2 intakes. The upper threshold of sensitivity seems to be achieved for a vitamin K 1 intake in the range of 1000 to 2000 mcg. However, ucOc measurements may not be adequately sensitive for patients on antico- agulant therapy or with very low vitamin K intakes (which represents an alarming 60%–70% of the population). The measurement of both PIVKA II and ucOc may give a good approximation of vitamin K status with good sensitivity over a wide range of vitamin K intakes even though they reflect only a few facets of the vitamin K status. It should be noted that even if a patient has a considerably high intake of vitamin K 1 (around 1000–2000 mcg/day) and a correspond- ing low ucOc level, this does not rule out a deficiency of vitamin K 2 if one were to consider vitamin K 2 a conditionally essential nutrient. This is especially important for certain patients who are older and have genetic polymorphisms or certain severe conditions such as advanced osteoporosis and/or arterial calcification, cancer, multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis.

## 945CHAPTER 126 Vitamin K

Oc has an established role in bone metabolism and studies have revealed significant direct correlations between ucOc or %ucOc and fracture risk and bone density.176 However, the ucOc marker may be useful for the management of diseases besides the ones related to bone because it conceivably cor- relates with the percentage of carboxylation of other extrahepatic VKDs in the body. For example, one study found a positive correlation between plasma levels of %uOc and the risk of prostate cancer.151 It is important to note that average populations deemed “appar- ently healthy” were found to have an average of 15% to 50% ucOc. Specifically, one study found teenage girls to have an average %ucOc of 21.9%.177 This is considered by many researchers a sign of subclin- ical vitamin K deficiency, which may have various detrimental con- sequences for bone development, cartilage, brain, and the nervous system, because vitamin K is so critically involved in the physiology of all these tissue and organs. This is just one example why the RDI for vitamin K is outdated. 1. ucMGP is currently assessed only in the United Kingdom but hope- fully may be offered in the future by US commercial laboratories because it has good potential in evaluating and devising nutritional interventions for patients at risk of or with existing arterial calcifi- cation. Plasma levels of ucMGP were found to directly correlate with arte- rial calcium buildup and calcium scores but only for patients with relatively low amounts of arterial calcium and in early stages of cardio- vascular disease.124 Thus the plasma level of ucMGP is thought to be a good indicator of current mild buildup of calcium in the arterial wall and/or of future risk of arterial calcification. If this test becomes commercially available in the future, it may be helpful in guiding clinicians to devise the appropriate vitamin K intake for each patient so as to maximally reduce the risk of further cardiovas- cular calcification and possibly even reverse it. Because the ucMGP measurement is not yet offered in the United States, the best available surrogate marker for it is plasma ucOc and its normalized ratio, which may also predict to a certain extent current or future risk of arterial calcification. However, it is also important to keep in mind that when the ucOc level is close to zero, it may not nec- essarily mean that the level of ucMGP in the body is also the lowest possible or that vitamin K intake has reached a level high enough to support complete carboxylation of all MGPs in the body and thus is providing significant protection from arterial calcification. Some researchers point to the fact that osteocalcin contains three GLA residues, whereas MGP contains five; therefore they hypothe- size that the carboxylation of MGP may require a higher vitamin K intake than that of Oc. This may be another example of the triage theory presented by McCann and Ames in their review, discussed previously. In summary, until more vitamin K assessments are available, plasma ucOc is the best biomarker for guiding patients toward opti- mization of their vitamin K status with vitamin K 1 and/or K 2 from diet and supplements, although it is only a partial marker of vitamin K suf- ficiency in the body. Warfarin causes, by design, an impairment in the carboxylation of various clotting proteins, but unfortunately it also affects all other extrahepatic VKDs. For example, one study found that a “minidose” of warfarin of 1 mg/day induced an increase in %ucOc from 8% to around 20%, and it will most likely increase ucMGP as well.178 By monitoring ucOc and ucMGP in addition to PIVKA II, along with standard clotting parameters (such as prothrombin time and INR) in these patients, it may be possible to find the appropriate dose of vitamin K 2 for each individual that may reduce to a certain extent the effects of warfarin on extrahepatic tissues. All this would be done while keeping the INR within the therapeutic range. In interpreting tests that measure the levels of undercarboxylated VKDs, it is important to keep in mind that there are other factors, other than vitamin K, that may affect these results, as follows: 1. Deficiencies of vitamin B 6 and manganese, as well as low sex hor- mone status (estrogen or testosterone), may reduce the carboxyl- ation rate of VKDs.3 2. Factors that can lower the production of osteocalcin or MGP include low vitamin D and K status (including treatment with war- farin), excess or deficiency of vitamin A, corticosteroid therapy, hypothyroid state (defined as suboptimal T3 levels), and possibly high endogenous production of cortisol.179 3. Total plasma levels of Oc may be elevated by vitamin D supple- mentation and in states of increased bone turnover (e.g., during adolescence, after injury, or after menopause). Because so many factors can influence the levels of osteocalcin, some researchers believe that the normalized values of ucOc (OCR and %ucOc), rather than absolute values of ucOc, may be a better indicator of vitamin K status. However, this is still under debate, and researchers who favor the absolute levels of uOc argue that ucOc may be released more easily from the bone matrix into the blood compared with carboxylated Oc because carboxylation enhances its ability to bind calcium in the bone matrix. Thus the plasma ratios of these two biomarkers may not correlate with their tissue ratios. 1. MGP expression is decreased in hypothyroidism, which will also affect the body’s ability to reduce arterial calcification. Other factors that may increase the need for vitamin K intake and affect the interpretation of the ucVKDs tests include genetic polymor- phisms, aging, fat maldigestion and/or malabsorption, pharmaceuti- cals (antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, aspirin), or excess vitamin E. One should keep in mind that oxidative stress may impair the tissues’ ability to recycle vitamin K to reuse it for carboxylation multiple times. Thus the vitamin K status should be thought of based not only on vitamin K intake but also how well it increases tissues stores and on how many times each vitamin K molecule can be recycled. It is also important to note that during active cancer development, various clotting factors may become upregulated, including thrombin.

## Current RDI Versus Expanded Criteria for Defining

<!-- chunk -->

## Optimal Vitamin K Intake

The adequate intake (AI) of vitamin K, specifically for the K 1 form, is 90 mcg for women and 120 mcg for men, or 1 mcg/kg per day.180 For vitamin K, the AI criterion was initially adequate blood clotting, because that was the only vitamin K role recognized at the time. A new AI may have to be increased significantly to support the function of various tissues and organs affected by vitamin K status. The average intake of vitamin K 1 in United States was found to be 70 mcg/day for the younger and 120 mcg/day for the older popula- tion. Whereas intakes of vitamin K in the United Kingdom are sim- ilar to those in the United States, in other European countries, such as Holland, average vitamin K 1 intakes are significantly higher, at mcg. Surveys have found severe population deficiencies of vitamin K 1 , even relative to the current AI.181 Sixty to seventy percent of the US population does not even meet the current AI (90–120 mcg) for vita- min K, which is already well below what may be necessary for optimal health. Some 5% to 15% of people have been found to have undetect- able levels of plasma vitamin K 1 .

## 946SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

The majority of vitamin K 1 consumed in the United States is derived from vegetable oils as opposed to vegetables. Owing to the high preva- lence of hydrogenated and fried oils and storage in transparent bottles (which allows vitamin K to be destroyed), it is possible that the active amount of vitamin K 1 ingested may be even lower than previously estimated. This widespread deficiency of vitamin K 1 is not surprising, because consumption of vegetables is deficient in the American diet. The well-founded recommendation of consuming five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day could provide an amount of vitamin K 1 close to 1000 mcg/day.

## Intake: Preventative

<!-- chunk -->

## Versus Therapeutic Strategies

As discussed, vitamin K 1 has multiple extrahepatic functions. The only function studied with escalating doses of vitamin K 1 was osteocalcin carboxylation. From the results of that study, we can hypothesize that an intake of 1 to 2 mg of vitamin K 1 may be the best preventive dose for supporting bone health, because it supports a virtually complete carboxylation of Oc. However, based on the intake surveys discussed earlier, it is not realistic to assume that individuals would change their diet enough to achieve this level of intake, thus supplementation with 0.9 to 1.0 mg K 1 may be needed in a large proportion of the general population. One study showed that 5 mg/day of vitamin K 1 may significantly reduce fracture risk and cancer incidence of all types, but it did not include comparison groups taking any other doses between 1 and mg.104 This dose may be safe to use because there is no UL established for K 1 , but one has to keep in mind that this is a supraphysiological dose. Based on the studies that investigated effects on CVD, vitamin K 1 doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg would likely have a beneficial effect on reducing progression of arterial calcification of the medial layer. It is not clear whether increasing this dose or adding vitamin K 2 may have the potential to completely prevent it. More studies are needed to establish the optimal intake of vitamin K 1 that can minimize the levels of nonfunctional MGP (dp-ucMGP), because carboxylated MGP is a major player in reducing calcification of various cardiovascular tissues (arteries, veins, heart valves). In addition, the 1 mg dose was shown to completely prevent an increase in arterial stiffness caused by supple- mentation with vitamin D and calcium. Another line of evidence for optimal vitamin K 1 intake comes from the evolutionary adaptation to its content in the Paleolithic diet. Studies have looked at many nutritional components of this type of diet and preliminary data suggest that Paleolithic humans were ingest- ing vitamin K 1 in the vicinity of 1.0 mg/day on average.78 It is likely not a coincidence that the Paleolithic levels of vitamin K 1 intake overlap with the amount of vitamin K 1 needed to completely activate Oc. It has been established that vitamin K 1 needs to convert to K 2 (MK-4) to reduce arterial calcification. Aging, genetic polymorphisms, various metabolic factors, and treatment with statins (possibly also with bisphos- phonates) may reduce K 1 to K 2 (MK-4) conversion, thus the need to consider additional supplementation with K 2 (MK-4).

## Versus Therapeutic Strategies

Currently there is no AI set for vitamin K 2, even though blood clot- ting needs may be satisfied by vitamin K 2 (MK-4) or other long-chain menaquinones at physiologically equivalent doses. However, it is not clear whether any form of vitamin K 2 can satisfy all the extrahepatic functions provided by K 1 , simply because not all have been elucidated yet. Vitamin K 2 does not convert to K 1 and many tissues seem to prefer K 1 , because they store much higher levels of K 1 compared with those of K 2 (MK-4). Thus vitamin K 2 may not be used as a substitute for vitamin K 1 needs but may be added to it, based on average evolutionary intake, for basic health support or for therapeutic purposes. The commercially available forms of K 2 are K 2 (MK-4), K 2 (MK-7), or a blend of K 2 (MK- 6, MK-7, MK-9).

## Evolutionary Intake of Vitamin K


The human need for preformed vitamin K 2 may be grounded in an evolutionary perspective of the Paleolithic diet. Its vitamin K 2 content has not been estimated yet, but it was very likely higher than in mod- ern times for several reasons: (a) The modern human’s gut flora may be often impaired owing to therapeutic antibiotic use or antibiotics ingested within animal foods and dairy. (2) The gastrointestinal tract of the Paleolithic human was most likely populated with a larger variety of bacteria producing a fair amount of long-chain vitamin K 2 (MK-n)s. (3) Vitamin K 1 intake was higher and a substrate for intestinal bacteria to produce abundant quantities of K 2 (MK-n). (4) Fiber was also more abundant, which is critical in supporting gastrointestinal bacteria. The only significant dietary sources of long-chain MK-ns for mod- ern humans are cheeses and sauerkraut (in Europe and the United States) or fermented vegetables (kimchi) or soy fermented foods (such as natto, mostly in Asia). The modern content of K 2 (MK-4) in meats may be low because animals are fed mostly corn and not grass. It is unlikely that Paleolithic humans were ingesting any purposely fermented foods, but they may have eaten partially “spoiled” (thus naturally fermented) foods. Dairy foods were probably not often con- sumed, and neither were grains, legumes, or soy foods.78 Average modern intakes of vitamin K 2 (a mix of menaquinoes of various lengths) have been evaluated by a few epidemiological studies in European populations at 29.1 mcg. On the other hand, K 2 (MK-7) has been consumed traditionally in Japan (by approximately 42% of the pop- ulation) at average levels of 58 mcg/day, with the upper range up to mcg/day. This level of K 2 (MK-7) is typically derived from consuming an average of 400 mcg per serving of natto (one to three times per week). As discussed earlier, the correlations found between intake of vita- min K (as K 2 and/or K 1 ) and CVD mortality, overall mortality, or fracture risk are conflicting, with some studies pointing to vitamin K 1 and others to vitamin K 2 to be the form that has more potential to be protective and therapeutic. However, the range of intakes of vitamin K reported by these studies are much lower than intakes able to support complete carboxylation of Oc or lower dp-ucMGP to a large degree. In conclusion, it is not possible to make a recommendation for the amounts and forms of vitamin K 2 that may provide basic health bene- fits when added to an optimal intake of 1 mg of K 1 .

## Therapeutic Dosage of Vitamin K


Vitamin K 2 may be conditionally essential for certain organs and cer- tain individuals who have difficulty converting vitamin K 1 to vitamin K 2 because of age-related changes, those who need intensive interven- tion for certain disease states, or have genetic polymorphisms. If the supplementation goal is to try to compensate for the poor vitamin K 1 to vitamin K 2 (MK-4) conversion, then a dose around mg/day of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) may be appropriate, knowing that 90% of 1 mg vitamin K 1 may convert to vitamin K 2 (MK-4) by the time it is stored inside various tissues. If the supplementation goal is a major therapeutic intervention for osteopenia, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, arterial calcification, a high dose may be used, such as 45 mg/day, the same as in the drug form Glakay. This was prescribed in Japan for more than 20 years and was proven effective especially for bone and cardiovascular health. The mg of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) should be administered in 15 mg doses, three times daily for optimal utilization.

## 947CHAPTER 126 Vitamin K

Therapeutic doses of vitamin K 2 (MK-7) have not been proven more effective than those with vitamin K 1 or vitamin K 2 (MK-4).

# SAFETY

No upper level of toxicity (UL) has been established for vitamin K 1 , even though it belongs to the family of fat-soluble vitamins, which all have a UL because of their typical tendency to be stored and accu- mulated in various organs. This may be because vitamin K 1 is rapidly metabolized out of the plasma and the majority is excreted via bile and urine (50% and 20%, respectively) within a day, with complete excretion of the rest in about 3 days. No evidence has been found so far of toxic accumulation anywhere in the body. A level of 1 mg vita- min K 1 per day may be considered intrinsically safe because it could be normally derived from diets high in leafy greens, seeds, oils, and some organ meats. Will such very high intakes increase clotting excessively? Some studies suggest that once the liver clotting factors are maximized (by complete carboxylation), no amount of excess vitamin K 1 or K 2 can increase clotting performance any further.182 Whenever supplementation with vitamin K is initiated, most peo- ple will experience an increase in clotting factors because a large pro- portion (60%–70%) of the population has a vitamin K intake below the optimal clotting requirement. However, vitamin K also supports the activation of anticlotting proteins that keep overall clotting ten- dencies in an optimal range (proteins C, Z, S). One study looked at the effects of supplementing postmenopausal women with 45 mg of vita- min K 2 (MK-4) and found that although clotting markers increased, the anticlotting activity increased as well; thus the clotting balance was maintained.90 Numerous 2- to 3-year studies have employed doses of 45 mg and even 90 mg of vitamin K 2 (MK-4) for various interventions and none have reported clotting or thrombotic abnormalities. Regarding vitamin K 1 , there are only a few short-term studies that supplemented with vitamin K 1 doses from 500 mcg up to 10 mg, and they have not reported clotting or thrombogenic abnormalities. The Japanese studies that used 45 to 90 mg of vitamin K 2 (MK- 4) have not noted any side effects, which were closely monitored as a result of the drug status of this formulation.

# SUMMARY

The current paradigm shift in vitamin K knowledge is very similar to that of vitamin D, for which there is also a big discrepancy between the fast-accumulating new research and the outdated AI and UL or therapeutic guidelines. Many researchers who performed recent reviews of vitamin K 1 and K 2 call for establishing a higher AI and for more research to be done to further clarify vitamin K physiology and provide more evidence for clinical applications. However, there is no consensus on what the new AI for vitamin K should be and on what doses of vitamin K 1 and/or K 2 may be used effectively and safely for therapeutic purposes. It certainly makes sense to recommend acquiring as much vitamin K as possible from one’s diet in a balance of all forms: K 1 , K 2 (MK-4), and some long-chain K 2 (MK-n) from fermented foods. Another aspect to address is the health of the intestinal tract, to allow adequate amounts of K 2 (MK-n) to be derived from intestinal bacterial production. In that respect, avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic treatments and favoring grass-fed animal products would be helpful. Vitamin K may be supplemented for two major purposes: 1. For complementing the patient’s dietary deficiencies and correct- ing any physiological deficiencies of vitamin K 1 , K 2 (MK-4), and various long-chain menaquinones. In most cases, it makes sense to supplement with 1 mg vitamin K 1 as a foundation, and add small amounts of a variety of menaquinones. 2. For therapeutic purposes, the best evidence is available for 1 and mg vitamin K 1 and 45 mg MK-4 (as discussed in the osteoporosis and CVD sections). In this application the patient must be closely monitored for potential side effects and dose adjustments. Another important aspect to consider is the dose distribution of vitamin K intake throughout the day. For example, a once-a-day high dose of vitamin K 1 or K 2 may not be metabolized properly and may be more likely to have unwanted side effects. One has to keep in mind that for vitamin K 1 supplementation to realize some of its physiological roles in extrahepatic tissues, it may have to be cleaved to form vitamin K 3 by the intestinal cells or convert peripherally to vitamin K 2 in vari- ous tissues and organs. Dietary fat stimulates biliary and pancreatic secretions, so it would be best to incorporate a reasonable amount of fat (for example, 30 g) with the meal ingested at the same time as a vitamin K supplement. In natural foods, vitamin K 1 is bound in the thykaloid membranes of chloroplasts, whereas mechanical processing, such as blending, juic- ing, or cooking may further enhance vitamin K 1 bioavailability from food. The bottom line is that vitamin K 1 or K 2 requirements may vary between individuals based on their particular genetics, health status, dietary habits, and health goals. Ideally (only theoretical at this time), vitamin K status should be at the level that supports optimal activity for all vitamin K-related func- tions. Therapeutic supplementation with supraphysiological doses of vitamin K has great potential for the reversal of severe diseases through complex effects. Patients should be monitored for various side effects and interactions with other pharmaceutical drugs, such as statins and bisphosphonates, and through specific vitamin K status tests and other tests relevant to vitamin K action pathways, as discussed previously in the “Status Biomarkers and Commercially Available Assessments” Section.

## 949CHAPTER 127 Vitamin Toxicities and Therapeutic Monitoring

One 9.5-year prospective cohort study involving almost 35,000 postmenopausal women with hip and other fractures found little evi- dence of an increased risk of fracture with higher intakes of vitamin A or retinol. There was also no evidence of a dose-response relationship in hip fracture risk with increasing amounts of vitamin A or retinol from supplements. Furthermore, the results showed no association between vitamin A ingestion from food and supplements or food only and the risk of fractures of any kind.13 Similar results were seen in a 2013 intervention study, where no association was found between long- term high retinol intake (25,000 IU retinyl palmitate/day) and risk for any fracture.14 In another large observational study that included more than 75,000 participants from the Women’s Health Initiative, retinol and vitamin A intake were not significantly associated with either hip or total fracture incidence among postmenopausal women. However, women in the highest quintile of retinol and vitamin A intake who also had a low intake of vitamin D did have a modestly (15%–20%) increased total fracture risk.15 A smaller study that enrolled Spanish postmenopausal women did find an independent risk for osteoporosis among those with the highest vitamin A intake, but this risk was mag- nified when combined with low vitamin D levels.16 More recently, an analysis of data from 6481 subjects from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination survey revealed that total hip and femoral BMD were positively correlated with dietary vitamin A intake in sub- jects with serum 25-OH vitamin D levels >75 nmol/L.17 However, in men with serum 25-OH vitamin D levels <50 nmol/L, both top and bottom tertiles of vitamin A intake were associated with lower BMD. A similar U-shaped relationship between blood retinol levels and hip fractures was noted in 2014 and 2017 meta-analyses, in which both low and high levels of vitamin A had a negative effect on bone.18,19 The interaction between high vitamin A and low vitamin D levels appears biologically plausible, as vitamin A may antagonize some of vitamin D’s actions, including calcium absorption.20 This may be relevant not only to bone health but possibly to susceptibility to respiratory infec- tion as well.21

Interestingly, a 2015 Dutch prospective study in elderly men and women (the Rotterdam study) indicated that dietary vitamin A intake was associated with a higher BMD and lower fracture risk and vitamin D intake or status did not appear to modify these effects.22 However, the favorable association between vitamin A and BMD disappeared after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). Additionally, when strat- ified for BMI categories, the positive association between vitamin A intake and fracture risk was only present in overweight subjects and not normal weight subjects. A 2007 review of the bone effects of vitamin A concluded that the poor sensitivity of laboratory markers and assessment of dietary intake may contribute to the conflicting findings; it suggested that future studies incorporate superior analytic techniques, specifically stable-isotope-dilution methodology.23 Although serum retinol is often employed to screen for vitamin A toxicity, it is thought to have poor sensitivity because it is subject to homeostatic control over a wide range of intakes as well as hepatic concentrations, and thus does not necessarily represent liver stores.24 Additionally, many clinical fac- tors interfere with its accuracy. One alternative is the measurement of fasting retinyl ester concentrations. When more than 5% to 10% of circulating vitamin A is in the form of retinyl esters, it may indicate either hepatic storage capacity or the capacity of the retinol-binding protein has been exceeded. Unfortunately, elevated retinyl esters do not necessarily indicate impaired liver function and are not sensitive to subclinical toxicity.22,25 Although expensive and not widely available, stable isotope dilution techniques appear to correlate well with values determined by liver biopsy and may emerge as the best marker of total vitamin A stores in both deficiency and toxicity. Indeed, variations of this method may be used to determine the intake needed to maintain target body storage levels. In animal models they have shown 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis of hypervitaminosis A.26,27 Although the deuterated retinol dilution method has been validated in both chil- dren and adults to give a quantitative estimate of internal stores, it needs further verification among diverse populations and greater accessibility.28 When large doses of vitamin A are being given, careful monitoring is necessary. Rather than sudden ingestion of large doses, a gradual stepwise increase in dosage is indicated, with an evaluation of symp- toms made before the dosage is increased. Usually, the first symptom of hypervitaminosis to be recognized is frontal headache. If signs or symptoms appear, supplementation should be discontinued until they disappear. Levels of liver enzymes should be determined periodically to check for hepatic damage. Typically, levels of aspartate transaminase are the first to be affected.1,2,29,30 Patients whose liver function is com- promised by viral hepatitis, protein-energy malnutrition, cirrhosis, or hemodialysis seem to be the most vulnerable to vitamin A toxicity and to require close monitoring.4 Finally, as a result of the conflicting results in studies on vitamin A and bone health, anyone consuming large doses of vitamin A longterm should ensure adequate vitamins D and K 2 levels and be monitored for any bone density changes.

## Carotenoids

Carotenoids appear to be without toxic effects at the therapeu- tic doses customarily used. The only effect of large dosages is an apparently benign yellowing of the skin. While carotenoid toxicity is limited, there is concern that some individuals have difficulty con- verting carotenoids to vitamin A and may be more prone to vitamin A deficiency.31–33 Several large, widely publicized therapeutic trials with synthetic beta-carotene have found that it appears to raise the risk of lung cancer in heavy smokers. It may also pose an increased risk for gastric cancer, particularly among smokers and those exposed to asbestos.34 However, several factors complicate the interpretation of these results. The sig- nificance of these trials is fully discussed in Chapter 57.

## Vitamin D

Significant advances have been made in understanding the role and importance of vitamin D in human health. The recent implications of vitamin D deficiency in a number of chronic diseases has led to an eightyfold increase in physician requests for serum vitamin D concen- tration measurements between the years 2000 and 2010.35 Deficiency is now known to be widespread, with suboptimal levels much more prevalent than toxicity. The use of 25-OH vitamin D is widely accepted as a reliable biomarker, with most indicators suggesting that a level of 75 to 110 nmol/L (or 30–44 ng/mL) is sufficient, although some studies indicate that even higher levels may be optimal.36,37 Unfortunately, the majority of US adolescents and adults do not sustain vitamin D levels within this range. A 2009 study indicated that only 23% of the pop- ulation had serum 25-OH vitamin D levels higher than 75 nmol/L.38 Therefore the evaluation of vitamin D levels should be part of a normal annual preventative checkup. Those in northern latitudes with less sun exposure, as well as the elderly whom have a lower the capacity for vitamin D production, warrant special attention. The upper limits of 25-OH vitamin D are not clearly established, although levels less than 250 nmol/L are considered safe.39 Therapeutic strategies should target 25-OH vitamin D levels rather than a specific supplemental dose, as the effect of supplementation on serum levels varies considerably between individuals. Doses between 2000 IU and 4000 IU will bring the majority of individuals within the range of 75 to 110 nmol/L and are without adverse effects.35,40,41 Nevertheless, some will require higher dosing, and this is also a consideration for indi- viduals with less functional vitamin D receptor polymorphisms. The Endocrine Society, as well as others, suggest levels up to and including 10,000 IU vitamin D (a dose equivalent to full-body sunlight exposure) will maximize physiological benefits and are safe.42–44 According to researchers, there are three major hypotheses for vita- min D toxicity: (1) raised plasma 1,25-OH vitamin D concentrations lead to increased intracellular 1,25-OH vitamin D concentrations (not a popular hypothesis as a result of levels of 1,25(OH)D being normal or only marginally elevated in vitamin D toxicity); (2) vitamin D intake raises plasma 25-OH vitamin D levels to concentrations that exceed DBP binding capacity, and “free” 25-OH vitamin D has direct effects on gene expression once it enters target cells; (3) vitamin D intake raises the concentrations of many vitamin D metabolites and these concentrations exceed the DBP binding capacity and release free 1,25- OH vitamin D, which enters target cells.45,46 Vitamin D intoxication manifests primarily as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria as a result of vitamin D’s ability to increase calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms can include gas- trointestinal (nausea, vomiting, constipation), neurological (confu- sion, lethargy, fatigue), musculoskeletal (muscle weakness and bone pain), cardiovascular (cardiac arrhythmias), and nephrotic (polyuria, polydipsia, and renal calculi) effects. In extreme cases, renal failure can occur.47 Testing for vitamin D toxicity should include 25-OH vitamin D levels as well as serum calcium levels. It has also been suggested that hypercalciuria may be a more sensitive indicator of vitamin D toxicity than hypercalcemia.42 A recent randomized, double-blind clinical trial indicated that hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia “episodes” occurred more frequently when participants were consuming 10,000 to 12,000 IU/day of vitamin D 3 compared with 600 to 800 IU/day when coad- ministered with 2000 mg of calcium. However, these incidences were not associated with kidney stone formation or other adverse effects.48 As a result of its wide therapeutic index, vitamin D intoxication is rare and is usually caused by manufacturing errors or incorrect/inap- propriate administration.49,50 In a review of case reports of vitamin D

## 951CHAPTER 127 Vitamin Toxicities and Therapeutic Monitoring

toxicity spanning over 8 decades, only 13 laboratory-confirmed reports of vitamin D toxicity were found.46 Of these 13 case studies, doses resulting in toxicity in children under the age of 5 were between 20,000 to 800,000 IU/day. Doses resulting in toxicity in adults ranged from 50,000 to 2,604,000 IU/day. The most common symptoms of toxic- ity were loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered sensorium. In these cases, serum 25-OH vitamin D concentrations were greater than 150 ng/mL and total calcium levels ranged from 11.1 to 23.08 mg/dL. Another report on data from calls to US poison centers confirmed that serious medical outcomes from vitamin D ingestion were rare (0.02%) and the most common clinical effects were gastrointestinal and mild neurological effects. They did note, however, that there was a 1600% increase in reported exposures in 2005 to 2011 compared with to 2005.49 Doses as high as 40,000 IU per day have not been associated with toxicity.36 However, very high single doses (500,000 IU in a single annual dose) have been associated with an increased risk for fracture and falls in a temporal pattern, with the highest risk in the period after administration.51 A 2018 study investigating the effect of monthly doses of 100,000 IU of vitamin D 3 over 3 to 4 years on cardiovascular disease, respiratory infections, and fall and fractures did not find any increased incidences of adverse effects with vitamin D supplementa- tion compared with placebo.52 However, there was a tendency to report more dizziness in the vitamin D group. Thus lower doses given more frequently (i.e., more physiologically) are preferred. Despite ongoing controversy, vitamin D 3 appears to be more potent and to produce greater storage than D 2 .53 Oftentimes vitamin D hypersensitivity is mistaken for vitamin D toxicity. For example, granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis, warrant special concern because these individuals are more susceptible to hypercalcemia. Although many have low levels of 25-OH vitamin D (which appears to increase the risk for sarcoidosis), they also have elevated levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and thus require careful management.54Apparently there is overconversion of 25-OH vitamin D 3 to 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D 3 by macrophages in granulomatous dis- ease.55 Primary hyperparathyroidism is another example. In this case production of 1,25-OH vitamin D is upregulated by the high parathy- roid hormone concentrations.43 Patients with Mycobacterium infec- tions and those treated with thiazide diuretics should also be closely monitored if supplementing with vitamin D because of the potential of these populations being vitamin D sensitive.42

## Vitamin E

Although for many years observational studies found vitamin E supplementation to be safe, several controlled trials have been pub- lished suggesting harm with supplementation. For example, in a large meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials in which partic- ipants were given between 50 and 800 IU natural or synthetic vitamin E per day, supplementation was found to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke by 10% but to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke by 22%.56 Similarly, a meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that supplementation with more than 400 IU vitamin E increased all-cause mortality.57 A 2012 Cochrane review also concluded that vita- min E seemed to increase all-cause mortality58; however, this analysis has been criticized by others for excluding hundreds of studies that had zero mortality.59 In addition, most vitamin E research is performed with synthetic vitamin E, which is a DL racemic mixture and/or only alpha-tocopherol. Although the use of synthetic versus natural vitamin E may explain some of the increase in adverse effects, the natural but incomplete form of vitamin E (d-alpha tocopherol) used in many clinical trials is not without risk. For example, supplementation with natural vitamin E at 400 IU per day was associated with an increased risk of heart fail- ure among patients with diabetes or vascular disease.60 The vitamin E family includes eight isomers. As discussed next, high dosages of a single isomer competes with the absorption of the others. An explanation that appears more plausible is that despite the physiological benefits of alpha-tocopherol, high-dose supplementa- tion depletes other forms of naturally occurring vitamin E, such as beta- or gamma-tocopherol, or tocotrienols, which have greater physi- ological significance. For example, in an observational study of elderly patients, higher plasma levels of beta-tocopherol were associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer disease, whereas other forms of vitamin E were only marginally significant.61 The use of both gamma- and alpha-tocopherol in patients with the metabolic syndrome was shown to be superior to either used alone. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that alpha-tocopherol not only failed to demonstrate anticancer properties but also blocked the anticancer effects of gamma-tocopherol.62,63 Gamma-tocopherol is actually more prevalent than the alpha form in the US diet as well as in many plant seeds, although the vast majority of trials and available products use alpha-tocopherol.64 Tocotrienols have been shown to have superior antioxidant capabilities than alpha-tocopherol.65,66 Thus it may not be “vitamin E” that has the harmful effects mentioned previously, but rather the isolated use of alpha-tocopherol. As such, researchers have called for manuscripts to be titled with the specific form of the vitamin rather than the umbrella term “vitamin E.”67 Additional fac- tors are likely to have an influence as well, such as age and vitamin C intake.68 Genetics are also likely to play a role, as diabetic patients with the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype are more likely to receive benefit from supplementation.69 Unfortunately, most laboratory evaluations of vitamin E’s toxicity are based on alpha-tocopherol plasma or serum levels and thus may not be helpful in determining toxicity. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) established by the Institute of Medicine for vitamin E, which refers to all stereoisomers, is based on the potential risk of bleeding. However, it has been suggested that vitamin E only affects coagulation if vitamin K deficiency is also present.70,71 Conflicting evidence and a lack of long-term studies adequately analyzing vitamin E’s toxicity leaves much to be known about vitamin E and its true safety profile.


Synthetic water-soluble vitamin K 3 , menadione, is thought to inter- fere with the antioxidant glutathione, resulting in oxidative damage to cell membranes.72 Large doses of menadione administered to infants may cause liver damage and destruction of red blood cells resulting in hemolytic anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and possibly death. Adults with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may show hemolytic reactions.73 This form vitamin K is no longer used in the United States due to these toxic effects. The natural vitamin K 1 (phylloquinone) and the menaquinones (MK-4, MK-7) do not appear to cause toxicity when given orally unless huge doses (e.g., 200 mg) are given.74 In fact, no tolerable upper intake level for vitamin K has been established as a result of the lack of adverse effect data. Dr. Bruce Ames, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, has provided compelling evidence for the triage theory; that given a suboptimal intake, vitamin K is shunted to basic functions nec- essary for survival at the expense of less essential functions, which are likely to be associated with aging and chronic disease. Given that many individuals have suboptimal vitamin K intake, supplementation with menaquinones has the potential to reduce the incidence of chronic disease.75 All forms of vitamin K can interfere with some anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), and should be used with

caution. Given that the menaquinones may have greater potency than vitamin K 1 , an upper limit of 50 mcg/day (MK-7) has been proposed for those patients on anticoagulant therapy.76 However, the longer half-life of MK-7 (compared with other forms of vitamin K) may help maintain a more stable international normalized ratio while also pro- tecting these patients from the arterial calcification and osteoporosis for which they are at increased risk.77

## Water-Soluble Vitamin Toxicity

## Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)

Vitamin C has been reported to have perhaps the lowest toxicity of all vitamins. Linus Pauling and colleagues began using vitamin C in therapeutic doses—10 g/day intravenously (IV) and orally—in the 1970s and 1980s for cancer patients without toxic effects. Almost a half a decade later, IV vitamin C has been used in Phase I and Phase I/ II trials and is widely used in integrative settings both alone and in combination with chemotherapy. A 2014 review of IV vitamin therapy studies that utilized 1 g to more than 200 g ascorbic acid per infusion 2 to 3 times per week confirmed vitamin C’s modest, but inconsistent, therapeutic benefit in cancer patients as well as its excellent safety pro- file.78 Although one study found IV vitamin C associated with a small increase in urinary oxalate excretion, no related adverse events were noted. The most common adverse events reported were nausea, head- ache, diarrhea, and flushing. There were a few cases of hypernatremia and hypokalemia and one incident of kidney stone in a patient with a previous history of kidney stones. In a similar 2018 review of patients using IV vitamin C therapy, the adverse event rate was only 1% and included mild events such as nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, perspiration, and weakness.79 Diarrhea, intestinal distention, and gas are the most common com- plaints when vitamin C is consumed orally at higher dosages. These effects are rare at doses of 2 g/day or less. It has been shown that high doses of vitamin C can: • Increase the urinary excretion of calcium, iron, and manganese • Increase the absorption of iron • Raise urinary oxalate or uric acid levels, but only in a small sub- group of the population (This may vary with the form of vitamin C, as ester-C has been shown to reduce oxalate levels in a crossover study.80) • Alter many routine laboratory parameters (e.g., serum vitamin B 12 , aminotransferases, bilirubin, glucose, stool occult blood) Clinicians must take these effects into consideration when supple- menting with megadoses of vitamin C. Also, the ability of oral vitamin C to increase plasma levels is limited, with IV administration of vita- min C having been shown to raise levels seventyfold higher.81 Even at the high plasma levels documented with IV therapy, toxicity does not appear to be a significant concern. One concern with high dosages of vitamin C often cited in the med- ical literature is the development of calcium oxalate kidney stones. As mentioned previously, various forms of ascorbic acid may negate this effect, as demonstrated with ester-C versus ascorbic acid. Additionally, in vitro oxidation of ascorbic acid to oxalic acid during storage or analysis is thought to be a common confounder in these studies. Nonetheless, 500 mg/day may be a reasonable limit for those prone to stone formation.82 With regard to IV administration of vitamin C, less than 0.5% of a 100-g dose was converted to oxalic acid in individuals with normal renal function, much less than might be expected from such a large dose.83 A second, more theoretical concern about vitamin C relates to its excess use in progressive inflammatory diseases such as rheuma- toid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. It is theorized that available sur- plus vitamin C may interact with metal ions, eliciting a prooxidant consequence.84 Alternatively, more recent data suggest that vitamin C may chelate metal ions, actually reducing their ability to generate reac- tive oxygen species, and animal models suggest that megadosing may reduce inflammation.85,86 Although no clinical information is avail- able to clarify this concern, it may be prudent to consider limiting the megadosing of vitamin C in patients with unresponsive or worsening chronic inflammatory conditions and to be cautious about giving large doses of vitamin C to patients with known conditions of iron or cop- per excess. This may also be relevant to the dietary intake of iron. For example, high dietary heme intake among women taking more than 500 mg vitamin C per day was found to increase the risk of lung cancer, whereas high zinc intake reduced the risk.87 There have been reports that abrupt cessation of high-dose vita- min C intake leads to rebound scurvy, which has also been reported to occur after birth in the babies of pregnant women who have been taking high doses. However, other studies do not support the existence of rebound scurvy under these conditions. Although some experts question the existence of rebound scurvy, it is better to err on the side of caution. At this time a safe recommendation to pregnant women would be a daily dosage of 500 mg vitamin C.

## Folic Acid (Vitamin B

Although generally considered safe, caution should be exercised in supplementing with folic acid in the presence of a vitamin B 12 defi- ciency. Although folic acid will correct a macrocytosis, it will not cor- rect the underlying neurological degeneration caused by vitamin B 12 deficiency. Additionally, high folic acid levels appear to accentuate the toxicity of low vitamin B 12 .88,89 High-dose folic acid (15 mg/day) has been used without adverse effects in several studies. For example, when given as 5-methyltetra- hydrofolate to postmenopausal women, it significantly reduced their blood pressure and homocysteine levels and improved their insulin sensitivity.90 Folic acid given at 5 mg/day with vitamins B 12 and B 6 was found to reduce subclinical atherosclerosis among individuals with a fasting homocysteine level greater than 9.0 μ mol/L when given over years. This was a randomized placebo-controlled trial with more than 500 participants, and no difference in adverse effects between groups was cited.91 A meta-analysis also found that folic acid supplementation reduced the risk of stroke in primary prevention, especially when con- tinued for a longer period of time.92 A very important placebo-controlled randomized trial, published in 2008, found that folic acid given at 5 mg/day over 3 years reduced the recurrence of colorectal adenomas; the recurrence rate in the placebo group was twice as high as in the folic acid group. Additionally, none of the patients who received folic acid were found to have histologi- cally aggressive adenomas or carcinoma at their final endoscopy.93 This study is particularly relevant because concerns have been raised that both low and high folate levels may increase the risk of cancer.94,95 For example, in two previous trials, folic acid given at 1 mg/day was associ- ated with more advanced colorectal lesions as well as an increased risk of prostate cancer.96,97 It is possible that the high folic acid content of fortified foods can be a confounding variable when a low dose of 1 mg/ day is used. Additionally, there is most likely a difference between syn- thetic folic acid and the more natural reduced and methylated forms, primarily 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate. In 2015 the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) partnered with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and convened an expert panel to evaluate the current state of science surrounding the safe use of folic acid at levels above the RDA. They prioritized four general health categories that had areas of uncertainty when considering the safe use of folic acid: cancer, cognition in conjunction with vitamin B 12 deficiency, hypersensitivity-related outcomes, and thyroid and

diabetes-related disorders. The panel did not identify conclusive evi- dence of adverse effects of folic acid; however, they did conclude that more research could be done on all of the topics. With respect to folic acid and cancer, the expert panel indicated there was a “consistent enough suggestion in human studies of an adverse effect on cancer growth from supplemental folic acid to justify further research.”98 Until a more definitive conclusion exists on folic acid supplemen- tation and the risk of cancer, it seems prudent to limit folic acid sup- plementation to the RDA unless the benefits outweigh the risks. It is important to point out that folate from food is not a concern. Finally, a serum folate level greater than 45.3 nmol/L is often used to define elevated levels, but it is arbitrarily chosen because of technical difficulties in analysis rather than a functional toxicity.99

## Niacin (Vitamin B

## )

The acute side effects of niacin (nicotinic acid) are well known. The most common and bothersome is the skin flushing that typically occurs 20 to minutes after the niacin is taken. A gradual increase in daily dose and/or administration of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 30 minutes to 1 hour before taking niacin can help reduce the flushing effect of niacin.100,101 Long-term consequences of niacin therapy include gastric irritation, nausea, jaundice, and liver damage. Other rare complications include cardiovascular (palpitations, tachycardia) and ocu- lar (blurred vision, cystoid macular edema) effects.100 In an attempt to combat the acute reaction of skin flushing, several manufacturers began marketing “sustained-release,” “timed-release,” and “slow-release” niacin products. These formulations allow the nia- cin to be absorbed gradually, thereby reducing the flushing reaction. However, although these forms of niacin reduce skin flushing, they have actually proved to be more toxic to the liver, particularly the slow-release products. One study strongly recommended that the use of slow-release niacin be restricted because of the high percentage (78%) of patient with- drawals from the study because of side effects; 52% of the patients taking the sustained-release niacin had liver damage compared with none of the patients taking immediate-release niacin.102 “Extended-release (ER)” niacin (Niaspan) appears to have similar toxicity as immediate-release niacin, with a 2008 review documenting that significant increases in liver enzymes with either extended- or immediate-release niacin are rare and that elevations leading to severe hepatotoxicity occur rarely, if at all.103 A 2014 review of the safety profile of Niaspan in the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) trial indicated that there were no significant differences in number of serious adverse events between the extended-release niacin and placebo and the rate of serious hemorrhagic events were low.104 Niacin has also been shown to cause a 4% to 5% increase in fast- ing glucose and a 20% to 28% reduction in insulin sensitivity. For this reason it should be used with caution in diabetic patients and those at risk for diabetes. However, its cardiovascular benefit often significantly outweighs the risk, even in these patients. In a 2010 meta-analysis published in Atherosclerosis, nicotinic acid given alone or in combi- nation was associated with a reduction in the risk of coronary events and stroke (approximately by 75%) as well as positive effects on the evolution of atherosclerosis when used at 1 to 3 g/day. The authors of this analysis also point out that it reduces low-density-lipoprotein cho- lesterol to a similar degree as statin medications, and is the only effec- tive therapy for reducing lipoprotein (a).105 When extended-release niacin was given to diabetic patients at 1000 to 1500 mg/day, it was associated with only a 0.3% increase in hemoglobin A 1c compared with placebo, with a dose-dependent improvement in levels of triglycerides and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. However, increases in diabe- tes medications may have prevented a larger increase in hemoglobin A 1c .106 Given that improving high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol is a primary goal in diabetes, the use of nicotinic acid is often indicated for these patients.107 Side effects can occur with any form of niacin, including niacin- amide. Although niacinamide does not cause the acute flushing of the skin, it can also cause liver damage and has not demonstrated the same benefit to lipid profiles as nicotinamide. Inositol hexani- acinate is an alternative form of niacin that may have very few side effects, but large, well-designed studies to document its benefit are lacking.108 Regardless of the form of niacin being used, periodic checking (at least every 3 months) of liver function is indicated when high-dose (i.e., 2–6 g/day) niacin, inositol hexaniacinate, or niacinamide ther- apy is being used. Niacin should be used with caution in patients with preexisting liver disease or elevation in liver enzyme values, gout, or peptic ulcers. Physicians should also be aware of the promotion and use of niacin as an agent to influence urine drug screens. Several case reports have been published on severe niacin toxicity caused by large doses being consumed for this purpose.109,110

Vitamin B 6 is one of the few water-soluble vitamins that is associated with toxicity when taken in large doses or in moderate dosages for long periods, and it is known to cause a transient sensory neuropathy. Large doses of vitamin B 6 are currently being used for a wide variety of conditions. Doses greater than 1000 mg/day can produce symptoms of nerve toxicity (tingling sensations in the feet, loss of muscle coordination, and degeneration of nerve tissue) in some individuals, with ataxia being the clinical hallmark of vitamin B 6 hypervitaminosis.111 Long- term intake of dosages greater than 500 mg/day can be toxic if taken daily for several months.112 There are also a few rare reports of toxicity occurring at chronic long-term dosages as low as 150 mg/day.113–115 One animal study reports the increased possibility of nerve toxicity in individuals with renal failure who have uremia, owing to decreased pyridoxine excretion, which induces an increase in susceptibility to pyridoxine-induced neuropathy.116 Because patients with renal failure are commonly given long-term pyridoxine therapy, caution is advised, and it is prudent to look for neuropathic signs in pyridoxine-supple- mented uremic patients with renal failure. Although rare, it has also been reported that pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) therapy can exac- erbate blood clotting disorders, such as hemophilia, so it is import- ant that a clinician be prudent in using vitamin B 6 therapy in those patients.117 Toxicity is thought to occur when supplemental pyridoxine over- whelms the liver’s ability to add a phosphate group to produce the active form of vitamin B 6 (PLP). As a result, it is speculated that pyridoxine is either toxic to the nerve cells or that it actually acts as an antimetabolite by binding to PLP receptors, thereby creating a relative deficiency of vitamin B 6 . A 2017 in vitro study seemed to confirm both of these hypotheses, demonstrating that pyridoxine sig- nificantly increased neuronal cell death whereas other B vitamers did not.118 When PLP was added to neuronal cells before the addition of pyridoxine, it was able to prevent pyridoxine-induced cell death. Further, it was demonstrated that pyridoxine was able to compet- itively inhibit PLP-dependent enzymes tyrosine decarboxylase and alanine aminotransferase. Some controversy exists suggesting that vitamin B 6 analog contaminants produced during synthesis may be the actual culprits. Doses of pyridoxine should therefore be limited to 50 mg. If more than 50 mg is desired, then the doses should be spread throughout the day or the active form (PLP) could be used.

Vitamin B 12 , a generic term for a group of cobalt-containing corri- noids, has no appreciable toxicity. Vitamin B 12 has a long history of safe, long-term use even at high therapeutic doses (1000 mcg/day for years; 100,000 mcg one time dose).119 In a 1986 study in dialysis patients who could not excrete vitamin B 12 normally, IV doses of 2.5 mg resulted in a fourfold elevation of plasma vitamin B 12 . These lev- els were not associated with any toxic effects.120 Rare allergic/immune reactions have been reported with IV administrations.121

# LABORATORY TESTS FOR VITAMIN TOXICITY

## Corpus Luteum Insufficiency

Corpus luteum insufficiency (also referred to as luteal phase defect) is a manifestation of suboptimal ovarian function. In laboratory terms, corpus luteum insufficiency is usually defined as an abnormally low progesterone level 3 weeks after the onset of menstruation (serum pro- gesterone below 10–12 ng/mL). This state is normal during puberty and at menopause; however, it is usually considered abnormal in women between the ages of 20 and 40 years.12 Corpus luteum insufficiency points to abnormal formation of ovarian follicles, an abnormality that may be so pronounced that no secondary or tertiary follicles are produced, with a resulting lack of ovulation (anovulation). Corpus luteum insufficiency also leads to a relative deficiency of progesterone. Insufficient levels of progesterone may also result in the formation of ovarian cysts. Corpus luteum insufficiency may give rise to a myriad of menstrual abnormalities. Table 128.1 lists the most common clinical conditions in 1592 women diagnosed with corpus luteum insufficiency. Foremost are hypermenorrhea (heavy periods), polymenorrhea (abnormally fre- quent periods), and persistent anovulatory bleeding. Secondary amen- orrhea (lack of a period) may sometimes be observed in women with corpus luteum insufficiency. Disturbances of other hormones may also be associated with cor- pus luteum insufficiency. One study found hyperprolactinemia in 70% of cases.13 Also noted is an exaggerated response to the thyroid- releasing hormone test, which is associated with manifest or latent hypothyroidism.

## Premenstrual Syndrome and Cyclic Mastalgia

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common com- plaints found in gynecology practices. Table 128.2 lists the different subgroups of PMS and the symptoms associated with them. Nearly double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted with Vitex extract in PMS. A meta-analysis of the top eight studies in terms of quality concluded that Vitex extract is a safe and effective treatment HO HO H H O Glucose O

for PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Three differ- ent preparations of Vitex extract were tested, and there was significant variability in the measurement of treatment outcomes between the studies. Nevertheless, all eight studies were positive for Vitex extract in the treatment of PMS or PMDD and Vitex extract was well tolerated. In a double-blind study, 170 women (mean age, 36 years) with a diagnosis of PMS were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg of a Vitex extract (dried ethanolic extract [6–12:1]) or placebo once a day for three menstrual cycles. Twenty-three women were taking oral contraceptives (11 in the Vitex group and 12 in the placebo group) during the study period. At the end of the treatment period, women taking the Vitex extract had a significantly greater reduction in overall PMS symptom score than those taking placebo (P < 0.001). Five of the six self-assessment items indicated a significantly greater reduction for the Vitex group with the exception of the item listed “others and bloating,” which was measured as unaffected by treatment with Vitex. The Clinical Global Impressions (physician’s assessment) also showed a significantly greater reduction in PMS symptoms in the Vitex group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The overall response rate was 52% for the Vitex group compared with 24% for the placebo group.15 One study compared the efficacy of Vitex (3.5–4.2 mg/day of dried fruit extract) with vitamin B 6 (200 mg/day) in 175 women with premenstrual tension syndrome.16 Although both agents were effective (the symptom scale decreased from 15.2 to 5.1 in the Vitex group and from 11.9 to 5.1 in the vitamin B 6 group), 24.5% of subjects reported excellent results for Vitex, compared with only 12.1% for B 6 . However, more than twice as many women (12) reported side effects from Vitex than from vitamin B 6 (5). Two double-blind placebo-controlled studies have been conducted in Chinese women. In one double trial in 67 women, Vitex reduced the premenstrual syndrome diary (PMSD) sum score from 29.38 at baseline to 4.28 at the third cycle in the treatment group.17 In the other double-blind study comprising 208 women in the Vitex group, the mean total PMSD score decreased from 29.23 at baseline to 6.41 at termination (third cycle) for the treatment group and from 28.14 at baseline to 12.64 at termination (third cycle) for the placebo group.18 A placebo effect near 50% was found in both studies. Other studies with Vitex for PMS have been uncontrolled or clinical monitoring trials. A monitoring survey of gynecology practices in Germany examined the effect of Vitex on 1542 women with a diagnosis of PMS.19 The patients’ mean age was 34.7 years, with a range of 13 to 62 years. Additional diagnoses noted in these patients included corpus luteum insufficiency (n = 1016) and uterine fibroids (n = 170). Patients were instructed to take drops per day of a Vitex liquid extract. The average duration of treatment was 166 days. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by both patients and their physicians. These assessments are listed in Table 128.3. In more than 90% of the patients, symptoms were completely relieved, with a report of side effects in only 2% (listed in Table 128.3). Only 17 of the 1542 women studied had to stop treatment because of side effects. Improvement in symptoms began after an average treatment duration of 25.3 days. After completion of the monitoring period, 562 patients continued taking Vitex. Similar results have been reported in three uncontrolled studies.20–23 Vitex has been shown to reduce cyclic breast pain (mastalgia) in many of the PMS studies. In a detailed review of data from random- ized and nonrandomized studies regarding the efficacy and safety of Vitex, the authors concluded that Vitex can be considered a safe and effective agent in the treatment of mastalgia.24 In one double-blind study of 97 patients suffering from cyclic mastalgia, the intensity of mastalgia, as measured by visual analog score, in patients treated with a liquid product combining Vitex with several homeopathic ingredients

significantly decreased after one or two treatment cycles and remained reduced after the third cycle.25 Not only the intensity but also the dura- tion of pain improved on Vitex treatment. In the Vitex group, after two cycles 50% of patients did not have severe pain at all during menstrual cycle. Clinicians should expect it to take three or four cycles for Vitex to work for mastalgia as well.

## Hyperprolactinemia

As mentioned previously, Vitex has shown a modulating effect on pro- lactin and is regarded as a useful agent for the treatment of hyperpro- lactinemia.26 A double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the effect of Vitex on 52 women with luteal phase defects caused by latent hyperprolactinemia. The daily dose of the Vitex extract was 20 mg and the study lasted for 3 months. Hormonal analysis was performed at days 5 through 8 and day 20 of the menstrual cycle before and after months of therapy. After 3 months of therapy, 37 cases were available for analysis (20 placebo and 17 Vitex). Prolactin release was signifi- cantly reduced in the Vitex group. Both shortened luteal phases and deficits in progesterone production were normalized. No side effects were noted, and two women in the Vitex group became pregnant.27

## Infertility and Secondary Amenorrhea

Twenty patients with secondary amenorrhea were enrolled in a 6-month study using Vitex liquid extract at 40 drops daily. Laboratory monitoring of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and LH values as well as Papanicolaou smears were performed before the study and at 3 and 6 months. At the end of the study, data were avail- able in 15 patients. The onset of menstrual cycles was observed with Vitex treatment in 10 of the 15 patients. The hormone values showed increased values for progesterone and LH, but FSH values either did not change or dropped slightly.28 A nonblinded uncontrolled trial studied the effect of Vitex on cor- pus luteum function in 48 infertile women between 23 and 39 years of age. The inclusion criteria were normal prolactin levels (<20 ng/mL), normal results in the prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone tests, and an abnormally low serum progesterone levels (<12.0 ng/mL on the 20th day of the cycle). Treatment consisted of Vitex liquid extract 40 drops daily without any other medication for 3 months. Forty-five women completed the trial (3 were excluded because of concurrent hormone use). The outcome of therapy was assessed through evalua- tion for normalization of the midluteal progesterone level and correc- tion (lengthening) of any preexisting shortening of the phases of the cycle. Treatment was deemed successful in 39 of the 45 patients. Seven women became pregnant, serum progesterone was restored to normal (>12 ng/mL) in 25 patients, and there was a trend toward normaliza- tion of progesterone levels in 7 patients.29 A double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 89 women with infertility, luteal phase defect, or secondary amenorrhea looked at the effect off a liquid Vitex extract (32.4 mg) with homeopathic ingredi- ents on progesterone, LH, and prolactin levels and conception rates over a 3-month span. Of the 66 women evaluated at the end of the study, 31 had normal hormone values. More importantly, 15 women (7 with amenorrhea, 4 with infertility, and 7 with luteal phase defect) conceived during the study.30


The recommended daily dose of Vitex is a dried or liquid extract deliv- ering the equivalent of 30 to 40 mg of the dried fruit a day.31 Vitex is typically taken once in the morning before breakfast; it should be taken for at least three menstrual cycles to evaluate efficacy.


Human and animal studies have determined Vitex to be safe for most women of childbearing age. Vitex is not recommended for use during pregnancy,32 and its use during lactation is being questioned owing to its possible dopaminergic actions, which might lead to a suppression of lactation. The safety of Vitex in children has also not been determined. Data from clinical trials, postmarketing surveillance studies, sur- veys, spontaneous reporting schemes, manufacturers, and herbalist organizations indicate that the adverse events after Vitex treatment are mild and reversible.33,34 The most frequent adverse events are nausea, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, menstrual disorders, acne, pruritus, and erythematous rash. Side effects noted in one large popu- lation study are listed in Table 128.4.


Because of theoretical interactions, some authorities suggest that Vitex be avoided by women taking oral contraceptives or on hormone ther- apy.35 However, two clinical studies have found no adverse interactions in women taking oral contraceptives concomitantly with Vitex.15,23 The potential dopaminergic action of Vitex also suggests that it should not be used concomitantly with dopamine antagonist drugs, such as haloperidol and metoclopramide.

• Lubricant. Water combines with molecules, forming viscous substances that lubricate and protect tissue functions. Examples include the mucus of the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucous membranes, synovial fluid in joints, saliva, tears, etc. • Shock absorber. Within the cell, water takes the structural configu- ration of a gel that maintains cellular shape and form. This property cushions tissues against the shock of movement and mild trauma. Water molecules have an affinity for the electronegative molecules of connective tissue matrix (e.g., chondroitin, keratin, etc.), includ- ing the nucleus pulposus of the vertebral discs. It is the water mol- ecules surrounding the compounds of the connective tissue matrix that provide the cushioning effect.

## Causes of Dehydration

The most common are: • Vomiting • Diarrhea • Blood loss • Malnutrition • Failure to replenish liquids lost from sweating and urination • Among older adults in which dehydration is much more common, lower muscle mass, reduced kidney function, physical and cogni- tive disabilities, blunted thirst, and polypharmacy may all contrib- ute.6 • Other causes include diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetes insipidus, burns, medications, and many others.

# THIRST: THE SENSE THAT CANNOT BE TRUSTED?

The osmoreceptors in the forebrain are sensitive to only certain solutes in the blood (e.g., sodium) but insensitive to others (e.g., urea).7 Thus the osmoreceptors are not accurate gauges of all blood solute concen- trations but directly detect changes to the osmolality of the blood. We now know that these changes are detected by two small structures in the forebrain, outside of the blood–brain barrier, known as the subfor- nical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. The precise mechanism remains unknown but has been speculated to be mediated via stretch-sensitive ion channels embedded in the plasma membranes of specialized neurons in these locations.8 Originally thought to be a limiting factor for optimal hydration, the sense of thirst in the mouth (dryness) is quickly and easily satiated by small amounts of water, stimulating the moisture receptors within the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and upper gastrointes- tinal tract. Now it is understood that thirst is simply not quenched by the same process that initiated it. “Instead, the brain terminates thirst by using sensory cues from the oropharynx to track ongoing water consumption and then estimate how this water intake will alter fluid balance in the future, after the water has been absorbed.”8 Thus thirst is quenched in anticipation of water absorption, likely as a pre- ventative factor for overconsuming water and creating dangerous imbalances.

## Signs and Symptoms of Dehydration

Clinical dehydration is a serious medical condition that must be treated immediately. Here are the indications to look for, though unfortunately most are low reliability indicators, especially in an older population9: • Fatigue and weakness • Headache • Rough, dry skin or tenting of the skin • Dry mucous membranes in the nose, mouth, or throat • Nosebleeds (especially in dry interior air during winter) • Dark, concentrated, strong-smelling urine produced in small quan- tities • Irritability, irrational behavior (altered mental status) • Constipation • Nausea • Intestinal cramps • Weak, irregular pulse • Low blood pressure • Shallow, rapid breathing • Increased capillary refill time • Increased blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, or serum sodium

## Sources of Water for the Body

Human beings derive their water intake from these basic sources: • Beverages (70%–80%) • Foods with high water content (20%–30%) • Liberation of water molecules during oxidative metabolism of food sources10

<!-- chunk -->

## Water Losses From the Body

Water exits the body via several portals: • Skin—insensible perspiration (450 mL daily in temperate cli- mates). Of course, elevations in body temperature can lead to mas- sive increases in water losses in the form of sweat. • Kidneys—1 to 2 L of urine daily. Water loss via urine increases during hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus) as well as in disorders involving antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). • Respiratory mucous membranes—breath (250–350 mL daily). Additional water loss occurs during respiratory infections, which trigger increased discharge of mucous secretions. • Digestive system, including feces (200 mL daily). Dramatic water losses arise from disorders whose symptoms include vomiting and/ or diarrhea. Perspiration is hypotonic; that is, it has lower electrolyte content than plasma or extracellular fluid. This phenomenon means that sweating leads to more water loss than electrolyte loss. As the electro- lyte concentration in the extracellular fluid rises, it draws water out of cells (intracellular fluid), leading to cellular dehydration. This state of hypertonic dehydration demands replenishment with hypotonic beverages, such as pure water. Water need supersedes salt need during endurance exercise.11

<!-- chunk -->

## Factors That Influence Water Need

Water intake requirements vary according to individual needs and cir- cumstances. Some of the factors that affect water need are: • Physical activity/exercise • Metabolism • Diet • Ambient atmospheric temperature • Humidity • Health status

<!-- chunk -->

## Ideal Water Intake

In units of liters per day, the water intake levels recommended by the US Food and Nutrition Board, based on age and gender, are as follows12: • Infants, 0.7 to 0.8 L • Children • 1 to 3 years, 1.3 L • 4 to 8 years, 1.7 L • Males • 9 to 13 years, 2.4 L

## Hydration for Athletes and Laborers

The National Athletic Trainers’ Association has published guidelines for athletic hydration. Here are some highlights of their recommenda- tions that apply equally to “weekend warriors” and those involved in heavy physical labor13: • Establish hydration protocols, accommodating sweat rate, rest breaks, fluid access, environmental factors, acclimatization state, exercise duration and intensity, and personal preferences. • Make fluid-replacement beverages easily accessible in individual containers to permit easier monitoring of fluid intake. • Ensure that athletic activity begins in a well-hydrated state. Preex- ercise hydration entails consuming 500 to 600 mL (17–20 fl oz) of water 2 to 3 hours before exercise and 200 to 300 mL (7–10 fl oz) of water 10 to 20 minutes before exercise. • Replace fluids sufficiently to meet sweat and urine losses and main- tain hydration by preventing at less than 2% body weight reduc- tion. This need requires 200 to 300 mL (7–10 fl oz) every 10 to minutes. • Hydrate postexercise to correct any fluid loss, ideally within 2 hours after exercise. When rehydration must be rapid, compensate for urine losses during rehydration by drinking 25% to 50% more than sweat losses to assure optimal rehydration 4 to 6 hours after exer- cise. • Be alert for signs and symptoms of dehydration—thirst, irritabil- ity, general discomfort, followed by headache, weakness, dizziness, cramps, chills, vomiting, nausea, head or neck heat sensations, and decreased performance. In 2017 this position statement was updated, with a number of changes that recognize the danger of both hypohydration as well as hyperhydration, and that encourage all athletes to develop individu- alized plans to accommodate unique differences in “sweat rate, envi- ronment, acclimatization state, body size, exercise duration, exercise intensity, and individual fluid preferences and tolerance.”14

# PURE WATER VERSUS OTHER BEVERAGES

By definition, osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules from a place of relatively high concentration across a semipermeable membrane to a place of relatively low concentration. The amount of pressure that must be applied against this osmotic movement of water is called osmotic pressure. It is a measure of how vigorously water is attempting to cross the membrane. The differences in water concentration across membranes define the “water concentration gradient” across that membrane. Thus the osmotic pressure is proportional to the concen- tration gradient. The higher the water concentration on one side of the membrane relative to the other side, the higher the osmotic pres- sure and the greater the vigor of movement of water molecules across the membrane. Any solutes dissolved in water outside the membrane decrease the water concentration gradient across the membrane and the vigor of water movement. If the concentration of solutes in the water outside the cell is less than the concentration of solutes within the cell, the concentration of water molecules will be greater outside the cell than within it. Therefore water molecules will move by osmosis down their concentration gradient from the exterior to the interior and the cell will be hydrated.15 Conversely, if the concentration of solutes is higher in the exterior than the interior, water molecules are in higher concentration within the cell. Therefore water molecules will move down their concentra- tion gradient from the interior to the exterior; thus the cell becomes dehydrated. Obviously, the beverage that has the least amount of solutes and therefore the highest osmotic drive to hydrate the body down to the cellular level is pure water. If anything is dissolved in water (coffee, tea, sugar, flavorings, colors, protein, etc.), osmosis is reduced. Body and cell hydration are therefore inhibited by the consumption of beverages containing solutes. Thus the basic principles of physiology indicate that pure water is the beverage of choice for optimal hydration of the body.16 Exceptions to this may be made for athletes participating in events lasting longer than 1 hour (e.g., marathon runners) or those with high sodium sweat concentrations (>60 mEq/L), which may ben- efit from replacement sodium only, not beyond the amount lost.17

# WATER TEMPERATURE

According to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, the con- sumption of cold food and drink is a bane of optimal health and well- ness among Western people. The interior temperature of the body is higher than oral, axillary, or rectal temperature. For example, the inte- rior temperature of the stomach is about 102°F and that of the heart is approximately 106°F. These warm temperatures are appropriate for the optimal physiological functions and biochemical processes that sustain life. The ingestion of large amounts of cold food and bever- ages tends to inhibit these processes. Interestingly, cool water inhibits subfornical organ thirst neurons more effectively than warm, possibly because of a learned association between cooling of the oropharynx and water consumption. For this reason, it is prudent to ensure that water consumed is at room temperature or warmer.

# SPECIAL NEEDS

Particular care must be taken to adequately hydrate people who, because of special circumstances, may need an even greater intake of water than recommended earlier. These persons include the following: • Infants fed high-protein formulas (with caution not to overhydrate infants) • Persons eating high-protein diets • Patients suffering from disorders whose symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory discharges, and other types of water loss • Patients taking diuretics • People living in environments with high atmospheric temperatures

# PHYSIOLOGY OF WATER METABOLISM

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxygen Transport

In the alveoli and in tissue capillaries and connective tissue, water is the medium in which gas exchange occurs. Without the ready solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide in water, gas exchange in living systems would not be possible. Oxygen diffuses from atmospheric air into the water of alveolar tissues and plasma before it associates with hemoglo- bin in red blood cells. After being carried to peripheral tissue capillar- ies, oxygen dissociates from hemoglobin into the water of plasma and connective tissue. Water carries oxygen into the cell through mem- brane aquaporins.18,19

## Role of Water in Protein Structure and Function

The function of a protein is determined by its form—its three- dimensional shape. The unique sequence of amino acids, coded by DNA, determines the shape or form of a protein. That sequence is determined by the sequence of the coding genes on chromosomal DNA that initiate the synthesis of that protein.20 Water molecules provide the environment that not only allows proteins to function but also supports their endeavors in unrecognized ways. To fulfill their respective missions, the amino acid strands of proteins must bend, twist, and contort their primary linear structure into secondary, tertiary, and quaternary forms. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between water and amino acid strands drive the conformational changes needed for proteins to realize their ulti- mate functional shapes. The final shape of a protein is determined by the manner in which water and amino acid strands are bonded to each other. As a lubricating agent, water facilitates the breaking and reestab- lishing of hydrogen bonds and other links between the various parts of protein. Once the appropriate bonding is in place, water molecules are critical to the continued integrity and stability of protein structure.21 It can therefore be suggested that the DNA genetic code is arranged in a fashion that specifically anticipates the conformational interaction of water molecules required to finish protein-generating tasks.22,23

## Cell Hydration and Cell Behavior

Because of the lack of routine techniques for measuring cell hydration and volume in patients, naturopaths and conventional practitioners alike often fail to consider cell hydration state during clinical assess- ment. This is an unfortunate oversight because of the effect of cell hydration state on the behavior of cells. There is evidence that cell hydration state is an important deter- minant of protein and RNA turnover—anabolism and catabolism. It appears that hormones and amino acids modify protein turnover, partly by altering the cell hydration state, which alters cell volume. Changes in cell volume can serve as signals mediating hormone and amino acid effects, which control protein turnover. Increases in cell volume (swelling) inhibit protein catabolism and RNA degradation while stimulating the synthesis of protein, DNA, and RNA. Loss of cell volume (shrinkage) has the opposite effect on RNA, DNA, and protein. Consequently, cell swelling stimulates anabolic proliferative metabolism, whereas cell shrinkage has a catabolic and antiprolifera- tive influence.24,25 In view of the protein catabolism that arises in disease states, researchers have proposed that cell shrinkage or loss of cellular vol- ume caused by a loss of intracellular water volume, as is often seen in skeletal muscle and liver tissue, may be a common endpoint triggering protein catabolism in a variety of disease states.

## Hydration and the Elderly

Dehydration is one of the most common causes of hospitalization among persons over the age of 65. It has been estimated that one half of those admitted for clinical dehydration die within a year of admission. There are many factors leading to clinical and subclinical dehydra- tion among seniors: • Lower body water percentage • Lack of awareness of hydration needs • Lack of mental clarity and attentiveness to personal needs • Illnesses that accelerate water loss by inducing vomiting, fever, and/ or diarrhea • Decline of thirst sensation with age • Higher likelihood of multiple medication usage, including diuret- ics, which increase fluid loss, and or sedating medications, which reduce the desire for fluid intake26 Gradual total body dehydration is a hallmark of the aging process, and occurs in 20% to 30% of older adults.27 In addition, the prepon- derance of body water shifts gradually with age from cell interiors to the exterior connective tissue, and a decline in fat-free mass and mus- cle reduce the fluid reserve from these tissues. Kidney function also declines, limiting the ability to concentrate urine and retain fluid. Even death itself is frequently linked to dehydration. Long-term chronic dis- ease eventually wears the body down to the point where patients can no longer ingest water and food, ultimately succumbing to dehydration. To make matters worse, our sense of thirst declines with age, though the reaction to thirst does not. Researchers have concluded that after water deprivation, “there is a deficit in thirst and water intake in healthy elderly men, compared with younger men.” This is true despite the fact that the antidiuretic hormone response is maintained.28 Chronic “subclinical” dehydration (or “hypohydration”) contrib- utes to the aging process. In its struggle for survival, the body shifts precious resources away from processes that increase longevity toward those needed for short-term survival.

## Winter Hydration

The human body loses water in many ways during winter. Some are obvious; others are not: • Exercising in cold weather mutes the experience of sweating in many people, deceiving them into thinking that their bodies are not losing much water. • Cold air cannot hold as much moisture as warm air. Therefore win- ter air is drier than summer air. The drier air draws more water from the lungs as we breathe, so we exhale more moisture during winter months. • Interior environments are usually very dry in the winter because of the use of dehumidifying heating methods. The decreased interior humidity increases water loss from the lungs and skin. • When the body gets chilled, blood is shifted away from the periph- ery toward the interior organs to preserve vital heat. The shunting of blood to the interior increases renal arterial flow, glomerular fil- tration rate, and urine output. This effect is called cold diuresis. • Cold weather increases body metabolism and the associated water needs required to maintain healthy body temperature. • Respiratory illnesses of winter cause the body to generate large amounts of mucus to dispose of pathogens. The water in these dis- charges must be replaced. • Intestinal influenza, with diarrhea and vomiting, requires addi- tional water and perhaps electrolyte replacement.

## Dehydration and Jet Lag

The cabin atmospheric pressure of modern passenger jets is equiva- lent to that found on land at an elevation of 8000 ft above sea level. Although the relative humidity of the Sahara Desert is typically 20% to 25%, the humidity of jet cabin air can be as dry as 1% to 10%. For these reasons, dehydration is a major factor in the experience of jet lag. People should keep thoroughly hydrated with pure water and avoid the other beverages offered by flight attendants. It is prudent to drink at least 8 ounces of pure water per hour.

## Effect of Hydration State on Blood Flow

Whole-blood viscosity has been identified as an independent risk fac- tor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. The most dangerous time of day for heart attack is the last period of sleep and the first few hours in the morning after awakening. A number of factors may play

## 963CHAPTER 129 Water: The Most Basic Nutrient and Therapeutic Agent

a role in this trend; hydration state may be one of them. Overnight fasting from fluid intake increases blood viscosity and adversely affects blood flow (rheology) to major organs. Consumption of 200 mL of water under these circumstances helps normalize blood flow to major organs.29

## Cognitive-Motor Function and Hydration State

In young adults, neither cognitive-motor function nor neurophysio- logical function differs between people under water deprivation and controls. On the other hand, subjective ratings of mental performance during water deprivation point to increased fatigue as well as impaired alertness and the concentration needed to complete tasks. Healthy people tend to employ compensating mechanisms for increased fatigue and reduced alertness. Test of reaction time reveal significant gender differences in the response to dehydration. Water deprivation induces a prolonged reaction time in women but a shortened one in men.30

## Multiple-Organ-System Effects of Chronic Subclinical

<!-- chunk -->

## Dehydration

The insidious effects of chronic hypohydration are wide ranging and staggering. Consider the following effects: • Disintegration of cellular structure • Impaired flow of nutrients into the cell as a result of compromised membrane protein channels and insufficient carrier solvent (water) • Local tissue resistance to endocrine hormones caused by faulty integrity and responsiveness of membrane receptors • Chronic fatigue resulting from lack of enzyme-catalyzed energy production31 • Free radical damage to cell structures, including DNA, as a result of reduced enzymatic free radical scavenging • Inadequate repair of nuclear DNA damage resulting from faulty enzyme repair activity • Reduced production of key bioactive compounds, such as hor- mones, digestive enzymes, neurotransmitters, etc. • Accumulation of toxins within cells • Increased synthesis of histamine within the central nervous sys- tem32 • Chronically elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) • Chronically elevated levels of cortisol, with adverse effects on bone integrity, muscle mass, connective tissue, blood pressure, and immunity2 • Development of chronic kidney disease, exacerbated by increased vasopressin release, cortical aldose reductase activation (which leads to uric acid production and oxidative stress), and hyperurice- mia33

## Subclinical Dehydration (Hypohydration): The Missing

<!-- chunk -->

## Diagnosis

Water cures nothing except dehydration. However, once dehydra- tion has been corrected at the cellular level, healing is possible. This is because hypohydration at the cellular level is a major contributing factor to many ailments. Based on years of research with inmates of an Iranian prison, Dr. Fereydoon Batmanghelidj has proposed a new paradigm of disease and healing. It states that the suffering associated with many disorders is triggered or worsened by dehydration. The reason for this effect is that, under the stress of dehydra- tion, the body takes desperate measures to conserve water. Part of this effort involves the synthesis and release of histamine. It appears that histamine release activates other systems designed to save body water. Antidiuretic hormone decreases water loss in urine. Histamine and kinin compounds influence the escape of water from capillar- ies into connective tissue. Decreasing blood water content decreases blood volume and increases plasma sodium concentration, activat- ing the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin to elevate blood pressure.4,5,34 A key concept of Dr. Batmanghelidj’s new paradigm is based on his years of clinical observation and practice with only the simplest crude healing tools at his disposal. He writes, “Chronic cellular dehydration painfully and prematurely kills. Its initial outward manifestations have until now been labeled as diseases of unknown origin.” Recurrent noninfectious conditions associated with pain and dis- comfort in various parts of the body, which cannot be explained by other identifiable causes, can be interpreted as expressions of water deficits at the sites of the tissue manifesting symptoms.4,35

# COMMON CONDITIONS IMPROVED BY WATER

On the basis of empirical experience, the scope of application of water as a therapeutic tool is immense. The only caveat is that kidney filtra- tion must be intact and healthy to allow the excretion of water and accompanying toxins. Additionally, given the vast number of pollut- ants found in most water sources, an effort to provide pure water must be made.36,37 The following is a list of disorders in which water therapy is indicated: • Coronary heart disease • Peptic ulcers • Arthritis • Hypertension • Low back pain • Intermittent claudication • Fibromyalgia • Migraine headache • Hangover headache • Constipation • Colitis • Obesity • Edema of unknown origin • Chronic fatigue syndrome A few of these are considered in more detail later.

## Coronary Heart Disease and Fatal Myocardial Infarction

It has been known for some time that high blood and plasma viscosity, high hematocrit, and high blood concentrations of fibrinogen are cor- related with coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. Remarkably, even high “normal” levels of these parameters are considered indepen- dent risk factors.21,31,34,35,38–43 These factors have also been linked to intermittent claudication.41 High hematocrit has been associated with tachycardia, the magnitude of heart tissue damage from myocardial infarction, reduced oxygen transport, and reduced blood supply to heart tissue. Based on this evidence, researchers at the Heart Institute of Loma Linda University analyzed lifestyle data to determine what influence the consumption of pure water and other beverages would have on the risk of fatal heart attack. Compared with those who drank two or fewer glasses of pure water daily, men who drank five or more had only 46% of the risk of having a fatal heart attack and women had only 59% of the risk. Even more remarkable, compared with those who drank two or fewer glasses of fluids other than pure water (e.g., tea, soft drink, juice, etc.), women who drank five or more had 147% greater risk and men had 46% greater risk. Moreover, these relative risk relationships held regard- less of adjustments for any other factors. In essence, the consumption of pure water decreases the risk of fatal heart attack; consumption of other beverages increases the risk.32

## 964SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

According to the researchers, failing to drink enough water can be as harmful to heart health as smoking. Just by increasing pure water intake, one can reduce the risk of death from heart attack by one half. This amount of benefit is greater than that gained by ceasing smok- ing, reducing cholesterol, exercising, or maintaining ideal body weight. Thus increasing one’s intake of pure water could be the cheapest and simplest imaginable method of reducing fatal heart attack risk.

## Peptic Ulcers and Dyspepsia

These conditions were the first that brought hidden, subclinical dehy- dration to the attention of Dr. Batmanghelidj in the Iranian prison. Thousands of cases successfully treated with water therapy lend cre- dence to this modality. Chronic inflammation of the stomach and duodenum, with heartburn and acid reflux, are prime indications for water intervention. The concept here is not farfetched when the function of the intestinal organs is understood. The gastrointestinal mucous membranes must produce sufficient mucus to protect them- selves from damage from digestive acid and enzymes. All of these secretions are water-based. Hypohydration inhibits both digestion and membrane protection. In addition, water deficits reduce the volume of bicarbonate-containing fluids released from the pancreas. This deficit results in a failure to properly neutralize stomach acid, leading to duo- denal ulcers.44

## Asthma and Allergies

Histamine is a prime mediator of allergy and asthma. It is generated in the central nervous system when the body is dehydrated. It is also released by mast cells located on the mucous membranes of the respi- ratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Histamine works with the immune system, facilitating the movement of white blood cells to sites of micro- bial invasion. Of particular note is the new scientific light being shed on exer- cise-induced asthma. Studies indicate that dehydration during exercise can increase the intensity of asthma symptoms in persons subject to asthmatic attacks. Dehydration can increase spasms of the bronchial smooth muscle because of overly dry airway membranes. Dehydration of mucous membranes occurs before the asthmatic athlete even begins training. Dehydrated asthmatics begin exercise with reduced hydration capacity; therefore a pathological respiratory state occurs more rap- idly. Researchers have concluded that, “Exercise induced asthma is an exaggerated airway response to airway dehydration.” Airway narrow- ing from exercise in elite athletes and otherwise healthy subjects is now considered a physiological response to pathological changes in airway cells resulting from “dehydration injury.”45 These changes also occur in healthy subjects exercising intensely for long periods and breathing cold air, dry air, or both.46 To minimize the risk of asthmatic attacks during exercise, it is imperative for the athlete to be in a state of optimal hydration before training begins and for good hydration status to be maintained throughout the exercise and during recovery. Pure water can be a very dear friend to an asthmatic.

## Migraine Headache

As with allergies and asthma, histamine is believed to be a contribut- ing factor in migraine headache. (See Chapter 198, Migraine, for more complete discussion.) Hypohydration induces the central nervous system to increase its synthesis of histamine. Thus optimal hydration should minimize histamine synthesis as well as associated migraine headache. Additionally, hydration status may also affect other variables known to trigger migraines. For example, changes in physical exercise and weather may be related to water loss, and a drop in osmolality during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle may have an effect.47 Anecdotal clinical evidence is mounting in support of pure water as a helpful adjunct to other natural approaches.

## Weight Loss

A higher water intake has been associated with more significant weight and body fat loss over time, independently of other variables.48 Additionally, in a randomized controlled trial, water preloading before a meal was also associated with additional weight loss.49 This is likely mediated via a reduced energy intake with the subsequent meal.50

## 966SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


Ginger possesses numerous pharmacological properties; the following are the most relevant: • Antioxidant effects • Inhibition of prostaglandin, thromboxane, and leukotriene synthe- sis • Inhibition of platelet aggregation • Cholesterol-lowering actions • Choleretic effects • Cardiotonic effects • Gastrointestinal actions • Thermogenic properties • Antibiotic activities

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant Effects

Ginger has shown antioxidant effects in experimental studies.5 In a study in rats, ginger significantly lowered lipid peroxidation by main- taining the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. The blood glutathione content was significantly increased in ginger-fed rats. To achieve a similar effect with vitamin C, the dosage required was 100 mg/kg body weight.6 Ginger’s strong antioxidant properties have led to its being investi- gated for preventing the development of rancidity in meat products.7 Ginger has been shown to prolong the shelf life of fresh, frozen, and precooked pork patties. Because the use of many synthetic antioxi- dants is prohibited by law, ginger may one day be used commercially to extend the shelf lives of meats and other foods.

## Effects on Prostaglandin and Leukotriene Metabolism

Numerous constituents in ginger have been shown to be potent inhib- itors of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis through blocking of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.8–13 The most potent components appear to be the pungent principles, although the aqueous extract has also demonstrated inhibition. Inhibition of prostaglandin and leu- kotriene formation could explain some of ginger’s historical use as an anti-inflammatory agent. However, ginger and its extracts also have strong antioxidant activities, and fresh ginger contains a protease with action that may be similar to that of other plant proteases (e.g., brome- lain, ficin, papain) on inflammation.1 Repeated ginger administration to mice augmented corticosteroid secretion, indicating that chronic ingestion may produce an anti-inflammatory effect via this mechanism as well.14

<!-- chunk -->

## Effects on Platelets and Fibrinolysis

Ginger, like garlic and onions, is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation.11 However, ginger’s effects may be far more powerful. In a comparison, an aqueous extract of ginger was shown to exert greater inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation than aqueous garlic and onion extracts.15 Ginger was shown to produce a greater inhibition of thromboxane for- mation and proaggregatory prostaglandins. Ginger, but not onion or garlic, also significantly reduced platelet lipid peroxide formation. In another model, gingerol compounds and their derivatives were more potent antiplatelet agents than aspirin.11 AB Fig. 130.1 (A) Zingiber officinale root. (B) Z. officinale rhizome.

## 967CHAPTER 130 Zingiber officinale (Ginger)

The superiority of ginger over onions was also demonstrated in a controlled study.16 Female volunteers given either 70 g raw onion or 5 g raw ginger demonstrated that ginger has a pronounced effect in lowering platelet thromboxane production, whereas onion actually produced a mild elevation (pooled results). In addition to acting on platelets, ginger promotes fibrinolysis. In one study, administration of 50 g of fat to 30 healthy adult volun- teers decreased fibrinolytic activity from a mean of 64.20 to 52.10 U.17 Supplementation of 5 g of ginger powder with the fatty meal not only prevented the drop in fibrinolytic activity but actually increased the activity significantly.

## Cholesterol-Lowering and Hepatic Effects

Ginger has been shown to significantly reduce serum and hepatic cholesterol levels in cholesterol-fed rats by impairing cholesterol absorption as well as stimulating cholesterol-7-alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis.18–20 In addition, gin- ger has been shown to increase bile secretion.21 Therefore ginger works to lower cholesterol by promoting excretion and impairing absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiotonic and Hypotensive Properties

Gingerol has shown potent cardiotonic activity (positive inotropic and chronotropic effects) on isolated guinea pig left atria.22,23 These effects are a result of the acceleration of calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Gingerol was the first substance shown to produce these effects. Individuals with heart problems or high blood pressure may bene- fit more from using fresh ginger rather than a dried preparation. This recommendation is based not only on the fact that gingerol is the more potent cardiotonic but also because animal studies demonstrate that shogaol has a blood pressure–elevating effect.24 Gingerol is found pre- dominantly in fresh ginger, whereas shogaol is rarely found in dried ginger.

<!-- chunk -->

## Analgesic Effects

Ginger has demonstrated analgesic effects in experimental studies in animals.25 This effect is thought to be a result of inhibition by shogaol of the release of substance P, much like that by capsaicin, the pungent principle of red pepper (Capsicum frutescens).

<!-- chunk -->

## Gastrointestinal Smooth Muscle Effects

Another aspect of ginger is its ability to simultaneously improve gas- tric motility and exert antispasmodic effects. This action is consis- tent with its use as a gastrointestinal tonic. A lipophilic ginger extract was shown in one study to enhance gastric motility, as evidenced by increased intestinal transport of a charcoal meal fed to rats,26 and var- ious fat-soluble components of ginger, such as galanolactone, demon- strated antagonism of serotonin receptor sites.27 This latter mechanism may be responsible for ginger’s antispasmodic effects on visceral and vascular smooth muscle. In a human study, 1000 mg of dried ginger did not affect lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure at rest or esophageal contractile amplitude and duration when swallowing but caused more relaxation of the LES (after 90, 150, and 180 minutes, when swallowing) and decreased the esophageal contraction velocity, which may produce the expulsion of gastric gas or have an antiflatulent effect.28 Ginger has also been shown to inhibit serotonin-induced diarrhea and exert anti- emetic effects in experimental models.29,30 Via inhibition of prostaglandin production, ginger also prevents the slow-wave dysrhythmias produced by acute gastrointestinal hyperglycemia.31 Ginger accelerates gastric emptying and stimulates antral contrac- tions in healthy volunteers.32 Oral ginger extract was also shown to improve gastroduodenal motility in the fasting state and after a stan- dard test meal in healthy human volunteers.33

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiulcer Effects

Ginger has demonstrated significant antiulcer effects in a variety of animal models.34–36 Ginger prevents ulcer formation from ethanol, indomethacin, aspirin, and other common ulcerogenic compounds. The pungent principles appear to be responsible for this effect. In one study, roasted ginger inhibited ulcer formation in three gastric ulcer models, but dry ginger had no such effect.37 A methanol extract of the dried powdered ginger rhizome, fractions of the extract, and the isolated constituents gingerol and shogaol were tested against 19 strains of Helicobacter pylori—a bacterium associated with peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. The methanol extract of ginger rhizome inhibited the growth of all 19 strains in vitro, with a minimum inhibitory concentration range of 6.25 to 50 mg/mL. One fraction of the crude extract, containing the gingerols, was active and inhibited the growth of all strains with a minimum inhibitory concentration range of 0.78 to 12.5 μ g/mL.38

## Thermogenic Properties

Ginger is noted for its ability to subjectively warm the body and has historically been used as a diaphoretic. In animal studies, ginger has been shown to help maintain body temperature and to inhibit sero- tonin-induced hypothermia.29,39 Crude extracts and the pungent components of ginger have been shown to increase oxygen consumption, perfusion pressure, and lac- tate production in the perfused rat hind limb.40 These effects signify increased thermogenesis. Gingerol is the most potent thermogenic component of ginger. A human study demonstrated that consuming a ginger sauce (containing unspecified amounts of ginger principles) with a meal had no significant effect on metabolic rate.41 However, there were two problems with this study: (1) the concentration of gin- gerol in the preparation used was probably low or zero, and (2) the effective concentration range of gingerol for its thermogenic effects is quite narrow. Given ginger’s historical use as a “warming” substance, these scien- tific investigations appear to support its use as a diaphoretic and ther- mogenic aid, although confirmation in humans is still lacking.

## Antibiotic Activity

Ginger, shogaol, and zingerone have been shown to be strongly inhib- itory against Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, and Trichophyton viola- ceum, whereas aqueous extracts at 2.5%, 5%, and 25% concentrations have been shown to be effective against Trichomonas vaginalis.42 Ginger and its pungent principles were also demonstrated to possess significant antifungal activity against pathogenic yeast.43

## Anticancer Effects

Ginger extracts and some pungent constituents present in ginger have exhibited antitumor activity in experimental models of carcinogene- sis.44 In 2018 a comprehensive review examined the literature pertain- ing to the use of ginger extract and [6]-gingerol against tumorigenic and oxidative and inflammatory processes associated with cancer, along with the underlying mechanisms of action involved in signaling path- ways.45 Data collected from in vitro or in vivo experiments and clinical studies indicate that ginger extract and [6]-gingerol exert their action through important mediators and pathways of cell signaling, includ- ing Bax/Bcl2, p38/MAPK, Nrf2, p65/nuclear factor (NF)- κ B, tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF)- α , ERK ½, SAPK/JNK, ROS/NF- κ B/ COX-2,

caspase-3 and caspase-9, and p53. This suggests that ginger derivatives (extract or isolated compounds) exhibit relevant antiproliferative, antitumor, invasive, and anti-inflammatory activities.

## Effects on Insulin and Blood Glucose

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic syn- drome (MetS) share common characteristics of raised blood sugar, decreased insulin sensitivity, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which often appear simultaneously rather than alone. Ginger has been documented to ameliorate hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation and may therefore be a promising therapy for T2DM and MetS mediated by transcription factors, such as peroxi- some proliferator-activated receptors, adenosine monophosphate-ac- tivated protein kinase, and NF- κ B.46 Additional proposed mechanisms of ginger include the inhibition of hepatic phosphorylase preventing glycogenolysis in hepatic cells, inhibition of hepatic glucose-6-phos- phatase activity, and increasing glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) to promote glucose uptake in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells. A thorough review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials revealed that ginger significantly reduces fasting blood glucose and HbA 1c , significantly improves fasting insulin and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and ameliorates most of the MetS risk factors.47 As an example, one randomized, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 88 patients with T2DM investi- gated the effect of ginger supplementation on insulin resistance and glycemic indices.48 The cohort was randomly assigned to ginger or pla- cebo groups. The ginger group consumed three 1-g capsules contain- ing ginger powder daily, whereas the placebo group received capsules of the same color and number but containing cellulose microcrystal- line. After 8 weeks, fasting blood sugar mean showed a decrease of 10.5% in the ginger group, whereas the mean had an increase of 21% in the placebo group. Variations in HbA 1c mean correlated with that of fasting blood sugar. A statistical difference was also found before and after the intervention in the median of fasting insulin level, insulin sensitivity, and HOMA-IR. Two additional randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled tri- als evaluated the effects of ginger on glycemic indices in patients with T2DM. The first study involved 64 patients with T2DM randomly assigned to either ginger (2 g/day) or placebo (2 g/day) groups.49 After 2 months of intervention, ginger supplementation significantly low- ered the levels of insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and the HOMA-IR. However, no significant changes were observed in fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and HbA 1c . In the second study, 20- to 60-year-old patients with T2DM who did not receive insulin were given 3 g of pow- dered ginger (intervention group) or 3 g of lactose (placebo group) daily for 3 months.50 In addition to glycemic indices, the researchers also examined the effects of ginger on total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum para- oxonase (PON-1). At the end of the study, compared with placebo, the intervention (ginger) group had statistically significant reductions in serum glucose, HbA 1c percentage, insulin, insulin resistance, high-sen- sitive CRP, and MDA as well as statistically increased TAC and PON-1 activity. Although promising, further high-quality studies with larger sample sizes and longer duration of treatment are needed to examine these findings and evaluate discrepancies.


Ginger is widely used as a condiment for its unique flavors, but from the previously described pharmacology, it obviously has important medicinal effects as well. In general, like many other culinary herbs and spices, such as garlic and onions, ginger provides many health-promot- ing effects. Specifically, ginger provides benefit to many body systems, including the digestive, hepatobiliary, and cardiovascular systems. Historically, the majority of complaints for which ginger was used concerned the gastrointestinal system. A clue to ginger’s efficacy in alleviating gastrointestinal distress is offered in several double-blind studies on motion sickness, hyperemesis gravidum, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Human studies have also shown a positive effect in arthritis and migraine headaches.

## Motion Sickness

Ginger was first shown to be effective in treating motion sickness by Mowrey and Clayson in 1982.51 In their study, ginger (940 mg) was shown to be far superior to dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) 100 mg in relieving symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Since this initial study, several better-designed follow-up studies have evaluated the effective- ness of ginger as a motion sickness medication. The appearance of motion sickness trials using ginger prompted an interest in ginger by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which subsequently funded a study at Louisiana State University. This study compared ginger, both fresh and dried pow- dered, with scopolamine by measuring the number of head move- ments experimental subjects could make in a rotating chair until they reached an end point defined as motion sickness short of vomiting. Ginger was not shown to produce any protection against motion sick- ness in this model or in two additional protocols (vestibular stimula- tion only and combined vestibular-visual stimulation).52 However, in a double-blind trial, perhaps a more “real-life” test, ginger (1 g) given to naval cadets unaccustomed to sailing in heavy seas was shown to reduce the tendency toward vomiting and cold sweating in comparison with a placebo.53 Mowrey and Clayson51 proposed that the anti–motion sickness effects of ginger were due to local gastrointestinal tract effects rather than to central nervous system effects. Although ginger’s mechanism of action in alleviating gastrointestinal distress has yet to be fully elu- cidated, there is evidence to support this hypothesis. Ginger has been shown to partially inhibit the excessive gastric motility characteristic of motion sickness.52 To further support a gastric versus a central nervous system mechanism of action, one study clearly demonstrated that nei- ther the vestibular system nor the oculomotor system, both of which are critical in the occurrence of motion sickness, was influenced by ginger (1 g).54 However, in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-con- trolled study, ginger (1 g) was shown to significantly reduce induced vertigo but not nystagmus.55 It has been hypothesized by others that ginger ameliorates the nau- sea associated with motion sickness by preventing the development of gastric dysrhythmias and the elevation of plasma vasopressin. To test this hypothesis, 13 volunteers with a history of motion sickness under- went circular vection, during which nausea (scored 0–3, i.e., none to severe), electrogastrographic recordings, and plasma vasopressin lev- els were assessed with or without ginger pretreatment in a crossover, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.56 Circular vec- tion induced a maximal nausea score of 2.5 and increased tachygastric activity and plasma vasopressin. Pretreatment with ginger (1000 and 2000 mg) effectively reduced nausea, tachygastric activity, and vaso- pressin release induced by circular vection. The overall effectiveness of ginger in motion sickness has yet to be definitively determined. Issues that the studies have raised include the variability in the quality of commercial ginger preparations and the time required for ginger to produce its effects. Commercial prepara- tions vary widely in chemical composition and often contain adul- terants, and in the ginger study conducted at sea, ginger reduced

symptoms of cold sweating and vomiting only at the end of 4 hours. In other words, it appears that ginger may prove to be more effec- tive when well-defined preparations are given at least 4 hours before motion is experienced.

## Nausea and Vomiting

The mechanisms of action underlying ginger’s efficiency in reduc- ing nausea and vomiting have been investigated, and dual antiemetic actions have been highlighted: (1) gingerols and shogaols act as antag- onists of cholinergic M3 and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors of the cen- tral nervous system; and (2) ginger’s constituents improve the gastric tonus, motility, and emptying due to peripheral anticholinergic and antiserotonergic actions.57 Ginger’s antiemetic action has been studied in hyperemesis gravidum, the most severe form of pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. This condition usually requires hospitalization. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial, ginger root powder at a dose of 250 mg four times a day brought about a significant reduction in both the severity of the nausea and the number of attacks of vomit- ing in 19 of 27 patients in the early stages of pregnancy (<20 weeks).58 Another natural approach to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is vitamin B 6 . In one double-blind study, 138 women were given either 500 mg of ginger or 10 mg of vitamin B 6 three times daily for 3 days.59 Subjects graded the severity of their nausea using visual analog scales before treatment and recorded the number of vomiting episodes in the previous 24 hours and again during 3 consecutive days of treatment. The ginger and vitamin B 6 significantly reduced the nausea scores from 5 to 3.6 and 5.3 to 3.3, respectively, and the number of vomiting epi- sodes from 1.9 to 1.2 and 1.7 to 1.2, respectively. There was no signif- icant difference between ginger and vitamin B 6 for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. However, in another study, ginger was shown to be more effective.60 In that study, 70 women were randomized to receive either ginger 1 g/day or vitamin B 6 mg/day for 4 days. Subjects graded the severity of their nausea using a visual analog scale and recorded the number of vomiting episodes in the 24 hours before treatment and during 4 consecutive days while taking treatment. Compared with baseline, the decrease in scores of posttherapy nausea in the ginger group was significantly greater than that for the vitamin B 6 group. In the ginger group, 29 of 35 women reported an improvement in nausea symptoms compared with 23 of 34 women in the vitamin B 6 group. These results indicate that ginger is more effective than vitamin B 6 for relieving the severity of nausea and is equally effective for decreasing the number of vomiting episodes in early pregnancy. In a placebo-controlled study, 70 women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomly assigned to receive either oral ginger 1 g/ day or an identical placebo for 4 days.61 Subjects graded the severity of their nausea using visual analog scales and recorded the number of vomiting episodes in the 24 hours before treatment and again during consecutive days during treatment. At a follow-up visit 7 days later, the number of vomiting episodes had decreased significantly in the ginger group; 28 of 32 in the ginger group had an improvement in nausea symptoms, compared with 10 of 35 in the placebo group. In a double-blind study comparing ginger with dimenhydrinate, pregnant women with the symptoms of nausea and vomiting in preg- nancy were randomly allocated to take one capsule of ginger twice daily (one capsule contained 0.5 g of ginger powder), whereas the patients in group B received an identical capsule of 50 mg dimenhydrinate twice daily.62 The results showed that ginger is as effective as dimenhydrinate in the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy and has fewer side effects. Specifically, there was a statistically significant difference in the side effect of drowsiness after treatment in diphenhydramine group compared with the ginger group (78% vs. 6%, respectively). These clinical results and those reported by others,63–67 along with the safety and the relatively small dose of ginger required and the prob- lems (e.g., teratogenicity) with antiemetic drugs in pregnancy, support the use of ginger for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This recom- mendation is becoming a well-accepted prescription even in orthodox obstetrical practices. Ginger appears to be very safe for use during pregnancy. A sys- tematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of ginger for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy did not identify any major toxicities from in vivo studies, and after observations of clinical studies, the use of ginger showed a significant decrease in nausea and vomiting and no risk for the mother or her future baby.68 The antiemetic action of ginger has also been observed in women who had undergone major gynecological surgery. In four double-blind studies, 1000 to 1500 mg of dried powdered ginger root per day was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of nausea compared with placebo in a manner similar to the drug metoclopramide.69–72 Ginger also has shown good results in alleviating chemotherapy-in- duced nausea and vomiting. In one study, 60 chemotherapy cycles of cisplatin/doxorubicin in patients with bone sarcoma were randomized to ginger root powder capsules or placebo capsules as an additional antiemetic to ondansetron and dexamethasone in a double-blind design.73 Acute moderate to severe nausea was observed in 28 of (93.3%) cycles in the control group compared with 15 of 27 (55.6%) cycles in the ginger group. In a study in women receiving cisplatin for gynecological cancers, the addition of ginger to a standard antiemetic regimen had no advantage in reducing nausea or vomiting in the acute phase of cisplatin-induced emesis.74 However, after the initial 24 hours after cisplatin, ginger was shown to be equal to metoclopramide. In still another study, ginger provided no additional benefit in reducing the prevalence or severity of acute or delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting when given with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and/or aprepitant (Emend).75

## Inflammatory Conditions

Ginger’s ability to inhibit the formation of inflammatory prosta- glandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes and its strong antioxidant activities and protease component suggest a possible benefit in inflam- matory conditions. To test this hypothesis, a preliminary clinical study was conducted in seven patients with rheumatoid arthritis, in whom conventional drugs had provided only temporary or partial relief.76 One patient took 50 g/day of lightly cooked ginger, and the other six took either 5 g of fresh or 0.1 to 1 g of powdered ginger daily. All patients reported substantial improvement, including relief of pain, greater joint mobility, and decreased swelling and morning stiffness. In the follow-up to this study, 28 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 18 with osteoarthritis, and 10 with muscular discomfort who had been taking powdered ginger for periods ranging from 3 months to 2.5 years were evaluated. On the basis of their clinical observations, Srivastava and Mustafa77 reported that 75% of the patients with arthritis and 100% of the patients with muscular discomfort experienced relief in pain or swelling. The recommended dosage was 500 to 1000 mg/day, but many patients took three to four times this amount. Patients taking the higher dosages also reported quicker and better relief. Three double-blind studies with standardized and highly concen- trated extracts of ginger provide additional support for the usefulness of ginger in osteoarthritis, although in one study ginger was effective only after 3 months of use.78–80 In the largest of the three studies, 261 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were given either ginger extract or placebo twice daily, with acetaminophen allowed as rescue medication.79 The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of responders experiencing a reduction in “knee pain on standing,” with the use of an intent-to-treat

analysis. The percentage of responders experiencing a reduction in knee pain on standing was superior in the ginger extract group to that in the control group (63% vs. 50%). Analysis of the secondary efficacy variables revealed a consistently greater response in the ginger extract group com- pared with the control group in the following mean values: reduction in knee pain on standing (24.5 vs. 16.4 mm), reduction in knee pain after walking 50 ft (15.1 vs. 8.7 mm), and reduction in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities’ Osteoarthritis Composite Index (12.9 vs. mm). Change in global status and reduction in intake of rescue medica- tion were also numerically greater in the ginger extract group. The effect of ginger on proinflammatory cytokines in patients with osteoarthritis was examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, 3-month clinical trial.81 120 participants were assigned to one of two groups: the ginger group (500 mg ginger powder) or the placebo group (500 mg starch). Although proinflammatory cytokine levels did not differ by group at baseline, at the end of the trial, serum levels of tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β ) decreased in the ginger group relative to placebo. One evaluation looking at ginger’s ability to reduce muscle pain consisted of two identical double-blind, placebo-controlled random- ized studies with participants consuming either 2 g of raw (study 1) or heated (study 2) ginger or placebo for 11 consecutive days.82 Participants performed 18 eccentric actions of the elbow flexors to induce pain and inflammation. Pain intensity, perceived effort, plasma prostaglandin E(2), arm volume, range of motion, and isometric strength were assessed before and for 3 days after exercise. Raw and heat-treated ginger resulted in similar pain reductions 24 hours after eccentric exercise compared with placebo (25% and 23% reduction, respectively). In another study, a single 2-g dose of ginger did not attenuate eccentric exercise-induced muscle pain, inflammation, or dysfunction 45 minutes after ingestion, indicating that ginger’s effects are likely more cumulative in reducing the day-to-day progression of muscle pain.83 It has also been reported that ginger is beneficial in migraine head- ache.84 A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial evaluated the potential of ginger to improve acute migraine as an add-on strategy to standard treatment.85 Sixty participants were randomized into two groups in which they received 400 mg of ginger extract (5% active ingredient) or placebo (cellulose), in addition to an intravenous drug (100 mg of ketoprofen) to treat the migraine attack. Patients treated with ginger showed a significantly better clinical response after hour, 1.5 hours, and 2 hours. Furthermore, ginger treatment promoted a reduction in pain and improvement in functional status at all times assessed. Given ginger’s effects on platelets, eicosanoids, and serotonin inhibition, this recommendation makes sense.


Many questions remain concerning the best form of ginger and the proper dosage. Most research studies have used 1 g of dried powdered ginger root. Practically speaking, this is a small dose. For example, ginger is commonly consumed in India at a daily dose of 8 to 10 g. Furthermore, although most studies have used powdered ginger root, fresh (or possibly freeze-dried) ginger root or extracts (concentrated for gingerol) at an equivalent dosage may yield even better results because they may deliver higher levels of gingerol as well as the active protease. In the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness or pregnancy or after surgery, a dosage of 1 to 2 g of dried powdered ginger may be effective. This would be equivalent to approximately 10 g or 1/3 oz of fresh ginger root, roughly a ¼-in. slice. For inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage should be double this amount. For ginger extracts standardized to contain 20% gingerol and shogaol, an equivalent dosage in treating motion sickness or nausea and vomiting would be 100 to 200 mg. For other applications, the dos- age is 100 to 200 mg three times daily.


Ginger does not appear to produce any toxicity problems when used at normal dosages. Although ginger extracts and several components in ginger have been shown to possess potent mutagenic activity, gin- ger also contains several equally potent antimutagenic substances.86,87 The significance of this mutagenicity (the study was conducted in Escherichia coli and did not use the Ames test) has not been entirely determined, but the long history of ginger’s use and the lack of carcino- genic or toxic effect in animals suggest that toxicity is not a problem. In acute toxicity tests in mice, ginger extract administered as a lavage was tolerated up to 2.5 g/kg with no mortality or side effects during a 7-day trial period.88 Increasing the dosage to 3 to 3.5 g/kg resulted in a 10% to 30% mortality rate. In comparison, 0.6 g/kg of aspirin produced mortality in 25%, stomach ulcers in 40%, and hypo- thermia in 60% of subjects. Some individuals consuming high doses—more than the equiv- alent of 6 g of dried powdered ginger—alone on an empty stomach may experience some gastrointestinal discomfort. Administration of 6 g of dried powdered ginger has been shown to increase the exfolia- tion of gastric surface epithelial cells in human subjects.89 This effect may cause some gastric distress and ultimately could lead to ulcer for- mation. Therefore it is recommended that dosages consumed on an empty stomach be less than 6 g.


Ginger may potentiate antiplatelet therapy.90 However, ginger admin- istration had no such effect in 12 healthy male subjects who received coumadin alone or with ginger. No changes in platelet aggregation, the international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, warfarin enantio- mer protein binding, warfarin enantiomer concentrations in plasma, or S-7-hydroxywarfarin concentration in urine were seen.91

# Syndromes and Special Topics

# 1

Careful study of the various diseases to which humans are heir indicates that a limited number of underlying problems either cause or significantly contribute to most diseases. The reductionist philosophy underlying most of conventional medical research and practice results in more accurate diagnosis and more specific therapies for a given disease but makes recognition of broad patterns of disease causation progressively more difficult. We believe the reader will find the syndromes discussed in this section interesting, relevant, and a compelling induce- ment for the development of a more holistic approach to patients. Old-fashioned ideas such as “bowel toxemia” and “liver toxicity” not only are intuitively reasonable but now have solid scientific evidence to support their validity. As one reads the chapters in this section, a compelling concept of medicine emerges: Poor diet + unhealthy lifestyle + toxin exposure ↓ Nutritional deficiencies + toxicity ↓ (In the context of genetic susceptibility) Metabolic dysfunction + subacute disease ↓ Clinically recognizable diseases that are apparently unrelated to the underlying causes 1 Users of a previous edition of the TBNM will notice that this section moved from IV to V. This was done to improve the flow of the sections and to more logically combine Sections V and VI into the second volume.

# Lifestyle Factors in Cancer

Lise Alschuler, ND months of their diagnosis, consume significant fiber (average consump- tion of 15.5 g/day of insoluble dietary fiber) experience a 49% reduction in the likelihood of having elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentra- tions (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27, 0.95) compared with those who consumed an average of 5.4 g/day (P = 0.053). This suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of fiber consumption, which in turn improves treatment toleration and is associated with improved survival.9 A dietary pattern characterized by a significant reduction in the consumption of saturated fat, increased consumption of vegetable pro- teins, and reductions in animal proteins and dairy products has been shown to significantly increase the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men with prostate cancer.10 The slowed PSA doubling time reflects decreased prostate cancer progression. Colon cancer development and progression are also influenced by diet. Frequent consumption of red meat, refined carbohydrates, dairy, and eggs is associated with an increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer compared with infrequent consumption.11 There is also a significant inverse relationship between total fiber intake and the risk of colorectal cancer (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47–0.68). Vegetable fiber appears to be more protective than either fruit or grain fiber.12 In patients with diagnosed colon cancer, a dietary pattern that empha- sizes plant foods and minimizes animal sources of protein would be expected to exert a beneficial effect on the colon, perhaps influencing progression risk.

## Obesity

It is now estimated that 2.4% to 3.9% of cancer deaths can be attributed to obesity.13 In an analysis of 70 clinical trials comprising 80,000 patients with early-stage breast cancer, the relative risk of dying from breast cancer was increased by 34% in obese (body mass index [BMI] > 30) premenopausal women (younger than age 55 y) with ER+ tumors.14 In other words, the absolute 10-year breast cancer mortal- ity for premenopausal women with ER+ disease was 21.5% for obese women compared with 16.6% for nonobese women. Postmenopausal obese women with ER+ disease had a 6% increased risk of dying from breast cancer. There was no association between obesity and breast cancer death in women with estrogen receptor–negative (ER–) tumors. Genetic analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsies has identified genes with statistically significant changes in expression between obese and nonobese women.15 In addition, obesity is characterized by hyper- insulinemia, estrogen signaling, and inflammation—all of which play important roles in obesity-accelerated breast cancer aggressiveness. Obesity is also associated with unfavorable outcomes for patients with prostate cancer. A higher BMI (consistent with being overweight and obese) is predictive of a greater likelihood of rising PSA after sur- gery, indicating prostate cancer recurrence.16 Furthermore, overweight and obese men experience shorter times to biochemical recurrence after surgery than normal-weight men. Obesity is a known risk factor for the development of colorec- tal cancer, as well as its progression. Obesity-related dyslipidemias, increased adipokines, and elevated insulin and insulin-like growth fac- tor-1 (IGF-1) are collectively associated with both increased colorectal cancer incidence and increased mortality in both men and women (see Fig. 131.1).17 Obesity also negatively affects the effectiveness of con- ventional treatment with a mainstay of colorectal cancer treatment, bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is the main targeted therapy for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis by blocking the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF-receptor pathway. Obesity is associated with increased levels of VEGF, which could lead to resistance to anti-VEGF bevaci- zumab therapy. In fact, a prospective clinical trial demonstrated that in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were treated with beva- cizumab, those who were overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) experienced a significantly shorter time to progression (p = 0.01; HR: 4.37).18

## Insulin Resistance

An important driver of malignant behavior in many cancer cell types is the significant expression of insulin and IGF-1 receptors.19 As noted pre- viously, insulin and IGF-1 are direct growth factors in these cancer cells.20 Insulin and IGF-1 stimulate cellular proliferation in malignant cells via the constitutively “turned on” insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptors Fig. 131.1 Coincident promotion of insulin resistance and cell proliferation and survival in inflamma- tion.28 Activated cells of the immune system release cytokines and ROS, which induce insulin resistance via JNK and cell proliferation and survival via NF-κB. Positive influences are shown by lines ending in arrows and inhibitory influences by lines ending in bars. (Source: Godsland Ian F.

(IGF-1R), culminating in mTOR activation. Activated mTOR drives pro- liferation, alters mitochondrial metabolism toward anabolism (aerobic glycolysis), and decreases apoptosis.21 Interestingly, some cancers rely exclusively on insulin and IGF-1 for their growth, including an estimated 27% of breast cancers. Approximately 8% of these cases have upregulation of the PIK3/Akt pathway.22 Additionally, IGF-IR is autophosphorylated in breast cancer cells with a predilection for metastasis to the brain. In vivo models demonstrate that experimental deactivation of IGF-IR attenuates the invasive and metastatic potential of these breast cancer cells, thereby delaying the development of brain metastases and prolonging survival. These preclinical findings are corroborated by the fact that 25% to 40% of patients with Her2+ and those with triple-negative breast cancer have a significantly increased risk of brain metastasis. This clinical finding cor- relates with increased IGF-IR signaling in these breast cancer subtypes.23 This concept has clinical application in the dietary advice given to patients. A trial followed 87 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line liposomal doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for a median of 15 months.24 Of the subjects, 87% had hormone receptor–positive disease, and 48% were insulin resistant, with insulin resistance defined as a Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) score of greater than 2.5. (Of note, the HOMA-IR score can be calculated as serum glucose [mg/dL] × plasma insulin [uU/mL]/405, with a value greater than 2.5 indicative of insulin resistance.) Even after adjusting for other prognostic factors, such as patient age, the endocrine status of the tumor, visceral disease, and BMI, patients with advanced breast cancer and insulin resistance had a statistically significant higher risk of disease progression (P = .035). The median progression-free survival was 8 months in women with insulin resistance, compared with 14 months for those who did not have insulin resistance (P = .04). A prospective, observational study of 1011 patients with stage III colon cancer reported their dietary intake during and for months after conventional treatment.25 The median follow-up from the time of completion of adjuvant therapy was 7.3 years. A higher dietary glycemic load was associated with statistically sig- nificant worse disease-free, recurrence-free, and overall survival. Specifically, patients with stage III colon cancer who were in the highest quintile of dietary glycemic load experienced an adjusted HR for disease recurrence of 1.79 (95% CI = 1.29–2.48) compared with those in the lowest quintile (HR = 1) (P trend across quin- tiles < .001). Increased glycemic load was associated with decreased overall survival (P trend across quintiles < .001). These associations were strongest for overweight patients (BMI > 25; HR 2.26). These data points support the use of a low-glycemic, nutrient-dense diet in people diagnosed with cancer.

## Anti-Inflammatory Nutrients

Plant foods and spices concentrate polyphenols, which possess uniquely potent anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of polyphenols are illustrated, for instance, in a parallel-designed, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 120 men and women aged 40 to 74 years that compared the effect of 300 mg of an anthocyanin-rich drink isolated from bilberries and black currants to placebo over a 3-week period.26 Consumption of the proanthocyanin-containing beverage was found to decrease nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B)–controlled proinflamma- tory chemokines and interferon (IFN)-alpha (an inducer of NF- κ B activation) by 45% and 40%, respectively, versus 20% and 15% in the placebo group (P < 0.050). Another trial assessed the effect of 30 grams of freeze-dried vegetable soup added to the daily diet of five patients with stage I non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a toxicity study group and 6 patients with stage III and IV NSCLC in a treatment group for up to 24 months.27 These patients were matched to 13 patients with stage III and IV NSCLC in the control group. The vegetable soup was a freeze-dried medicinal vegetable soup that included soybean, shiitake mushroom, mung bean, red date, scallion, garlic, lentil bean, leek, hawthorn fruit, onion, ginseng, angelica root, licorice, dandelion root, senegal root, ginger, olive, sesame seed, and parsley. All patients were treated with conventional therapies, including radiation, surgery, and/or chemotherapy. Those patients eating the vegetable soup had a median survival time of 15.5 months compared with a median sur- vival time of 4.5 months in the control group (P < 0.01). There was no adverse toxicity in the vegetable group.28 In a controlled trial, 87 patients, 36 with resected colon cancer and 51 patients after polypectomy, were divided into two groups.29 One group of 31 patients was treated daily with a flavonoid mixture of mg apigenin and 20 mg epigallocatechin-gallate and compared with a matched control group of 56 patients. Both groups were observed for 3 to 4 years by surveillance colonoscopy and by questionnaire. Among the 14 patients with resected colon cancer and treated with the flavo- noid mixture, there was no cancer recurrence, and only one adenoma developed. The cancer recurrence rate of the 15 matched untreated controls was 20% (3 of 15), and adenomas evolved in 4 of those patients (27%). The combined recurrence rate for neoplasia was 7% (1 of 14) in the treated patients and 47% (7 of 15) in the controls (P = 0.027). In a trial of 26 men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer, the subjects were randomized to either 30 mg lycopene or no supple- ment before radical prostatectomy.30 In the lycopene group, at sur- gery, 84% had tumors less than 4 mL, versus 45% in the control group. Additionally, 73% of the lycopene group and only 18% of the control group had clean margins. Prostate intraepithelial neoplasia was pres- ent in 67% of the lycopene group compared with 100% of the control group. Finally, PSA decreased by 18% in the lycopene group versus an increase of 14% in the control group. A pooled analysis of three large prospective trials—the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS), the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) Study, and the Women’s Healthy Eating & Living (WHEL) Study—collectively representing 9514 breast cancer survivors with a mean follow-up of 7.4 years, assessed the effect of soy isoflavone.31 Consumption of more than 10 mg isoflavones per day was associated with a 25% reduced risk of recurrence. This inverse associa- tion was seen in tamoxifen users, ER– women, and ER+ women. The polyphenols found in plant foods both down-regulate inflam- matory NF- κ B and upregulate the transcription factor Nrf2. Nrf2 is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with its cytosolic repressor Keap-1. Phytochemicals, specifically polyphenolic flavonoids, activate diverse upstream kinases, which in turn stimulate dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap-1. Once released from Keap-1 repres- sion, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, forms a heterodimer with small Maf protein, and binds to ARE/EpRE sequences located in the promoter region of genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes.32 This effect is synergistic with chemotherapy insofar as intracellular antiox- idants are required to preserve the apoptotic (cell death) cascade ini- tiated by chemotherapy. Additionally, polyphenols directly upregulate apoptosis, the ultimate step in removing aberrant cells. There are many examples of these proapoptotic polyphenols, such as transresveratrol33 from grapes, peanuts, berries, and red wine. Genistein34 from soy and curcumin35 from turmeric activate apoptosis.

## Fasting

A promising approach to improve patient tolerance of chemotherapy is concurrent fasting during chemotherapy. This approach has gained significant momentum from the research of Valter Longo, PhD. The premise of short-term starvation (STS) in an oncology context is two- fold. First, when energy is scarce, cells will use energy preferentially for maintenance functions at the price of growth. Furthermore, IGF-1 levels decrease dramatically in response to short-term (36–120 hours)

## 975CHAPTER 131 Lifestyle Factors in Cancer

of starvation. Cells throughout the body use IGF-1 to signal their growth. Thus fasting results in growth arrest of normal cells. However, most tumor cells have mutations in pTEN, p53, and the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway, leading to constitutive upregulation of insulin and the IGF-1–initiated proliferation pathway.36 Thus, in malignant cells, STS and the resultant decrease in IGF-1 do not downregulate the PI3K/ Akt/mTOR pathway and therefore do not arrest growth in cancer cells. This differential effect can be used concurrently with chemotherapy to preferentially protect healthy cells that will be in a dormant, mainte- nance, and nonproliferative state. This state renders these cells some- what immune to the effects of chemotherapy. At the same time, the malignant cells retain their proliferation during STS and so remain susceptible to chemotherapy. The effects of STS were demonstrated in a case-series report of patients (7 females and 3 males) with cancer (4 with stage IIA breast cancer, 2 with prostate cancer [stage II and stage IV], 1 with stage IA ovarian cancer, 1 with stage IV endometrial cancer, 1 with stage IV NSCLC, and 1 with stage IVB esophageal cancer). 37 All patients received chemotherapy and underwent a water-only fast for 48 to hours pre-chemotherapy and continued for 5 to 56 hours post-chemo- therapy. Patients served as their own controls, and during fasted cycles, they experienced less toxicity even after nonfasted accumulation of toxicity. Patients received an average of our cycles of various chemo- therapy drugs, including docetaxel/cyclophosphamide, docetaxel/ carboplatin/±5-FU, carboplatin/paclitaxel, gemcitabine/docetaxel, docetaxel, and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide. Specifically, the che- motherapy received during the water fast resulted in less fatigue, weak- ness, and gastrointestinal side effects. Although the benefit and safety of this approach, specifically the effect of fasting on treatment response and survival, are still under clinical investigation, it could be considered empirically in patients who experience significant chemotherapy-induced toxic- ity to a level that is threatening their ability to complete treatment. Of note, preclinical research has indicated that fasting may reduce multidrug resistance in malignant cells38; however, this needs to be confirmed in human clinical trials. The exact protocol to opti- mize fasting regimens is under investigation. One fasting protocol being studied includes 24-, 36-, or 48-hour fasts before chemo- therapy.39 Another active clinical trial of women with gynecolog- ical cancers is studying the effect of modified fasting with daily caloric intake of < 400 kcal by juices starting 36 to 48 hours before beginning chemotherapy and lasting to 24 hours after ending each chemotherapy.40 Although not clinically evaluated, a variation of STS can also be considered between chemotherapy treatments and as a follow-up to conventional treatment. In the absence of active treatment, diet can be used to influence the same constitutively overactive IGF-1 and insu- lin-stimulated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in malignant cells. This pro- liferation pathway’s activity is enhanced in the presence of IGF-1 and insulin, both of which are reduced during caloric and carbohydrate restriction. Furthermore, dietary caloric restriction stimulates AMPk, which directly blocks mTOR activation (Fig. 131.2). The result of downregulating mTOR is reduced proliferation. Despite the promis- ing theoretical basis for this approach, the clinical data on the effect of caloric and carbohydrate restriction on overall survival and recurrence risk in humans is yet to be determined.

## Cachexia

Of note, this approach should not be considered for any patient at risk for cachexia, a condition of significant weakness and wasting caused by inflammatory cytokines released by malignant tissue. Certain cancers, such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and many advanced cancers, carry a high risk of cachexia. The consumption of protein and essential fatty acids is a clinically validated way to both prevent and delay cachexia.41 Protein requirements may exceed gm/day in people at risk for cachexia. Typically, at least 0.45 to 0. 9g protein/2 kg body weight is needed to prevent and manage cachexia. Omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at to 3 g daily, is associated with weight gain and improved quality of life. Feeding (increased caloric intake) has not proven to control cachexia.

# EXERCISE

Exercise is a critical component of a lifestyle-based support program during cancer treatment. Data collected over a median of 23 months postdiagnosis (interquartile range 18–32 months) were pooled in the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project (n = 13,302).42 The study found that 2.5 h (10 metabolic-equivalent tasks [MET]-hours/week) of mod- erate-intensity physical activity per week was associated with a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 25% reduction in breast cancer mortality compared with women who did not meet the physical activ- ity guidelines (<10 MET-hours/week). In another study, women who engaged in the equivalent of at least 2 to 3 hours of brisk walking each week in the year before they were diagnosed with breast cancer were 31% less likely to die of the disease than women who were sedentary before their diagnosis (HR = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.45–1.06; P = .045]).43 Women who increased physical activity after diagnosis had a 45% lower risk of death (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.22–1.38) compared with women who were inactive both before and after diagnosis. Conversely, women who decreased physical activity after diagnosis had a fourfold greater risk of death (HR = 3.95; 95% CI, 1.45–10.50). From a cohort of 184,194 adults without colorectal cancer at base- line in 1992 to 1993, 2293 participants were diagnosed with invasive, nonmetastatic colorectal cancer up to mid-2007.44 The mean fol- low-up time from diagnosis to death or the end of the study was 6.8 years. Participants completed detailed questionnaires that included information concerning recreational physical activity and leisure time spent sitting at baseline, before their cancer diagnosis, and again after their cancer diagnosis. The highest prediagnosis recreational phys- ical activity category (8.75 or more MET-hours per week, which is the equivalent of greater than 150 minutes/week) compared with the lowest category (3.5 MET-hours per week) was associated with a 28% lower risk of all-cause mortality.

mortality. Additionally, leisure time spent sitting 6 or more hours per day on the prediagnosis survey was associated with a statistically signif- icant 36% higher risk of all-cause mortality. Postdiagnosis sitting time was associated with a statistically significant 62% higher risk of col- orectal cancer–specific mortality. These studies support recommenda- tions for recreational physical activity and the avoidance of sedentary time among people diagnosed with cancer—throughout the contin- uum of care.

# STRESS MANAGEMENT

A third foundational component of lifestyle-based support of people undergoing cancer treatment is stress management. Elevated and pro- longed stress hormones, namely cortisol, epinephrine, and norepi- nephrine, are associated with the carcinogenic process and shortened survival. The effects of stress on survival was elegantly demonstrated in a prospective trial of 217 participants with newly diagnosed met- astatic renal cell cancer, all with a life expectancy of greater than months, with good performance status and no major concurrent diseases.45 All participants completed depression questionnaires, had salivary cortisol levels assessed, and provided blood samples for genomic analysis at baseline and at 4 months. The following factors were associated with decreased survival time: depression, poor quality of life, and flattened diurnal cortisol slope (with elevation of average cortisol). Genomic analyses identified upregulation of genes involved in inflammation and immune response and downregulation of genes that activate programmed cell death (all p < .0001) as well as genes involved in cell trafficking, adhesion, oxygen transport, and hemo- stasis (all p < .05). Based on rodent models of triple-negative breast cancer, social isolation causes a heightened stress response that, in turn, increases expression of genes in adipocytes that increase glucose metabo- lism, lipid synthesis, and leptin secretion. These metabolic changes increase the conversion of mammary carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. Mammary fat, in particular, has heightened sensitivity to stress hormones over visceral fat, making breast tissue especially vulnerable to stress.46 Although the clinical evidence for the negative effects of stress is still developing, early evidence indicates the benefit of stress management on prognosis in people being treated for cancer. Furthermore, a more robust body of data demonstrates the improve- ment in quality of life that people diagnosed with cancer experience after active stress management.47–49 Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a particularly well-researched stress management behavior. A meta-analysis of studies showed a significant improvement in psychological and phys- ical quality of life with the practice of MBSR.50 MBSR has been shown to reduce depression and fear of recurrence in women diagnosed with breast cancer.51 MBSR lowers cortisol, reduces interleukin-6 (IL-6), lowers systolic blood pressure, and improves natural killer (NK) cell activity—each of which is correlated with a higher quality of life and a better prognosis.52


There is ample evidence to support the inclusion of a lifestyle-based approach in people diagnosed with cancer. A plant-based, Mediterranean-style diet is the foundation of such an approach. Intermittent or continuous caloric restriction may have unique benefits to the improved toleration of treatment and overall survival. Exercise remains a potent strategy to increase overall and cancer-specific sur- vival. Finally, stress management has a direct effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and in optimizing the quality of daily living.

## Sources

The typical Western diet is largely devoid of dietary fiber, being com- posed principally of refined grains and other highly digestible sources of starch, sugar, various fats, and animal products. Children, in par- ticular, are commonly fiber deficient, with daily intakes often under 5 g and with nearly no soluble fiber. Likewise, many adults in Western society consume 5 to 10 g of fiber daily as opposed to the 35 to 50 g that is considered desirable or at least minimal for optimal health. Moreover, because most fiber in the Western diet is derived from cereal grains, the intake of viscous soluble fiber is typically highly inadequate. A whole-foods-based diet focusing on a large intake of vegetables and fruits as well as unrefined whole grains and legumes should be the foundation of a healthy lifestyle. With a whole-foods-based diet, it is certain that dietary fiber intake will substantially increase.7 Efforts continue to fortify the Western diet with dietary fiber through the use of various fibers as food additives or ingredients as well as the use of readily accepted fiber supplements.

## Health Effects

There are compelling epidemiological and experimental data associ- ating numerous disorders, at least in part, with a lack of dietary fiber. Ischemic heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, over- weight and obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as well as gastrointestinal disorders such as diverticulosis, irritable bowel disease, colon cancer, and cholelithiasis are just a few of the many conditions that seem to be influenced by the adequacy of dietary fiber intake.8 Numerous studies have demonstrated that certain fibers decrease the glycemic response to food, promote satiety, lower serum choles- terol, promote bowel regularity, positively influence colonic micro- flora, provide nutritional substrates for colonic mucosal cells, improve mucosal barrier function, and sequester and eliminate toxic and car- cinogenic dietary and environmental compounds. Viscous dietary fibers are clearly correlated with moderation in blood glucose and cholesterol concentrations, prolonged gastric emp- tying, and slower transit time through the small intestine.9 Among viscous fibers, fermentability is mostly associated with large bowel function. Rapidly fermented fiber sources provide substrates for short- chain fatty acid (SCFA) production by microflora in the large bowel, whereas slowly or incompletely fermented fiber sources improve bowel health by promoting laxation, reducing colonic transit time, and increasing stool weight.10

# MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF DIETARY FIBER

Dietary fiber exerts its effects through an interaction between the phys- ical properties it imparts to food and a complex array of microbio- logical, biochemical, and neurohormonal influences. Dietary fiber has a strong influence on the palatability of food, thus influencing inges- tive behavior. In the stomach, fiber affects the volume and viscosity of food, which has a significant effect on satiety. This “volumetric” effect on food promotes a sense of fullness and a delay in gastric emptying, which tends to naturally result in a decrease in caloric intake. Various fibers differ dramatically in their ability to impart volume and viscos- ity to foods. Becoming familiar with the use of highly viscous soluble fibers enables healthcare providers to teach patients to choose an eat- ing strategy that promotes and maintains satiety while consuming a diet that is lower in caloric density.

## Viscosity of Fiber

Viscosity as related to dietary fiber refers to the ability of some polysac- charides to thicken or form gels when mixed with fluids, resulting from physical entanglements and hydrophilic interactions among the polysac- charide constituents within the fluid or solution.11 Gums, pectins, and β -glucans make up the majority of viscous dietary fibers. The viscosity that a fiber imparts to the gastric and small intestinal contents is directly correlated with the ability of the fiber to reduce postprandial glycemic response, promote satiety, decrease serum cholesterol, and decrease serum uric acid.12 The viscosity of fiber is also thought to play an import- ant role in the augmentation of gut mucosal protection through the stimulation of enteral mucus production and goblet-cell hypertrophy and replication.13 Additionally, those viscous fibers that are largely fer- mented by colonic microflora exert a wide array of physiological effects through the production of SCFAs (the principle energy substrates of colonocytes), the promotion of beneficial colonic microbial populations, and the augmentation of important gut-derived peptide hormones. The viscosity of fiber is best measured by methods that quantify a hydrated fiber’s internal friction and its ability to resist flow. Viscosity is usually expressed in units of millipascal seconds or centipoise.14 Other factors, such as shear stress (e.g., mastication, peristalsis), acid pH, dilution, and chemical components of food, determine the real viscosity that a fiber will impart to food rather than just its in vitro viscosity. The concept of the glycemic index came about through the work of Jenkins et al. as they examined the effect of viscous fiber ingestion on glucose tolerance.15 The glycemic index of a carbohydrate-containing food is directly correlated to the viscosity of that food after ingestion. One research group was involved in several studies looking at the effects of adding a novel, highly viscous functional fiber (Polyglycoplex [PGX]) to various foods on the glycemic index, serum cholesterol, hunger, and satiety in healthy humans. The novelty of this fiber relates to its viscosity, which is higher than that of most other forms studied. Unlike some viscous fibers, such as psyllium, which are not fermented, PGX is highly fermentable and prebiotic.16 PGX, made from gluco- mannan, sodium alginate, and xanthan gum, is taken through several steps of processing, and the resultant modified fiber is approximately three times the viscosity of glucomannan, a naturally occurring fiber from the Konjac root that may possess the highest viscosity of any nat- urally occurring fiber. In addition, it was demonstrated that PGX is a novel and stable molecular entity with viscosity that is severalfold higher than its constituent ingredients, through a wide range of pH and shear-stress conditions, and when added to a variety of foods and beverages.17,18 In addition, this fiber is tasteless and disperses readily when added to food or mixed with beverages. Its viscosity evolves sev- eral minutes after initial hydration, making it very easy to consume the small amounts needed to create a highly viscous gastric milieu, leading to its resultant physiological effects. Substantial reductions in postprandial glycemia along with reduced hunger and increased satiety can be achieved with a very modest quan- tity of this highly viscous fiber. These findings support the contention that the viscosity that a fiber imparts to the gastric contents is more important than simply the grams of the fiber consumed.19–23 In a study of Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, the effects of diets supplemented with nonviscous, insoluble fiber (cellulose); nonviscous, prebiotic fiber (inulin, oligofructose); or a highly viscous, prebiotic fiber (PGX) were compared. Results showed that only the diet supplemented with highly viscous fiber substantially decreased postprandial blood glucose and insulin secretion, decreased hepatic fatty infiltration, and preserved pancreatic β -cell mass. These effects were accompanied by an increase in the production of the important glucoregulatory incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and, in a human clinical trial, the appetite-reducing hormone peptide YY (PYY).24 The substantial gly- cemic-index–modifying effects have been well confirmed in human studies.18–20

## Water-Holding Capacity

The ability of a fiber to absorb and hold on to water as it transits the gut is another factor that contributes to its functional effects. Soluble fibers have the capacity to create a stable gel that results in stomach volume being occupied and a sense of satiety being created without the addition of significant calories. The “volumetric” properties of a food consist of a food’s volume and viscosity per net quantity of calories. Those who work in the field of obesity management believe that teaching patients strategies that promote a high consumption of low-calorie-density, highly volumetric foods is a mainstay in the dietary management of overweight and obesity.25–27

## Laxation

The most common clinical application of fiber is in the maintenance of bowel regularity. Insoluble fiber, perhaps in combination with soluble fiber, is most effective in increasing stool bulk, reducing gut transit time, and increasing the frequency of defecation.28 The health-pro- moting effects of insoluble fiber from the bran of grains is well doc- umented and certainly extends past its laxative effects.29 However, the benefits of reduced stool transit time and increased fecal frequency may have more profound long-term benefits beyond the comfort that accompanies bowel regularity.30–32

<!-- chunk -->

## Prebiotics

It is recognized that certain forms of fiber are fermentable, providing an important substrate in the metabolism of gut flora. By definition, humans lack the enzymes specific to digest fiber. In the case of insoluble fiber, most gut microbes cannot use it as an energy source, and so it is typically excreted without any molecular alteration other than by form- ing a surface for the adsorption of organic matter and cations. Soluble fibers vary in their fermentability and in the specific microbes that can use them as substrates. The term “prebiotic” was coined by Gibson and Roberfroid in 1995 and was defined as an indigestible carbohydrate that is fermentable in the lower gastrointestinal tract that selectively pro- motes the growth of desirable (prebiotic) microflora and is associated with a positive health outcome.33,34 Although there may be exceptions, prebiotics tend to reduce populations of potentially pathogenic flora while promoting desirable commensals such as Bifidobacteria. Evidence suggests that this effect might play an important role in both the reduction in adiposity and in a reduction in the contribu- tion of adipocytes to inflammation. It was demonstrated that prebiotic supplementation might reduce the development of large adipocytes (those that predominate in the visceral compartment), which are highly involved in the overactivation of a wide variety of inflammatory processes that may contribute to overeating, obesity, diabetes, cardio- vascular disease, and pain.35,36 Pathways of inflammation associated with atopic disease are also intimately associated with gut flora. Both prebiotics and probiotics are believed to hold significant promise in the prevention and treatment of allergies and atopic disorders, such as eczema.37–40 The lack of sufficient intake of prebiotics early in life has lasting ill-effects on gluco-regulation, which may result in a substantial pre- dilection toward obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life.41 Decreased intake of fermentable soluble fiber may have serious consequences and may be one of the reasons for the obesity epidemic. The food industry has responded to this with the introduction of prebi- otic-fortified infant formulas. Because breast milk contains significant quantities of prebiotic oligosaccharides, adding analogous agents to infant formulas would help make these more closely mimic the natural diet. This strategy results in a gut flora predominated by Bifidobacteria rather than potential pathogens such as Clostridia and Enterobacter that tend to predominate in formula-fed infants.42 Prebiotics, namely lactulose, have been used for many years in the management of hepatic encephalopathy.43 It has long been a marvel for modifying the colonic flora, and giving lactulose can restore sanity to a delirious patient with liver failure. It is recognized that the prebi- otic effects of this treatment result in a reduction in neurotoxic bacte- rial metabolites that can normally be eliminated by the healthy liver. Similarly, prebiotics have found their place in the treatment of patients with HIV44 and in allergy prevention and treatment.45 Prebiotics may play an important role in the modification of car- cinogens and in the promotion of substances that reduce cancer risk, at least in the gastrointestinal tract.46 Dietary fiber has the capacity to sequester and increase the elimination of a wide range of organic molecules as well as metal ions. This effect, along with the resultant decrease in colonic transit time, results in reduced colonocyte expo- sure to potentially harmful xenobiotics and endogenously produced, but potentially harmful, compounds. Fermentable soluble fiber is metabolized anaerobically into SCFAs such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate. These simple molecules are the principal energy sub- strates of colonocytes, and an adequate and ongoing supply of these may reduce the risk of cancer, metabolic disorders, and other gastro- intestinal disorders, such as diverticulosis and inflammatory bowel disease.47,48

## Neuroendocrine Effects of Fiber

Perhaps the most intriguing discovery is related to the role played by dietary fiber in the modulation of important neuroendocrine physi- ology, which may be fundamentally related to the etiology of several serious disorders. Of particular interest is the effect of fiber on the density and activity of a specialized enteroendocrine cell known as the L-cell.49 The L-cell is located throughout the terminal ileum and colon, and it is responsible for the secretion of the peptide hormones GLP- 1, PYY, and oxyntomodulin.50 After a meal, oxyntomodulin and PYY are released synchronously; both act as potent anorexigens. The rapid rise of circulating hormone levels signals a change in energy status to the brain and also acts locally to enhance digestive processes. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that is also secreted by the L-cell and, as well as being an anorexigen, it plays a pivotal role in glucoregulation through the stimulation of accurately timed insulin secretion and suppres- sion of glucagon secretion from the pancreas. It has been established that diminished GLP-1 production plays a central role in the etiology of diabetes, a discovery that has led to the development of the most important class of diabetes drugs (the incretin analogs) since the discovery of insulin. A randomized clinical study demonstrated that select SCFA-producing gut bacteria were promoted by dietary fibers, improving hemoglobin A1c and alleviating type 2 diabetes, partly via increased GLP-1 production.51 Studies demonstrate that (bariatric) gastric bypass surgery results in rapid amelioration of diabetes that is out of proportion with and precedes significant weight loss.52 Evidence points to a rapid and sustained increase in circulating GLP-1 and PYY after this procedure, which has profound effects on appetite and gluco- regulation. It is thought that the malabsorption of carbohydrates and rapid gastrointestinal transit after gastric bypass results in increased delivery of carbohydrate fermentation products (SCFAs) and bile acids, both of which activate L-cells via free fatty acid (FFA) receptors and bile acid receptors.53–57 It is most interesting that fermentable soluble fiber has the potential to generate a significant supply of SCFAs that might mimic, on a lesser scale, the mechanism of gastric bypass surgery through the stimula- tion of FFA receptors, with a resultant increase in GLP-1 and PYY.58 Because viscous soluble fiber also effectively sequesters bile acids, reducing their usual absorption through the jejunum and delivering them to the same L-cells, viscous soluble fiber that is also fermentable

may exert an appetite-reducing and glucoregulating effect through L-cell activation via both FFA receptors and bile acid receptors as well as by suppression of the orexigenic (appetite stimulating) hormone ghrelin.59,60 Sequestration of bile acids by viscous soluble fiber is also known to be a principal mechanism by which viscous fiber lowers serum cholesterol because sequestration of bile acids decreases the entero- hepatic recycling of bile acids, a major cholesterol reservoir for the human.61


With the abundant and ever-growing evidence that has elevated the role of fiber well beyond its place in the promotion of bowel regularity, dietary fiber should be respected by healthcare providers as an import- ant prophylactic and therapeutic agent. The importance of viscous, fermentable soluble fiber in the prevention and management of obesity and diabetes is of particular importance to clinicians who are on the front lines facing the obesity epidemic. It is clear that fiber, especially viscous and (prebiotic) fermentable soluble fiber, plays a key role in the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovas- cular disease, cancers, atopic illness, and a wide range of gastrointes- tinal disorders. It is also clear that the lack of adequate dietary fiber, particularly prebiotic and viscous fibers in childhood and infancy, may set the stage for a higher risk of the same array of disorders, and that some of that increased risk may linger for the remainder of life. Clinicians must develop effective strategies to educate their patients and assist them in the incorporation of much higher levels of fiber in their daily diet. Because the greatest benefits from fiber are derived from highly viscous, prebiotic fibers, clinicians should become espe- cially knowledgeable in the effective use of these agents, particularly when treating patients who are obese or exhibit dysglycemia. In 1968, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)–contaminated rice-bran cooking oil poisoned a great number of Japanese individuals in what came to be called “Yusho disease” (oil poisoning). Rice-bran fiber (RBF) has demonstrated the ability to bind PCBs and other toxicants, including the combustion by-product benzo(a)pyrene. When mea- sured against other fibers, RBF dramatically reduced the reabsorption of PCBs from the intestines in animals, and in PCB-exposed animals, RBF increased fecal PCB excretion by 6.6 times and spinach fiber by 4.1 times.62 Yusho patients who consumed 7 to 10 g of fermented RBF three times daily (after each meal) for a year enjoyed 81% greater elim- ination of furans and 74% greater elimination of dioxins compared with those not consuming the fiber.63

# DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dietary fiber intake for typical Americans is usually less than desir- able, with typical intakes averaging only 14 to 15 g/day and children consuming less than 5 g/day.64 The American Dietetic Association cur- rently recommends that healthy adults should consume 20 to 35 g of fiber per day, and children should consume at least 5 g/day plus 1 g for every year of their age.65 The American Dietetic Association points out that insoluble, nonfermentable, and low-viscosity fiber is princi- pally consumed to promote laxation and other aspects of colon health, whereas viscous soluble fibers are necessary to reduce serum choles- terol, blunt postprandial glycemic response, and promote satiety. A fiber-rich meal, particularly a meal high in viscous, soluble fiber, is processed more slowly, promoting earlier satiety, and is frequently less calorically dense and lower in fat and added sugars. All of these char- acteristics are typical of a dietary profile optimized to treat and prevent obesity. Unfortunately, viscous soluble fiber is not easily incorporated into the regular diet, but fiber supplements may provide a practical means to ensure that most meals contain optimal quantities of vis- cous fiber. Pal et al.66 at Curtin University in Australia demonstrated the utility of high-dose psyllium given as a premeal supplement as an adjunct to a calorie-reduced weight loss program. However, the dos- age of psyllium used in this application was very large (12 g with each meal) and might pose a compliance problem for many subjects. Using very high-viscosity fiber (such as PGX) may overcome this limitation because the dosages required to achieve a reduction in postprandial glycemia and an increase in satiety may be much less than those of fibers with lesser viscosity.19,67


Clinicians prescribing higher doses of supplementary fibers should be aware of the potential drug–food interactions in those patients requir- ing pharmaceuticals. Most fiber, especially viscous fibers, has the poten- tial to modify the rate or total absorption of various drugs.68 In most cases, taking medications 1 hour before or 2 hours after consumption of the supplementary fiber will reduce the effect of this phenomenon.

impairs protein digestion and mineral disassociation. In addition, the change in pH can adversely affect gut microbial flora, including the promotion of an overgrowth of Helicobacter pylori. Finally, most nutri- tion-oriented physicians believe that lack of acid, not excess, is the true culprit in most patients with indigestion. Most people use these drugs because they self-diagnose hyperacid- ity. However, in most cases, the symptoms of reflux esophagitis are most often caused by overeating or eating foods that promote gastric reflux, not excessive acid production. See the chapter on GERD for a more complete discussion. Other common causes of heartburn or indigestion are as follows: • Obesity • Cigarette smoking • Chocolate • Fried foods • Carbonated beverages • Alcohol • Coffee These factors most often either increase intraabdominal pressure or decrease the tone of the esophageal sphincter. Another important dietary consideration is the glycemic load of a meal. In the Study on the Epidemiology of Psychological, Alimentary Health and Nutrition (SEPAHAN), a high-glycemic-load meal or habitual diet was significantly associated with heartburn/dyspepsia, especially in men.5 Complaints of indigestion and heartburn may also be a sign of a hiatal hernia. Although 50% of people older than 50 years have hiatal hernias, only 5% of patients with hiatal hernias experience reflux esoph- agitis and/or symptoms of GERD. Perhaps the most effective treatment of chronic reflux esophagitis and symptomatic hiatal hernias is to use gravity. The standard recommendation is to place 4-inch blocks under the bedposts at the head of the patient’s bed. This elevation of the head is very effective in many cases. Another recommendation is for the patient to drink a glass of alkaline water (pH > 8.8) or lemon water after a meal. This practice was compared with proton pump inhibitors in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux and was found to produce better results based on changes in Reflux Symptom Index (RSI).6

## Hypochlorhydria

In the patient with chronic indigestion, rather than focusing on block- ing the digestive process with antacids, the natural approach focuses on aiding digestion. Although much is said about hyperacidity conditions, a more common cause of indigestion is a lack of gastric acid secretion. Many symptoms and signs suggest impaired gastric acid secretion, and several specific diseases have been associated with insufficient gastric acid output.7–17 They are listed in Boxes 133.1 and 133.2. Several studies have shown that the ability to secrete gastric acid decreases with age.18–20 Some studies found low stomach acidity in more than half of the subjects older than 60 years. The best method of diagnosing a lack of gastric acid is the Heidelberg gastric analysis (see Chapter 17).21 Wright22 suggested that the response to a bicarbonate challenge during Heidelberg gastric analysis, not simply resting pH, was the true test of the functional ability of the stomach to secrete acid. Because the Heidelberg gastric acid analysis is not widely available, a clinical trial of hydrochloric acid (HCl) supplements can be used, as described in Appendix 8.

## Etiology of Hypochlorhydria

Like peptic ulcer disease, achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria have been linked to the overgrowth of the bacteria H. pylori. Approximately 90% to 100% of patients with duodenal ulcers, 70% of patients with gastric ulcers, and about 50% of people older than 50 years test positive for H. pylori. The presence of H. pylori is determined by measuring the level of antibodies to H. pylori in the blood or saliva or by culturing material collected during an endoscopy as well as measuring the breath for urea. A breath test is also available for assessment of current H. pylori activity. Low gastric output is thought to predispose to H. pylori coloniza- tion, and H. pylori colonization increases gastric pH, thereby setting up a positive-feedback scenario and increasing the likelihood of col- onization of the stomach and duodenum by other organisms. Not surprisingly, HCl antisecretory drugs (H 2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) may promote H. pylori overgrowth. Patients with H. pylori experience an exaggerated response in elevations of pH with antisecretory therapy. Eradication of H. pylori is associated with a return to normal gastric acidity and pepsinogen ratio.23 Although the typical conventional medicine approach is to focus only on the infective agent, the usual host defense factors are equally import- ant. Unfortunately, research has focused on eradicating the organism, and there is little information on protective factors against infection. Proposed protective factors against H. pylori–induced intestinal damage include maintaining a low pH and ensuring adequate antioxidant defense mecha- nisms. Low levels of vitamin C and vitamin E and other antioxidant factors in the gastric juice appear to not only lead to the progression of H. pylori colonization but also to contribute to ulcer formation because the mech- anism by which H. pylori damages the stomach and intestinal mucosa is oxidative.24 Furthermore, antioxidant status and gastric acid output appear to explain the observation that most people infected with H. pylori do not experience peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer. For more infor- mation on natural approaches for eradicating H. pylori, see Chapter 207. One natural medicine that may be useful against H. pylori is bovine lactoferrin. Lactoferrin exerts broad-spectrum antimicrobial action because it has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the growth of disease-causing protozoa, yeast, bacteria, and viruses. More important than its ability to kill organisms is the discovery that lactoferrin pre- vents the attachment of disease-causing organisms to cells that line the mouth and entire gastrointestinal tract. At the same time, lactoferrin is a powerful booster of health-promoting bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species. By preventing the growth of harmful bacte- ria while promoting the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria, lactoferrin assists in the development of proper intestinal flora. The standard medical treatment of H. pylori infection is a 1- or 2-week course of triple-drug therapy. It involves taking two antibiotics to kill the bacteria and an acid-suppressor drug. Based on the results of clinical trials, lactoferrin alone or in combination with triple ther- apy may be an excellent treatment option. In one study, 151 patients testing positive for H. pylori with indigestion symptoms were given either triple therapy alone or with lactoferrin. H. pylori status assessed 8 weeks after the end of the treatment indicated a 95.9% eradication rate for the group receiving the lactoferrin; the other group had only a 72.5% eradication rate.25 The effective dose of lactoferrin in this appli- cation is 300 mg/day.

## Pancreatic Insufficiency

The most severe level of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is seen in cystic fibrosis. Next in severity is the EPI associated with the late stages of pancreatitis. These more severe causes of EPI are most often easily recognized, but causes of mild EPI are more insidious and diffi- cult to diagnose. Patients with type 1 diabetes not only have damaged beta cells, but the enzyme-producing alpha cells are damaged as well. Both physical symptoms and laboratory tests can be used to assess pancreatic function in patients in whom mild EPI is suspected. Common symptoms of EPI are abdominal bloating and discomfort, gas, indigestion, and the passing of undigested food in the stool. For laboratory diagnosis, a comprehensive stool and digestive analysis (discussed in Chapter 28) is quite useful. In addition, the measure- ment of fecal elastase 1 concentrations using an enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay is an accepted indirect test of the exocrine pancreatic function. It shows higher sensitivity and specificity for EPI than does fecal chymotrypsin determination and is comparable to oral pancreatic function tests, such as the pancreolauryl test.26 However, the test may not show levels of active secreted enzymes. Each pancreatic enzyme has a very narrow range of pH activity as well as being inhibited by sev- eral foods, microbial compounds, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, and many other factors. Even so, the measurement of fecal elas- tase has shown that pancreatic insufficiency is associated with normal aging in healthy populations, especially after age 70 years.27 Patients may have few symptoms associated with EPI, for example, steatorrhea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, but they may experience gas, bloating, and indigestion.

## Digestive Enzyme Supplements

Pancreatic enzyme products are an effective treatment for EPI and are widely used. Most commercial preparations are prepared from fresh hog pancreas (i.e., pancreatin) (see Chapter 100 for a full discussion). Enzyme products are often enteric coated, primarily to protect the more fragile porcine lipase. However, some studies have shown that non–enteric-coated enzyme preparations outperform enteric-coated products if they are given before a meal (for digestive purposes) or on an empty stomach (for anti-inflammatory effects). In general, there is no significant difference in clinical response to various delivery forms of pancreatin.28 Alternatives to porcine pancreatin include plants (e.g., brome- lain, papain, etc.) and enzymes extracted from various microbes or

yeast (e.g., Aspergillus oryzae). These enzymes are more resistant to digestive secretions and have a broader range of activity, including pH range (see Chapter 59, Bromelain, and Chapter 95, Microbial Enzyme Therapy). One double-blind crossover trial in 17 patients with severe EPI and steatorrhea compared the effects of a non–enteric-coated pan- creatic enzyme preparation (360,000 lipase U/day), an enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme preparation (100,000 lipase U/day), and a fun- gal enzyme preparation (75,000 lipase U/ day).25 All three treatment preparations in both groups yielded a significant reduction in total daily stool weight and total daily fecal fat excretion compared with controls. It is interesting to point out, however, that the fungal enzyme preparation produced similar benefit at three-fourths the dose of the enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme and one-fifth the dose of the non– enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme preparation.

# PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENTS

Probiotic supplementation may be useful in improving digestion. However, it is important to point out that although probiotics may play a role in general digestive health, immune function, and other aspects of the microbiome, probiotics do not directly aid digestion in terms of breaking down food into smaller units.

was observed in both white and black children and in white children with hypercholesterolemia. In the latter study group, the 5,10-meth- ylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) TT genotype tended to be most frequent in children with a parental history of cardiac disease.8 Epidemiological evidence showed homocysteine levels to be more than 45% lower in Westernized adult black Africans than in age-matched white adults, revealing racial genetic differences in homocysteine metabolism.9 The MTHFR gene has two different alleles, where the “T” allele is associated with decreased enzyme activity, hyperhomocysteinemia, and increased risk for thromboembolism in coronary heart disease. The presence of the “C” allele is correlated to lower homocysteine lev- els and, not surprisingly, may even provide protection against occlu- sion of coronary arteries. One Hungarian study concluded that the carriers of the T allele with coronary heart disease died earlier due to myocardial infarction.10

## Lifestyle

An association between coffee and black tea consumption and the concentration of total homocysteine in plasma has been reported.11 A marked positive dose–response relation between coffee consump- tion and plasma homocysteine levels was observed. The relationship was most marked in males and females consuming more than eight cups of coffee per day. The combination of cigarette smoking and high coffee intake was associated with particularly high homocysteine con- centrations.12 Long-term ingestion of alcohol has also been associated with increased homocysteine levels.13,14 Plasma total homocysteine is inversely related to exercise.15

## Nutritional Relationships

Nutrition affects homocysteine concentrations in both men and women. For example, individuals in the lowest quartiles for serum folate and vitamin B 12 have significantly higher concentrations of homocysteine, and men in the lowest quartile of serum pyridoxal 5 ′ -phosphate (P5P; the bioactive form of vitamin B 6 ) also have increased homocysteine concentrations.2

## Methionine

Metabolism of the amino acid methionine, a limiting amino acid in the synthesis of many proteins, affects several biochemical pathways involving the production of nutrients that are essential to the optimal functioning of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and nervous systems. Homocysteine is an intermediate product of methionine metab- olism and is metabolized by two pathways: the remethylation path- way, which regenerates methionine; and the transsulfuration pathway, which degrades homocysteine into cysteine and then taurine. In essence, the intermediate metabolite homocysteine is located at a met- abolic crossroads, so it directly and indirectly affects all methyl and sulfur group metabolism occurring in the body. Experiments demon- strated that high levels of l-homocysteine and adenosine in the cell inhibit all methylation reactions.16 The remethylation pathway (Fig. 134.1) comprises two inter- secting biochemical pathways and results in the transfer of a methyl group (CH 3 ) to homocysteine by either methylcobalamin or betaine (trimethylglycine). Methylcobalamin originally receives its methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) or 5-methyltetrahydrofo- late (5-methylTHF). After remethylation, methionine can be reused HO MOCYSTE IN E ME THIONINE ATP/Mg DMG Glycine SAH SAMe Adenosine Serine Cysteine Taurine P5P P5P CH 3 -group acceptor Betaine Methylcobalamin Cob (II) alamin SAMe 5-methylTHF THF SAH Methionine synthase Fig. 134.1 Homocysteine metabolism.

to produce SAMe, the body’s “universal methyl donor,” which par- ticipates in several key metabolic pathways, including methylation of DNA and myelin, synthesis of carnitine, coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ), cre- atine, epinephrine, melatonin, methylcobalamin, and phosphatidyl- choline (PC), as well as Phase II methylation detoxification reactions. The transsulfuration pathway of methionine/homocysteine degra- dation (see Fig. 134.1) produces the amino acids cysteine and taurine, which are important nutrients for cardiac health, hepatic detoxifica- tion, cholesterol excretion, bile salts formation, and glutathione (GSH) production. This pathway depends on adequate dietary intake and hepatic conversion of vitamin B 6 into its active form, P5P. The amino acid serine, a down-line metabolite generated from betaine via the homocysteine remethylation pathway, is also necessary. In addition to 5-methylTHF, methylcobalamin, betaine, and P5P, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been reported to significantly lower homocysteine levels.17

## S-Adenosylhomocysteine

The metabolic precursor of homocysteine in all tissues is S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is more difficult to measure than homocysteine but has recently been indicated as a more sensi- tive marker for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease. S-adenosylhomocysteine is formed by the demethylation of SAMe (Fig. 134.2). S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase catalyzes the hydro- lysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine and homocysteine. S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency is a genetic disorder of methionine metabolism that results in slow psychomotor development. Increased levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine may occur when the intracellular concentration of homocysteine increases.18–20

## Methyltetrahydrofolate

Folates function as carbon donors in the synthesis of serine from gly- cine, directly in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidine bases, and indirectly in the synthesis of transfer RNA. Folates also function as methyl donors to create methylcobalamin, which is used for remethyl- ation of homocysteine to methionine. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate and requires several met- abolic steps within the cell to be converted into the metabolically active tetrahydrofolate. It is an oxidized synthetic water-soluble mem- ber of the vitamin-B complex family and is found in fortified foods, supplements, and pharmaceuticals. L-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (L-5-methyl-THF) is the predominant form of dietary folate that is transported into peripheral tissues to be used for cellular metabolism. Synthesis of the active forms of folate is a complex process requir- ing several enzymes, as well as adequate supplies of niacin, P5P, and serine as cofactors (Fig. 134.3). In plants, folate is formed from a hetero-bicyclic pteridine ring, para-aminobenzoic acid, and glutamic acid. Folate is initially deconjugated in the cells of the intestinal wall to the monoglutamate form. This is then reduced to dihydrofolate and then to tetrahydrofolate (THF) via folate and dihydrofolate reductase. Both enzymes require reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (niacin dependent) as a cofactor. Serine combines with P5P to transfer a hydroxymethyl group to THF. This results in the forma- tion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-methyleneTHF) and gly- cine. This molecule is of central importance, being the precursor of the metabolically active 5-methylTHF, which is involved in homocysteine metabolism, and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (involved in purine syn- thesis), as well as functioning on its own in the generation of thymine side chains for incorporation into DNA.

## 988SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

The following may contribute to a deficiency of folate: • A deficient food supply • A defect in utilization, as in alcoholics • Malabsorption • Increased needs in pregnant women and cancer patients • Metabolic interference by drugs • Folate losses in hemodialysis • Enzyme or cofactor deficiency necessary for the generation of folate Individuals using supplements or consuming either breakfast cere- als or green leafy vegetables have significantly greater plasma folate and lower homocysteine levels than those who do not.1 Folinic acid (5-formylTHF), available supplementally as calcium folinate (also known as leucovorin calcium), is an immediate precur- sor to 5,10-methyleneTHF and 5-methylTHF. Folinic acid can correct deficiencies of the active forms of folate, is more stable than folic acid, and has a longer half-life in the body. Folinic acid also readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and is slowly cleared, compared with folic acid, which is poorly transported into the brain and, once in the central ner- vous system (CNS), is rapidly cleared.21

## Methylcobalamin

The coenzyme form of vitamin B 12 is a complex molecule containing cobalt bound to five nitrogens and one carbon. The metal–carbon bond found on this coenzyme is the only known biological example of this type of linkage. The use of cobalt in the two biologically active forms of cobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, is the only known function of this metal in biological systems. In humans, the cobalt in cobalamin exists in a univalent oxidation state, designated as cob(I)alamin. The compound commonly referred to as vitamin B 12 has a cyanide molecule at the metal–carbon position, and the oxidation state of the cobalt is +3 instead of the biologically active +1. To be used in the body, the cyanide molecule must be removed. It is thought that the compound GSH may perform this function. Other available forms of vitamin B 12 include hydroxocobalamin and the two active forms, adenosylcobalamin (cobamamide) and methylcobalamin. The absorption of dietary cobalamin requires the formation of a complex between dietary vitamin B 12 and R-proteins and the secretion, by the stomach mucosa, of intrinsic factor. The vitamin B 12 complex is split by pancreatic proteases, and the released vitamin B 12 attaches to intrinsic factor and is absorbed in the distal ileum. The amount of cobalamin required in the diet is low, and even people with pernicious anemia can generally absorb sufficient amounts if the coenzyme is sup- plemented at a high enough dosage. Although the basic cobalamin molecule is only synthesized by microorganisms, all mammalian cells can convert this into the coen- zymes adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin. Adenosylcobalamin is the major form in cellular tissues, where it is retained in the mito- chondria. Methylcobalamin predominates in blood plasma and certain other body fluids and in cells found in the cytosol. Adenosylcobalamin functions in reactions in which hydrogen groups and organic groups exchange places. In humans, adenosyl- cobalamin is required in only two reactions: the catabolic isomeri- zation of methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA, and interconversion of α - and β -leucine. After its formation from meth- ylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA is either involved in the synthesis of porphyrin molecules (along with glycine) or it transfers its CoA to form acetyl-CoA. The latter reaction is magnesium dependent, and the remaining succinate is fed into the citric acid cycle. Deficiencies in this coenzyme form of vitamin B 12 result in increased amounts of methyl- malonyl-CoA and generally an increase in glycine levels. Methylcobalamin’s only known biological function in humans is in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via the enzyme methionine synthase, also known as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homo- cysteine methyltransferase. To originally form methylcobalamin from cyanocobalamin or other Cob(III)alamin or Cob(II)alamin precur- sors, SAMe must be available to supply a methyl group. Once meth- ylcobalamin is formed, it functions in the regeneration of methionine by transferring its methyl group to homocysteine. Methyl-cobalamin can then be regenerated by 5-methylTHF (Fig. 134.4). The cell’s abil- ity to methylate important compounds such as proteins, lipids, and myelin is compromised by a deficiency of either folate or vitamin B 12 .22 Shortages of folate, SAMe, or a dietary deficiency of cobalamin lead to a decrease in the generation of methylcobalamin and a subsequent impairment of homocysteine metabolism. Because lack of methylco- balamin leads to depressed DNA synthesis, rapidly dividing cells in the brain and elsewhere are affected.

At least 12 different inherited inborn errors of metabolism related to cobalamin are known. Abnormalities are detectable by urine and plasma assays of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine and by plasma and erythrocyte analysis of cobalamin coenzymes, which can reveal deficiencies of methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin.23

## Betaine

The metabolic pathways of betaine, methionine, methylcobalamin, and methylTHF are interrelated, intersecting at the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine. This regeneration is accomplished in one of two ways. One involves the generation in the cytosol of 5- methylTHF from methylene THF and the transfer of its methyl group to regenerate methylcobalamin, which then acts as a coenzyme in the regeneration of methionine. Because THF and its derivatives can only cross the mitochondrial membrane slowly, inside, the mito- chondria regeneration of methionine relies on recovery of a methyl group from betaine. Betaine donates one of its three methyl groups via the enzyme beta- ine-homocysteine methyltransferase to homocysteine, resulting in the regeneration of methionine. After the donation of the methyl group, one molecule of dimethylglycine remains. This molecule is oxidized to glycine and to two molecules of formaldehyde by riboflavin-depen- dent enzymes. The formaldehyde can combine with THF within the mitochondria to generate methylenetetrahydrofolate, which can be converted to 5-methylTHF and subsequently used as a methyl donor (Fig. 134.5). In animal studies, a disturbance in the metabolism of either of the two methyl-donor pathways, due to limited availability of either beta- ine or folates and vitamin B 12 , affects levels of nutrients in the coexist- ing pathway, because more of a drain is placed on the other pathway as a source of methyl groups. Rats fed diets deficient in choline and methionine had hepatic folate concentrations half that of controls after 5 weeks.24 During choline deficiency, hepatic SAMe concentrations were also shown to decrease by as much as 50%.25 Similarly, THF defi- ciency resulted in decreased hepatic total choline levels.26 Cyanocobalamin (cob(III)alamin) 5,10-methylene- tetrahydrofolate 5-methyl- tetrahydrofolate Tetrahydrofolate Cob(II)alamin Cob(I)alamin Succinyl CoA Methylmalonyl CoA Adenosylcobalamin (cobamamide) (dibencozide) SAMe Methyl- cobalamin Cob(I)alamin MethionineHomocysteine Folinic acid

## 990SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

Patients with a congenital deficiency of the enzyme MTHFR, which is needed for the formation of 5-methylTHF, have reduced levels of both methionine and SAMe in the cerebrospinal fluid and show demy- elination in the brain and degeneration of the spinal cord. Methionine is effective in the treatment of some of these patients; however, betaine was shown to restore cerebrospinal fluid SAMe levels to normal and to prevent the progression of neurological symptoms in all patients in whom it was tried.27 Betaine supplementation has been shown to reduce homocysteine levels28 while resulting in modest increases of plasma serine and cyste- ine levels.29 Stimulation of betaine-dependent homocysteine remeth- ylation causes a commensurate decrease in plasma homocysteine that can be maintained as long as supplemental betaine is taken.30 Serine levels are depressed in some individuals with excess homo- cysteine who are treated with folic acid, cobalamin, and vitamin B 6 .31 Because serine is required (1) for the conversion of folic acid to its active form, (2) as a shuttle for methyl groups between the cytosol and the mitochondria, and (3) as a cofactor in the transsulfuration pathway of methionine/homocysteine metabolism, supplementation with beta- ine should be included with folic acid, cobalamin, and P5P to optimize the interrelated pathways of homocysteine metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pyridoxal 5´-Phosphate

P5P is the active coenzyme form of vitamin B 6 . This cofactor is involved in myriad biological processes, including the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine. This degradation pathway involves a two-step process, resulting in the formation of cystathionine and its subsequent cleavage to cysteine. Cystathionine synthase and cystathionase require P5P as a cofactor, and the committed first step in the degradation of homocyste- ine, cystathionine synthase, also requires serine, a downstream metab- olite of betaine (Fig. 134.6). Some studies suggest that cystathionine could be a useful marker to assess the effect of vitamin B 6 and should be monitored with homocysteine to better elucidate clinical outcomes.32 Once cysteine is generated, it can be directed into several different pathways, including synthesis of GSH, acetyl-CoA, and taurine. Three pathways from cysteine to taurine are known; all require P5P.

# RENAL FUNCTION

Impaired kidney function appears to be a factor in raised homocyste- ine concentrations.33 It has been shown that a decreased glomerular filtration rate may be a contributing factor, and some researchers sug- gest that hyperhomocysteinemia may actually reflect early nephroscle- rosis,8 although other studies demonstrate only a minor renal influence.34 Fenofibrate treatment, known to increase homocysteine levels, is also known to promote elevations in serum creatinine (see “Pharmaceutic Drug Effects on Homocysteine”).35 Cystatin C, a creat- inine-independent indicator of glomerular filtration rate, has also been shown to be well associated with homocysteine levels in kidney trans- plantation patients, as well as those with coronary disease.35,36

# PHARMACEUTIC DRUG EFFECTS ON

# HOMOCYSTEINE

Fibrates such as gemfibrozil are a class of drugs used to lower tri- glycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein levels. In a paradoxical effect working against a safer cardiac risk profile, these drugs have been observed to raise homocysteine levels up to 40%.35,37,38 The mecha- nism of this observation is unknown, although it seems that renal mechanisms may be involved (see “Renal Function”). Thiazides and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are often a first-line conventional treatment to lower elevated blood pressure. One preliminary, randomized, prospective treatment study investigated patients with hypertension after treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or captopril. In this study, vitamins B 6 , B 12 , folic acid, creatinine, and cystatin C were used as parameters of renal function. For 31 and days, respectively, 21 patients were prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, and 19 were prescribed captopril. It was found that hydrochlorothi- azide, but not captopril, significantly raised homocysteine by 16%, as well as creatinine and cystatin C.39

# EFFECT OF HOMOCYSTEINE ON KEY NUTRIENTS

Because of its central role in sulfur- and methyl-group metabolism, elevated levels of homocysteine would be expected to negatively affect the biosynthesis of all of the following: SAMe, carnitine, chondroitin sulfates, CoA, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ 10) , creatine, cysteine, dimethylgly- cine, epinephrine, glucosamine sulfate, glutathione (GSH), glycine, melatonin, pantethine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, ser- ine, and taurine.

## S-Adenosylmethionine

SAMe is formed by the transfer of an adenosyl group from adenosine triphosphate to the sulfur atom of methionine. This reaction requires magnesium as a cofactor. When methyl groups are transferred from SAMe, S-adenosylhomocysteine is formed. This is then hydrolyzed to release the adenosine and results in the formation of homocysteine. SAMe is known to be used in the synthesis of the following com- pounds: carnitine, CoQ 10 , creatine, methylcobalamin from cob(III) alamin, 1-methylnicotinamide, N-methyltryptamine, PC, and poly- amines. It is also used in methylation reactions as part of hepatic Phase II detoxification.

## Carnitine

A trimethylated amino acid roughly similar in structure to choline, carnitine is a cofactor for the transformation of free long-chain fatty acids into acyl-carnitines and their transport into a mitochondrial matrix, where they undergo β -oxidation for cellular energy produc- tion. Synthesis of carnitine begins with the methylation of the amino acid l-lysine by SAMe. Methionine, magnesium, vitamin C, iron, P5P, and niacin, along with the cofactors responsible for regenerating SAMe from homocysteine (5-methylTHF, methylcobalamin, and betaine), are required for optimal carnitine synthesis (Fig. 134.7).

A pivotal enzyme in carnitine synthesis, betaine aldehyde dehy- drogenase, is the same enzyme responsible for the synthesis of beta- ine from choline. Studies suggest this enzyme has a preference for the choline–betaine conversion and that choline supplementation may decrease carnitine synthesis; therefore it may be of greater benefit to supplement with betaine rather than its precursor, choline.40,41

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulfated Proteoglycans

Proteoglycans are amino sugars found in all tissues, the highest being in cartilage, tendons, ligaments, synovial fluid, skin, fingers, toenails, heart valves, and the basement membrane of all blood vessels. Perhaps the most widely known of the amino sugars are the chondroitin sul- fates and glucosamine sulfate (see Chapter 83 for further discussion). Chondroitin sulfates are primarily composed of alternating resi- dues of N-acetyl-d-galactosamine and d-glucuronate. Sulfate residues are present on C-4 of the galactosamine residues in one type of chon- droitin and on C-6 in another. Glucosamine sulfate is a simple mol- ecule composed of glucose, the amino acid glutamine, and a sulfate group. Other sulfated proteoglycans include dermatan sulfates, kera- tan sulfates, and heparan sulfates. High levels of homocysteine are likely to negatively affect the for- mation of the sulfated amino sugars because although some sulfates are present in the diet, the sulfoxidation of cysteine is an important source of sulfate molecules. The sulfoxidation pathway proceeds through the toxic intermediate sulfite and requires molybdenum as a cofactor.

## Coenzyme A

CoA consists of an adenine nucleotide and phosphopantetheine. Contained within the structure of this coenzyme is pantothenic acid; however, the reactive component of the molecule is a sulfhydryl group that is not contained within the vitamin. To form the sulfhydryl-con- taining molecule (pantetheine), pantothenic acid must combine with cysteamine. Cysteamine is formed through conjugation and decarbox- ylation reactions of cysteine. The disulfate form of pantetheine, known as pantethine, as opposed to pantothenic acid, bypasses cysteine conju- gation and decarboxylation. This might account for some of the clini- cal benefits seen with pantethine supplementation that have not been reproduced with the supplementation of pantothenic acid. See Fig. 134.8 A to D for the chemical structures of pantetheine, pantethine, pantothenic acid, and cysteamine.

## Coenzyme Q

## 10

CoQ 10 is a fat-soluble quinone occurring in the mitochondria of each cell (see Chapter 68 for a full discussion). The primary biochemical action of CoQ 10 is as a cofactor in the electron transport chain, the biochemical pathway that generates adenosine triphosphate. Because most cellular functions depend on an adequate supply of adenosine triphosphate, CoQ 10 is essential for the health of virtually all human tissues and organs. CoQ 10 also functions as an antioxidant, assisting in the recycling of vitamin E.42,43 Biosynthesis of CoQ 10 begins with the amino acid tyrosine. Pantothenic acid, P5P, and vitamin C are all required for the initial steps in its synthesis. An isoprenyl side chain from farnesyl diphosphate, an intermediate in cholesterol synthesis between 3-hydroxy-3-methylgl- utaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) and squalene, is then added. An inadequate supply of this intermediate, which can be caused by HMG-CoA reduc- tase inhibitors (cholesterol-lowering drugs of the statin family), results in decreased levels of CoQ 10 .44 In two of the final steps in the synthesis of CoQ 10 , methyl groups are provided by SAMe (Fig. 134.9). Adequate dietary methionine and a sufficient supply of the nutrients required for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (5-methylTHF, methylcobalamin, and betaine) are required to generate sufficient SAMe. Suboptimal amounts of SAMe may negatively affect the body’s ability to synthesize sufficient CoQ 10 . This relationship between SAMe and CoQ 10 has been suggested in various animal studies.45,46 Lysine S-Adenosylmethionine S-Adenosylhomocysteine Trimethyllysine N6-Trimethyl-3-hydroxylysine 4-Trimethylaminobutyraldehyde 4-Trimethylaminobutyrate Carnitine Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase Fe2+, ascorbic acid Pyridoxal 5´-phosphate Glycine B 3 Fe2+, ascorbic acid

## Creatine

In humans, more than 95% of the total creatine content is located in skeletal muscle, of which approximately one third is in its free form as creatine, also known as methyl-guanidinoacetic acid, whereas the remainder is present in a phosphorylated form as creatine phosphate (also called phosphocreatine). Creatine phosphate is used within skele- tal muscle as a means of storing high-energy phosphate bonds. Creatine is formed in the liver, kidney, and pancreas, beginning with the combination of arginine and glycine to produce guanidi- noacetate. A methyl group from SAMe is then transferred, result- ing in the formation of creatine. The by-product of this reaction, S-adenosylhomocysteine, is subsequently hydrolyzed into homocyste- ine and adenosine. To optimize the endogenous production of creatine, the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine must be available as substrates. Additionally, cofactors needed to optimize remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine are required to recycle the homo- cysteine to methionine for reuse as SAMe (Fig. 134.10). Serum creatine levels have been positively correlated with plasma homocysteine levels (i.e., as creatine levels rise, so do homocysteine levels).47

## Epinephrine and Melatonin

Derivatives of the aromatic amino acids, l-tyrosine and l-tryptophan, require methylation for the biosynthesis of their down-line metabolites. The biosynthesis of catecholamines begins with the amino acid l-ty- rosine and proceeds through dopa and dopamine, resulting in the forma- tion of norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter substance found in most sympathetic nerve terminals, as well as in some synapses of the CNS. In the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, a methyl group is provided by SAMe, resulting in the formation of epinephrine from norepineph- rine. A number of metabolites are formed from the degradation of both norepinephrine and epinephrine. Catecholamine degradation proceeds independently, and in conjunction with monoamine oxidase, by cate- chol-O-methyltransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group donated by SAMe and, depending on the substrate, results in the formation of homovanillic acid, normetanephrine, and metanephrine. The formation of melatonin from l-tryptophan proceeds through 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and N-acetylserotonin. Melatonin is then formed in the pineal gland by the donation of a methyl group. 5-Methoxytryptamine, an alternate metabolite of serotonin, also requires the addition of a methyl group.

## Phosphatidylcholine

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a primary component of lecithin. It is the most frequently encountered phospholipid in animals and is structur- ally related to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. PC consists of a glycerol backbone that is esterified with fatty acids on car- bon atoms 1 and 2, with a phosphoric acid/choline complex in position 3. Although PC is usually referred to as if it were a single compound, it is actually a group of related compounds that vary depending on the fatty acid composition at positions C-1 and C-2. Dietary choline is derived primarily from PC, which, after absorp- tion by the intestinal mucosa, is metabolized to choline in the liver by the enzyme phospholipase D. Most choline is rephosphorylated to PC; however, a small amount is carried to the brain via the bloodstream, where it is converted to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. If PC or choline is lacking in the diet, it can be synthesized from phosphati- dylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine (see Fig. 134.5). Synthesis of PC depends on the availability of SAMe as a methyl donor because synthesis involves the transfer of methyl groups from three SAMe mol- ecules to phosphatidylethanolamine to generate one molecule of PC.

## 993CHAPTER 134 Homocysteine Metabolism

The metabolic pathways of PC, methionine, methylcobalamin, and 5-methylTHF are interrelated, intersecting at the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine by betaine (see Fig. 134.1). The use of choline molecules as methyl donors in this process is probably the main factor that determines how rapidly a diet deficient in choline induces pathological changes.25

## Taurine

Taurine is a unique amino acid because it carries a sulfonic acid group (−SO 3 H) instead of a carboxyl group (−CO 2 H). Taurine is biosynthe- sized from methionine or from cysteine via the transsulfuration path- way (see Fig. 134.6). Once cysteine is generated, it can be directed into several different pathways, including synthesis of GSH, acetyl CoA, 3 ′ -phosphate ′ -phosphosulfate (PAPS), and taurine. The committed first step in the degradation of homocysteine requires cystathionine synthase, P5P, and serine. P5P is also required as a cofactor in the cleav- age of cystathionine to cysteine. Homocystinuria, resulting from an absence of cystathionine synthase, can lead to mental retardation. Low levels of cystathionine synthase can also lead to abnormally high lev- els of homocysteine, especially when remethylation cofactors are also deficient.

## Phase II Detoxification

Because homocysteine is a critical intermediate in both methyl- and sulfur-group metabolism, elevated levels could indicate nutrient defi- ciencies that might compromise function in several of the hepatic Phase II detoxification reactions. Amino acid conjugation reactions require either glycine, glutamine, or taurine. Glycine functions in the conjugation of aromatic acids (e.g., benzoic acid to hippuric acid). Elevated levels of homocysteine might indicate reduced nutritional levels of betaine and subsequently its down-line metabolite, glycine. Taurine functions in acylations (e.g., bile conjugation). Sulfur conjugation requires NAC, GSH, PAPS, or methionine/ cysteine. NAC is used for mercapturic acid synthesis and is involved in detoxification of a wide variety of compounds, including aromatic hydrocarbons, some phenols, halides, esters, epoxides, and caffeine. GSH is involved in dismutation reactions of organic nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin). PAPS is used in sulfate ester synthesis, mostly with phe- nols, and some aliphatic alcohols (e.g., ethanol) and aromatic amines. Methionine and cysteine are used in cyanide-thiocyanate detoxifica- tion. A portion of the inorganic sulfur needed for the formation of all of these compounds passes through the homocysteine cycle. Alkylation reactions require SAMe, methylcobalamin, or 5-meth- ylTHF. These compounds provide methyl groups to detoxify com- pounds containing hydroxide, SH, or NH 2 groups. Examples of these reactions include norepinephrine to epinephrine, epinephrine to metanephrine, guanidoacetic acid to creatine, and N-acetylserotonin to melatonin. Other Phase II detoxification reactions that might be affected by elevated homocysteine as a biological marker of reduced nutrient for- mation include acetylation by acetyl-CoA, which requires cysteine as a source of its cysteamine component, and the use of carnitine for the conversion of valproic acid to valpropylcarnitine.

## Heart Disease

Increased blood levels of homocysteine are correlated with signifi- cantly increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD),48–54 myocardial infarction,55,56 peripheral occlusive disease,57–60 cerebral occlusive dis- ease,57,60 and retinal vascular occlusion (Box 134.1).61 Inborn errors of homocysteine metabolism result in high levels of homocysteine in the blood and severe atherosclerotic disease; even within the range considered normal (4–16 μ mol/L), there is a graded increase in risk for CAD. In a study of 304 patients with CAD ver- sus controls, the odds ratio for CAD increased as plasma homocyste- ine increased, even within the normal range. A μ mol/L increase in plasma homocysteine was correlated with an increase in the odds ratio of 2.4 (P < 0.001), with no “threshold effect.”51 A review of numerous studies found that mild hyperhomocyste- inemia after a methionine load test occurred in 21%, 24%, and 32% of patients with CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease, respectively.46 Another group of researchers found a 29.3% incidence of hyperhomocysteinemia (>14 μ mol/L by their defini- tion) in a group of 1160 elderly (ages 67–96 years) individuals in the Framingham Heart Study. The study also indicated that plasma homo- cysteine levels increased with age.57 A number of interrelated atherogenic mechanisms are thought to be involved with hyperhomocysteinemia. These include advanced thickening and smooth muscle cell proliferation of endothelial ves- sel wall intima, enhanced lipid deposition in the vessel wall, forced detachment of endothelial cells, activation of leukocytes and throm- bocytes, increased low-density lipoprotein oxidation, initiation of platelet thromboxane synthesis, enhanced oxidative stress induced by peroxide formation during homocysteine oxidation, and prothrom- botic coagulation interference.62,63 One way homocysteine assists this process is by the generation of hydrogen peroxide.64 By creating oxida- tive damage to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and endothelial cell membranes, hydrogen peroxide can then catalyze injury to vascular endothelium.64,65 Nitric oxide and other oxides of nitrogen released by endothelial cells (also known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor) protect endothelial cells from damage by reacting with homocysteine, forming S-nitrosohomocysteine, which inhibits hydrogen peroxide formation. However, as homocysteine levels increase, this protective mecha- nism can become overloaded, allowing damage to endothelial cells to occur.65–67 Because of the role of sulfate compounds in the formation of amino sugars needed to form the basement membrane of blood vessels, high levels of homocysteine are likely to contribute to the for- mation of blood vessels that are more susceptible to oxidative stress.67 The end result of the combination of oxidative damage and endothelial collagen instability can be the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Decreased plasma folate levels are correlated with increased lev- els of homocysteine, as well as a subsequent increased incidence of CAD. In a 15-year Canadian study of CAD mortality in 5056 men and women ages 35 to 79 years, lower serum folate levels were cor- related with a significantly increased risk of fatal CAD.68 In a cohort from the Framingham Heart Study, concentrations of folate and P5P were inversely correlated with homocysteine levels and the risk of

extracranial carotid artery stenosis.57 Low P5P and low vitamin B 12 have also been linked with hyperhomocysteinemia and a significantly increased risk of CAD.51 Another study of 160 cardiac transplanta- tion patients followed for an average of 28 days found that the high homocysteine levels seen in 99 of these patients surprisingly demon- strated no causal role in the atherothrombotic vascular complications of transplantation. Vitamin B 6 deficiency was seen in 21% of recipi- ents with, and in 9% without, cardiovascular complications or death, or both. Compared with patients with normal B 6 levels, there was a 2.7-fold increase in untoward cardiac events for those patients with B 6 levels less than or equal to 20 nmol/L.69 Remethylation of homocysteine and the subsequent formation of SAMe are critical for biosynthesis of l-carnitine, CoQ 10 , and creatine. Similarly, the transsulfuration pathway must be functioning properly for optimal biosynthesis of cysteine, GSH, pantethine, and taurine. All of these nutrients are used clinically to reduce oxidative stress, improve risk factor markers, or treat heart disease. Plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine is a more sensitive indicator of cardiovascular disease than plasma homocysteine.18

## Peripheral Vascular Disease

Elevated homocysteine levels have been established as an independent risk factor for intermittent claudication and deep vein thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine levels corresponded with an increased inci- dence of intermittent claudication and decreased serum folate levels in a study of 78 patients with intermittent claudication.70 A fourfold increase in the risk of peripheral vascular disease was noted in individ- uals with hyperhomocysteinemia compared with those with normal homocysteine levels.71 A group of researchers in the Netherlands found high homocysteine levels to be a significant risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, with a stronger relationship among women than men.72 An increased risk of peripheral vascular occlusion was noted in women taking oral contraceptives, which might be linked to the sig- nificantly increased homocysteine levels in women so affected. It is already known that oral contraceptives can cause declines or deficien- cies in vitamins B 6 , B 12 , and folate, nutrients integral to the processing of homocysteine. Laboratory assessment of plasma homocysteine lev- els may be helpful to detect women who may be predisposed to periph- eral vascular occlusion while on oral contraceptives.73

## Stroke

Stroke patients have significantly elevated homocysteine levels com- pared with age-matched controls,74 with a linear relationship between risk of stroke and homocysteine levels75 and a significant decrease in blood folate concentrations in those with elevated homocysteine.76 One investigation revealed that people with a dietary intake of at least 300 mcg/day of folic acid reduced their risk of stroke and heart disease by 20% and 13%, respectively, compared with those who consumed less than 136 mcg of folic acid per day.77

## Pregnancy

Biochemical enzyme defects and nutritional deficiencies can con- tribute to neural tube defects (NTDs), as well as other negative preg- nancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, placental abruption (infarct), preterm delivery, and low infant birth weight. Evidence has suggested that derangement of methionine-homocysteine metabolism could be the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis of NTDs and might be the mechanism of prevention observed with supplementa- tion of folic acid.78,79 It has been firmly established that a low dietary intake of folic acid increases the risk for delivery of a child with an NTD and that periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the occurrence of NTDs.80–86 Research also indicates that supplemental folic acid intake results in increased infant birth weight and improved Apgar scores, along with a concomitant decreased incidence of fetal growth retardation and maternal infections.87–90A derangement in methionine-homocysteine metabolism has also been correlated with recurrent miscarriage and placental infarcts (abruption).91 The amino acid homocysteine, when elevated, might be a terato- genic agent contributing to congenital defects of the heart and neural tube. Evidence from experimental animals lends support to this belief. When avian embryos were fed homocysteine to raise serum homocys- teine to over 150 nmol/mL, dysmorphogenesis of the heart and neural tube, as well as of the ventral wall, was observed.92 Because homocysteine metabolism, through the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways, affects several biochemical pathways involving the production of nutrients that are essential to the optimal functioning of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and nervous systems, it is not surprising that these other nutrients have been linked to com- plications of pregnancy in animal models and humans. Low plasma vitamin B 12 levels have been shown to be an independent risk factor for NTD.93,94 Methionine has been shown to reduce the incidence of NTD by 41% in an animal model when administered on days 8 and 9 of pregnancy.95,96 This evidence indicates that a disturbance in the remethylation pathway with a subsequent decrease in SAMe may be a contributing factor to these complications of pregnancy. PC, due to its role as a precursor to acetylcholine and choline, is acknowledged as a critical nutrient for brain and nerve development and function.97–99 Because the metabolic pathways of choline (via beta- ine), methionine, methylcobalamin, and 5-methylTHF are interrelated, intersecting at the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, a disturbance in the metabolism of either of these two methyl-donor path- ways, due to limited availability of key nutrients or decreased enzyme activity, directly affects the body’s ability to optimize levels of SAMe. Evidence suggests that women with a history of NTD-affected preg- nancies have altered folate metabolism.100–103 Patients with a severe congenital deficiency of the enzyme MTHFR, which is needed for the formation of 5-methylTHF, have reduced levels of both methionine and adenosylmethionine in their cerebrospinal fluid and show demy- elination in the brain and degeneration of the spinal cord.2,104 Because of its direct effect on the activation of folic acid to its methyl deriva- tive, a milder version of this enzyme defect is also strongly suspected to increase the incidence of NTDs.105 It is established that high vitamin A intake during the first 2 months of pregnancy is associated with a severalfold higher incidence of birth defects.106,107 Although the mechanism of action remains to be elicited, in an animal model, the activity of hepatic MTHFR was suppressed with high vitamin A levels, suggesting that its teratogenic effect during early pregnancy might be associated with a subsequent derangement in the remethylation of homocysteine.108 Because a more significant correlation has been found between high homocysteine levels in women experiencing placental abrup- tion, infarction, and spontaneous abortion than in control women, and homocysteine and CoQ 10 synthesis depend on the methi- onine-SAMe-homocysteine pathway, it is possible that low CoQ 10 and elevated homocysteine independently found in complicated pregnancy may also be found in related conditions.109,110 Nutritional intervention with the cofactors required for optimal metabolism of the methionine-homocysteine pathways offers a new integrated possibility for primary prevention of NTD and several other complications of pregnancy. Supplementation with betaine and the active forms of cobalamin and folic acid, such as methylcobalamin and folinic acid, along with riboflavin-5 ′ -phosphate (because of its role as a cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme), may play a significant role in reduc- ing or preventing these emotionally devastating outcomes.

## Neurological and Mental Disorders

In addition to the known effect of homocysteine on the cardiovas- cular system and micronutrient biochemical pathways, numerous diseases of the nervous system are correlated with high homocyste- ine levels and alterations in vitamin B 12 , folate, or vitamin B 6 metab- olism, including depression, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and cognitive decline in the elderly. Methylation reactions via SAMe, including methylation of DNA and myelin, are vitally important in the CNS. The neurological com- plications of vitamin B 12 deficiency are likely due to a reduction of activity of the vitamin B 12 -dependent enzyme methionine synthase and the subsequent reduction of SAMe production. The CNS lacks the alternate betaine pathway of homocysteine remethylation; therefore if methionine synthase is inactivated, the CNS has a greatly reduced methylation capacity.111 Other causes of reduced methionine syn- thase activity include folic acid deficiency and nitrous oxide anesthesia exposure.112 Homocysteine has also been found to be a neurotoxin, especially in conditions in which glycine levels are elevated, including head trauma, stroke, and vitamin B 12 deficiency.113 Homocysteine interacts with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, causing excessive calcium influx and free radical production, resulting in neurotoxicity.94 The neurotoxic effects of homocysteine or reduced methylation reactions, or both, in the CNS contribute to the mental symptomatology seen in vitamin B 12 and folate deficiency. Increased homocysteine levels can also be seen in schizophrenics.114 Significant deficiencies in vitamin B 12 and folate are common in the elderly population and can contribute to a decline in cognitive func- tion.115–117 An investigation of cognitive ability in older men (54–81 years old) found poorer spatial copying skills in those with higher homocysteine levels. Better memory performance was correlated with higher vitamin B 6 levels.118 Vitamin B 12 deficiency and increasing severity of cognitive impair- ment have been seen in patients with AD compared with controls and patients with other dementias.119 In a study of 52 AD patients, hospitalized nondemented controls, and 49 elderly subjects living at home, patients with AD were found to have the highest homocysteine levels and the highest methylmalonic acid (an indicator of vitamin B 12 deficiency) levels.120 In another Framingham study cohort with an average of 8 years’ follow-up, dementia developed in 111 of 1092 nondementia subjects, including 83 who were diagnosed with AD. The adjusted relative risk of dementia was 1.4 for each increase of 1 standard deviation in the logarithmically adjusted homocysteine value. The relative risk of AD was 1.8 per increase of 1 standard deviation at baseline and 1.6 per increase of 1 standard deviation 8 years before baseline. Additionally, in those with a plasma homocysteine level that was greater than μ mol/L, the risk of AD nearly doubled.121 In a study of 741 psychogeriatric patients, high plasma homo- cysteine levels were found in demented and nondemented patients; however, only demented patients also had lower blood folate concen- trations compared with controls. Patients with concomitant vascu- lar disease had significantly higher plasma homocysteine than those without diagnosed vascular disease. Significantly higher homocysteine levels, compared with controls, have also been found in Parkinson’s disease patients.122 Homocysteine’s effects on neurotransmitter metabolism, along with its potential reduction of methylation reactions, could be a con- tributing factor to the etiology of depression. Folate and vitamin B 12 deficiency can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, including dementia and depression. SAMe is used therapeutically as an antidepressant in Europe and was the third-most-popular antidepressant treatment in Italy in 1995.123,124 Long-term treatment of poststroke survivors with folic acid (2 mg), vitamin B 6 (25 mg), and vitamin B 12 (0.5 mg) was associated with a reduction in major depression in a 563-patient, ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.125 Methylation of myelin basic protein is vital to the maintenance of the myelin sheath. The worst-case scenario of folate and vitamin B 12 deficiency includes demyelination of the posterior and lateral col- umns of the spinal cord, a disease process called subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD).111 SCD can also be precipitated by nitrous oxide anesthesia, which causes an irreversible oxidation of the cobalt moiety of the vitamin B 12 molecule and the subsequent inhibition of methionine synthase activity, a decrease in homocys- teine remethylation, and decreased SAMe production.112 This has been treated using supplemental methionine, which further supports the theory of a nitrous oxide–induced biochemical block at methi- onine synthase.126 Particularly at risk for this condition are vitamin B 12 -deficient individuals who visit their dentist and receive nitrous oxide.112,127 Abnormal methylcobalamin metabolism is one of the proposed mechanisms for the pathophysiology of the demyelinating disease mul- tiple sclerosis (MS). Deficiency of vitamin B 12 has been linked to some cases of MS, and it has been suggested that dietary deficiency, or more likely, a defect in R-protein–mediated absorption or methylation of vita- min B 12 , might be a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of MS.128 Individuals with genetic variation in the 5,10-MTHFR gene are more susceptible to having a psychiatric disorder. The genetic varia- tion MTHFR C677T was significantly associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depressive disorder.129

## Diabetes Mellitus

Homocysteine levels appear to be lower in individuals with type 1 dia- betes mellitus. Forty-one subjects with type 1 diabetes (age 34.8 ± years; duration of illness: 10.7 ± 11.1 years) were compared with age-matched control subjects (age 34.2 ± 9.1 years). After an overnight fast, homocysteine was significantly lower (P = 0.0001) in the diabetic group (6.8 ± 2.2) than in the controls (9.5 ± 2.9). This difference was apparent in male and female subgroups.130 However, increased levels of homocysteine have been reported in type 1 diabetics with prolifera- tive retinopathy131 and nephropathy.131,132 Evidence to date suggests that the metabolism of homocysteine is impaired in patients with non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). After a methionine load, hyperhomocysteinemia occurred with significantly greater frequency in patients with NIDDM (39%) compared with age-matched controls (7%). The area under the curve over 24 hours, reflecting the total period of exposure to increased homocysteine, was also elevated with greater frequency in patients with NIDDM and macrovascular disease (33%) compared with con- trols (0%). The authors concluded that hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with macrovascular disease in a significant proportion of patients with NIDDM.133 Other researchers reported a correlation between increased homocysteine levels and the occurrence of macro- angiopathy in patients with NIDDM. Intramuscular injection of μ g methylcobalamin daily for 3 weeks reduced the elevated plasma lev- els of homocysteine in these individuals.134 Elevated homocysteine levels appear to be a risk factor for diabetic retinopathy in individuals with NIDDM. This might be due to a point

mutation on the gene for the enzyme MTHFR.135,136 A significantly higher percentage of diabetics with retinopathy exhibit this muta- tion.137 Elevated homocysteine levels cause cell injury to the small ves- sels, which may contribute to the development of retinopathy, as well as macroangiopathy in the cardiovascular system.135

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

Elevated total homocysteine levels have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Twenty-eight patients with RA and 20 healthy age-matched control subjects were assessed for homocysteine levels while fasting and in response to a methionine challenge. Fasting levels were 33% higher in RA patients than in con- trols. Four hours after the methionine challenge, the increase in plasma homocysteine concentration was also higher in patients with RA.137 Another study found statistically significant increases in homocysteine in RA patients (P = 0.003), with 20% of the patients having homocyste- ine levels above the reference range.138 A mechanism for this increased homocysteine in RA patients has not been elucidated. Penicillamine, a common sulfhydryl-containing arthritis treatment, has been found to lower elevated homocysteine levels in vivo.139

## Psoriasis

One study of 30 psoriasis patients and their matched controls were evaluated for blood concentrations of lipids, lipoproteins, acute- phase reactants, homocysteine, and atherothrombotic markers. This study observed that more than 50% of the patients with psoriasis had homocysteine levels that were higher than 15 mmol/L, whereas only 20% of the control individuals were above this cutoff point. It was concluded that the mean levels of serum homocysteine, fibrinogen, fibronectin, intercellular adhesion molecules, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and autoantibodies against oxidized low-density lipoprotein were increased in psoriatic patients, whereas tissue plasminogen factor, vitamin B 12 , and folate levels were decreased significantly.62 Further investigation into both the prevalence of hyperhomocys- teinemia and the mechanism of action affecting RA and psoriasis is necessary.

## Kidney Failure

Because homocysteine is cleared by the kidneys, chronic renal failure, as well as absolute or relative deficiencies of 5-methylTHF, methyl- cobalamin, P5P, or betaine, results in increased homocysteine levels. In 176 patients with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal or hemo- dialysis, homocysteine concentrations averaged 26.6 ± 1.5 μ mol/L in patients with renal failure compared with 10.1 ± 1.7 μ mol/L in normal subjects. Abnormal values exceeded the 95th percentile for normal controls in 149 of the patients with renal failure.140 Data also indicated that plasma homocysteine values represented an independent risk factor for vascular events in patients on peritoneal and hemodialysis. Patients with a homocysteine concentration in the upper two quin- tiles (>27.8 μ mol/L) had an independent odds ratio of 2.9 (confidence interval, 1.4–5.8; P = 0.007) of vascular complications. Vitamin B levels were also lower in patients with vascular complications than in those without such complications.141

## Alcoholism and Ethanol Ingestion

Chronic alcoholism is known to interfere with one-carbon metab- olism. Because of this, it is not surprising to find that mean serum homocysteine levels are two times higher in chronic alcoholics than in nondrinkers (P <0.001). Beer consumers have lower concentrations of homocysteine compared with drinkers of wine or spirits (P = 0.05). In chronic alcoholics, serum P5P and red blood cell folate concentrations have been shown to be significantly lower than in control subjects.13 Plasma homocysteine was significantly higher, compared with con- trols, in 42 active alcoholics hospitalized for detoxification. In another group of 16 alcoholics who abstained from ethanol ingestion, plasma homocysteine did not deviate from that of controls.14 Feeding ethanol to rats produces prompt inhibition of methionine synthase, as well as a subsequent increase in activity of betaine homo- cysteine methyltransferase. Despite the inhibition of methionine syn- thase, the enhanced betaine homocysteine methyltransferase pathway uses hepatic betaine pools to maintain levels of SAMe.142 Results indi- cate that ethanol feeding produces a significant loss in SAMe in the first week, with a return to normal SAMe levels in the second week. Betaine feeding enhances hepatic betaine pools in control animals, as well as ethanol-fed animals; attenuates the early loss of SAMe in ethanol-fed animals; produces an early increase in betaine homo- cysteine methyltransferase activity; and generates increased levels of SAMe in both control and ethanol-fed groups.143 It has been shown that minimal supplemental dietary betaine at the 0.5% level increases SAMe twofold in control animals and fivefold in ethanol-fed rats. Concomitant with the betaine-generated SAMe, ethanol-induced hepatic fatty infiltration was ameliorated.142 Betaine supplementation also reduces the accumulation of hepatic triglyceride produced after ethanol ingestion.143

Although homocysteine levels have been positively correlated with increased uric acid levels,2,144,145 no studies have investigated homo- cysteine levels in gout patients. It is possible the increased uric acid levels in gout are due to decreased SAMe production because of the reduction in homocysteine recycling. The excess adenosine, which reacts with methionine to form SAMe, is degraded to form uric acid as its end product. Niacin is contraindicated in gout because it competes with uric acid for excretion.146 Animal studies have shown that increased levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine, and thus homocysteine, cause significant reductions in SAMe-dependent methylation reactions.16 Therefore because degradation of the niacin-containing coenzyme nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide is dependent on methylation by SAMe, and SAMe activity is severely reduced in hyperhomocysteinemia, nia- cin levels might be higher in these people, resulting in less uric acid excretion, higher uric acid levels, and increased gout symptoms in sus- ceptible individuals. This possibility and its mechanism need further investigation.

## Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is a common presenting symptom in children with homocystinuria due to cystathionine synthase deficiency, as a result of an autosomal-recessive error of sulfur amino metabolism.147,148 Individuals with cystathionine synthase deficiency have decreased concentrations of cysteine and its disulfide form, cystine. Because of the role of sulfur compounds in the formation of sulfated amino sug- ars, disturbed cross-linking of collagen has been proposed as a possible mechanism of action. One group of researchers studying 10 patients with homocystinuria found normal synthesis of collagen but a signifi- cant reduction of cross-links.149 Because of the correlation between homocystinuria and osteo- porosis in children with this amino acidopathy and the increase in homocysteine concentrations in postmenopausal women, several authors have implied that elevated homocysteine levels contribute to postmenopausal osteoporosis. The Framingham study of 825 men and 1174 women, ranging from 59 to 91 years old, affirmed this sus- picion by evaluating plasma homocysteine levels and relative incident of hip fracture over a period of 16 to 19 years. The mean plasma total

homocysteine concentration was 13.4 ± 9.1 μ mol/L with 41 hip frac- tures among men and 12.1 ± 5.3 μ mol/L and 146 hip fractures among women. It was shown that both men and women in the highest quartile of plasma homocysteine had a greater risk of hip fracture than those in the lowest quartile, where the risk was almost 4 times as high for men and 1.9 times as high for women.150 Because physical activity is well known to lower homocysteine, as well as prevent falls, it may therefore influence the association between homocysteine levels and the risk of fracture.15 Therefore it seems prudent to prescribe exercise, as well as appropriate supplemental therapies, for women and men with high homocysteine and osteopenia/osteoporosis.

## Autism

Children with autism have higher levels of urinary homocysteine than children without autism, which may reflect nutritional deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B 6 , and vitamin B 12 .151 The increase in homo- cysteine concentration is significantly and directly correlated with the severity of deficit in communication skills but is unrelated to a deficit in socialization or repetitive/restricted behavior.152 In addition, autistic children have elevated levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and adenosine, whereas levels of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and the SAM/SAH ratio are significantly decreased compared with age-matched controls.153

## Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

There are studies that have shown an association between increased homocysteine levels and NAFLD.154–156 One study has determined increased homocysteine levels and increased prevalence of homozy- gote MTHFR 677C/T and MTHFR 1298A/C mutations in patients with NAFLD compared with healthy controls.157 A meta-analysis has shown that the T/T genotype of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and C/C genotype of MTHFR A1298C are more likely to be associated with the susceptibility to NAFLD.158 The increased homocysteine levels could possibly contribute to the development of NAFLD or be a result of impaired hepatic metabolism.159,160

## Drug-Induced Hyperhomocysteinemia

Because fibrate drugs are known to increase homocysteine levels (see “Pharmaceutic Drug Effects on Homocysteine”), one randomized, double-blind crossover study investigated the effect of using fenofi- brate adjunctively with 650 mcg of folic acid, 5 mg of vitamin B 6 , and 50 mcg of vitamin B 12 or just fenofibrate in men with hyperlipidemia. Subjects who received the fenofibrate plus placebo had an average increase in homocysteine concentration of 44%. Subsequent to the fenofibrate-plus-vitamin treatment, it was 13%. In this study, vitamins significantly prevented most of the homocysteine increase seen after fenofibrate plus placebo. The authors of this study suggested that rou- tine use of these nutrients might be beneficial with this pharmaceutical therapy.35


Many studies cited herein have used a reference range, with 12 to μ mol/L being the upper limit of normal for homocysteine. Researchers found a highly significant increase in relative risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and other disease processes as homocysteine levels increased, even within the “normal” range. Optimal levels of homocysteine and vitamin B 12 are needed to maintain the methylation cycle, along with adequate levels of vitamin B 6 to convert to cysteine, which is a precursor to form GSH. A number of clinical laboratories currently perform plasma homocysteine determinations, by them- selves or within a cardiovascular panel.


Although folic acid or folate supplementation (400 mcg/day) alone can reduce homocysteine levels in many subjects, given the importance of vitamins B 12 and B 6 to proper homocysteine metabolism, all three should be used together. In one study, the prevalence of suboptimal levels of these nutrients in men with elevated homocysteine levels was 56.8%, 59.1%, and 25% for folic acid, vitamin B 12 , and vitamin B 6 , respectively, indicating that folic acid supplementation alone would not lower homocysteine levels in many cases.161 In other words, folic acid supplementation will only lower homocysteine levels if there are adequate levels of vitamin B 12 and B 6 . This fact could reduce the effect of folic acid fortification of food. In 1998 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated the fortification of food products with folic acid. Although homocysteine levels have decreased modestly after the fortification of food with folic acid, the effect on mortality has been minor at best.22 This indicates the importance of more aggressive sup- plementary measures to reduce homocysteine-associated cardiovascu- lar risk. In one study of 100 men with hyperhomocysteinemia, oral therapy with 650 mcg folic acid, 400 mcg vitamin B 12 , 10 mg vitamin B 6 , or a combination of the three nutrients was given daily for 6 weeks. Plasma homocysteine was reduced by 41.7% during folate therapy and 14.8% during vitamin B 12 therapy, whereas 10 mg of vitamin B 6 did not reduce plasma homocysteine significantly. The combination worked synergistically to reduce homocysteine levels by 49.8%.162 Several studies using folic acid, vitamin B 6 , vitamin B 12 , and beta- ine, either alone or in combination, demonstrated the ability of these nutrients to normalize homocysteine levels.29,32,58,60,163,179 Other studies confirmed that oral folate supplementation alone would almost always lower high homocysteine, whereas B 6 and B 12 would lower homocyste- ine only in those with a genetic metabolic defect or dietary deficiency in those nutrients, or both.163,164 Some studies used high-dosage oral folate therapy (2.5–5 mg) to effectively reduce hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease, 50% of whom had abnormally high fasting plasma homocysteine levels, whereas 100% had abnormal plasma homocysteine after a methionine load. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of individual studies lowering homocysteine levels with folic acid and B vitamins, a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials of folic acid and vitamin B supplementation to lower homocysteine levels was found to have no significant effects within 5 years on cardiovascular events, cancer, or mortality.165 If a dietary deficiency or an increased demand resulting from genetic biochemical individuality exists for 5-methylTHF, methylcobalamin, P5P, or betaine, treatment with these active forms of micronutrients should reduce homocysteine levels better than the nonactive forms (e.g., folic acid, cyanocobalamin, pyridoxine, betaine hydrochloride). In addition, betaine is important when there is a deficiency of the P5P- dependent enzyme cystathionine synthase—the most common genetic abnormality affecting the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine breakdown. Betaine supplementation in combination with vitamin B 6 corrects the hyperhomocysteinemia in these individuals.28,163 There is speculation that the fortification of foods and supple- mentation of folic acid, the synthetic form of folate, have contributed increased risk of carcinogenesis.166 Although some studies have shown that moderate doses of folic acid reduce the risk of carcinogenesis, other studies suggest that larger doses or supplementation after a neoplastic lesion enhances the risk of carcinogenesis.167–171 The genetic variants in folate metabolism may also be a factor in the risk of colorectal carci- noma and adenoma. The homozygous C677T variant of methylenetet- rahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) may modify the association of folate status with risk of colorectal carcinoma and adenoma.172–174 Naturally occurring folates have a distinct metabolism that differs from folic acid.

## 998SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

Folic acid is inactive until it is metabolized into the natural reduced forms, including 5-methlytetrahydrofolate. There are studies that have demonstrated that the unmetabolized folic acid in the plasma reduces natural killer cell cytotoxicity in vitro.175,176 Elevated levels of plasma methylated folates (the sum of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and 4-alfa- hydroxy-5methyl-THF) are positively associated with increased risk of advanced or multiple colorectal adenomas. Therefore careful consider- ation should be given to the benefit and risk of folic acid and methylated folate supplementation.177 There are advantages to using 5-methylTHF over folic acid, such as the potential negative effects of unmetabolized folic acid in the peripheral circulation. In addition, using 5-methylTHF instead of folic acid overcomes metabolic defects caused by methy- lenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism, reduces interactions with drugs that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, and reduces the poten- tial for masking hematological symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency.

## 1000SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

• The upper chest and accessory breathing muscles should remain relaxed. • The expiratory phase is ideally effortless as the abdominal wall and lower intercostals relax downward and the diaphragm ascends back to its original domed position, aided by the elastic recoil of the lung. • A relaxed pause at the end of exhalation releases the diaphragm briefly from the negative and positive pressures exerted across it during breathing. • Under normal circumstances, individuals are quite unaware of their breathing. • Breathing rates and volumes increase or fluctuate in response to physical or emotional demands, but in normal subjects, they return to relaxed, low-chest patterns after the stimuli cease. Patients, especially those whose symptom presentation includes chronic fatigue or anxiety, or both, and who display or report a number of the following signs or symptoms, might be considered suitable candidates for respiratory treatment (see also “Diagnostic Considerations”).

## Benefits of Normal Respiratory Function

The exchange of gases involving the acquisition of oxygen (O 2 ) and elimination of CO 2 leads to enhanced cellular function and facilitates the following: • Normal performance of the brain, organs, and tissues of the body • Normal speech and human nonverbal expression (e.g., sighing) • Fluid movement (lymph, blood) • Spinal mobility through regular, mobilizing, thoracic cage movement • Digestive function via rhythmic positive and negative pressure fluc- tuations, via normal diaphragmatic function Any chronic alteration in breathing function automatically modi- fies these functions negatively. The effect of habitual BPDs, such as hyperventilation, on an indi- vidual’s physiology can be profound, potentially resulting in or exac- erbating a wide range of health problems, sometimes severely, ranging from anxiety and panic attacks to fatigue and chronic pain.

## The Carbon Dioxide–Oxygen Balancing Act

Chaitow et al.5 addressed the misconception that oxygen is “good” and carbon dioxide is “bad” by stating: Yet if one considers that life-giving oxygen can also be corrosive and toxic, and that a deficiency of the waste gas carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) can cause fainting, seizures, or death, then the “good/bad” distinction must be restated as “good within certain limits” and “bad within certain limits.” Maintaining these two gases within those limits is a complex task for the body, even more so because the supply of each gas fluctuates with each breath.

## Respiratory Homeostasis

Jennett6 described the delicate homeostatic balancing act in which pH and CO 2 are key features: When there are not other overriding drives affecting breathing, the neural control system acts to maintain a constant arterial Pco 2 . This must mean that the volume of CO 2 expired continually balances the volume produced by tissue metabolism. Measurements show that alveolar and arterial concentrations of CO 2 stay constant, which means that the volume of gas breathed out from the functional (alve- olar) volume of the lungs must vary precisely with the rate of meta- bolic CO 2 production. In rest and activity, when the system is left to itself, it is so efficient that the matching occurs virtually breath-by- breath, even when metabolic activity is continually changing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Patterns of Breathing

Hyperventilation can be an appropriate physiological response to the body’s metabolic needs; for example, tachypnea (rapid breathing) or hyperpnea (increase in respiratory rate proportional to increase in metabolism) may result as the respiratory centers respond automat- ically and appropriately to rising CO 2 production due to exercise or organic disease that may be creating acidosis. It is therefore important to exclude organic causes that diminish PaO 2 or elevate Paco 2 levels.7 Organic causes of HVS/BPDs that should be excluded and/or identified before breathing rehabilitation is initiated include the following: • Respiratory: asthma, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, pneu- monia, pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. • A case of carbon monoxide poisoning presenting as HVS has been reported.8 • Cardiovascular: acute and chronic left heart failure, right heart fail- ure, tachyarrhythmias • Hematopoietic: anemia • Renal: nephrotic syndrome, acute and chronic kidney failure • Endocrine: diabetes with ketoacidosis, pregnancy • Metabolic: liver failure • Pharmaceutic: aspirin, caffeine, amphetamine, nicotine, progester- one therapy BPDs may also emerge from a background of established pathol- ogy (e.g., asthma, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, chronic pain). Even tumor infiltrates into brain respiratory centers and central che- moreceptors have caused hyperventilation.9 Where this is the case, the aim of this chapter is not to explore these states because they are dis- cussed elsewhere in this textbook. Fluctuating blood glucose levels may trigger HVS/BPD symptoms in patients with high-carbohydrate diets, which produce rapid rises followed by sharp falls to fasting levels or below.7,10 Chaitow et al.5 noted that the following factors could lead to altered breathing patterns through pH shifts: • Ketoacidosis promotes deeper, faster breathing because the breath- ing centers respond to the higher CO 2 content. • Diarrhea results in the loss of alkaline plasma bicarbonate ions, which if prolonged, leads to acidosis. This stimulates corrective overbreathing to remove CO 2 (as carbonic acid [H 2 CO 3 ]) and nor- malizes the pH. • Excessive vomiting causes loss of hydrochloric acid, shifting the body toward alkalosis, slowing breathing to allow CO 2 to build up and restore pH. Hypoventilation is the result. • Use of steroids and diuretics can lead to alkalosis.

## Categorization of Causes

It is possible to place the common etiological features of HVS/BPD into biomechanical, biochemical, psychological, environmental, pathological, and habitual categories. The reasons for an individual breathing inappropriately can derive directly from structural, biomechanical causes, such as a restricted tho- racic spine, rib immobility, or shortness of key primary and accessory respiratory muscles. Causes of breathing dysfunction can also have a more biochemical etiology, possibly involving allergy or infection, which triggers narrow- ing of breathing passages and subsequent asthmatic-type responses. Acidosis, resulting from conditions such as kidney failure, also directly alters breathing function as the body attempts to reduce acid levels via elimination of CO 2 through hyperventilation.

## 1001CHAPTER 135 Hyperventilation Syndrome/Breathing Pattern Disorders

The link between psychological distress and breathing makes this another primary cause of many manifestations of dysfunctional respi- ration. Examining a person with anxiety or depression without breath- ing dysfunction being noted is difficult to imagine. Other catalysts that may affect breathing function include environ- mental factors (e.g., altitude, humidity).11 The etiology of HVS/BPD may involve combinations of the factors listed previously; however, in most instances, altered breathing pat- terns, whatever their origins, seem to be maintained by nothing more sinister than pure habit.7,12

## The Hydrogen Ion Factor

Chaitow et al.5 stated the following: The story [of HVS/BPD] might best begin with pH, because this factor influences every organ of the body. The variable of relative acidity facilitates many metabolic exchanges and it must be kept in careful balance. Since pH describes proportion of hydrogen ions available for combination, and the pH is on a log scale, a small change in pH, such as 7.4 to 7.2, means roughly a doubling of the number of hydrogen ions present. The binding of hydrogen to neg- ative sites helps to regulate enzymatic action, endocrine secretion, integrity of protein molecules, and cellular metabolism, including oxygen absorption and release. A pH of 7.2 would seriously com- promise many physiologic functions. The physiologic normal pH in the arterial blood is around 7.4, with an acceptable range from 7.35 to 7.45. Outside these limits lie ill effects of many kinds. The body will sacrifice many other things in order to maintain proper pH.

## The Carbon Dioxide–Hydrogen Ion Connection

• The acidity of the blood is determined mainly by CO 2 . • CO 2 is the end-product of aerobic metabolism, deriving mainly from the mitochondria. CO 2 is odorless, heavier than air, and, if inhaled in its pure form, causes suffocation. • CO 2 is present in the atmosphere at a concentration of around two-hundredths of 1% and is harmless to humans but adequate to sustain plant life. • Transportation of CO 2 occurs from the tissues into the blood and then to the lungs for exhalation. The body converts CO 2 to H 2 CO 3 , of which there is a perpetual surplus. • The lungs exhale around 12,000 mEq of H 2 CO 3 per day, compared with less than 100 mEq of fixed acids excreted by the kidneys. The normal range of end-tidal CO 2 pressure is 35 to 45 mm Hg.13 • Any increase in bodily activity produces CO 2 , acidifying the blood, unless more CO 2 is excreted and/or exhaled. • It is therefore obvious that changes in breathing volume relative to CO 2 production regulate the moment-to-moment concentration of pH of the bloodstream (longer-term regulation of pH is shared with the kidneys). • It is the concentration of CO 2 in the blood, not oxygen, that is the major regulator of breathing drive. • Higher CO 2 levels immediately stimulate more breathing, appar- ently on the assumption that abundance of CO 2 means oxygen-poor air is being breathed, breathing has stopped, or something else is happening that is an antecedent to suffocation.

## The Bicarbonate Buffer

Chaitow et al.5 explained the following: There exists a further balancing mechanism, the bicarbonate buffer. The bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 –) is derived from CO 2 during its ride in the bloodstream; CO 2 dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and (HCO 3 –). This bicarbonate reserve is adjustable as needed, up to a point, and constitutes a major alkaline buffer system which opposes rises in acidity. The kidneys regulate the regulators by adjusting the amount of bicarbonate returned to the bloodstream. If the kidneys detect excess acidity (a surplus of positively-charged hydrogen ions) they will try to retain more bicarbonate to balance the acid, but this is not a fast process; adjusting their filtration characteristics takes hours to days. In the short run, meanwhile, if bicarbonate buffering of excess acid is not sufficient, or if the bicarbonate is depleted, a faster back-up buffering system is available: hyperventilation. Exces- sive breathing exhales more CO 2 (acid), thereby bringing pH closer to normal.

## Oxygen Delivery and Smooth Muscle Constriction

The blood carries oxygen mainly in molecules of hemoglobin, which are contained in red blood cells. In an appropriate environment, hemoglobin combines readily with oxygen (to form oxyhemoglobin). This process var- ies according to local pH, as well as Po 2 . This ability to combine is import- ant for both absorbing oxygen through the alveoli and also for releasing oxygen through the capillary walls, where oxygen diffuses into the tissues. These two properties are largely determined by local conditions, so when pH is low (i.e., the blood is more acidic), hemoglobin in that area is stimulated to release additional oxygen. This is true of metabolically active tissues in general but especially of muscles. An exercising mus- cle needs all the oxygen it can get, and this is assisted by its chemical nature, explained by West as follows: An exercising muscle is acid, hypercarbic, and hot, and it benefits from increased unloading of oxygen from its capillaries.11 The effect of pH on oxyhemoglobin dissociation is called the Bohr effect. In the lungs, the need is to bind oxygen to hemoglobin, not release it. Not surprisingly, the lungs have a more alkaline environment. The fact that a shift of the blood toward acidity promotes dissocia- tion and release of oxygen from the hemoglobin is particularly import- ant when considering hyperventilation because the resulting alkalinity causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain more oxygen than usual. With increased alkalinity encouraging smooth muscle contraction and therefore diminished diameter of blood vessels, as well as the reluc- tance of hemoglobin to release its oxygen, a relative oxygen deficit is likely in tissues and the brain, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, aching, cramping, and cognitive problems.

## Psychology and Hyperventilation Syndrome/Breathing

<!-- chunk -->

## Pattern Disorders

On a psychological level, Bradley14 described a “cascade of symptoms” (Fig. 135.1) in which an original cause (emotional or physical) leads to tension and anxiety that result in hyperventilation, possibly an acute hyperventilation attack, which (with repetition), over time, results in anticipation, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors or phobias, or both. Chaitow et al. and others describe similar aspects of the influence of emotion on breathing5,15–17: Increased variability from breath to breath is known to correlate with anxiety states. Low Pco 2 and increased frequency of sighing are typical of those with panic disorder even when not panicking. These gener- alizations miss individuals who do not have a chronic BPD, but who do experience disrupted breathing under particular conditions. These “conditions” can provoke either an amygdala “alarm” discharge or some specific, learned breathing response, as well as occasional panic. Conway et al.18 used hypnosis to investigate the sources of hyper- ventilation episodes and found emotional events such as loss, sepa- ration, and impotent anger were common precipitating factors that

<!-- chunk -->

## 1002SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

began the hyperventilation trend. They concluded that hypnosis might be helpful in discovering the underlying cause of hyperventilation. Freeman et al.19 also showed that individuals who reported several symptoms indicating hyperventilation (including chest pain/palpitations and dizziness—not exclusively respiratory symptoms) displayed rather strong hyperventilation in response to recalling emotionally disturbing events, whereas the control subjects did not. Bereavement, loss of control, grief, and anger were common topics associated with the symptoms. Chaitow et al.5 concluded (Fig. 135.2): Aside from medical problems, there are still many factors in the psy- chological and behavioral realms competing for control of breathing. Successful regulation must take all factors into account, with special consideration for priorities of survival. The human brain adds a layer of complication with its power to imagine, project, and recall, often stimulating breathing reflexes without apparent reason.

## Symptoms

Acute hyperventilation represents approximately 1% of all cases of hyperventilation, which is well outnumbered by chronic hyperventi- lation.20 The symptoms and signs of HVS are extremely variable, and none is absolutely diagnostic. The following symptoms are indications of possible breathing pattern dysfunction: • A feeling of constriction in the chest • Shortness of breath • Accelerated or deepened breathing • Inability to breathe deeply • Feeling tense (the Nijmegen questionnaire avoids the use of the word anxiety) • Tightness around the mouth • Stiffness in the fingers or arms • Cold hands or feet • Tingling fingers • Bloated abdominal sensation • Dizzy spells • Blurred vision • Feeling of confusion or losing touch with environment Table 135.1 is not fully comprehensive but presents the most common symptoms and signs of HVS/BPD.

## Metabolic Disturbances and Hyperventilation Syndrome

• Two tests of nerve hyperexcitability produced by hypocapnia- induced hypocalcemia are Trousseau’s and Chvostek’s signs. • Chest pain associated with HVS/BPDs requires that heart disease is excluded as a diagnosis. Adrenaline-induced electrocardio- graphic changes can occur in hyperventilation, uncomplicated by coronary heart disease. One study suggested that up to 90% of noncardiac chest pain is thought to be induced by HVS/BPDs.23 In older patients, established coronary artery disease can be exacer- bated by vasoconstriction arising from hypocapnia, which puts them at risk of coronary occlusion and myocardial damage. Breathing in excess of metabolic requirements *all these symptoms are increased during progesterone phase of menstrual cycle Increased circulating histamines make allergic reaction more violent and possibly more likely • Dizziness, lightheadedness, "foggy brain" • Cold extremities • Chest pain • Anxiety, apprehension (sense of mild panic) • Depressed cortical activity • Vasomotor instability, blurring of consciousness and vision • Loss of cortical inhibition results in emotional lability 1. Upper fixator overactivity shortening of accessory breathing muscles 2. Painful nodules in nape of neck, anterior chest, and shoulder girdle 3. Temporal headaches 4. Painful legs 5. Whole body expresses tension—cannot relax in any position *Tetany, muscle spasm, paresthesia. Increased neuronal irritability. Reduced blood flow to brain, limbs, and heart *Increased neuronal activity, speeding spinal reflexes as well (initially) as heightened pain perception + photophobia, + hyperacusis *Sympathetic dominance— dilated pupils, dry mouth, sweaty palms, gut and digestive dysfunction, abdominal bloating, tachycardia Reduced PCO2 = respiratory alkalosis Fig. 135.1 Negative health influences of a dysfunctional breathing pattern such as hyperventilation.

## 1003CHAPTER 135 Hyperventilation Syndrome/Breathing Pattern Disorders

Alternatively, hyperventilation can trigger spasms of normal-caliber coronary arteries. • Rapid breathing or mouth breathing instigates aerophagia from air gulping, causing bloating, burping, and extreme epigastric dis- comfort. Irritable bowel syndrome is listed as a common symptom of chronic overbreathing. Fear and anxiety may induce abdomi- nal cramps and diarrhea.1 The median swallowing rate in healthy, nondyspeptic controls is three or four swallows per 15 minutes. In the absence of food, up to 5 mL of air accompanies saliva into the gastrointestinal tract with each swallow.24 • Hyperventilation leading to hypocapnia causes cerebral arterioles to constrict, increasing vascular resistance and reducing cerebral blood flow. This is a natural response to changes in CO 2 to regulate oxygen delivery to the brain.25

<!-- chunk -->

## Acute Hyperventilation Progression

• The patient presenting with an acute hyperventilation episode appears distressed. • The pattern of respiration is of deep, rapid breaths, using the acces- sory muscles visible in the neck and the upper chest. • Wheezing may be heard as a result of bronchospasm triggered by hypocapnia. • A stressful precipitating event is usually reported. • Hypocapnia reduces blood flow to the brain (2% decrease in flow per 1 mm Hg reduction in arterial CO 2 ), causing frightening central nervous system symptoms. The reduced oxygenation of brain and tissues of the body results from the contraction of smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels and a reluctance of the hemoglobin car- rier molecule to release oxygen in the increasingly alkaline environ- ment caused by excessive loss of CO 2 . • Poor concentration and memory lapses may occur as a result, with tunnel vision and onset in those susceptible to migraine-type head- aches or tinnitus. • Sympathetic dominance brings on tremors, sweating, clammy hands, palpitations, and autonomic instability of blood vessels, causing labile blood pressures.26 INPUT Need to vocalize Preparation for effort Sensing danger Relief, relaxation Freeze reaction Anxiety, emotion Chemoreceptors (O 2 , CO 2 , pH) OUTPUT Rate Depth Mouth vs. nose Abdomen vs. chest Breathe vs. pause Fig. 135.2 Final modulation of the breathing act includes input from many possible sources: the need for vocalization (a cry for help, a shouted warning, perhaps a growl), preparation for exertion, the need to freeze and become less noticeable, the need to maximize sensory acuity by keeping the body still, and the need to either remain calm or return to a baseline state of calmness. These inputs often conflict with each other, but if there is a hint of a threat to survival, they seem to have priority over all other considerations. (From Chai- tow L, Bradley D, Gilbert C. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Breathing Pattern Disorders. London: Churchill Livingstone; 2002: 122.)

## Chronic Hyperventilation

The diagnosis of chronic and intermittent hyperventilation is more difficult than acute hyperventilation. A careful history and systemic inquiry, checking all other symptoms in the other body systems, usually highlights a suspicious pattern, particularly to the experi- enced clinician who can think beyond his or her own specialist area. Examination must exclude organic diseases of the brain and nervous system; the heart, particularly angina and heart failure; respiratory dis- ease; and gastrointestinal conditions, especially if there are suspicious symptoms in these systems. Careful inquiries as to the precipitating causes of attacks help with both the diagnosis and focusing on the choice of treatment. Nixon22 suggested that there are often attacks where there is no preceding stressful event. For example, in chronic hyperventilators, the respira- tory center may have been reset to tolerate a lower than normal partial pressure of Paco 2 levels in the blood. In such patients, a single sigh or one deep breath may reduce the Paco 2 enough to trigger symptoms.

## Laboratory and Office Tests for Hyperventilation

<!-- chunk -->

## Syndrome/Breathing Pattern Disorders

Many possible tests for respiratory function exist. Some are difficult to perform (e.g., airway resistance), and some are invasive (e.g., blood gases).14 A selection of tests is as follows: • Preliminary tests should be conducted to exclude respiratory and cardiac disease, including peak expiratory flow rate, chest radio- graph, ECG, and an exercise ECG if chest pain is present. • Palpation and observation can demonstrate a paradoxical breath- ing pattern in which the abdomen retracts and the upper chest expands on inhalation (as opposed to normal abdominal protru- sion and lower thorax expansion). • The breath-holding time test does not require additional measure- ments or equipment. The time a hyperventilating patient can hold his or her breath is usually greatly reduced, often not beyond 10 to 12 seconds. Thirty seconds has been used as the approximate divid- ing line between hyperventilators and normals by some clinicians. It is worth noting that breathless patients without hyperventilation may have equal difficulty in breath holding.21 • A peak expiratory flow rate measurement, compared with age, sex, and height tables, provides a simply done, quick exclusion of signif- icant respiratory restriction in the clinic room. • If a hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT) is performed (during which the patient is asked to voluntarily overbreathe to bring on symptoms), ECG should be monitored (see “Caution” later). • Elevated erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (ECA) was recently (2009) suggested as a clinical marker for hyperventilation. The values of ECA were significantly elevated ( ∼ 31 U/g hemoglo- bin) in patients who hyperventilated compared with controls (24.7 U/g hemoglobin). However, hyperventilation sensitiv- ity and specificity were only 52.1% and 76.7%, respectively. There are other conditions that might elevate ECA, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and different anemias (aplastic, iron deficiency, autoimmune hemolytic, β -thalassemia).28 • Arterial blood gas determination is invasive and painful (arterial puncture) but appropriate in the emergency department, where the diagnosis of acute hyperventilation is required. For patients in whom chronic hyperventilation is suspected, the pressure of end- tidal carbon dioxide (PET CO 2 ) can be measured noninvasively from a continuous sampling through nasal prongs or cannula with the mouth occluded, or the tube can be sited in an oral airway for those with nasal obstruction to monitor CO 2 deficits. The PET CO 2 is the level of CO 2 released at the end of expiration. • Capnography: PET CO 2 can be evaluated after a 4-minute quiet breathing rest period, followed by exercise and recovery, or a HVPT can be conducted in the recovery period. Most patients with chronic hyperventilation have a PET CO 2 at or below mm Hg and a markedly delayed recovery from hypocapnia after overbreathing, sometimes lasting 30 minutes after testing.29,30 By measuring PET CO 2 or transcutaneous CO 2 levels while a hyper- ventilation-provoking activity is performed, a potential link can be made between symptoms and CO 2 levels.31 • The think test32 may be initiated 3 to 4 minutes into the recovery period. The patient is asked to recall a painful emotional experience during which symptoms developed. If the PET CO 2 drops 10 mm Hg, the test supports hyperventilation. Bradley14 noted: “In some patients with hyperventilation the Paco 2 and the PET CO 2 may be in the normal range. In those who are asymptomatic at the time of testing, this finding could be accepted. However, a normal level while experiencing symptoms negates hypocapnia as the cause of symptoms. It prompts a search for an alternative explanation.” • Buteyko performed comparative studies with a simple breath-hold- ing technique to test CO 2 levels and found that a simple technique of breath holding after expiration could predict the percent of alve- olar CO 2 and therefore the degree of hyperventilation to a high degree of accuracy. According to his calculations, optimal levels of alveolar Pco 2 correlated with postexpiratory breath-holding time of 40 to 60 seconds. Many asthmatics and hyperventilators are found to be able to hold the breath out for less than 10 seconds.33–35

## Caution

Bradley14 cautioned the following: The hyperventilation provocation test is best done before explana- tions of symptoms, to prevent suggestion and bias. Patients need to be warned only of a dry mouth. The patient is asked to concentrate on how they feel during the 1-2 minute period when they are over breathing at the rate of 30-40 per minute. The rate is set by the examiner’s hand movements. The operator must stress the impor- tance of the test and the need to continue for as long as they can. An arterial blood gas determination at the end of the test can be of use to establish the depth of hypocapnia. Some clinicians rely on as little as 12 deep breaths which the patient can recover from easily, and sub- jective symptoms produced are recorded. In both the breath hold- ing and voluntary over-breathing tests, the skills of the clinician are important for maintaining the trust and co-operation of patients.

## The Nijmegen Questionnaire

Bradley14 pointed out that no “gold standard” exists for chronic HVS, but the Nijmegen Questionnaire is noninvasive, with a high level of sensitivity (up to 91%)36 and specificity (up to 95%).37 It is also a way to monitor the progress of treatment by reevaluating symptoms. Bradley noted that the results of this simple test also helped indicate whether the initiating trigger causing the HVS/BPDs resolved, suggest- ing that the patient had to deal with only the “bad breathing” habit and musculoskeletal and motor pattern changes, or whether the initiating

<!-- chunk -->

## 1005CHAPTER 135 Hyperventilation Syndrome/Breathing Pattern Disorders

triggers were ongoing or unresolved and might need further cognitive help (Fig. 135.3). Warburton and Jack30 stated that the Nijmegen Questionnaire was neither sensitive nor specific for chronic idiopathic hyperventilation without physiological testing, because many of the symptoms on the questionnaire are common to an organic respiratory disease.

# BIOMECHANICAL (STRUCTURAL)

# CONSIDERATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

## The Structure–Function Continuum

Nowhere in the body is the axiom of structure governing function more apparent than in its relation to respiration. Just as prolonged changes in patterns of use, such as an inappropriate (hyperventilation) breathing pat- tern, induce structural changes involving the muscles and joints (e.g., rib) of respiration, so do these changes ultimately prevent normal function. Ultimately, the self-perpetuating cycle of functional change cre- ating a structural modification, leading to reinforced functional ten- dencies, can become complete, from whichever direction dysfunction derives. Examples follow: • Structural adaptations can prevent normal breathing function. • Abnormal breathing function ensures continued structural adapta- tional stresses.38 The restoration of normal function demands the restoration of adequate structural mobility, whereas maintenance of restored biome- chanical flexibility requires that function (how the individual breathes) should be normalized through reeducation and training. Individually, neither approach is as useful as a combination of resto- ration of structural integrity, combined with functional improvement. It should be obvious that other underlying etiological features, whether these relate to psychosocial, biochemical, or biomechanical factors, should be addressed as far as possible as a prerequisite of rehabilitation.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Muscles of Breathing

The muscles associated with breathing function can be grouped as either inspiratory or expiratory. They are either primary in that capac- ity or provide accessory support. Because expiration is primarily an elastic response of the lungs, pleura, and “torsion rod” elements of the ribs, all muscles of expi- ration could be considered accessory muscles because they are recruited only during increased demand. They include internal intercostals, abdominal muscles, transverse thoracis, and subcos- tales. With increased demand, the iliocostalis lumborum, quadra- tus lumborum, serratus posterior inferior, and latissimus dorsi may support expiration, including during the high demands of speech, coughing, sneezing, singing, and other special functions associated with breathing. Space does not permit in-depth discussion of the muscles of respi- ration, further details of which can be found in Chaitow et al.5

## Neural Regulation of Breathing

Respiratory centers in the brainstem unconsciously influence and adjust alveolar ventilation to maintain arterial blood oxygen and CO 2 pressures at relatively constant levels to sustain life under varying con- ditions and requirements.5 The three main groups are as follows: • The dorsal respiratory group, located in the distal portion of the medulla, receives input from peripheral chemoreceptors and other types of receptors via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. These impulses generate inspiratory movements and are responsible for the basic rhythm of breathing. • The pneumotaxic center in the superior part of the pons transmits inhibitory signals to the dorsal respiratory center, controlling the filling phase of breathing. Fig. 135.3 Nijmegen questionnaire. (From Chaitow L, Bradley D, Gilbert C. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Breathing Pattern Disorders. London: Churchill Livingstone; 2002: 176.)

<!-- chunk -->

## 1006SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

• The ventral respiratory group, located in the medulla, causes either inspiration or expiration. It is inactive in quiet breathing but is important in stimulating abdominal expiratory muscles during lev- els of high respiratory demand. The Hering–Breuer reflex prevents overinflation of the lungs and is initiated by nerve receptors in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles, sending messages to the dorsal respiratory center, via the vagus nerve. The reflex “switches off” excessive inflation during inspiration, as well as excessive deflation during exhalation. The autonomic nervous system enables the automatic, unconscious maintenance of the internal environment of the body in ideal efficiency and adjusts to the various demands of the external environment, be it sleep with repair and growth, quiet or extreme physical activity, or stress (Fig. 135.4). A “third” nervous system regulating the airways has been recog- nized, called the nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) system. Containing inhibitory and stimulatory fibers, nitric oxide has been identified as the NANC neurotransmitter.39 • NANC inhibitory nerves cause calcium ions to enter the neuron, mediating smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. • NANC stimulatory fibers—also called C-fibers—are found in the lung supporting tissue, airways, and pulmonary blood vessels, and appear to be involved in bronchoconstriction after exercise- induced asthma.40

## Chemical Control of Breathing

The central role of respiration is to maintain balanced concentrations of oxygen and CO 2 in the tissues. Increased levels of CO 2 act on the central chemosensitive areas of the respiratory centers themselves, increasing inspiratory and expiratory signals to the respiratory muscles. In contrast, oxygen acts on peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid body (in the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries) via the glossopharyngeal nerves and the aortic body (on the aortic arch), which sends the appro- priate messages via the vagus nerves to the dorsal respiratory center.

<!-- chunk -->

## Voluntary Control of Breathing

Automatic breathing can be overridden by higher cortical conscious input (directly via the spinal neurons, which drive the respiratory muscles) in response to, for instance, fear or sudden surprise. Speaking requires voluntary control to interrupt the normal rhythmicity of breathing, as do singing and wind instrument playing. Evidence indi- cates that the cerebral cortex and thalamus also supply part of the drive for normal respiratory rhythm during wakefulness. (Cerebral influ- ences on the medullary centers are withdrawn during sleep.) Habitual BPDs and HVS probably originate from some of these higher centers.7

## Syndrome/Breathing Pattern Disorders

Different models of care in managing HVS/BPDs are available. It is assumed that all organic causes of breathing pattern changes have been excluded and that coexisting problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic pain, and hormonal imbal- ances receive appropriate specialized attention. It is also assumed that manual therapy approaches would be incorporated as an essential ele- ment of rehabilitation.

Bradley’s14,41 physical therapy rehabilitation follows stages that are summarized in the acronym BETTER: breathing retraining, esteem/ self-image, total body relaxation, talk/breath control, exercise pre- scription, rest/sleep. Breathing retraining incorporates a number of elements: • Awareness of faulty breathing patterns • Relaxation of the upper chest, shoulders, and accessory muscles • Abdominal/low-chest breathing pattern retraining • Awareness of normal breathing rates and rhythms both at rest and during activity The elements of the physical therapy protocol involving relaxation, exercise, talk/breath control, and sleep are all individualized and are not described here.

## Hyperventilation Syndrome/Breathing Pattern Disorders

• Initial (and continual or periodic) assessment of breathing function based on functional evidence and palpation determines what needs to be done to improve breathing function. • Education and information are vital for creating motivation and awareness as to why homework is essential in normalizing BPDs. • The patient must understand clearly that the practitioner or thera- pist can do no more than create an environment, a possibility, for the restoration of more normal function, but the breathing work itself is up to the patient. • Treatment of muscles and joints alone, no matter how appropriate, can never restore normal breathing patterns without cooperative effort. • Conversely, breathing retraining without the freeing of restricted structures is far more difficult to achieve. • Psychotherapy and counseling are also unlikely to be successful unless retraining is introduced and structural factors are dealt with. • Manual attention to the upper fixators and/or accessory breathing muscles (upper trapezii, levator scapulae, scalenes, sternocleido- mastoid, pectorals, and latissimus dorsi) is usually required. • The diaphragm area also requires direct attention as a rule (lower anterior intercostals, sternum, costal margin, beneath costal margin, abdominal attachments, quadratus lumborum, and psoas). • Active trigger points in these muscles may need deactivating manu- ally or via acupuncture. • Acupuncture being administered for 30 minutes, twice weekly, for 4 weeks showed a reduction in Nijmegen score from 31 to 24. The focus was on reducing anxiety, thereby reducing hyperventilation. The points used were colon 4, liver 3, and stomach 36 bilaterally.42 • The thoracic spine and ribs may require mobilization (osteopathic or chiropractic adjustments). • Osteopathic lymphatic pump methods may be required if there is evidence of stasis. • Retraining: various breathing exercises should be introduced, individualized to the specific needs of the patient, commonly on the basis of pursed-lip breathing and pranayama yoga methods (Box 135.1).43–47 • Relaxation methods, including autogenic training or progres- sive muscular relaxation, or both, might usefully be introduced. One small placebo-controlled trial showed improvement on anxiety and hyperventilation in HIV-infected patients after four Swedish massage sessions (once weekly for 30 minutes to the back).48 • Sleep pattern disturbances might require attention. • Exercise of aerobic nature should be carefully introduced. • Dietary advice and counseling should be introduced as appropriate.

## Breathing Rehabilitation Exercises

Box 135.1 describes three breathing rehabilitation exercises. Chronic HVS/BPDs are commonly successfully treated. However, a time frame of 12 to 26 weeks may be required, with active patient participation throughout to break well-established habits. Lum1 reported that more than 1000 anxious and phobic patients were treated using breathing retraining, physical therapy, and relax- ation. The results indicated the following:

## 1008SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

• Symptoms were usually abolished in 1 to 6 months, with some younger patients requiring only a few weeks. • At 12 months, 75% were free of all symptoms, 20% had only mild symptoms, and about 1 in 20 patients had intractable symptoms. Breathing rehabilitation therapy was evaluated in patients with HVS; the diagnosis was based on the presence of several stress-related complaints and reproduced by voluntary hyperventilation.49 Patients with organic diseases were excluded, and most patients met the criteria for an anxiety disorder. Therapy was conducted in the following sequence: • Brief, voluntary hyperventilation to reproduce the reported com- plaints • Reattribution of the cause of the symptoms to hyperventilation • Explaining the rationale of therapy involving a reduction of hyper- ventilation by acquiring an abdominal breathing pattern, with slowing down of expiration • Breathing retraining for 2 to 3 months working with a physiothera- pist After breathing therapy, the sum scores of the Nijmegen Questionnaire were markedly reduced. A canonical correlation analysis relating the changes of the various complaints to the modifications of breathing variables showed that the improvement of the complaints was correlated mainly with the slowing down of breathing frequency.

# SUMMARY

HVS/BPDs are a common disorder affecting up to 10% of patients in a general internal medicine practice. However, it is rarely recognized or appropriately treated. Breathing retraining is effective clinically and economically, as long as enough patience is exercised to actively engage the patient in a program requiring weeks to months of behavioral change. Acupuncture was also shown to improve symptoms of HVS, especially with anxiety as the etiology.

## 1010SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

Many clinical and experimental studies have clearly demonstrated that stress, personality, attitude, and emotion are etiological or con- tributory in suppressing the immune system as well as leading to the development of many diseases.1 Reaction to stressful stimuli is entirely individual, reinforcing the fact that people differ significantly in their perceptions of and responses to various life events. The variations in response help account for the wide diversity of stress-induced illnesses. Stress-induced increases in corticosteroid and catecholamine levels lead to an immunosuppressed state, leaving the host susceptible to infectious and carcinogenic illnesses. This immunosuppression is pro- portional to the level of stress, and although the effects are numerous, they appear to involve a common mechanism: an increase in gluco- corticoids, proinflammatory cytokines, and catecholamines resulting in significant alterations in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic-adrenal medullary axes, leukocyte function, thy- mic involution, and suppressed lymphopoiesis. More than 150 clinical studies have shown that stress can alter immune function and contrib- ute to the development of significant disease and poor health.1–3 Lymphocytes, monocytes or macrophages, and granulocytes have receptor sites for the many regulating hormones and neurotransmit- ters of the HPA and sympathetic-adrenal medullary axes. Alterations in these compounds lead to disruption of cellular trafficking, prolifer- ation, cytokine secretion, antibody production, and cytolytic activity. For example, glucocorticoids inhibit the production of IL-12, IFN- γ , IFN- α , and TNF- α by antigen-presenting cells and Th1 cells, but upregulate the production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This mechanism systemically causes a selective suppression of the Th1–cel- lular immunity axis and a shift toward Th2-mediated humoral immu- nity, rather than generalized immunosuppression. During an immune response and inflammation, the activation of the stress system, and thus increased levels of systemic glucocorticoids through induction of a Th2 shift, may protect the organism from systemic “overshooting” with Th1 proinflammatory cytokines and other products of activated macrophages with tissue-damaging potential. However, conditions associated with significant changes of glucocorticoids, such as acute or chronic stress or cessation of chronic stress, severe exercise, preg- nancy, and the postpartum state, through modulation of the Th1–Th2 balance, may affect the susceptibility to or the course of infections as well as autoimmune and atopic and/or allergic diseases.4,5 A study in medical students taking examinations found that psychological stress produced a shift in the cytokine balance toward a Th2 profile.6 The data showed decreased synthesis of Th1 cytokines, including IFN- γ , and increased production of Th2 cytokines, including IL-10. Therefore a stress-induced decrease of Th1 cytokines results in dysregulation of cell-mediated immune responses. To help demonstrate causal relations between psychosocial stressors and the development of infectious illness under well-controlled condi- tions, investigators inoculated subjects with several different types of vaccines to demonstrate clinically relevant alterations in the immu- nological response to challenge. The chronic stress associated with caring for a spouse with Alzheimer’s disease or, for younger people, experiencing stressful life events was associated with a poorer antibody response to an influenza virus vaccine than in well-matched control subjects.7,8 The premise was that the production of a delayed, weaker, and shorter-lived immune response to a vaccine would be analogous to impaired immune responses to other pathogens. Consistent with this concept, subjects who showed poorer responses to vaccines also expe- rienced higher rates of clinical illness as well as longer-lasting infec- tious episodes. Healthy infants with a higher cortisol response to pain were shown to have differences in T-cell concentrations and a lower Fig. 136.1 General scheme of differentiation of T-helper cells. Naive CD4+ T cells, after activation by T-cell receptor and costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and inducible T-cell costimulatory (ICOS), can differen- tiate into four effector T-helper cells: Th1, Th2, Th3, or Th17 cells. These cells produce different cytokines, which have specialized immunoregulatory functions. Interferon (IFN) produced by Th1 cells is important in the regulation of antigen presentation and cellular immunity. Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 produced by Th2 cells regulate B-cell responses, important mediators of allergic diseases. Transforming growth factor (TGF) and IL-10 are produced by Th3 cells to regulate Th1 and Th2 cells. Th17 cells regulate inflamma- tory responses by expressing IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-26. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) protocols can be implemented to reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, thereby inhibiting the conversion of activated T cells into pathogenic Th17 cells.

delayed-type hypersensitivity to vaccination, with sex differences in the immune system seen as early as 6 weeks of age.9 Fortunately, the effects of stress on the immune system can be atten- uated or even overcome with positive mood, effective stress reduction techniques, humor, laughter, and guided imagery.1,10

# ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS AND IMMUNE

# FUNCTION

Toxic compounds exert several different effects, usually simultane- ously, that cause complex dysfunction to the immune system. Toxins often deplete the glutathione (GSH) content in APCs, thereby affecting whether these cells will be Th1 or Th2 dominant.11 Low GSH levels lead to an increase in Th2 dominance, whereas higher GSH levels pro- mote Th1 immune response.12 Many immune-toxic pollutants reduce glutathione levels, including mercury, lead, perfluorocarbons, phthal- ates, solvents, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides, organophosphate pesticides, particulate matter, tobacco smoke, and diesel exhaust particles (Fig. 136.2).13 A diminished Th1 response will reduce the ability to respond to bacterial, viral, and fungal invasion, typically resulting in chronic infections. In an animal model, the consumption of PCB containing fat resulted in diminished mitogen response, decreased phagocytosis, diminished numbers of CD8+ cells, and thymic atrophy.14–16 Mobile home dwellers exposed to formaldehyde were found to have lower T and B cells and diminished mitogen response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA).17 Mold exposure has also been shown to reduce mitogen responsiveness in humans.18

# LIFESTYLE EFFECTS ON IMMUNE FUNCTION

A healthy lifestyle goes a long way in establishing a healthy immune sys- tem. This benefit is perhaps most obvious when one looks at the effects of lifestyle on natural killer cell activity.19–21 Box 136.1 lists the lifestyle prac- tices associated with higher natural killer cell activity. One lifestyle factor that is critical to healthy immune function is adequate sleep. In healthy humans, sleep deprivation has consistently been demonstrated to impair different parameters of immune function and mood. Interestingly, the deterioration of immune function precedes the plummeting of subjective well-being and psychosocial performance in sleep-deprived subjects.22

# NUTRITIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING IMMUNE

# FUNCTION

The health of the immune system is greatly affected by a person’s nutri- tional status. Dietary factors that depress immune function include nutrient deficiency, excess consumption of sugar, consumption of allergenic foods, and high cholesterol levels in the blood. Dietary fac- tors that enhance immune function include all essential nutrients, antioxidants, carotenes, and flavonoids. Consistent with good health, optimal immune function requires a healthy diet that has the following characteristics: Antigen ThO Allergic reactivity Plasma cells Killer T cells Mast cells Cell-mediated immunity Chronic infection lgG2algG1, lgE Autoimmunity IL-4, 5, 6, IL-2 IFN-(cid:31) APC Th1 B-cell Eosinophils Th2Toxicants that deplete GSH and boost Th2 DEP Tobacco smoke PFOS Phthalates Triclosan TCE Xylene Toluene Lead Mercury Pesticides Fig. 136.2 Many immune-toxic pollutants reduce glutathione levels leading to immune system dysregulation increasing the risk for infections, allergies, autoimmunity, and cancer.

• Is rich in whole, natural foods, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, seeds, and nuts • Is low in fats and refined sugars • Contains adequate, but not excessive, amounts of protein In addition, individuals are encouraged to drink five or six 8-ounce glasses of water (preferably pure) per day. These dietary recommen- dations, along with a positive mental attitude, a good high-potency multivitamin and mineral supplement, a regular exercise program, deep-breathing and relaxation exercises (meditation, prayer, etc.), and at least 7 hours of sleep daily, will go a long way in helping the immune system function at an optimum level.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrient Deficiency

Nutrient deficiency is the most common cause of a depressed immune system. Although research relating nutritional status to immune function has historically concerned itself with severe malnutrition states (i.e., kwashiorkor and marasmus), attention is shifting toward marginal deficiencies of single or multiple nutrients and the effects of overnutrition. The plethora of clinical and experimental data has concluded that a single nutrient deficiency can profoundly impair the immune system. Given the widespread problem of subclinical nutrient deficiency in Americans, it is likely that many have impaired immunity amenable to nutritional supplementation. This statement is particularly true in the elderly. Numerous studies have shown that most elderly Americans are deficient in at least one nutrient, and studies show that taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement enhances immune function in elderly subjects (whether they have an overt nutritional deficiency or not).23–25 These findings have considerable fundamental, clinical, and public health significance.

## Protein

The importance of adequate protein intake to proper immune function has been extensively studied.10 Although all facets of immune function are ultimately affected, the most severe effects of protein–calorie mal- nutrition (PCM) are on cell-mediated immunity. PCM is associated with multiple nutrient deficiencies, and some immune dysfunctions attributed to PCM are likely the result of these deficits. Partial defi- ciencies of dietary vitamins produce a comparatively greater depres- sion in the natural and inducible levels of cytotoxic activities than do partial protein deficiencies. Nonetheless, adequate protein is essential for optimal immune function.

## Sugar

The oral administration of 100-g portions of carbohydrate as glucose, fructose, sucrose, honey, or orange juice significantly reduces neutro- phil phagocytosis, but starch has no effect. As can be seen in Fig. 136.3, effects start within 30 minutes, last for more than 5 hours, and typically show a 50% reduction in phagocytic activity at the peak of inhibition (usually 2 hours after ingestion).26,27 Because polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) constitute 60% to 70% of the total white blood cells (WBCs) and are a major portion of the defense mechanism, impairment of phagocytic activity leads to an immune-compromised state. Oral administration of increasing amounts of glucose progres- sively lowers neutrophil phagocytosis, with maximal inhibition corre- sponding to maximal blood glucose levels. In addition, oral ingestion of 75 g of glucose has been shown to depress lymphocyte response to mitogens, apparently through the ele- vation of insulin levels.28 Other parameters of immune function are also undoubtedly affected by sugar consumption. It has been hypothesized that the ill effects of high glucose levels result from the elevation of insulin values and competition with vita- min C for membrane transport sites.29,30 This hypothesis is based on evidence that vitamin C and glucose appear to have opposite effects on immunological function and the fact that both substances require insulin for membrane transport into many tissues. Considering that the average American consumes 125 g of sucrose, plus 50 g of other refined simple sugars each day, the conclusion that most Americans have chronically depressed immune systems is ines- capable. It is clear, particularly during an infection, that the consump- tion of simple sugars, even in the form of fruit juice, is deleterious to the host’s immune status. Short-term fasting could be encouraged, particularly during the first 24 to 48 hours of an acute infectious illness, because it results in a significant (up to 50%) increase in phagocytic index.26 The fast should not be continued for a long period; over time, the leukocytes’ energy sources will become depleted.

## Obesity

Obesity is associated with decreased immune status, as evidenced by reduced bactericidal activity of leukocytes, and higher morbidity and mortality from infections as well as from certain cancers in obese individ- uals.31 Obesity also increases the risk of asthma, atopic, and autoimmune diseases by inducing decreased immunological tolerance as a conse- quence of immunological changes induced by adipokines (e.g., leptin and adiponectin) and cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF- α ) secreted by white adi- pose tissue.32 In addition, cholesterol and lipid values are usually elevated in obese individuals, which contribute to impaired immune function.

## Blood Lipids

Increased blood levels of cholesterol, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and bile acids inhibit various immune functions, including the following33,34: • Lymphoproliferation • Response to mitogens • Antibody response • PMN chemotaxis • Phagocytosis 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 012345 Hours N e u t r o p hi l A c ti vi t y

## 1013CHAPTER 136 Immune System Support

Therefore optimal immune function depends on control of these serum components. Interestingly, l-carnitine, even at minimal concen- trations, has been shown to neutralize lipid-induced immunosuppres- sion.35 This effect is probably due to carnitine’s role as a rate-limiting factor in the removal of fat emulsion from the blood.36

## Alcohol

Alcohol increases the susceptibility to experimental infections in ani- mals, and alcoholics are known to be more susceptible to infections, especially pneumonia. Studies of immune function in alcoholism showed a profound depression in most parameters of immunity.37

## Vitamins

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin A and Carotenes

Vitamin A plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity and secretions of the epithelial and mucosal surfaces. These systems con- stitute a primary nonspecific host defense mechanism. Vitamin A has been shown to stimulate and/or enhance numerous immune pro- cesses, including the following: • Induction of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumors • Natural killer cell activity • Lymphocyte blastogenesis • Mononuclear phagocytosis • Antibody response These effects are not simply the result of the reversal of vitamin A deficiency because many of them are further enhanced by the admin- istration of (supposedly) excessive levels of vitamin A.25,38 In addition, vitamin A prevents and reverses stress-induced thymic involution, and additional vitamin A can promote thymus growth.39 Carotenes have also demonstrated several immune-enhanc- ing effects. In addition to being converted into vitamin A, carotenes function as antioxidants. Because the thymus gland is susceptible to damage by free radicals, β -carotene may be more advantageous in enhancing the immune system than retinol. For more information, see Chapter 125.

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) plays an important role in the natu- ral approach to immune enhancement. Although vitamin C has been shown to be antiviral and antibacterial, its main effect is via improvement in host resistance. Many immunostimulatory effects have been demonstrated including enhancing lymphoproliferative response to mitogens and lymphotropic activity, as well as increas- ing INF levels, antibody responses, immunoglobulin levels, secre- tion of thymic hormones, and integrity of ground substance.25,40 Vitamin C also has direct biochemical effects similar to those of INF.41 Numerous clinical studies support the use of vitamin C in the treat- ment of infectious conditions. In addition to its effects on the common cold, vitamin C has also been shown to be useful in other infectious conditions.42 Vitamin C levels are quickly depleted during the stress of an infection as well as in chronic disease.43 It is useful to supplement vitamin C concurrently with flavonoids, which raise the concentration of vitamin C in some tissues and poten- tiate its effects as well as exert their own effects.44

## Vitamin D

The importance of vitamin D on the regulation of cells of the immune system has gained increased appreciation with the discovery of the vita- min D receptor and key vitamin D metabolizing enzymes expressed by cells of the immune system. Effective in supporting both innate and adaptive immunity,45–49 vitamin D has been shown to do the following: • Upregulate antimicrobial peptides, namely cathelicidin, to enhance clearance of bacteria at various barrier sites and in immune cells • Modulate the adaptive immune system by direct effects on T-cell activation and on the phenotype and function of APCs • Protect against the development of autoimmune diseases (e.g., Crohn’s disease, juvenile diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis) • Reduce the frequency of viral upper respiratory infections Vitamin D appears to be especially important in protection against viral or bacterial upper respiratory infection.50 In Mongolian children with vitamin D deficiency who received milk fortified with 300 IU of vitamin D 3 , supplementation significantly reduced the risk of acute respiratory infections in winter.51 Additionally, 1200 IU/day of vita- min D 3 supplementation during the winter may reduce the incidence of influenza A and enhance innate immunity by upregulating antimi- crobial peptides, especially in specific subgroups of schoolchildren.52 In addition, weekly supplementation with 10,000 IU of vitamin D 3 is preventive for upper respiratory tract infections in young adults.53 A meta-analysis that considered 25 eligible randomized controlled tri- als found that vitamin D supplementation is safe and protects against acute respiratory tract infection overall, and patients who are very defi- cient in vitamin D and those not receiving bolus doses experienced the most benefit.54

## Vitamin E

Vitamin E enhances both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immu- nity. Deficiency in vitamin E results in lymphoid atrophy and decreases of lymphoproliferative response to mitogens, splenic plaque-forming colonies, antibody response, and monocyte function. Vitamin E sup- plementation (30–150 international units [IU]) has been shown to do the following55: • Increase lymphoproliferative response to mitogens • Prevent free-radical–induced thymus atrophy • Enhance helper T-cell activity • Increase splenic plaque-forming colonies, serum immunoglobu- lins, antibody response, PMN phagocytosis, and reticuloendothe- lial system activity Elderly subjects may benefit from even higher dosages of vitamin E. One study sought to determine the effect of vitamin E supplemen- tation at different dosages on immune function in 88 patients older than 65 years.56 The researchers measured T-cell function by assess- ing delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response; antibody response to hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, and pneumococcal vaccines; and autoantibodies to DNA and thyroglobulin to determine the effect of vitamin E on immune function. Vitamin E was given at 60, 200, or 800 IU for 235 days. Although the placebo group experienced an 8% increase in delayed-type hypersensitivity, the 60-IU group had a 20% increase, the 200-IU group had a 58% increase, and the 800-IU group had a 65% increase. Regarding antibody production, the best results were observed in the patients who received 200 IU daily. No effect on autoimmune antibodies was noticed. No adverse effects were observed at any of the three dosage schedules of vitamin E. In another double-blind study of 451 elderly participants in a nurs- ing home, vitamin E supplementation (200 IU/day) demonstrated a protective effect against upper respiratory tract infections, particularly the common cold.57

## Pyridoxine

A pyridoxine deficiency results in depression of cellular and humoral immunity, lymphoid tissue atrophy, leukopenia, reduction in quan- tity and quality of antibody production, diminished lymphoprolifer- ative response to mitogens, and decreased thymic hormone activity.25

<!-- chunk -->

## 1014SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

Factors predisposing to deficiency are low dietary pyridoxine intake, excess protein intake, consumption of hydralazine (yellow) dyes, and use of alcohol and oral contraception.

<!-- chunk -->

## Folic Acid and Vitamin B


The megaloblastic state induced by a deficiency of vitamin B 12 and/or folate results in improper WBC production and abnormal lymphocyte responses. Folic acid deficiency (the most common vitamin deficiency in the United States) has been shown to result in lymphoid atrophy and decreased lymphoproliferative response to mitogens, splenic plaque-forming colonies, and antibody production. A B 12 deficiency, besides producing a deficiency in folate conversion to its active tet- rahydrofolate form, leads to impairment of PMN phagocytosis and bactericidal action.25

## Other B Vitamins

Deficiencies of thiamin, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid lead to reduced antibody response, decreased splenic plaque-forming colo- nies, and lymphoid atrophy.

## Minerals

## Iron

Iron deficiency is a commonly encountered isolated nutritional defi- ciency causing immune dysfunction in large numbers of patients. Marginal iron deficiency, even at levels that do not lower hemoglobin values, can influence the immune system. Lymphoid tissue atrophy, decreased lymphoproliferative response to mitogens, defective macro- phage and neutrophil function, and decreased T-cell/B-cell ratios are common experimental and clinical findings.25 Iron is an important nutrient for bacteria as well as for humans. During infection, one of the body’s nonspecific defense mechanisms to limit bacterial growth is to reduce plasma iron, and in vitro studies have shown that the bacteriostatic effects and some of the bactericidal effects of serum are eliminated by the addition of iron to the serum.58 As temperature rises, plasma iron levels drop, and when temperature is raised to fever levels, the growth of bacteria is inhibited, but not at high iron concentrations. These observations suggest that iron supplementation may be con- traindicated during acute infection, especially in patients with low transferrin levels. However, in patients with impaired immune func- tion, chronic infections, and subnormal iron levels, adequate supple- mentation is essential.

## Trace Minerals

Trace minerals function primarily as activators of enzyme–metal–sub- strate complexes in which they are loosely bound cofactors. The role of these elements in metalloenzymes is either structural, in which they influence the reactivity of the protein by stabilizing strained configu- rations of binding ligands about the metal atom, or catalytic, in which they act as centers of positive charge.


Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a hereditary zinc-deficiency disease, offers an excellent model for understanding the role of zinc in immune function. In acrodermatitis enteropathica, the number of T cells is reduced, lymphoproliferative response to mitogens is diminished; thy- mic hormone levels are lower; delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity is decreased; and PMN phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and cytotoxic activities are impaired. All these effects are reversible upon adequate administra- tion and absorption of zinc.59 Zinc serves a vital role in many immune system reactions, For example, it promotes the binding of complement (C1q) to immune complex, acts as a protectant against iron-catalyzed damage by free radicals, acts synergistically with vitamin A, is required for lymphocyte transformation, acts independently on lymphocytes as a mitogen, and is a necessary cofactor in activating serum thymic factor. In vitro, zinc inhibits the growth of several viruses, including rhinoviruses, picorna- viruses, togaviruses, herpes simplex virus, and vaccinia virus.60 Adequate zinc nutrition is particularly important in the elderly, and zinc supplementation in elderly subjects results in increased numbers of T cells and enhanced cell-mediated immune responses.60 Throat lozenges containing zinc became popular in the treatment of the common cold because of a double-blind clinical trial in demonstrating that zinc-containing lozenges significantly reduced the average duration of common colds by 7 days.61 The lozenges used in this study contained 23 mg of elemental zinc, which the patients were instructed to dissolve in their mouths every 2 waking hours after an initial double dose. After 7 days, 86% of the 37 zinc-treated subjects were symptom-free compared with 46% of the 28 place- bo-treated subjects. Additional studies confirmed these results.62 Meta-analyses demonstrated that zinc may shorten the duration of colds by approximately 33%, and patients with a common cold may be instructed to try zinc within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.63 Zinc gluconate lozenges were found to be as effective as zinc ace- tate lozenges. No evidence supports that zinc doses more than mg/day might lead to greater efficacy in the treatment of the com- mon cold. Because high doses of zinc can impair immune function, a daily intake higher than 150 mg for longer than 1 week cannot be recommended.

## Selenium

Selenium plays a vital role in glutathione peroxidase and affects all components of the immune system, including the development and expression of all WBCs. Selenium deficiency results in depression of immune function, and selenium supplementation results in augmen- tation and/or restoration of immune functions. Selenium deficiency has been found to inhibit resistance to infection through impairment of WBC and thymus function, whereas selenium supplementation (100–200 mcg/day) has been shown to stimulate WBCs and thymus function.64–67 The ability of selenium supplementation to enhance immune function goes beyond simply restoring selenium levels. For example, in one study, selenium supplementation (200 mcg/day) to individu- als with normal blood selenium concentrations resulted in a 118% improvement in the ability of lymphocytes to kill tumor cells and an 82.3% rise in the activity of natural killer cells.65 These effects were related to the ability of selenium to enhance the expression of the immune-enhancing compound IL-2 and, consequently, the rate of WBC proliferation and differentiation into forms capable of killing tumor cells and microorganisms. The supplementation regimen did not produce significant changes in the blood selenium levels of the participants. The results indicated that the immune-enhancing effects of selenium in humans require supplementation above the normal dietary intake.

# ENHANCING THYMUS FUNCTION

Perhaps the most effective method of reestablishing a healthy immune system is employing measures to improve thymus function. Promoting optimal thymus gland activity involves the following: • Prevention of thymic involution or shrinkage by ensuring adequate dietary intake of antioxidant nutrients • Use of nutrients that are required in the manufacture or action of thymic hormones

<!-- chunk -->

## 1015CHAPTER 136 Immune System Support


The thymus gland shows maximum development immediately after birth. During the aging process, the thymus gland undergoes a pro- cess of shrinkage, or involution. Involution occurs because the thymus gland is extremely susceptible to free-radical and oxidative damage caused by stress, radiation, infection, and chronic illness. Many patients with impaired immune function as well as condi- tions associated with impaired immunity (e.g., chronic fatigue syn- drome, cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) experience a state of oxidative imbalance characterized by a greater number of pro- oxidants than antioxidants. This situation is quite detrimental to thy- mus function. One primary way that antioxidants affect the immune system, particularly cell-mediated immunity, may be by protecting the thymus gland from damage. The antioxidant nutrients most important for protecting the thymus include the carotenes, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and selenium.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrients

Many nutrients function as important cofactors in the manufacture, secretion, and function of thymic hormones. A deficiency in any one of these nutrients results in decreased thymic hormone action and impaired immune function. Zinc, vitamin B 6 , and vitamin C are perhaps the most critical. Supplementation with these nutrients has been shown to improve thymic hormone function and cell-mediated immunity. Zinc may be the critical mineral involved in thymus gland func- tion and thymus hormone action. Zinc is involved in virtually every aspect of immunity. When zinc levels are low, the number of T cells is reduced, thymic hormone levels are lower, and many WBC functions critical to the immune response are severely lacking. All these effects are reversible with adequate administration and absorption of zinc.68,69

# BOTANICALS

Many herbs have been shown to have antibacterial, antiviral, and immunostimulatory effects. A complete discussion is outside the scope of this chapter, but several immune-enhancing botanicals (e.g., Echinacea, Hydrastis canadensis, and Panax ginseng) are discussed in depth in Section 5. Astragalus membranaceus is a traditional Chinese medicine used for viral infections. As with Echinacea, the polysaccharides contained in the root of Astragalus membranaceus contribute to the immune- enhancing effects. Clinical studies in China have shown it to be effec- tive when used prophylactically against the common cold.70 It has also been shown to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms in the acute treatment of the common cold as well as to raise WBC counts in persons with chronic leukopenia. Research in animals showed that Astragalus works by stimulating several factors of the immune sys- tem, including enhancing the phagocytic activity of monocytes and macrophages, increasing INF production and natural killer cell activ- ity, improving T-cell activity, and potentiating other antiviral mech- anisms.70,71 Astragalus may be particularly useful in cases in which the immune system has been damaged by chemicals or radiation. In immuno-depressed mice, Astragalus was found to reverse the T-cell abnormalities caused by cyclophosphamide, radiation, and aging.72

## Yeast Beta-Glucans and Medicinal Mushrooms

Extracts and preparations of Baker’s yeast and medicinal mush- rooms like maitake (Grifola frondosa), shiitake (Lentinus edodes), rei- shi (Ganoderma lucidum), and Cordyceps sinensis possess significant immune-enhancing effects. Much of the immune-enhancing activity is due to the presence of β -glucans. Numerous in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies showed that yeast and fungal β -glucans activate WBCs by binding to receptors like dectin-1 on the outer membranes of neu- trophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T cells.73,74 Similar to a key in a lock, the binding of β -glucan to cellular recep- tors flips WBCs on and triggers a chain reaction leading to increased immune activity. In addition to increasing the ability of neutrophils and macrophages to engulf and destroy microbes, cancer cells, and other foreign cells, the binding stimulates the production of important signaling proteins such as IL-1, IL-2, and lymphokines. These immune activators ramp up defenses by activating immune cells. One of the best-researched β -glucan sources is Wellmune WGP, a whole glucan particle composed of 1,3-1,6- β -glucan derived from the cell walls of a highly purified, proprietary baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Once absorbed, Wellmune is taken up by macrophages, digested into smaller fragments, and slowly released over several days. The fragments bind to neutrophils, via complement receptor 3, and enhance their activity. Double-blind clinical studies have been con- ducted with Wellmune WGP, demonstrating positive results in reduc- ing the signs, symptoms, frequency, and duration of upper respiratory infections. In a study involving marathon runners, Wellmune WGP significantly reduced symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (e.g., sore throat, stuffy nose) in test subjects.75 Furthermore, the Wellmune group reported 22% higher scores in vigor, a 48% reduc- tion in fatigue, a 38% reduction in tension, and a 38% reduction in confusion over the control groups. In a double-blind study during the cold and flu season, compared with the placebo group, the Wellmune WGP group reported (1) no inci- dence of fever compared with 3.5 incidences over a 90-day period; (2) no need to take a “sick day” from work or school, compared with 1.38 days of work/school missed for the placebo group; and (3) an increase in general health, including physical energy and emotional well-being.76 In a study of 122 healthy volunteers, participants taking 250 mg of Wellmune WGP daily for 12 weeks reported a 58% reduction in upper respiratory tract infection symptoms compared with individuals taking a placebo.77 These subjects also experienced improvement in energy levels compared with the placebo group.

## Microbiota

Bacterial colonization of the intestine is critical for the normal func- tion of the human immune system. The specific molecules produced by commensal bacteria that contribute to the modulation of the host immune system are largely uncharacterized. However, polysaccharide A (PSA), produced by the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis, is a model symbiosis factor. PSA is capable of activating T-cell–dependent immune responses that can affect the development and homeostasis of the host immune system and also has a critical influence on the stimulation of IL-10–producing CD4+ T cells.78 Consequently, PSA confers benefit to the host with regard to autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. The effect of the microbiota composition on systemic immune-mediated diseases is just beginning to be appreci- ated. However, there is strong evidence for a functional link between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and susceptibility to sev- eral systemic immune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic diseases (Fig. 136.4).79


A major challenge to the discerning clinician is determining which of the preceding factors is key to reactivating or supporting a patient’s immune system. The regimen presented here is meant as a general approach and must be tailored to the patient’s specific needs to maxi- mize the desired effects and limit unnecessary treatment.

## General Measures

• Get sufficient rest (bed rest is better). • Drink a large amount of fluids (preferably diluted vegetable juices, soups, and herb teas). • Limit simple sugar consumption (including fruit sugars) to less than 50 g/day.


• High-potency multivitamin and mineral formula: • Vitamin C, 500 to 1000 mg every 2 hours • Bioflavonoids, 1000 mg/day • Vitamin A, 2500 IU/day (if patient has genetics to convert to vitamin A: β -carotene 25,000 IU/day can be used as an alterna- tive) • Vitamin D 3 , 2000 IU/day • Zinc, 30 mg/day

<!-- chunk -->

## Botanicals

All doses of botanicals should be given three times per day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Echinacea spp

• Dried root (or as tea), 0.5 to 1 g • Freeze-dried plant, 325 to 650 mg • Juice of aerial portion of Echinacea purpurea stabilized in 22% ethanol, 2 to 3 mL • Tincture (1:5), 2 to 4 mL • Fluid extract (1:1), 2 to 4 mL • Solid (dry powdered) extract (6.5:1 or 3.5% echinacoside), to 300 mg

<!-- chunk -->

## Astragalus membranaceus

• Dried root (or as decoction), 1 to 2 g • Tincture (1:5), 2 to 4 mL • Fluid extract (1:1), 2 to 4 mL • Solid (dry powdered) extract (0.5% 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy iso- flavone), 100 to 150 mg

<!-- chunk -->

## Yeast and Medicinal Mushrooms

The dosage for Wellmune WGP used in clinical trials was 250 mg of 1,3-1,6- β -glucan daily. For maitake, the dosage is based on body weight and β -glucan content, stated as MD- or D-fraction (typically 0.5–1.0 mg for every kilogram of body weight per day). The dosage for shiitake and reishi is based on historical dosage levels of the dried mushrooms of 6 to 9 g/day.

Antibody IL-17 IL-17R CD4+ T cell SYSTEMIC RESPONSE IC Neutrophil Fig. 136.4 An autoimmune arthritis model that demonstrates the link between gut microbiota and extraintes- tinal disease. SFB, Segmented filamentous bacteria The K/BxN arthritis model was used to demonstrate how the gut microbiota can influence a non–gut-associated disease. K/BxN mice express a transgene- encoded T-cell receptor that reacts to a self-peptide. Colonization of SFB in the gut induces the differentiation of Th17 cells (step 1 and 2), which subsequently exit the gut and migrate into the peripheral lymphoid tissue. The gut origin of Th17 cells can be identified by their expression of the α4β7 receptor, imprinted on these T cells by intestinal-mucosa-associated DCs (step 3). Interleukin (IL)-17, in turn, acts directly on B cells to provide help in the differentiation of germinal center B cells and the production of autoantibody in the spleen (step 4). The autoantibody then circulates into its target organ joints, which ultimately leads to the development of disease. (From Wu HJ, Wu E.

## 1021CHAPTER 137 Let the Data Speak

patient’s Excel spreadsheet over the past 40 years of my practice. Doing so gave me a feel for the patient, similar to how chefs get a feel of the meal as it passes through their hands in the kitchen. I took a sample of 20,000 symptoms from the questionnaires of many patients, and from that body of data, I reconciled variations in my coding assignments that occurred over the years. Coding the implication of symptoms was facil- itated by the use of a system in which the body system, function, and location are used as a basis for establishing the literal meaning of the words we use to name symptoms. Using symptom, function, and loca- tion from the conventional medical lexicon expanded to include des- ignations made in the course of patients’ narrative, the system scheme grew to include 50 systems, 50 functions, and hundreds of locations, the latter ranging from anatomic to geographic.1 Table 137.3 provides three examples of NMI symptoms in which the English-language ver- nacular “uptight” gives a glimpse of a unifying feature that is not found in the commonalities of body system, function, or location. From those normalized data, I was able to conclude the remarkably small number of implications to be found in a diverse population of patients of all ages and diagnoses. The small number of implications came from letting the data talk and in no way was a list that I had cre- ated at the beginning of this project except that I had, in the course of the project, created a mini-checklist for neuromuscular irritability as a teaching tool for patients to understand the functional medicine style of thinking when it comes to the clues to unmet needs for magnesium. Table 137.4 provides the magnesium checklist used for data acquisi- tion with general medical patients.2 Table 137.5 shows Morgan’s list of past NMI symptoms, and Table 137.6 shows his current symptoms. As it happens, Morgan has an exceptionally large group of such symptoms. Clinicians may protest that the questionnaire and its harvest are overkill. Parents, on the other hand, benefit from having the details of a story that has so intensely occupied their time, emo- tions, and curiosity be heard and having sense made of it. The data on which we drive the decision to prescribe magnesium “to bowel toler- ance” is soft. I should note that our colleague Derrick Lonsdale, MD, makes the point that unmet needs for vitamin B 1 have a symptom list that overlaps with this one, which reminds us that the data we are gathering and using to drive simple clinical decisions about interven- tions are essentially free of risk, with good odds for benefit, at low cost, in a setting where the stakes are very high. On the other hand, we have here a situation in which the only accurate way to assess magnesium status is a pair of 24-hour urine measurements with an intramuscular dose of magnesium in each buttock that could easily be wasted into wet pants, bed, or diapers. There is a good chance that all children on the autism spectrum and most individuals with chronic illness have unmet needs for magnesium. Why go to the trouble of asking all these questions if a clinical trial of magnesium to bowel tolerance may do the job? Respect! Respect for the sacred, respectful conver- sation. Respect for the data; the patient/parent who has harvested it with worry, attention, and love; and our own integrity—threatened as it is by the demands of complex patients and a tight appointment schedule.

## 1022SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

For four decades my parents and patients have filled out my ques- tionnaire as a Word document, from which I move the symptoms checklist to Excel, where I tag the symptoms that guide decisions. I move it back to the patient’s Word document, where the effort taken to record the data is rewarded in three ways: • Patients who have previously had doctors ignore records are relieved to see them taken seriously. • Patients understand that symptoms drive decisions in sometimes very specific ways. • At a subsequent follow-up visit, patients are less likely to have sim- ply forgotten the very symptoms that had driven treatment deci- sions. • The idea and practice that the patient, not the disease, is the target of treatment are honored while crossing the solid bridge between the details of the narrative and a solution aimed at the individual. Unmet needs for magnesium are rampant in our culture and displayed in all sorts of symptoms of being uptight—chronic stress; dietary sugars; and the agricultural use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers that lack the magnesium needed to meet the demands of animals and, needless to say, humans, such as patients stressed by chronic illness.

If a patient will bring the questionnaire input to a simple interface on an anonymous website where the data are examined and understood from the same perspective that I have described, then a simple report can be shared with the clinician who made the referral to the website. Done in this way, the process creates a shared responsibility in which the input helps awaken the patient to the value of the narrative and rewards the patient with simple information about steps to be taken in collaboration with the referring clinician. Instead of poring over a long questionnaire and writing up a plan based on its most conspicu- ous options, the clinician’s job of interpreting the implications of the patient’s symptoms is simplified by the tailored documentation of the part of the patient’s plan that that is based on symptoms and leaves room for interpretation and explanation of laboratory results. Such a website is pending. You will be able to help the website grow to be a collaborative endeavor in which users may offer pearls and the string that joins them in ways that reflect a practice of medicine in which not the disease but the patient is the target of treatment and the symptoms of the patient provide the most sensitive data that captures the patient’s individuality.

## NMI Guidance Example

NMI is an abbreviation for neuromuscular irritability. Neuromuscular means nerves, brain, and/or muscles. Irritability means an increase in function triggered at a low threshold.

## Short Guidance Report

You (patient or parent) report the following symptoms of NMI, or you have been linked here through constipation and/or reference to magnesium. (NMI symptoms in Tables 137.5 and 137.6.) PROBLEM: Over the past centuries, people living in modern soci- eties have suffered from changes in soil, food, and stress, giving rise to unmet needs for magnesium. ANSWER: Supplemental magnesium is safe and convenient. Dietary change is difficult but necessary. Stress reduction requires tak- ing its measure and tailoring to individual sensitivity. OPTIONS a. Laboratory testing is only of value if done in a way that is incon- venient but may be critical for some individuals; however, it is not well suited to children. b. Avoidance of sugar c. Supplementation with magnesium EXAMPLES: A boy in his late teens goes away to college and starts to live on pizza, beer, and ice cream. Although a good student, he starts having severe anxiety to the point of panic attacks. He develops an irregular heartbeat called paroxysmal tachycardia. He is constipated, his sleep is poor, and he awakens with leg cramps. Over the winter

## 1024SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

Hypomagnesemia is mentioned, but that just means low blood magnesium. My friend and colleague Leo Galland, MD, awakened my interest in 1980 after he had met Mildred Seelig, author of Magnesium Deficiency in the Pathogenesis of Disease.3 It says a lot that a medical book would be reprinted in its original text 32 years later. A lot of things in med- icine had changed, but not the basics of magnesium, including the indifference of most medical professionals while all sorts of drugs have come along to treat symptoms that would respond promptly to a sup- plement of magnesium. Most people have little need for nutritional supplements if they consume a good diet. Vitamins A and D are exceptions, and mag- nesium is noteworthy for the prevalence of unmet needs for magne- sium. There is, moreover, a wide range of effective magnesium doses. A few people have very large needs. They are “magnesium wasters,” about whom I published “Magnesium Deficiency in Primary Care and Preventive Medicine: Symptom Profiles in Relation to Magnesium Loading Studies.”4 Let me briefly cover the laboratory test that helps discover such individuals for whom certain symptoms may be clues to their special needs. The checklist in Table 137.4 helped me alert my patients’ attention to the diverse symptoms that indicate an unmet need for magnesium. Such symptoms scatter in questionnaires and checklists of specialists who naturally group symptoms focused in their areas of interest. Here they are grouped to illustrate how the notion of “uptight” is expressed in different ways. Magnesium wasters are distinctive in having low blood pressure, fewer digestive symptoms, and fewer symptoms of inflammation, but more emotional symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Testing for Magnesium Status

The laboratory test that accurately measures a person’s magnesium status is a 24-hour urinary loading test, which takes 2 days before and during which diet and supplements are unchanged. After the first hours, when every drop of urine is collected, a second 24-hour collec- tion is started after injecting 200 mg of elemental magnesium, as the sulfate. It is painful, and thus it is best to add a local anesthetic and give it slowly, deep in the upper outer buttocks, giving half of the 5-cc volume in each cheek (2 mL of 50% MgSO4 plus 0.5 mL of lidocaine). A second 24 hours’ worth of urine is then collected, and calculations assess the percentage of the injected magnesium dose that was retained. • Normal retention is up to 10%. • Borderline retention is 10% to 20%. • More than 20% retention is consistent with magnesium deficiency. • Retention of 50% or more indicates marked deficiency. • Wasters excrete 15% or more of the injected dose. Now I tend to use this test only when symptoms suggest that a person may be a magnesium waster or if supplementing magnesium to a dose that is just short of producing frequent or loose bowel movements— what I call bowel tolerance—does not alleviate the symptoms that sug- gested unmet needs for magnesium. Beyond that consideration, the magnesium story is quite simple: The benefit is high, the risk is zero, the odds are good, the cost is mini- mal, and the stakes are quite high given the importance of magnesium in more than 300 places in the body’s chemistry. NMI symptoms predict a positive response to meeting an unmet need for magnesium. Most, but not all, people with unmet needs for magnesium have at least a few of these symptoms, which overlap with those that brought the patient to this insight. Some of the symptoms have a higher value than others in that prediction, and the more symp- toms a patient has, the greater becomes the chance of relief with mag- nesium supplementation.

## How Do We Develop Unmet Needs for Magnesium?

Imagine your five-hundredth great-great-great-grandmother. She was a hunter-gatherer heading down to a river to fill her calabash with water for her migrating family. On the way, she encounters a beast and flees, with the beast in pursuit. Good fortune and strong legs bring her to a tree she can climb. There, she hangs on for dear life until the beast finally gets bored and leaves. Descending from the tree, she empties her bladder before heading back to the river. Her urine is rich in magne- sium. It had shifted from inside her muscle cells into the bloodstream and into her bladder during her previous running, climbing, and hang- ing on. That shift was an essential component of her stress response. Grandma returns to her campsite and replenishes her magnesium losses with a good meal of vegetation and a side order of beast. In other words, stress of the kind Grandma experienced is associated with a natural loss of magnesium, which must then be replenished by eating. Encounters with beasts in Grandma’s time were infrequent. The mus- cular demands for magnesium’s shifts for daily activities were modest. Her diet was adequate and free of sugar. Compare her situation with those of us who live the modern way: 1. Since the 1950s, the soil of the major agricultural areas where our food is grown has been fertilized with nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus but not with magnesium. 2. The magnesium content of the harvests has fallen, affecting con- sumers while not impairing the hardiness of the plants. 3. Since the 1950s, the diet of those living in modern industrialized countries has become sugarier and starchier. 4. Finally, the stresses in modern life are more like having a constant beastly presence than rare encounters with beastly attacks. The combined effects of low magnesium intake and high stress- related magnesium losses have caused a failure to meet the needs of a very substantial proportion of the population.

<!-- chunk -->

## Uptight

Our language aptly summarizes the way our bodies respond to danger. The theme of the checklist’s NMI selections is captured by the word uptight: It applies equally to muscles and emotions. That response produces a tendency toward magnesium loss that is not replenished when the diet is low in magnesium. The resulting nervous and/or mus- cular contraction tension is associated with further magnesium shifts and losses. A vicious cycle, right? The more you become deficient in magnesium, the more you tend toward nervousness and/or muscular tension, which, in turn, tends to cause magnesium losses. Magnesium wasters simply cannot hang on to their magnesium and require espe- cially large doses of magnesium given intravenously to correct their problem.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Patient Is the Best Laboratory

For research, no test substitutes for magnesium-loading testing. The studies that I published revealing the distinctive symptom pro- file of magnesium wasters could not have been done without many magnesium-loading tests. On the other hand, the symptoms of mag- nesium deficit are so common and easy to spot that a trial of mag- nesium supplementation turns out to be a practical first—and often final—step in documenting magnesium problems. Given orally, magnesium is safe, except for individuals who have poor kidney function. The symptom of a magnesium overdose is diarrhea, so with the escalation of magnesium supplementation, loose bowel move- ments will reliably indicate an excess well before any other mischief could be produced. Taking magnesium “to bowel tolerance” and observing the effect on symptoms of neuromuscular irritability is the best test for unmet needs for magnesium.

## To Bowel Tolerance

To replenish magnesium, start with a teaspoon of CALM—in water— magnesium or one capsule of 150 mg of magnesium citrate in the evening. These doses would be safe for children and adults, but for children who do not swallow capsules and for toddlers, CALM alone would do just fine. A daily increase in dosage by adding a teaspoon of CALM and 1 capsule of magnesium citrate (in a child or adult) will, in a matter of a week or two, produce more frequent and loose bowel movements. The idea is to increase up to the point short of risking a bowel accident. For an adult, this is not rocket science. For children and those with impaired sensory function, this trial requires precision and vigilance to avoid the humiliation of a bowel accident. The dose of magnesium that reliably results in two easy bowel movements daily is valuable knowledge. Knowing the limit of the magnesium dose will be useful if constipation is provoked by interventions, such as activated charcoal and antifungal medication, described in Section 4 and pre- sented in detail in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Pebble in Your Shoe

Establishing a dose of magnesium at bowel tolerance first provides a way of dealing with constipation if it is already a problem. Then it gives a baseline for dealing with constipation should it arise. Most of all, it lets us see improvement in NMI symptoms and allows us to expect the alleviation of other, less noticeable problems that are solved by meeting magnesium needs. Magnesium is a cofactor in dozens of steps in every aspect of body chemistry. Many of these steps are relatively silent com- pared with those related to tension in the nerves and muscles. Keep in mind therefore that as important as magnesium is in correcting “uptight” symptoms, those symptoms are not the only target of mag- nesium supplementation. Removing a pebble from your shoe is not just for your foot but also for the journey.

# NMI EXPANDED GUIDANCE SUMMARY

1. The target of treatment in chronic illness is the individual, not the disease. 2. Treatment involves addressing unmet special needs to receive, avoid, or be rid of things, which—if addressed—will favor nature’s buoyant impulse toward healing. 3. Before a particular intervention becomes a treatment, it is a test to see if it produces a benefit for the individual in question. 4. In many ways, such a test can be the best (or even the exclusive) way of finding what will work for a given individual. 5. Magnesium is a good example of a commonly effective therapeu- tic agent for children and adults with every sort of chronic illness. When it relieves symptoms of neuromuscular irritability, including constipation, it will likely benefit many areas of biochemistry where it is an important helper. 6. A person may have other symptoms of neuromuscular irritability but no constipation. A trial of magnesium to bowel tolerance is still a good idea because it is the best means of judging the benefits of magnesium and preparing for the constipation that may come with a Herx reaction.

## 1027CHAPTER 138 Mycotoxin Exposure: Assessment and Treatment

Studies have shown that many different types of mycotoxins can be carcinogenic, which seems to stem from three possible factors. First is their ability to cause oxidative stress in cells, and second is their abil- ity to cause DNA adducts.22 Mycotoxins in cells cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) to increase. These ROS molecules lead to breaks in DNA molecules. However, a more common cause of DNA damage seems to be the mycotoxins’ ability to covalently bind to DNA. Reports show that mycotoxins cause adducts on the N-7 position of guanine and the N-3 position of adenine. These adducts can interfere with DNA syn- thesis and can cause an incorrect substitution of a nucleotide or cause

a deletion to occur.23 The third possible cause of DNA damage from mycotoxins is inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I and II enzymes. These enzymes are required to untangle DNA during replication, and inhibition of these enzymes could lead to the accumulation of DNA breaks.24

# MOLD SPECIES

Of the 400 known mycotoxins, there are 10 to 15 that have so far been linked to human disease. These are produced by about 350 different fungi species; however, some species are more prevalent than oth- ers.25 Some of the most common mycotoxin-producing genera are Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Stachybotrys.26

<!-- chunk -->

## Aspergillus

Aspergillus is the most prevalent mold genus in the environment. The two most common Aspergillus mycotoxins are aflatoxin and ochra- toxin, and their main target is the liver.27,28 Aspergillus species are commonly associated with indoor air problems.29 The most common route of transmission for Aspergillus is inhalation.30 Because Aspergillus spores are smaller than most other species, 2 to μ m, they can reach the lower airways. This can lead to fungal colonization, which results in prolonged mycotoxin exposure and allergic responses. This can lead to allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and asthma.31 These toxins have also been found in all major cereal crops, includ- ing peanuts, corn, cotton, millet, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, wheat, and a variety of spices. They are also found in eggs, milk, and meat from animals fed contaminated grains. This has caused billions of dollars in damage to crops and livestock.32 There are multiple spe- cies of Aspergillus that can produce toxic metabolites (see Table 138.1). Some of the more common Aspergillus species that can induce diseases are A. flavus, A. niger, A. fumigatus, and A. versicolor.33 A. flavus is one of the more common fungal contaminants in agri- culture. It has caused the loss of millions of dollars in crop damage and animal infection. The leading route of exposure to this species is the consumption of contaminated food, such as peanuts, milk, corn, rice, and coffee.34,35 A. flavus infections can lead to cutaneous aspergillosis, keratitis, granulomatous sinusitis, and osteomyelitis.36 A. niger is one of the most common mold species because of its abil- ity to grow on many different types of substances, such as food, soil, and indoor material. A. niger invades tissues that have been rendered susceptible by bacterial infections or physical injury. It can colonize the ear, nose, or throat, causing chronic infections. Patients who are immune compromised could develop pulmonary aspergillosis, which is characterized by chronic productive cough.37 A. fumigatus is the most common mold associated with pulmonary infections. A. fumigatus is also able to produce polypeptide allergen molecules that can cause asthma and rhinitis symptoms.38 A. fumiga- tus mycotoxin products (see Table 138.1) cause immune suppression during hyphal growth in favorable conditions. Recent studies have linked these immune-compromising abilities to other opportunistic infections that occur in patients exposed to this mold.39 A. versicolor is commonly found in damp indoor environments and on food products.40 This mold produces more than 20 allergens that can irritate the nose, eyes, and throat.41 A. versicolor is one of the more invasive species of aspergillosis.42 This fungus has also been reported to be a major cause of onychomycosis (a fungal infection of the nails).43

## Fusarium

Fusarium fungi grow best in temperate climate conditions.44 Fusarium is present in both indoor as well as outdoor environments.45 It also grows worldwide on many different types of grains, including corn and wheat.46 Most trichothecene mycotoxins are produced from Fusarium species. The fungi can infiltrate the body through breaks in the skin or through inhalation. One other source of exposure is ingestion through contaminated foods. Fusarium infections are more likely with indi- viduals who are immune compromised. These infections can lead to pneumonia, thrombophlebitis, and sinusitis.47 Two of the most com- mon species of Fusarium are F. verticilliodes and F. solani. F. verticilliodes commonly contaminates grains, maize, and rice.48 F. verticilliodes infections are more common in immune-compromised individuals than in healthy individuals. F. verticilliodes infections have also been reported in patients who have undergone a major organ transplant. Infections with this fungus have been reported to cause neutropenia, keratomycosis, necrotic lesions on the skin, and fever.49 F. solani is one of the most virulent of all of the Fusarium species.50 In patients who are immune compromised, F. solani can cause arthri- tis, cutaneous infections, subcutaneous infections, and sinusitis.51 Some strains of F. solani have been reported to produce a biofilm on soft contact lenses. F. solani is also resistant to many antifungal agents but has been shown to be sensitive to amphotericin B and natamycin.

## Penicillium

Penicillium is a blue-green mold found on fruits, vegetables, and indoor environments. Many different types of citrus fruits can become contaminated with Penicillium, but it can also contaminate seeds and grains. Factors leading to a contamination of Penicillium in the home, work, or school environment include inadequate heating and venti- lation, water leaks, and low sunlight.52 Indoor environments where Penicillium can be found include wallpaper, carpet, furniture, and fiberglass insulation. Exposure to Penicillium can lead to breathing dif- ficulties such as wheezing, persistent cough, and asthma.53 Besides the mycotoxins that are produced by Penicillium, there are several other allergens produced that affect human health. These include alkaline and vacuolar serine proteases, which are referred to as group 13 and group 18 allergens, respectively.54

<!-- chunk -->

## Stachybotrys

Stachybotrys is a greenish-black mold. This mold can grow on mate- rials with a high cellulose and low nitrogen content, such as gypsum board, paper, fiberboard, and ceiling tiles. The humidity requirements for Stachybotrys are higher than those for other fungi, around 93%, whereas other fungi grow at approximately 75%, and it often occurs in the presence of other fungi.6,55 Toxicity caused by Stachybotrys is mostly through the toxins and other compounds produced and less so from particle penetration from the spores. Stachybotrys spores are between 10 and μ m, which is too large to reach the alveoli.56 Toxin production is dependent on nutrient levels, pH, temperature, and moisture. Stachybotrys spores are produced when there is high mois- ture content, and they become airborne when they dry out and are disturbed or when they are attached to dust particles.57 In addition to mycotoxins, Stachybotrys produces nine phenylspirodrimanes, which inhibit complement activation; spirolactams and spriolactones, which are anticomplement components; cyclosporine, which is a potent immunosuppressor; as well as endothelin receptors antagonists.58–60

# COMMON MYCOTOXINS

As previously mentioned, there are more than 400 known mycotox- ins naturally produced by fungi in nature.12 These toxins have been observed since the Middle Ages and were recognized to come from fungi in the 17th century.61 The most common mycotoxins that can cause diseases in humans are aflatoxin, ochratoxin, gliotoxin, sterig- matocystin, and citrinin. Mycotoxins are produced by multiple species

<!-- chunk -->

## 1030SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

of fungi depending on environmental conditions (see Table 138.1). The following summary discusses some of the more common myco- toxins and what organs they target.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aflatoxin

Aflatoxin is produced by the fungi Aspergillus and is one of the most potent hepatocarcinogenic substances known.62 The production of aflatoxin is dependent on the fungi’s access to O 2 , CO 2 , zinc, and copper.63 There are four major aflatoxins, called B 1 , B 2 , G 1 , and G 2 , of which B 1 is the most toxic.64 Aflatoxin has been shown to be both toxic and carcinogenic to the human population, and the diseases caused by aflatoxin exposure are labeled aflatoxicoses. The liver is the primary target for aflatoxin. Aflatoxin is activated in the liver by the cytochrome P450s and is then capable of forming adducts to both DNA and proteins.65 These DNA adducts may result in the activation of oncogenes, inhibition of DNA synthesis, disruption of DNA rep- lication, and improper cellular division, leading to polypoidal cells.66 Aflatoxin is removed through the glutathione S-transferase system. This system can conjugate activated aflatoxin with reduced glutathi- one. This leads to aflatoxin becoming more water soluble, which assists in its excretion. It is theorized that variations in levels of P450s, gluta- thione transferase, and transporters can account for the variation in the response patients have to aflatoxin exposure.67

<!-- chunk -->

## Ochratoxin

Ochratoxin is produced by species of Penicillium and Aspergillus. There are three forms of ochratoxin; however, only the A form exerts hazard- ous effects on humans. Ochratoxin is a common mycotoxin associated with indoor air problems; however, it is also known to contaminate many different types of food, such as cereals, meat, coffee, fruits, wine, and beer.68,69 Ochratoxin can be distributed to many different tissues throughout the body, but its main targets are the liver and kidney. Ochratoxin is both nephrotoxic and carcinogenic to the kid- ney (Fig. 138.2).70 Two of the most important mechanisms involved in ochratoxin toxicity include competition with phenylalanine in the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase-catalyzed reaction, inhibiting protein synthesis, and induction of oxidative stress by lipid peroxidation.71,72 Ochratoxin also has immunosuppressive effects. Exposure leads to the inhibition of T-helper-cell function and inhibition of antibody synthe- sis.73 Crucial immune organs have also been shown to decrease in size from exposure, such as the thymus, bursa of Fabricius (in birds), the spleen, and lymph nodes.74 This can lead to the overgrowth of intesti- nal pathogens such as Candida or Clostridia.75

<!-- chunk -->

## Gliotoxin

Gliotoxin is produced by species of the fungi Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Alternaria. Gliotoxin exposure can be the result of contaminated food as well as from water damage. Gliotoxin is secreted by newly established hyphae, and its role is to inhibit the immune system of the host. Gliotoxin suppresses the phagocytic defenses, which is done by interfering with PtdIns (3,4,5) P 3 production. This impairs the mac- rophages’ abilities to recognize, take up, and destroy invading patho- gens.76,77 Another way that gliotoxin promotes immunosuppression is by interfering with the activation of transcription factors that are involved in T-cell activation.16 Gliotoxin’s effects can lead to infections of Aspergillus, known as aspergillosis, which typically reside in the pul- monary system, the ears, the eyes, or the nails.

# METHODS OF ASSESSMENT

For the past two decades, one of the greatest difficulties involving patients who may have been exposed to mycotoxins was determining whether the patient was exposed. For many years, researchers have been measuring mycotoxins in crops as well as in animals. The agri- cultural market needed a quick and inexpensive method to determine whether food was contaminated with mycotoxins and if it was fit for consumption. These methods have been attempted to be transferred to the analysis of human exposure; however, there are two barriers that

## 1031CHAPTER 138 Mycotoxin Exposure: Assessment and Treatment

have prevented an easy transition. The first barrier has been the small quantity of mycotoxin in human samples, often in the parts per tril- lion (ppt), which can also be labeled ng/L. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action level for aflatoxin in food is 20 ppb (20 μ g/L), which is a factor 100 times higher than seen in human sam- ples.78,79 Sample ranges for many mycotoxins in humans are normally in the range of 60 to 2000 ng/L (.06–2 μ g/L).79 The second barrier for transferring methods used in agriculture to human samples is matrix effects (MEs). MEs are compounds in the sample matrix that are not related to the analyte being measured but can cause a result to be either higher or lower than the actual amount. These MEs can influence any type of test, and protocols must be performed to separate the analyte of interest from these interferences.80 There are two types of testing used to ascertain whether a patient has been exposed to mycotoxins, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatog- raphy–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

# ELISA

ELISA has been used for analytical testing since the early 1970s.81 ELISA can use multiple types of samples, such as (but not limited to) saliva, serum, and urine. It is used to detect the presence of antibodies or antigens in a sample. This technique normally uses 96-well plates, which are analyzed by a spectrometer. Antibodies are produced that can have direct degrees of selectivity to an antigen. The selection of an antibody will determine the specificity for an ELISA test. Most ELISA tests for mycotoxin use the competitive direct ELISA model. There are several steps involved in this model: 1. The primary antibody, which is specific to the analyte that is being measured, is incubated with the sample. During this step, the ana- lyte that is being tested binds with the primary antibody. Any free antibody that is not bound at this step will bind with the antigen that is bound to the wells in step 2. 2. The antibody–antigen complex produced in step 1 is added to 96-well plates. These plates are coated with the same antigen (ana- lyte) being testing. Free antibody that was not bound in step 1 will bind to the antigen coated to the wells. More antigen in the patient sample will lead to less antibody being bound to the plates. 3. After incubation, the plates are washed, which removes the anti- bodies that have been complexed to the patient’s antigens. 4. The next step is to incubate a secondary antibody, which binds to the primary antibody. This secondary antibody has some type of label or enzyme covalently bound, which will cause a color change in the well. There are now three layers bound to the plate. The first layer is the antigen that is bound to the plate, the second layer is the primary antibody, and the third layer is the secondary antibody. 5. The final step is that a substrate is added that interacts with the label bound to the secondary antibody. The plate is then read in a spectrometer, which then gives a readout on the concentration. The result is inverse to the concentration. The more the well changes color, the lower the amount of analyte the patient has in his or her sample. The benefit of ELISA tests is that it does not take expensive equip- ment to run the test, which means that the test can be done for a lower cost. An additional benefit is that many different analytes can be mea- sured if specific antibodies can be developed. There are also several drawbacks to ELISA testing. First, there are more opportunities for interferences to influence the results, causing results to be either higher or lower than what is truly in the sample. Second, it is harder to moni- tor multiple analytes because each analyte requires its own well. Third, the dynamic range for ELISA tests is inherently limited, which causes the test to be more qualitative and less quantitative. This prevents the practitioner from receiving truly quantitative results.

## Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS

The introduction of LC-MS/MS has allowed the quantitative measure of many different chemicals. These measurements can be done on compounds either individually or simultaneously if the compounds have similar molecular characteristics. A mass spectrometer is a device that measures the molecular mass of compounds. Many different fields have used this technology, and two of the most common are drug testing and chemical exposure testing, which both need the sen- sitivity and selectiveness that LC-MS/MS provides.82 Over the past years, LC-MS/MS has become the gold standard for the measurement of mycotoxins.83 There are three parts involved in preparation and analysis with LC-MS/MS: extraction of the samples before injection, separation on a column, and fragmentation in the mass spectrometric detector. Proper sample preparation is a critical step for accurate measure- ment of most molecules using LC-MS/MS. There are three methods used by laboratory professionals to separate the mycotoxin analytes away from the contaminates that can interfere with the analysis. These methods include liquid-liquid extraction (LLE); solid-liquid extraction (SLE); salting-out liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE); the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method; and the dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction method (DLLME). Each of these methods has different benefits; however, the goal of each is to separate the analytes of interest away from matrix interferences and to concentrate the sample.83 After the samples are prepped, they must be injected into the LC-MS/MS. The samples are then transported through a separation column by a combination of solvent and water. There are multiple solvents that a laboratory can use, and the ratio of solvent to aque- ous can also vary between preparation techniques. Common solvents include acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, hexane, and ethyl acetate. The columns, which are labeled ultra-performance liquid chroma- tography (UPLC) columns, can also vary between protocols. Most protocols use C18 reverse-phase columns, which consists of strands of 18 carbon molecules packed into a column, usually between to 150 mm in length. However, there are many different varieties of columns, which vary in their dimensions as well as the packing mate- rial. These differences in packing material can alter how quickly the sample will transverse through the column and then enter the mass spectrometer.84 Once the analytes enter the mass spectrometer, they are processed in two stages. In the first stage, molecules are ionized by electrospray ionization (ESI).85 The instrument determines the mass-to-charge (m/z) spectra of the parent ions, which yields the mass of the mole- cule being analyzed. These molecules are then fragmented in a process called collision-induced dissociation (CID). In CID, an energized mol- ecule collides with a buffer gas, which causes the molecule’s bonds to break into predictable patterns. These patterns can be interpreted like a molecular fingerprint.86 When molecules are fragmented with LC-MS/ MS, they give a repeatable pattern, which can be used to properly iden- tify molecules (Fig. 138.3). With this ability to have great specificity in distinguishing between different molecules, mass spectrometry pro- vides both laboratory professionals and health care practitioners great assurance that their data are correct.

## Avoidance and Remediation

Mycotoxin and fungi exposure can lead to many different symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, difficulty breathing, rashes, gastrointesti- nal issues, joint pain, decreased libido, and more. As previously men- tioned, these mycotoxins can come from water-damaged buildings or

from food contamination. The most important element for treatment is the avoidance of further exposure to water-damaged environments as well as contaminated foods. Using a licensed company to inspect and remediate the area is recommended. Remediation of contaminated areas is difficult because heat, ultraviolet (UV) light, bleach, ammonia, and ozone do not completely remove mold from contaminated areas.87 Air spore counts are frequently done; however, they are usually done over a short period of time and often result in false-negative results. Another problem is that killing the mold does not eliminate the risk because mycotoxins will remain in the environment.

## Mycotoxin Excretion and Detoxification

Patients exposed to mycotoxins from mold may have two different conditions to treat. The first is the mycotoxin exposure, which can cause problems in many different tissues mentioned previously, and second is a possible infection and colonization of the fungi. To detox- ify the mycotoxins, it is recommended to use a combination of gluta- thione, sauna, sequestering/binding agents, and antioxidants. Patients may also need to treat fungal infections and colonization. Detoxification of many mycotoxins is dependent on the endog- enous molecule glutathione (GSH). For example, deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced by certain Fusarium species that fre- quently infect corn, wheat, oats, barley, and rice, which can be detoxi- fied when glutathione-S-transferase forms a conjugant with GSH and DON (Fig. 138.4). GSH is a tripeptide, which is made of glycine, cys- teine, and glutamate. Mycotoxin toxicity is intensified in patients with glutathione transferase mutations (GSTP1 and GSTM).88 GSH can be introduced in several ways, including treating with GSH precursors such as N-acetyl cysteine and whey protein or with an oral liposomal, transdermal, intravenous, nebulized, or intranasal form of GSH. It is recommended to use GSH with sequestering agents because treatment with GSH has been shown to increase the mobilization of mycotoxins in the bloodstream.89 Sauna therapy has been used for centuries for the removal of toxins from the body. Some of the most commonly used saunas are dry-heat radiant saunas and far-infrared saunas. Both have been shown to be equally as good at removing toxins from the body. Infrared saunas have the advantage of inducing sweating at lower body temperatures. Sweating is important because many mycotoxins are lipophilic and can bind to lipid proteins, which will allow the mycotoxins to persist in the body for extended periods of time.90 The use of sauna has two benefits pertaining to detoxification of mycotoxins. First, it breaks the bonds between mycotoxins and lipids in the body, increasing the circula- tion of mycotoxins; and second, it provides a second excretion route because several mycotoxins have been found in human sweat.91 One study of 28 individuals who had been exposed to mycotoxins included a regimen of sauna, exercise, and physical therapy. In this study, all individuals experienced significant improvement.92 Because both GSH treatment and sauna therapy increase the num- ber of mycotoxins in the bloodstream, it is important to use seques- tering agents in the treatment of mycotoxins. Many of these agents have shown efficacy in lowering mycotoxin levels. The most com- mon sequestering agents used are activated charcoal, cholestyramine, clay, and chlorophyll. Activated charcoal has been used for about two decades in the treatment of mycotoxins. Multiple studies have vali- dated the use of activated charcoal because of its high affinity for many different types of mycotoxins.93–95 Cholestyramine (CSM) is an anion exchange resin that works as a bile-acid–sequestering agent. Multiple studies have demonstrated that CSM treatment leads to a reduction of ochratoxin levels in the plasma and urine and increases the fecal excre- tion. CSM has also been shown to be safely tolerated in children.96,97


One additional component of treatment that is necessary is the addi- tion of antioxidant support. Mycotoxins exposure induces oxidative stress and cell as cellular DNA damage; however, antioxidants have been shown to decrease these effects.

C, and E were shown to have better outcomes.98 Another antioxidant that has been shown to cause significant hepatoprotective activity is curcumin. In a rat study, rats that were exposed to aflatoxin B1 and treated with curcumin had significantly lower serum enzyme mark- ers and higher levels of reduced glutathione, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.99

## Fungal Treatment

Patients who have high levels of mycotoxins in their bodies may also be suffering from fungal infections and colonization. This is usually caused by direct exposure to elevated levels of mold spores. Fungal infections can occur in many different parts of the body. The most common areas of infection are the sinus cavities, lungs, and intes- tine. One Mayo Clinic study found fungal growth in 96% of patients with chronic sinusitis. The types of mold found included Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium, and Cryptococcus. All of these molds are known to produce mycotoxins and cause sig- nificant diseases.100,101 One study demonstrated that antifungal drug therapies were useful in combating microbial pathogens detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.102 Another recent study compared organic acid results from patients who had positive results on an LC-MS/MS mycotoxin with control subjects. This study demon- strated that certain markers are more elevated in patients who have been exposed to mycotoxins.103 The two categories of markers that were most pronounced were fungal markers and mitochondrial mark- ers (Fig. 138.5). The two fungal markers that were significant were 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furioc and Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic, which are both fungal metabolites.104,105 These data indicate that certain organic acid tests that measure these markers may be helpful in diagnosing fungal infections.

The first—and perhaps the most important—pathway used for the detoxifying of deoxynivalenol (DON) is cytochrome P450, which serves to catalyze the oxidation of organic substances. This pathway, however, can cause free hydroxyl groups of DON to be cleaved, producing DON-radical, which can be more dangerous. The DON-radical can be scavenged by enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase [GPx], catalase, superoxide dismutase) or nonenzymatic (reduced glutathione [GSH], metallothionein [MT], and vitamins) processes. Nevertheless, cytochrome P450 can be followed by Phase II, in which glutathione-S-transferase can form a conjugant with GSH and DON, which results in detoxification of the xenobiotic.

Treatment for fungal infections may involve several steps. The first step should be the avoidance of elevated spore counts and particulates through proper remediation and air filters. Second, antifungal medi- cations have been shown to be efficacious. Multiple studies have used amphotericin B for the treatment of fungal infections.106–108 Other antifungals that have been used include ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole. For intestinal fungal infections, nystatin or liposomal nystatin may be a good alternative.109,110


Mycotoxin and fungal exposure can lead to many chronic illnesses, includ- ing fatigue, headaches, rashes, pulmonary infections, and even cancer. Mycotoxin exposure may also lead to many other coinfections because of the mycotoxins’ abilities to impair immune system function. Because the concentrations of mycotoxin metabolites in human patients are quite low, testing has moved away from ELISA to the more sophisticated and sensitive LC-MS/MS technology. Treatment plans for patients exposed to mycotoxins that have been the most efficacious have been multifactorial, including binders, sauna, glutathione, antioxidants, and sometimes anti- fungal therapies. Treatment plans can take anywhere from a few months to a year to have sufficient removal of the toxins. However, most patients show significant improvements after removal of the mycotoxins.

## 1036SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

favorable changes in body composition as well as blood lipid/lipopro- tein and glucose levels,6 there is mixed support for its use in improving athletic performance. Daily carbohydrate intake, and to some extent the protein intake, have to be monitored closely so that the body can keto-adapt, typi- cally requiring carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams daily. By keto-adapting, ketones become the body’s main fuel source over glu- cose. Once the body keto-adapts or goes into nutritional ketosis, it is forced to start burning fat from the diet and/or from the fat stored in the body via beta-oxidation. High protein intake may make it difficult to put the body into nutritional ketosis, which is due to the glucone- ogenic effect of excess protein but also due to the increased supply of oxaloacetate (OAA) from dietary protein, where OAA is the key limit- ing substrate for the Krebs cycle. Conversely, insufficient protein while in ketosis may affect long-term athletic performance. Furthermore, a keto diet can easily become hypercaloric given the high caloric density of high-fat, low-carbohydrate foods, thus affecting caloric balance and weight loss. This balancing act of hitting the right macronutrient ratio needs to be individualized and carefully monitored; otherwise, it may mean the difference between weight loss and improved performance or fat gain and fatigue. The paucity of studies on the ketogenic diet in terms of ergogenic effects seem to have mixed results, which may explain the limited research. However, some of the research on ketogenic diet and improv- ing athletic performance is intriguing. From a biochemical standpoint, it seems to make sense, at least for endurance athletes, that a more efficient fuel source would be fat instead of carbohydrates. For years, the thought has been that carbohydrate loading for endurance athletes enhances performance. Indeed, some studies support this approach.7 However, some of the research on the ketogenic diet contradicts this notion. Thus far, studies of competitive athletes seem to show that this diet does not adversely affect aerobic endurance8,9 and explosive strength10 and may help with body composition.11–13 However, as yet, there is no consensus on their efficacy in improving performance, and some studies show negative effects of very low-carb diets in athletes.14

## Intermittent Fasting

Another intriguing trend that is becoming more prevalent for losing weight, improving health, and enhancing athletic performance among both athletes and the general public is intermittent fasting (IF). Some fitness enthusiasts think IF is a useful tool for losing excess fat weight while simultaneously helping preserve lean body mass.15,16 Short- duration IF of 8 to 48 hours enhances fat burning without causing the rebound weight-gain effects of long-term energy restriction (e.g., the “eat less, exercise more” dogma). Because IF is voluntary as opposed to involuntary fasting (i.e., as in famines, starvation, and long-term diet- ing), the stress of short-term fasting seems to have significant benefit for the athlete and average person who needs to lose excess weight, the main one being improved compliance. Also, IF and the ketogenic diet seem to potentiate one another in regard to ease of implementation and keto-adapting.17 IF is one way for the average person to lower elevated insulin levels quickly, thus enabling fat burning.18,19 The less insulin in the body, the better one is able to burn fat. Just adding more time without eating between meals over time will help improve insulin sensitivity. Also, high insulin levels tend to cause the kidneys to retain sodium, and thus result in water retention. Becoming more insulin sensitive helps the body shed excess water, which is one of the first signs that a person is less resistant to insulin and that fat burning is beginning to happen. There are many myths about IF that are not borne out in the research, because many of the studies are done on complete fasting (some with individuals who were even foregoing water) and long-term caloric restriction. IF is very different physiologically from starvation or long-term energy deficient states. Some of the more common mis- conceptions are the following: • IF causes muscle loss. • IF causes fatigue, irritability, and low energy. • IF causes athletic performance to suffer. Although it may be true that fasting more than 24 hours can cause athletic performance to be compromised in some individuals, and much longer fasts (longer than 72 hours) can cause muscle loss and poor mood, IF for less than 24 hours typically will not have such results and may even improve performance, depending on the sport. In addi- tion, the notion that short-term fasting causes muscle loss or fat gain, or low energy, poor moods, and compromised focus simply is, as of yet, unfounded. In fact, the opposite may be true.20 From an ancient ancestral perspective, our species endured numer- ous periods of feast and famine. If they had not adapted to that forced intermittent fasting, our species, as we know it, would not have sur- vived. Those experiences primed our ancient ancestors and us to pre- serve our muscle mass and brain function during times of food scarcity so that we would have the energy level and focus to find food. This process occurs because the body has an alternative fuel source like ketones, which result from burning fat. Keto-adaptation (nutritional ketosis) helps preserve muscle mass, energy levels, and brain function so that food can be pursued and found.21 If the famine continues too long, then starvation ketosis sets in, and muscle mass, energy levels, and eventually focus suffer. The benefits of IF over conventional weight loss recommendations are that it seems to increase compliance,22 improve health,23 and pos- sibly improve performance24 and mental focus.25 Much more study is needed, but thus far, IF seems to have many health benefits over long- term energy restriction for fat loss and may improve athletes’ perfor- mance if done intermittently for short periods of time while ensuring the unique needs of the athlete are met.

## Diet Concerns for Athletes

Nutrition for exercise performance involves fueling the body for per- formance. This process requires optimal energy resources to make up for caloric expenditure during exercise. Athletic activities can use sig- nificant resources. High-intensity daily exercise can burn from 600 to 1200 calories/day.26–28 Elite athletes, such as professional cyclists, can burn as many as 12,000 calories/day, necessitating a large compensa- tory calorie intake. Caloric needs this high can be extremely difficult to obtain through “real” food alone.26–31 This difficulty makes supple- mentation of functional foods and supplements necessary for athletes undergoing heavy training. Health care providers advising athletes on nutrition must take many factors into account. In addition to the caloric issues just described, there are several other issues. Many athletes undergoing the intense stress of training can experience loss of appetite, especially after intense exercise.32 Athletes are often also under the constraints of tight schedules of competition and travel requirements, which can prevent or interrupt scheduled meals. Given the already tight training schedules, athletes can quickly become overwhelmed by food consid- erations. Another potential problem may be lack of variety in the diet, which can lead to lack of enjoyment in eating and loss of appetite. To address these issues, athletes engaged in heavy training should work to ensure muscle is not lost and weight is maintained, which means eating calorie-dense meals and snacks that are convenient for an athlete’s lifestyle. Although real and whole foods should be empha- sized, the use of protein bars, meal-replacement shakes, electrolyte beverages, and nutritional vitamin and mineral supplements will often be needed. Ideally, athletes involved in intense training should eat

between four and six meals per day and should eat in consistently timed intervals. Meal and snack timing around training is also an important consideration to replenish energy and aid recovery.32 Athletes should understand that without calorie balance, many supportive training aids will not provide much advantage. Maintaining caloric needs is the foundation on which all other ergogenic aids should be built.

## Macronutrient Ratios

In addition to the caloric considerations of athletes, balancing the pro- tein, fat, and carbohydrate ratio is also important. Recreationally active individuals are usually advised to consume from 45% to 55% carbo- hydrates, 10% to 15% protein, and 25% to 35% fat.26–28 The macro- nutrient needs of athletes can far exceed these numbers. Carbohydrate requirements for athletes can increase up to 10% to replenish and maximize liver and muscle glycogen storage.27,28 These carbohydrates should come from low-glycemic-index sources that do not cause rapid fluctuations in blood glucose. Because higher levels of complex, low-glycemic carbohydrates can be hard to consume, fruit juices, energy bars, and other convenience foods may be considered. Research related to carbohydrate intake in athletes shows that ath- letes may reach what is called a “carbohydrate tipping point.”27 This point is a level of carbohydrate beyond which there ceases to be a per- formance advantage. Research suggests the body can burn 1 to 1.1 g of carbohydrate per minute, amounting to roughly 60 g of carbohydrate per hour of exercise.27 Harger-Domitrovich et al.33 showed approx- imately 50 g of carbohydrate for a 165-lb individual was the optimal intake of carbohydrates for athletes. This intake amounts to 0.27 g of carbohydrate needed per pound of body weight each hour during exercise. It is also interesting to note that not all carbohydrates are created equal. Research suggests that sugars composed mainly of glucose (malt- ose, maltodextrin, and other polysaccharides) are burned at a higher rate in comparison with nonglucose sugar (fructose, galactose, etc.). The combination of these sugars seems to be most advantageous.27 Evaluating carbohydrate sources on the relative ratios of these sugars may be wise. The glucose/fructose ratio of close to 1:1 seems optimal.

## Protein

Protein is an essential nutrient for all humans but especially so for ath- letes. Recent research on protein intake has shown that athletes require two times or more of the reference daily intake.27,34–39 It is now recom- mended that athletes involved in very high-volume training catabolize between 0.7 and 0.9 g of protein per pound of body weight per day. This amounts to between 115 and 150 g of protein per day for a 165- lb athlete. Lean proteins sources such as chicken breast, fish, and lean meats provide approximately 25 g of protein per 3-oz serving; there- fore athletes benefit most from consuming approximately 5 to 7 oz of these lean protein sources per day. This amount would be the equiva- lent of about five to seven 3-oz servings of chicken, fish, or other lean protein per day, with the assumption of fats and carbohydrates to be negligible in lean protein sources. Protein considerations are especially important for endurance athletes, who are more susceptible to protein malnutrition due to the catabolic hormonal environment created by their sport.39–41 Like carbohydrates, not all protein is the same. The amino acid con- tent of protein sources varies and has direct bearing on quality. Different types of protein can be described as fast proteins or slow proteins.42,43 Slow proteins are digested more evenly and take longer to process. Fast proteins are digested more rapidly and allow amino acids to be quickly available to the body. The typical fast- and slow-protein sources are whey and casein, respectively. Health care providers working with athletes may want to look at slow proteins as good meal options, whereas fast protein may be great options to aid performance and recovery by timing them for intake before and after exercise. The best sources of protein are low fat and have a high biological value with optimal amino acid ratios. These sources include skinless chicken, lean beef, fish, egg whites, skim milk, lean pork, and the supplemental milk proteins casein and whey. The International Society of Sports Nutrition published its position on protein intake in 2017, highlighting the following points44,45: 1. Highly active individuals should consume between 1.4 and 2 g of protein per kilogram of body weight. 2. Higher protein intakes (2.3–3.1 g/kg/day) may be needed to main- tain lean body mass in resistance-trained athletes following a hypo- caloric regime. 3. Concern that protein intake within this range is unhealthy is unfounded. 4. Attempts should be made to get protein from whole foods, but sup- plemental protein is a safe and viable method of protein intake. 5. Timing protein intake before and after exercise may have benefits, including enhanced recovery and development of muscle mass. 6. Certain amino acids, such as leucine, a branched chain amino acid (BCAA), have been shown to be beneficial for increasing the rate of protein synthesis, decreasing protein breakdown, and increasing recovery from exercise.46 Exercising individuals require more protein than their sedentary counterparts require.

## Fat

Fat intake for athletes involves several important considerations and depends on an athlete’s goals and training state. In general, athletes’ fat recommendations should be at or slightly greater than those for their nonathlete sedentary counterparts.27,34 High-volume athletic training has been shown to lower testosterone concentrations, and decreasing fat intake can exacerbate this effect.47–49 Most research suggests athletes should keep their dietary fat intake at around 30% of total calories. However, ultraendurance athletes, in particular, may go much higher than this. Athletes undergoing very intense training regimes have been shown to safely tolerate and benefit from diets containing as much as 50% of total calories from fat.50 As mentioned previously, weight loss is occasionally a concern for athletes. In those cases, a lower-fat diet may be advisable, with research suggesting a diet of 0.25 to 0.5 g of fat per pound per day.51 Fat quality is also a concern. The polyunsatu- rated fatty acid ratio of ω -6/ ω -3 may be a concern in immune system function and inflammatory responses. Saturated fat intake may also be associated with more optimal testosterone responses.49 Given these considerations of fat and the emerging understanding of the differ- ent function of fats, it is wise for athletes to consume a wide range of dietary fats, with a special focus on balancing the ω -3/ ω -6 ratio. International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: nutrient timing Prolonged exercise (>60–90 min) of moderate-to high-intensity exercise will deplete the internal stores of energy, & prudent timing of nutrient delivery can help offset these changes. During intense exercise, regular consumption (10–15 fl oz.) of a carbohy- drate/electrolyte solution delivering 6%–8% CHO (6–8 g CHO/100 ml fluid) should be consumed every 15–20 minutes to sustain blood glucose levels. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and other high-glycemic CHO sources are easily digested, but fructose consumption should be minimized as it is absorbed at a slower rate and increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal problems.

## Performance, Recovery, and Nutrient Timing

Athletes and those working with them can benefit greatly from under- standing how to time meals for performance and recovery. When it comes to performance nutrition, it is useful to think about first maxi- mizing storage capacity (i.e., filling the liver and muscle glycogen stores) and fueling exercise (i.e., having nutrients more recently consumed to fuel exercise).26–28,46 Complex carbohydrates take about 4 to 6 hours to be digested, absorbed, and then stored in the liver and muscle as gly- cogen.26–28,46,52 Recommendations regarding carbohydrate loading for training and competition should take that time into account. Morning training sessions or competition will benefit from nighttime loading strategies, whereas afternoon competition and training sessions will benefit from morning loading strategies. A light carbohydrate and pro- tein shake roughly 45 minutes (30–60 minutes) before activity has been shown to improve performance toward the end of high-intensity activ- ity. The inclusion of protein also serves to spare muscle tissue by decreas- ing the need for the body to cannibalize its own muscle tissue.53,54 Although exercise sessions of less than an hour require no special nutritional or hydration strategies, exercise sessions lasting longer do. Strategies that manage pre-, post-, and within-workout nutritional requirements can dramatically aid performance and recovery. This is where electrolyte solutions and sports drinks consumed before and during exercise have an important role to play. These beverages can help prevent low blood sugar, optimize hydration, replace lost min- erals, and reduce the immune suppression that occurs after intense long-duration exercise.55,56 A carbohydrate beverage of 6% to 8% with an equal mixture of glucose and fructose taken every 20 minutes during exercise is advised.27,54,57 In addition, adding protein to car- bohydrate intake may result in higher rates of glycogen storage after exercise.32,55,57,58 Research suggests consumption of approximately g of a rich source of essential amino acids (e.g., whey protein) com- bined with 40 g of a good glucose source (e.g., grape juice) taken minutes before exercise may be useful and within 3 hours after exercise may improve performance and aid recovery. The addition of a small amount of fat may also be helpful in stabilizing blood glucose levels.57 After exercise, there is a unique opportunity to fuel the body for recovery. During this “recovery phase,” nutritional strategies should be instituted as soon as possible and at least within the first 30 minutes after the cessation of exercise. A mixed carbohydrate–protein bever- age containing close to a 3:1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein within hours after exercise appears to provide greater recovery benefits than do lesser amounts of carbohydrate.32,55,57–59 Upon completion of this postworkout “snack,” another more carbohydrate-heavy postworkout meal should be eaten again within 90 minutes. Most athletes will taper their training by one third to one half 2 to 5 days before their events. During that time, it may be beneficial to consume 200 to 300 extra grams of carbohydrates daily. This technique has been shown to maximize glycogen storage before the event and improve performance.57

## Water

Easily the most beneficial ergogenic aid is water. Working to prevent dehydration during exercise is one of the most useful endeavors for improving exercise performance. Intense exercise can result in sig- nificant loss of water through sweat. When this fluid is not replaced, athletic performance will suffer. A loss of 2% water through sweat can impair the ability to compete, and a loss of 4% can result in the inabil- ity of the body to cool itself during exercise.56 Athletes can lose 1 to L in sweat through exercise per hour. Unfortunately, athletes cannot rely on thirst perception to regulate fluid balance.56 There are several objective ways for athletes to measure fluid loss.56 One way to ensure adequate hydration recovery is for athletes to weigh themselves before and after exercise and drink 3 cups of liquids per pound of weight lost through exercise. During heavy exercise, athletes should consume 1 to 2 L of water or glucose and/or electrolyte beverage per hour.56,60

## Vitamins and Minerals

It is now recommended by most medical organizations that a low-dose multivitamin be consumed daily to assure optimal vitamin and min- eral status.27,61 Few, if any, vitamins and minerals have been shown conclusively in research to have any performance benefit. However, the nutritional status of an athlete can affect quality of performance, training, and recovery.27,61–64 When considering vitamin and mineral supplementation for athletes, health care practitioners should view their recommendations in the context of nutrient adequacy. Athletes may be more susceptible to vitamin and mineral inadequacies, given the previously mentioned issues on nutrition and potential caloric deficits. Although there may be no direct benefits to performance, many vitamins and minerals aid recovery and support.27,61–64 Vitamin C and zinc in particular have good research suggesting immune enhancement during intense training periods.27 Vitamins C and E, along with other antioxidant nutrients, may also protect athletes from excessive oxidative damage, which could also lead to immune suppression.27 Mineral deficiencies are particularly problematic for athletes. Restoring any mineral deficiencies can aid performance.27 Certain minerals may also provide benefit for optimizing performance. Calcium is one mineral that can aid athletes. Although there is no evidence that calcium supplementation improves performance, at supplement levels of approximately 1000 mg per day, calcium has been shown to assist athletes susceptible to osteoporosis as well as improve body composition.65,66 Phosphorus supplementation may have ergogenic effects when supplemented as sodium phosphate but not in other forms (calcium phosphate, potassium phosphate, etc.).67 Levels of supplementation for phosphate are 4000 mg/day (1 g tribasic CHO, Carbohydrate; PRO, Protein.

dodecahydrate sodium phosphate 4 times/day) for 3 days for endur- ance improvement. Sodium intake has benefit for training in the heat and reduces the risk of hyponatremia.48 With most minerals, as with vitamins, the real benefit to athletes comes when identified deficiencies are corrected. Restoring vitamin and mineral status to optimal levels can aid exercise performance.7,41-44 Along these lines, vitamin D is a special consideration. Vitamin D deficiency is now epidemic, and athletes have the same rates of defi- ciency as the rest of the public have.68,69 In one study of elite female gymnasts, 77% were found to have vitamin D levels lower than 35 ng/ mL, and a full third had levels lower than 10 ng/mL (which is defined as a clinical deficiency).69 In a group of athletes susceptible to prolonged and constant bone stress (i.e., long-distance runners), this finding was especially troubling and underscores the need for athletes to ensure adequate vitamin D status. Although vitamin D supplementation in individuals with sufficient vitamin D does not appear to increase performance, vitamin D therapy delivered to deficient athletes may improve performance.69,70 Vitamin D is known for its role in bone metabolism. However, the fact that skeletal muscle has vitamin D receptors is not commonly known. As far back as the 1930s, there have been numerous reports of the ben- eficial effects of ultraviolet therapy on athletic performance.71,72 In addition, some studies suggest the season of training makes a differ- ence. One of these studies showed that training in the summer months creates greater gains than the same volume of training in autumn or winter does, despite the same stimulus.72 In both older and younger individuals, adequate vitamin D status affects neuromuscular function and may have a specific relationship to the maintenance of the fast-twitch type 2 muscle fibers.68,71,73,74 In a study on teenage athletes, vitamin D deficiency lowered muscle power and force.75 Vitamin D levels are also related to myalgia, fatigue, and reduced motivation to exercise. Studies in older adults showed that levels of vitamin D were correlated with the propensity to fall.76 A meta-analysis of vitamin D levels showed a 20% reduction in the risk of falling among people with higher levels.77 This reduction was likely due to vitamin D’s ability to improve reaction speed, balance, and neu- romuscular performance. Much of this effect may be explained by the ability of vitamin D to help maintain and even build type 2 muscle fibers. Athletes should be tested for vitamin D levels with a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D laboratory test with a target between 50 and 100 ng/mL. If they are found to be insufficient, a combination of sup- plementation and sun exposure is advisable. For quick restoration of adequate vitamin D levels, 50,000 International Units (IUs) of vitamin D per week for 12 weeks has been shown to allay symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Maintenance doses of between 1000 and 10,000 IU/day, depending on sun exposure and living latitude, should also be consid- ered to prevent subclinical and clinical deficiencies.

## Serum Nutrient Testing

Nutrient deficiencies can affect many aspects of physical performance, recovery, and immune function. Athletes, because of the imposed increases in metabolism, can be at an increased risk for nutrient deficiencies. Serum testing is a reliable and useful tool for diagnosis of severe nutrient defi- ciencies but may be inadequate for certain vitamins and minerals.78 Therefore those working with athletes will find it useful to have more functional tools for assessment of metabolic and nutritional needs. Testing blood for nutritional levels can be misleading. Serum nutri- ent concentrations are closely regulated by the body and can fluctuate based on recent intake. Furthermore, some vitamins and minerals are almost entirely found intracellularly. As stated by Lord and Bralley in their textbook Laboratory Evaluations for Integrative and Functional Medicine, “For various reasons specific to each vitamin, it is possible for an individual to have normal serum levels of a vitamin while exhib- iting signs of insufficiency for that vitamin owing to a lack of adequate intracellular concentration to meet the metabolic demands of the cells.”78 Given these factors, serum may not always be the best means of determining nutritional status for all nutrients. A range of laboratory analyses that can provide more functional assessments of nutrition sta- tus are now available.78 The ones that may be most beneficial are adre- nal hormone profiles (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]), organic acid testing, and intracellular nutrient analysis.

## Adrenal Hormone Testing

Analyzing the adrenal hormones cortisol and DHEA can give insight into training status and into whether an athlete may be overtraining or overreaching.79–81 Salivary cortisol and DHEA levels provide an indica- tion of catabolic versus anabolic balance in the body as well as neuro- endocrine adaptation to stress. The optimal ratio of salivary cortisol to DHEA is approximately 5:1 to 6:1, which indicates an appropriate state of stress adaptation. The closer this ratio is to 1:1, the less likely it is for the individual to be able to adapt to daily stressors.82 The test is sim- ple and noninvasive, involving salivary collection at four time points during the day (morning, noon, evening, and night). Depending on the laboratory, the cortisol and DHEA test may also provide markers of immune function, such as immunoglobulin-A. All these measures are important for athletes looking to compete at high levels for prolonged periods. The body goes through four stages in response to stress. Stage occurs in response to acute stress and involves elevations in corti- sol with no changes in DHEA. Stage 2 involves continued stress and is marked by a sustained cortisol peak with a matching elevation of DHEA. At stage 3, when stress continues and becomes chronic, cor- tisol levels drop, whereas DHEA stays high. Finally, both cortisol and DHEA fall, a stage often referred to as adrenal exhaustion or stage 4. Testing athletes for levels of adrenal hormones gives import- ant guidance concerning nutritional therapy and supplementation. Cortisol is a highly catabolic agent, and increased cortisol levels with normal to low DHEA indicate excessive stress and potential muscle wasting.78 This status necessitates increased protein and amino acid intake, especially increased glutamine.83 High cortisol levels also give an indication of increased need for other nutrients that are easily depleted through increased metabolic activity (e.g., magnesium, zinc, and vitamin B 6 ).78 Cortisol-suppressing supplements, such as phos- phatidylserine, may also be indicated,84 as is the potential for DHEA supplementation and/or immune support.85 Changes in adrenal hor- mones may occur long before clinical symptoms appear and can be used to monitor training status and recovery.

## Organic Acid Testing

Organic acid testing is a useful analysis that looks at metabolic by-prod- ucts in urine.78 The test does not measure actual vitamins and miner- als or their absolute values but assesses them indirectly by measuring excreted metabolic by-products. Although the test is not diagnostic, it can be used to analyze the metabolic consequences of insufficient nutrient intake. It can also offer insights into toxic exposures, digestive health, amino acid need, and neuroendocrine function. Fats, proteins, and carbohydrates become carboxylic acids before they are completely burned to carbon dioxide. These acids, formed by the body’s metabolic processes, are usually low or nonexistent in urine. When perturbations occur in metabolism due to inefficient enzymes as a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or lack of a vitamin or min- eral cofactor, the metabolic by-products can build up in the cell, be

## 1040SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

released into the blood, and then begin to show up in the urine. The organic acids that appear can then be traced back to known biochemi- cal pathways, indicating a particular nutrient need. Given the fact that almost all nutrients become ergogenic when there is a deficiency or increased need, organic acid testing may be use- ful in understanding which nutrients may be indicated for a particu- lar athlete and whether the supplements they are currently taking are actually doing the job. Using organic acid testing may provide health care practitioners working with athletes a way to pinpoint potential nutrient issues and bolster key metabolic pathways.

## Intracellular Nutrient Analysis

Because many nutrients, like magnesium, are not well measured in serum, another useful functional analysis for athletes is intracellular nutrient analysis.78 This testing involves drawing blood, isolating white blood cells, and growing them in a nutrient-rich medium. Individual nutrient concentrations are then manipulated one by one while mea- suring cell growth rates. Cellular growth from an athlete with insuf- ficient levels of a nutrient will be slower than from an athlete with sufficient levels.86 This analysis allows tailored nutrient supplementa- tion to optimize intracellular levels of all nutrients.

## Amino Acid Testing

Due to the high turnover of amino acids required in the participation and recovery from intense exercise, amino acid analysis can be useful for athletes.78,87 When testing athletes for amino acids, it may be useful to measure plasma levels, urine levels, and organic acids. Plasma levels give the best indication of protein utilization and are the most scientif- ically validated. However, urinary amino acids may give greater insight into protein breakdown from factors interfering with amino acid uti- lization (i.e., micronutrient deficiency or toxic exposures). These two measures, along with the ability to map biochemical pathways through organic acid testing, can provide an athlete with in-depth information about protein utilization, breakdown, and metabolic needs.

# CRITICAL EVALUATION OF ERGOGENIC AIDS

It is important for the health care practitioner to be aware of the large gap that often exists between supplement marketing and research. Given that nutritional supplements are not regulated to the same degree as pharmaceuticals, and little financial incentive exists to research natural compounds, it is important to look for valid and objective resources on nutritional supplements. When evaluating whether a nutraceutical might be useful, it is important to keep several things in mind.27 A good first question to ask is, “Does the basic science make sense?” Natural health practitioners need to be good students of biochemis- try and physiology. Knowing the compound and its involvement in biochemical pathways is a necessary first step. If the mechanism of action “makes sense” from a biochemical perspective, the supplemen- tal aid may have merit. A good example here is the use of the nutrient l-carnitine. Understanding the biochemistry of this nutrient as key in delivering fat to the mitochondria to be burned for energy allows con- sideration that it may have fat loss and performance benefits. The next question must be, “Is it feasible to deliver the nutrient in a form that can actually be absorbed and utilized by the body?” Although a nutrient may seem like a perfect candidate for perfor- mance enhancement properties, if it cannot be delivered to the body in a safe, feasible, and usable form, it will not have much use. In the case of l-carnitine, several issues warrant consideration. First, l-carni- tine is not well absorbed; therefore understanding the different deliv- ery forms is essential. The next obvious question, “Would l-carnitine bound to tartrate, fumarate, or another molecule be most feasible for delivery?” Also, in the case of amino acids like carnitine, there are two forms, l-carnitine and d-carnitine. l-carnitine is active in the body, whereas d-carnitine is not and can actually block the action of l-carni- tine. Confidence would therefore be less on studies using the racemic mixture of this nutrient versus those using pure l-carnitine. Another important consideration is, “Does any good research exist on the substance?” Health care practitioners should further consider other aspects: Are the studies in vitro or in vivo studies? Were they animal or human studies? Was the sample size big enough? Was the study designed appropriately? Was it well controlled? Human clini- cal trials with a large sample size that are double-blinded and place- bo-controlled are obviously the gold standard and should be weighted heavier. However, these types of studies often do not exist for sports performance supplements, accounting for much of the skepticism regarding sports performance aids. Moreover, these types of studies are cost-prohibitive, especially when considering the diminutive financial gain, if any at all, of doing natural compound studies because there is essentially no patent protection. Much of this skepticism is warranted, although discounting a supplement purely on the basis of lack of these types of trials is probably not wise. Some final considerations would be whether or not the product is safe, legal, and appropriate. In 2006 the 109th Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Act. This law requires supplement companies to disclose all complaints about their products and make them available to the public. For supplement issues that are more serious in nature, the companies must notify the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within a 2-week time frame. There are also consumer organizations that help police the industry. These organizations independently test supplement products against claims of efficacy and issues with contamination, and such groups can be useful resources to those advising supplement use. Finally, there are always completely safe products that may present issues in certain populations. All these considerations should be evaluated when using nutritional supplementation.

# GENERAL HEALTH CONCERNS FOR ATHLETES

The American Medical Association has suggested Americans use sup- plemental vitamins to maintain health; these recommendations seem especially prudent in the athletic world. Although there is no perfor- mance benefit to the use of multiple vitamins and minerals, as dis- cussed previously, athletes can be susceptible to deficiencies and/or require more support in areas due to increased vulnerability to stress or injuries encountered during sports. Glucosamine can aid in the heal- ing of damaged cartilage and reduce joint pain.69 Supplements such as zinc, glutamine, vitamin C, lipoic acid, selenium, and other nutrients may support immune function and antioxidant capacity.26,27,46,88–90 Amino acids are especially useful. Creatine, whey protein, BCAAs, and l-carnitine tartrate have all been shown to help athletes through the stress of intense training periods.26,27,46 Finally, ω -3 fats can help bal- ance inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions in the body.

# NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS

Obviously, a full treatment of all the nutraceuticals purported to have beneficial effects in exercise and body composition could fill an entire book. We selected the compounds discussed here that demonstrated the most research supporting their use as ergogenic aids. We attempted to avoid looking at compounds that have strong theoretical support for their use but have not yet been studied. We gave special consider- ation to compounds that have been studied in humans and have been

evaluated under double-blinded and placebo-controlled conditions. Newer compounds that did not meet these criteria may not be cov- ered. In certain cases, we included compounds that are novel in their reported use as ergogenic substances.

## Arginine

Arginine has several potential benefits for athletes, including increas- ing human growth hormone production, blood flow, mitochondrial biogenesis, fat loss, and muscle gain. Many of these effects are related to nitric oxide, for which arginine is a precursor. However, several of these benefits are relatively new discoveries regarding arginine supplementation. Animal studies and human studies show arginine might have particular benefit in improving exercise capacity and body composition. Arginine may play a role in endurance performance. A 2010 study showed that a proprietary arginine supplement given to elderly male cyclists was able to positively affect performance. The arginine sup- plement significantly increased the anaerobic threshold within 1 week of beginning supplementation, with the effect lasting throughout the 3-week study.91 No change in maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) among the cyclists was found in this particular study. However, in another study, this time on younger cyclists, oxygen kinetics were sped up in relation to l-arginine supplementation.92 Another study in showed arginine’s potential role in illness associated with reduced cardiovascular capacity.93 In this analysis, arginine supplementation improved exercise capacity in heart transplantation patients, resulting in furthering the distance walked and delaying the ventilatory thresh- old by 1.2 minutes. In addition to endurance benefits, arginine may also have a role to play in strength training. An April 2010 study showed increased growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 release in response to heavy resistance training.94 This newer study lends credibility to older reports. Research on rats, pigs, and humans showed arginine to be a potential antiobesity aid through several unique mechanisms.95 Supplemental arginine appears to have activity that increases glucose and long-chain fatty acid oxidation while at the same time suppressing gluconeogen- esis and lipogenesis. In rats, l-arginine was shown to increase mus- cle mass by 12% and increase glucose metabolism by 14% without affecting insulin. Most interestingly, arginine was shown to coax white adipose tissue to become brown adipose tissue and, as a result, signifi- cantly elevated the metabolic rate. Arginine appears to act partly via its conversion to nitric oxide. It may act via cyclic guanosine monophos- phate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate dependent mechanisms. It was found to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulate GLUT-4 receptors, and improve muscle mass. A 21-day randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of arginine in obese men was conducted in 2006 by Lucotti et al.96 Thirty-three obese males were put on a low-calorie diet (1000 kcal/ day) and an exercise program (45 minutes of exercise twice per day for 5 days/week). They were then randomized to receive 8.3 g per day of arginine or placebo. As expected, the lifestyle intervention resulted in weight loss, waist circumference reduction, lowered fasting glucose, and reduced insulin in both groups. However, the arginine group had statistically better responses in most measures in comparison with the placebo group (P <0.0001). Most interestingly, the arginine group was able to maintain their muscle mass, whereas the placebo group had sig- nificant reduction in lean body mass. Forty-three percent of the weight lost in the placebo group was fat in comparison with a full 100% for the arginine group. Although earlier research shows the athletic performance benefits of l-arginine, more recent analyses suggest the ergogenic benefit is nonexistent to minimal at best. Using various doses of arginine, from 0.04 g/kg, 0.75 g/kg97 to absolute amounts of 6 g,98,99 with various forms, including arginine alpha-ketoglutarate to pure l-arginine, cre- ates a situation that makes it difficult to construct a valid comparative analysis. However, among these various studies, arginine showed no change in performance outcomes97 or only very slight improvements.99 Not to be ignored, many of the studies testing the efficacy of l-arginine on athletic performance are studying individuals under unique circum- stances, all with significant effect on performance. The variables among these studies are inconsistent with variation in supplement duration, combination of arginine with other agents,100 varying exercise protocols from aerobic endurance, high-intensity to combative sports,99 and the fitness level of the athlete (healthy men to highly trained athletes).97,98 Furthermore, their use of small sample sizes questions the power of the studies. However, this research is what the literature provides, which then requires a thorough analysis of the research as a whole, which must then be applied through the lens of the patient.


The appropriate dose of arginine based on the animal and human studies appears to be 80 mg/kg body weight per day, or 3 g three times daily for a 155-lb adult. Results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicated arginine intake in the United States averages about 4.4 g per day, with 25% of the population receiving suboptimal levels.95


Both animal and human studies suggest there are no safety concerns related to arginine supplementation when it is taken in appropriate doses and in an appropriate form. There is a theoretical concern that increased arginine supplementation will alter the arginine/lysine ratio and possibly increase herpes virus activity. Arginine is also known to increase the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase, resulting in poten- tial negative cytokine activity and immune consequences. This result is a special concern for those suffering from autoimmunity. Biochemically, an intricate relationship exists between citrulline and arginine in the synthesis of nitric oxide, as citrulline acts as a pre- cursor to arginine. Several studies have shown citrulline supplementa- tion at doses up to 6 g daily to improve arginine levels and NO levels in the blood superior to arginine alone.101–103 Although this can simply be attributed to citrulline being a precursor, thus increasing usable sub- strate, additional research further suggests arginine is catabolized via first-pass metabolism in the gut and liver by arginase. Citrulline does not undergo this process and further acts as an allosteric inhibitor of arginase, resulting in increased peripheral circulation of arginine, thus increasing available arginine as a substrate for NOS.103

## Beta-Alanine

Beta-alanine is a precursor, along with histidine, of carnosine and is found in high concentration in skeletal muscle. It is widely assumed carnosine has performance benefits due to its ability to resist pH changes in muscle. In one study, oral intake of β -alanine for 4 weeks was shown to increase carnosine levels.104 Another study showed sup- plementation with β -alanine for 10 weeks significantly elevated car- nosine levels at weeks 4 and 10.105 Subjects taking β -alanine have been shown to complete a greater number of repetitions during resistance exercise,81-82 resist fatigue,105–107 generate greater force with the legs,108 and even improve body composition.109 The intention and goals are to determine whether and how β -alanine use translates to actual benefits in athletes and their performance. The aforementioned improvements are assumed to convert into improved performance, which has been confirmed by several studies.110–112 In athletes, most benefits have been

## 1042SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

identified with improvements in intense, short-duration exercises of 0.5 to 10 minutes,112 such as sprinting and jumping ability.111 Although the benefits of β -alanine are much more pronounced in untrained athletes, benefits were still evident in trained athletes, which can be explained by improved exercise adaptation in highly trained athletes. However, the enhancements in trained athletes may be worthwhile if used in an applied setting, such as competition, where even a slight advantage may have profound results.112


Typical doses in studies range between 400 and 800 mg given multiple times throughout the day to achieve between 4 and 8 g. Doses above 800 mg at any given time may cause transient paresthesias. β -alanine appears to have a low toxic profile and is generally considered a safe nutraceutical.


β -alanine and sodium bicarbonate together, over β -alanine alone,113–115 have shown synergism in improving performance in highly trained athletes. Gains were most impressive after chronic use for 7 days, with the mechanism theorized to be due to the improved muscular alkalosis.116

## Beta-Hydroxy Beta-Methylbutyrate

Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is derived from the BCAA leucine, a known activator of mTORc1 (mechanistic target of rapa- mycin).117 HMB use at levels from 1 to 3 g per day while undergoing weight training may increase strength results and have positive effects on lean muscle gains.38,118,119 The largest and most beneficial responses come from studies on untrained athletes. Older individuals may also enjoy benefits from supplementation. Volkovich et al., in 2001, showed 3 g of HMB daily over 8 weeks given to elderly men and women led to significantly greater loss in fat in comparison with a placebo group.120 Muscle mass gains usually ranged from 1 to 2.2 lb over 3 to 6 weeks of training for those taking HMB versus placebo.27 Until recently, performance benefits in athletes or well-trained individuals were not as convincing as results in untrained subjects. However, the literature has shown significant benefits in young trained and untrained individuals. One quality study by Knitter et al., in 2000, showed HMB might protect against muscle damage from exercise.121 Well-trained runners were supplemented with 3 g per day over 6 weeks. In comparison with placebo, HMB-supplemented runners had lower markers of muscle damage evident by lower lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase. Additional studies in younger trained sub- jects, showed supplementation of 3 g of HMB improved peak power and 1 rep-max (1RM) leg press,122 along with increased strength in bench press, squat, and deadlift, vertical jump power, and improved lean body mass.123,124 Strikingly, HMB also shows promise as an ergogenic aid via its effect on the endocrine system. Studies in young, resistance-trained men taking HMG along with a resistance training protocol exhibited significant increases in growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth fac- tor 1 (IGF-1), and attenuation of elevated cortisol.123–125 The mechanism is not completely understood. However, it is suspected to induce mTORc1, inhibit the ubiquitin proteasome pathway thus reducing muscle degradation, stimulate mitochon- drial biogenesis,126 and induce synthesis of skeletal muscle satellite cells,117,127,128 with the result of increased muscle hypertrophy and muscle recovery.


The dose of HMB shown to be effective is 1 to 3 g per day.


HMB supplementation along with creatine may behave in a synergistic fashion.129 HMB is generally considered safe to use.

## Branched Chain Amino Acids

BCAAs are perhaps the most beneficial aspect of increased protein intake. They have been shown to increase protein synthesis, decrease protein breakdown, and speed recovery from exercise.130–132 Research suggests they may have some acute performance enhancement effects and play a key role in body composition.133–135 BCAAs include leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The body cannot synthesize these amino acids, making their dietary intake essential. BCAAs are necessary for production of other amino acids, most nota- bly alanine and glutamine, two of the most important amino acids used in gluconeogenesis. Low-calorie diets and stress can greatly increase the need of amino acid precursors for gluconeogenesis. Because BCAA are mainly metabolized by the muscle in comparison with other amino acids, which are metabolized by the liver,136 a large pool of BCAAs through dietary intake spares muscle protein breakdown and likely promotes muscle protein synthesis.137–139 BCAA supplementation has shown some effect on exercise per- formance, perceived exertion, and recovery. Matsumoto et al.135 had subjects drink either a BCAA beverage or a placebo 6 days before performing high-intensity cycling until exhaustion. The trial was a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study with a 1-week washout period between exercise sessions. BCAA increased plasma levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine during the exercise test. The contribution of fat burned during the exercise session was signifi- cantly greater for BCAA in comparison with placebo, as was the oxy- gen uptake and lactate thresholds at equivalent work levels. VO 2 max was also greater in the BCAA supplementation. Taken together, these results suggest BCAA supplementation may improve endurance exercise performance. Another study by Greer et al.132 looked at BCAA for endurance exercise improvement. This study did not show an acute performance advantage for BCAA during exercise but did show reduced damage. BCAA supplementation was significantly better than consumption of either a carbohydrate beverage or placebo at reducing markers of mus- cle damage. An earlier study by the same group showed comparable findings.134 One of the limiting factors for athletes is recovery. There are impressive findings on enhanced recovery from exercise using BCAA in response to high-intensity weight lifting and resistance training,131 with reductions in muscle damage evaluated via creatine kinase, lac- tate dehydrogenase, myoglobin, delayed-onset muscle soreness, and muscle function alteration.136 Preexercise supplementation of BCAAs in young trained athletes reduced exercise-induced muscle damage, attenuate the loss of strength and power after exercise,140 and reduce overall perception of muscle soreness.140,141 It is suspected that in addi- tion to being a fuel source for myocytes, BCAA may induce mitochon- drial biogenesis and scavenge ROS via upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ coactivator α .142 One of the more intriguing aspects of BCAA supplementation may be its role in optimizing body composition. Low-calorie diets and aerobic exercise are both known to reduce lean muscle tissue. BCAA supplementation attenuates this response and helps maintain muscle mass.133 In addition, BCAAs, specifically leucine, have unique actions as metabolic signaling molecules that may be able to increase energy expenditure,143 suppress appetite,144 and lower insulin.145 Although all these relatively new mechanisms have been shown only in mice, one small pilot human study including BCAA supplementation suggested that the same mechanisms may be at play in humans.146 Fifty-nine

healthy subjects participated in the study and were divided into a pla- cebo group (fiber) and then given either a high-concentration (12 g per day) or low-concentration (6 g per day) BCAA supplement. Subjects were supplemented for 14 days and were encouraged not to modify either eating behavior or exercise habits. Degree of weight loss was directly correlated with dose of BCAA given, with the largest weight loss being achieved in those who received the 12 g per day dose. Given the short time of the study, statistical significance was not achieved. The authors noted, “Design of this pilot study has more effects than can be analyzed satisfactorily with avail- able sample sizes. An analysis with “best possible” outcome did show that significance would have been possible with maximum weight loss difference from one group to another.” Based on this study, it is not yet possible to make a determination as to BCAA supplementation in weight loss. However, given the new understanding of BCAA signaling, the promising results in animals, and the interesting, although not sta- tistically significant, findings of this study, further evaluation certainly seems warranted.


Most research suggests a dose of between 6 and 12 g per day of BCAA.


Given that the dosages of BCAA are so high, it may be impractical to recommend this supplement in capsule form. BCAA powders are widely available and may provide convenience. Mixing BCAA powder in a small amount of high-glucose fruit juice, such as grape juice, may help increase compliance by masking the bitter taste and increasing absorption and utilization.

## Caffeine

Perhaps the most well-known performance-enhancing aid is caffeine. The consensus of studies shows caffeine has value in endurance exer- cise performance, anaerobic exercise outcomes, exercise recovery, and weight loss.147–149 In the body, caffeine absorption occurs rapidly and is then metabolized in the liver into theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine. Caffeine is lipid soluble, giving it quick access to the brain and other tissues. Caffeine is detectable in blood within 15 min- utes of intake, reaching peak levels at 1 hour. Caffeine is cleared from the system in 1 to 12 hours, depending on the individual’s activity of CYP1A2. Caffeine exerts strong influence on the nervous system, affecting both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, and several review studies suggest this is the most beneficial action of caf- feine related to performance enhancement.147–149 It acts to increase mental focus and fine motor skills. Beta-endorphin concentrations also rise with caffeine consumption, possibly resulting in decreased pain perception during intense activity.147 Also, the nervous system activation plays a strong role in sports, requiring bursts of speed and intensity. Caffeine spares muscle glycogen and shifts metabolism toward the increased use of fat from both subcutaneous and intramuscular compartments.149–151 Given that fat oxidation is a key component of endurance sports, caffeine can improve outcomes in long-distance events. It also has an interesting effect when dosed along with carbo- hydrate.152 A carbohydrate electrolyte beverage (6% glucose) spiked with caffeine (5 mg/kg of body weight) was able to bolster endurance performance by 9%.151 In high-intensity exercise, caffeine raises catecholamine produc- tion, increasing both lipolysis and glycogenolysis.147–149 This effect, along with increased activation of the central nervous system, may be the mechanism responsible for better performance in high-intensity endeavors. In 2006 Schneiker et al.153 compared 6 mg/kg of body weight caffeine ingestion with placebo in amateur male athletes. In this study, either caffeine or placebo was taken 60 minutes before two 36-minute exercise sessions consisting of multiple short sprints sepa- rated by 2 minutes of recovery. Caffeine intake increased sprint per- formance 8.5% and 7.6% over placebo in the first and second bouts, respectively. Caffeine also increased power output in comparison with placebo. Additional studies confirm these ergogenic effects of caffeine in high-intensity and resistance training activities. When comparing caffeine intake and placebo, caffeine showed significant improvements in total weight lifted in comparison with placebo. Interestingly, the same study compared coffee with decaffeinated coffee with added caffeine and found both the coffee and decaffeinated plus caffeine improved power output, thus suggesting the benefits of coffee may be due to the caffeine content.154 Two well-designed meta-analyses both concluded caffeine to be a beneficial ergogenic aid in improving anaer- obic performance, peak power output, and total power output.155,156 Furthermore, it appears to be most effective in exercises lasting 45 sec- onds to 8 minutes.143 This same combination, carbohydrate and caffeine, may also play a role in recovery from activity. In a study comparing a carbohydrate recovery beverage alone with one spiked with caffeine, glycogen synthesis was increased by 66% in the carbohydrate-plus-caffeine group.157 This may be mostly due to caffeine’s ability to increase the absorption of glucose from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Caffeine’s activity as a fat-loss aid comes from its epinephrine-in- ducing effects. Studies as far back as 1990 showed as little as 100 mg of caffeine, the equivalent of a cup of coffee, could increase thermo- genesis even in habitual coffee drinkers.158 Other studies on caffeine showed increased fat oxidation, with one older study showing a 30% greater blood free fatty acid level 2 hours after workout in comparison with placebo.147–150 Although the mechanism by which caffeine exerts its benefits is unclear, it is suspected to be due to several factors, including improved catecholamine response to the stress of exercise, improved contractil- ity by reduced intramuscular potassium accumulation,159 a decreased perception of pain, and increased alertness and arousal.147


Caffeine intake appears to be physiologically somewhat different from coffee intake. Although the research on pure supplemental caffeine consumption is fairly clear on performance benefits, effects of coffee consumption are less clear. Caffeine consumption shows effects when taken from 15 to 60 minutes before exercise at a dose of 6 mg/kg of body weight. For a 160-lb individual, this amount is the equivalent of about 430 mg of caffeine. An 8-oz cup of coffee has about 150 mg of caffeine on the high end. This amounts to close to 3 cups of drip coffee as the dose for a 160-lb individual.147–149


Concerns about coffee intake and risk of dehydration are unfounded. No good evidence suggests caffeine intake leads to an increased risk of dehydration. Users of caffeine will develop some tolerance. Nonhabitual users experience slightly better benefits from coffee intake in comparison with regular users. Coffee intake can also have a nega- tive effect on digestive function.147–149 High amounts of caffeine intake can cause negative symptoms, including heart palpitations, insomnia, anxiety, and tachycardia. Coffee intake and caffeine intake can be espe- cially problematic for individuals who are genetically known as “slow metabolizers” of caffeine (CYP1A2*1C). As such, the therapeutic win- dow for enhancing athletic performance may be enhanced in compar- ison with a “fast metabolizer” of caffeine.

## Creatine Monohydrate

The International Society of Sports Nutrition has called creatine “the most effective nutritional supplement available to athletes to increase high-intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.”27 All the performance-enhancing benefits are hypothesized to come down to two factors: increasing the amount of energy available to mitochondria in the form of adenosine triphosphate and increasing cellular hydration. Creatine has been under investigation for more than 60 years. It is highly concentrated in muscle tissue, with all but 4% to 5% of body creatine residing in the muscle. Most of the creatine in the body is in a phosphorylated form called phosphocreatine. The major function of this supplement is to provide a rapid source of energy by maintaining adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability. Although creatine can be made in the body, it requires significant resources, including the amino acids arginine and glycine, magne- sium, S-adenosylmethionine, vitamin B 12 , and folate, among others. Creatine is also present in the food supply and is especially rich in ani- mal protein. The highest concentrations are found in lean cuts of red meat, game meat, and fish, including salmon and tuna. Two pounds of lean red meat contains close to 5 g of creatine. Cooking food may have a negative effect on the availability of creatine. Phosphocreatine can supply ATP for the energy required for quick bursts of activity lasting around 10 seconds. Once these high-energy phosphates are depleted, the body relies more heavily on anaerobic metabolism. Supplementation of creatine is thought to “supersaturate muscle” and allow for greater performance of short, explosive exercise. Another benefit of creatine that may be key is cellular hydration. Creatine storage in the muscle is thought to set up a hyperhydration muscle cellular environment, which then improves the thermoregula- tory response of the cell, allowing for improved adaptation to heat stress, thus better helping the cell respond to the stressors of exercise.148,160,161 Research has shown hydrated muscle tissue may be better able to both synthesize new muscle tissue and resist protein breakdown.26–28,162 Studies on weight training and high-intensity interval exercise showed creatine as a reliable and beneficial training aid. Rawson et al.163 in an April 2011 study showed that, in comparison with placebo, a low-dose creatine supplement (approximately 2 g daily) taken for 6 weeks signifi- cantly enhances the ability of muscle to resist fatigue.117 Kerksick et al.164 showed 4 weeks of creatine supplementation significantly improved both strength and lean body mass when loaded at 20 g per day for 5 days fol- lowed by 5 g per day. In another study on creatine, 23 young males were divided into a creatine group and a placebo group.165 The creatine dose was given 5 g four times daily for 6 days. Both before and 7 days after supplementation, participants did 30 seconds of maximal sprinting on a bicycle ergometer. This regimen was repeated five times with 2 minutes rest in between. The creatine group enjoyed greater power output and less fatigue in comparison with the placebo group. Researchers found 7.6% increased power in the creatine group from the first to the second test, whereas the placebo group saw no improvement. Compounded lower body movements are key exercises in athletic training and performance. Creatine supplementation was shown to significantly improve maximal weight lifted in squats and leg presses by 8% and 3%, respectively.166 The ergogenic benefits of creatine are very impressive, with several large meta-analyses suggesting creatine as a significant athletic perfor- mance aid, especially in exercises requiring athletes to perform more series of sets or sprints. By increasing gains in athletic training such as increased strength, muscle mass, and endurance, supplementation with creatine allows athletes to achieve the most benefit out of their training, thus resulting in improved real-life athletic performance.167 In addition to improving performance, creatine may also increase recovery from intense exercise and increase lean body mass.144–146,168 Lean body mass gains can be significantly greater with creatine than with controls while weight training. A review by Krieder et al.168,169 determined creatine supplementation could generate a 2- to 5-lb greater muscle gain over 4 to 12 weeks of training in comparison with nonsupplementation. Recovery is often overlooked in athletes, with the mentality that more is better; however, overtraining is very common and certainly is a detri- ment to overall performance. The muscle-sparing and enhanced-recovery effects of creatine are evident in several studies that found anti-inflamma- tory effects of creatine supplementation, with reductions in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), lactate dehydroge- nase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and C-reactive protein (CRP),170,171 and additionally with sparing muscle glycogen.172 Those studies strongly suggest that creatine establishes a biochemical environment allowing ath- letes to tolerated increased exercise volume and intensity.


Creatine monohydrate is the most-studied form of creatine. Dosage of creatine is usually prescribed in two ways: a loading dose “fast dose” or a maintenance dose “slow dose.” Creatine loading, or “fast dosing,” is the most-studied protocol and reliably saturates muscle creatine stores. This dose entails 0.3 mg/kg of body weight daily taken in divided doses every 2 to 4 hours over 3 to 5 days. This dose essentially amounts typ- ically to 20 to 30 g of creatine monohydrate daily for a 160- and 220- lb individual, respectively. Thereafter, the maintenance dose is used and consists of 3 to 5 g of creatine daily. Dosing the maintenance dose from the beginning, or “slow dosing,” involves consuming 2 to 5 g per day over 3 to 4 weeks. Consuming creatine with a small amount of (From Kerksick CM, Arent S, Schoenfeld BJ, et al. International society of sports nutrition position stand: nutrient timing.

glucose-rich juice, such as grape juice, can improve muscle saturation but has not been shown to increase performance benefits.27,162


Creatine has now been studied extensively in several reviews, and long- term studies on safety have shown it to be safe in adults and adoles- cents. The only potential drawback to creatine use may be in those predisposed to fat gain.162,173–175 There also may be implications for testosterone metabolism with creatine, because one study showed increased testosterone-to-dihydrotestosterone conversion with cre- atine intake.176

## Green Tea Extract

Tea catechins from green tea have been consumed in Asian countries for centuries. Habitual green tea consumption has been shown to be correlated with lower body weights and less body fat.177 Studies have shown extracts of catechins from green tea can increase oxidation of fat both at rest126 and while exercising.178 Dulloo et al.179 showed green tea intake elevated 24-hour resting energy expenditure with increased fatty acid oxidation in comparison with an equal amount of caffeine taken alone. A 90-day clinical trial combining green tea extract (GTE) with a low-calorie diet resulted in significantly greater weight loss in comparison with weight loss in a nontreatment group (30 vs. 11 lbs).177 Interestingly, the activity of GTE may have particular use against abdominal fat.180 Ichnose et al.181 conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of GTE intake over a 10-week period. Exercise testing was done before and after the 10-week supplementation. Subjects received either a pla- cebo or GTE (573 mg total of green tea catechins). Both the placebo and GTE contained equal caffeine content. In addition to the supplement, both groups exercised by cycling at 60% VO 2 max 60 min/day, 3 days/ week. At the conclusion of 10 weeks, no changes in performance param- eters were noted between groups. However, there was a statistically sig- nificant increase in fat utilization for the GTE group but no such change in the placebo group. The pre-exercise use of GTE was tested in a small human trial and showed induction of GLUT-4 receptors and improved fat oxidation. This finding further supports the use of GTE in improv- ing body composition.182 Animal studies have shown GTE to improve endurance and reduce fatigue,183,184 and one human trial showed sig- nificant improvement in power and endurance in nontrained healthy males.185


GTE dosage is usually 300 to 500 mg of a standardized extract daily.


GTE can cause nausea in susceptible populations. It is also frequently combined with caffeine.

## Quercetin

Quercetin is a bioflavonoid present in a variety of foods, including black and green tea, capers, apples, onions (giving them their yellow color), grapes, citrus fruit, tomato, broccoli, leafy green vegetables, and a number of berries. Davis et al.186 conducted a small double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial on quercetin’s effect on endurance capacity. Baseline VO 2 max and time to exhaustion were determined for 12 participants before 7 days of supplementation with either quer- cetin (500 mg twice daily) or placebo. On follow-up testing, the quer- cetin group saw statistically significant increases in time to fatigue (13.2%) and VO 2 max (3.9%) in comparison with placebo. Similar but more modest results were seen by Nieman et al.187 in untrained sub- jects. Dumke et al.188 showed no effect of quercetin on trained subjects. Quercetin’s performance-enhancing effects are often attributed to its being a polyphenol and a potent antioxidant. Given that in nature quer- cetin is present among other polyphenols, the benefits of polyphenols on exercise performance cannot be ignored. Although quercetin, among the many polyphenols, appears to be the most predominant ergogenic poly- phenol, polyphenols as a whole appear to moderately improve athletic performance.189 Although the goal is to be as precise as possible in deci- phering which polyphenol and which dose produces beneficial outcomes, there is something to say about the synergism of multiple polyphenols that mimics their occurrence in nature. The synergism of multiple polyphenols is evident in the research showing benefit overall from polyphenol intake up to 688 mg daily, which is certainly feasible through diet.189


The dosage of quercetin based on the previously mentioned studies is 1000 mg per day in divided doses.

## Rhodiola

Rhodiola rosea is widely regarded as an “adaptogen.” Adaptogens are defined as substances that aid the physiology in adaptation to stress, increasing function when it may be low and lowering it when it may be high. Anecdotal, animal, and some human research has hinted that Rhodiola may have ergogenic properties.190–193 Several studies on Rhodiola suggest it may have benefit for performance, but the consen- sus leans more toward increased ability to adapt and recover.191–193 A well-designed study on Rhodiola was completed by Parisi et al.,194 in which 14 competitively active males between the ages of 20 and were given supplements of 170 mg of Rhodiola rosea extract daily for weeks. All subjects completed VO 2 max testing before supplementation. At the conclusion of 4 weeks, 30 minutes of cycling at 75% of VO 2 max was completed. The subjects then had a 2-week washout period when no supplementation was taken. This process was followed by 4 more weeks of supplementation of placebo. At that point, the testing was repeated. In this study on Rhodiola and placebo supplementation, participants’ blood was drawn before testing, during supplementation, and after test- ing. Their rating of exertion was also monitored via the Borg exertion scale. There were no differences in any performance parameters, including perceived exertion. Both lactate and creatine kinase levels were reduced postexercise in the Rhodiola group. The Rhodiola group also showed increased levels of total antioxidants in comparison with placebo.


Typical dose ranges are between 100 and 600 mg per day of R. rosea extract standardized to 3% rosavin + 1% salidroside. Rhodiola appears to have very low occurrences of side effects, and clinical evidence sug- gests it has a low toxicity.

## Sodium Bicarbonate

Due to the fast accumulation of protons (hydrogen [H+]) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) during high-intensity anaerobic activity, buffering capac- ity in muscle and blood is essential. The chief buffering compound is the bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 −). HCO 3 − buffers by the following reaction: H+ + HCO 3 − ←→ H 2 CO 3 ←→ H 2 O + CO 2 . The CO 2 can then be off- loaded in the lungs. Sodium bicarbonate provides a reservoir of HCO 3 −, theoretically giving greater capacity to resist fatigue-induced pH changes at the muscle cell. Several studies have shown supplemental sodium bicar- bonate can stabilize pH changes for exercise lasting from 60 seconds to several minutes and improve performance.195–198 This finding explains the significant benefits seen with the use of sodium bicarbonate in high-intensity short duration exercises such as sprinting.199 An addi- tional study assessed the benefits of sodium bicarbonate on a basketball

simulation protocol, resulting in significant improvements in sprint time and muscle fatigue attenuation.200 Benefits in endurance racing were also seen in athletes, with improvements in maximum running speed, muscle fatigue, and increased time to exhaustion.201,202


Sodium bicarbonate can be taken in a performance dose before exer- cise or a loading dose several days before an event. The pre-exercise dose is 0.3 g/kg body weight of sodium bicarbonate taken in water between 60 and 90 minutes before an exercise bout. The loading dose of bicarbonate is taken over a 5-day period and consists of 5 g taken twice a day for 5 days.


No safety issues appear to arise with sodium bicarbonate intake aside from digestive upset at higher doses. However, because the average per- son consumes excessive amounts of sodium, this intervention should be accompanied by recommendations to decrease other sources. The primarily source is salt, but because sodium is the cation for several chemical food additives, all prepared foods must be considered.

## Spirulina

The consumption of the well-known algae Spirulina has been a prac- tice among athletes from diverse cultures such as India, China, and Cuba.203 Spirulina is considered a member of the “blue-green algae family” along with another popular algae, Chlorella. Spirulina differs from Chlorella because it does not have a cell wall, rendering it more digestible. Little research has been reported on this compound except the anecdotal reports of use and benefit from athletes in the countries mentioned and some positive outcomes in mice.204 Although there is very little supportive evidence for its use, we include it here in this chapter as a novel compound that shows some promise. A 2006 study by Lu et al.203 followed up on anecdotal reports from athletes and positive outcomes in animals that Spirulina may aid in decreasing oxidative stress from exercise. Sixteen student volunteers were divided into two groups. One group added approximately 7 g Spirulina to their regular diet, whereas the control group was given the same amount of soy protein. The supplementation lasted for 3 weeks. Blood was collected before and after supplementation in both groups. Both groups also participated in a treadmill run to exhaustion the day before and day after supplementation. After 3 weeks, the Spirulina group saw positive changes in blood chemistry, such as reductions in malondialdehyde, and increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lactate, as well as significant improvement in treadmill running time to exhaustion (713 vs. 765 seconds).203 No significant change was seen in the soy group. These findings suggest that Spirulina can reduce oxi- dative damage induced by exercise while still improving performance. A 2010 study by Kalafati et al.205 looked at Spirulina supplementa- tion in a small double-blind, placebo-controlled and counterbalanced trial. Each subject received 6 g Spirulina or placebo for 4 weeks and then underwent exercise testing. The exercise challenge involved a moderate-intensity run at 70% to 75% of VO 2 max for 120 minutes followed by a 95% of VO 2 max run until exhaustion. Spirulina supple- mentation decreased carbohydrate oxidation by 10.3% while improv- ing fat burning by 10.9% during the 2-hour run. Time to fatigue was also significantly improved in the Spirulina group. Similar to the find- ings by Lu et al. and others,206 these performance enhancements were also complemented by multiple positive changes in exercise antioxi- dant status, such as increased glutathione and reduced lipid peroxida- tion, even up to 24 hours after exercise. Although exercise is a physical activity, a mental endurance and focus is essential in athletic performance. Spirulina may affect the physical and mental aspect of training; one study showed 3 g daily of Spirulina signifi- cantly improved mathematical-based mental fatigue acutely and after weeks, and improved short-term endurance exercise.207


Spirulina dose, based on these limited studies, appears to be 6 to 7 g per day.


Quality of algae in products is a concern, because these compounds can easily accumulate heavy metals present in the environment. Clean sources of Spirulina should be sought.

## Whey Protein

Whey protein is one of the most popular meal replacements and pro- tein sources for athletes. The protein present in whey mimics many of the proteins present in human breast milk. Whey is very rich in essential amino acids and has an exceptionally high biological value of 104. It is a rich source of sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine), is high in glutamine, and contains large amounts of the BCAAs leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The large amount of BCAA present in whey protein may be one of its key benefits (see section on “Branched Chain Amino Acids”).208 Mitochondrial biogenesis Cell Metab. 2010 Oct 6;12(4):362-72.

## 1047CHAPTER 139 Sports Nutrition

Whey moves through the stomach rapidly and is absorbed quickly. For this reason, it has been designated as a “fast protein.” Casein, on the other hand, transits the stomach slowly and is referred to as a “slow protein.”209 The different speed of absorption between whey and casein protein fractions can be harnessed when used in muscle-build- ing protocols as described in the “Protein” section. No studies exist comparing the effects of different protein sources on nitrogen balance, body composition, or performance in trained ath- letes. However, whey has been shown to promote growth and enhance nitrogen balance in experimental animals and burn victims.210,211 Whey protein has one of the highest concentrations of cysteine, the rate-limiting molecule in the de novo synthesis of glutathione.212 Any supplement that can aid the body’s endogenous production of key antioxidants like glutathione may play a role in lessening damage and speeding recovery from exercise. Although free-radical generation during exercise has been shown to be a normal consequence,213 and training, in and of itself, increases antioxidant systems in the body, supplementation can further aid endogenous antioxidant systems. Although this supplement may help with recovery,214,215 it has not been shown to directly enhance performance.216 Glutathione levels are reduced during exercise.217,218 Ultrae ndurance events, such as marathons and triathlons, can increase oxidized gluta- thione levels by 189%.219 Because whey protein provides factors that increase glutathione production, a higher intake could play a role in protecting against damage during exercise and recovery after exercise.220 Another benefit of whey protein may be its ability to bolster the content of other important amino acids. Whey enhances body levels of cysteine, taurine, glutamine, and BCAAs, among others.159 This enhancement could have consequences in several areas, including immune function.221,222 Nothing interrupts training more than illness. Whey protein also has merit as a fat loss and muscle-building aid. Twenty grams of whey protein taken 20 minutes before exercise increased the number of calories burned after exercise by 100 com- pared with no supplementation.223 This increase may make it a useful preworkout meal compared with carbohydrate, which may slow fat loss.1 More recent studies suggest that the benefit of whey protein in inducing muscle protein synthesis may relate more to the dose rather than the timing.224 Young resistance-trained males were given 20 g and 40 g of whey protein after training, when the latter group have greater muscle protein synthesis. The exercise stimulus cannot be ignored because these participants trained 3 days a week with total-body exer- cises, which may increase the demand of amino acids given more muscle groups are exercised. This finding then suggests that perhaps more strenuous and complete total-body exercises may require more protein.224 With improvements in muscle mass, subsequent increases in basal metabolic rate and improved body composition are expected and confirmed in both male and female athlete and nonathletes.225–228 Whey protein also shows a powerful ability to regulate hunger and binge eating for weight control. Pal et al.229 carried out a randomized crossover study on 22 males given equivalent gram doses of four liquid protein meals. The four protein meals were whey, tuna, turkey, and egg albumin. Four hours after the liquid protein meals, participants were given access to an all-you-can-eat buffet-style meal. The whey protein group had much greater satiety response and consumed significantly less food than any other group reported, showing whey protein as having a potential role in appetite regulation. A similar study by Akhavan et al.230 showed whey protein taken before an all-you-can-eat pizza meal significantly lowered food intake, postmeal glucose, and insulin levels in response to the meal.


As discussed in this section as well as in the sections on protein and meal timing, whey protein can provide benefit when timed appropriately with exercise. Consuming whey protein postworkout may be one of the most beneficial things an athlete can do to maximize lean body mass. Whey protein is low glycemic but insulinogenic at the same time.222,229 Immediately after a workout until about 2 hours after the workout, the body is uniquely sensitized to insulin. This sensitization may create a unique opportunity for muscle growth without fat gain, especially in a postworkout setting.222 The addition of a small amount of carbohydrate may be more beneficial in terms of muscle gain. In studies analyzing postwork- out intake of protein alone, carbohydrate alone, or a combination of both, protein and carbohydrate together generated the greatest insu- lin response.178,180,181,231 This combination enhances muscle glycogen synthesis and storage and has benefit for athletes in terms of recov- ery.178,180 Adding fat to the mix is not beneficial and may blunt this response.232,233 Combining whey protein with creatine may have synergistic benefit as well. Men supplementing their diets with a combination of whey protein and creatine together (1.2 g/kg per day of whey with 0.1 g/kg per day creatine) enjoyed greater improvements in strength and mus- cle mass in comparison with placebo.234


Although many individuals are dairy intolerant, whey protein seems to be handled well by most people, probably because pure whey pro- tein has low levels of lactose and is easily digested. However, people with known dairy sensitivities or allergies should be cautious with their intake of whey. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein in whey has been suggested as a potential cause or possible contributing factor to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.235,236Anti-BSA antibodies have been found in people with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Proteins on the β -cells of the pancreas may “mimic” the BSA proteins in whey, causing immune reac- tivity against both the whey protein and the β -cells.235 Theoretically, this is “protein mimicry” at work and an ongoing debate that has not yet been resolved. Although the research is inconclusive,237 it should not be completely ruled out as a possible environmental etiology.


From the basic understanding of biochemistry and physiology, the role of magnesium in nerve conduction, skeletal muscle contraction, and cardiovascular physiology is often overlooked as involving an essential mineral. In fact, most Americans are deficient in magnesium; approxi- mately 60% receive less than the recommended 330 to 350 mg per day for men and 255 to 265 mg per day for women. Although we may not see an epidemic of magnesium deficiency, we are seeing a significant increase in chronic inflammatory diseases, which has been connected with subclinical magnesium deficiency.238–240 Increased levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-1, fibrinogen, and VCAM-1 are correlated with magnesium deficiency,238 raise concerns that perhaps magnesium-deficient athletes, given the metabolic stress brought on by rigorous training, may further be affected by inflammation poten- tially impairing performance and recovery. Studies assessing magnesium intake in athletes confirms that ath- letes are not unique, and they too are deficient due to inadequate consumption of dietary magnesium similar to that of the general popu- lation,241–243 with some studies showing consumption as low as 75% of the RDA.244 Athletes cannot be assumed to be immune to the adverse effects of magnesium deficiency. Athletes with adequate magnesium intake were associated with improved endogenous antioxidants, such as catalase and glutathione.245 This finding would lead to the assumption that magnesium is an ergogenic aid. Many of the studies done on athletes assessed

magnesium status via a dietary intake, whereas others showed dif- ferences in magnesium status via erythrocyte or plasma magnesium concentrations. Surprisingly, several studies did not show improved performance from magnesium supplementation. However, one study assessing male volleyball athletes did show a small but significant improvement in plyometric countermovement exercise.246 An addi- tional study in elderly women suggests magnesium supplementation may improve age-related decline in physical performance as evident in functional movements, such as chair-stand time and walking speed.247 Taking a holistic, functional approach and given the common defi- ciency of magnesium among various populations, it would be prudent for athletes to consume at minimum the 400 to 500 mg of magnesium daily, preferably in more bioavailable forms such as citrate and glyci- nate. Although the literature does not strongly correlate magnesium with athletic performance, supplementation would provide optimal neurological, muscular, and cardiovascular function.


Based on the RDA, a minimum of 400 to 500 mg of magnesium sup- plementation daily would at minimum provide the necessary require- ments for muscle function. Loose stools may occur in bolus doses, which may require slow titration up to 500 mg or bowel tolerance.

## Cold Water Immersion

Much anecdotal evidence exists asserting cold water immersion (CWI), a form of hydrotherapy or cryotherapy, as helping with recovery. Athletes from high school to the professional level have been using it for years to help with delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and fatigue. If recov- ery time can be shortened, then athletic performance can at least be maintained or improved, allowing athletes improved competitive per- formance and more time to train. This practice can allow for enhanced training loads, resulting in improved muscle function. Currently, the research tends to suggest there may be some benefit248–250 to using CWI, with improvements in jump performance250 and improved abil- ity to complete more work subsequent to training sessions.249 However, blood biochemistries showed no significant variations after cold water immersions.250 A meta-analysis published in The Journal of Strength and Conditional Research by Higgins et al. in general showed benefits from CWI in terms of neuromuscular recovery and the perception of fatigue but not necessarily perception of muscle soreness.251 The most benefit from CWI in reducing muscle soreness was noticed at durations of 11 to 15 minutes at º C to º C.252 Interestingly, this time and temperature range resulted in reduced muscle soreness up to 24 hours postexercise and in some after 24 hours. Some of the acute benefit may be attributed to the analgesic effect of cold on the pain-spasm cycle,253 but the prolonged benefit may be attributed to the reduction and slowing of the inflammatory response.254 However, more study is needed in this area to flesh out the details of the mechan- ics behind CWI. Considering that CWI tends to be a safe and cost-efficient way of possibly improving performance, an athlete, trainer, or coach looking for a competitive edge may benefit from putting it to use. Caution must be taken with longer emersions and lower temperatures, when CWI may excessively depress sensory and motor neurons, possibly leading to temporary nerve damage.255 CWI should not be used before exercise or activity, because it reduces nerve conduction velocity, thus affecting the neuromuscular response.255


Optimal cold immersion appears to be 11 to 15 minutes at º C to 15 º C.

## Ribose

The amount of ATP stored in the muscle available for immediate use is limited, and once used, must be resynthesized in the muscle. Ribose, a naturally occurring pentose sugar, is attached to the adenine that is necessary to produce adenosine. Some studies show benefit of ribose supporting and replenishing ATP levels,256 and although this makes sense biochemically, realistically it has not translated into improved athletic performance. Studies assessing the by-product of adenine nucleotide after ribose ingestion showed no significant changes.257 There is no convincing evidence suggesting ribose is a limiting factor in muscle ATP synthesis, nor does it improve athletic performance.257–260 The literature suggests ribose supplementation may be most ben- eficial for the elderly population, in comparison with younger indi- viduals. Ribose has a rejuvenating effect on the heart, as it improves well-being and quality of life. As part of the aging process, the ability of mitochondria to synthesize ATP may become less efficient, thus affect- ing skeletal and cardiac muscle function. Therefore ribose supplemen- tation in older athletes may provide an ergogenic effect in terms of workout recovery and endurance.261–263 Although the safety profile of ribose is excellent, it needs much more study before classifying it as an ergogenic aid.

insights into the role of stress in disease. According to Selye, stress in itself should not be viewed in a negative context. It is not the stressor that determines the response; instead, it is the individual’s internal reaction that triggers the response. This internal reaction is highly indi- vidualized. What one person may experience as stress, the next person may view entirely differently. Selye perhaps summarized his view best in the following passage from his book The Stress of Life2: No one can live without experiencing some degree of stress all the time. You may think that only serious disease or intensive physi- cal or mental injury can cause stress. This is false. Crossing a busy intersection, exposure to a draft, or even sheer joy is enough to acti- vate the body’s stress mechanisms to some extent. Stress is not even necessarily bad for you; it is also the spice of life, for any emotion, any activity causes stress. But, of course, your system must be pre- pared to take it. The same stress which makes one person sick can be an invigorating experience for another. The key statement Selye made may be “your system must be pre- pared to take it.” A significant body of knowledge has been accumu- lated delineating methodologies for helping patients develop healthful, rather than disease-facilitating, responses to both short- and long-term stress.


Evaluating the effect of stress on a patient’s health status requires a complete clinical assessment (e.g., review of systems, medical his- tory, physical examination, sleep history, etc.). Many people who are “stressed out” may not be able to identify exactly what is causing them to feel stressed. Typical presenting symptoms are insomnia, depres- sion, fatigue, headache, upset stomach, digestive disturbances, and irritability. One useful tool to assess the role that stress may play is the Social Readjustment Rating Scale developed by Holmes and Rahe3 (Table 140.1). The scale was originally designed to predict the risk of a serious disease due to stress. Various life-changing events are numerically rated according to their potential to cause disease. Notice that even events commonly viewed as positive, such as an outstanding personal achievement, carry stress. If a person is under a great deal of immediate stress or has endured a fair amount of stress for a few months or longer, it is appropriate to assess adrenal dysfunction more accurately with laboratory methods. The standard interpretation of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale is that a total of 200 or more units in 1 year is considered to Data from Benson H. The relaxation response. New York: William Morrow, 1975.

be predictive of a high likelihood of experiencing a serious disease. However, rather than using the scale solely to predict the likelihood of serious disease, the clinician can use the scale to evaluate a patient’s level of stressor exposure because everyone reacts differently to stress- ful events. Laboratory assessment generally involves evaluating aspects of the HPA axis. The gold standard for diagnosing dysfunction of the HPA axis is the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone test. This test is often used in research studies to monitor the clinical course of depression. More popular in the clinical setting are assessment tools based on salivary cortisol levels.4,5 Salivary hor- mone levels are reproducible, comparable to plasma levels, and easy to assess. One straightforward test that is a reasonably good predictor of HPA dysregulation is the cortisol-awakening response. Salivary levels generally show a sharp rise upon awakening and during the first hour after waking. Generally, an initially hyperactive HPA response results in elevated cortisol levels, whereas more chronic stress, insomnia, or depression may blunt this effect.6,7 Another popular test is measuring salivary cortisol levels at awakening and in the evening, usually along with dehydroepi- androsterone (DHEA). The classic pattern associated with chronic stress is elevated cortisol combined with reduced DHEA, indicat- ing a shift toward glucocorticoid production and away from sex hormone steroid production. This pattern is often associated with anxiety and depression. Adrenal exhaustion is characterized by low cortisol and low DHEA. Adrenal exhaustion is a common side effect of continual high stress as well as steroid drugs, such as predni- sone, which are used in the treatment of allergic or inflammatory diseases.


Whether currently aware of it or not, the patient has developed a pat- tern for coping with stress. Unfortunately, most people have found patterns and methods that ultimately do not support good health. Negative coping patterns must be identified and replaced with positive ways of coping. The clinician should try to identify any negative or destructive coping patterns, listed in Box 140.2, that the patient may have developed and try to replace those patterns with more positive measures for dealing with stress. Stress management can be substantially improved by assisting the patient in the following six equally important areas: • Techniques to calm the mind, promote parasympathetic tone, and promote a positive mental attitude • Lifestyle factors • Exercise • A healthful diet designed to nourish the body and support physio- logical processes • Dietary and botanical supplements designed to support the body as a whole, but especially the adrenal glands • Supervised stress management program

## Calming the Mind and Body

Learning to calm the mind and body is extremely important in reliev- ing stress. Among the easiest methods for the patient to learn are relaxation exercises. The goal of relaxation techniques is to produce a physiological response known as a relaxation response—a response that is exactly opposite to the stress response that reflects activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. Although an individual may relax by simply sleeping, watching television, or reading a book, relaxation techniques are designed specifically to produce the relaxation response. The term relaxation response was coined by Harvard professor and cardiologist Herbert Benson in the early 1970s to describe a physio- logical response that is just the opposite of the stress response.1 With the stress response (Box 140.3), the sympathetic nervous system dominates. With the relaxation response (Box 140.4), the parasym- pathetic nervous system dominates. The parasympathetic nervous sys- tem controls bodily functions such as digestion, breathing, and heart rate during periods of rest, relaxation, visualization, meditation, and sleep. Although the sympathetic nervous system is designed to protect against immediate danger, the parasympathetic system is designed for repair, maintenance, and restoration of the body. The relaxation response can be achieved through a variety of tech- niques. The methodology should be determined by patient interest because all techniques have the same physiological effect—a state of deep relaxation. The most popular techniques are meditation, prayer, progressive relaxation, self-hypnosis, and biofeedback. To produce the desired long-term health benefits, the patient should use the relaxation technique for at least 5 to 10 minutes each day.

## Breathing

Producing deep relaxation with any technique requires learning how to breathe. One of the most powerful methods of producing less stress and more energy in the body is by breathing with the diaphragm.

## 1052SECTION 5 Syndromes and Special Topics

Diaphragm breathing activates the relaxation centers in the brain and the parasympathetic nervous system. Box 140.5 lists a 10-step tech- nique for teaching diaphragmatic breathing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Progressive Relaxation

One of the most popular techniques for producing the relaxation response is progressive relaxation. The technique is based on a very simple procedure of comparing tension with relaxation. Many people are not aware of the sensation of relaxation. In progressive relaxation, an individual is taught what it feels like to relax by comparing relax- ation with muscle tension. The basic technique is to have the patient contract a muscle force- fully for a period of 1 to 2 seconds and then give way to a feeling of relaxation in that muscle. The procedure systematically goes through all the muscles of the body, progressively producing a deep state of relaxation. The procedure begins with contracting the muscles of the face and neck, then the upper arms and chest, followed by the lower arms and hands. The process is repeated progressively down the body, from the abdomen through the buttocks, the thighs, and calves to the feet. This whole process is repeated two or three times. This technique is often used in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. Progressive relaxation, deep-breathing exercises, or some other stress reduction technique is an important component of a compre- hensive stress management program.

## Lifestyle Factors

A patient’s lifestyle is a major determinant of his or her stress levels. The two primary areas of concern (other than addressing negative cop- ing patterns) are time management and relationship issues. One of the biggest stressors for most people is time. They simply do not feel they have enough of it. Box 140.6 provides tips on time management for patients. Another major cause of stress for many people is interpersonal rela- tionships. Interpersonal relationships can be divided into three major categories: marital, family, and job related. The quality of any rela- tionship ultimately comes down to the quality of the communication. Learning to communicate effectively goes a very long way in reduc- ing the stress and occasional (or frequent) conflicts of interpersonal relationships. Box 140.7 lists seven tips for effective communication, regardless of the type of interpersonal relationship.

## 1053CHAPTER 140 Stress Management


The immediate effect of exercise is stress on the body. However, with a regular exercise program, the body adapts, and exercise becomes an effective stress reduction technique. With regular exercise, the body becomes stronger, functions more efficiently, and has greater endur- ance. Exercise is a vital component of a comprehensive stress manage- ment program and overall good health. People who exercise regularly are much less likely to experience fatigue and depression. Tension, depression, feelings of inadequacy, and worries diminish greatly with regular exercise. Exercise alone has been demonstrated to have a tremendous effect in terms of improving mood and the ability to handle stressful life situations in both adults of all ages and adolescents as well. Exercise positively affects mood and reduces stress through physiological and biochemical mechanisms, including endorphins, mitochondria, mammalian target of rapamycin, neurotransmitters and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and even the microbiome.8,9

## Dietary Guidelines

An individual with stress or anxiety must support the biochemistry of the body by following some important dietary guidelines. Specifically, the patient must do the following: • Eliminate or restrict the intake of caffeine. • Eliminate or restrict the intake of alcohol. • Eliminate refined carbohydrates from the diet. • Eat a diverse range of whole foods. • Increase the potassium-to-sodium (K/Na) ratio. • Eat regular planned meals in a relaxed environment. • Control food allergies. According to Selye,2 whether or not stress is harmful is based on the strength of the system. From a purely physiological perspective, it can be strongly argued that the delivery of high-quality nutrition to the cells of the body is the critical factor in determining the strength of the system. When the eating habits of Americans are examined as a whole, it is little wonder that so many people have stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Most Americans are not providing their bodies with the high-quality nutrition they need. Instead of eating foods rich in vital nutrients, most Americans focus on refined foods high in calories, sugar, fat, and cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

## Caffeine

The average American consumes 150 to 225 mg of caffeine daily, or roughly the amount of caffeine in two cups of coffee. Although most people can handle this amount, some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than other people, owing to decreased activity of Phase I detoxification enzymes. Even small amounts of caffeine can affect sen- sitive people, whereas those with normal sensitivity respond to large amounts. Excessive caffeine consumption can produce “caffeinism characterized by symptoms of depression, nervousness, irritability, recurrent headache, heart palpitations, and insomnia.” People prone to feeling stress and anxiety tend to be especially sensitive to caffeine.10,11

## Alcohol

Alcohol produces chemical stress on the body. It also increases adrenal hormone output and interferes with both normal brain chemistry and normal sleep cycles. Although many people believe that alcohol has a calming effect, a study of 90 healthy male volunteers given either a placebo or alcohol demonstrated significant increases in anxiety scores after consumption of alcohol.10,11

## Refined Carbohydrates and Glycemic Volatility

One of the consequences of the stress response is abdominal fat cell growth and loss of muscle mass, a scenario that obviously leads to insulin resistance and obesity. It is a complex set of events orchestrated by cortisol released as a result of the stress response that is ultimately responsible for the fact that stress promotes weight gain. Cortisol is also a contributing factor in a high degree of glycemic volatility. Rapidly fluctuating blood sugar levels are generally related to some degree of insulin resistance and made worse by more-than-moderate consump- tion of foods with a high glycemic impact. Refined carbohydrates (e.g., sugar and white flour) are known to contribute to problems in blood sugar control, especially hypoglycemia, as well as glycemic volatility. The association between hypoglycemia and impaired mental func- tion is well known. Numerous studies have shown a high percentage of hypoglycemia in depressed patients.12,13 Because depression is one of the most common causes of anxiety, this finding provides a link between hypoglycemia and feelings of stress. Simply eliminating refined carbohydrates from the diet is occasionally all that is needed for effective therapy in patients who have depression or anxiety due to hypoglycemia.

## Potassium-to-Sodium Ratio

One of the key dietary recommendations to support the adrenal glands is to ensure adequate potassium levels within the body. This can best be done by consuming foods rich in potassium and avoiding foods high in sodium. Most Americans have a dietary K/Na ratio of less than 1:2. In contrast, most researchers recommend a dietary K/Na ratio higher than 5:1 for health. However, even this recommendation may not be optimal. A natural diet rich in fruits and vegetables can produce a K/ Na ratio higher than 50:1 because most fruits and vegetables have a K/ Na ratio of more than 100:1.

## Meal Planning

Mealtimes should be spent in a relaxed environment. As noted previ- ously, digestion is a process largely controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system. Eating in a rushed manner or in a noisy or hurried environment is not conducive to good digestion or good health.

## Food Allergies

People with symptoms of anxiety or chronic fatigue must be con- cerned about food allergies. As far back as 1930, pioneering allergist Albert Rowe began noticing that anxiety and fatigue were key features of food allergies.14 Originally, Rowe described a syndrome known as “allergic toxemia” to describe a syndrome that included the symptoms anxiety, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, drowsiness, difficulty concen- trating, and depression. Around the 1950s, this syndrome began to be referred to as the “allergic tension-fatigue syndrome.” Due to the popularity of chronic fatigue syndrome, many physicians and other people are forgetting that food allergies can lead to anxiety as well as chronic fatigue.

# NUTRITIONAL AND BOTANICAL SUPPORT

Nutritional and botanical support for the individual experiencing signs and symptoms of stress largely involves supporting the adrenal glands. Long-term stress and corticosteroids cause the adrenal glands to shrink and become dysfunctional, aggravating the stress symptoms of anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue. An abnormal adrenal response, either deficient or excessive hor- mone release, significantly alters an individual’s response to stress. Often, the adrenals become “exhausted” as a result of constant demands put on them. An individual with adrenal exhaustion usually experiences chronic fatigue and may complain of feeling “stressed out” or chronically anxious. He or she typically has reduced resistance to allergies and infection.

## Nutritional Supplements

The nutrients especially important for supporting adrenal function are vitamin C, vitamin B 6 , zinc, magnesium, and pantothenic acid. All of these nutrients play a critical role in the health of the adrenal gland as well as the manufacture of adrenal hormones. During stress, the levels of these nutrients in the adrenals decrease substantially. For example, during chemical, emotional, psychological, or physio- logical stress, the urinary excretion of vitamin C is increased. Examples of chemical stressors are cigarette smoke, pollutants, and allergens. Extra vitamin C in the form of supplementation and a higher intake of vitamin C–rich foods is often recommended to keep the immune system working properly during times of stress. Equally important during high periods of stress or in indi- viduals needing adrenal support is pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5 ). Pantothenic acid deficiency results in adrenal atrophy, char- acterized by fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, nausea, and abdominal discomfort. Pantothenic acid is found in whole grains, legumes, cauliflower, broccoli, salmon, liver, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes. In patients who have chronic stress or a history of cor- ticosteroid (prednisone) use, the typical level of supplementation is 100 to 500 mg/day. The appropriate daily dose of vitamin B 6 is 50 to 100 mg; of zinc, to 30 mg; and of magnesium, 250 to 500 mg.

## Gamma-aminobutyric Acid

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major neurotransmitter that is abundantly and widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. Low levels or decreased GABA function in the brain are associ- ated with several psychiatric and neurological disorders, but most pri- marily anxiety, depression, insomnia, and epilepsy. Currently, many popular antianxiety drugs—the sedative-hypnotics—interact primar- ily with GABA receptors. These drugs include the benzodiazepine drugs like alprazolam (Alprazolam, Xanax) and diazepam (Valium), as well as drugs like flurazepam (Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), temaze- pam (Restoril), triazolam (Halcion), zolpidem tartrate (Ambien), and baclofen (Kemstro and Lioresal). Clinical studies with PharmaGABA, a naturally manufactured sup- plement via a fermentation process that uses Lactobacillus hilgardii, have shown it to produce significant antistress effects.15,16 Specifically, PharmaGABA has been shown to produce relaxation, as evidenced by changes in brain-wave patterns, pupil diameter, and heart rate, as well as reduce markers of stress, including salivary cortisol and chromogr- anin A levels. These effects are thought to be the result of activation of the parasympathetic nervous system rather than PharmaGABA cross- ing the blood–brain barrier. The typical dosage is 100 to 200 mg up to three times daily. As a general guideline, it is recommended to take no more than 1000 mg within a 4-hour period and no more than 3000 mg within a 24-hour period.


Several botanical medicines support adrenal function. Most notable are the ginsengs—Chinese ginseng (Panax ginseng) and Siberian gin- seng (Eleutherococcus senticosus)—rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea), and ash- wagandha (Withania somnifera). All of these plants exert beneficial effects on adrenal function, enhance resistance to stress, and are often referred to as “adaptogens.” These plants have historically been used as follows: • To restore vitality in debilitated and feeble individuals • To increase feelings of energy • To improve mental and physical performance • To prevent the negative effects of stress and enhance the body’s response to stress Both Siberian and Chinese ginsengs possess this kind of equilibrat- ing, tonic, antistress action, and so the term adaptogen is quite appro- priate in describing their general effects. The ginsengs have been shown to enhance the ability to cope with various stressors, both physical and mental.17–19 Presumably, this antistress action is mediated by mechanisms that control the adrenal glands. Ginseng delays the onset and reduces the severity of the alarm- phase response of the general adaptation syndrome. People taking either of the ginsengs typically report an increased sense of well-being. Clinical studies have confirmed that both Siberian and Chinese ginsengs significantly reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. For example, in one double-blind clinical study, nurses who switched from day to night duty rated themselves for competence, mood, and general well-being and were given a test for mental and physical perfor- mance along with blood cell counts and blood chemistry evaluation.20 The group who were given P. ginseng demonstrated higher scores in competence, mood parameters, and mental and physical performance compared with those receiving placebos. The nurses taking the ginseng felt more alert yet more tranquil, and were able to perform better than the nurses who were not taking the ginseng. In addition to these human studies, several animal studies have shown the ginsengs to exert significant antianxiety effects. In several of these studies, the stress-relieving effects were comparable to those of diazepam (Valium); however, diazepam causes behavior changes, sedative effects, and impaired motor activity, but ginseng has none of these negative effects.21 On the basis of the clinical and animal studies, ginseng appears to offer significant benefit to people experiencing stress and anxiety. P. ginseng is generally regarded as being more potent than E. senticosus. P. ginseng is probably better for the patient who has experienced a great deal of stress, is recovering from a long-standing illness, or has taken corticosteroids, such as prednisone, for a long time. For the patient who is under mild to moderate stress and is experiencing less obvious impairment of adrenal function, E. senticosus may be the better choice. Another useful botanical medicine to support stress management is R. rosea (artic root), a popular plant in traditional medical systems in Eastern Europe and Asia, where it has traditionally been recom- mended to help combat fatigue and restore energy. Modern research has confirmed these effects and its qualities as an adaptogen. However, the adaptogenic actions of R. rosea are different from those of Chinese and Siberian ginsengs, which act primarily on the HPA axis. R. rosea seems to exert its adaptogenic effects by working on neurotransmit- ters and endorphins. R. rosea appears to offer an advantage over other adaptogens in circumstances of acute stress because it produces a greater feeling of relaxation and antianxiety effects. A single dose of Rhodiola extract before acute stressful events has been shown to pre- vent stress-induced disruptions in function and performance, but like the ginsengs, R. rosea has also shown positive results with long-term use.22–25 In one randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 60 patients with stress-related fatigue, Rhodiola was found to have an antifatigue effect that increased mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, as well as decreased the cortisol response to awakening stress.26 On the basis of the results of clinical trials with a standardized R. rosea extract, the therapeutic dose varies according to the rosavin con- tent. For a dosage target of 3.6 to 7.2 mg of rosavin, the daily dose would be 360 to 600 mg for an extract standardized for 1% rosavin, 180 to mg for 2% rosavin, and 100 to 200 mg for 3.6% rosavin. When R. rosea is used as an adaptogen, long-term administration is normally begun sev- eral weeks before a period of expected increased physiological, chemical, or biological strain and continued throughout the duration of the chal- lenging event or activity. When R. rosea is used as a single dose for acute

stress (e.g., for an examination or athletic competition), the suggested dose is three times the dose used for long-term supplementation. No side effects have been reported in the clinical trials, but at higher doses, some individuals might experience greater irritability and insomnia. Lastly, clinical studies with extracts of roots and leaves from Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) have shown considerable antistress and adaptogenic effects.27 In one human double-blinded study, chron- ically stressed subjects taking a proprietary extract (Sensoril) had significant reductions in a modified Hamilton anxiety scale, serum cortisol, C-reactive protein, pulse rate, and blood pressure and signif- icant increases of serum DHEA-S and hemoglobin compared with the placebo group. In addition, there were dose-dependent responses in lowering fasting blood glucose and improving the serum lipid levels. Dosage was 125 to 250 mg one to two times daily.28 In another dou- ble-blind study, 50 healthy male/female athletic adults were given a proprietary extract (KSM-66) at a dosage of 300 mg twice daily or a placebo for 12 weeks. Not only were quality-of-life scores significantly improved, but the ashwagandha extract also increased VO 2max com- pared with placebo at 12 weeks (5.67 and 1.86, respectively).29

## Stress Management Programs

Supervised stress management programs are thought to offer greater compliance and better results than unsupervised, patient-directed pro- grams. In one study, stress management experts evaluated six widely used occupational stress management interventions (relaxation, phys- ical fitness, cognitive restructuring, meditation, assertiveness training, and stress inoculation) on the basis of 10 practicality criteria and effectiveness objectives. They found that relaxation was the most prac- tical intervention and that meditation and stress inoculation were the least practical. Physical fitness was chosen to be the most effec- tive intervention, and both meditation and assertiveness training were rated overall as the least effective. What these results imply is that although relaxation training may be the most practical intervention, physical exercise was the most effective intervention.30 Meditation was shown to be the least practical and least effective method in this evaluation, but when it is part of a supervised program, it can be very effective. In one trial of 103 adults, 59% and 61% of the meditation and control groups, respectively, completed the study.31 The intervention program consisted of an 8-week group stress reduc- tion program in which subjects learned, practiced, and applied “mind- fulness meditation” to daily life situations. Those in the control group received educational materials and were encouraged to use community resources for stress management. Compared with the control group, intervention subjects reported significant decreases from baseline in effect of daily hassles (24%), psychological distress, (44%), and medi- cal symptoms (46%) that were maintained at the 3-month follow-up.

# Diseases

A big challenge in writing A Textbook of Natural Medicine is how to address the concept of disease. Although some disease names correlate well with the pathophysiology and are real entities—a good example is trichomoniasis, which is the result of a successful invasion by a pathological organism—most diseases are simply convenient names for grouped patterns of abnormal physiology. Focusing on the disease name implies it is a real entity separate from the natural body. This focus can obfuscate an understanding of what is actually happening with the patient’s physiology. A prime example is type 2 diabetes. Although loss of proper blood sugar control is the common denominator, the actual abnormal physiology could be due to a number of different underlying mechanisms, such as cellular insulin insensitivity, loss of pancreatic production of insulin, or hypercortisolemia, because there are multiple separate substantive dysfunctions—all with very different optimal inter- ventions—that result in loss of blood sugar control. Treating the disease by forcing a lowering of blood sugar may appear effective in the short term, but because the foundational underlying causes have not been addressed, the patient suffers pro- gressively worse sequelae. The failure to address these factors is a key reason why (at the time of this publication) diabetes and its complications account for an astounding 20% of healthcare spending in the United States. Nonetheless, because most clinicians and patients still have a disease diagnosis and treatment perspective, we address disease—but always in the context of the physiological abnormalities that are the actual causes of the patient’s ill health and symptoms. This section is both a therapeutic handbook and a study of the origins and causes of disease. Each disease is thoroughly discussed, with particular emphasis on the biochemistry of the altered physiology leading to the symptomatology and pathol- ogy. We also discuss, as appropriate, the aspects of genetics and lifestyle leading to the disorder. Finally, we present a compre- hensive therapeutic regimen using the most natural and least invasive therapies available. Although we believe this to be the most effective way to present the material, we are extremely concerned that it could continue to promote the disease orientation of the current dominant medical system. We can only offer the following sug- gestion: Always treat the patient, not the disease! All recommendations made here should be considered in the context of the whole patient. Our purpose is to help our patients to become well, not to simply alleviate symptoms and allow the true cause(s) of their disease to continue unabated. We therefore recommend that readers carefully study Sections I and IV before reading this section and that treatment pro- viders should always consider the psychological and spiritual reasons people may have for being sick.

## Organization

In general, each chapter is divided into the following five parts: • Diagnostic summary—brief list of the key diagnostic elements • General considerations—discussion of the underlying pathology and altered physiology • Therapeutic considerations—discussion of the correctable nutrient deficiencies, possible toxin causes, and various natural therapies that may be used to treat the underlying pathophysiology • Therapeutic approach—a concise therapeutic regimen • References—thorough documentation through peer-reviewed scientific research of the discussion to aid those who seek further study of our treatment rationale The section is arranged alphabetically by disease name. Please also use the Index to look for diseases because some are addressed in other disease chapters or within a grouping, and occasionally disease-naming conventions change. For example, depression is discussed in the chapter “Affective Disorders.” To aid us in the further development of this textbook, we welcome comments. In particular, we are greatly interested in well-documented successes, and failures, of the use of these procedures. We would also appreciate recommendations for therapeutic and diagnostic approaches not included here that have documented success.

## 1058SECTION 6 Diseases

Cosmetics, pomades, overwashing, and repetitive rubbing can produce acne as well. Chloracne is an acneiform eruption of blackheads, cysts, and nod- ules associated with exposure to halogenated aromatic compounds, including the dioxins. Most cases of chloracne have resulted from agri- cultural occupational exposures. However, nonoccupational chloracne has occurred from contaminated industrial wastes and contaminated food products and can accumulate in the human and animal food chains. The primary clinical manifestations of chloracne are nonin- flammatory comedones and straw-colored cysts that appear on the face (particularly the cheeks), neck, trunk, extremities, genitalia, and/ or axilla.3 The presence of chloracne is considered to be a clinical sign of dioxin exposure.

## Endocrinological Aspects

Acne is an androgen-dependent condition, and androgen excess, either systemic or local, is associated with more severe forms of the disease. Androgens control sebaceous gland secretion and exacerbate the development of abnormal keratinizing follicular epithelium. Endocrine disorders producing excess androgens are important etiological factors: idiopathic adrenal androgen excess, partial defect in 21-hydroxylase, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandroste- rone sulfate, and low sex-hormone-binding globulin levels have all been implicated.4–6 The skin of patients with acne shows greater activity of 5- α -reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to a more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone.7,8 This increased activ- ity is independent of systemic levels of androgens and may explain the poor correlation between systemic levels of androgens and the severity of acne lesions. Receptors for growth hormone and insu- lin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are present on the sebaceous gland, and these hormones also stimulate sebum production. Conditions of growth-hormone excess (e.g., acromegaly) are associated with increased sebum production and acne. Insulin at high levels can interact with IGF-1 receptors. IGF-1 promotes the expression of enzymes responsible for androgen biosynthesis and conversion. Elevated cortisol due to chronic stress thickens sebum. The stress of acne compounds this problem.


Effective treatment of acne is a significant clinical challenge. Success with natural treatments can be obtained only by the rigorous, compre- hensive application of dietary, nutritional, and botanical interventions. Guidelines for the management of acne were published in 2016 by the American Academy of Dermatology.9 Referring to these guide- lines may be instructive in making alternative natural medicine recommendations.


Although historically there was controversy regarding diet in the etiology of acne, there is now clear evidence of causality. In Western societies, acne vulgaris is a nearly universal skin disease afflicting 79% to 95% of the adolescent population. Among men and women older than 25 years, 40% to 54% have some degree of facial acne, and clinical facial acne persists into middle age in 12% of women and 3% of men. In contrast, epidemiological evidence suggests that acne incidence rates are considerably lower in non-Western soci- eties. For example, researchers found no cases of acne among the Kitavan Islanders of Papua New Guinea and the Ache hunter-gath- erers of Paraguay.10 The exact diet for acne sufferers to follow has not been evaluated, but foods high in iodine should be eliminated and milk consump- tion limited.11 Milk contains estrogens, progesterone, and andro- gens, as well as glucocorticoids and IGF-1.12 Trans-fatty acids and saturated fats should also be eliminated because they can increase sebaceous secretions and increase inflammation (Fig. 141.1). The composition of the diet should be in the range of 45% protein, 35% carbohydrate, and 20% fat because such a composition produces substantially less 5- α -reduction of testosterone and enhanced cyto- chrome P450 hydroxylation of estradiol, both therapeutic goals.13 A high-carbohydrate diet (10% protein, 70% carbohydrate, and 20% fat) has the opposite effect. A diet that encourages a high insulin response chronically can promote acne by resulting in elevated lev- els of IGF-1.14,15

## Sugar, Insulin, and Chromium

Many dermatologists have reported that insulin is effective in the treatment of acne, suggesting that impaired cutaneous glucose tolerance, insulin insensitivity, or both may contribute to acne lesions.16,17 In these studies, insulin was either given systemically (5–10 units two to three times a week) or injected directly into the lesions. One study comparing the results of oral glucose tolerance tests in acne patients showed no differences from controls. However, repet- itive skin biopsies revealed that the skin glucose tolerance was sig- nificantly impaired in patients with acne.18 One researcher coined the term skin diabetes to describe the disorder of acne.17 Considering the known immunosuppressive effects of sugar (see Chapter 136), all simple carbohydrates should be strictly eliminated. High-chromium yeast is known to improve glucose tolerance and enhance insulin sensitivity19 and has been reported in an uncontrolled study to induce rapid improvement in patients with acne.20 A review of the role of diet and acne published in 2014 reaffirmed that the contribution of diet in acne is not a myth.21 Moderate to severe acne is closely associated with the following: 1. Family history of acne in first-degree relatives 2. Obesity 3. High consumption of milk, particularly skim milk, cheese, and yogurt 4. Consumption of sweets/cakes, chocolate 5. Low consumption of fish 6. Limited intake of fruits and vegetables22 The higher content of omega-3 fatty acids in Kitavan and Ache’ societies may have also played a role in the absence of acne. Omega-3 contributes to maintaining the stratum corneum permeability barrier, maturation and differentiation of the stratum corneum, formation and secretion of lamellar bodies, and inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoids. A 2014 study showed for the first time that omega-3 fatty acids and gamma-linolenic acid could be used as adjuvant treatments for patients with acne.23

## Vitamin A

Many studies have demonstrated that retinols, including oral vitamin A, reduce sebum production and the hyperkeratosis of sebaceous folli- cles. Retinol has been shown to be effective in treating acne when used at high and potentially toxic dosages (i.e., 300,000–400,000 IU/day for 5–6 months).24 Although dosages of vitamin A below 300,000 IU/day for a few months rarely cause toxic symptoms,25 early recognition is

important. Cheilitis (chapped lips) and xerosis (dry skin) generally occur in most patients on high-dose vitamin A, particularly in dry weather. The first significant toxic symptom is usually headache, followed by fatigue, emotional lability, and muscle and joint pain. Laboratory tests appear unreliable for monitoring toxicity because serum vitamin A levels correlate poorly with toxicity, and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase are elevated only in symptomatic patients. Of far greater concern is the teratogenic- ity of massive dosages of vitamin A. Women of childbearing age must use effective birth control during treatment and for at least 1 month after discontinuation. Contraception counseling is mandatory, and two negative preg- nancy test results are required before the initiation of vitamin A therapy in women of childbearing potential. The baseline laboratory exam- ination should also include cholesterol and triglyceride assessment, hepatic transaminase levels, and a complete blood count. Pregnancy tests and laboratory examinations should be repeated monthly during treatment. In the author’s experience, vitamin A 150,000 IU daily in an emul- sified form has proven to be a reliable and safe means of bringing acne under control.


Zinc is involved in local hormone activation, retinol-binding pro- tein formation, wound healing, immune system activity, and tissue regeneration. Zinc supplementation in the treatment of acne has been the sub- ject of much controversy and many double-blind studies. Inconsistent results may be due to the differing absorbability of the various zinc salts used. For example, studies using effervescent zinc sulfate show efficacies similar to those of tetracycline, with fewer side effects from chronic use,26 whereas those using plain zinc sulfate have shown less beneficial results.27 The majority of patients required 12 weeks of sup- plementation before good results were demonstrated, although some showed dramatic improvement immediately. In another study, 66 patients with inflammatory acne were given zinc gluconate (30 mg elemental zinc) or placebo for 2 months.28 On Refined carbohydrates AR Sebum TG synthesis TG lipase Free C16:0Free C18:1 Disturbed keratinocyte ca2+ gradient ComedogenesisInflammation P. acnes growth biofilm and QS TH17IL-17IL-17 TG lipase C16:0C18:1Monounsaturated FAs PPARγLXRα IL-1β IL-1α ∆6DSCD SREBP1c InsulinInsulin

In the placebo group, the inflam- matory score dropped from 58 to 47 in the 2-month period, whereas in the treatment group, the score dropped from 49 to 27. Physicians rated 24 of 32 patients in the zinc group as responders compared with only of 34 in the placebo group. At least two additional double-blind studies with zinc gluconate provide additional support,29,30 but unfortunately, there have been no studies to date using better-absorbed forms of zinc, such as zinc pico- linate, citrate, acetate, or monomethionine. The importance of zinc to normal skin function is well recognized, especially considering the zinc-deficient syndrome acrodermatitis enteropathica. Zinc is essential for retinol-binding protein and thus for normal serum retinol levels.31 Although low levels of zinc increase 5- α -reduction of testosterone, high concentrations significantly inhibit this reaction.32 Serum zinc levels are lower in 13- and 14-year-old males than in any other age group.33

## Vitamin E and Selenium

Serum vitamin A levels in rats on vitamin E–deficient diets remain low regardless of the amount of oral or intravenous vitamin A supplementa- tion given. Serum levels return to normal after vitamin E is restored to the diet. Vitamin E has been shown to regulate retinol levels in humans. Male patients with acne have significantly decreased levels of erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, which normalizes with vitamin E and selenium treatment. Acne in both men and women improves with this treatment,34 likely due to inhibition of lipid peroxide for- mation, suggesting that the use of other free-radical quenchers may be beneficial.

## Pyridoxine

Women with premenstrual aggravation of acne often respond to vita- min B 6 supplementation, reflecting its role in the normal metabolism of steroid hormones.35 In rats, a vitamin B 6 deficiency appears to cause an increased uptake of and sensitivity to testosterone.36 However, this observation has never been replicated.

## Vitamins A and D

Interleukin-17 is induced by P. acnes and expressed in acne lesions. Vitamins A and D inhibit the genetic expression of P. acnes–induced Th17 differentiation.37,38

# TOPICAL TREATMENTS

Various topical gels, ointments, and creams containing natural products are available to treat acne. The goal of these preparations is the same as that of benzoyl peroxide (i.e., to reduce both the bacterial level and inflammation). Although there are many choices, the most popular for- mulas are those with tea tree oil, azelaic acid, vitamin C, or nicotinamide.

## Tea Tree Oil

Melaleuca alternifolia, or “tea tree,” is a small tree native to only one area of the world: the northeast coastal region of New South Wales, Australia. The leaves, the portions of the plant that are used medici- nally, are the source of a valuable therapeutic oil. Tea tree oil possesses significant antiseptic properties and is regarded by many as the ideal skin disinfectant. This claim is supported by its efficacy against a wide range of organisms (including 27 of strains of P. acnes)39 and its good penetration and lack of irritation to the skin (although cases of allergic reaction have been reported). The therapeutic uses of tea tree oil are based largely on its antiseptic and antifungal properties. In a study conducted at the Royal Prince Hospital in New South Wales, a 5% tea tree oil solution demonstrated similar beneficial effects as 5% benzoyl peroxide in acne, but with substantially fewer side effects.40 However, this 5% tea tree oil solution is probably not strong enough for moderate to severe acne. Stronger solutions (up to 15%) should provide even better results. Numerous studies have shown that tea tree oil is extremely safe for use as a topical antiseptic, but because it can occasionally produce contact dermatitis, a trial dose on a small area should be attempted first to ensure tolerability.

## Azelaic Acid

This naturally occurring nine-carbon dicarboxylic acid has exerted much pharmacological activity, including antibiotic activity against P. acnes. Clinical studies with 20% azelaic acid cream have shown it to produce results equal to those achieved with benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, and oral tetracycline.41 It has been shown to be effective in all forms of acne. To achieve benefits, azelaic acid must be applied to affected areas twice daily for a period of at least 4 weeks. Treatment should be continued for at least 6 months to maintain the benefits pro- duced after the first month. One review article found a topical cream containing 20% azelaic acid to be as effective as 5% benzoyl peroxide, 4% hydroquinone cream, 0.05% tretinoin, 2% erythromycin, and 0.5 to 1 g/day of oral tetracycline in ameliorating comedonal, papulopustular, and nodulo- cystic acne but less effective than oral isotretinoin at a dose of 0.5 to mg/kg per day in reducing cystic acne. The authors suggested that the few side effects of topical azelaic acid and lack of overt systemic toxicity made it a better choice for chronic use than other agents. The lower incidence of allergic sensitization, exogenous ochronosis, and residual hypopigmentation offers a clear advantage over conventional drugs.42

## Vitamin C

Sodium L-ascorbyl-2-phosphate 5% lotion is a stable vitamin C deriv- ative and highly effective antioxidant that has demonstrated statisti- cally significant improvement of acne compared with vehicle in all the parameters measured.43

<!-- chunk -->

## Nicotinamide

Topical nicotinamide inhibits the release of lysosomal enzymes, vaso- active amines, and the activity of P. acnes lipase. It is well tolerated, does not induce bacterial resistance, and has shown superior efficacy compared with 1% clindamycin gel for moderate inflammatory acne.44

## Proprietary Topical Therapy

A randomized, investigator-blinded, split-face 10-day study of an over-the-counter (OTC) botanical spot treatment gel containing 2% salicylic acid, Rheum palmatum, Portulaca oleracea, Scutellaria baical- ensis, Chrysanthemum indicum, Phellodendron amurense, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Sapindus mukorossi conducted in 2017 of 25 patients with mild to moderate acne found that after only five applications (over 36 hours), a dramatic reduction of visible acne, both inflamma- tory and noninflammatory lesions, was achieved.45

## New Natural Agents

In 2018 a Korean group of researchers reported their review of new natural products for the topical treatment of acne.46 Green tea has been found to improve acne by modulating intracellular targets and decreasing P. acnes. Lupeol, a constituent of Solanum melongena, and cannabdiol demon- strated sebum-reducing, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activi- ties. Lactobacillus fermented Chamaecyparis obtusa (a species of cypress) showed superiority compared with tea tree oil in a double-blind, ran- domized, controlled, split-face study.

of Gacinia mangostana, demonstrated improvement in acne severity score and inflammatory lesion counts when applied in a nanoparticle formulation.

# PROCEDURAL TREATMENTS

There is a growing interest in the nonmedical treatment of acne. Traditional acne procedures include comedone extraction, intrale- sional injections, epidermal exfoliation (cryotherapy, peels, micro- dermabrasion). More recent procedures include the use of various types of lights and lasers. Blue light may be anti-inflammatory, reduc- ing the cytokine-induced production of IL-1 alpha in keratinocytes.47

# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Psychological support may be necessary because depression is a com- mon occurrence in patients with acne, appearing twofold to threefold more often compared with the general population.48 In 1948 Sulzberger and Zaidens stated, “There is no single disease which causes more psy- chic trauma and more maladjustment between parents and children, more general insecurity and feelings of inferiority, and greater sums of psychic assessment than does acne vulgaris.”49 Acne has always been associated with emotional stress, but it is possible that the emotional stress also plays a role in the disease pro- gression. In the 1940s dermatologists John H. Stokes and Donald M. Pillsbury first proposed a gastrointestinal mechanism for the over- lap between depression, anxiety, and skin conditions such as acne.50 The doctors hypothesized that emotional states might alter the nor- mal intestinal microflora, increase intestinal permeability, and con- tribute to systemic inflammation. They also noted that as many as 40% of those with acne have hypochlorhydria and hypothesized that less than adequate stomach acid would set the stage for migration of bacteria from the colon toward the distal portions of the small intestine, as well as an alteration of normal intestinal microflora. The remedies these authors discussed to cut off the stress-induced cycle included administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus cultures long before they were known as probiotics. Many aspects of this gut–brain–skin unifying theory proposed by Stokes and Pillsbury have been validated (Fig. 141.2). The ability of the gut microflora and oral probiotics to influence systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, glycemic control, tissue lipid content, and even mood itself may have important implications in acne.51 Probiotic supplemen- tation is often indicated, especially given the common use of oral antibiotics to treat acne. A trial of 45 females randomized to one of three arms of acne treatment with and without probiotic supplementation found that at 8- and 12-week follow-up, the arm with a probiotic (containing L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum) and minocycline had a significant decrease in total lesion count ver- sus the groups with the probiotic (p < 0.001) or minocycline (p < 0.01) alone.52 Another randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 20 adults with acne given Lactobacillus rhamnosus or placebo for 12 weeks found a 32% reduction (p < 0.001) in acne in the probiotic group compared with placebo.53 The relationship between hypochlorhydria and acne was investi- gated in a large study of 13,000 adolescents with acne. An increased prevalence of halitosis, gastroesophageal reflux, bloating, and consti- pation was observed. Hypochlorhydria is a recognized risk factor in small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO has been detected on hydrogen breath testing in 5% of patients on long term pro- ton-pump inhibitor therapy.54 Fig. 141.2 Potential pathways of the gut–brain–skin axis in acne vulgaris. (1) Psychological distress alone or in combination with (2) high-fat diet and processed comfort foods devoid of fiber cause alterations to (3) gut motility and microbiota profile (4). Loss of normal microbial biofilm (Bifidobacterium in particular) causes intestinal permeability, and endotoxins gain systemic access (5). Burden of inflammation and oxidative stress is increased, substance P is elevated, and insulin sensitivity is decreased due to endotoxemia (6). In those genetically susceptible to acne vulgaris, this cascade increases the likelihood of excess sebum production, exacerbations in acne, and additional psychological distress. Both probiotics and antimicrobials may play a role in cutting off this cycle at the gut level. (From Bowe WP, Logan AC. Acne vulgaris, probiotics and the gut-brain-skin axis—back to the future?

## 1062SECTION 6 Diseases


Acne is a multifactorial disease requiring an integrated therapeu- tic approach to avoid toxicity and adverse effects during treatment. Patients should be checked for treatable causes and underlying hor- monal abnormalities before specific therapies are initiated. The most effective acne medication is isotretinoin, a derivative of vitamin A. It is approved only for severe and recalcitrant nodulo- cystic acne. Concern over the safety and of this drug is widespread. Specifically, reports of intracranial hypertension, depression, and sui- cidal ideation with isotretinoin use have prompted an examination of its serious and life-threatening potential risk. A warning is attached to its product label for signs of depression and suicidal ideation, and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–mandated registry exists for all individuals prescribing, dispensing, or taking isotretinoin. This regis- try aims to further decrease the risk of pregnancy and other potentially dangerous adverse effects during a course of isotretinoin therapy.

# DIAGNOSIS

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression

Characterized by periods of low mood, sadness and anhedonia, depres- sion is broadly grouped into: • Major depression: Characterized by persistent sad feelings that leave a person unable to functional normally. This is also known as unipolar depression. • Dysthymia: A persistent chronic form of mild depression that typi- cally allows a person to function at some level, but he or she gener- ally feels somewhat sad and often will still lose interest in activities that would typically be pleasurable. • Seasonal affective disorder: Low mood or sad feelings that occur during a certain time of year. Typically, this time is during the fall into wintertime, when the hours of daylight decreases.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiety

Anxiety disorders are characterized by extreme nervousness and feelings of fear. Anxiety disorders are further grouped into these types: • Generalized anxiety disorder, which has symptoms that include or more months of exaggerated fears, worry, and general emotional tension. • Obsessive compulsive disorder, which is type of anxiety where a person has repetitive images, ideas, and bodily feelings (called obsessions) that drive the person to display behaviors and actions in response (these are the compulsions). • Panic disorder, which is a type of anxiety in which intense and often sudden anxiety results in a person being overwhelmed by these feel- ings and unable to function normally. • Posttraumatic stress disorder, which is anxiety that follows a trauma or major stressor, when a person often has repeated thoughts of an event or subsequent disturbing anxiety that can be triggered by something that reminds the person of the originating event. • Social anxiety, which involves an anxiety with a main feature in which a person’s worry, often regarding other people’s judgment or evaluation, leaves him or her unable to function in a social situ- ation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder can include feelings of mania (excessive elation and positivity) and/or feelings of low mood and depression. The types of bipolar disorders are: • Bipolar I, characterized by manic symptoms that either last 7 days or are so severe the person require some type of hospitalization or restraint for the patient’s safety or the safety of others. Depressive episodes are periods of depression that last 2 weeks and may inter- change with the symptoms of mania. • Bipolar II, featuring symptoms of depression along with hypoma- nia, which is a subtler form of mania that usually does not require restraint or hospitalization. • Cyclothymia, a milder form of bipolar disorder, in which there may be 2-year cyclical occurrences of elevated mood and eupho- ria (hypomanic symptoms) and depressive symptomology.

# CAUSAL CONSIDERATIONS

## Stress and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis

<!-- chunk -->

## Dysfunction

Although stress is universally recognized as a major player in affec- tive disorder, the definition of stress varies wildly among physicians. Furthermore, there is little agreement on the best ways to handle stress. Hungarian endocrinologist Hans Selye first used the term “stress” when he defined it as a “non-specific strain on the body caused by irregular- ities in normal body functions. This stress resulted in the release of hormones.”9 Stressors can take many different forms: changes in envi- ronmental milieu, weather, social structure, and interpersonal inter- action. The stress response can also be initiated as a result of feeling preyed on by onset of new illness, from exposure to toxins, and even by food sensitivity. Stress results in prefrontal cortex activity sending signals to the amygdala, the fear center of the limbic system. The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing and will modify activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing levels of corti- cotropin-releasing hormone (CRH); will upregulate inflammation and the cytokine cascade; and will reset downstream glucocorticoid sensi- tivity.10 See Fig. 142.1. Raised levels of CRH are known to have neurotoxic effects.11 As the final common pathway in the stress response, CRH is released to the hypothalamus and feeds directly to the anterior pituitary and ini- tiates adrenocorticotropin release (ACTH). ACTH travels through the bloodstream and initiates adrenal cortex release of cortisol.12 CRH and ACTH production is augmented when the hypothalamic paraventric- ular neurons are chronically activated. Oxytocin counters this effect. Although cortisol will negatively feed back through the action of min- eralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors to exert negative feedback on the hippocampus, the pituitary, and the hypothalamus,13 chronic stress encourages glucocorticoid resistance and allows the stress response to continue. According to McEwen, during a stressor the CNS and the body communicate in a bidirectional fashion via the endocrine, immune, and autonomic systems.14 In the short term, these responses are beneficial because they serve to promote physiological and psycho- logical survival. In the midterm, regulatory processes, behaviors, and physiology are challenged, but functioning remains relatively normal. In the long term, consistent experience of stress, fear, and/ or trauma, and the body’s attempts at homeostasis will contribute to the chronic negative effects of chronic stress and behavioral changes that encourage unhealthy lifestyles and illness15 and support the var- ied mechanisms of anxiety and mood disorders. Bruce McEwen’s research team created the new term “allostatic load” to recognize the parallel healthful and noxious results of the stress response. Although allostatic load works to dynamically rebalance, it can, at the same time, damage tissues, deplete reserves, and encourage development of affective disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other illnesses.

## 1065CHAPTER 142 Affective Disorders

One notable type of stress is social stress that induces physio- logical effects that block healing. For example, animals exposed to long-term social subordination will present with altered HPA set points, ineffective hippocampal survival, glucocorticoid resistance, cognitive changes, withdrawal behavior, and low- ered immune status in the effort to produce coping mechanisms to the stressor.16,17 All these precipitate and maintain affective disorders. This animal research has been duplicated in humans. For exam- ple, a San Francisco Federal Reserve study noted that the highest rates of suicide occur among nonaffluent people who live in affluent areas. This study strongly correlated a sense of low worth and utility when individuals’ relative income is less than those around them.18 When social stress creates low self-esteem, affective disorders thrive. Patients under social stress may need significantly more support to help regain mental health.

## Disordered Sleep

Adequate sleep is critical for repair, healing, and detoxification. During sleep, inflammation is balanced, mitochondria are recycled and cre- ated, neurons regenerate, the hormonal system resets, and the digestive tract cleans and repairs. Without proper sleep, balancing mood is near impossible due to deficiencies and imbalances in all these processes. Poor sleep predicts worse outcomes in depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.19 Clinicians often find it challenging to ascertain whether sleep disturbances are a precursor to or a sequelae of mood disorder. Sleep is bidirectionally related to mood disturbance, as poor sleep will raise the stress response. Increased stress response will con- tribute to poor sleep. Research shows us that sleep challenges occur in bipolar stages and will exert a negative effect on disease course, life quality, and treatment outcomes.20 The clinician should identify and treat any insomnia, REM-sleep concerns, and sleep apnea. Typical underlying causes for sleep problems include excessive stimulants; psychological stress; high levels of stress hormones (such as cortisol and norepinephrine); disrupted circadian rhythms; low levels of serotonin or melatonin; imbalances in estrogens and progesterone, which affect neurotransmitter production; dyglycemias; and digestive upheaval.

## Sunlight, Spending Time in Nature, and Light Therapy

The benefits of light exposure are threefold: to maintain healthy levels of serotonin, support circadian rhythm, and to increase levels of vita- min D in the body. Vitamin D is produced through exposure to ultraviolet B rays, which transform skin 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D 3. One report suggests a 12-minute exposure of 50% of body skin to noon- time sun on a clear day is equivalent to oral intake of 3000 IU of vitamin D 3 .21 Supplemental vitamin D is discussed in a subsequent section of this chapter. Interestingly, a study over a 2.3-year period of 198 patients with multiple sclerosis found that sunlight exposure, and not vitamin D levels, are best correlated with mood and fatigue symptoms.22 Although ultraviolet B’s ability to make vitamin D may be important, sunlight’s infrared wavelengths may play a sep- arate and distinct role in mood. Animal research shows the amount of time until an animal will “give up” and become depressed after continuous stress is increased significantly after 4 weeks’ exposure to infrared irradiation, suggesting that application of infrared irradia- tion has an antidepressant effect.23 Humans are animals designed to spend time in nature. Natural areas like forests are shown to have calming and balanc- ing effects on the body. The Japanese practice of forest bathing, called shinrin yoku, lowers adrenaline levels and improves natu- ral killer cell activity.24 Studies of postsurgical patients show that those given exposure to a window with a nature view had a better mood, shorter hospital stays, and fewer complications.25 Patients exposed to houseplants show lowered blood pressures, less pain, and less fatigue and anxiety than individuals in the rooms without plants.26 Also known as bright light therapy exposure, phototherapy has been shown to block the negative mood effects of acute tryptophan depletion.27 Phototherapy, or light-box therapy, is most often used in seasonal affective disorder. Typical light-box therapy involves using a 10,000-lux, full-spectrum white light for at least 30 minutes every morning. Light boxes with smaller power do not seem to provide the same benefit as the 10,000-lux devices. Meta-analysis of light therapy studies showed that enough high-quality studies to confirm benefit are lacking. Nevertheless, in my clinical experience, I see clearly beneficial changes in mood. Once again, modern research documents the efficacy of founda- tional naturopathic concepts of health and healing through sun and nature exposure.


Known since Hippocrates’ time to elevate mood, exercise can help regenerate and protect the brain areas needed for stable temperament and optimal cognition. Movement and exercise assist the brain glial cells to produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is responsible for the regeneration and repair of the CNS. Exercise has also been identified to increase hippocampal volume.28 Low levels of exercise have been linked to lowered life quality, poor physical function, and mood symptoms.29 The literature regarding the effect of exercise as an intervention for major depression and bipolar disorder has shown comparable effect sizes.30 Exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety, counter depression, and improve negative mood, while simultaneously improving self-esteem and even memory.31 Other research also suggests the efficacy of exercise-augmentation strategies added to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders.32 Often, mood disorders like bipolar and depression present with a strong lack of motivation and interest. These symptoms can make implementing an exercise schedule a challenge. As such, for some patients, it may be best to proffer an exercise protocol that is gentle and does not cause discomfort, especially if patients have concomitant fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. For fitness, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends 5 days a week of moderate to vigorous exercise for 30 minutes—but cli- nicians may want to start the patients with mood disorder on a lighter schedule if their energy is not vital or they are new to exercise.33 Although not as common, excess exercise may also result in dam- aging changes to mental health. Some patients become excessively dependent on physical activity and exercise, where excess activity can

cause both disturbances in mood and worsened physical health.34 Extremely heavy or exhaustive exercise can promote exercise-in- duced mitochondrial dysfunction, a condition where mitochondria suffer due to nutrient deficiencies, excess reactive oxygen species, and metabolic toxicity, which contribute to neurodegeneration.35 Heavy exercise may also lead to adrenal fatigue, recognized as an Addison’s disease type of overtraining syndrome.36 In this situation, the adrenal glands cannot competently produce sufficient hormone levels, and the body and mind suffer.

## Blood Sugar Dysregulation

Balanced blood sugar is key for mood regulation, whereas dysgly- cemia (recurrent episodes of either too many lows or highs) will contribute to affective disorders. Research on patients with dia- betes suggests good blood sugar control supports healthy mood and good judgment.37 Hypoglycemia-prone patients are known to be at greater risk for depression. Dysglycemia has been shown to contribute to smaller hippocampal and cortical volumes in bipo- lar disorder.38 A study from Johns Hopkins evaluated lung injury patients in an intensive care unit and noticed that subjects who had low blood sugar of under 60 nanograms (normal is 80 to ng) were at a 360% increase risk of depression 3 months later.39 Associations between anxiety and insulin resistance have been established. Converse to hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia also contributes to mood disorders. Studies of patients with diabetes are clear that high-blood– sugar episodes will deteriorate mood, instigate cognitive difficultly, and most notably increase sadness and anxiety.40 People with hyper- glycemia or high insulin are also predisposed to depression. A study of young adults in their late 20s and early 30s showed that when blood sugar or insulin was too high, the chances of becoming depressed was 150% to 200% as high.41 Higher rates of bipolar disorder exist among patients with diabetes as well.42 Balancing blood sugar requires quality sleep, lower stress response, and healthy eating. The tenets of blood sugar control include balanced protein intake, healthy fat intake, and consuming healthy carbohy- drates while minimizing simple carbohydrates and sugary foods. Small frequent meals can be very helpful for many patients to abate fluctu- ations that lead to mood changes as noted in the next section. One supplement that can help is chromium, which will be discussed in the mineral section later in this chapter.

## Maldigestion

Healthy digestion is critical for mood management. In 1999 Michael Gershon’s book, The Second Brain, set forth a “new” perspective (almost a century earlier, naturopathic pioneer Otis Carroll, ND, asserted that disease begins in the bowels) regarding the digestive system, seeing it not just as a means for nutrient absorption and elimination but also as a neuroendocrine organ43 that partners in a bidirectional relationship with the CNS. Evidence shows that bowel disorders are correlated with disruptions in mood. In fact, almost two thirds of patients with anxiety and depression are described to have intestinal function disturbance, such as irritable bowel syn- drome (IBS).44 Almost one third of patients with major depression are thought to have constipation, and patients with IBS are more prone to both anxiety disorders as well as depression than are indi- viduals who do not have IBS.45 Looking at 136 patients with bipolar disorder versus matched controls, investigators found a strong asso- ciation between mood and gut symptoms. Interestingly, their study also showed that patients with bipolar disorder with minimal mood symptoms typically do not have more gastrointestinal symptoms ver- sus control subjects.46 There are also case reports of anxiety and panic attacks in patients before diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.47 Although the reason is unclear, I have seen very direct clinical associations between pancreatic inflammation, high levels of amylase and lipase, and anxiety and mood disorders. This bidirectional relationship is in part due to the vitality and composition of the microbiota of the digestive tract, where, researchers suggest, estimates of these bacteria outnumber human cells by an order of 10. The dynamics of the microbiome ultimately affect synthesis of neurotransmitters and metabolites. The microbiome regulates vagus nerve activation and also modulates immunological consequences. Emerging studies in both animals and human subjects suggest pertur- bations in the microbiome are also key factors in altered gut health. Animal studies have shown alterations create changes in production of BDNF in the hippocampus and amygdala as well as behavioral changes.48 Furthermore, stress will alter the microbiome, and the microbiome will alter function of the HPA axis, leading to reregulation of the stress response.49 Evidence suggests that microbiome alterations from antibiotics may also predispose individuals to bipolar disorder, and patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder with more severe symp- tomology seem to have altered microbiomes that differ from those of healthy controls.50

## Inflammation

Inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6 are typically raised in sit- uations of anxiety,51 depression,52 and bipolar disorder.53 The major- ity of the body’s immune system is housed in digestive tract, where it resides as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Stress and poor digestion lead to inflammatory acti- vation. Food sensitivities and food allergens can also trigger inflam- mation in the body. High-glycemic foods also trigger release of excess insulin. Increased chronic levels of insulin leads to insulin resistance, which is also shown to drive inflammation.54 As discussed earlier, imbalances in the microbiome will also upregulate inflammatory cytokines and interleukins. A digestive tract full of Candida albicans (yeast), and all the toxins associated with it, may also contribute to mood disorder. Presence of yeast will alter the ability to absorb nutrients and push hypersensitivity reactions of toxin by-products, which translates to inflammation in the body.55 Inflammation will greatly contribute to depression, anxiety, and poor mental function. Chronic inflammation in the digestive tract can lead to gut perme- ability, which is often referred to as “leaky gut.” The concept suggests that other structure and repair mechanisms of the digestive tract are compromised over time. With an inflammatory fire partially driven by an imbalance in microbiota, tight junctions deteriorate. When these structures break down, luminal materials gain greater access to the bloodstream. These leaked particles travel through the hepatic por- tal system and spur upregulation of hepatic Kupffer cells, which can trigger brain inflammation via microglia activation. Inflammation in the brain will result in activation of the HPA axis, lowered serotonin, higher anxiety, and higher glucocorticoid resistance. Over time, higher cortisol levels contribute to brain degeneration and poor mood. The likelihood of this cascade of events is far greater than if the intestines are intact.56 See Fig. 142.2.57 Leaky gut has been a term all but mocked in conventional care circles until relatively recently, where reviews of the literature show connections not only between leaky gut and more direct inflam- matory issues like autoimmunity58 but also with cardiovascular

disease,59 kidney disease,60 and psychiatric concerns.61 Out of the purview of this chapter, but covered in Chapter 19 Intestinal Permeability, practitioners should consider that a patient with affective disorder may greatly benefit by testing and treatment of gut permeability.

## Hormonal Imbalances

The endocrine system plays a strong role in the signaling and function of the nervous system and inflammatory response. Undoubtedly, it is a contributor to mood disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Hormones

Thyroid hormones affect virtually every cell body, and imbalances will contribute to affective disorder. Most notably, hyperthyroid- ism can contribute to overt feelings of anxiety and mania in bipolar disorder, and low levels will contribute to low mood and depres- sion.62,63 Regarding the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT), high-stress states and allostatic load will also alter the thyroid axis, whereby high levels of ACTH affect levels of thyroid-releasing factor and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Repeated and chronic stress can lower serum levels of tetraiodothyronine (T4).64 Glucocorticoid levels will also influence the de-iodinase enzyme that peripherally converts T4 to the three times more active triiodothyronine (T3).65 T3 augmentation has been shown valuable in treating patients with depression that is resistant to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment.66

<!-- chunk -->

## Cortisol

Cortisol is the major glucocorticoid for mediating the stress response. Imbalances in HPA axis function and adrenal production, as seen in treatment-resistant depression, are evidenced by higher cortisol-to- dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) ratios.67 Cortisol and stress cat- alyze activation of tryptophan oxygenase, resulting in the delivery of less tryptophan to the brain. In addition, cortisol downregulates serotonin receptors in the brain, making them less sensitive to the serotonin that is available. In studies on depression and cortisol levels, particularly the awakening response (CAR), depression itself has also been associated with both increased and lowered or blunted (nonsig- nificant, nominal change in) CAR. In my experience, cortisol levels throughout the day will be more often dysregulated in patients with affective disorders. This dysregulation can manifest as high levels of cortisol, low levels of cortisol, or varying levels throughout the day, including low early morning and afternoon levels and high nighttime and early morning levels. Assessing cortisol levels via saliva or urine testing can help the practitioner determine an individual patient’s adrenal profile.

## Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate

Considered a “neurosteroid,” DHEA and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAs) are molecules produced by the adrenal gland. Low DHEA levels are related to symptoms and severity of depression and anxiety.68 DHEA may protect against the adverse effects of stress, especially with regard to the brain atrophy caused by chronically high levels of cortisol. Like exercise, DHEA can increase neuronal growth in the hippocampus and will protect new nervous tissue from being destroyed by stress hormones. Higher levels are likely present in bipolar disorder.69 Generally, supplementation when low is helpful. A 2014 literature review looked at 22 studies, finding DHEA supple- mentation is helpful for depressive symptoms overall.70 One case in the literature suggested 150 to 200 mg per day of DHEA may have contributed to acute mania onset in a patient with a history of these episodes.71

<!-- chunk -->

## Testosterone

DHEA metabolizes into testosterone. High levels of testosterone are associated aggression, impulsivity, compulsiveness, and paranoia. Testosterone increases monoamine oxidase (MAO) and decreases catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT), an enzyme responsible for breakdown of both neurotransmitters and estrogens. Low testoster- one levels can contribute to fatigue, depression, flat mood, and mood swings, as well as sleep disorders; high levels can also contribute to depression.72 SSRIs are known to lower levels of testosterone and negatively affect libido. Testosterone administration in 15 females reported reductions in unconscious fears in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial,73 suggesting that low levels may partic- ipate in difficulty conquering anxiety. Concerning bipolar disorder, testosterone levels are notably lower for male patients in comparison with controls, whereas women with bipolar disorder had significantly

higher testosterone levels versus female controls.74 Again, assessing individual profiles to help balance levels in each patient is important for optimal care.

<!-- chunk -->

## Estrogen

As a prime mood-enhancing hormone, estrogen is important to both male and female brain function. The highest density of estro- gen receptors are in the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and dorsal raphe, where most of the brain serotonin is produced. Estrogens (primarily estradiol) will affect brain estrogen receptor activation, which affects all neurotransmitter levels, with a prefer- ence for supporting serotonin and dopamine levels. Estrogen also lowers levels of MAO.75 Conversely, low estrogen levels increase activation of MAO activity, which will lower levels of neurotrans- mitters and can contribute to affective disorders. However, research regarding replacement of estrogens as a monotherapy to help mood are equivocal or found it to be even possibly detri- mental to cognition.76 A number of studies and case reports reveal mood benefits, especially in depression. Studies also show estrogen therapy may augment antidepressants’ efficacy in treatment-resis- tant cases.77 It seems that in the right patient, testing levels and considering natural hormone-replacement therapy might be valuable.

<!-- chunk -->

## Progesterone

Acting more yin to estrogen’s yang, progesterone is generally a more calming hormone that can work by limiting estrogen’s ability to support serotonin. Allopregnanolone is a metabolite of proges- terone that also affects gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) activity to drive progesterone’s calming effect. HPA axis activation resulting in higher levels of cortisol will lower production of progesterone. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 17 patients documented a clear anxiolytic and lowered irritability effect of progesterone vaginal suppositories (200 mg twice a day) without changes in blood levels of the hormone.78 Progesterone is also a valuable sleep ally that does not change undisturbed sleep but can restore normal sleep when sleep is disturbed.79

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxytocin

Oxytocin is a hormone that also acts as a neurotransmitter. It is best associated with feelings of love, meaningful touch, cuddling, and com- bating anxiety. People with higher comfort levels in social situations and who trust are able to release appropriate amounts of oxytocin, whereas people who have social anxiety disorder often have dysregu- lated oxytocin. Oxytocin reduces amygdala hyperactivity and blocks the percep- tion of a threatening environment. High levels of oxytocin are con- sistent with bonding experiences, regular community interaction, and consistent social engagement. Known to be low in people with depres- sion and anxiety,80 oxytocin may be a reasonable trait marker for bipo- lar disorder as well.81 Intranasal administration is shown to enhance social abilities in children with autism82 and has shown antidepressant properties in rats. No clinical trials for depressed humans have been published as of this writing.83 Oxytocin may be one of the reasons pets improve mood; it is released by petting a dog.84 More oxytocin-raising suggestions are given in the nutrigenomics section of this chapter.

## Melatonin

Melatonin is hormone that acts as a powerful antioxidant and is involved with detoxification and immune function. Melatonin facil- itates sleep by lowering body temperature and inducing drowsiness. Deficient or delayed melatonin levels may contribute to depression85,86 and anxiety.87 Delayed bedtime will encourage the stress response and suppress melatonin. Studies showing supportive effects for melatonin supplementation as a monotherapy for affective disorders, including bipolar, are lacking.88 Time-released melatonin has shown benefit to support sleep and reduce fatigue in depressed patients.89 Although melatonin itself has not been shown as successful in alleviating mood disorders on its own, supplemental melatonin has been shown to help improve sleep quality and quantity in depressed patients90 and will likely help a patient with mood disorder ultimately heal by improving sleep.

## Lifestyle Factors: Smoking, Alcohol, and Caffeine

A health-promoting lifestyle and diet are important in the treatment of depression. Particularly important are the cessation of smoking, exces- sive alcohol consumption, and caffeine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Smoking

Smoking upregulates cortisol levels, leading to HPA axis and adrenal dysregulation, a feature of affective disorders. Cigarette smoking also leads to a relative vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is concentrated in adrenal glands, so adrenal function is likely compromised, which can contribute to depression.91 Early life smoking neurodevelop- mentally encourages anxiety and other mood disorders later due to increases in inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dys- function.92 Individuals with bipolar disorder are up to 300% more likely to smoke and are far less likely to initiate or maintain smoking cessation.93

<!-- chunk -->

## Alcohol

Alcohol is a potent nervous system depressant that also wreaks havoc with blood sugar regulation, leading to cravings and hypo- glycemic episodes (see section on blood sugar imbalances). Interestingly, alcohol seems to stabilize GABA, which may be why alcohol has a temporary calming effect.94 Chronic alcohol ingestion also leads to multiple vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Patients with alcoholism often have a deficiency in the delta-6 desaturase enzyme, which is responsible for the conversion of linoleic acid to the omega-6 fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid, a precursor to pros- taglandin E1 (PGE1). PGE1 helps maintain neurotransmitter levels in the brain to support positive mood and a calm sense. Alcohol may also temporarily stimulate production of PGE1 and help lift mood.95 If delta-6 desaturase is impaired for any reason, mood can decline—usually more toward depression. Excess sugar intake, high insulin levels, coffee, and trans-fatty acids can all lower inhibit desaturase activity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Caffeine

Caffeine is the most frequently consumed psychoactive drug in the world. Found in coffee, green tea, and black tea, caffeine may be beneficial or antagonistic to mood disorders. According to a meta-analysis of 11 studies with more than 300,000 people, a range of caffeine intake between 68 mg per day and 509 mg per day (approximately ¾ cup to 6 cups of coffee a day) reduces depression, whereas more can promote depression and suicidal thoughts.96 In most cases, anxious patients are aggravated by caffeine, although in practice I recognize a subset of anxious patients who can actually benefit from caffeine intake, likely due to it raising low levels of dopamine. Caffeine acts on the neurotransmitter system by antago- nizing adenosine receptors, which initiates a cascade that increases glutamate, cortisol, dopamine, and epinephrine. Generally, for any- one who has suspected depleted adrenal function, as evidenced by

low cortisol or DHEA, or for a person with high levels of epineph- rine or dopamine, coffee is not recommended—especially if she or he is not sleeping well.

## Digital Screen and Social Media Exposure

Although electronics are an important part of our everyday lives, exposure to these large and small screens may be playing a role in the increased levels of affective disorders in our society. Functional MRI studies have shown that short-term use of television may have a relaxing effect on brain insular cortex and amygdala regions,97 whereas moderate or severe depression level was associated with higher amounts of time spent on TV watching and use of computers for more than 6 hours a day98 (although this seems like a lot of time, it is not really much considering the millions of students and working people who spend the majority of their time looking at a computer screen—as I do). An analysis of more than 30 years of U.S. national data of 30,000 adults corroborates this, showing that spending time watching television may contribute to viewers’ happiness in the short- term moment, but unhappy people watch far more TV than happy people do.99 Regarding social media, an online survey of 1730 U.S. adults ages 19 to 32 suggested those who classified themselves as “wired” and “connected” (versus “diffuse dabblers,” “concentrated dab- blers,” and “unplugged”) greatly increased the likelihood of anxiety and depression symptoms. Smartphone addiction is cor- related with depression.100 Dependence on media may likely cre- ate changes in the dopamine- reward system similar to the changes opioids and other drugs of addiction may cause, as loss of devices such as a smartphone may create feelings of panic, anxiety, or withdrawal. Younger adults seem to be more affected by media and smartphone addiction in terms of anxiety and depression. Besides being causative, use of devices may encourage an under- lying trait. For example, someone with social phobia might avoid in-person contact by using the phone, and/or someone with OCD traits may manifest by using his or her phone to check things repeatedly.101 It should also be noted that, when used wisely, computers and media can aid those with anxiety and depression. Research shows the effectiveness of Internet-based CBT (ICBT) in treat- ing and controlling psychiatric illnesses, including depression, GAD and social anxiety, panic disorders, phobias, addiction and substance-use disorders, adjustment disorder, bipolar dis- order, and OCD, and ICBT may be quite cost effective for many patients.102

## Environmental Toxicity

Toxic metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, nickel, and alumi- num) as well as solvents (e.g., cleaning materials, formaldehyde, toluene, and benzene), pesticides, herbicides, and mold toxins all have an affinity for nervous tissue. The oxidative stress from these neurotoxins can substantially contribute to mitochondrial dysfunc- tion (see next section). As a result, various psychological and neu- rological symptoms can occur, including anxiety and depression as well as headaches, extremity tingling, and abnormal nerve function. For example, social and emotional challenges in children correlate with pre- and postnatal exposure to lead.103 Methylmercury expo- sure will produce mitochondrial dysfunctions via oxidative stress and downregulation of tryptophan hydroxylase, the enzyme needed to produce proper amounts of serotonin.104 Surveys of residents of eight European cities revealed dampness and mold is associated 30% increased depression.105 (For a comprehensive discussion of the large body of research on neurotoxins and mood disorders, see Crinnion and Pizzorno, Environmental Medicine, Elsevier 2018.)

## Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Mitochondria are the considered “the powerhouse of the cell” and are absolutely vital to mental health. These organelles create ATP molecules from glucose molecules needed for maintenance of the sodium and potassium pumps that keep the electrical gradient that is responsible for neuronal depolarization. Mitochondrial dysfunc- tion is responsible for low ATP stores that lead to lack of ATP, which leads to generation of reactive oxygen species, neuroinflammation, and eventual neurodegeneration via apoptosis.106 Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized for its association with neu- ropsychiatric abnormalities such as dementia, major depression, and bipolar disorder.107 ATP production is greatly decreased, and mito- chondrial DNA deletions are increased in major depression.108,109 Mitochondrial dysfunction may be most salient when considering natural treatments for bipolar disorder,110 which seems more cor- related with mitochondrial dysfunction than the other affective disorders. Mitochondria are damaged by poor sleep, insufficient or excessive exercise, excess stress, toxins (heavy metals, solvents, herbicides, and mold), drugs, chronic hyperglycemia, dysinsulinemia, inflammation, and poor nutrition. In a way, this damage encompasses all we discuss in this chapter. Work on sleep, exercise, and stress balance and removing toxic load is needed for mitochondrial healing. Supplemental strategies include consumption of B vitamins to help Krebs cycle function and fish oil to support mitochondrial dynamics.111 Foods and supple- ments that support Phase I and II liver detoxification can help when there’s a strong toxicity picture. In addition, direct mitochondrial supports may include carnitine, CoQ10, lipoic acid, glutathione, and nicotinamide. I often prescribe N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), because it encourages oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial membrane integrity, and homeostasis of the mitochondrial milieu. Selenium deficiency and poor antioxidant status will contribute to mitochon- drial dysfunction and should be considered.112 These supplements are only a partial list, because there are many other evidenced-based supplements I might use, depending on the particulars of a patient’s case. I will also recommend hypericum for mitochondria-related depression to help improve mood and promote neuronal mitochon- dria regeneration.113


Nowhere more than in the field of mental health is it paramount that the health care practitioner understand the wide breadth and range of factors that can result in an affective disorder. This chapter touches on topics covered throughout the rest of this book. The keen mental health practitioner knows mental health challenges can be symptoms of both psychological and physiological imbalance and should view mood symptoms as an opportunity and a necessity to check in on the multiple body systems and physiology along with a patient’s psycho- logical concerns. This section will review those major factors to help best treat the patient.

## Conventional Medications

With the number of filled prescriptions for affective disorders soaring, patients are often overmedicated, using pharmaceutical compounds that do not address the underlying causes, and in

many cases create a situation that can inhibit true healing. When possible due to the mental health symptoms. When a person is inca- pacitated due to mental illness, these changes may not be possible. In this case a drug may be the best lifesaving option if it can create a fast “switch” that affords the patient the ability to start to take care of herself or himself. Once a patient is feeling better with medica- tion, he or she can start working on the underlying factors to heal. As this process takes place, at the right time the practitioner can then slowly help wean the patient off medications. If the patient is not in an urgent care situation and is willing to work with nat- ural care, then clinicians would be prudent to avoid medications A main cause of both stress and disordered sleep is amygdala overac- tivation. As the fear center of the brain, the amygdala expresses high levels of CRH receptors in chronically stressed individuals, making it more reactive in times of stress. Stress-induced changes in the amyg- dala are a likely critical step in the pathophysiology of the development of chronic anxiety states. As noted elsewhere in this chapter, chronic stress also encourages maladaptive responses that result in affective Therapeutic counseling is of enormous value to help process stress properly. Although many counseling techniques are useful for affec- tive disorders, the one with the best support in the medical litera- ture is CBT. CBT is shown to be especially effective and enduring for depression and anxiety123 and may be of value for bipolar disorder.124 Oftentimes, in conventional care, patients taking drugs for mood dis- order tend to stay on them for the rest of their lives. That tendency is proven not to be the case with CBT, because the patient is taught new skills with which to deal with depression, and these skills are shown to be at least as enduring in effect as keeping patients on medication.125 CBT works to help a patient recognize his or her negative automatic thoughts and change these to more empowering, positive thoughts and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is a form of cogni- tive therapy combined with mindful meditation. Using MBCT, bipo- lar disorder patients saw improvements in cognitive functioning and emotional regulation, as well as reduction in symptoms of anxiety,

depression, and manic episodes.126 Studies dating back to the early 1900s have shown that meditation training programs can effectively reduce symptoms of anxiety and panic and help maintain these reduc- tions in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or panic disorder with agoraphobia.127

## Yoga and Meditation

Yoga and meditation can both help lower stress hormones and return the body to parasympathetic mode. Numerous studies point to yoga’s ability to modulate HPA axis function to effectively reduce depression, anxiety, and stress.128 Yoga’s ability to lower cortisol, modulate hor- mones, and regulate the activity of both the parasympathetic and sym- pathetic nervous systems may underlie some of the benefits it offers for both anxiety and stress. Physiologically, yoga has been shown to lower cortisol and decrease inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP).

## Massage Therapy

Massage therapy can also balance HPA axis dysregulation while help- ing balance neurotransmitters. A review of 37 randomized, controlled trials on massage found the benefits of massage even rivaled psycho- therapy for depression and state anxiety (a temporary anxious change spurred by an outside situation).129


Healthy eating leads to better mental health. Increasingly, research is showing that wholesome, whole food intake helps prevent mood disorders and can help treat them too. Nutrient intake allows for the fundamental building blocks of neurotransmitters, membranes, and neuronal cells. Our food will help maintain neuroplasticity via influ- ence on trophic factors, by creating inflammation balance, and by maintaining a healthful microbiome. A landmark 5-year study in Spain looked at the lives and eating patterns of 10,000 people. Those people who followed a Mediterranean diet (MD) were 50% less likely to develop anxiety or depression. The study specifically found that intake of fruits, nuts, beans, and olive oil supported mood best.130 Other studies regarding the MD have also shown that the endothelial linings of the subjects were much health- ier, and rates of cardiovascular disease were lower with the MD. Furthermore, additional studies by the same group in Spain found that those people who ate in this healthy way also had higher levels of BDNF. BDNF has been shown to be low in individuals with depres- sion131 and anxiety.132 The components of a Mediterranean Diet are listed in Table 142.1. Mounting research also points to the beneficial effects of a healthy diet on neurotransmitter activity, the inflammasome, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurological pathology in patients with bipolar disorder. Fermented foods contain probiotics, which cultivate many bene- ficial microorganisms and probiotic strains for gut and brain health. Many of these species and strains are not found in supplementation. A whole foods diet is also replete with nondigestible fiber that is prebi- otic, or food for gut microorganisms. The practitioner can tell a patient that even short-term healthy fiber-full changes in diet can improve mood by influencing changes in microorganism species.134 Oftentimes, patients and practitioners alike will ask my opinion on the best diet. Although I think these questions are best answered by understanding each patient case and possible food sensitivities, if I do not know the individual or his or her history, I would recommend the Mediterranean diet. Although no one diet is completely perfect for every individual due to possible allergies and sensitivities, there is rea- son to believe the Mediterranean diet may far surpass the benefits of other choices for people with mood disorders.

## Insufficient Protein Intake

Protein breaks down into amino acids, which are used to make neu- rotransmitters. Inadequate protein intake will contribute to com- promised neurotransmitter production. For example, tryptophan depletion studies have shown evidence of a clear decrease in available brain tryptophan as well as low levels of serotonin.135 Repletion of amino acids to a diet low in protein has been shown in animal studies to correct learning disabilities and cognitive dysfunction.136 Interestingly, low tryptophan intake, relative to other amino acids, may also con- tribute to low brain serotonin when other large neutral amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, threonine, methionine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and histidine) in the diet compete with tryptophan for transport across the blood–brain barrier. This is why therapeutic doses of amino acids are best taken away from other amino acids and protein sources.

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Allergies/Sensitivities

Beyond eating healthy, specific food components can provoke the immune system toward proinflammatory pathways that will promote poor mood (see the section on Inflammation). Depression and fatigue have been linked to food allergies for more than 90 years. In Rowe coined the term “allergic toxemia” to describe a syndrome that included the symptoms of depression, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, drowsiness, difficulty in concentration, and nervousness.137 Although the term is no longer used, today we know both adults and children dealing with food allergy will show impaired quality of life, a higher level of stress and anxiety, and increased incidence of many diseases.138 For example, both celiac disease and gluten sensitivities may present with a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric comorbidities.139 Patients with bipolar disorder show an increase of blood antigliadin deamidated antibodies (IgGs)140 as well as antibodies to bovine milk caseins.141 Although beyond the scope of this chapter, helping patients identify and treat food allergies and sensitivities will be of value when helping gut function and balancing immunological activity in most effectively treating affective disorders.

In a number of studies using various animal models, supplemental probiotics have been shown to reverse the effects of stress. Although more studies are welcome, currently a few human clinical tri- als suggest that supplementation may promote stress resilience or

reduce stress-induced physical symptoms and cognitive deficits in humans. Clinical evaluations of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 supplementation in rats and a double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized human trial suggested lowered anxiety and alleviation of psychological distress in subjects after days.150 In what is probably the first study to look at probiotic sup- plementation effects on sad mood, a Leiden University evaluation studied 20 patients in a triple-blind study for 4 weeks. These patients were given B. bifidum, B. lactis, L. acidophilus, L. brevis, L. casei, L. salivarius, and L. lactis. In comparison with controls, the interven- tion showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts.151 A meta-analysis of probiotic supplements for mood reviewed five randomized, controlled trials, with a total of about 280 patients during a 4- to 8-week duration. This analysis revealed that probiotics significantly decreased depression scale scores in depressed subjects. Interestingly, there was no effect in patients older than years,152 which may suggest there are more formidable digestive con- cerns that need to be addressed among the senior population. Can probiotic supplements help bipolarity? A Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine study looked at 66 patients hospitalized for mania where patients were randomized after discharge to receive 24 weeks of adjunctive probiotics L. rhamnosus strain GG and B. ani- malis. This study found 24 rehospitalizations in the 33 individuals who received placebo and only 8 rehospitalizations in the 33 individuals who received the probiotics. Probiotic treatment also resulted in fewer days actually rehospitalized versus placebo.153 Even more interesting and as a nice segue to the next section, this study showed us that the positive effects of the probiotic treatment on the prevention of rehos- pitalization was greater in individuals with elevated levels of systemic inflammation at baseline. This finding suggests to us that the probi- otics may have a beneficial effect on lowering inflammation, a known factor in mood disorder.

## Amino Acid Therapy

Amino acids are used by the body to synthesize neurotransmitters. Typically taken as supplements, the following amino acids are the most typical ones used to support mood.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan and 5-Hydroxytryptophan

Tryptophan is the precursor to hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), which converts to serotonin, which ultimately makes melatonin. Theoretically, individuals with mood disorders due to low serotonin may benefit by taking supplementation of these serotonin precursors. Despite the widespread use and anecdotal reports, relatively very few studies explored use of tryptophan and 5-HTP for mood disorders. A study of 25 healthy young volunteers showed positive affect scores after subjects consumed a high-tryptophan diet versus a low-tryptophan diet, including fewer depressive symptoms and decreased anxiety.154 Some research suggests more benefit from tryptophan supplementa- tion in patients with low expression of the 5-hydroxytryptamine trans- porter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR).155 5-HTP is the downstream metabolite of tryptophan. Although some published pilot research of small subject groups taking 5-HTP has been completed, clearly more study is needed. For patients with high levels of inflammation, 5-HTP may be a more suitable choice because tryptophan may convert more easily to quinolinic acid via the kynurenine pathway in these patients (see Fig. 142.4). Patients with bipolar disorder tend to shift to the hydroxykynurenine arm of the kynurenine pathway and probably should avoid tryptophan sup- plementation.156 In addition, 5-HTP may also be more able to cross the blood–brain barrier; 5-HTP may be contraindicated in depressed patients with already low catecholamine levels and/or as a long-term monotherapy as 5-HTP is recognized to deplete catecholamines, which can participate in depression.157,158 One meta-analysis looking at all the depression studies evaluating tryptophan and 5-HTP found that few were well done.

studies, only two studies with a total of 64 patients met sufficient qual- ity criteria to be included. However, these studies did suggest 5-HTP and L-tryptophan are better than placebo at alleviating depression.159 Two small studies show tryptophan supplementation to be possi- bly as successful in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder as light therapy. The first study of 16 patients used 3 grams per day for 2 weeks as augmentation after light therapy alone was not sufficient to create a helpful effect. The second 13-patient study used light therapy or tryp- tophan and showed greater benefits when the supplement was used.160 There is promising research using tryptophan and 5-HTP, but given the widespread use already, more high-quality research on a larger number of individuals is very welcome.159

## Phenylalanine and Tyrosine

As tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan are precursors for serotonin, L-phenylalanine and tyrosine are the precursors for neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE).162 Phenylalanine is a precursor of brain phenylethylamine (PEA), an amino acid derivative that promotes overall energy and elevation of mood.163 Phenylalanine also converts to tyrosine, which is in turn converted to dopamine, and subsequently nor- epinephrine and epinephrine, and is known to mildly stimulate the ner- vous system, which may have benefit in depression and attention issues. PEA ← Phenylalanine → tyrosine → dopamine → norepinephrine → epinephrine Studies of both phenylalanine-and tyrosine-depleted patients paint a picture of them as less content and more apathetic.164 However, few clinical studies have examined the effects of supplementing either of these two amino acids for depression. In 1990 a randomized, pro- spective, double-blind comparison of 65 outpatients with major depression were given oral L-tyrosine or imipramine. Although both treatments trended toward some improvement, imipramine showed greater improvement, with little difference between placebo and tyrosine. The only effect noted to achieve statistical significance was greater dry mouth with imipramine.165 Researchers in 1978 adminis- tered DL-phenylalanine in doses from 75 to 200 mg per day for depressed patients for 20 days. In this trial, 12 patients were able to be discharged without any further treatment due to positive response. Another 4 patients had mildly positive response, and two did not respond. L-phenylalinine is known to raise dopamine. The L version acts more as an analgesic, so if the patient is also suffering from fibro- myalgia or other chronic pain, the D-L combination might be most suitable. Neither tyrosine nor phenylamine amino acids are suggested for patients with anxiety or bipolarity. One work suggests increased susceptibility to tardive dyskinesia in neuroleptic-prescribed patients with high blood levels of phenylalanine, so supplementing may be con- traindicated in these patients until more is known (Table 142.2).166

## Acetyl-L-Carnitine

Carnitine is an amino acid that has been shown to help mood, fatigue, and depression in patients with cancer and encephalopathies.167,168 Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is similar in structure to the neurotrans- mitter acetylcholine and acts as an acetylating agent and cholinergic neurotransmitter. ALC has also been shown to have epigenetic effects on receptor production in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to contribute to a rapid antidepressant effect.169 MRI studies in geriat- ric depressed patients found imbalances in the prefrontal cortex were resolved using doses of ALC.170 As the word “carnitine” comes from the Latin word “carne,” which represents meat, it is not surprising that the highest concentrations of this amino acid comes in red meats. Although intraperitoneal administration of carnitine in rats has shown antianxiety benefits, there are no trials showing anxiety benefit in humans.171

## Glycine

The simplest of the amino acids, glycine is a calming amino acid known to reduce neuronal excitement, optimize GABA levels, and bind to the locus coeruleus to decrease the release of norepinephrine. Two double- blind, placebo-controlled studies in 14 and 16 healthy patients exposed to loud sounds found that high doses of glycine (0.8 g/kg of body weight) calmed the brain’s cortex and decreased reaction to the sound by lessening auditory-evoked potentials.172

<!-- chunk -->

## Gamma Amino-Butyric Acid and Phenibut

Gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) is a natural calming brain neu- rotransmitter that may act like a natural benzodiazepine. People who suffer with anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy, and other brain disorders often do not manufacture sufficient levels of GABA. Supplemental GABA creates a hypnotic effect by opening chloride channels to allow cell hyperpolarization, thereby inactivating the nerve cell to slow its firing. Also, evidence suggests decreased brain beta waves.173 Contradicting studies question the ability of this supplement to cross the blood–brain barrier.174 Very little research has been conducted to evaluate benefit for anxiety. A study of 40 patients with insomnia given 300 mg showed improved sleep latency and efficacy with preservation of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep, which is something sedative hypnotic drugs can impair. Mild abdominal discomfort (2 people), headache (1 person), and drowsiness (1 person) were reported.175 Given the ability to calm the brain without drowsiness, GABA may be a good choice for anx- iety but should be avoided in depression without anxious features. Phenibut is a form of GABA known as beta-phenyl-gamma-amino- butyric acid which acts on γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) B and A, as well as D β -phenethylamine receptors, to create both anxiolytic and nootropic effects. Used as a prescription drug in Russia, it is available as a supplement in Western countries. Like its GABA counterpart, this supplement has had little in terms of evidenced-based research. I have seen clear anxiolytic properties as a monotherapy. However, for those committed to use and to prescribing only natural products, Phenibut is of concern. No known toxicity is associated with GABA when used in recom- mended dosages. Phenibut has had limited research. Some case reports suggest that dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms are possible,176 and it is my recommendation to use sparingly, monitor for these concerns, and ensure causes are addressed first.

## Taurine

The amino acid–derivative taurine acts by supporting levels of glycine and GABA to help relax the brain and nervous system while keeping levels of toxic glutamate low. It has been shown to block the effects of excess acetylcholine that contributes to bipolar disorder.177 Taurine is usually dosed about 500 mg up to three times daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## N-Acetyl-Cysteine

N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is a precursor of the master antioxidant glu- tathione, a needed molecule for the increase oxidative stress found in bipolar disorder. NAC has been shown to help reverse glutathione depletion, increase both CNS and peripheral glutathione levels, as well as upregulate production of neuronal stem cells. NAC can also promote mitochondrial integrity and the oxidative phosphorylation needed to produce ATP. A study of 75 patients with bipolar depression in a double-blind study had patients take 1g of NAC twice a day along with standard medications for 20 weeks compared with medication only. The patients taking NAC showed significant improvements based on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Discontinuation of

the supplement at 24 weeks led to “a dramatic return” of symptoms.178 A second trial of 149 gave patients already prescribed mood stabilizers 2 g per day NAC as adjunct maintenance treatment with a substantial decrease in symptoms during the 8-week open-label phase.179

## S-Adenosyl-l-methionine

S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring molecule derived from the amino acid methionine and adenine triphosphate (ATP). Described as early as 1952, it has a decades-long history of use for depression, especially in Europe. Even the American Psychiatric Association has acknowledged it “might be considered” as an alterna- tive to pharmaceutical medications.180 Known best as an antidepres- sant, SAMe serves in many biological reactions by transferring methyl groups to DNA, proteins, fats, and amino acid compounds and sup- porting production of the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.181 Via the function of the methionine pathway, deficiency of B vitamins can contribute to homocysteinemia, with subsequent decreases in SAMe. Hyperhomocysteinemia also leads to increased glutamate, a brain toxin linked to mood disorder. SAMe has been found to be safe and effective in the treatment of mild and moderate depression. According to some accounts, SAMe has a faster onset of action than conventional antidepressants.182 The most recent meta-analysis suggests promising effects, but evidence is still somewhat limited.183,184 Anxiety studies have not been conducted, and a few case studies suggest SAMe may exacerbate or precipitate symp- toms of mania in bipolar disorder.185 Its best use may be especially for depression accompanied by low B-vitamin status and hyperhomocys- teinemia or known genetic defects in the methionine pathway.

## Essential Fatty Acids

The brain neuronal membranes contain a high proportion of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Communities who consume high levels through fish are known to have fewer instances of anxiety and depressive illness. Mechanistically, fish oil helps normalizes the membranes of brain tissues and simultaneously supports and calms the adrenal system during anxious and stressful times.186 Essential fatty acids (EFAs), obtained through both fish oil as well as some vegetable sources in smaller amounts, provide an array of pleiotropic activity, including anti-inflammatory effects, nerve growth factor production, improved glucose metabolism, and calming of the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex (areas that are known to be overactive in people with both depression and anxiety).187,188 There is conflicting evidence regarding the effective use of omega supplements as a monotherapy for depression. This conflicting evidence may be explained by the presence or absence of essential fat deficiency,189 intake levels of competing omega-6 fatty acids, and status of the fatty acid desaturase enzyme. (See Nutrigenomics and Single Genetic Nucleotide Polymorphisms section.) For depression, omega supplementation makes sense (unless the patient is allergic) as a nutritive and neuroen- docrine support and may be a necessary part of addressing underlying factors. Higher dietary levels of essential fatty acids (EFAs) are inversely associated with anxiety.190 A meta-analysis reviewing 19 high-qual- ity clinical trials (both placebo and nonplacebo controlled) spanning 2240 participants from 11 countries found significantly reduced anxiety symptoms with treatment of omega-3 PUFA dosage of 2000 mg or more per day compared with controls.191 In a study of 100 bipolar I patients, either 1000 mg of omega-3 supplement or placebo was given daily for months. Significant improvements were seen in the group with mania.192

## Vitamin D

Deficiency of the “neurosteroid” vitamin D causes mood changes in several ways. Hypothalamic brain centers are responsive to the presence of vitamin D, where low levels will affect the function of the HPA axis.193 Vitamin D affects nerve growth factor,194 which is import- ant for brain and neuronal repair and growth and helps production of serotonin, testosterone, and thyroid hormone.195 A cross-sectional study of anxiety patients also found significantly lower levels of cal- cidiol (a vitamin D precursor) in men and women with depression as well as in age-matched patients with anxiety disorders. To be expected, bipolar patients may benefit from proper levels of vitamin D as well. A Dutch study’s evaluation of 118 patients with bipolar disorder and 202 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder revealed vitamin D deficiency was 4.7 times more common among outpatients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder than among the general population.196 A stringent meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled studies clearly determined statistically significant improvements in depression using vitamin D supplementation greater than 800 IU per day, with an effect size comparable to medications.197 Although trials are ongo- ing on vitamin D for bipolar patients, a recent 8-week open trial of 2000 IU did result in improved mood symptoms. Imaging also showed increases in anterior cingulate cortex GABA levels, which may imply a calming effect, too. Whenever prescribing vitamin D, be sure to consider the status of vitamins A and K 2 .

## B Vitamins and Folate

B vitamins play an important role in neurotransmitter production, mitochondrial function, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) metabolism, prostaglandin formation, and homocysteine regulation, all of which affect mood. An association between B-vitamin deficiencies (espe- cially vitamins B 6 , B 12 , and folate) with higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms has been described in several epidemiologi- cal reports.198 An evaluation of 3500 adults revealed higher intakes of B 6 , B 12 , and folate, whether through foods or supplementation, were associated with a decreased likelihood of incident depression for up to 12 years of follow-up. For each 10 additional milligram of vitamin B 6 and 10 additional micrograms of vitamin B 12 , researchers found a 2% decreased risk of depressive symptoms per year.199 Vitamin B 3 (niacinamide) increases availability of tryptophan as well as production of 5-HTP. Vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine) is a main cofac- tor for enzymes that convert L-tryptophan to serotonin. In females with known evidence of serum vitamin B 6 deficiency due to oral con- traceptive use, supplementation with 40 mg per day of vitamin B 6 improved both anxiety and depression.200 Vitamin B 12 is a key player in the synthesis of serotonin. Besides being an important factor in serotonin synthesis, folic acid is also needed to support dopamine, norepinephrine, and epineph- rine.201 Generally low folate status seems to be more associated with low mood and depression and but not as much with anxiety.202 Folic acid has been well implicated in depressive disorders, and folic acid deficiency has been noted among people with depression; some esti- mates suggest up to 33% of depressed individuals are folate-deficient. Several studies regarding its role in the pathophysiology of depression show that patients with depression often have a functional folate defi- ciency, and the severity of such deficiency correlates with depression severity.203 More about methylfolate is discussed in the Nutrigenomics and Genetic Predispositions section.

patients with depression. A meta-analysis of seven randomized, con- trolled trials suggests modest benefit for depression and especial use- fulness in patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.206 In one double-blind, controlled, randomized crossover study of 20 subjects with panic attacks, researchers had each participant take 18 grams per day followed by 1 month of fluvoxamine. In the first month, inositol reduced the number of panic attacks per week to 4.0, compared with 2.4 fewer attacks with fluvoxamine.207

## Triacetyluridine

Uridine is a precursor molecule for ribonucleic acid (RNA). Triacetyluridine (TAU) is a more bioavailable form of this nutrient. Found in high levels in beer, it can be a support for neuronal synthesis. In vitro work shows TAU can inhibit neurotoxic effects by improving mitochondrial recovery. Clinical studies of 18 g per day for 6 weeks showed decreased depressive symptoms in bipolar patients while increasing brain pH.208 Supplement dosages range from 25 mg up to the study dosage of 18 g per day.

## Minerals

<!-- chunk -->

## Chromium

As increased sugar intake is correlated with depression, the essential trace mineral chromium may be a useful means to balance blood sugar and the brain. Chromium’s mechanism of action seems to be via modification of brain serotonin levels209 as well as by increasing insu- lin insensitivity.210 In a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, place- bo-controlled trial, subjects received 1000 mcg chromium per day, mcg chromium per day, or placebo. Fasting glucose was significantly reduced in both chromium groups compared with the placebo group; similarly, numerically but not significantly, greater reductions in binge frequency, weight, and symptoms of depression were observed in those treated with chromium versus placebo, although statistical power was limited in this pilot trial. Other research suggests chromium’s best mood effect may be in patients with blood sugar regulation (like dia- betes) who have concomitant disturbances in dopamine and serotonin function.211


Magnesium is a mineral cofactor involved in hundreds of biochem- ical reactions. Low magnesium intake occurs in almost 70% of the U.S. population.212 Magnesium deficiency may be a key player in the pathophysiology of affective disorders, as the limbic system and HPA axis function are both sensitive to magnesium status. Lowered magnesium will allow easier damage to nervous tissue, increas- ing inflammation, as evidenced by increased levels of C- reactive protein.

## Iron

Important for myelin-sheath formation, neurotransmitter creation, and energy metabolism, iron is a mineral needed for best mood. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with both depressive mood, anxiety,213 and gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and dyspepsia.214 Decreased dopamine levels will encourage low iron status, although norepinephrine and glutamate levels tend to increase available iron. Interestingly, levels of GABA are elevated in iron deficiencies, as an overall reduction in neurotransmission rates and brain activity occurs due to insufficient energy.215 Excess iron can also be problematic: neuronal damage can be caused by iron overload. Iron levels even in high normal ranges can increase depressive symptoms in young male adults, but not in females,216 and hemochromatosis has been implicated in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.217 Finally, in this world of heavy contamination of the environment with neurotoxins, the importance of iron for the heme backbone of the cytochromes for their detoxification is critical.


Zinc is a mineral that supports hippocampal BDNF production218 and is a pleiotropic cofactor in multiple reactions involved in energy metabolism and digestive health. Zinc is predominately found in glutamatergic neurons, typically acting as an inhibitory factor at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor.219 Low zinc sta- tus may cause lower levels of GABA, increasing anxiety symptoms. Zinc levels are decreased by inflammation and stress.220 Meta-analyses demonstrate clear inverse association between depression severity and serum zinc levels.221 Zinc supplementation alleviates anger and depression.222 Patients with anxiety also reveal sig- nificantly higher plasma levels of copper and copper-to-zinc ratios as well as lowered absolute zinc levels compared with controls. In treated patients, zinc picolinate daily for 8 weeks restored that balance and improves symptoms.223 Optimal zinc dosage is 15 to 30 mg per day. It should be taken with food due to the possibility of gastric upset. Top foods sources of zinc include beef, lamb, and turkey.

## Lithium

Lithium is a mood-stabilizing mineral with antidepressant, antimanic, and oxytocin-supporting properties. Geographical areas with higher natural lithium concentrations in the drinking water are associated with lower mortality rates from suicide.224 Most well known in the car- bonate form, which is prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder, although now newer drugs are available. The typical supplement form of lithium is lithium orotate, which is a salt of lithium and orotic acid. Lithium orotate may be the preferred form, because the orotate ion is known to traverse the blood–brain barrier more easily than the drug version, which uses the carbonate ion of lithium. As a result, the orotate form can be used in much lower doses with reasonable results and no side effects.225 Lithium orotate has not been extensively studied. In one evaluation, alcoholic patients were prescribed 150 mg of lithium orotate (approximately 5 to 7 mg of elemental lithium a day) 4 to 5 times a week. Out of 42 patients, of the patients had no alcoholic relapse for more than 3 and up to years, and 13 patients remained without relapse for 1 to 3 years. The remaining 12 had relapses between 6 to 12 months.226 Lithium orotate is commonly dosed at 5 to 20 mg per day of ele- mental lithium with no toxicity. Its best use seems to be for anxiety and bipolar disorder with a strong manic component. At this time, it is not recommended for depression that does not have a strong anxiety component. There is a case study of lithium orotate overdose in an 18-year-old, with an estimated intake of more than 2000 mg of ele- mental lithium. This patient had normal vital signs but complained of nausea and vomiting, and she presented with a tremor, which resolved after 90 minutes of IV fluids.227

## Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort)

St. John’s wort (SJW) is one of the most studied herbs of all time. The Latin name Hypericum perforatum means “above a ghost,” and this botanical was originally gathered as a way to ward off evil spirits. Although often thought of as a “natural SSRI,” SJW has pleiotropic effects all around the body and brain via multiple mechanisms. The overall benefits of this herb cannot be attributed to a single constituent. SJW may affect neurotransmitters, acting as a mild monoamine oxidase inhibitor and having serotonin enhancement properties,228,229 although some literature suggests this effect is too weak to have

<!-- chunk -->

## 1077CHAPTER 142 Affective Disorders

therapeutic effect for depression.230 Hypericum also inhibits acetyl- choline breakdown,231 balances norepinephrine and dopamine, and supports GABA production. Besides neurotransmitter actions, it has pleiotropic effects that may also encourages mitochondrial function and oligodendrocyte development.232 It may have anti-inflammatory effects and nerve protective properties.233 As of this writing, the latest meta-analysis of SJW reviewed 27 clin- ical trials with a total of 3808 patients, which compared the use of St. John’s wort with use of SSRI medications. Study durations varied from 4 to 12 weeks and showed St. John’s wort has comparable efficacy and safety in comparison with SSRIs as well as a significantly lower patient discontinuation of the herb versus the drugs.234 Case reports link St. John’s wort to mania, suggesting it may not be a good choice for bipolar disorder treatment.235 Because hyperfo- rin, one of the chief components of SJW, plays an important role in the induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein trans- porter,236 it can affect pharmacokinetics of various drugs and should be used cautiously with pharmaceuticals.

## Curcumin

Inflammation is an underlying cause of mood disorder. Baseline levels of high-sensitivity CRP, TNF- α , and IL-6237 are elevated in patients with major depression.238 Curcumin, a plant polyphenol with anti-in- flammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, is consid- ered the main active component of the spice turmeric. Meta-analysis of six clinical trials showed significant clinical effi- cacy of curcumin in ameliorating depressive symptoms as well as sig- nificant antianxiety effects.239 Putatively, curcumin may be of benefit for bipolarity due to its influence on known mechanisms of the disor- der, including influence on proinflammatory cytokines, growth fac- tors, inflammatory mediators, and antiapoptotic proteins.240

## Cannabidiol Oil

Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is typically extracted from the hemp plant and is not psychoactive like the tetra hydro cannabinoid (THC) found in marijuana. With known anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, and neuroprotective effects, this flavonoid does not directly bind with cannabinoid receptors, but it does inhibit degradation of the natural endocannabinoid anandamide.241 It also affects the adenosine receptor function that controls wakefulness and the vanilloid receptors to reg- ulate inflammation, and it may bind to serotonin receptors as well.242 CBD’s best use might be for anxiety. CBD was first studied in patients taking marijuana, where it was shown to blunt the anxiety effects of THC.243 In human trials, CBD has significantly reduced the social anxiety associated with a simulated public speaking tests in healthy subjects where it helped balance amygdala (fear center) and hippocampus (memory and emotion) areas of the limbic system. This effect was comparable to the anxiety medications ipsapirone and diazepam (Valium).244 Given its mechanisms, it may be beneficial in bipolar disorder. As of this writing, a Brazilian clinical trial is recruit- ing to study CBD in bipolar patients.245 More research is needed, but the available research is compelling, and I have seen very good clinical results with CBD.

## Passiflora (Passionflower)

Passionflower has a long and rich folklore history of use as a calmative agent because it has anxiolytic properties and is considered an official plant medicine in many countries worldwide. Passionflower works for reducing anxiety in part by binding itself to benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. It has chrysin and other flavonoid-like compounds with confirmed antianxiety, anti-inflammatory activities.246 A 2007 Cochrane review looked at two studies with a total of 198 participants, which found lack of difference in the efficacy between benzodiazepines and passi- flora, improved job performance, and lower rate of drowsiness versus the drugs. Although the author concluded that there are too few stud- ies to conclude efficacy for passiflora, it seems reasonable to try it given the long history of use for anxiety and minimal side effects.247 I do not find passiflora to be as powerful an anxiolytic as a benzodiazepine might be, but with a full integrative natural medicine plan, it can help create a calming effect to avoid the need for more addictive pharmaceuticals.

## Rhodiola rosea

Rhodiola was originally described in the Russian literature as a plant medicine useful to combat physical, biological, and chemical stress- ors. As an adaptogenic herb, studies show it acts as a neuroprotective, cardioprotective, antifatigue, antidepressive, anxiolytic, nootropic (cognitive enhancing) agent, with life-span–increasing effects and CNS-stimulating activity.248 Rhodiola is typically standardized for 1% of the molecule rosavin. Longer-term studies of this adaptogen are needed, but what we know so far is that rhodiola is a great choice for patients who are depressed and/or anxious and feeling burnt out. In an early study pitting an herb directly against an antidepressant, researchers compared 340 mg of a powdered extract of R. rosea stan- dardized to a content of 3.7% rosavin, with sertraline HCl (Zoloft) or placebo for 12 weeks. Twenty patients were randomized to the R. rosea group, 19 to the sertraline group, and 18 to the placebo group. Interestingly, all treatments had similar findings: nonstatistical reduc- tions in symptom assessments, with more patients suffering adverse reactions with sertraline (63.2%) in comparison with R. rosea (30.0%) or placebo (16.7%).249 These results suggest sertraline had a slightly greater effect versus R. rosea, although the botanical medicine had significantly fewer side effects. Strikingly noted is that the benefits of neither the drug nor the herb differed much in comparison with pla- cebo. Remember that meta-analysis has shown that in cases of mild to moderate depression, pharmaceuticals generally do not work any bet- ter than placebo,250 which boasts a 25% to 30% effectiveness rate. This study is consistent with a greater body of research that shows minimal but measurable effects for botanicals in mild and moderate depression, and suggests that given the similar efficacy, ability to heal underlying causes, and lower side effects, these botanicals make a better choice.

## Saffron

With serotonergic, anti-inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and neuro- protective properties, the traditional Persian medicine pharmacopeia has long understood the vibrant color and power of saffron. This spice is one of the world’s most expensive and healthful. There are a number of clinical trials related to saffron for depression. In 2014 an Australian meta-analysis found large treatment effects, with similar effective rates compared with patient antidepressants.251 With a number of studies looking at saffron for depression, a meta-analysis reviewed 11 clinical studies for qualitative analysis, with studies pooled for statistical analysis, and identified that saffron has a sig- nificant effect on the severity of depression.252 Consistent with past analy- sis, it seems this herb has at least the same benefits as antidepressant drugs. What interests many patients is that saffron has also been studied for helping alleviate the sexual side effects of antidepressant medica- tions. Studies have separately looked at the effect on 36 men and women. For the men, greater improvement was apparent in erectile dysfunction and intercourse satisfaction in 9 patients (60%) with saf- fron versus one patient (7%) in the placebo group who achieved nor- mal erectile function.253 The women enjoyed significant improvement in arousal, lubrication, and dyspareunia, although desire, satisfaction, and orgasm were not changed.254 A separate meta-analysis has con- firmed saffron’s benefit on erectile dysfunction.255

## Homeopathic Medicines

Studies evaluating homeopathic medicines for psychiatric illness are relatively scant but increasing. One systematic review of studies between 1982 and 2016 found two double-blind placebo-controlled trials looking at using homeopathics in depression. One study was of 91 patients, and another evaluated 133 subjects. Both suggested effects comparable to those of antidepressant medications.256 A review look- ing at general practitioner offices found patients with affective disor- ders who chose to work with doctors prescribing homeopathy reported less use of psychotropic drugs, and they were marginally more likely to experience clinical improvement than patients managed with conven- tional care.257 A larger review by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry used very stringent criteria and accepted only 25 studies out of more than 1400 reviewed. Efficacy of homeopathic medicines was certified for fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, but benefit was not seen for anxiety or stress. The authors concluded that “Studies in psychiatry are very limited, but results do not preclude the possibility of some benefit.”258 Please see Chapter 39 for more on homeopathy.

## Nutrigenomics and Genetic Single Nucleotide

<!-- chunk -->

## Polymorphisms

Although the field of nutrigenomics is still in its infancy, it is progress- ing rapidly. It may be premature to make dogmatic recommendations regarding the presence of a particular genetic single nucleotide poly- morphism (SNP). However, a few SNPs and gene associations are per- tinent to affective disorders, and if it is possible to obtain this genetic information, these should be kept in mind and correlated with lab- oratory testing and clinical symptomology to create an overall holis- tic plan for the patient with mood disorder. Although this short list of some genetic polymorphisms with reasonable literature to suggest actionable items provides initial information about their properties, much more information is needed to fully use our patient’s genetic information.

<!-- chunk -->

## BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) rs6265

The Met-positive polymorphism may confer less ability to manufac- ture BDNF. Exercise, zinc, and lithium259 supplementation may be of use to naturally support BDNF production.

<!-- chunk -->

## COMT (Catechol O-Methyltransferase) rs769224, rs4680, and

<!-- chunk -->

## rs4633

SNPs of this gene can alter catecholamine degradation and may be key in function of the prefrontal cortex’s input in personality, behav- ior, and emotion. Estrogen metabolism may also be altered as well. Knowing this predisposition, correlating with clinical symptoms may help clinicians choose recommendations designed to boost or lower neurotransmitters and modulate estrogens.

<!-- chunk -->

## CYP2R1 rs10741657 and rs7041

This gene allows for production of the precursor to 25-hydroxy vita- min D 3 , which in turn is converted to the more active 1,25(OH) 2 vita- min D. Certain alleles may result in lower active vitamin D levels. Extra vitamin D may be of value for these patients as correlated with labo- ratory testing.

<!-- chunk -->

## DBH (Dopamine Betahyrdoxylase) rs1108580

DBH manufactures the enzyme that breaks down dopamine. Research on personality traits has found that DBH overactivity is associ- ated with impulsiveness traits, and low activity is associated with sensation-seeking.

<!-- chunk -->

## DRD2 (Dopamine Receptor D2) rs1800497

This gene is responsible for structural components of the dopa- mine receptor. Gene polymorphisms may be associated with greatly increased risk of addiction and may suggest a poorer result with pre- scribed SSRIs.

<!-- chunk -->

## FADS and FADS1 (Fatty Acid Delta-5-Desaturase) rs174537,

<!-- chunk -->

## rs174546, and rs174547

These code for a desaturase enzyme necessary for conversion of plant fats to essential fatty acids in the body. Essential fatty acids may be of special benefit for patients with this genetic SNP who have concomitant affective disorders and low levels of essential fatty acids.

<!-- chunk -->

## GAD1 (Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 1) rs2241165

This gene encodes for enzymes needed to convert L-glutamic acid into the calming neurotransmitter GABA. SNPs will contribute to higher levels of anxiety and extremely tight muscles and may contribute to the rare condition known as Stiff Person Syndrome. Patients with this genetic SNP may benefit from more exercise, which can upregulate GAD gene function to enhance GABA produc- tion.260 Extra supplemental vitamin B 6 , a cofactor for the glutamic acid decarboxylase enzyme, can help enhance GABA production. Giving supplemental GABA, along with GABA-supportive nutrients such as theanine,261 lithium orotate, and/or calming botanicals like passiflora, may be of value in patients with anxiety who have this polymorphism.

<!-- chunk -->

## GC (Vitamin D Binding Protein) rs2282679

This gene is responsible for structure of a transporter for vitamin D. Hetero- or homozygous positive genotypes will be at higher risk for lower vitamin D levels, which will predispose for affective disorders. Higher intakes of vitamin D may be required.

<!-- chunk -->

## IL-6 (Interleukin-6) rs1800795

Meta-analyses indicated that IL-6 is the most consistently elevated cytokine in the blood of patients with major depression.262 SNP alter- ations in this gene may predispose to higher levels of inflammation in the CNS and periphery. Recommendations to reduce inflammation may be of use.

<!-- chunk -->

## MAOA and B (Monoamine Oxidase A and B) Multiple rs

<!-- chunk -->

## Numbers

This gene encodes mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the oxidative deamination of amines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Knowing this predisposition may help the practitioner cor- relate clinical symptoms to choose recommendations to boost or lower monoamines.

<!-- chunk -->

## MTHFR (Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase) rs1801133

<!-- chunk -->

## and rs1801131

Polymorphisms predispose to reduced folate conversion to active forms. Patients with this SNP and high homocysteine suggest poor methylation abilities, which will affect neurotransmitter creation. Rs1801131 specifically affects neurotransmitter production by poor cycling of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) pathway. Concomitant COMT alleles may predispose to further neurotransmitter imbalances. Consider increasing intake of folate-containing foods (green leafy veg- etables) and supplementation with methyl-folate, and avoiding syn- thetic folic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

## MTR (Methionine Synthase) rs1805087 and MTRR (MTR

<!-- chunk -->

## Reductase) rs1801394

Presence of SNPs in either or both of these might increase require- ments for B 12 , as these support B 12 recycling. Checking serum B 12 and methylmalonic acid might be valuable to confirm clinical significance.

<!-- chunk -->

## OXTR (Oxytocin Receptor) rs53576

Oxytocin was discussed earlier in this chapter. This gene is response for building the oxytocin receptor. The A allele typically predisposes indi- viduals toward poorer stress-management skills, such as the inability to seek help, and these individuals tend to be lonelier.263 Possibly using natural remedies known to raise oxytocin, such as hugging therapy, massage,264 or supplemental lithium,265 would be of value.

<!-- chunk -->

## SLC39A13 (Solute Carrier Family 39 Member 13)

This gene encodes zinc transporter proteins and may be related to mood disorders.266 Polymorphisms may suggest additional zinc would be beneficial for the person with affective disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

## TPH 1 and 2 (Tryptophan Hydroxylase 1 and 2) rs1799913,

<!-- chunk -->

## rs4570625, and rs429027

This gene helps govern the conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP, and the T allele may affect available serotonin and mood state as a result. Variants affect the circadian-regulating function of suprachiasmatic nuclei, which is a master controller of circadian rhythm.267 Light ther- apy, tryptophan, 5-HTP, melatonin, and its cofactor (such as vitamin B 6 ) might be useful with this genetic SNP.

# PRIMARY PREVENTION: THE PRENATAL

# ENVIRONMENT AND CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE

Although beyond the scope of this chapter, clinicians need to be aware of the critical effect of the prenatal environment and childhood experi- ences as dominant factors in the overall tone of the HPA axis. Prenatal and childhood stress will greatly affect CRH and cortisol levels as adults.268,269 From a holistic standpoint, it should also be noted that besides emotional stressors, dietary imbalances such as poor nourish- ment and low birth weight, maternal overeating, and prenatal high- fat diets will also contribute to HPA and mood disorder in the next generation. Along with proper nutrition, mind–body modalities in the prenatal and childhood period may hold the greatest promise in pre- venting affective disorders. Multimodal psychoeducation approaches, yoga, and meditation interventions have shown outcomes like higher birth weight, shorter labor, fewer instrument-assisted births, and reduced perceived stress and anxiety.270

# PERTINENT LABORATORY TESTING

It will nearly impossible, due to cost and practicality, to order all possi- ble testing. It is important to have an excellent intake with the patient to gather clinical evidence to support the need for looking down vari- ous paths with specific tests.

<!-- chunk -->

## Blood Tests

Blood work can be used to assess multiple factors, including those related to red blood cell, nutrient, inflammation, hormonal and mito- chondrial status. • Blood Sugar: fasting glucose / Serum Insulin / HgbA1C • Complete Blood Count • Chemistry Panel • Iron Panel: ferritin and serum iron • Lipid Panel • Homocysteine • Histamine • TSH, T3, T4 • DHEA/DHEA sulfate • Pregnenolone • Estrogens (E1, E2, E3) • Progesterone (preferably day 22 of a premenopausal woman’s menstrual cycle) • Free and total testosterone, estrogen, and testosterone • 25(OH) Vitamin D • Zinc and Copper • Vitamin B 12 and folic acid • Serum methylmalonic acid • Serum glutathione • Serum carnitine • Serum lactic acid • Serum CoQ10 • Celiac Panel • Serum heavy metals: mercury, cadmium, arsenic, lead, aluminum

## Leaky Gut Tests

Lactulose Mannitol Testing can help identify “gut permeability,” which can play a role in altered gut microbiota brain and CNS inflam- mation.271 Review Chapter 19, Intestinal Permeability. Small Intestinal Bowel Overgrowth (SIBO) Test: May help cre- ate an effective treatment plan for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is highly correlated with anxiety and depression symptoms. See Chapter 9, Bacterial Overgrowth of the Small Intestine Breath Test, for more discussion. Hair Analysis: Can help discern mineral status as well as heavy metal status. See Chapter 16, Hair Mineral Analysis, for discussion. Urine Toxic Metal Testing: Both unprovoked and provoked tests are used to evaluate heavy metal status in a patient and need for detoxification techniques, covered in other chapters of this book. Please see Chapter 22, Metal Toxicity: Assessment of Exposure and Retention.


General therapeutic approaches for affective disorders, whether depression, anxiety or bipolarity are as follows.

protein for neurotransmitter support, as well intake and small fre- quent meals, may be ideal to avoid fluctuations in blood sugar. Unsaturated fats (fish, olive oil) are encouraged for optimal fatty acid intake. For a healthy microbiome, incorporate fermented foods to help balance microbiota and fiber foods for prebiotic support.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sleep

Assure 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep, preferably getting to bed by p.m. Keep the bedroom dark and at an average of 68°F (20°C) or less.


Assure a balanced exercise regimen. Five days a week of moderate to vigorous exercise for 30 minutes may be a starting point. For those less vital or motivated, a gentler program might be indicated. See Chapter 36 on The Exercise Prescription.

## Lifestyle

Avoid all alcohol and avoid excess caffeine (avoid all caffeine if insom- nia is present). Minimize screens and social media.

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychological Work

Regular cognitive behavioral therapy to work on negative thoughts.

<!-- chunk -->

## Relaxation Work

• Spending time in nature • Working with yoga • Participating in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)

## Supplementation

Choose supplements most salient to a patient’s circumstance and lab- oratory values. • Hormone support: supplements, botanicals for supporting the physiology, or actual hormone: thyroid, estrogen, progesterone, melatonin, cortisol, testosterone DHEA • Probiotics: Lactobacillus and bifidus spp. • Essential fatty acids: 1000 to 2000 mg fish oil per day • Vitamin D: 1000 IU to 5000 IU. Check labs to assure proper dosing. Assess and address status of vitamins A and K 2 . • Vitamin B 6 (pyridoxine ′ phosphate form): 25 to 50 mg a day • Vitamin B 12 (methyl or Adenosylcobalamin form): 1000 up to 10,000 mcg a day • Methyl folate: 500 mcg up to 5 mg a day • Magnesium: 125 mg to 500 mg a day • Iron: 25 mg to 150 mg a day in divided doses, as indicated by labo- ratory testing • Zinc: 15 to 30 mg a day • St. John’s wort: 300 mg three times a day. Be mindful of interac- tions with conventional medications. • Curcumin: 500 to 1000 mg/day • Rhodiola: 340 mg up to 1340 mg a day • Homeopathic medicines: per patient’s individual presentation and constitution

# SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS

# ACCORDING TO AFFECTIVE DISORDER

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression


Depressed patients without insomnia or anxiety may want to try one to two cups of coffee in the morning and early afternoon.


• 5-HTP: 50 mg to 100 mg three times a day. May be best avoided in the long term as a monotherapy in patients with depression who are predisposed to be low in catecholamines are not taking cate- cholamine supports. • Phenylalanine • D phenylalanine: for depressed mood, 350 mg per day • DL phenylalanine: for depression along with a pain picture: 100 to 500 mg per day • Note: Those with phenylketonuria should not supplement with phenylalanine. • Tyrosine: 500 to 1000 mg doses two or three times a day • Acetyl L-carnitine: 1 to 3 grams a day • Inositol: 12 to 18 grams a day • Glycine: best avoided in depression • SAMe: 200 mg twice a day up to 400 mg three times a day; ramp up slowly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiety


May be best to avoid all caffeine, except for small percentage of patients with low dopamine status


• Glycine: for anxiety only, one to three teaspoons a day. Studies sug- gest up to 3 tablespoons can be beneficial without side effects. • GABA: 500 mg three times a day • Phenibut: 300 mg three times day, do not use more than 2 weeks at a time, with a week in between to avoid reliance. Be aware this is not a natural product, and at the time of this writing the FDA has sent warning letters to manufacturers. • Lithium orotate: 5 to 20 mg a day • CBD oil: 15 mg twice a day • Passiflora: ⅓ tsp of extract in a little warm water three times a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Bipolar Disorder


• Gluten-free and casein-free diet

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements to Use

• Taurine: 500 mg three times a day • NAC: 1000 mg twice a day • Triacetyluridine: 25 mg to 18 grams a day, for mitochondrial sup- port and low symptoms

## Light Therapy

10,000-lux full-spectrum white light for at least 30 minutes every morning. This is best initiated in the early fall and discontinued in early spring months.

# A NOTE ABOUT INTEGRATIVE USE OF NATURAL

# MEDICINES AND CONVENTIONAL DRUGS

There are emerging studies looking at the adjunctive use of natural supplementation with pharmaceuticals. A recent Cochrane review sug- gests many supplements are effective and safe when used in combina- tion with drugs for mood.273 It is highly probable that the underlying mechanisms of affective disorders are, in part, due to physiological imbalances and nutrient deficiencies. For example, we know that low serum folic acid and zinc increase the likelihood that antidepressants will not work. Using var- ious supplements with medications, in many cases, may help treat- ments work best. Table 142.2 provides a selected list of studies using natural medicines along with medications: Curcumin administration was safe and well tolerated even when combined with antidepressants. Curcumin was more efficacious than placebo in improving MADRS scores, with significant differences between curcumin and placebo emerging at weeks 12 and 16.

with risk reveal that antibody-mediated mechanisms may play a role in disease pathogenesis.4 The genetic basis of alcohol dependence has also been supported by the following: • Genealogical studies showing that alcohol dependence is a family condition • Studies of adopted children of alcoholic parents raised by foster parents demonstrating a continued higher risk of alcohol depen- dence • Twin studies showing differences between identical and nonidenti- cal twins • Association with genetic markers: color vision, nonsecretor ABH, HLA-B 13 , and low platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) • Biochemical studies showing the importance of alcohol dehydroge- nase polymorphism in racial susceptibility to alcohol dependence.5 Several studies have shown that the incidence of alcohol depen- dence is four to five times more common in the biological children of alcoholic parents than in biological children of nonalcoholic parents.5 Although it would be ultimately useful, knowledge of family history suggests that clear evidence of a biological marker may not be neces- sary for the implementation of a relatively innocuous primary preven- tion program.

## Alcohol Toxicity and Glutathione

The diverse toxic effects of alcohol result not only from the varia- tion in the levels of breakdown products but also from the deple- tion of glutathione. This depletion results in the upregulation of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) to provide more glutathione, likely for Phase II conjugation, as well as to neutralize oxidative stress. Cellular GGT metabolizes extracellular GSH, allowing the precursor cysteine to be reused for de novo synthesis of intracel- lular GSH. There are some major limitations in the use of GGT as a measure of excessive alcohol consumption: 1. GGT also elevates by exposure to other chemicals, especially persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and several prescription drugs. 2. Genetics and nutrient availability will affect GGT’s sensitivity to alcohol consumption. 3. Some chronic imbibers (upward of 9 drinks per day) have GGT in the “normal” range. Individuals have great variation in their ability to produce glu- tathione in response to toxic and oxidative challenge. Nonetheless, GGT is most beneficial when baseline levels are determined on an individual basis. In a uniform population, GGT will increase in direct proportion to alcohol consumption. In a nonuniform popula- tion, 40 g of ethanol per day will elevate GGT ∼ 15%, whereas 60 g per day for 5 weeks in young men will almost double GGT from 27 to u/L. However, there is much individual variation. In general, GGT goes back to “normal” after abstinence for 1 month. Early research shows promise in using glutathione transferase (GSTA1) as a mea- sure for advising patients on their alcohol consumption, as GSTA1 has been shown to be a sensitive and reliable marker in ethanol- induced hepatic injury.6

# INTOXICATION AND WITHDRAWAL

The signs of alcoholic intoxication are typical of a central nervous system depressant: drowsiness, errors of commission, disinhibition, dysarthria, ataxia, and nystagmus. Fifteen milliliters of pure alcohol (the equivalent of 1 oz of whiskey, 4 oz of wine, or 10 oz of beer) raise the blood level of alcohol by 25 mg/dL in a 70-kg person. Table 143.2 shows the effects of varying blood levels of alcohol. Withdrawal symptoms usually occur 1 to 3 days after the last drink. Animal models, as well as findings obtained in humans, have shed light on the effects that acute and chronic alcohol exposure have on signaling systems involving the neurotransmitters glutamate, gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin, as well as on other signaling molecules, including endogenous opioids and corti- cotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) (Fig. 143.2).7 Adaptation to chronic

As a result, glutamate induces excessive activity of the postsynaptic neuron. (From Clapp P, Bhave SV, Hoffman PL.

alcohol exposure by these systems has been associated with several effects ranging from anxiety and tremulousness to mental confusion, tremor, sensory hyperactivity, visual hallucinations, autonomic hyper- activity, diaphoresis, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, seizures, and cardiovascular abnormalities.

# METABOLIC EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL

# DEPENDENCE

<!-- chunk -->

## Ethanol Metabolism

The primary metabolic processes that regulate the rate of alcohol catabolism in normal individuals are8: • The rate of ethanol absorption • The concentration and activity of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) • The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)/nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ ratio in the liver mitochon- dria. It is generally accepted that the availability and regeneration of NAD+ are the dominant rate-limiting factors for ethanol oxidation.9 Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by ADH, with NAD+ as a neces- sary cofactor. The aldehyde product of ethanol metabolism is believed to be responsible both for many of the harmful effects of alcohol consump- tion and for the addictive process itself. Acetaldehyde has been shown to promote cancer by interfering with the replication of DNA and by inhibiting the body’s ability to repair damaged DNA.10 Alcohol use increases the risk of developing a variety of cancers, including colon, liver, breast, throat, mouth, and upper respiratory tract can- cers. Higher-than-normal blood aldehyde levels have been found in alcoholics and their relatives after alcohol consumption.9 This finding suggests either increased ADH activity or depressed ALDH activity in people susceptible to alcohol dependence. Acetaldehyde is converted by ALDH to acetate, with little entering the Krebs cycle; most is con- verted to long-chain fatty acids.8

<!-- chunk -->

## Fatty Liver

All active alcoholics display fatty infiltration of the liver, with the sever- ity roughly proportional to the duration and degree of alcohol excess. Even moderate doses of ethanol may produce both acute and chronic fatty liver infiltrates. The pathogenesis is due to the following8,11: • Increased endogenous fatty acid synthesis • Diminished triglyceride utilization • Impaired lipoprotein excretion • Direct damage to endoplasmic reticulum by free radicals produced by ethanol metabolism • The high-fat diet of the alcoholic (as is typical of the average Amer- ican diet). Leptin is a peptide hormone involved in the regulation of appe- tite and energy metabolism. It is most likely directly related to liver pathology in alcoholics. High levels of leptin are known to contribute to liver pathology, including increased rates of fibrosis, a known factor in liver steatosis.12 Research has demonstrated increased circulating leptin levels in a dose-dependent manner in chronic alcohol depen- dence regardless of nutritional status.13

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoglycemia

Alcohol induces reactive hypoglycemia. The resultant drop in blood sugar produces a craving for food, particularly foods that quickly ele- vate blood sugar (e.g., sugar and alcohol). Increased sugar consump- tion aggravates the reactive hypoglycemia, particularly in the presence of alcohol, owing to alcohol-induced impairment of gluconeogenesis.8 Hypoglycemia aggravates the mental and emotional problems of the alcoholic and the withdrawing alcoholic with symptoms such as: • Sweating • Tremor • Tachycardia • Anxiety • Hunger • Dizziness • Headache • Visual disturbance • Decreased mental acuity • Confusion • Depression


<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrition

Although many of the nutritional problems of alcoholics relate directly to the effects of alcohol, a major contributing factor is that alcoholics tend not to eat, substituting alcohol for food. As a result, the alcoholic has to deal not only with nutritional deficiencies caused by excessive alcohol consumption but also with true nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate intake.


One of the key nutrients involved in the metabolic handling of alcohol is zinc, because both ADH and ALDH are zinc-dependent enzymes, with the latter being more sensitive to deficiency.14 Both acute and chronic alcohol consumption result in zinc deficiency.14,15 Several fac- tors contribute to the development of zinc deficiency in alcoholics: • Decreased dietary intake • Decreased ileal absorption (probably due to interference with the zinc-binding ligand, picolinic acid, and nonspecific mucosal damage) • Hyperzincuria On hair analysis, higher zinc and copper values have been observed in male alcoholics versus nonalcoholics.16 Hair copper was signifi- cantly related to the amount of ethanol consumed, whereas hair zinc was higher in consumers of distilled beverages. These data may indi- cate abnormal metabolism and loss of these minerals in the alcoholic. The clinical symptoms of hypozincemia and copper deficiency in indi- viduals addicted to alcohol often relate to disorders in central nervous system functioning, and they result in decreases in physical and men- tal quality of life. Low serum zinc levels are associated with impaired alcohol metabolism, a predisposition to cirrhosis, impaired testicular function, and other complications of alcohol abuse.14,17 Zinc supple- mentation, particularly when combined with ascorbic acid, greatly increases alcohol detoxification and survival in rats.18

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin A

Vitamin A deficiency is also common in alcoholics and appears to work synergistically with zinc deficiency to produce the major complications of alcohol dependence.11,17 The mechanism has been hypothesized as reduced intestinal absorption of zinc and vitamin A in conjunction with impaired liver function (reduced extraction of zinc, mobilization of retinol binding protein [RBP], and storage of vitamin A), resulting in reduced blood levels of zinc, vitamin A, RBP, and transport proteins as well as a shift to nonprotein ligands. These cause the tissues to have reduced concentrations of zinc and vitamin A, abnormal enzyme activ- ities and glycoprotein synthesis, and impaired DNA/RNA metabolism and cause the kidneys to increasingly lose zinc. These metabolic abnor- malities then lead to the common disorders of alcohol dependence17: • Night blindness • Skin disorders

<!-- chunk -->

## 1086SECTION 6 Diseases

• Cirrhosis of the liver • Reduced skin healing • Decreased testicular function • Impaired immune function Vitamin A supplementation inhibits alcohol consumption in female rats, an effect inhibited by testosterone administration.19 Further research supports the significance of the endocrine system in alcohol preference. Ovariectomized and adrenalectomized rats show a decreased preference for alcohol, whereas corticosterone injections increase alcohol preference.20 Vitamin A supplementation in the alcoholic has corrected vitamin A deficiency, as noted by improvements in night blindness and sexual function.11 Despite the importance and benefits of vitamin A to the alcoholic, great care must be employed in recommending vitamin A supplementation. Excessive amounts of vitamin A are contraindicated owing to the fact that a liver damaged by excessive alcohol consump- tion significantly loses its ability to store vitamin A. As a result, the alcoholic is at great risk for developing vitamin A toxicity when it is supplemented at dosages above 5000 IU a day.


Ethanol consumption increases lipid peroxidation in humans, resulting in increased lipoperoxide levels in both the liver and serum. This increase is aggravated, considering that alcoholics are typically deficient in key antioxidant nutrients, particularly vitamin E, sele- nium, and vitamin C.21,22 There is a significant correlation between serum lipid peroxide levels, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transami- nase (SGOT) activity, and liver cell necrosis.23 Antioxidant admin- istration, either before or together with ethanol intake, inhibits lipoperoxide formation and prevents fatty infiltration of the liver.24 Effective antioxidants include vitamins C and E, zinc, selenium, and cysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Carnitine

Although the use of lipotropic agents appears warranted in treating alcoholic fatty liver disease, many commonly used lipotropic agents (e.g., choline, niacin, cysteine) appear to have little value.25,26 One lipo- tropic agent, carnitine, significantly inhibits alcohol-induced fatty liver disease. It has been suggested that chronic ethanol consumption results in a functional deficiency in carnitine.27-29 Because carnitine normally facilitates fatty acid transportation and oxidation in the mitochondria, a high liver carnitine level may be necessary to handle the increased fatty acid load produced by alcohol consumption. Supplemental car- nitine reduces serum triglycerides and levels of SGOT while also elevat- ing high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol.27

<!-- chunk -->

## Amino Acids

Amino acid chromatography patterns are aberrant in alcoholics; restoration to normal levels greatly aids the alcoholic patient.30-33 Because the liver is the primary site of amino acid metabolism, it is not surprising that alcoholics develop abnormal amino acid patterns. Normalization of plasma amino acids is particularly indicated in those patients showing signs or symptoms of hepatic cirrhosis or depression. The branched-chain amino acids—valine, isoleucine, and leucine— inhibit the hepatic encephalopathy and increased protein catabo- lism that are common sequelae of cirrhosis.33 Methionine, a known lipotropic, must be activated to S-adenosylmethionine. However, in severe liver disease, the activity of the corresponding enzyme is depressed. In this case supplementation with methionine is not as use- ful. S-adenosylmethionine would be indicated to ameliorate associated deficiencies and resulting pathology.34 Derangement of neurotrans- mitter profiles, particularly due to the low plasma levels of tryptophan typically seen in withdrawing alcoholics, will result if these profiles are not normalized, leading to depression, encephalopathy, and coma.30,32 Anomalous amino acid profiles are aggravated by the low-protein diet used as standard therapy for cirrhosis, but this problem can be avoided through the use of free-form amino acids without the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.30,32 (See “Depression” later for a further dis- cussion of amino acid imbalances.) Although there are some characteristic amino acid abnormalities in alcoholics, an individual approach is indicated owing to differences in nutritional status, biochemistry, and the amount of liver damage. Correction of the imbalances probably requires amino acid chroma- tography for best results.

## Vitamin C

In one study, a deficiency of ascorbic acid was found in 91% of patients with alcohol-related diseases.35 Supplemental ascorbic acid helped ameliorate the effects of acute and chronic ethanol toxicity in exper- imental studies involving humans and guinea pigs, two species unable to synthesize their own ascorbic acid.18,36 There is a direct correlation between leukocyte ascorbic acid levels (a good index of actual body ascorbic acid status), the rate of ethanol clearance from the blood, and the activity of hepatic ADH.17 The evidence suggests that ascorbic acid, a strong reducing agent, can function as an electron donor similar to NAD in ethanol metabolism, thereby increasing the conversion of eth- anol to acetaldehyde and the further catabolism of acetaldehyde.18,36

<!-- chunk -->

## Selenium

Plasma selenium is clearly lower in alcoholic patients. Serum, erythro- cyte, and whole-blood levels of selenium are also decreased in patients with alcohol dependence.22 Low selenium status encourages depressed mood, whereas high dietary or supplementary selenium has been shown to improve mood.37 Research has consistently reported that low selenium status was associated with a significantly increased inci- dence of depression, anxiety, confusion, and hostility.22 Furthermore, when alcohol dependence and depression occur together, there is an increased risk for suicide.38 Given the propensity for low selenium status in alcoholic patients and the relation between selenium levels and mood disorders, sele- nium supplementation is warranted in an attempt to ameliorate the untoward comorbid psychological and physical profile of patients with alcohol abuse or dependence.

<!-- chunk -->

## B Vitamins

Alcoholics are classically deficient in most of the B vitamins.1,11,35 These deficiencies result from various mechanisms: • Low dietary intake • Deactivation of the active form • Impaired conversion to the active form by ethanol or acetaldehyde • Impaired absorption • Decreased storage capacity. Alcohol diminishes thiamine absorption in the intestine and reduces hepatic thiamine storage. It also decreases the phosphorylation of thia- mine, leading to a reduction of the active form of thiamine, which also may contribute to development of thiamine deficiency.39 A thiamine deficiency is both the most common (55% in one study35) and the most serious of the B vitamin deficiencies, because a deficiency causes beriberi and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In addition, evidence indicates that a thiamine deficiency results in greater intake of alcohol, suggesting that thiamine deficiency is a predisposing factor for alcohol dependence.40 It should be noted that, once present, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is refractory to oral doses of thiamine; therefore, rapid replacement of depleted brain thiamine levels by repeated parenteral therapy is required.41

<!-- chunk -->

## 1087CHAPTER 143 Alcohol Dependence

A functional pyridoxine deficiency is also common in alcohol- ics, mostly due to impaired conversion to its active form, pyridox- al-5-phosphate, and enhanced degradation.42 In addition to inhibiting conversion to more active forms, alcohol also decreases the absorption and utilization by the liver and increases the urinary excretion of many B vitamins, especially folic acid.11,43


Magnesium deficiency is common in alcoholics. In fact, hypomagne- semia is present in as many as 60% of alcoholics and is strongly linked to delirium tremens.44 In alcohol-dependent patients, studies suggest measuring ionized magnesium in erythrocytes and plasma as a diag- nostic parameter as opposed to total serum magnesium, because this intracellular biologically active form provides a more complex pic- ture of the body’s condition.45 The lower the concentration of ionized magnesium, the worse the quality of life an alcohol-dependent person might experience. It is thought to be the major reason for the increased cardiovascular disease noted in alcoholics.46 This deficiency is due pri- marily to a reduced magnesium intake coupled with alcohol-induced renal hyperexcretion of magnesium,1,44 which continues during with- drawal despite low serum magnesium levels. Alcoholic cardiomyopa- thy, often associated with thiamine deficiency, may instead be due to a magnesium deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

## Essential Fatty Acids

Ethanol has been shown to interfere with essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism and may produce symptoms of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency if consumed in excess.47 A 5-year study of alcohol-consum- ing rhesus monkeys linked a marginal EFA diet to alcoholic amblyopia, a rare neuropathy characterized by blurred vision, diminished retinal function, and a reduction in visual acuity.48 Brain biopsies showed that the fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) composition of brain spec- imens had decreased significantly in comparison with controls. In the retinas of the alcohol-consuming animals at 5 years, there was a similar decrease in DHA. It may be useful to support neurological function by giving EFAs to prevent these ophthalmological sequelae.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutamine

Glutamine supplementation (1 g per day) has been shown to reduce voluntary alcohol consumption in uncontrolled human studies and experimental animal studies.49-51 Although this research occurred more than 50 years ago, there has never been any follow-up to these preliminary studies. The failure to follow up this line of research is unfortunate, because the results were promising and showed the sup- plement to be safe and relatively inexpensive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychosocial Aspects

Psychological and social measures are critical in the treatment of the alcoholic patient. It is important for the physician to maintain a nonjudgmental but not passive attitude toward the patient. Alcohol dependence should be viewed as a chronic, progressive, addictive, and potentially fatal disease, although many aspects of the alcoholic’s behavior may make it difficult to maintain this objectivity.1 Social support for both patient and family is important, and suc- cess often appears proportional to the involvement of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), counselors, and other social agencies. Because most physicians have not had adequate training or experience in handling the psychosocial aspects of this problem, it is important to establish a close working relationship with an experienced counselor and AA. Al-Anon and Ala-Teen are useful resources for family members. Successful initiation of treatment requires the following: • The patient’s agreement that he or she has an alcohol problem • Education of the patient and family about the physical and psycho- social effects of alcohol dependence • Immediate involvement of the patient in a treatment program. Successful programs usually include strict control of drinking and replacement of the alcohol addiction with another addiction that is nonchemical, time consuming, and heavily supported by family, friends, and peers. Although strict abstinence may not be absolutely necessary, at this time it appears the safest and most effective choice.1

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression

Depression is common among alcoholics and is known to lead to their high suicide rate. Many alcoholics are depressed first and later become alcoholic (primary depressives), whereas others become alcoholic first and later develop a depressive condition in the context of their alcohol dependence (secondary depressives). Alterations in the metabolism of serotonin and the availability of its precursor, tryptophan, have been implicated in some forms of depression, whereas other forms have been linked to alterations in catecholamine metabolism and tyrosine availability. Alcoholics have severely depleted levels of tryptophan, which may explain both the depression and sleep disturbances common in alcohol dependence, because brain serotonin levels depend on circulating tryptophan levels.52 Ethanol impairs tryptophan trans- port into the brain. The enzyme tryptophan pyrrolase, considered to be rate-limiting in tryptophan catabolism, is more active in rats during alcohol withdrawal.31 In one study, 5 of 6 chronic alcoholics had no detectable plasma tryptophan on withdrawal.30 The tryp- tophan levels returned to normal after 6 days of treatment and abstinence. Another factor influencing tryptophan uptake into the brain is competition from amino acids—tyrosine, phenylalanine, valine, leu- cine, isoleucine, and methionine—that share the same transport; many of these are elevated in malnourished alcoholics.30,31 Alcoholics have significantly depressed ratios of tryptophan to these amino acids in comparison with normal controls, with depressed alcoholics having the lowest ratios.31 The major amino acids, whose elevated levels help lower this ratio, are the catecholamine precursors, tyrosine and phenylalanine. Elevated plasma catecholamine levels are common in alcoholics and may contribute to depression.53 An interesting finding is that taurine is also low in depressed alcoholics, with the lowest levels being reported in psychotic alcoholics.30

## Miscellaneous Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Intestinal Flora

The intestinal microflora is severely deranged in alcoholics.54 Clinical and preclinical data suggest that alcohol-related disorders are associated with quantitative and qualitative dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiota and may be associated with increased GIT inflammation, intestinal hyperpermeability resulting in endotox- emia, systemic inflammation, and tissue damage/organ pathologies, including ALD (Fig. 143.3).55 Colonization of the small intestine by endotoxin-producing bacteria may lead to malabsorption of fats, carbohydrates, protein, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 . This is proba- bly the cause of the abnormalities of the small intestine commonly found in alcoholics. Alcohol ingestion also increases intestinal per- meability to endotoxins and macromolecules, allowing increased toxic and antigenic effects.56 The ensuing allergic reactions and deposition of immune complexes probably contribute to the many complications of alcohol dependence and, considering the addic- tive tendency of food allergies, may also contribute to alcoholic cravings.

## 1088SECTION 6 Diseases


Involvement of the alcoholic patient in a graded, individually tai- lored fitness program has been shown to improve the likelihood of maintaining abstinence.57 Research has shown that regular exercise is effective in alleviating anxiety and depression and enables indi- viduals to respond better to stress. Improved fitness may allow for more effective responses to emotional upset, thereby reducing the patient’s likelihood of resorting to alcohol when he or she is involved in conflict.

## Kudzu (Pueraria lobata)

Kudzu is one of the earliest medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. It has many profound pharmacological actions, including antidipsotropic (antialcohol abuse) activity.58,59 Two of its isofla- vones, daidzin and daidzein, account for this effect. It appears to act by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH-2).59 A deficiency of this enzyme reduces the risk of alcohol dependence. Decreased drink- ing due to ALDH-2 inhibition is attributed to the aversive properties of acetaldehyde accumulated during alcohol consumption. However, daidzin can reduce drinking in some rodents without necessarily increasing acetaldehyde. In human studies, the results have been mixed. In one study, kudzu treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of beers consumed, which was paralleled by an increase in the number of sips and the time to consume each beer and a decrease in the volume of each sip.60 However, in a double-blind trial, kudzu root extract (1.2 g twice a day) produced no statistically significance difference in craving and sobriety scores in comparison with the placebo group.61 It may be that kudzu reduces alcohol intake without significantly affecting cravings.

<!-- chunk -->

## Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum)

The flavonoid complex of milk thistle (silymarin) appears to be use- ful for the alcoholic, especially in the presence of considerable liver involvement or cirrhosis. Silymarin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the full spectrum of alcohol-related liver disease, from relatively mild to serious cirrhosis. Perhaps the most significant benefit is extending the life span of these patients. In one study, cirrhotics (46 with alcoholic cirrhosis) received silymarin, and 83 cir- rhotics (45 with alcoholic cirrhosis) received a placebo.62 The mean observation period was 41 months. In the treatment group, there were 24 deaths, among which 18 were related to liver disease; among the controls, there were 37 deaths with 31 related to liver disease. The 4-year survival rate was 58% in the treatment group compared with 39% in the controls. Silymarin can also improve immune function in patients with cir- rhosis.63 Whether this effect is involved in the hepatoprotective action or a result of improved liver function has yet to be determined.


Alcohol dependence is difficult to treat. Although many therapeutic regimens have been attempted, there has been little documented long- term success except for that of AA (and even the overall success of this program is highly controversial). The approach presented here is unique in that we have attempted to develop an integrated, whole- person, stage-oriented program. The treatment of the alcoholic patient must be optimized for the four stages of alcohol dependence: active alcohol consumption, with- drawal, recovery, and recovered. The recovery stage is defined here as the period between withdrawal and full reestablishment of normal metabolic function. All alcoholics, at whatever stage, benefit the most by employing simultaneous counseling, lifestyle, and metabolism-bal- ancing therapies. The following are the recommended therapies in the usual context, with additional recommendations for each stage. Also, a complete diagnostic workup is necessary owing to the high risk that the alcoholic patient will develop a wide variety of clinical and subclinical diseases.

## Recommendations for All Four Stages


Stabilization of blood sugar levels is critical to successful treatment. Although a strict hypoglycemic diet may not be warranted, most of the dietary guidelines must be followed. These guidelines include elimina- tion of all simple sugars (foods containing added sucrose, fructose, or glucose; fruit juice; dried fruit; and low-fiber fruits such as grapes and citrus fruits); limitation of processed carbohydrates (e.g., white flour, instant potatoes, white rice); and an increase in complex carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains, vegetables, beans).


• Vitamin A: 5000 IU a day • Vitamin B complex: 20 times the recommended daily allowance • Vitamin C: 1 g two times a day • Vitamin E: 400 IU a day (d– α -tocopherol) • Magnesium: 250 mg two times a day • Selenium: 200 mg a day • Zinc: 30 mg a day (picolinate) • Carnitine: 500 mg two times a day (l-carnitine) • Glutamine: 1 g a day • Lactobacillus acidophilus: 1 tsp a day


A graded program should be established, using heart-rate response to determine intensity. The patient should exercise 5 to 7 times a week for 20 to 30 minutes at an intensity sufficient to raise the heart rate to 60% to 80% of maximum for the age group.

<!-- chunk -->

## Counseling

The physician dealing with alcoholism should have a good working relationship with AA and an experienced counselor who has particular expertise in working with alcoholics. Additional recommendations for the four stages follow.

<!-- chunk -->

## Specific Recommendations for Each Stage

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage I: Active Alcohol Consumption

The physician should work with family, peers, social contacts, and whomever else is involved with the patient to elicit his or her rec- ognition of an alcohol problem and willingness to enter a treatment program. Additional supplements include the following: • Pyridoxal-5-phosphate: 20 mg a day • Riboflavin: 100 mg a day • Vitamin A: 5000 IU a day • Zinc: 30 mg a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage II: Withdrawal

The severity of symptomatology varies widely, although it is usually proportional to the degree of physiological dependence and duration of the disease. Milder cases usually start within a few hours after cessation of drinking and typically resolve within 48 hours. More severe cases usually occur only in patients older than 30 years of age and usually develop after about 48 hours of abstinence. These patients should be admitted to an inpatient facility. Some institutions may not allow the use of supplements; this policy should be checked before a patient is admitted. Additional supplements include the following: • Tryptophan: 3 g a day • Riboflavin: 100 mg a day • Electrolyte replacement as necessary • Flaxseed oil: 1 tbsp three times a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage III: Recovering

A strong network of caring family, friends, and peers should be estab- lished, if possible, to regularly support the patient, who would do well to become involved and busy with intense, people-oriented activities. It is also vital for the patient to recognize that alcohol is no answer to the stresses of life; he or she should be helped to develop more effective ways of handling adversity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stage IV: Recovering to Advanced Recovery

The patient’s support group must always be maintained. Continued total abstinence is the best policy, although carefully controlled drink- ing may be possible. After a 6-month abstinence, supplement dosages may be slowly reduced to 25% of the initial dosages.

## 1091CHAPTER 144 Alzheimer’s Disease

least 40% of all patients with AD have a genetic variant of APOe4 gene that increases this protein, leading to a significantly greater risk for AD. The e2-type is associated with significant protection. Although the effect of ApoE isoforms on amyloid β metabolism have been consid- ered as its main role in Alzheimer’s disease, emerging data suggest that ApoE may also affect AD pathogenesis through amyloid β independent pathways (Fig. 144.1). Literature is also accumulating regarding the role of genetically linked aberrant immune system regulation of inflammation as a possi- ble contributor to AD. Although innate immune function in the brain is normally modulated to remove plaque in an attempt to maintain health, research is beginning to characterize a chronic and excessive reaction to immune protofibrils of amyloid proteins in the brain that can promote disease.3 As a result, immunotherapeutic approaches have recently been developed for the treatment of AD. Chief among these strategies is to immunize AD patients with A β peptides so that they will generate antibodies that bind to A β protein and enhance its clearance.4 Although preclinical studies were successful, the initial human clinical trial of an active A β vaccine was halted owing to the development of meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of the vac- cinated AD patients. Although genes play a significant role in determining susceptibility to AD, lifestyle and environmental factors also play significant roles. Emerging research reveals that dietary factors are important. Poor- quality diets with excess saturated or trans–fatty acids may predispose neurons to environmental toxicities.5,6 Some data suggest that abnor- mal sleep–wake cycles and decreased morning light exposure may play a role in the expression of AD. Traumatic injury to the head; chronic exposure to aluminum, silicon, or both; exposure to neurotoxins from environmental sources; and free radical damage have all been impli- cated as causative factors as well. As in the pathophysiology of other chronic degenerative diseases, there is considerable evidence that increased oxidative damage plays a central role. Therapies designed to support antioxidant mechanisms may be quite helpful in the preven- tion of AD.7 The tremendous increase in AD parallels the rise in type 2 diabe- tes and insulin resistance, suggesting a possible connection. It is well established that individuals with type 2 diabetes have a 1.5- to 4-fold higher than normal risk for AD and for vascular dementia. Impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance in the brain or the decrease in cerebral insulin receptors associated with aging may be another important factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, hypergly- cemia induces increased peripheral utilization of insulin, resulting in reduced insulin transport into the brain. Insufficient insulin signaling make neurons energy-deficient and vulnerable to oxidizing or other metabolic insults, leading to the destruction of mitochondria and ultimately the neuron. Cerebral hypoinsulinemia (as well as hyperin- sulinemia) leads to β -amyloid accumulation and increased tau phos- phorylation. Measures to improve glycemic control and improve both peripheral and brain insulin sensitivity appear to be important steps in the prevention of AD.8,9 Other known risk factors include family history, hypertension and hypotension, high cholesterol levels, low levels of physical activity, obesity, and heart failure. Reduced cerebral blood flow and dysfunc- tion of the neurovascular unit appear to be the main reasons heart failure contributes to the development of AD (Fig. 144.2).10 However, multiple cardiovascular conditions often coexist, suggesting that sev- eral mechanisms underlying cardiovascular dysfunction may contrib- ute to cognitive decline.

## Aluminum

Considerable attention has focused on the association of aluminum concentration in the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT). Whether the alumi- num concentration develops in response to AD or whether it initiates the lesions has not yet been determined, but significant evidence shows that it contributes, possibly significantly, to the disease. Aluminum has a strong affinity for the paired helical filament tau (PHF-t), which is involved in the formation of the NFTs. In fact, stud- ies have demonstrated that aluminum is the cofactor along with this tau filament in the formation of the NFTs.11 The aluminum selectively binds to PHF-t, induces PHF-t to aggregate, and retards the brain’s ability to break down PHF-t. Aluminum’s role in AD is further sup- ported by an animal study that evaluated long-term exposure to eco- logic doses of aluminum. In this study, researchers found ghostlike neurons with cytoplasmic and nuclear vacuolations, together with alu- minum deposits. The hippocampus contained neuritic plaques, and the cerebrovasculature exhibited amyloid deposits. Researchers also found behavioral changes in these rats reminiscent of those observed in AD.12

## 1092SECTION 6 Diseases

A great deal of circumstantial evidence links chronic aluminum exposure to AD. Increasing aluminum concentrations in the brain could explain why AD increases with increasing age. A study of 356 healthy people showed that serum aluminum concentration increases as people age.13 Individuals with AD have significantly higher aluminum levels than both healthy people and patients with other types of dementias, such as those due to alcohol, atheroscle- rosis, and stroke. Efforts to remove the aluminum appear to help somewhat, but such measures are probably too late once the dis- ease is well established. For example, intramuscular injections of deferoxamine (a chelating agent for the removal of iron and alumi- num) over a 2-year period showed a significant slowing of the rate of decline in 48 AD patients.14 Even in people without mental disease, elevated aluminum lev- els are associated with poorer mental function. In a study of patients undergoing dialysis, the 13 patients who had a positive aluminum deferoxamine test (a measure of the amount of aluminum in the body) were compared with 13 who had a negative test. Subjecting the entire group to four attention tests and two memory tests revealed that those with higher levels of aluminum had a moderate to considerable distur- bance of mental function.14 The aluminum appears to come from the water supply, food, antacids, and antiperspirants. The most significant source is drink- ing water, because the aluminum in water is in a more bioavailable and thus potentially a more toxic form. Researchers measured the aluminum absorption of tap water by adding a small amount of soluble aluminum in a radioactive form to the stomachs of ani- mals. They discovered that the trace amounts of aluminum from this single exposure immediately entered the animals’ brain tissue. The frightening news is that aluminum in water occurs not only naturally but is also added (in the form of alum) to treat some water supplies.15

## Particulate Matter

Air pollution, already shown to begin and fuel neuroinflammation, has also been implicated in increased levels of amyloid deposits and tau protein formation. Particulate matter (PM) can penetrate throughout the body, including the brain, where it is closely linked to inflamma- tion. Making PM particularly toxic is the adsorption of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to their surface, bypassing normal protec- tive systems. Postmortem assessment of the brains of cognitively intact persons revealed that those who lived in areas of higher vehicular air pollution had greater inflammatory markers and β -amyloid in their frontal cortex and hippocampus (the areas needed for memory func- tion) along with their olfactory lobe.16 Children living in the metropolitan area of Mexico City with both pre- and postnatal exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 have been found to have increased hyperphosphorylation of tau, along with increased levels of β -amyloid.17 Those children also exhibited decreased cog- nitive function (attention, memory and IQ) and decreased olfactory sense. The children with APOe4 had greater problems, especially with olfaction.18

## Pesticides

Pesticide use and exposure has also been strongly associated with higher risks for developing AD. A large study in the southern Spain comprised 17,420 subjects whose hospital records were reviewed between 1998 and 2005. The subjects were classified according to the agricultural pesticide usage in the regions that they lived in. Person living in regions with higher pesticide use were over twice as likely to develop AD and 87% more likely to commit suicide.19 A study of 1507 elderly French individuals revealed that those who had been occupationally exposed to pesticides in their younger years were 2.39 times more likely to develop AD than were individuals in other occupations.20 The largest prospective study to look at the relationship between pesticide use and AD was done in Cache County, Utah.21 More than 3000 individuals above the age of 65 were enrolled and screened for dementia at baseline and classified according to pesticide-exposure levels. Cognitive function was reassessed after 3, 7, and 10 years. After adjusting for various factors, including APOE4 allele status, it was found that study participants with higher pesticide exposures were 38% more likely to have dementia and 42% more likely to develop AD. When just organophosphates and organochlorine pesticides were singled out, researchers found that chlorinated pesticide exposure increase AD risk by 49%, and organophosphate use increased it by 53%.


A comprehensive diagnostic workup is paramount in the approach to the patient with dementia. It is important to rule out conditions that can mimic dementia. For example, depression, which can mimic dementia in the elderly, is common. Table 144.1 lists other possible causes of dementia. The most common reversible cause of dementia is drug toxicity. Other important causes are metabolic and nutritional disorders, such as hypoglycemia; thyroid disturbances; and vitamin B 12 , folate, and thiamine deficiencies. A comprehensive evaluation should include22: • A detailed history • Neurological and physical examinations • Psychological evaluation with particular attention to depression • A general medical evaluation with emphasis on the detection of subtle metabolic, toxic, or cardiopulmonary disorders that can pre- cipitate confusion, especially in the elderly • A series of standardized neurophysiology tests such as the Mini Mental State Examination or Folstein test to document the type and severity of cognitive impairment. Table 144.2 lists recommended tests for appropriate laboratory assessment. The EEG is an important diagnostic tool serving to differentiate types of dementia. Although a normal EEG does not rule out the diag- nosis of dementia, particularly in its early stages, it does provide valu- able information. AD is associated with a characteristic symmetrical, usually diffuse slowing of the EEG. More important, the EEG differ- entiates focal (e.g., intracranial mass or vascular disease) from diffuse (e.g., metabolic disorders or normal-pressure hydrocephalus) brain dysfunction. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emis- sion tomography (PET) can help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. A technique known as PiB PET has been developed for directly and clearly imaging amyloid deposits in vivo, using a chemical tracer that binds selectively to the A β deposits. This modality shows tremendous promise.

## Fingerprint Patterns

Abnormal fingerprint patterns are associated with both AD and Down syndrome.23 In comparison with the normal population, AD and Down syndrome patients show an increased number of ulnar loops on the fingertips, with a concomitant decrease in whorls, radial loops, and arches. Ulnar loops (pointing toward the ulnar bone, away from the thumb) are frequently found on all

## 1093CHAPTER 144 Alzheimer’s Disease

fingertips. Radial loops (pointing toward the thumb), when they do appear, tend to be shifted away from the index and middle fingers— where they most commonly occur—to the ring and little fingers. In patients with this fingerprint pattern, which is characteristic of AD, it is recommended that an aggressive preventive approach be insti- tuted immediately.


The primary areas of intervention from a natural medicine perspective involve prevention by addressing suspected pathophysiology, avoiding environmental neurotoxins, and using natural measures to improve mental function. In the advanced stages of AD, natural measures pro- vide only limited benefit.


Dietary factors are clearly important in the etiology of AD. Food choices consistent with the standard American diet are associated with a significant risk for the development of AD. A diet high in saturated fat and trans–fatty acids and low in dietary antioxidants may lead to increased serum and brain concentrations of aluminum and transi- tion metal ions, which are implicated in oxidative stress, potentially leading to the neurological damage characteristic of AD. In addition, poor-quality diets may also increase the prevalence of AD by eliciting cerebral inflammation, which may cause the neurological damage that results in AD.5,6,14 Many dietary risk factors for AD are shared with those implicated in atherosclerosis. Likewise, adherence to a Mediterranean diet is asso- ciated with decreased cognitive decline, just as it is with a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. Prospective studies have provided clear evidence that following a Mediterranean diet is associated with slower cognitive decline, reduced risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, reduced risk of AD, and a decreased all- cause mortality in AD patients. These findings suggest a lower risk not only for AD, but also for predementia syndromes and their progres- sion to overt dementia.24,25 The key dietary factors from epidemiological data that reduce AD risk are higher fish consumption (and omega-3 fatty acids), mono- unsaturated fatty acids (primarily from olive oil), light to moderate alcohol use (primarily red wine), and increased nonstarchy vegeta- ble and fruit consumption. It is likely that the combination of all these factors rather than any single one provides the highest degree of protection.24,25 Given the ability of the Mediterranean diet to reduce inflamma- tion and improve insulin sensitivity, it is assumed that this action may

be of extreme importance in its ability to reduce AD. However, in a 4-year prospective study, the lower risk of AD demonstrated with the Mediterranean diet did not seem to be mediated by C-reactive pro- tein, fasting insulin, or adiponectin levels.26 Other aspects of the diet or specific foods are likely responsible, including dietary components that work directly on reducing β -amyloid formation or deposition. For example, polyphenols found in grapes, grape seed extract, and red wine have been shown to prevent β -amyloid formation and promote tau disassembly.27,28 Pharmacokinetic studies in animals with radio- labeled grape polyphenols show absorption into the brain after oral administration.29 Even something as simple as celery (Apium graveolens) consump- tion may offer significant protection against AD. Celery and cel- ery seed extracts contain a unique compound, 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), that is responsible for both the characteristic odor of celery and its health benefits. In an animal model of AD, NBP treatment significantly improved learning deficits as well as long-term spatial memory. Furthermore, NBP treatment also significantly reduced total cerebral β -amyloid plaque deposition and lowered brain β -am- yloid levels. It was also shown that NBP markedly directed amyloid precursor protein processing toward a pathway that precludes β -am- yloid formation. The researchers concluded, “NBP shows promising preclinical potential as a multitarget drug for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.”30 The research on grape polyphenols and NBP stimulates a power- ful question. How many other foods contain unique compounds that address the pathophysiology of AD? From preliminary investigations, it appears there are many; especially promising are sources of phenols and polyphenols.31–35

## Estrogen

Estrogen has been asserted to offer protective and possibly therapeu- tic benefits in AD. However, the epidemiological and clinical evidence to support the potential benefits of estrogen is contradictory. Sixteen population-based studies have indicated that women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) had a lower rate of AD.36 However, the problem with these studies is that the women taking HRT were much healthier before taking the hormones compared with the control group (i.e., women who are prescribed HRT are less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, and history of stroke than nonusers).36 A ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the effects of hormone therapy on amyloid- β deposition in recently postmenopausal women. 37 Participants within 5 to 36 months past menopause in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, were randomized to: 1) 0.45 mg per day oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE); 2) μ g per day transdermal β -estradiol; or 3) placebo pills and patch for 4 years. Oral progesterone (200 mg per day) was given to active treatment groups for 12 days each month. PET imaging was performed in 68 of the 118 participants at the Mayo Clinic approx- imately 7 years post randomization and 3 years after stopping ran- domized treatment. Transdermal β -estradiol therapy in recently postmenopausal women was associated with a reduced amyloid- β deposition, particularly in apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 allele (APOE ɛ 4) carriers. Data from the only large randomized controlled trial published to date, the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study, did not confirm these observations and even suggested an increase in dementia risk for women using HRT compared with controls, espe- cially in the cases of women given HRT after menopause.38 Clinical tri- als in women with AD have concluded that estrogen therapy does not improve dementia symptoms in women with AD and should definitely be avoided postmenopause.39–41 Given the cloud of uncertainty about the benefits of HRT, it seems most reasonable to consider that at this point the risks of conventional estrogen therapy to prevent AD out- weigh the benefits. See Chapter 196 on menopause for a discussion of the critical differences.

## Environmental Toxins

Encouraging the avoidance of all known sources of environmental neurotoxins, especially aluminum and pesticides, is strongly recom- mended. Eliminating aluminum-containing antacids, using alumi- num-containing antiperspirants, cooking in aluminum pots and pans, wrapping food in aluminum foil, and consuming nondairy cream- ers—certainly seem appropriate. Aluminum is also found in baking powder and table salt to keep them from becoming lumpy. In addition, citric acid, as well as calcium citrate supplements, appear to increase the efficiency of absorption of aluminum (but not lead) from water and food.42 Aluminum absorption can be decreased by magnesium, because magnesium competes with aluminum for absorption, not only in the intestines but also at the blood-brain barrier.43 A diet rich in magnesium is recommended, focusing on unprocessed foods, avoiding milk and dairy products, and increasing the consumption of vegeta- bles, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. The most effective ways to decrease pesticides are to eat organically grown foods and avoid use of pesticides in homes and yards.

# NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Nutritional status is directly related to cognitive function in the elderly.44 Given the frequency of nutrient deficiency in the elderly pop- ulation, it is likely that many cases of impaired mental function may have a nutritional etiology. As pointed out earlier in this chapter, diet is critically important in the prevention and arrest of AD, with various components working together in a synergistic fashion to address many of the key underlying pathophysiological features of AD.


Considerable evidence indicates that oxidative damage plays a major role in the development and progression of AD.7,45,46 Epidemiological evidence suggests that antioxidant nutrients offer significant protec- tion against AD.5,48 Prospective and clinical studies have primarily focused on vitamins C and E and β -carotene with somewhat favor- able results (Table 144.3).45,48–51 As with other chronic degenerative diseases, better results may be achieved with a broader range of sup- plemental nutrients. For example, in a French cohort of middle-aged adults, 13 years of daily supplementation of 120 mg of ascorbic acid, mg of vitamin E, 6 mg of β -carotene, 100 mcg of selenium, and 20 mg of zinc compared with placebo was significantly associated with bet- ter verbal memory, a cognitive domain that is particularly vulnerable to pathological aging and AD. These results appear to be significantly better than those achieved with vitamins C, E, and β -carotene either alone or in combination. It is entirely possible (and likely probable) that vitamins E and C, and β -carotene may simply be markers of increased “phyto- chemical antioxidant” intake rather than playing a significant role on their own. Fruits and vegetables contain an array of antioxidant compounds beyond nutritional antioxidants. Some of these com- pounds may exert specific effects of considerable benefit against the pathophysiology of AD. Often researchers make the mistake of thinking that the antioxidant activity of a particular fruit or vegetable is due solely to its vitamin C, E, or β -carotene content. However, these nutrient antioxidants often account for only a small fraction of a food’s antioxidant effect. For example, these nutrients account for only about 0.5% of the total antioxidant activity of an apple. The overwhelming antioxidant activity of fruits and vegetables comes

from phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, phenols, and other carot- enoids.52 Several phytochemicals are showing tremendous promise in protecting against AD by interfering with the formation and depo- sition of β -amyloid.31–33

## Thiamine

Although severe thiamine deficiency is relatively uncommon except in people with alcoholism, many Americans do not consume even the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 1.5 mg, especially elderly people. In an attempt to gauge the prevalence of thiamine deficiency in the geriatric population, 30 unselected consecutive patients visiting a university outpatient clinic in Tampa, Florida, were tested for thia- mine levels. Depending on the thiamine measurement (plasma vs. red blood cell thiamine), low levels (defined as a level below the lowest reference range for younger age groups) were found in 57% and 33%, respectively.53 In addition to its role as a nutrient, thiamine also demonstrates some pharmacological effects on the brain. Specifically, it mimics the important neurotransmitter involved in memory—acetylcho- line. Thiamine has been shown to potentiate and mimic the effects of acetylcholine in the brain.54 This effect explains the positive clinical results that have been noted for thiamine, (3 to 8 g per day) in improv- ing mental function in AD and age-related impaired mental function (senility).55,56 High-dose thiamine supplementation exerts its benefits without side effects. These results highlight the growing body of evidence that a signifi- cant percentage of the geriatric population is deficient in one or more of the B vitamins. Given the essential role of thiamine and other B vita- mins in normal human physiology, especially cardiovascular and brain function, routine B-vitamin supplementation appears to be worth- while in this age group.

## Vitamin B


Vitamin B 12 deficiency results in impaired nerve function, which can cause numbness, paresthesia, or a burning feeling in the feet as well as impaired mental function, which in the elderly population can mimic AD. Vitamin B 12 deficiency is thought to be quite common in elders and is a major cause of depression in this age group. Determination of vitamin B 12 deficiency is best achieved by measuring the level in the blood (serum cobalamin) or the level of methylmalonic acid in the urine. In addition, measurement of the level of plasma homocysteine is an additional method to determine the status of both vitamin B 12 and folate. Several investigators have found that the level of vitamin B 12 declines with age and that vitamin B 12 deficiency is found in 3% to 42% of persons age 65 and older. Diagnosing cobalamin deficiency early in the elderly population is important because it is easily treatable and, if left untreated, can lead to impaired neurological and cognitive function.57,58 In one study among 100 consecutive geriatric outpatients who were seen in office-based settings for various acute and chronic med- ical illnesses but not for vitamin B 12 deficiency–related diseases like pernicious anemia, 11 patients had serum cobalamin levels at pmol/L or below; 30 patients had levels between 148 and 295 pmol/L; and 59 patients had levels above 296 pmol/L.59 After the initial cobal- amin determination, the subjects were followed for up to 3 years. The patients with cobalamin levels below 148 pmol/L were treated and not included in the analysis of declining cobalamin levels. The average annual decline in serum cobalamin level was 18 pmol/L for patients who had higher initial serum cobalamin levels (actual range, 224–292 pmol/L). For patients with lower initial cobalamin levels, the average annual serum cobalamin decline was much higher, at pmol/L. These results indicate that measurement of the level of vitamin B 12 in the blood (serum cobalamin), the urinary excretion of methylma- lonic acid or the level of homocysteine60 as a screening test for vita- min B 12 deficiency appears to be indicated in elderly patients, given the positive cost-benefit ratio.61,62 To test for vitamin B 12 deficiency, the urinary methylmalonic acid assay is perhaps the best because it is sen- sitive as well as noninvasive and relatively convenient for the patient. Correction of an underlying vitamin B 12 deficiency can significantly improve mental function and quality of life in these patients. A grow- ing body of literature demonstrates clear correlations between high levels of serum homocysteine and cardiovascular disease and, more recently, dementia and AD. High homocysteine levels (>14 mmol/L) nearly double the risk of AD.63 The importance of a detailed examination in elderly patients with mental symptoms is highlighted by results from a study that analyzed the plasma homocysteine, serum cobalamin, and blood folate in consecutive patients referred to a geriatric psychiatric ward in Sweden for the diagnosis of mental disease.64 Patients who were deficient in vitamin B 12 or folic acid or who had elevated levels of homocysteine were given vitamin B 12 (dosage not specified) or folic acid (10 mg per day), or both. When individuals with low cobalamin levels were sup- plemented with vitamin B 12 , significant clinical improvements were noted. In other studies, supplementation with vitamin B 12 has shown tremendous benefit in reversing impaired mental function due to low levels of vitamin B 12 .57 In one large study, a complete recovery was observed in 61% of similar cases of mental impairment.65 The fact that 39% did not respond is probably a result of long-term low levels of vitamin B 12 . Several studies have shown that the best clinical

## 1096SECTION 6 Diseases

responders are those who have been showing signs of impaired men- tal function for less than 6 months.34 In one study, 18 subjects with low levels of serum cobalamin and evidence of mental impairment were given vitamin B 12 . Only those patients who had symptoms for less than 1 year showed improvement.66 The importance of diagnos- ing and correcting low vitamin B 12 levels in the elderly population cannot be overstated. Serum vitamin B 12 levels are significantly low and vitamin B 12 deficiency is significantly common in AD patients.57,67,68 It has been demonstrated that an oral daily dose as low as 50 mcg can significantly increase serum vitamin B 12 levels in vitamin B 12 –deficient elderly per- sons.69 Supplementation of vitamin B 12 , folic acid, or both may result in complete reversal in some patients, but generally there is little improvement in patients who have had AD symptoms for more than months. It has been hypothesized that prolonged low levels of vitamin B 12 may lead to irreversible changes that will not respond to supple- mentation. Vitamin B 12 supplementation for elderly subjects with AD will improve hematological parameters but will not usually improve mental function.70 Vitamin B 12 is available in several forms. The most common form is cyanocobalamin; however, vitamin B 12 is active in the human body in only two forms: methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Although methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin are active immediately on absorption, cyanocobalamin must be converted to either methylcobal- amin or adenosylcobalamin by removal of the cyanide molecule and addition of either a methyl or adenosyl group. This conversion may be reduced with aging and may be another factor responsible for the vitamin B 12 disturbances noted in the elderly population.


Zinc deficiency is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in elderly people and has been suggested to be a major factor in the devel- opment of AD.71 Included in the list of zinc-containing enzymes are most enzymes involved in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. It has been suggested that dementia, possibly because of a long-term zinc deficiency, may represent the long-term cascading effects of error-prone or ineffective DNA-handling enzymes in nerve cells.72 In addition, zinc is required by many antioxidant enzymes, includ- ing superoxide dismutase. The end result could be the destruction of nerve cells and the formation of NFTs and plaques. The levels of zinc in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with AD are markedly decreased, and there is a strong inverse correlation between serum zinc levels and the senile plaque count.73 Dietary zinc deficiency readily decreases serum zinc levels in mice and rats, although it increases serum corticosterone levels through the increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity (Fig. 144.3).74 Zinc deficiency can reduce histochemically reactive zinc levels, which are estimated to be susceptible to aging. Zinc deficiency, as well as aging, appear to be significant risk factors for AD. Zinc supplementation has demonstrated good benefits in people with AD. In one study, 10 patients with AD were given 27 mg per day of zinc (as zinc aspartate). Only two patients failed to show improve- ment in memory, understanding, communication, and social contact. In one 79-year-old patient, the response was labeled “unbelievable” by both medical staff and family.75 Unfortunately there does not seem to be much interest in the scientific community in following up these impressive results with zinc therapy. The medical literature acknowledges zinc’s apparent duality as “The Zinc Paradox.”76 Fueling this ambivalence is conflicting infor- mation that zinc may be problematic for AD patients because, in vitro, it accelerates the formation of insoluble β -amyloid peptide.77 Although zinc is neurotoxic at high concentrations and accumulates at sites of degeneration, total tissue zinc is markedly reduced in the brains of AD patients. Other research has shown a much higher concentration of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in and around the damaged brain tissue of AD patients.78 This finding suggests that the increased con- centration of zinc in the damaged areas is due to the body’s efforts to neutralize free radicals through the increased local production of dismutases. A possible corollary is that the higher focal levels of zinc result in increased amyloid formation when the free radical scavenging mechanisms have been inadequate.

## Phosphatidylcholine

Because dietary phosphatidylcholine can increase acetylcholine levels in the brain in normal patients and AD is characterized by a decrease in cholinergic transmission, it seems reasonable to assume that phospha- tidylcholine supplementation would benefit AD patients. However, the basic defect in cholinergic transmission in AD relates to impaired activity of the enzyme acetylcholine transferase. This enzyme combines choline (as provided by phosphatidylcholine) with an acetyl molecule to form acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter. Providing more choline does not necessarily increase the activity of this key enzyme, so phos- phatidylcholine supplementation is not beneficial in the majority of patients with AD. Not surprisingly, clinical trials using phosphatidyl- choline have largely been disappointing. Studies have shown incon- sistent improvements in memory from choline supplementation in both normal and AD patients.79–82 The studies have been criticized for small sample size, low dose of phosphatidylcholine, and poor design. Furthermore, some researchers are questioning the form of choline used.83 Other forms, such as phosphatidylserine or choline alphoscer- ate,84 may prove more useful in supporting cholinergic transmission. In a patient with mild to moderate dementia, the use of a high-qual- ity phosphatidylcholine preparation may be worth a try. A dosage of 15 to 25 g per day of phosphatidylcholine is required. If there is no noticeable improvement within 2 weeks, supplementation should be discontinued.

## Phosphatidylserine

Phosphatidylserine is the major phospholipid in the brain, where it plays a major role in determining the integrity and fluidity of cell membranes. Normally, the brain can manufacture sufficient lev- els of phosphatidylserine, but a deficiency of methyl donors like S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), folic acid, and vitamin B 12 or essential fatty acids may inhibit the production of sufficient phosphatidylser- ine. Low levels of phosphatidylserine in the brain are associated with impaired mental function and depression in the elderly. The primary use of phosphatidylserine is in the treatment of depression, impaired mental function, or both in the elderly, and also Zn Zn Zn Zinc deficiency Aging?

in the treatment of AD. To date, the 11 double-blind published studies have all reported the successful use of phosphatidylserine in the treat- ment of age-related cognitive decline, AD, or depression.85–95 In the largest study, a total of 494 elderly patients (between 65 and 93 years of age) with moderate to severe senility were given either phosphati- dylserine (100 mg three times a day) or a placebo for 6 months.95 The patients were assessed for mental performance, behavior, and mood at the beginning and end of the study. Statistically significant (P <0.01) improvements were noted in mental function, mood, and behavior for the phosphatidylserine group.

## Acetyl- L-Carnitine

A great amount of research has been conducted over the past decade with acetyl- l-carnitine (LAC) in the treatment of AD, senile depres- sion, and age-related memory defects. LAC is composed of acetic acid and l-carnitine bound together. This reaction occurs naturally in the human brain. Therefore it is not exactly known how much more of an effect is achieved with LAC versus l-carnitine. However, LAC is thought to be substantially more active than other forms of carnitine in conditions involving the brain.95,96 The close structural similarity between LAC and acetylcholine led to an interest in using LAC in AD. Research has shown that LAC does mimic acetylcholine and is of benefit, not only in patients with ear- ly-stage AD, but also in elderly patients who are depressed or have impaired memory.96 It has also been shown to act as a powerful anti- oxidant in the brain cell, to stabilize cell membranes, and to improve energy production in the brain cell, as well as enhance or mimic the function of acetylcholine.97 The latest meta-analysis involving studies of LAC in mild cog- nitive impairment and mild (early) AD is promising in terms of showing both clinical and psychometric improvements. Double- blind, placebo-controlled prospective parallel-group comparison studies of at least 3 months’ duration were reviewed. Using a dose range of 1.5 to 3 g per day, treatment time points were assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. This analysis showed a significant advantage for acetyl-l-carnitine, compared with placebo. The advantage for acetyl-l-carnitine was seen by the time of the first assessment at months and increased over time. Additionally, acetyl-l-carnitine was well tolerated in all studies.98 Further studies also show efficacy regarding the use of LAC in sit- uations where AD patients were unresponsive to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. One study evaluated the effect of LAC, using 2 g per day orally for 3 months in association with donepezil or rivastigmine in 23 patients with mild AD who had not responded to treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-Is). Clinical effects were evalu- ated by assessing cognitive functions, functional status, and behavioral symptoms. The response rate, which was 38% after AChE-I treatment, increased to 50% after the addition of LAC, indicating that the com- bination of both the pharmaceutical and LAC works better than the pharmacological treatment alone.99 The memory impairment need not be as severe as in AD for LAC to demonstrate benefit.100–102 In one double-blind study of 236 elderly subjects with mild mental deterioration, as evidenced by detailed clin- ical assessment, the group receiving 1500 mg per day of LAC demon- strated significant improvement in mental function, particularly in memory and constructional thinking.103

## Dehydroepiandrosterone

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the most abundant hormone in the bloodstream and is found in extremely high concentrations in the brain. As DHEA levels decline dramatically with aging, low levels of DHEA in the blood and brain are thought to contribute to many symp- toms associated with aging, including impaired mental function. Although DHEA itself has no known function, it does serve as the source of all other steroid hormones in the body, including sex hor- mones and corticosteroids. Therefore the function of DHEA seems to lie in supplying the body with what it needs to maintain optimal levels and balance of all the steroid hormones that regulate the body’s activities. Over the past 15 years it has been demonstrated that declining lev- els of DHEA are linked to conditions such as diabetes, obesity, ele- vated cholesterol levels, heart disease, arthritis, and other age-related diseases. In addition, DHEA shows promise in enhancing memory and improving cognitive function.103–105 As of this writing, the only dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled study was a small pilot study (58 sub- jects) in which 50 mg of DHEA was given twice a day. Although some benefit was reported at 3 months, DHEA did not significantly improve cognitive performance or overall ratings of change in severity in this small-scale pilot study.106 The levels of DHEA necessary to improve brainpower in men older than 50 years of age appear to be 25 to 50 mg per day. For women, a dose of 15 to 25 mg appears to be sufficient in most cases. As men and women reach their 70s, they may require higher levels (e.g., 50–100 mg). Excessive dosages of DHEA can cause acne and, in women, menstrual irregularities. Although most elderly people probably need DHEA, laboratory assessment before prescription may help determine whether DHEA would be beneficial in an individual case and to assess the needed doses.

## Melatonin

Formed by the body from serotonin and released by the pineal gland, melatonin is considered by many to be “the master hormone” of the body. It is well known for its use in normalizing circadian rhythms and sleep cycles and as a powerful antioxidant for cancer therapies. Medical research is beginning to value its ostensibly commanding role in many physiological processes. In vitro studies have shown that melatonin protects neuronal cells from heavy metal cobalt damage. Cobalt is a transition metal found in high levels in AD patients. It was found that both the induction of oxidative damage and β -amyloid release were avoided with melatonin treatment. Because cobalt is an essential nutrient, often bound to vita- min B 12 , melatonin may prove to be an important preventive treat- ment in AD-susceptible individuals.107 One double-blind, placebo-controlled study has studied melatonin in AD patients. Researchers from Nippon Medical School, who previ- ously reported on bright light therapy as a means to improve cognitive function in AD, evaluated the effectiveness of melatonin. Three milli- grams of melatonin were given to 11 subjects at 8:30 pm every day for a month, and 9 other subjects were given placebo (mean age of 79.2 years). Based on standard dementia and AD assessment scales, the mel- atonin group had a significantly increased sleeping time and decreased nighttime activity, with improved levels of cognitive and noncognitive functions. Even though the authors noted that these results were signif- icant and clearly supported the use of melatonin in AD, they acknowl- edged that morning bright light therapy showed greater improvements in AD patients.108 A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study investigated the effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep in 80 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine).109 Patients were treated for

2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by placebo for 2 weeks. Patients treated with PRM had significantly better cognitive per- formance, as well as improved sleep efficiency compared with those treated with placebo. The authors concluded that a possible causal link exists between poor sleep and cognitive decline.

## Ginkgo Biloba Extract

Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) standardized to contain 24% ginkgo fla- vonglycosides exerts many effects beneficial in the prevention and early treatment of AD (see Chapter 82). It must be pointed out that GBE should be taken consistently for at least 12 weeks to determine its effectiveness. Although some people experience benefits within a 2- to 3-week period, most will need to take GBE for a longer time to see any significant changes.

## Huperzine A

Huperzine A is an alkaloid isolated from the moss Huperzia serrata, long used in China to treat primarily fever and inflammation. Although it has been shown to have no antipyretic or anti-inflammatory prop- erties in experimental models, Huperzine A is a potent inhibitor of acetyl-cholinesterase. In fact, it is significantly more selective and sub- stantially less toxic than the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors currently used in conventional medicine (e.g., physostigmine, tacrine, and donepezil). Toxicity with synthetic AChE inhibitors has been a major drawback in their clinical use. In contrast, Huperzine A, purified from H. serrata, has been used as a prescription drug in China since the early 1990s and has reportedly been used by more than 100,000 people with no serious adverse effects.110 Huperzine A may be an effective and well-tolerated agent to both suppress seizures and improve cognition in AD by enhancing cholinergic and GABAergic signaling and mitigat- ing AD-related neurotoxicity (Fig. 144.4). Initial clinical studies with Huperzine A conducted in China, which first focused on its use in myasthenia gravis, showed considerable benefit in the treatment of dementia. One double-blind clinical study found that Huperzine A at a dose of 200 mcg twice a day produced measurable improvements in memory, cognitive function, and behav- ioral factors in 58% of AD patients.112 In contrast, 36% in the placebo group showed improvement. In a double-blind study, 210 individuals with AD were random- ized to receive placebo or Huperzine A (200 mcg or 400 mcg twice a day), for at least 16 weeks. Huperzine A 200 mcg twice a day did not influence any change in the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale– cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), but this agent at 400 mcg twice a day showed a 2.27-point improvement in ADAS-Cog at 11 weeks versus a 0.29-point decline in the placebo group and a 1.92-point improve- ment versus a 0.34-point improvement in the placebo arm at week 16. Changes in clinical global impression of change and activities of daily living were not significant at either dose.113

## Bacopa Monniera

Bacopa monniera (BM) is an Ayurvedic botanical medicine used for memory enhancement, epilepsy, insomnia, and as a mild sedative. Additionally, it has been able to reduce memory dysfunction in rat models of AD. One study evaluated an extract of BM on a culture of purified rat astrocytes exposed to toxins mimicking the effect of excess nitric oxide exposure, a condition shown to be a factor in AD. Results showed that the extract of BM inhibited the formation of reactive species and DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. 144.4 Actions of Huperzine A in seizures and cognitive decline.

## Curcuma Longa (Turmeric)

There is considerable experimental evidence that curcumin protects against age-related brain damage and AD in particular. Researchers began exploring this effect after noting that elderly (age 70 to 79) residents of rural India who eat large amounts of turmeric have been shown to have the lowest incidence of AD in the world and 4.4 times lower than that of Americans. In in vitro studies, curcumin has been reported to inhibit amyloid- β -protein (A β ) aggregation, and A β - induced inflammation, as well as the activities of β -secretase and acetyl- cholinesterase. In in vivo studies, oral administration of curcumin has resulted in the inhibition of A β deposition, A β oligomerization, and tau phosphorylation in the brains of AD animal models and improve- ments in behavioral impairment in animal models. Unfortunately, the two clinical trials conducted to date have failed to show any benefit to consuming curcumin.117 However, the failure to produce positive results may have been due to the poor pharmokinetic profile of the curcumin used in the trials. For more information on curcumin, see Chapter 73. Studies in stroke models have also suggested a neuroprotective role of curcumin,9 as well as the ability to reduce plaque burden in models of AD. Curcumin has also been shown to decrease naphtha- lene and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal–induced cataract formation on the lens by decreasing the rate of apoptosis and subsequent opacifica- tion resistance of the lens.65,66 The authors postulate that induction of the glutathione S-transferase, which acts to decrease lipid perox- idation, was probably responsible for the cataractogenesis-inhibit- ing effects.


The primary therapeutic goal is prevention or initiation of therapy as soon as any dementia is noted.

circulation primarily by the spleen. The most common cause of exces- sive destruction of RBCs is abnormal RBC shape. Several processes can lead to increased hemolysis, including: synthesis of defective hemoglo- bin, as seen in hereditary conditions like sickle-cell anemia; mechan- ical injury due to trauma or turbulence within arteries; hereditary RBC enzyme defects; presence of antibodies against surface antigens on RBCs, such as antibodies anti-A or anti-B blood group antigens; chronic disease; and chronic inflammation.

## Deficient Red Blood Cell or Hemoglobin Production

Impaired erythropoiesis (i.e., insufficient production of RBCs or hemoglobin) is the most common category of anemia, and the most common cause is nutritional deficiency. Although deficiency of several vitamins and minerals can produce anemia, the most common include iron, vitamin B 12 , and folic acid. Iron-deficiency anemia is character- ized as a microcytic anemia, whereas folic acid and B 12 deficiency ane- mias are classified as macrocytic.

## Iron-Deficiency Anemia

Iron is critical to human life. Less than 10% of the daily iron uptake of around 20 mg is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa.2 Most of the func- tional iron in the body is present in the heme proteins, such as hemo- globin of red blood cells, where it functions in transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues and the transportation of carbon diox- ide from the tissues to the lungs (Fig. 145.1). The liver contains the sec- ond-highest amount of iron, which is bound to ferritin and hemosiderin as iron storage. Iron is also found in cytochromes, which are involved in mitochondrial electron transfer, in oxygen transport and in the liver Phase I detoxification enzymes. In addition, iron functions in several key enzymes involved with energy production and metabolism including DNA synthesis. Iron deficiency is the most common mineral deficiency in the United States, and iron-deficiency anemia is one of the most common hematological problems worldwide. The groups at highest risk for iron deficiency are infants under 2 years of age, teenage girls, pregnant women, and elderly persons. Studies have found evidence of iron defi- ciency in as high as 30% to 50% of people in these groups. Some degree of iron deficiency occurs in 35% to 58% of young, healthy women. During pregnancy, the number is even higher. Measuring serum ferritin is the best laboratory test for determining body iron stores.3 However, it must be pointed out that iron deficiency occurs in many stages, and anemia is the last stage of iron deficiency. Iron-dependent enzymes involved in energy production and metabo- lism are the first to be affected by low iron levels. Patients with a serum ferritin level less than 25 ng/mL have a very high probability of being iron deficient, whereas serum ferritin values greater than 100 ng/mL are associated with a very low likelihood of iron-deficiency anemia.4 Investigating total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin satura- tion, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be help- ful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (Fig. 145.2); bone-marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a defin- itive diagnosis.5 A trial of iron is a reasonable approach in children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age if the review of symp- toms, history, and physical examination are negative for other causes. However, if there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10–20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in a reasonable amount of time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. Iron deficiency may be caused by an increased iron requirement, decreased dietary intake, diminished iron absorption or utilization, blood loss, or a combination of these factors. Increased requirements for iron occur during the growth spurts of infancy and adolescence as well as during pregnancy and lactation. Most pregnant women are routinely given iron supplements during their pregnancy, as the dra- matically increased need for iron during pregnancy cannot usually be met through diet alone. Inadequate intake of iron is common in many parts of the world, especially in areas where people consume primarily a vegetarian diet. Many standard infant diets in developed countries (high in milk and cereals) are also low in iron. The adolescent who con- sumes a “standard American diet” is at high risk for iron deficiency. However, the population at greatest risk of dietary iron deficiency is the low-income elderly population; this deficiency is enhanced by impaired iron absorption resulting from decreased hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach—a common complication in the elderly population. Other causes of decreased absorption in the general population include chronic diarrhea or malabsorption, the surgical removal of the stomach, and antacid or acid-blocking drug use.

common cause of iron deficiency in women of childbearing age, often due to excessive menstrual bleeding. Interestingly, iron deficiency is a common cause of excessive menstrual blood loss, which can create a cycle of cause and effect.6,7 Other common causes of blood loss include blood donation and bleeding from peptic ulcers and hemorrhoids. The negative effects of iron deficiency are due largely to the impaired delivery of oxygen to the tissues and the impaired activity of iron-containing enzymes in various tissues. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, excessive menstrual blood loss, learning disabilities, and impaired immune function, as well as decreased energy levels, detox- ification function, and physical performance. Even mild iron-de- ficiency anemia leads to a reduction in physical work capacity and productivity. Supplementation with iron has produced rapid improvements in work capacity among iron-deficient individuals. A systematic review of animal and human studies evaluated the causal relation- ship between iron deficiency and physical work capacity.8 Iron defi- ciency was examined along a continuum from severe iron-deficiency anemia (SIDA) to moderate iron-deficiency anemia (MIDA) to iron deficiency without anemia (IDNA). Results demonstrated a strong causal effect of SIDA and MIDA on aerobic capacity in animals and humans, likely a result of reduced oxygen transport associated with anemia. In addition, tissue iron deficiency may play a role through reduced cellular oxidative capacity. The review concluded that ener- getic efficiency was affected at all levels of iron deficiency in humans, with the reduced work productivity observed in field studies likely due to anemia and reduced oxygen transport. However, impaired physical performance due to iron deficiency is not dependent on anemia because the iron-dependent enzymes involved in energy production and metabolism will be impaired long before anemia occurs.

## Vitamin B

## –Deficiency Anemia

Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) deficiency is most often due to a defect in absorption or cobalamin metabolism rather than a dietary lack of the vitamin. For vitamin B 12 from food to be absorbed, it must be liberated by hydrochloric acid and bound to intrinsic factor. The B 12 -intrinsic factor complex is absorbed in the small intestine with the aid of the pancreatic enzyme trypsin. Intrinsic factor is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. These cells are responsible for the secretion of hydrochloric acid. Hence, the secretion of intrinsic factor parallels that of hydrochloric acid. Pernicious anemia (PA) is a consequence of intrinsic factor loss and neutralizing intrinsic factor antibody that impairs cobalamin absorp- tion. The defect is rare before the age of 35. Use of the Schilling test for detection of PA has been mostly supplanted by serological testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Although PA has been reported in virtually every ethnic group, it is more common in indi- viduals of Scandinavian, English, and Irish descent. The loss of hydro- chloric acid leads to iron-deficiency anemia, which often precedes cobalamin-deficient pernicious anemia by 20 years. A dietary lack of vitamin B 12 is most often associated with a strict vegetarian or vegan diet. Unlike other water-soluble nutrients, vita- min B 12 is stored in the liver, kidney, and other body tissues. Because normal body stores of vitamin B 12 may last an individual 3 to 6 years, signs and symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency arise after years of low dietary intake or inadequate secretion of intrinsic factor. In addition, it appears that a deficiency of vitamin B 12 also affects the brain and nervous system before the development of pernicious anemia. In other words, waiting for a finding of anemia to diagnose a vitamin B 12 defi- ciency may result in significant patient harm.

red, and swollen tongue. Common nervous system symptoms include numbness and tingling of the arms or legs, depression, mental confu- sion, loss of vibration sense, and loss of deep tendon reflexes. In elderly persons, a vitamin B 12 deficiency can mimic Alzheimer’s disease. The presence of macrocytosis and characteristic symptoms pro- vide the physician with important clues suggesting B 12 deficiency. Deficiency of cobalamin, whether nutritional or the result of inborn errors of vitamin B 12 metabolism, inactivate methionine synthase and mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, leading to the accumu- lation of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (Fig. 145.3). Thus homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) are the preferred serum biomarkers used to determine B 12 status. Stand-alone serum levels of vitamin B 12 have limited diagnostic value because low serum levels of vitamin B 12 do not always represent deficiency, and likewise, severe functional deficiency of the micronutrient has been documented in the presence of normal and even high levels of serum vitamin B 12 .9

# FOLATE DEFICIENCY

Folate (or folic acid) deficiency is one of the most common vitamin deficiencies in the world. Unlike vitamin B 12 , the body does not accu- mulate a surplus of folate, storing only enough to sustain the body for 1 to 2 months. Folate deficiency is extremely common among alcoholics, as alco- hol consumption impairs folate absorption, disrupts folate metabo- lism, and causes the body to excrete folate. Folic acid deficiency is also common among pregnant women, resulting from an increased demand. Folate is vital to cell reproduction in the fetus, and a defi- ciency of folate during development presents an increased risk for the development of birth defects such as neural tube defects. The lower- ing of folic acid levels by alcohol during pregnancy further increases the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome and/or neural tube defects. In addition to alcohol, several pharmaceuticals can induce a folate deficiency, including anticancer drugs, drugs for epilepsy, and oral contraceptives. Folic acid deficiency is also common among patients who have chronic diarrhea or malabsorption states such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, or tropical sprue. Because a deficiency of folate will result in diarrhea and malabsorption, often a vicious circle ensues. The administration of the active form of folate (5-methyltetrahydrofolate) as a preventive measure is warranted in anyone experiencing chronic diarrhea. Often this has a therapeutic effect as well. Folate deficiency will result in macrocytic anemia similar to that caused by a vitamin B 12 deficiency. The most sensitive test to assess folic acid deficiency is determining the folate content of the serum and RBC. The reference range for serum folate is 2.5 to 20 ng/mL. In addi- tion to anemia, other symptoms of folic acid deficiency include fatigue, pallor, headaches, palpitations, diarrhea, depression, and a swollen, red tongue. Note: It is always necessary to supplement vitamin B 12 along with 5-MTHF to prevent the folate supplement from masking a vitamin B 12 deficiency. Supplementing with 5-MTHF will correct the anemia of a vitamin B 12 deficiency, but it cannot overcome the problems that vitamin B 12 deficiency causes in the brain. Also, a high level of folate will aggravate the problems caused by vitamin B 12 deficiency.

# BONE MARROW AND STEM CELL DYSFUNCTION

Bone marrow and stem cell problems may prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells. If stem cells are too few, defective, or replaced by other cells such as metastatic cancer cells, anemia may result. Anemias resulting from bone marrow or stem cell problems include the following.

## Aplastic Anemia

Aplastic anemia is a hematological disease characterized by hemato- poietic failure of the bone marrow, resulting in a marked reduction in the number of stem cells or the absence of stem cells. It can be inher- ited, can occur without apparent cause, or can occur when the bone marrow is injured by medications, radiation, environmental toxins, chemotherapy, autoimmune disorders, or infection. Aplastic anemia can be either severe or not severe, and it may occur abruptly or may develop slowly and worsen over time.

## Inherited Hemoglobin Disorders

Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are the most common inherited monogenic diseases worldwide characterized by deformed and/or inadequate hemoglobin. This inadequacy results in immature and deformed red blood cells and a decrease in oxygen transport. Several clinical forms of α -thalassemia and β -thalassemia have been described, and severity can range from mild to life threatening. Blood analyses of almost all thalassemias show a reduction in the size and Hb content of mature RBCs, which is evident by a reduced MCV (less than 80 fem- toliters/cell) and mean cell MCH (less than 27 picograms/cell) (Fig. 145.4). The most severe form is called Cooley’s anemia. Sickle cell anemia occurs in individuals who are homozygous for a single-nucleotide substitution of the beta-globin gene, often pro- ducing a rigid, sicklelike shape of the red blood cells. Several subtypes exist depending on the exact mutation, with clinical manifestations including chronic hemolysis, increased susceptibility to infections, and vaso-occlusive complications.10 Individuals with a single abnor- mal copy of the gene often do not have symptoms and are classified as carriers.

## Lead Toxicity

Lead is a persistent toxic metal. At least 50% of all lead is stored in the bones, where it has a half-life of years to decades. Lead is read- ily absorbed through both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Gastrointestinal absorption of lead in children can be up to five times greater than in adults who are exposed to the same sources. Once absorbed, lead is bound to the red blood cells and moved into soft tissue and bones, with some excretion via the urine. Chronic, low-level lead exposure is associated with several adverse health conditions. In persons with blood lead levels (BLLs) higher than μ g/dL, the heme enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) is inhibited, leading to anemia.


Anemia cannot be reliably diagnosed by clinical presentation. Fatigue, the most common presenting symptom, is caused by anemia in approx- imately 1 out of 52 patients in primary care practice.11 It is imperative that a comprehensive laboratory analysis of the blood be performed. Fig. 145.5 provides a flow chart of suggested labs as well as potential diagnoses.

## 1105CHAPTER 145 Anemia


Treatment of anemia is dependent on proper clinical evaluation to determine the origin of the anemia. It is critical that the underlying cause of the anemia be uncovered if the correct therapy is to be employed.

# GENERAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT FOR ALL TYPES

Increasing iron levels in food may help partially or completely over- come poor iron absorption. Animal proteins are a rich source of heme iron, and dark green leafy vegetables are among the best sources of nonheme iron. Although many individuals shy away from organ meats, liver is an excellent source of iron as well as B vitamins. Lamb and venison also contain significant levels of iron and are leaner and less inflammatory than beef. In addition to iron, green leafy vegetables contain natural fat-soluble chlorophyll and nutrients such as vitamin C and folic acid. The chloro- phyll molecule is similar to the hemoglobin molecule. Fat-soluble (but not water-soluble) chlorophyll products may be beneficial. However, water-soluble chlorophyll is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and therefore has no use in the treatment of anemia. Because a large percentage of individuals with anemia do not secrete enough hydrochloric acid, it is often important for them to take hydro- chloric acid supplements with meals. See Chapter 123, Digestive Support.

## Iron-Deficiency Anemia

In iron-deficiency anemia, it is essential to determine the reason for the loss of iron (e.g., chronic blood loss) or the reason for the poor absorption of dietary iron (e.g., low vitamin C or high tannins in diet). Lack of hydrochloric acid is a common reason for impaired iron absorption, especially among elderly persons. There are two forms of dietary iron: heme iron and nonheme iron. Heme iron is bound to the oxygen-binding proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. Heme iron is the most efficiently absorbed form of iron. The absorption rate of nonheme iron supplements, such as ferrous sul- fate and ferrous fumarate, is 2.9% on an empty stomach and 0.9% with food. This rate is significantly less than the absorption rate of heme iron, which is as high as 35%. In addition, heme iron does not cause the side effects associated with nonheme sources of iron, such as nau- sea, flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea. Despite the superiority of heme iron, nonheme iron salts are the most popular iron supplements. Although heme iron is better absorbed, dosing higher quantities of nonheme iron salts results in similar net absorption amounts (i.e., 3 mg of heme iron and 50 mg of nonheme iron will net approximately the same level of absorption). In adults with iron deficiency anemia, treatment involves the use of 50 to 150 mg elemental iron daily in divided doses. The usual rec- ommendation for any nonheme source is generally up to 60 mg daily in divided doses. For children with iron-deficiency anemia, the dose is 4 to 6 mg/kg per day divided into three doses. High intakes of other minerals, particularly calcium, magnesium, and zinc, can interfere with iron absorption. Therefore, when treating iron deficiency, it is recommended to take iron away from these minerals. In contrast, vita- min C enhances iron absorption. Ferrous sulfate is the most popular iron supplement, but it is cer- tainly less than ideal, because it often causes constipation or other DAT = direct antiglobulin test (direct Coombs' test): LFT = liver function tests; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase; MCV = mean corpuscular volume; TIBC = total iron-binding capacity; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.

gastrointestinal disturbance. The best forms of nonheme iron are ferrous succinate, glycinate, fumarate, and pyrophosphate. Of these, the preferred form is micronized ferrous pyrophosphate, which is then microencapsulated to allow it to be dispersed and assimilated. Advantages of this form include stability, lack of taste or flavor, and lack of gastrointestinal side effects. In addition, ferrous pyrophos- phate provides a sustained-release form of iron (up to 12 hours) with a high relative bioavailability, especially when taken on an empty stomach.12 The best dietary source of iron is red meat, as well as liver and fish. Nonmeat sources of iron include beans, molasses, dried fruits, whole- grain and enriched breads, and green leafy vegetables. Nonheme iron absorption is enhanced by vitamin C. Table 145.1 provides the iron content per serving of some food sources of iron. The table does not factor in absorption. For example, the absorption rate for calf’s liver is nearly 30%, whereas the absorp- tion rate for the vegetable sources is approximately 5%. The daily dietary recommended allowance for iron depends on an individual’s age and gender (Table 145.2). Several foods and beverages contain substances that inhibit iron absorption, including tea, coffee, wheat bran, and egg yolk. Antacids and overuse of calcium supplements also decrease iron absorption. These items should be restricted in the diet of individuals who have iron deficiency. Iron supplements can decrease the availability of several medications, including levodopa and levothyroxine, and care should be exercised when simultaneous administration of these sub- stances is indicated.

## Cautions and Warnings

Keep all iron supplements out of the reach of children. Acute iron poi- soning in infants can result in serious consequences. Severe iron poi- soning is characterized by damage to the intestinal lining, liver failure, nausea and vomiting, and shock.

## Pernicious Anemia

The usual dietary sources of vitamin B 12 are animal-derived foods. The richest sources are liver and kidney, followed by eggs, fish, cheese, and meat. Strict vegetarians and vegans have an increased risk of B 12 defi- ciency, and therefore it is necessary to identify plant-derived foods that contain high levels of vitamin B 12 —produced by the bacteria, typically in some kind of fermented form. A survey of naturally occurring and high vitamin B 12 -containing plant-derived food sources showed that nori is a good vitamin B 12 source for vegetarians.13 Consumption of approximately 4 g of dried nori (vitamin B 12 content: 77.6 μ g/100 g dry weight) supplies the RDA of 2.4 μ g per day. Vitamin B 12 is available in several forms. The most common form is cyanocobalamin. However, vitamin B 12 is active in only two forms: methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Both forms are available commercially in tablet form in the United States. Although methylcobalamin is active immediately upon absorp- tion, cyanocobalamin must be converted by the body to either methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin by removing the cya- nide molecule and adding either a methyl or adenosyl group. Cyanocobalamin is not active in many experimental models, whereas both methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin demon- strate high-level activity. Medical treatment involves injecting vitamin B 12 at a dose of 1 mg daily for 1 week, until the anemia has resolved. Preventive injections may also be required to prevent deficiency in the future. Oral therapy has been shown to be equally effective.

## Oral Versus Injectable B


Although it is popular to inject vitamin B 12 , injection is not strictly necessary. Studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B 12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B 12 deficiency state, even in the absence of intrinsic factor. In the United States, oral vitamin B 12 ther- apy is rarely used even though it has been shown to be 100% effective in the long-term treatment of pernicious anemia.14 Soon after vitamin B 12 was isolated in 1948, it was introduced in an injectable form, and researchers busily sought an oral alternative. Oral preparations containing intrinsic factor were tried, but some patients developed antibodies against intrinsic factor and therefore would not respond. Studies in the 1950s and 1960s documented that a small but constant proportion of an oral dose of cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 300 mcg to 1000 mcg daily was absorbed even without intrinsic factor through the process of diffusion. Thus by sufficiently increasing the dose, adequate absorption could be attained. A study in 1978 described 64 Swedish patients with pernicious anemia and other vitamin B 12 - deficiency states who were treated with 1000 mcg of oral cyanocobal- amin daily.15 Complete normalization of serum levels and liver stores for vitamin B 12 , as well as full clinical remission, was observed in all patients studied over a 3-year period. Since then, several studies have validated the use of oral vitamin B 12 in the treatment of pernicious anemia.16

## 1107CHAPTER 145 Anemia

Despite the research, the use of oral vitamin B 12 therapy remains uncommon in the United States. In a survey of internists, 91% erro- neously believed that vitamin B 12 could not be absorbed in sufficient quantities without intrinsic factor.17 Interestingly, 88% of these sur- veyed doctors also stated that an effective oral vitamin B 12 therapy would be useful in their practice and further stated that it would be their preferred method of delivery if it were effective. Studies estab- lished that the average absorption rate of oral cyanocobalamin by patients with pernicious anemia is 1.2% across a wide range of dos- ages. Because the daily turnover rate is about 2 mcg, an oral dosage of 200 to 250 mcg daily results in an average absorption of 2.4 to mcg, respectively, which may be adequate for most patients. However, higher doses are often prescribed to ensure effective treatment. In the treatment of pernicious anemia, the usual intramuscu- lar (IM) dosage recommended by most medical texts is 1000 mcg IM weekly for 8 weeks, then once a month for life. For oral vitamin B 12 , the recommended dosage is 2000 mcg daily (14,000 mcg weekly) for at least 1 month, followed by a daily intake of 1000 mcg of vita- min B 12 . Methylcobalamin, the active form of B 12 , is preferred over cyanocobalamin.

## Folic Acid–Deficiency Anemia

Dietary foods high in folic acid include liver, asparagus, dried beans, brewer’s yeast, dark green leafy vegetables, and whole grains. Because folic acid is destroyed by heat and light, fruits and vegetables should be eaten fresh or with very little cooking. To replenish folic acid stores, 800 to 1000 mcg of active folate should be taken every day for up to 1 month. Folic acid is available as folic acid (folate) and folinic acid (5-methyl-tetra-hydrofolate). To utilize folic acid, the body must first convert it to tetrahydrofolate and then add a methyl group to form methyl-tetrahydrofolate (folinic acid). Methyl-tetrahydrofolate is the most active form of folic acid and has been shown to be more efficient at raising body stores than folic acid.18 Supplying the body with methyl-tetrahydrofolate bypasses these steps and is needed for those with a genetic inability to make the conversion.


<!-- chunk -->

## General Recommendations

Effective therapy for anemia is dependent on proper classification as to its cause. Blood tests should be performed every 1 to 2 months to determine the efficacy of treatment.


Perhaps the best food for individuals with anemia is calf’s liver. Ingestion of 4 to 6 oz of calf’s liver 3 times per week is an option. In addition, the liberal consumption of green leafy vegetables is recommended.

## 1110SECTION 6 Diseases

This accumulation makes the heart extremely susceptible to cellular damage, which ultimately leads to a heart attack. Carnitine, pantethine, and coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ) are essential compounds in normal fat and energy metabolism and are of extreme benefit to sufferers of angina. These nutrients prevent the accumula- tion of fatty acids within the heart muscle by improving the conversion of fatty acids and other compounds into energy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutritional Supplements for Angina

The use of antioxidant supplementation in patients with angina is important. In an analysis of normal controls and patients with either stable or unstable angina, the plasma level of antioxidants has been shown to be a more sensitive predictor of unstable angina than the severity of atherosclerosis.2,3 One group of researchers concluded: “These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of antioxidants in coronary artery disease (CAD) may result, in part, by an influence on lesion activity rather than a reduction in the overall extent of fixed disease.”2 Antioxidant nutrients are also important in preventing nitrate tol- erance. Oral nitrates are widely used in the conventional treatment of angina, but their continuous administration can result in the rapid development of tolerance. Experimental findings indicate that nitrate tolerance is associated with increased vascular production of super- oxide. The superoxide anions generated quickly degrade the nitric oxide formed from the administration of nitroglycerin and result in lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (an important intra- cellular regulator that promotes vasorelaxation). Because vitamin C is the main aqueous-phase antioxidant and free radical scavenger of superoxide and vitamin E is the main lipid-phase antioxidant, their importance in preventing nitrate tolerance is obvious. Clinical trials have upheld this connection, showing that high-dose supplementation of vitamins C and E can prevent nitrate tolerance.4,5

## Carnitine

Carnitine, a vitamin-like compound, stimulates the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids by the energy-producing units in cells—the mito- chondria. Carnitine is essential in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria. A deficiency in carnitine results in a decrease in fatty-acid concentrations in the mitochondria and reduced energy production. Normal heart function is critically dependent on adequate concen- trations of carnitine. Although the normal heart stores more carnitine than it needs, if the heart does not have a good supply of oxygen, car- nitine levels quickly decrease. This decrease leads to decreased energy production in the heart and increased risk for angina and heart disease. Because angina patients have a decreased supply of oxygen, carnitine supplementation makes good sense. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that carnitine improves angina and heart disease.6-10 Supplementation with carnitine normal- izes heart carnitine levels and allows the heart muscle to use its limited oxygen supply more efficiently. This increased efficiency translates to an improvement in cases of angina. Improvements have been noted in exercise tolerance and heart function and suggest that carnitine is an effective alternative to drugs in cases of angina. In one study of patients with stable angina, oral administration of mg of l-carnitine increased mean exercise time and the time necessary for abnormalities to occur on a stress test (6.4 minutes in the placebo group compared with 8.8 minutes in the carnitine-treated group).10 These results indicate that carnitine may be an effective alternative to other antianginal agents such as beta blockers, calcium channel antagonists, and nitrates, especially in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Carnitine, by improving fatty-acid utilization and energy production in the heart muscle, may also prevent the production of toxic fatty-acid metabolites. These compounds are extremely deleterious because they activate various phospholipases and disrupt cellular membrane struc- tures. The changes in the properties of cardiac cell membranes induced by fatty-acid metabolites are thought to contribute to impaired heart muscle contractility and compliance, increased susceptibility to irregular beats, and the eventual death of heart tissue. Supplemental carnitine increases heart carnitine levels and prevents the production of toxic fatty-acid metabolites. This mechanism has been demonstrated clinically, where the early administration of l-carnitine (40 mg/kg per day) in patients having heart attacks was found to considerably reduce heart damage.11

## Pantethine

Pantethine is the stable form of pantetheine, the active form of pan- tothenic acid, which is the fundamental component of coenzyme A (CoA). CoA is involved in the transport of fatty acids to and from cells as well as to the mitochondria. The synthetic pathway from pantethine to CoA is much shorter than that of pantothenic acid, making panteth- eine the preferred therapeutic substance. In addition, pantetheine has significant lipid-lowering activity, whereas pantothenic acid has very little if any effect in lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The standard dose for pantethine is 900 mg per day. Like car- nitine, pantethine has been shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and to increase high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels.12-14 Its lipid-lowering effects are most impressive when its toxicity (virtually none) is com- pared with that of conventional lipid-lowering drugs. Its mechanism of action is due to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and acceler- ation of fatty acid breakdown in the mitochondria. Pantethine is well indicated in angina. Like carnitine, heart pan- tethine levels decrease during times of reduced oxygen supply. Demonstrated effects in animals indicate that it would greatly benefit individuals with angina.15

## Coenzyme Q

<!-- chunk -->

## 10

CoQ 10 , also known as ubiquinone, is an essential component of the mito- chondria, where it plays a major role in energy production. Like carni- tine and pantethine, CoQ 10 can be synthesized in the body. Nonetheless, deficiency states have been reported. Deficiency can be a result of impaired CoQ 10 synthesis due to nutritional deficiencies, a genetic or acquired defect in CoQ 10 synthesis, or increased tissue needs.16 Cardiovascular diseases—including angina, hypertension, mitral valve prolapse, and congestive heart failure—are examples of dis- eases that require increased tissue levels of CoQ 10 .16 In addition, many elderly persons may have increased CoQ 10 requirements; the decline of CoQ 10 levels that occurs with age may be partly responsible for the age-related deterioration of the immune system. CoQ 10 deficiency is common in individuals with heart disease. Heart tissue biopsies in patients with various heart diseases show a CoQ 10 deficiency in 50% to 75% of cases.16 One of the most metaboli- cally active tissues in the body, the heart may be unusually susceptible to the effects of CoQ 10 deficiency. Accordingly, CoQ 10 has shown great promise in the treatment of heart disease. In one study, 12 patients with stable angina pectoris were treated with CoQ 10 (150 mg per day for 4 weeks) in a double-blind crossover trial.17 In comparison with placebo, CoQ 10 reduced the frequency of anginal attacks by 53%. In addition, researchers found a significant increase in treadmill exercise–tolerance (time to onset of chest pain and time to development of ECG abnormalities) during CoQ 10 treat- ment. The results of this study and others suggest that CoQ 10 is a safe and effective treatment for angina pectoris. Carnitine, pantethine, and CoQ 10 should be considered in all heart disorders, not just angina.

## 1111CHAPTER 146 Angina


Magnesium deficiency may play a major role in angina, including Prinzmetal’s variant. A magnesium deficiency has been shown to pro- duce spasms of the coronary arteries and is thought to be a cause of nonocclusive heart attacks.18 Furthermore, researchers have observed that men who die suddenly of heart attacks have significantly lower levels of heart magnesium, as well as potassium, compared to matched controls.19 Making magnesium the treatment of choice for angina due to coro- nary artery spasm has been suggested.19-21 Magnesium administration has also been found to be helpful in the management of arrhythmias and in angina due to atherosclerosis. Its benefit in these situations is presumably via the same mechanisms responsible for its effects in an acute MI. Since the mid-1980s, eight well-designed studies involving more than 4000 patients have demonstrated that intravenous magnesium supplementation during the first hour of admission to a hospital for an acute MI produces a favorable effect in reducing immediate and long- term complications as well as death rates.22-24 The beneficial effects of magnesium in acute MI relate to its ability to: • Improve energy production within the heart • Dilate the coronary arteries, resulting in improved delivery of oxygen to the heart • Reduce peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in reduced demand on the heart • Inhibit platelets from aggregating and forming blood clots • Reduce the size of the infarct (blockage) • Improve heart rate and arrhythmias

## Arginine

Arginine supplementation has been shown to be beneficial in sev- eral cardiovascular diseases, including angina pectoris. Its benefit is thought to occur via increasing nitric oxide levels, thereby improv- ing blood flow, reducing thrombosis, and improving rheology. The degree of improvement offered by arginine supplementation in angina and other cardiovascular diseases can be quite significant as a result of improved nitric oxide levels. In double-blind studies, it has been shown to be especially effective in increasing exercise tolerance. Typical dosage is 6 g per day in divided dosages.25-27 In a short-term study, arginine supplementation of 3 g per day for 15 days resulted in increased activity of the free-radical scavenging enzyme superox- ide dismutase and increased the levels of total thiols and ascorbic acid, with a concomitant decrease in lipid peroxidation, carbonyl content, serum cholesterol, and the activity of the prooxidant enzyme xanthine oxidase.28 These beneficial changes point to additional mechanisms for the use of arginine in angina and cardiac ischemia. Use of arginine is cautioned by a report in one study in survivors of MI in whom sup- plementation with arginine (9 g per day for 6 months) was associated with an increase in mortality compared with the placebo group (8.6% vs. 0%).29 This effect may have been an aberration or due to the use of higher dosages of arginine.

## Crataegus Species

Hawthorn berry and extracts of the flowering tops are widely used in Europe for their cardiovascular activity. They exhibit a combination of effects that are of great value to patients with angina and other heart problems. Numerous experiments and clinical studies have docu- mented the cardiovascular efficacy of the plant through various mech- anisms, including positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects; escalation in coronary blood flow and exercise tolerance; inhibition of the enzymes, such as angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) and phos- phodiesterase; providing anti-inflammatory and antihyperlipidemic effects; and improving status of antioxidant enzymes, which support its cardioactive efficacy.30 Studies have demonstrated that hawthorn extracts are effective in reducing anginal attacks as well as in lowering blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels.31-33 The beneficial effects in the treatment of angina are due to improve- ment in the blood and oxygen supply of the heart resulting from dila- tion of the coronary vessels, as well as improvement of the metabolic processes in the heart.31-35 The ability of Crataegus species to dilate coronary blood vessels has been repeatedly demonstrated in experimental studies.31-33 In addi- tion, Crataegus extracts have been shown to improve cardiac energy metabolism in human and experimental studies. This combined effect is extremely important in the treatment of angina because it results in improved myocardial function with more efficient use of oxygen. This improvement results not only from increased blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle but also from hawthorn flavonoids interacting with key enzymes to enhance myocardial contractility. Because adhesion molecules play an important role in the devel- opment and progression of coronary atherosclerosis, one study eval- uated the effect of Cratagol herbal tablets, aerobic exercise, and their combination on the serum levels of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 and E-Selectin in patients with stable angina pectoris.34 Eighty stable angina pectoris patients age 45 to 65 years were randomly divided into four groups including three experimental groups and one control group: aerobic exercise (E), C. oxyacantha extract (S), aerobic exercise and C. oxyacantha extract (S+E), and control (C). After weeks of treatment, intergroup comparison of the data revealed a sig- nificant reduction (P < 0.01) in serum levels of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in experimental groups. The authors concluded that aerobic exercise and consuming C. oxyacantha extract present an effective comple- mentary strategy to significantly lower the risk of atherosclerosis and heart problems. (See Chapter 71 for a comprehensive discussion of this important botanical.)

## Ammi visnaga

Khella is a medicinal plant native to the Mediterranean region, where it has been used in the treatment of angina and other heart ailments since the time of the pharaohs. Several of its components have demon- strated the ability to dilate the coronary arteries. Its mechanism of action appears to be similar to that of the calcium channel blocking drugs. Since the late 1940s, there have been numerous scientific stud- ies on the clinical effect of khella extracts in the treatment of angina. More specifically, khellin, a derivative of the plant, was shown to be extremely effective in relieving anginal symptoms, improving exercise tolerance, and normalizing ECGs. This finding is evident by the con- cluding statements in a study by Osher and colleagues35 in 1951: “The high proportion of favorable results, together with the striking degree of improvement frequently observed, has led us to the conclusion that khellin, properly used, is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of angina pectoris.” At higher doses (120–150 mg per day), pure khellin was associ- ated with mild side effects, such as anorexia, nausea, and dizziness. Although most clinical studies used high dosages, several studies show that as little as 30 mg per day appears to offer as good results with fewer side effects.36,37 Rather than using the isolated compound khellin, khella extracts standardized for khellin content (typically 12%) are the preferred form. A daily dose of such an extract would be 250 to 300 mg. Khella appears to work well with hawthorn extracts.

## Relaxation and Breathing Exercises

Relaxation and breathing exercises may be helpful in improving angi- nal symptoms, especially when anxiety is a significant contributor.42,43 In one study in patients with cardiac syndrome X, a form of angina in people with otherwise normal coronary arteries, transcendental med- itation (20 minutes twice daily of silently chanting a mantra with eyes closed) was found to reduce angina-like chest pain and to normalize ECGs.42

## Chelation Therapy

EDTA chelation therapy is an alternative to coronary artery bypass sur- gery and angioplasty, which may prove to be more effective, safer, and less expensive. EDTA is an amino acid–like molecule that, when slowly infused into the bloodstream, binds with minerals such as calcium, iron, copper, and lead and carries them to the kidneys, where they are excreted. EDTA chelation has been commonly used for lead poisoning, but in the late 1950s and early 1960s it was found to help patients with atherosclerosis. The discovery of EDTA chelation therapy in the treatment of angina and other conditions associated with atherosclerosis happened accidentally. In 1956 a battery worker whom Norman Clarke was treat- ing with EDTA for lead poisoning noticed that his symptoms of angina disappeared. Clarke and others began using EDTA chelation therapy in patients with angina, cerebral vascular insufficiency, and occlusive peripheral vascular disease. In a series of 283 patients treated by Clarke and colleagues from 1956 to 1960, a total of 87% showed improvements in their symptoms. Heart patients improved, and patients with blocked arteries in the legs, particularly those with diabetes, avoided amputation.44,45 It was originally thought that EDTA opened blocked arteries by chelating out the calcium deposits in the cholesterol plaque. However, the benefit now seems more related to chelating out excess iron and copper, minerals that, in the presence of oxygen, stimulate free radi- cals. Free radicals damage arterial cells, and this damage is a primary cause of atherosclerosis. In a review of the progression and regression of atherosclerosis, the authors write that the process of atherosclerosis is “dependent on the presence of some metals (copper and iron) and can be completely inhibited by chelating agents such as EDTA.”46 Despite obvious benefits to heart patients, EDTA fell out of favor in the mid-1960s. Advocates believe this occurred for two reasons: (1) the lucrative surgical approach to heart and vessel disease was on the rise; and (2) the patent on EDTA that was held by Abbott Laboratories expired, so there was no financial interest for drug companies to fund research. Fortunately, in 1972 a small group of practicing physicians using EDTA chelation therapy founded an organization now called the American College for the Advancement of Medicine to continue edu- cation and research in this important area. In the early days of EDTA chelation therapy, several serious prob- lems were discovered. Giving too much EDTA or giving it too fast was soon noted to be dangerous. In fact, several deaths attributed to kid- ney failure were caused by toxicity to EDTA. Fortunately, additional research resulted in more appropriate protocols, and EDTA chelation therapy is now safe. No deaths or significant adverse reactions have occurred in more than 500,000 patients who have undergone EDTA chelation therapy. Because EDTA chelation improves blood flow throughout the body, the “side effects” are usually beneficial and only a few adverse effects are noticed. A substantial body of scientific evidence exists on the use of EDTA chelation therapy in the treatment of angina, peripheral vascular dis- ease, and cerebral vascular disease.47-51 Nonetheless, there is a paucity of well-designed placebo-controlled studies to definitively assess the efficacy of this approach. This short- coming is unfortunate considering the early successes. The conclusion from a Cochrane Review summarizes the situation well: “At present, there is insufficient evidence to decide on the effectiveness or ineffec- tiveness of chelation therapy in improving clinical outcomes of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.” For more information, refer to the American College of Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), 23121 Verdugo Drive, Suite 204, Laguna Hills, CA, 92653; 1-800- 532-3688 (outside California) or 1-800-435-6199 (inside California); www.acam.org.


The primary therapy for angina is prevention, because angina is usu- ally secondary to atherosclerosis. Once angina has developed, restoring proper blood supply to the heart and enhancing energy production within the heart are necessary. Particularly important nutrients for accomplishing these results are vitamins C and E, carnitine, pan- tethine, CoQ 10 , magnesium, and arginine. Magnesium is of additional benefit because of its ability to relax spastic coronary arteries and improve heart function. Hawthorn berries or extracts offer several benefits to individuals with angina, including coronary artery dilation and improved heart muscle metabolism. Patients with unstable angina pectoris (characterized by a progres- sive increase in the frequency and severity of pain, increased sensitivity to precipitating factors, progression of symptoms over several days, and prolonged coronary pain) should be hospitalized.


The dietary guidelines given in Chapter 44 are appropriate here. An increase of dietary fiber is recommended, especially the gel-forming or mucilaginous fibers (e.g., flaxseed, oat bran, pectin). Onions and garlic (both raw and cooked), vegetables, and fish should also be increased, and the consumption of saturated fats, cholesterol, sugar, and animal proteins should be reduced. All fried foods and food allergens should be avoided. Patients with reactive hypoglycemia should eat regu- lar meals and carefully avoid simple carbohydrates in all forms (e.g., sugar, honey, dried fruit, and fruit juice).

## Lifestyle

The individual with angina should not smoke or drink alcohol or cof- fee. Stress should be decreased by using stress management techniques such as progressive relaxation, meditation, or guided imagery. A care- fully graded progressive aerobic exercise program (30 minutes three times a week) is a necessity. Walking is a good exercise with which to start.

## 1115CHAPTER 147 Aphthous Stomatitis

Furthermore, immunoglobulin E–bearing lymphocytes are signifi- cantly increased in aphthous lesions, and mast cells are increased in tissue sections from prodromal stages of recurrent ulcers.11 Mast cell degranulation plays an important role in the production of the aph- thous lesion.12 An elimination diet has been shown to have good ther- apeutic results.13 The allergen is not necessarily a food. Additional allergens inducing RAU are14: • Benzoic acid • Cinnamaldehyde • Nickel • Parabens • Dichromate • Sorbic acid Elimination of allergens usually brings significant improvement and in many cases complete resolution.15 Local, chemical, or physical trauma often initiates aphthae in susceptible individuals (pathergy). Conclusive evidence is lacking to support the role of an infectious etiology, including herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and Helicobacter pylori.16,17 Approximately 66% of HIV-positive individ- uals have herpetiform ulcers and RAUs, which must be differentiated from those caused by antiretroviral medications and bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.18 RAU can result from a T cell–mediated response to antigens of Streptococcus sanguis that cross-react with heat-shock proteins. One controlled study has shown a statistically significant increase in RAU in subjects taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).19 Oral hygiene products, chewing gum, candy, acidic foods, and walnuts have been associated with RAU. The avoidance of toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulfate may be helpful.20,21 Two studies of traditional Chinese herbal formulas added to toothpastes have shown significant benefit for RAU patients.22,23

## Gluten Sensitivity

Considerable evidence indicates that sensitivity to gluten is associ- ated with RAU. The incidence of RAU is increased in patients with celiac disease.24-27 Jejunal biopsy of 33 patients with RAU showed to have the villous atrophy typical of celiac disease, along with his- tological signs of immunological reactions to food antigens.24 The remaining patients also exhibited these types of signs but to a lesser degree. Although villous atrophy is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity may take other forms: Gluten may act directly on the oral mucosa or produce functional changes in the small intestine by immunological or other mechanisms that are distinct from those causing the characteristic abnormalities of celiac disease.26 An underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy could also contribute to nutritional deficiencies. Withdrawing gluten from the diet results in complete remission of RAU in patients with celiac disease and some improvement in others.24-27 Even in the absence of villous atrophy, gluten sensitivity can produce RAU. For example, in one small study, three of four gluten-sensitive patients identified by positive antibodies to alpha-gliadin but with nor- mal small intestinal biopsy responded dramatically to a gluten-free diet.28 We recommend ruling out celiac disease by measuring tissue trans- glutaminase and reticulin antibodies in any patient presenting with RAU.

## Dietary Factors

A study of students at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine used a questionnaire to investigate the occurrence of RAU.29 Researchers found that bedtime later than 11 pm, dry mouth, constant thirst, and frequent intake of carbonated beverages were independent risk factors of RAU. The data also supported avoidance of fried food, sweet drinks, pineapple, and spicy foods, moderate intake of nuts, and cautioned intake of fruits.

## Mechanical Injuries

In many RAU patients, lesions appear on the oral mucosa shortly after mechanical trauma to the area.30 Accidental bites of the mucosal tissue, hard brushing of the mucosal tissue, or injuries from rigid solid foods can lead to posttraumatic aphthae.

## Hormonal Changes

RAU may occur or increase in severity during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. A case which responded to implants of low doses of testosterone was published in the British Medical Journal in 1981.31

## Stress

Stress is often a precipitating factor in RAU, suggesting a breakdown in normal host protective factors.32 Elevated urinary and salivary corti- sol levels demonstrate a significant correlation as markers for stress in patients with RAU.33

## Nutrient Deficiency

The oral cavity is often the first place that nutritional deficiency becomes visible to the physician because of the high turnover rate of the mucosal epithelium. Although several nutrient deficiencies can lead to aphthous stomatitis, thiamin appears to be the most signifi- cant. In one study seeking to examine whether thiamin deficiency is associated with RAU, the level of transketolase (a thiamin-dependent enzyme) was determined in 70 patients with RAU and 50 patients from a control group.34 Low levels of transketolase were found in 49 of patients with RAS, compared with only 2 of 50 among the controls. These results clearly demonstrate an association between low levels of thiamin and RAU. Several other studies show that nutrient deficiencies are much more common in RAU sufferers than in others. For example, a study of 330 patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) found that (14.2%) were deficient in iron, folate, vitamin B 12 , or a combination of those nutrients.35 In another study of 60 patients, 28.2% were deficient in thiamin, riboflavin, or pyridoxine.36 When the patients’ deficiencies were corrected, the majority had complete remission. Lower dietary intake of folate and vitamin B 12 is common in persons with RAU, and treatment with 1000 mcg per day has shown benefit regardless of serum vitamin B 12 levels.37 Additional studies have shown similar defi- ciency rates for the same nutrients and equally positive responses to supplementation.38 Zinc supplementation has also been shown to be helpful. A pilot study showed a significant association between zinc deficiency and RAU. In the study, 28% of 25 subjects with RAU had zinc deficiency compared with 4% of 25 healthy controls.39 In one double-blind study, 40 patients with RAU were given either zinc sulfate (220 mg providing 50 mg of elemental zinc) or a placebo once daily for 1 month.40 Results showed that the levels of serum zinc before treatment were below the normal value in 42.5% of the patients with RAU. After 1 month of zinc therapy, the aphthae reduced and did not reappear for 3 months. Low nutrient status may explain why patients with RAU have an increased oxidant/antioxidant ratio in comparison with healthy con- trols. A small study of adolescents showed a reduction in the incidence of RAU and associated pain from 2000 mg per day of ascorbate.41 In another study, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and catalase (CAT) activities as well as and malondialde- hyde (MDA) and antioxidant potential (AOP) levels were measured in plasma and erythrocytes from 22 patients with RAS and 23 con- trols.42 Researchers found decreased CAT and GSHPx activities and AOP levels in the erythrocytes as well as decreased AOP and increased MDA plasma levels in patients with RAU in comparison with control subjects. This study clearly demonstrated that enzymatic and nonenzy- matic antioxidant defense systems are impaired in patients with RAU. In an Italian study, a multivitamin, a proprietary topical drug, and the long-lasting anesthetic ropivacaine were used separately and in combination for patients with RAU.43 Researchers determined the combination of the three agents was a reliable therapy for patients with oral aphthosis, providing significant reduction of pain and length of healing time. Oral microbiome research suggests that an imbalance of the oral mucosal microbiome, rather than individual infectious pathogens, may play a role in initiating RAU. The findings raise the question of whether the presence of a lesion alters the microbiota of the oral cavity or a change in microbiota triggers the development of aphthosis. There is likely interplay between the two. One study compared the buccal microbiota of patients with RAU with control subjects and concluded that differences in bacteria were related to the presence of lesions during sampling. Bacterial diversity in the oral microbiota were similar in patients with RAU and controls.44 Another study found that RAU is associated with dysbiosis of the mucosal and salivary microbiota and identified associations between RAU risk and decreased Streptococcus salivarius and increased Acinetobacter johnsonii.45

## Quercetin

Quercetin is known to inhibit mast cell degranulation, basophil his- tamine release, and the formation of other mediators of inflamma- tion.46 The antiallergy drug disodium cromoglycate, a compound similar in structure and function to quercetin, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of RAU, resulting in more ulcer-free days and mild symptomatic relief.47 Other flavonoids (acacetin, apigenin, chrysin, and phloretin but not catechin, flavone, morin, rutin, or tax- ifolin) have also shown antiallergy effects similar to those of disodium cromoglycate.46

<!-- chunk -->

## Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice

Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) may be effective in promoting the healing of RAU. In one study, 20 patients were instructed to use a solu- tion of DGL as a mouthwash (200 mg of powdered DGL dissolved in 200 mL of warm water) four times daily.48 Of the 20 patients, 15 (75%) experienced 50% to 75% improvement within 1 day, followed by com- plete healing of the ulcers by the third day. DGL in tablet form may be more convenient and effective. Topical preparations containing the solid extract of licorice root are also available (e.g., Canker Cover made by Quantum Health). A randomized controlled trial showed significant efficacy of a paste containing Myrtus communis (myrtle) for RAU when applied four times daily for 6 days.49


Data suggests that no single factor is solely responsible for the initi- ation of aphthous lesions. However, an underlying genetic tendency may be present, the expression of which is facilitated by multiple fac- tors. Considerable evidence suggests that gluten sensitivity may be a contributing factor in some patients. In addition, nutrient deficiencies must be corrected and anti-inflammatory nutrients prescribed. A ran- domized controlled trial showed significant benefit from individual- ized homeopathic treatment, when the medicine was administered in 6 c potency as oral liquid for two doses only.50


The patient’s diet should be free of known allergens and all glu- ten sources if gluten sensitivity is present. Fried foods, carbonated sodas, and sweet drinks should be avoided. Acidic foods (toma- toes, citrus, pineapple) should also be avoided if found to trigger aphthae.

## 1119CHAPTER 148 Asthma

Asthma is often clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), and peak expiratory flow rate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diagnostic Considerations

The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma (Table 148.1) state that a diagnosis of asthma begins by assessing whether any of the indicators is present: • Wheezing—high-pitched whistling sounds on expiration—espe- cially in children (Lack of wheezing and a normal chest examina- tion do not exclude asthma.) • History of any of the following: • Cough, particularly worse at night • Recurrent wheeze • Recurrent difficulty in breathing • Recurrent chest tightness • Symptoms occur or worsen in the presence of: • Exercise • Viral infection • Animals with fur or hair • House dust mites (in mattresses, pillows, upholstered furniture, carpets) • Mold • Smoke (tobacco, wood) • Pollen • Changes in weather • Strong emotional expression (laughing or crying hard) • Airborne chemicals or dusts • Menstrual cycles • Symptoms that occur or worsen at night, awakening the patient Spirometry plays a central role in the management of asthma and should be performed at the time of initial diagnosis, after treatment is initiated and symptoms are stabilized, whenever control of symptoms deteriorates, and every 1 or 2 years on a regular basis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Causes

Asthma is caused by a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a his- tory of atopic disease. The presence of atopic dermatitis increases the risk of asthma by three- to fourfold. Allergies and the response of the immune system are obviously involved in asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammation and Th1/Th2 Balance

Imbalances in T-helper cell immune responses appear to be a funda- mental mechanism of immunologically mediated airway inflamma- tion. CD4+ T-helper cells are generally categorized into Th1 and Th2 cells. Via the release of interferons and interleukin 2, the Th1 pathway is increased in the immunological responses to cancer, multiple scle- rosis, viruses, and type IV hypersensitivities. Th2 responses are related to increases in interleukins 4, 6, 9, and 13; IgE, eosinophilia; and activated B-cell humoral immunity. Clinical conditions that reflect increased Th2 responses include asthma and atopic syndromes as well as allergies. Research involving asthmatic subjects demonstrates a nor- mal Th1 gene expression but a constant upregulation of Th2-specific genes, leading to Th2 predominance.7 Although it is unclear what the cause of this exaggerated Th2 response is in asthma, it seems that genetics, fungi, metal toxicities, nutrition, viruses, and pollution are factors in this upregulation (Fig. 148.1).8 The “hygiene hypothesis” is also gaining ground in the standard medical literature. It asserts that by minimizing exposure to infectious agents owing to lifestyle choices based on hygienic concerns, the dominance of Th2 immune responses to environmental allergens has been favored and thus also the probable encouragement of asthma and atopic diseases.9,10

## Mediators

Both extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved primarily with Th2 imbal- ances trigger the cytokine-activated release of mast cell–derived chemi- cal mediators. These mediators are responsible for bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and other signs and symptoms in the majority of cases. These mediators are either preformed within granules or gener- ated from membrane-bound phospholipids. The preformed mediators include histamine, various chemotactic peptides such as eosinophilic chemolactic factor (ECF) and high-molecular-weight neutrophil

## 1120SECTION 6 Diseases

chemotactic factor (NCF), proteases, glycosidases, and heparin proteo- glycan. The membrane-derived agents include lipoxygenase products such as leukotrienes (LTs) and the so-called slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These mediators are diverse in chemical composition and modes of action and account for many of the signs and symptoms of asthma. Their actions include bronchial smooth muscle constriction (hista- mine, LTC 4 , LTD 4 and LTE 4 , PGF 2a , PGD 2 , and PAF), mucosal edema (increased permeability, histamine, LTC 4 , LTD 4 , and PAF), vasodila- tion (PGD 2 and PGE 2 ), mucous plugging (histamine, hydroxyeico- satetraenoic [HETE] acids, and LTC 4 ), inflammatory cell infiltrate (NCF, ECF-A, HETEs, LTB 4 , and PAF), and desquamation of epithe- lium (proteases and glycosidases, together with lysosomal enzymes and basic proteins derived from neutrophils and eosinophils). In chronic asthma, eventual airway remodeling is a consequence of these medi- ator effects. The cellular and mediator elements responsible for air- way remodeling involve the anomalous interface between the airway epithelium and the underlying mesenchymal tissues. This process is highlighted by the induction of growth factors that encourage fibro- blastic and smooth muscle proliferation and the deposition of matrix proteins, which cause the thickening of the airway wall linked to bron- chial hyperresponsiveness and fixed airflow obstruction.4 Mild episodic asthma differs from moderate to severe sustained asthma in that the latter is largely dependent on a subacute/chronic inflammation of the bronchi with infiltration of eosinophils, neutro- phils, and mononuclear cells, whereas episodic asthma is due primarily to bronchial smooth muscle contraction.

## Lipoxygenase Products

The most potent chemical mediators in asthma are the lipoxygen- ase products (i.e., leukotrienes) (Fig. 148.2). The leukotrienes com- posing SRS-A (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) are 1000 times more potent as stimulators of bronchial constriction than histamine. Researchers have observed that patients with asthma have an imbalance in arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to a relative increase in lip- oxygenase products.11 Platelets from patients with asthma show a 40% decrease in cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites and a 70% Fig. 148.1 Potential triggers and innate immune response of eosinophilic (Th2-dependent) and neutrophilic (non-Th2-dependent) asthma.

increase in lipoxygenase products. This pathophysiologic alteration is further aggravated in “aspirin-induced asthma.” Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., indomethacin, phenylbutazone) inhibit cyclooxygenase while promoting lipoxy- genase.12,13 The net result is a shunting of arachidonic acid toward the lipoxygenase pathway and the production of excessive levels of leukotrienes.

## Autonomic Nervous System

The relationship between the autonomic nervous system and bron- chial asthma represents an interaction between parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation and beta 2 adrenergic receptors (which are localized in lung tissue and react to circulating catecholamines).14 Stimulation of the parasympathetic vagus nerve results in airway con- striction. This vagal mechanism involves the release of acetylcholine at the synapse, subsequent binding to its receptor on smooth muscle tissue, and subsequent formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Accumulation of cGMP or a relative deficiency in cyclic ade- nosine monophosphate (cAMP), or both, will result in constriction of the airway smooth muscle and degranulation of mast cells and baso- phils. Decreased sympathetic activity or diminished beta 2 receptor numbers or sensitivity also promote the cyclic nucleotide imbalance. Some of the mediators discussed earlier block beta 2 receptors and ele- vate cGMP levels both directly and indirectly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adrenal Gland

The activity of the adrenal gland is important in asthma because of the hormones cortisol and epinephrine. Cortisol is an effective prime acti- vator of beta receptors, and epinephrine is considered to be the prime stimulator of beta receptors. It has been suggested that during asth- matic attacks, there is a relative deficiency of cortisol and epinephrine (which stimulates beta 2 receptors to catalyze the formation of cAMP from AMP). This leads to a decrease in the cAMP:cGMP ratio, result- ing in bronchial constriction.

## Vaccinations

## Pertussis Vaccine

An evaluation of health criteria among 448 children and adolescents in Britain who had received only breast milk for the first 6 months of life and, in particular, on the first day after birth produced some interest- ing findings.15 All of the children were weaned after 1 year of age and were older than 4 years at the time the parents responded. The mean age was 7.87 years. In response to the question “Has your child ever been diagnosed as asthmatic?” there were 30 positive answers (6.72%). The surprise came when the researchers classified the respondents according to whether they had received the pertussis vaccine. Among the 243 immunized children, 26 were diagnosed as having asthma (10.69%). In contrast, of the 203 children who had not been immunized, only 4 had asthma (1.97%). The relative risk of developing asthma from the pertussis vaccine was 5.43 in this study. Even though all the children who received the pertussis vaccine received other vacci- nations, the researchers suspected that the statistical evidence focused on pertussis. Among the children who did not receive the pertussis vaccine, most had received some other vaccination. Of the 91 subjects of the study who received no vaccines, only 1 had asthma, compared with 3 with asthma in the 112 who had other vaccinations. Therefore the relative risk of developing asthma is about 1% in children receiv- ing no immunizations, 3% in those receiving vaccinations other than pertussis, and 11% in those receiving the pertussis vaccine. Another notable finding in the group not immunized to pertussis is that developed whooping cough compared with only 1 in the immunized group.

## Influenza Vaccine

One evaluation of more than 9600 children was employed to determine the safety of the cold-adapted trivalent intranasal influenza virus vac- cine in children. Although this relatively new vaccination was deemed safe for children and adolescents, a significantly increased relative risk of 4.06 was observed in children 18 to 35 months of age for asthma and associated reactive airways disease.16

## Environmental Toxins

The atmosphere is awash with a mixture of toxic substances, and inha- lation of these toxicants can contribute to significant injury to the pulmonary system. Industrial materials, particulates from mining and combustion, agricultural chemicals, cigarette smoke, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and toxic metals have all been implicated in the pathophysiol- ogy of lung disease. Although these agents belong to different classes of chemicals, they may activate similar biochemical pathways, including inducing the recruitment and activation of macrophages, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, inhibition of protein synthesis, and production of interleukin-1 beta.17

## Particulate Matter

Rapid industrialization and urbanization in many parts of the world have exposed more people to air pollutants now than at any point in human history. Exposure to PM 0.1 activates signal- ing pathways (e.g., nuclear factor kappa B [NF- κ B], nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidase) that induce inflammation, generate reactive oxygen species, and lead to cell death, which may explain the association between long-term parti- cle accumulation and chronic respiratory diseases.18 Several stud- ies have explored the relationship between childhood asthma and respiratory problems with exposure to vehicle exhaust. Children in the Netherlands living within 100 m of a freeway had signifi- cantly more cough, wheeze, rhinitis, and asthma than those living farther away.19 Among children living within 150 m of a main road, the risk of wheeze increased with increasing proximity by an odds ratio of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.36) per 30-m increment.20 Fine and ultrafine diesel exhaust particles can reach small airways, including the alveolar/gas-exchange regions of the lung, exacerbating asthma symptoms. Direct exposure to diesel exhaust has been linked to the development of asthma, which persists even after exposure ceases.21

## Ozone

Asthma-related visits to the emergency department (ED) are associ- ated with ozone levels. A study in New Jersey reported that ED visits for asthma occurred 28% more frequently when the mean ozone levels were greater than 0.06 ppm than when they were less than 0.06 ppm.22 Children exposed to higher levels of ground-level ozone have greater rates of asthma and rhinitis than children in areas with less ozone.23

## Acrolein

Acrolein (a contact herbicide used, for example, to control weeds and algae in irrigation canals) is a potent respiratory irritant and may have a prominent role as an environmental trigger of asthma attacks through air-pollutant emissions and tobacco smoke. Chronic residential expo- sure to outdoor acrolein was found to increase the prevalence-odds of having at least one asthma attack in the previous 12 months by approx- imately 8%.24

consuming groundwater with arsenic levels between 11 and 50 ppm.25 A dose-related decrease in lung function exists with increasing levels of baseline water and urinary arsenic.26 For every 1-standard-devia- tion increase in baseline water arsenic exposure, there was a decrease in FEV 1 (–46.5 mL; p = 0.0005) and forced vital capacity (FVC; –53.1 mL; p < 0.01). This inverse association between arsenic exposure and FVC was consistent across sexes, remained significant in never-smok- ers, and was strongest in male smokers.

## Cobalt

Respiratory effects from cobalt inhalation are well documented. Asthma, pneumonia, wheezing, respiratory irritation, and fibrosis have all been reported as occupational health hazards, especially in workers exposed to cobalt metal powder, cobalt salts, and cobalt-containing dusts.27 Exposure to cobalt alone produces an allergic-like asthmatic condition.

<!-- chunk -->

## Occupational Agricultural Exposure

Occupational exposures in the agricultural industry are associated with numerous lung diseases, including asthma. Production agriculture produces a variety of exposures, including organic dusts from livestock barns and confinements and chemical toxicants from fermentation and bacterial degradation of grain and animal wastes, pesticides, microorganisms, and bacterial endotoxins. Asthma-like syndrome is associated with swine confinement workers and grain elevator opera- tors, with acute symptoms occurring in as many as 50%.28 Pesticides may contribute to asthma among farmers and has been associated with wheeze among U.S. farmers. For farmers, the organo- phosphates chlorpyrifos, malathion, and parathion have all been positively associated with wheeze.29 Farmers are more likely to be diagnosed with nonatopic asthma than atopic asthma compared with other occupational groups, although high-pesticide-exposure events have been associated with a doubling of both allergic and nonallergic asthma in farmers.30 Coumaphos, heptachlor, parathion, and ethylene dibromide all have odds ratios of greater than 2.0 for allergic asthma.

## Mold

Exposure to mold and dampness in buildings is a major factor in the asthma epidemic. Studies have shown that dampness or mold in houses causes 21% of asthma in the United States and a 30% to 50% increase in asthma and asthma-related health problems.31 The incidence may be higher; one study found that 67% of adult-onset asthma devel- oped after working in a water-damaged office building.32 The primary mechanisms for damp-building toxicity include immunological (e.g., stimulation, suppression, autoimmunity), toxic (e.g., neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive damage), and inflammatory. The Institute of Medicine report commissioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and released in 2004 concluded that respiratory conditions, including asthma, have sufficient evidence of causation by mold or damp buildings.33

## Drugs

<!-- chunk -->

## Aspirin/NSAIDs

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is an asthma pheno- type and has a prevalence of 2% to 25% in the asthma population.34 Precipitation of asthma attacks by the ingestion of aspirin and other NSAIDs is considered a hallmark of this syndrome. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygen- ase and promote lipoxygenase. The net result is a shunting of arachi- donic acid toward the lipoxygenase pathway and the production of excessive levels of leukotrienes. AERD is chronic, and the respiratory mucosal inflammatory disease persists even with avoidance of cycloo- xygenase 1 (COX-1) inhibitors.

## Beta Blockers

In almost all patients with asthma, nonselective beta blockers cause bronchoconstriction and increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and histamine.35 The regular use of noncardioselective beta blockers was demonstrated to cause a 13.5% decrease in FEV 1 . Topical applications should be avoided as well because severe bron- choconstriction and fatal attacks have been reported with topical oph- thalmic application of beta blockers.36

## Other

Several other medications have been shown to cause bronchospasm or mimic asthma, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, cholinergic agonists, cholinomimetic alkaloids, chemother- apeutic agents, diuretics, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and radiocontrast dyes.37


As with many complex diseases, the initial cause or causes of asthma (e.g., hypochlorhydria) may initiate a sequence of events that becomes self-propagating (e.g., hypochlorhydria-induced food allergies leading to increased intestinal permeability and then to increased susceptibil- ity to food allergy). Effective treatment requires control of both the initiating cause or causes and the induced physiological abnormalities.

## General

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypochlorhydria

Fractional gastric analyses in 200 children with asthma showed that 80% of them had gastric acid secretions below normal levels.38 Hypochlorhydria may initiate a sequence of events that becomes self-propagating. The high occurrence of decreased gastric acid output may predispose these children to food allergies and has a major effect on the success of rotation or elimination diets and, if not corrected, on the development of additional food allergies (i.e., hypochlorhydria- induced food allergies leading to increased intestinal permeability, which then increases the susceptibility to food allergy).

<!-- chunk -->

## Increased Intestinal Permeability

The presence of food allergies is thought to be responsible for patients with asthma having been shown to have “leaky guts.”39 Altered intes- tinal barrier function permits increased dietary antigen transport across the intestinal barrier and subsequent exposure of these anti- gens to the mucosal immune system, leading to the development of antigen-specific responses. This overwhelms the immune system, increasing the likelihood of developing additional allergies as well as increasing the circulation of bronchoconstrictive compounds. It is essential to identify offending foods as soon as possible so as to avoid the development of further allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Candida albicans

An overgrowth of the common yeast Candida albicans in the gastroin- testinal tract has been implicated as a causative factor in allergic condi- tions, including asthma. Apparently, the acid protease produced by C. albicans is the responsible allergen.40 Appropriate anticandidal therapy may result in significant clinical improvement of asthma in many cases.

## Food Additives

Vitally important in the control of asthma is the elimination of food additives.41 Artificial dyes and preservatives are widely used in foods, beverages, and drugs. The most common coloring agents are azo dyes—tartrazine (yellow dye no. 5), sunset yellow, amaranth, and coc- cine (red)—and the nonazo dye pate blue. The most commonly used

<!-- chunk -->

## 1123CHAPTER 148 Asthma

preservatives in food are sodium benzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate esters, and sulfur dioxide. Tartrazine, benzoates, sulfur dioxide, and sulfites have been reported to cause asthma attacks in susceptible individuals.41,42 Tartrazine is commonly found in processed foods, vitamin prepara- tions, and prescription drugs and acts as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, thus inducing asthma, especially in children. Approximately 4% to 14% of individuals with asthma are sensitive to acetylsalicylic acid and may react to this dye.43 Various sulfites are commonly used in prepared foods. It is esti- mated that 2 to 3 mg of sulfites are consumed each day by the average U.S. citizen, whereas an additional 5 to 10 mg are ingested by wine and beer drinkers.42 The largest sources are the salads, vegetables (particu- larly potatoes), and avocado dip served in restaurants. A customer can ingest 25 to 100 mg of metabisulfite in as little as one restaurant meal. It has been postulated that a molybdenum deficiency may be responsi- ble for sulfite sensitivity.44 Sulfite oxidase, the enzyme responsible for neutralizing sulfites, is molybdenum dependent.

## Salt

Strong evidence indicates that an increased intake of salt increases bronchial reactivity and mortality from asthma.45,46 Dietary patterns of high fat, sugar, and salt are significantly associated with asthma prev- alence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.24) and current severe asthma (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.48).47 The degree of bronchial reactivity to histamine is positively correlated with the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and rises with increased dietary sodium. Because the severity of asthma correlates with the degree of bronchial reactivity, the severity of asthma can clearly be influenced by alterations in dietary sodium consumption.

## Estrogen and Progesterone

For female patients who experience severe asthma symptoms, it may be useful to consider therapeutic regimens that encourage a decrease in hormonal fluctuations. Some studies find estrogen withdrawal to increase lung contractility.48 However, other studies find little relationship between estrogen use and asthmatic symptoms.49–51 Estrogen52 and progesterone are both known to act as smooth mus- cle relaxants. It may be that the airways of premenopausal and post- menopausal women may respond differently to exogenous hormone replacement and therefore need to be assessed independently with this intervention. One interesting review of more than 90 papers published from to 2001 found that during the premenstrual and menstrual phases, when hormone levels are low, women with asthma have been found to experience increased asthma exacerbations, increased hospitalizations for asthma, and decreased pulmonary function. Additionally, women who experienced decreased fluctuations in hormone levels either by becoming pregnant or by starting oral contraceptive therapy tended to have improvements in pulmonary function and fewer requirements for medication.48 Natural hormone replacement may offer a safer approach than synthetic hormones, although no studies to verify the safety or efficacy of these natural forms of female sex hormones have been conducted. In the longer term, natural therapeutics designed to balance estrogen and progesterone, along with specific recommenda- tions from this chapter, may offer the most risk-free relief for those premenopausal and postmenopausal women who suffer from asth- matic exacerbations (see Chapters 196 and 212).

## Dehydroepiandrosterone

Decreased levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) have been shown to be common in postmenopausal women with asthma compared with matched controls.53 One study of 55 asthmatic and 20 healthy postmenopausal women aged 48 to 60 before hormone replacement therapy and after 6 months of transdermal 17b-estradiol (E2) and medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment demonstrated a significant increase in serum DHEA levels in the asthmatic group, with no change in the control group.54 Whether DHEA itself produces any therapeu- tic benefit in asthma remains to be demonstrated; however, given its important role in proper immune function, an ability to produce pos- itive effects is certainly possible.

<!-- chunk -->

## Melatonin

There is some concern regarding elevated melatonin levels contributing to increased airway inflammation in patients with nocturnal asthmatic exacerbations.55,56 In a study of people with nocturnal asthma, the peak measured serum melatonin level was significantly and inversely correlated with overnight change in FEV 1 in subjects with nocturnal asthma but not in those with nonnocturnal asthma or healthy con- trols. An interesting note is that this study observed a delayed release of melatonin in the patients with nocturnal asthma. Therefore it is theo- retically possible that supplementation combined with an earlier sleep regimen may help regulate this late peaking of melatonin and possibly mitigate symptoms. Nevertheless, the practitioner may want to avoid giving this supplement to patients with asthma, especially the noc- turnal type, until more studies are conducted regarding melatonin’s immunotherapeutic effect.

## Beneficial Foods

A number of publications corroborate the notion that people who have a diet rich in fruits and vegetables have a lower risk of poor respira- tory health.57–59 This effect is most likely due to the increased levels of antioxidants in such foods. One epidemiological review60 found that among children, consumption of fresh fruit, particularly fruit high in vitamin C, has been related to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms and better lung function. This effect was observed even at low levels of fruit consumption (one or two servings per week vs. fewer than one serving per week), which suggests that a small increase in fruit intake could be beneficial. This same review discussed the consumption of fish as also being related to lower airway hyperreactivity among chil- dren and better lung function in adults. A study of Scottish adults also found a dose–response relation- ship between fruit consumption and pulmonary function, whereby increased fruit consumption led to decreases in phlegm and better pul- monary function.61 In addition, a “reasonable” intake of fruit (>180 g/ day), whole grains (>45 g/day), and moderate alcohol consumption (one to three glasses a day) was associated with a 139-mL-higher FEV 1 and a 50% lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus diets that did not meet these intake requirements.57 Finally, one study of 607 asthma patients and 864 controls highlighted apples and moderate red wine consumption as sources of antioxidants that decreased asthma severity.62 Dietary intake of soy foods may be helpful because the soy isofla- vone genistein is associated with reduced severity of asthma. Although this effect may be due to some antioxidant action, studies have also shown that genistein is able to block eosinophil leukotriene C(4) syn- thesis and inhibit the pathway of NF- κ B and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ) in patients with asthma.63–65

## Food Allergy

Many studies have indicated that food allergies play an important role in asthma (see Chapter 14).66–70 Adverse reactions to food may be immediate or delayed. Double-blind food challenges in children have

<!-- chunk -->

## 1124SECTION 6 Diseases

shown that immediate-onset sensitivities are usually due (in decreas- ing order of frequency) to egg, fish, shellfish, nuts, and peanuts, whereas the foods most commonly associated with delayed onset include (in decreasing order of frequency) milk, chocolate, wheat, citrus, and food colorings.68 Elimination diets have been successful in identifying allergens and treating asthma and are a particularly valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool in infants.71 Elimination of common allergens during infancy (first 2 years) has been shown to reduce allergic tendencies in high-risk children (e.g., strong familial history).72

## Breastfeeding

Many studies have demonstrated the protective effect of breastfeed- ing in the prevention of asthma. One study examined the association of breastfeeding and the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms among 5182 Brazilian schoolchildren 7 to 14 years of age. Ninety per- cent of the mothers in this population had breastfed their infants. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, these researchers revealed that children who had not been breastfed were more likely to have a medical diagnosis of asthma.73 One Iraqi study additionally showed that the vitamin C content of breast milk was significantly correlated with the maternal intake of vitamin C; low vitamin C intake by the mother translates to low intake by the child, thus leaving him or her more susceptible to oxidative stress.74 The Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention study collected 2 years of data in which researchers chose 545 infants who were considered at high risk for asthma on the basis of a history of familial atopy. These children were broken down into control and intervention groups. The interventions included (1) measures to control house dust; (2) recom- mendations for avoidance of pets, environmental tobacco smoke, and day care during the first year; and (3) only breastfeeding or the use of partially hydrolyzed whey formula until at least the age of 4 months. At 1 year of age, the risk of asthma was significantly reduced by 34%. At 2 years of age, significantly fewer children had asthma in the inter- vention group than in the control group (16.3% vs. 23%), and 60% fewer of those in the intervention group had persistent asthma. A 90% reduction in recurrent wheeze was seen in the intervention group com- pared with the control group.75 Studies like these are quite useful to elucidate the multitude of changes necessary to affect multifactorial diseases like asthma in an effective manner.

## Antibiotics, Probiotics, and Mucosal IgA

In a combined analysis of seven studies involving more than 12,000 youngsters, researchers at the University of British Columbia found that those prescribed antibiotics before their first birthday were more than twice as likely as untreated kids to develop asthma.76 Additionally, if they had multiple courses of antibiotics, it bumped up the risk even higher—16% for every course of the drugs taken before age 1. There are a couple of explanations for this association between antibiotic use and asthma. One is that antibiotics contribute to a state of “excess hygiene,” leading to a reduced exposure to microbes. This, in turn, creates an oversensitive immune system, mounting an over-the-top allergic reaction to pollen and dust mites and ultimately resulting in asthma. The second explanation is that antibiotics have a negative effect on the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory passages. Some studies have shown that giving probiotics (active cul- tures of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species) lowers the risk of atopic allergic diseases like asthma and eczema. Some of this protective effect may be mediated by mucosal IgA, which participates in antigen elimination. In a cohort of 237 allergy-prone infants given a combi- nation of four probiotic strains or placebo, it was shown that supple- mentation with probiotics increased fecal IgA and calprotectin while reducing inflammatory markers (e.g., α1 -antitrypsin and TNF- α ).77 In infants with a high fecal IgA concentration at the age of 6 months, the risk of having any allergic disease or any IgE-associated (atopic) disease before the age of 2 years was cut by nearly 50%. High intestinal IgA in early life is associated with minimal intestinal inflammation and indi- cates a reduced risk for IgE-associated allergic diseases.

## Vegan Diet

A long-term trial of a vegan diet (elimination of all animal products) provided significant improvement in 92% of the 25 treated patients who completed the study (9 dropped out).78 Improvement was deter- mined by a number of clinical variables, including vital capacity, FEV 1 , and physical working capacity, as well as by biochemical indices such as haptoglobin, IgM, IgE, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in the blood. The researchers also found a reduction in the vulnerability to infection. Importantly, although 71% of the patients responded within 4 months, 1 year of therapy was required before the 92% level was reached. The diet excluded all meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Drinking water was limited to spring water (chlorinated tap water was specifi- cally prohibited). Coffee, ordinary tea, chocolate, sugar, and salt were also excluded. Herbal spices were allowed, and water and herbal teas were allowed up to 1.5 L/day. Vegetables eaten freely were lettuce, carrots, beets, onions, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, nettles, cucumber, radishes, Jerusalem artichokes, and all beans except soy- beans and green peas. Potatoes were allowed in restricted amounts. A number of fruits were also eaten freely: blueberries, cloudberries, raspberries, strawberries, black currants, gooseberries, plums, and pears. Apples and citrus fruits were not allowed, and grains were either restricted or eliminated. The beneficial effects of this dietary regimen are probably related to three areas: • Elimination of food allergens • Altered prostaglandin metabolism • Increased intake of antioxidant nutrients and magnesium In regard to altered prostaglandin metabolism, the avoidance of dietary sources of arachidonic acid (derived from animal products) appears to be significant. The prostaglandins and leukotrienes derived from arachidonic acid contribute significantly to the allergic reaction in asthma. The decreased availability of arachidonic acid as a substrate of these inflammatory compounds appears to explain some aspects of the efficacy of the vegan diet. The benefits of altering prostaglan- din metabolism are further discussed later, as is the role of increased dietary antioxidants in preventing asthma. Aside from the patients’ improvement in health from the vegan diet, there was a significant reduction in healthcare costs (the patients had been receiving corticosteroids and other drugs and therapies for an average of 12 years), and according to the authors, patients changed their attitudes in terms of taking greater responsibility for their own health.

## Nutrition

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Epidemiological studies have shown that children who eat fish more than once a week have one-third the risk of asthma of children who do not eat fish regularly.79 Several clinical studies have shown that increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids through supplementation with fish oils containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid offers significant benefits in asthma, as noted by improvements in airway responsiveness to allergens as well as improvements in respi- ratory function.80,81 These benefits are related to an increased ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in cell membranes, thereby reducing

<!-- chunk -->

## 1125CHAPTER 148 Asthma

the availability of arachidonic acid. In particular, the ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids leads to a significant shift in leukotriene synthe- sis from the extremely inflammatory 4-series to the less inflammatory 5-series leukotrienes. This shift is directly related to improvements in asthma symptoms.82 The benefits may take as long as 1 year to become apparent because it seems to take time to turn over cellular membranes in favor of the omega-3 fatty acids.

## Tryptophan Metabolism and Pyridoxine Supplementation

Children with asthma have been shown to have a metabolic defect in tryptophan metabolism and reduced platelet transport for sero- tonin.83,84 Tryptophan is converted to serotonin, a known bronchoc- onstricting agent in asthmatics. High serotonin levels in the blood and sputum are common findings in patients with asthma and are reflected by an elevated urinary level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the breakdown product of serotonin. The levels of 5-HIAA in the urine correlate well with the severity of asthmatic symptoms. Double-blind clinical studies have shown that patients benefit from either a tryp- tophan-restricted diet83 or pyridoxine supplementation84,85 to correct the blocked tryptophan metabolism. Pyridoxine may also be of direct benefit to patients with asthma. In one study, plasma and erythrocyte pyridoxal phosphate levels in 15 adult patients with asthma were significantly lower than in 16 con- trols.84 Oral supplementation with 50 mg of pyridoxine twice daily to seven of the patients failed to produce a substantial elevation of these low levels. However, all patients reported a dramatic decrease in the frequency and severity of wheezing as well as asthma attacks while tak- ing the supplements. In a study of 76 children with asthma, pyridoxine at a dosage of 200 mg daily produced significant reductions in symp- toms and in dosages of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. However, a double-blind study failed to demonstrate any significant improve- ment with vitamin B 6 supplementation in patients who depended on steroids to control symptoms.86 Although vitamin B 6 supplementation may not help patients on steroids, it is definitely indicated in patients with asthma being treated with the drug theophylline. Theophylline significantly depresses pyr- idoxal-5-phosphate levels.87 In addition, another study has shown that vitamin B 6 supplementation can significantly reduce the typical side effects of theophylline (e.g., headaches, nausea, irritability, sleep disorders).88


The substantial increase in the prevalence of asthma over the past years can be partially explained by the reduced dietary intake of anti- oxidant nutrients like beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, as well as the mineral cofactors essential for antioxidant defense mechanisms, such as zinc, selenium, and copper.89 Patients undergoing acute asth- matic distress are known to have lowered serum total antioxidants.90 Genetic influences may also play a role in the need for antioxidants (see “General Considerations” earlier in the chapter).3 One study of 158 children with moderate to severe asthma revealed that supplementation of 50 mg/day of vitamin E and 250 mg/day of vitamin C conferred significant protection against ozone-induced reductions in pulmonary function.91 Antioxidants are thought to provide important defense mechanisms for main- taining the redox state of the lungs. This protection is significant because oxidizing agents can both stimulate bronchoconstriction and increase hyperactivity to other agents. Asthma appears to be another disease process that is influenced greatly by antioxidant mechanisms. Analgesics like acetaminophen, known to deplete anti- oxidant levels such as glutathione in animals, should be used with caution in asthmatic patients.92

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C is the major antioxidant substance present in extracellular fluid lining the airway surfaces.93 Vitamin C intake in the general pop- ulation appears to correlate with asthma, indicating that low vitamin C (in the diet and the blood) is an independent risk factor for asthma. In a survey of 771 persons with current asthma, 352 with former asthma, and 15,418 without asthma, lower vitamin C concentrations were observed among those with current or former asthma than those who had never had asthma.94 Children of smokers have a higher rate of asthma (cigarette smoke is known to deplete respiratory vitamins C and E levels), and symptoms of ongoing asthma in adults appear to be increased by exposure to environmental prooxidants and decreased by vitamin C supplementation.74 Nitrogen oxides are examples of oxidants that can arise from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Vitamin C has been shown to offer significant protection against nitrogen oxide damage in the lungs of animal models.95 Both treated and untreated patients with asthma have been shown to have significantly lower levels of ascorbic acid in serum and leu- kocytes.95 From a clinical perspective, it appears that patients with asthma have a higher need for vitamin C, with the majority of studies demonstrating significant improvements in respiratory measures and asthma symptoms as a result of supplementing the diet with 1 to 2 g of vitamin C daily.96 This dosage is recommended based on the increas- ing exposure to inhaled oxidants, along with the growing appreciation of the antioxidant function of vitamin C in the respiratory system. High-dose vitamin C therapy may also help asthma by lowering histamine levels.97 The importance of vitamin C as a natural anti- histamine has emerged for several reasons, including concern over the safety of antihistamine medications and the recently recognized immune-suppressing effects of histamine. In the initial stages of an immune response, histamine amplifies the immune response by increasing capillary permeability and smooth muscle contraction, thus enhancing the flow of immune factors to the site of infection. Subsequently, histamine exerts a suppressive effect on the accumulated white blood cells (WBCs) in an attempt to contain the inflammatory response. Vitamin C prevents the secretion of histamine by WBCs and increases the detoxification of histamine. One study examined the anti- histaminic effect of acute and chronic vitamin C administration and its effect on WBC (neutrophil) function in healthy men and women. In the chronic administration arm, 10 subjects ingested a placebo during weeks 1, 2, 5, and 6 and 2 g/day of vitamin C during weeks 3 and 4. Fasting blood samples were collected after the initial 2-week period (baseline) and at the end of weeks 4 and 6. Blood vitamin C levels rose significantly after vitamin C administration, whereas blood histamine levels fell by 38% during the weeks vitamin C was given. The ability of WNCs to move in response to an infection (chemotaxis) increased by 19% during vitamin C administration and fell 30% after vitamin C withdrawal. However, these changes were linked to histamine con- centrations. Chemotaxis was greatest when histamine levels were the lowest. In the part of the study looking at the acute effects of vitamin C, blood histamine concentrations and chemotaxis did not change hours after a single dose of vitamin C. This result suggests that vitamin C will lower blood histamine only if it is taken over time. Individuals prone to allergy or inflammation are encouraged to increase their con- sumption of vitamin C through supplementation.97 In a small study of patients with asthma and documented exer- cise-induced bronchoconstriction, the subjects participated in a ran- domized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial.98 They entered the study on their usual diets and were placed on either 2 weeks of ascorbic acid supplementation (1500 mg/day) or placebo, followed

by a 1-week washout period, before crossing over to the alternative treatment. The ascorbic acid diet significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the maximum fall in postexercise FEV 1 (–6.4 %) compared with the usual diet (–14.3%) and a placebo diet (–12.9%). Asthma symptom scores significantly improved on the ascorbic acid diet compared with the placebo and usual diets. Postexercise inflammatory mediators were also significantly lower with ascorbic acid supplementation.

## Flavonoids

Flavonoids appear to be key antioxidants in the treatment of asthma. Various flavonoids, chief among them being quercetin, have been shown to inhibit the following99–102: • Histamine release from mast cells and basophils when stimulated by antigens and other ligands • Phospholipase A2 in neutrophils • Lipoxygenase • Anaphylactic contraction of smooth muscle • Phosphodiesterase in the lung (resulting in increased cAMP levels) • Biosynthesis of SRS-A • Calcium influx In addition, quercetin has both a vitamin C–sparing effect and a direct stabilizing effect on membranes, including mast cells. Flavonoid-rich extracts such as those from grape seed, pine bark, green tea, or Ginkgo biloba may prove even more helpful than querce- tin in the treatment of asthma because of their enhanced bioavailabil- ity. In particular, the proanthocyanidins from grape seed or pine bark extracts appear to have an affinity for the lungs (for more information, see Chapter 106). In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study involving 60 subjects 6 to 18 years of age, a proprietary pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) significantly improved pulmonary func- tion and asthma symptoms compared with placebo. Specifically, the Pycnogenol group was able to reduce or discontinue the use of rescue inhalers more often than the placebo group. There was also a signifi- cant reduction of urinary leukotrienes in the Pycnogenol group.103 In another study, a flavonoid preparation derived from pur- ple passion fruit peel (PFP) was studied in a 4-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in asthma patients. The dosage of the PFP extract was 150 mg daily. The prevalence of wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath was reduced significantly in the group treated with PFP extract, whereas the placebo caused no significant improve- ment. PFP extract supplementation also resulted in a marked increase in FEV 1 , whereas placebo showed no effect.104

## Carotenes

Carotenes are powerful antioxidants that may increase the integrity of the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract and act as substrates for lipoxygenase, possibly competing with arachidonic acid and thereby decreasing leukotriene formation.105 Some studies have shown that patients with asthma have reduced plasma antioxidant potential due to low whole-blood carotenoids (beta-carotene, lycopene, alpha- carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin),106 in particular low lycopene levels,107 thus making them more susceptible to the damag- ing effects of oxidative stress. Lycopene may emerge as the most use- ful supplemental carotenoid. In animal models of asthma, lycopene supplementation suppressed Th2 responses and reduced eosinophilic infiltrates in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue, and blood as well as the number of mucus-secreting cells in the airways.108 In a proof-of-concept human study, asthmatic adults (n = 32) con- sumed a low-antioxidant diet for 10 days and then commenced a random- ized crossover trial involving three 7-day treatment arms (placebo, tomato extract [45 mg lycopene per day], and tomato juice [45 mg lycopene per day]).109 With the consumption of a low-antioxidant diet, plasma carot- enoid concentrations decreased, Asthma Control Score worsened, lung function (FEV 1 and FVC) decreased, and sputum neutrophils increased. Treatment with both tomato juice and extract reduced airway neutrophil influx. Treatment with tomato extract also reduced sputum neutrophil elastase activity. This short-term study indicates that antioxidant status, particularly in terms of carotenoids, modifies some parameters in asthma. There have been two double-blind studies of lycopene supplemen- tation (30 mg/day) in exercise-induced asthma. One failed to show any benefit,110 whereas another showed that in some patients, it prevented airway constriction and reduced FEV 1 .111

## Vitamin E

Vitamin E’s activity as an antioxidant, lipoxygenase inhibitor, and phospholipase inhibitor makes it a useful supportive agent in asthma treatment.112

## Selenium

Reduced selenium levels have been demonstrated in asthma patients.113–115 Glutathione peroxidase, a selenium-dependent metal- loenzyme, is important for reducing hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) to HETE acid, thereby reducing leukotriene formation. Reduced levels of glutathione peroxidase have also been reported for patients with asthma.113 Supplemental selenium appears warranted to address any deficiency of glutathione peroxidase. In addition, supple- mental selenium may reduce the production of leukotrienes by ensur- ing the optimal activity of glutathione peroxidase.

## Vitamin B


Jonathan Wright, MD, believes that “B 12 therapy is the mainstay in childhood asthma.”116 In one clinical trial, weekly intramuscular injec- tions of 1000 mg produced definite improvements in patients with asthma.117 Of 20 patients, 18 showed less shortness of breath on exer- tion as well as improved appetite, sleep, and general condition. Vitamin B 12 appears to be especially effective in sulfite-sensitive individuals. It offers the best protection when given orally (1–4 mcg) before challenge compared with other pharmacological agents (e.g., cromolyn sodium, atropine, doxepin).118 The mode of action is the formation of a sulfite– cobalamin complex that blocks sulfite’s effect.


In 1912 Trendelenburg demonstrated that magnesium relaxed bovine bronchial smooth muscle in vitro.119 Later, uncontrolled clinical stud- ies revealed magnesium’s beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with acute attacks of bronchial asthma.120 Unfortunately, this promis- ing line of research was dropped as antihistamines and bronchodilators became available. However, the advent of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of asthma generated renewed interest in the therapeutic use of magnesium for asthma. In fact, intravenous magnesium (2 g of magnesium sulfate infused every hour up to a total of 24.6 g) is now a well-proven and clinically accepted measure to halt an acute asthma attack as well as acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.121–125 Although these initial studies used injectable magnesium, it has been demonstrated that this is not necessary to restore magnesium sta- tus except in the case of an emergency situation such as an acute heart attack or an acute asthma attack.126 Oral magnesium therapy is an effec- tive measure to raise body magnesium stores, but it will usually take weeks to achieve significant elevations in tissue magnesium concen- trations. Oral supplementation appears to be warranted because low levels of plasma magnesium have been found in asthmatic patients,92 and dietary magnesium intake is independently related to lung func- tion and the severity of asthma.127 Several double-blind studies in adults and children with asthma have demonstrated improvements in respiratory function, antioxidant status (i.e., increased glutathione

concentrations), reduced reactivity to chemical challenge to metha- choline, and measures of asthma control and quality of life.128–130 The dosages used ranged from 300 mg a day in children to 340 mg a day in adults, usually in divided dosages. Isotonic nebulized magnesium has also proved useful as an adjunct treatment to standard bronchodilation therapies in patients with severe asthma, with a greater response in those with life-threat- ening asthma.131 A randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of inhaled magnesium sulfate on the treatment response in emergency department (ED) patients with moderate to severe asthma.132 Subjects allocated to the study group were treated with a standard protocol, plus 3 mL of 260 mmol/L solution of magnesium sulfate every 20 to 60 minutes. The control group was treated with nebulized saline as a placebo in addition to the standard protocol. The results demonstrate that adding nebulized magnesium sulfate to standard therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma attacks led to greater and faster improvement in PEFR, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate and reduces hospitalization rates.

## Vitamin D

Vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased airway reactivity, poorer lung function, and worse asthma control.133 One study in more than 1000 children with asthma showed that 35% were vita- min D–insufficient, as defined by a level of 30 ng/mL or less of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.134 After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, income, and treatment group, insufficient vitamin D status was associated with higher odds of hospitalization or emergency department visits (OR 1.5). In addition to correcting a vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation may improve asthma control by blocking the cascade of inflammation-causing proteins in the lung as well as increasing the production of interleukin-10, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Preliminary clinical evidence is encouraging, especially in the prevention of childhood asthma, at a dosage of 1200 IU per day of vitamin D 3 .135 Although there is conflicting evidence from clinical trials, results from in vivo and in vitro studies in animals and humans have suggested that supplementation with vitamin D may ameliorate several hallmark features of asthma, and vitamin D deficiency may influence the inflammatory response in the airways.136


Asthma patients commonly employ self-treatment with botanicals. A cross-sectional analysis of 601 adults with asthma found that 14% used either herbal products, coffee, or black tea to treat their condi- tion. Unfortunately, this study illustrated that those who used these methods had a higher incidence of hospitalizations.137 Because of the possibility of improper use of botanicals and the inability of the users to recognize the need for acute conventional interventions, it is rec- ommended that before using natural therapies, patients with asthma consult a naturopathic physician or other qualified practitioner who understands the proper use of botanicals and can assess the asthmatic patient’s severity of risk. The most popular historical herbal treatment of asthma involved the use of Ephedra sinensis (Ma huang) in combination with herbal expectorants. This approach appeared to have considerable merit because Ephedra and its alkaloids have proven to be effective as bron- chodilators in treating mild to moderate asthma and hay fever.138,139 Ephedra preparations containing ephedrine alkaloids are no longer sold in the United States because of safety concerns. However, ephedra extracts without ephedrine are still legally sold.

## Hedera helix (Ivy)

In Europe, herbal preparations containing extracts from the leaves of ivy are popular for the relief of cough as well as asthma. In 2007 more than 80% of herbal expectorants prescribed in Germany comprised ivy extract and amounted to nearly 2 million prescriptions nationwide. Ivy leaf contains saponins that show expectorant, mucolytic, spasmolytic, bronchodilatory, and antibacterial effects. The mucolytic and expec- torant actions of ivy are based on indirect beta 2 adrenergic effects, and these actions are due to the saponins α -hederin and hederacoside C, the latter of which is metabolized to α -hederin when ingested.140 The indirect effect involves α -hederin, which inhibits the intracellular uptake of beta 2 receptors and leads to an increased beta 2 -adrenergic response of the cell. A 2003 meta-analysis of three double-blind studies in children showed that the ivy preparations used were significantly superior to placebo.141 Among the three trials, one study compared ivy leaf extract cough drops to placebo, one compared suppositories to drops, and one tested syrup against drops. The reviewers concluded that ivy leaf extract preparations are effective with respect to the improvement of respiratory function in children with chronic bronchial asthma but noted that the study had a meager database to assess. In the only pla- cebo-controlled double-blind study reviewed, 24 children with asthma between the ages of 4 and 12 were given a dry ivy leaf extract (35 mg) in cough drops or placebo for 3 days with a washout of 3 to 5 days before crossing over to the other treatment. The superiority of ivy leaf extract over placebo was noted by small improvements in airway resistance, residual volume, vital capacity, FVC, and FEV 1 when the baseline mea- surements were compared with day 3 at 3 hours postdosing (morning dose).

## Glycyrrhiza glabra

Licorice root has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory and anti- allergic agent, as documented in the scientific literature (see Chapter 85). The primary active component of licorice root in this applica- tion is glycyrrhetinic acid, a compound that has shown cortisol-like activity. In particular, glycyrrhetinic acid has been shown to inhibit phospholipase A 2 , the enzyme responsible for cleaving arachidonic acid from the phospholipid membrane pool and initiating eicosanoid synthesis.142 Licorice is also an expectorant, which is useful in the treat- ment of asthma.

## Lobelia inflata

Indian tobacco contains the alkaloid lobeline, an efficient expectorant. Although it has a long history of use in asthma, it does promote bron- choconstriction and is a respiratory stimulant in vitro.143 This appears to suggest a cholinergic effect in the respiratory system; it also binds to nicotine acetylcholine receptors in the ganglions, thus promoting the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. It is this action on adrenal hormone secretion that is responsible for lobelia’s therapeutic effects.144 Lobelia has traditionally been used in combination with other botanical agents, such as Capsicum frutescens and Symphlocarpus factida.

<!-- chunk -->

## Capsicum frutescens

Experimental evidence has shown that capsaicin, cayenne pepper’s major active component, induces long-lasting desensitization of air- way mucosa to various mechanical and chemical irritants.145 This effect is probably due to capsaicin-induced depletion of substance P (which normally increases vascular permeability and flow) in the respi- ratory tract nerves. Substance P is an undecapeptide associated with “neurogenic inflammation” via a direct effect and a synergistic action with histamine on the peripheral nervous system.146 The respiratory

and gastrointestinal tracts have large numbers of substance P–con- taining neurons. Because of its location and physiological action, it is believed to play an important role in atopic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. Therefore depletion of substance P may be ben- eficial in these conditions.

## Zizyphi fructus

The jujube plum has been used extensively in Chinese medicine for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis.147 It contains 100 to nmol/g of cyclic-AMP (cAMP) per dry weight, a concentration 10 times greater than that of any other plant or animal tissue thus far reported in the literature.148 It also contains a beta-adrenergic receptor stimula- tor that raises cAMP levels. These experimental findings, in conjunction with Zizyphi’s long historical use, strongly support its clinical use.

## Allium Family

Onions and garlic inhibit lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenases, which generate TxA 2 , PGD 2 , and PGE 2 . 149 Oral pretreatment of guinea pigs (that were sensitized to ovalbumin) with 1 mL of an alcohol/onion extract markedly reduced the asthmatic response to allergen inha- lation challenges. Onion contains quercetin, which may account for some of its pharmacological effect,150 but the major protective actions appear to be related to its content of benzyl and other isothiocyanates (mustard oils).151 Although the mechanism of action is unknown, it has been suggested that it is due to the inhibition of the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites.

## Tylophora asthmatica

The leaves of Tylophora asthmatica have been used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine in asthma and other respiratory tract disorders. The mode of action of Tylophora is unknown but is thought to be due to the alkaloids, especially tylophorine, which have been reported to possess antihistamine and antispasmodic activity, as well as inhibition of mast-cell degranulation.152,153 However, a more central mechanism may be responsible for the clinical effects in asthma. Several double-blind clinical studies have shown Tylophora to be beneficial for asthma.154–157 In one study of 135 patients, those given 200 mg of Tylophora leaves twice daily for 6 days demonstrated improvements in symptoms and respiratory function during the treat- ment period and for up to 2 weeks after treatment.154 In another double-blind study of 103 patients, those receiving mg of the dry alcoholic extract of Tylophora indica daily for only days demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms of asthma compared with a placebo group.156 At the end of the first week, 56% had complete to moderate improvement, compared with 31.6% of the 92 patients receiving the placebo. At the end of 4 weeks, the respec- tive figures were 32% and 23.8%; at 8 weeks, 23.8% and 8.4%; and at 12 weeks, 14.8% and 7.2%. The incidence of side effects such as nau- sea, partial diminution of taste for salt, and slight mouth soreness was 16.3% in the Tylophora group and 6.6% in the placebo group. These results, as well as the results from an additional study, indicate that the benefits of Tylophora are short-lived.157,158

## Ginkgo biloba

G. biloba contains several unique terpene molecules known collectively as ginkgolides that antagonize platelet-activating factor (PAF), a key chemical mediator in asthma, inflammation, and allergies. Ginkgolides compete with PAF for binding sites and inhibit the various events induced by PAF. The antiasthmatic effects of orally administered or inhaled ginkgolides have been shown to produce improvements in respiratory function and to reduce bronchial reactivity in several double-blind studies.158,159 Treatment consisted of 120 mg of the pure ginkgolides daily—a dosage that is currently expensive to achieve using the 24% ginkgo flavonglycoside and 6% total terpenoid G. biloba extract.

## Aloe vera

In one study, the oral administration of an extract of Aloe vera for months was shown to produce good results in the treatment of asthma in some individuals of various ages.160 The extract was produced from the supernatant of fresh leaves stored in the dark at 4°C for 7 days. Subjecting the leaves to dark and cold results in an increase in the polysaccharide fraction. One gram of the crude extract obtained from leaves stored in a cold, dark environment produced 400 mg of neu- tral polysaccharide, compared with only 30 mg produced from leaves not subjected to cold or dark. The dosage was 5 mL of a 20% solution of the A. vera extract in saline twice daily for 24 weeks, and 11 of patients (40%) without corticosteroid dependence felt better at the study’s conclusion. The mechanism of action is thought to be via res- toration of protective mechanisms, followed by augmentation of the immune system.

## Coleus forskohlii

Coleus forskohlii extracts may be particularly useful in asthma because increasing intracellular levels of cAMP result in relaxation of bronchial muscles and relief of respiratory symptoms. Forskolin has been shown to have remarkable effects in relaxing constricted bronchial muscles in patients with asthma (see Chapter 69).161,162 These studies used inhaled doses of pure forskolin. Whether orally administered forskolin in the form of C. forskohlii extract would produce similar bronchodilatory effects has yet to be determined. However, on the basis of the plant’s historic use and additional mechanisms of action, it appears likely.

## Boswellia

The Indian Ayurvedic botanical Boswellia is known for its ability to inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis.163 In one double-blind, placebo-con- trolled study, bronchial asthma was reduced in 70% of 40 patients treated with gum resin at 300 mg three times daily for 6 weeks, whereas only 27% of the control group improved. The disappearance of phys- ical symptoms and signs such as dyspnea and rhonchi; fewer attacks; increased FEV 1 , vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFRs); and decreased eosinophilia counts and sedimentation rates were recorded as measures of improvement.163

## Acupuncture and Acupressure

In traditional Chinese medicine, chronic asthmatic symptomatology is usually characterized as a lung or spleen deficiency. This model con- siders that acute symptoms may be caused by environmental invasion from cold wind (environmental factors) or an internal condition stem- ming from a lung heat condition (increased inflammation and eosin- ophilia). Chronic asthma is considered more of a weakness in the lung itself or a weakness of the spleen, which is responsible for nourishing the lung qi (or vitality). In traditional Chinese medicine, the emotion of grief is also said to weaken lung qi. In one prospective randomized study of patients with chronic asthma, 41 patients with chronic obstructive asthma were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture in addition to standard care, acupres- sure and standard care, or standard care alone. For each subject, acupuncture treatments were given, and self-administered acupres- sure was performed daily for 8 weeks. On the St. George’s Respiratory

## 1129CHAPTER 148 Asthma

Questionnaire, the acupuncture subjects showed an average 18.5-fold improvement, whereas the improvement for the acupressure-only subjects was 6.57-fold. Additionally, for patients who received acu- pressure, the irritability domain score exhibited an 11.8-fold improve- ment.164 Another study involved 44 patients receiving bona fide or sham acupressure. They received five treatments per week lasting minutes each for 4 weeks. Using pulmonary function and dyspnea scores, 6-minute walking distance measurements, and State Anxiety Scale scores, the acupressure group had significant improvements in breathing and less anxiety compared with those of the sham group.165


The effective treatment of asthma requires the consideration and con- trol of many aspects. In particular, the specific underlying defects and initiating factors must be determined because many different defects and metabolic abnormalities result in the same clinical picture of asthma. The development of an appropriate treatment plan includes the following five steps: 1. Determining and rectifying the underlying defect that allows the development of sensitization 2. Determining and balancing the underlying metabolic defect that causes an excessive inflammatory response 3. Finding potential allergens and developing a lifestyle, diet, and environment that allow the allergens to be avoided 4. Modulating the inflammatory process to limit the severity of the response 5. Preparing an effective treatment for the bronchoconstriction of the acute attack

## Environment

The most important preventative measures are to decrease exposure through decreased pollution in the work and home environments, the use of airway protection during the most-exposed work tasks, and ces- sation of smoking. Airborne allergens such as pollen, dander, and dust mites166 are often difficult to avoid entirely, but measures can be taken to reduce exposure. Eliminating dogs, cats, carpets, rugs, upholstered furniture, and other surfaces where allergens can collect is a great first step. Also, methods to discourage the presence of dust mite and cock- roach antigen should be used, although pesticide exposure should be minimized. If environmental exposures cannot be controlled entirely, make sure that the bedroom is as allergy-proof as possible. Have the patient encase the mattress in an allergen-proof plastic; wash sheets, blankets, pillowcases, and mattress pads every week; consider using bedding material made from Ventflex, a special hypoallergenic syn- thetic material; and install an air purifier. The best mechanical air purifiers are high-efficiency particulate-arresting filters that can be attached to central heating and air-conditioning systems. These units are available from suppliers of heating and air-conditioning units. Environmental chemicals around the home should be removed. These include paints, solvents, new furniture, chemical cleaners, and scented candles/air fresheners, to name a few. Building materi- als containing formaldehyde (e.g., carpeting, cabinetry) should also be avoided. Perfume, cologne, hair spray, lotions, antiperspirant, and scented soaps and shampoos often contain several chemicals that should be avoided. Water-damaged buildings must be repaired, and all mold, bacte- rial, and other organism growth must be addressed by professionals experienced in mold remediation.


Organic, mostly plant-based foods should be consumed when possible. Any foods known to cause adverse reactions should also be avoided. Elimination of the offending foods and incorporation of an oligoan- tigenic diet are primary in reducing inflammation. Elimination diets have been successful in identifying allergens and treating asthma, espe- cially in infants. The patient who has many food allergies may have to use a 4-day rotation diet. In the early stages of treatment, mild dietary tryptophan reduction should be useful but is not critical unless there is a metabolic defect in tryptophan metabolism. Garlic and onions should be used liberally unless the patient reacts to them. If the patient is willing or his or her asthma is unresponsive to this recommended therapy, a vegan diet should be tried (for a minimum of 4 months), with the possible exception of coldwater fish. Moderate fruit consump- tion, especially of apples, should also be encouraged.


• Vitamin B 6 : 25 to 50 mg two times a day • Vitamin B 12 : 1000 mcg/day (oral) or weekly injection; evaluate for efficacy after 6 weeks • Vitamin C: 10 to 30 mg/kg in divided dosages • Vitamin D: 1000 to 8000 IU daily. Monitor blood levels to deter- mine needed dosage because there is wide variability. Those whose blood levels do not rise in response to supplementation should have their 1,25(OH)2D 3 checked. Also, Vitamin K 2 should always be prescribed with Vitamin D. • Vitamin E: 100 to 200 IU daily • Magnesium: 200 to 400 mg three times a day • Quercetin: 400 mg 20 minutes before meals or enzymatically mod- ified isoquercitrin (EMIQ) 100 mg daily. • Grape seed extract (95% PCO content) or pine bark extract (e.g., Pycnogenol): 150 to 300 mg daily • Lycopene: 30 to 45 mg/day • Selenium: 200 mcg/day

# IN ACUTE ATTACK

An acute asthma attack can be a medical emergency. If necessary, the patient should be referred to an emergency department immediately. There are two more natural approaches that can be considered, but research support is only anecdotal. Intravenous (IV) magnesium can quickly relieve bronchial spasm. This should only be done by those with proper training and facilities. Dr. Bastyr recommended an herbal protocol using 1 tsp every 15 minutes of a tincture containing equal parts capsicum, lobelia, and skunk cabbage, which the senior edi- tor found consistently effective. Before prescribing, practitioners are advised to try this intense intervention themselves first. If the patient does not immediately respond to either of these two interventions, then emergency intervention is required.

nitrogen species, impaired repair processes, metal toxicity, hyper- homocysteinemia, and inhibition of either nitric oxide production or availability). 2. Once the endothelial cells have been sufficiently damaged, sites of injury become more permeable to plasma constituents, especially lipoproteins. The binding of lipoproteins to GAGs leads to a break- down in the integrity of the ground substance matrix and causes an increased affinity for cholesterol. Simultaneously, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and platelets adhere to the damaged area, where they release growth factors that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate from the media into the intima and replicate. 3. Local concentration of lipoproteins, monocytes, and platelets leads to the migration of smooth muscle cells from the media into the intima, where they undergo proliferation. Smooth muscle cells dump cellular debris into the intima, leading to the further devel- opment of plaque. 4. Formation of a fibrous cap (consisting of collagen, elastin, and GAGs) over the intimal surface occurs. Fat and cholesterol deposits accumulate. 5. Plaque continues to grow until eventually it either blocks the artery directly or ruptures to form a clot that travels the general circula- tion until it occludes a blood vessel. Plaque instability is associated with a significantly greater risk for myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.1 Thus targeting plaque stabilization appears to be more clin- ically important than simply enlarging the lumen.

## Causative Factors

Prevention of CVD involves reducing and, when possible, eliminating various risk factors (Fig. 149.1). Risk factors are divided into two pri- mary categories: major risk factors and other risk factors. Box 149.1 lists the major risk factors. Risk for a heart attack increases with the number of major risk factors (Table 149.1). In addition to these well-accepted major risk factors, numerous others have occasionally been shown to be more significant (Box 149.2). It is also important to develop a strategic approach to plaque stabilization by addressing endothelial dysfunction, increased local and systemic inflammation, increased reactive oxygen species, the acti- vation of mast cells, and the infiltration and activation of macrophages.

## Determining a Patient’s Risk

To help determine a patient’s overall risk for having a heart attack or stroke, the following risk-determinant scale may prove useful. Although this risk assessment does not take into consideration several other important factors—such as the level of C-reactive protein, lipo- protein(a)[Lp(a)], fibrinogen, and coping style—the score provides a good indication of a patient’s risk for a heart attack or stroke (Table 149.2).

## Smoking

Statistical evidence reveals smokers have a 70% greater risk of death from CVD than nonsmokers.2 The more cigarettes smoked and the longer the period of years a person has smoked, the greater the risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke. Overall, the average smoker dies to 8 years sooner than the nonsmoker. Tobacco smoke contains more than 4000 chemicals, of which more than 50 have been identified as carcinogens. These chemicals are extremely damaging to the cardiovascular system.

chemicals are carried in the bloodstream on LDL cholesterol where they either directly damage the lining of the arteries, or they oxidize the LDL molecule, which then damages the arteries. Exposure of human plasma to the gas phase of cigarette smoke produces oxLDL which strongly correlates with cardiovascular disease. An elevated cholesterol level makes the effect of smoking on the cardiovascular system even worse because more cigarette toxins will be carried through the vascu- lar system. Smoking also contributes to elevated cholesterol presum- ably by damaging feedback mechanisms in the liver that control how much cholesterol is being created.3 Smoking promotes platelet aggre- gation and elevated fibrinogen levels, two other significant indepen- dent risk factors for heart disease and strokes. In experimental models, PAHs found in the tar fraction of cigarette smoke have been shown to accelerate atherosclerosis.4 In addition, cigarette smoking is a contrib- uting factor to high blood pressure.5 Convincing evidence links environmental (secondhand or passive) smoke to heart disease mortality and morbidity. In the United States it is estimated that more than 37,000 coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths each year are attributable to environmental smoke. Meta-analysis of ten epidemiological studies indicates a consistent dose–response effect related to exposure.6 Individuals exposed to secondhand smoke have higher homocysteine and fibrinogen (biomarkers of cardiovas- cular disease risk) levels than nonsmokers.7 Evidence suggests that nonsmokers appear to be more sensitive to smoke, including its del- eterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Environmental tobacco smoke actually has a higher concentration of some toxic constituents. Pathophysiological and biochemical data after short- and long-term environmental tobacco smoke exposure show changes in the lining of the arteries and in platelet function as well as exercise capacity, similar to those in active smoking. Passive smoking is a relevant risk factor for CVD. The magnitude of risk reduction achieved by smoking cessation in patients with CVD is quite significant. Results from a detailed meta-analysis showed a 36% reduction in relative risk of mortality for patients with CAD who quit compared with those who continued smoking.8 Various measures, including nicotine-containing skin patches or chewing gum, acupuncture, and hypnosis, have been shown to pro- vide some benefit in helping patients quit smoking. In a systematic review of the efficacy of interventions intended to help people to stop smoking, data were analyzed from 188 randomized controlled tri- als.9 Encouragement to stop smoking by physicians during a routine office call resulted in a 2% cessation rate after 1 year. Supplementary measures such as follow-up letters or visits had an additional effect. Behavioral modification techniques such as relaxation, rewards and punishments, and avoiding trigger situations in group or individual sessions led by a psychologist had no greater effect than the 2% rate achieved by simple advice from a physician. Eight studies with acu- puncture have produced an overall effectiveness rate of roughly 3%. Hypnosis has been judged to be ineffective, even though trials have shown a success rate of 23%. Hypnosis was judged to be ineffective because no biochemical marker was used to accurately determine effectiveness. Nicotine replacement therapy (gum or patch) is effective in about 13% of smokers who seek help in quitting. All together, these results are not encouraging. It appears that the best results occur when people quit “cold turkey.” Box 149.4 lists 10 tips to help patients stop smoking.

## Elevated Blood Cholesterol Levels

The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that elevated cholesterol levels greatly increase the risk of death due to CVD. It is recommended that the total blood cholesterol level should be less than 200 mg/dL. In

## 1134SECTION 6 Diseases

addition, it is recommended that the LDL-C should be less than mg/dL, the high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) should be greater than 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women, and the tri- glyceride level should be less than 150 mg/dL. Keep in mind, however, that except at very high levels, cholesterol is not the culprit but rather an indirect measure of oxLDL which is the culprit. Cholesterol is transported in the blood by lipoproteins. The major categories of lipoproteins are very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL, and HDL. Because VLDL and LDL are responsible for transport- ing fats (primarily triglycerides and cholesterol) from the liver to body cells, whereas HDL is responsible for returning fats to the liver, ele- vations of either VLDL or LDL are associated with an increased risk for developing atherosclerosis, the primary cause of a heart attack or stroke. In contrast, elevations of HDL-C are associated with a lower risk of heart attacks. The ratios of total cholesterol to HDL-C and LDL-C to HDL-C are referred to as the cardiac risk factor ratios because they reflect whether cholesterol is being deposited into tissues or broken down and excreted. The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C should be no higher than 4.2, and the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C should be no higher than 2.5. The risk of heart disease can be reduced dramatically by lowering LDL-C while simultaneously raising HDL-C levels. For every 1% drop in the LDL-C level, the risk of a heart attack drops by 2%. Conversely, for every 1% increase in HDL-C level, the risk for a heart attack drops by 3% to 4%.10

## Further refinement of determining risk. Although LDL-C is

referred to as “bad cholesterol,” some forms are worse than others. For example, oxidized LDL-C is a persistent proinflammatory trigger for the progression of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture and highly predictive of cardiovascular disease. LDL-C molecules of higher density are associated with greater risk than larger, less dense molecules. Small, dense LDL-C has a greater content of apolipoprotein CIII (apo CIII); in addition, apoB particles are more atherogenic than larger, less dense LDL-Cs and are markers for CVD risk.11 In a small trial of nondiabetic subjects, researchers determined that these smaller particles were more heavily and preferentially glycated over the larger, more buoyant LDL-C particles, strongly suggesting an explanation for why these particles are more likely to participate in atherogenesis and highlighting the importance of avoiding hyperglycemia and excessive glycation.12 Another marker that deserves mention is Lp(a), a plasma lipopro- tein whose structure and composition closely resemble those of LDL-C but with an additional molecule of an adhesive protein called apoli- poprotein(a). Elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) are an independent risk factor for CHD, particularly in those patients with elevated LDL-C lev- els. In one analysis, a high level of Lp(a) was shown to carry with it a ten times greater risk for heart disease than an elevated LDL-C level.13 That is because LDL-C alone lacks the adhesive apolipoprotein(a). As a result, LDL-C does not easily stick to the walls of the artery. An ele- vated LDL-C level carries less risk than a normal or even low LDL-C combined with an elevated Lp(a). Levels of Lp(a) below 20 mg/dL are associated with a low risk of heart disease; levels between 20 and 40 mg/ dL are associated with a moderate risk; and levels above 40 mg/dL are associated with an extremely high risk of heart disease.

## Elevations of triglycerides. A large body of accumulating

evidence indicates that hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is an independent risk factor for CVD. Multivariate analysis of 8-year follow-up data from the large-scale Prospective Cardiovascular Munster Study found HTG to be an independent risk factor for major coronary events after controlling for LDL-C and HDL-C.14 HTG combined with elevated LDL-C and a high LDL-C:HDL-C (>5) increased the risk for a CHD event by approximately sixfold. A large meta-analysis of 17 prospective trials reported that an 88 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) increase in plasma triglyceride levels significantly increased the relative risk of CVD by approximately 30% in men and 75% in women. The corresponding rates were somewhat lower (14% and 37%, respectively) but still statistically significant after adjustment for HDL-C level.15 This increased risk is mediated through the metabolic interrela- tionships between serum triglyceride (TG) levels and other risk factors, such as the atherogenic lipid profile (low HDL-C levels and elevated small dense LDL levels), insulin resistance, a prothrombotic propen- sity, and low-grade systemic inflammation. TG-lowering strategy in patients with HTG is an important clinical goal in reducing the risk of not only atherosclerosis but also the metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

## Inherited elevations of cholesterol and triglycerides. Elevations

of blood cholesterol, triglycerides, or both can be due to genetic factors. These conditions are referred to as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH), and familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG). Relatively speaking, these disorders are among the most common inherited diseases, affecting about 1 in every 500 people. The problem in FH is a defect in the receptor protein for LDL-C in the liver. Normally, the LDL-C receptor is responsible for removing cholesterol from the blood. When the liver cell takes up the LDL-C after it has bound to the receptor, it signals the liver cell to stop making cholesterol. In FH, the defect in the LDL-C receptor results in the liver not receiving the message to stop making cholesterol. Damage to the LDL-C receptor occurs with normal aging and in several disease states. Diabetes may be the most significant disease owing to increased glycosylation of the receptor proteins. As a result of damage to the LDL-C receptor, cholesterol levels tend to rise with age. In addition, a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol decreases the number of LDL-C receptors, thereby reducing the feedback mech- anism that tells the liver cell to decrease cholesterol synthesis. Lifestyle and dietary changes can increase the function or number of LDL-C receptors or both. The most dramatic effects are in people without inherited causes of elevated cholesterol or triglycerides or both, but even people with FH can benefit. FCH and FHTG result in defects that are similar to those of FH. In FCH, the basic defect appears to be an accelerated production of VLDL

in the liver. These individuals may have only a high blood triglyceride level, only a high cholesterol level, or both. In FHTG, there is only an elevation in blood triglyceride levels, and HDL-C levels tend to be low. The defect in FHTG is that VLDL particles made by the liver are larger than normal and carry more triglycerides. FHTG is aggravated by dia- betes, gout, and obesity.

## Diabetes

Atherosclerosis is one of the key underlying factors in the development of many chronic complications of diabetes. Individuals with diabetes have a twofold to threefold higher risk of dying prematurely of heart disease or stroke than persons who do not have diabetes, and 55% of deaths in patients with diabetes are caused by CVD. However, even mild insulin resistance and poor glucose control have both been shown to have a dramatic effect on the incidence and progression of CVD. For more information, see Chapter 165.

## Elevated Blood Pressure

Elevated blood pressure is often a sign of considerable atherosclerosis and a major risk factor for heart attack or stroke. In fact, the presence of hypertension is generally regarded as the most significant risk factor for stroke. For more information, see Chapter 179.

## Physical Inactivity

Physical activity refers to “bodily movement produced by skeletal mus- cles that requires energy expenditure” and produces healthy benefits. Exercise, a type of physical activity, is defined as “a planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness.” Physical inactivity denotes a level of activity less than that needed to maintain good health. Physical inactivity characterizes most Americans, because roughly 54% of adults report little or no regular leisure physical activity, and there is also a sharp decline in regular exercise among children and adolescents.1 Physical activity protects against the development of CVD and favorably modifies other CVD risk factors, including high blood pres- sure, blood lipid levels, insulin resistance, and obesity. Physical activity is also important in the treatment and management of patients with CVD or increased risk including those who have hypertension, stable angina, a prior MI, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, or who are recovering from a cardiovascular event.

## Environmental Toxins

## Particulate matter. Cumulative epidemiological and experimental

data have shown that exposure to air pollutants leads to increased cardiovascular ischemic events and enhanced atherosclerosis. In approximately 43 million adults from the APHEA2 (Air Pollution and Health: A European Approach) study, it was found that daily cardiovascular mortality increased 1.5% for every μ g/m3 increase in PM 10 .16 Ultrafine particles (<0.18 μ m) enhance early atherosclerosis, partly due to their high content in redox cycling chemicals and their ability to synergize with known proatherogenic mediators in the promotion of tissue oxidative stress as well as through alterations of the anti-inflammatory function of plasma HDL (Fig. 149.2).17 PM 2.5 levels are also positively associated with increases in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). A study of 798 residents of the Los Angeles area found that for each μ g/m3 of PM 2.5 , CIMT increased by 5.9%.18 Those patients on lipid-lowering agents had almost triple the increase in CIMT (15.8%) for each μ g/m3 rise in PM 2.5 , and in women over the age of 60, CIMT increased an average of 19.2%.

## Other Risk Factors

In addition to the major risk factors for CVD (e.g., smoking, elevations in cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, diabetes, and physical inactiv- ity/obesity), a number of other factors have, on occasion, been shown to be more significant. See Box 149.2 for a list of several of the more than 300 different risk factors that have been identified. Although there is considerable evidence that all these risk factors can play significant roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, much of the research has focused on the central roles of inflammatory pro- cesses and insulin resistance.25 Inflammatory mediators influence many stages of atheroma development, from initial leukocyte recruit- ment to eventual rupture of the unstable atherosclerotic plaque. In par- ticular, C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant that reflects different degrees of inflammation, has been identified as an indepen- dent risk factor for CAD. Although the CRP level has been shown to be a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than the LDL-C level, screening for both biological markers provides better prognostic infor- mation than screening for either alone.26 Elevations in CRP are closely linked to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.27 The diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syn- drome comprise the presence of at least three of the following meta- bolic risk factors in one person: • Central obesity (a waist-to-hip ratio >1 for men and >0.8 for women) • Atherogenic dyslipidemia (mainly triglycerides >150 mg/dL and low HDL-C [<40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women]) • Hypertension ( ≥ 130/85 mm Hg) • Insulin resistance or glucose intolerance (fasting blood sugar levels >101 mg/dL or HbA 1c 5.7%–6.4%) • Prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor in the blood) • Proinflammatory state (e.g., elevated high-sensitivity CRP in the blood) The metabolic syndrome has become increasingly common in the United States, affecting more than 60 million U.S. adults. Insulin

resistance and metabolic syndrome are closely tied to obesity (partic- ularly abdominal obesity), elevations in CRP, and a significant risk for CAD.

# THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS—GENERAL

# GUIDELINES

Prevention of a heart attack or stroke involves reducing risk factors. The major risk factor of smoking was discussed earlier, and obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and hypertension are detailed in separate chapters. Significant evidence shows that simply adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle dramatically reduces CVD-related mortality. In a prospective trial enrolling more than 20,000 men and women, it was found that the combination of four healthy behaviors (nonsmoking, not physically inactive, moderate alcohol intake, and a plasma vita- min C indicative of at least 5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day) reduced total mortality fourfold compared with those who had none of these behaviors.28

## Diet—General Guidelines

The dietary program detailed in Chapter 44 features a comprehen- sive dietary approach for both the prevention and treatment of CVD as well as the improvement of blood lipid profiles. It is important to reduce the intake of saturated fat and trans fatty acids and to increase the consumption of vegetables, fruit, dietary fiber, monounsaturated fats, and omega-3 fatty acids. One important dietary goal is improv- ing the structure and composition of cell membranes by incorporat- ing essential structural components, such as monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids, and by preventing oxidative and free radical dam- age to these structures by consuming a high level of antioxidants and phytochemicals.

## Mediterranean Diet

One of the most widely studied dietary interventions in CAD is the tra- ditional “Mediterranean diet,”29 which reflects food patterns typical in some Mediterranean regions in the early 1960s. Unfortunately, the mod- ern Mediterranean diet has deviated significantly from its healthful origin. The original Mediterranean diet had the following characteristics: • Olive oil is the principal source of fat. • The diet centers on an abundance of plant food (fruits; potatoes, beans, and other vegetables; breads; pasta; nuts; and seeds). • Foods are minimally processed, and people focus on seasonally fresh and locally grown foods. • Fresh fruit is the typical daily dessert, with sweets containing con- centrated sugars or honey consumed only a few times a week at the most. • Dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt) are consumed daily in low to moderate amounts. • Fish is consumed regularly. • Poultry and eggs are consumed in moderate amounts (up to four times a week) or not at all. • Red meat is consumed in low amounts. • Wine is consumed in low to moderate amounts, normally with meals. In one study, the effect of the Mediterranean diet on endothelial function and vascular inflammatory markers was studied in patients with metabolic syndrome.30 Patients in the intervention group were instructed to follow the Mediterranean diet and received detailed advice on how to increase their daily consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and olive oil; patients in the control group followed the American Heart Association (AHA) diet.

ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. In comparison with patients consuming the control diet, patients consuming the intervention diet had significantly reduced serum concentrations of CRP and other inflammatory mediators, improved endothelial function, and greater weight loss. A study in elderly individuals analyzed the relationship between polyphenol intake from a Mediterranean diet and circulating inflam- matory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors.31 A total of high-risk participants were randomly assigned to a low-fat control diet or to two Mediterranean diets, supplemented with either extra vir- gin olive oil or nuts. Results showed increases in polyphenol intake measured as urinary total urinary polyphenol excretion (TPE) were associated with decreased inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of polyphenols. In addi- tion, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in parallel with increas- ing urinary TPE. Although several components of the Mediterranean diet deserve special mention, it is important to stress that the total benefits reflect an interplay among many beneficial compounds rather than any single factor.32 Although the consumption of seafood has been shown to have ben- eficial effects on cardiovascular risk, these benefits can be challenged by the toxic metal content of the seafood. A cross-sectional study explored the association of seafood consumption and its estimated toxic metal contents (arsenic [As], cadmium [Cd], mercury [Hg], and lead [Pb]) with the lipid profile and lipid oxidation biomarkers in adults from a Spanish Mediterranean area without risk factors for CVD.33 Researchers observed a mean seafood consumption of 74.9g per day (95% CI: 59.9–89.9), including 22.7g of shellfish per day (95% CI: 13.5–31.9) with moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The estimated toxic metal contents were: 21.12 μ g/kg per week As, 0.57 μ g/kg per week InAs, 0.15 μ g/kg per week Cd, 1.11 μ g/kg per week Hg and 0.28 μ g/kg per week Pb. An increase in shellfish consumption was associated with increases in the levels of LDLc, non-HDLc, APOB/A, and plasma oxLDL. The study authors concluded that in adults with- out risk factors for CVD, increasing shellfish consumption, even by a moderate amount, could favor a proatherogenic lipid profile and a higher level of oxidized LDL. In addition, it is critical to follow a low-glycemic diet. A prospective trial with more than 48,000 participants highlighted the importance of good glycemic control for preventing CVD. Following a study popula- tion for an average of 8 years, researchers found that the consumption of foods with a high glycemic load increased the risk of CHD in women by 68%; women in the highest glycemic-load quartile had a relative risk of 2.2 for CHD compared with those in the lowest quartile.34

## Olive Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

One of the most important aspects of the Mediterranean diet may be the combination of olive oil (a source of monounsaturated fats and antioxidants) and the intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Olive oil consists not only of monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid), but also of several antioxidant agents that may also account for some of its health benefits. In addition to a mild effect in lowering LDL-C and triglycerides, olive oil increases the HDL-C level and helps prevent LDL-C from being damaged by free radicals.35 Bioactive compounds in olive oil have also been shown to exhibit a potent capability to attenuate oxidative stress and improve endothelial function through their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic proper- ties, therefore reducing the risk and progression of atherosclerosis.36 Ironically, olive oil has often been inappropriately used as the placebo in trials of fish oils. In addition to olive oil, the benefits of the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for cardiovascular health has been demonstrated in more than 300 clinical trials. These fatty acids exert considerable benefits in reducing the risk for CVD. Supplementation with EPA and DHA has little effect on cholesterol levels but does lower triglyceride levels significantly, as well as producing myriad additional beneficial effects, including reduced platelet aggregation; improved endothelial function and arterial flexibility; improved blood and oxygen supply to the heart; and a mild effect in lowering blood pressure by vasodilation and pro- motion of sodium excretion.37 The levels of EPA and DHA within red blood cells have been shown to be highly significant predictors of heart disease and is known as the omega-3 index. An omega-3 index of 8% is associated with the greatest protection, whereas an index of 4% is associated with the least protection. In one analysis, the omega-3 index was shown to be the most significant predictor of CAD compared with CRP; total choles- terol, LDL-C, or HDL-C; and homocysteine. Researchers subsequently determined that a total of a combined 1000 mg of EPA and DHA daily is required to achieve or surpass the 8% target of the omega-3 index.38,39 The findings with the omega-3 index are not surprising, because a wealth of information has documented a clear relationship between dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and the likelihood of developing CHD: the higher the omega-3 fatty acid intake, the lower the likelihood of CHD. It has been estimated that raising the levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids through diet or supplementation may reduce over- all cardiovascular mortality by as much as 45%.40,41 In general, for preventive effects against CVD, the dosage rec- ommendation is 1000 mg of EPA plus DHA a day; for lowering tri- glycerides, the dosage is 3000 mg. In a double-blind study, after weeks of supplementation, a daily dosage of 3.4 g EPA plus DHA low- ered triglycerides by 27%, but a lower dosage of 0.85 g had no effect. These results clearly indicate that the effective dosage for lowering tri- glycerides with fish oils requires dosages of 3 g EPA plus DHA a day.42 In comparison with other triglyceride-lowering therapies, EPA has been found to inhibit cholesterol crystal formation, inflammation, and oxidative modification of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, thus inter- fering with the mechanisms of atherosclerosis, resulting in reduced numbers of cardiovascular events.43 Although the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids exert more pro- nounced effects than alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the shorter omega-3 fatty acid from vegetable sources, it is important to point out that the two populations with the lowest rates of heart attack have a relatively high intake of ALA: the Japanese population who inhabits Kohama Island and the inhabitants of Crete.44,45 Typically, Cretans have a threefold higher serum concentration of ALA than members of other European countries, owing to their frequent consumption of walnuts and the vegetable purslane.44 Of course, another important dietary fac- tor in both the Kohamans and Cretans is their use of oleic acid–con- taining oils. However, although the oleic acid content of their diets offers some degree of protection, the rates of heart attack among the Kohamans and Cretans are much lower than rates in populations that consume only oleic acid sources and little ALA. The intake of ALA is viewed as a more significant protective factor than oleic acid.

## Nuts and Seeds

Higher consumption of nuts and seeds has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of CVD in large epidemiological studies including the Nurses’ Health Study, the Iowa Health Study, and the Physicians’ Health Study.46 Researchers estimate that substituting nuts for an equivalent amount of carbohydrates in an average diet resulted in a

<!-- chunk -->

## 1138SECTION 6 Diseases

30% reduction in heart disease risk. Researchers calculated an even more impressive risk reduction, 45%, when fat from nuts was substi- tuted for saturated fats (found primarily in meat and dairy products). Nuts have a cholesterol-lowering effect, which partly explains this ben- efit, but they are also a rich source of arginine. By increasing nitric oxide levels, arginine may help to improve blood flow, reduce blood clot formation, and improve blood fluidity (i.e., the blood becomes less viscous and therefore flows through blood vessels more easily). Walnuts appear to be especially beneficial because they are also a rich source of both antioxidants and ALA. In one study, hypercholes- terolemic men and women were randomized to a cholesterol-lower- ing Mediterranean diet and a diet of similar energy and fat content in which walnuts replaced approximately 32% of the energy from mono- unsaturated fat (olive oil). Participants followed each diet for 4 weeks. In comparison with the Mediterranean diet, the walnut diet improved endothelial cell function (i.e., it increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reduced levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). The walnut diet also significantly reduced total cholesterol (–4.4%) and LDL-C (–6.4%).47

## Vegetables, Fruits, and Red Wine

An important contributor to the benefits noted with the Mediterranean diet is the focus on carotene- and flavonoid-rich fruits, vegetables, and beverages (e.g., red wine). Numerous population studies have repeatedly demonstrated that a higher intake of dietary antioxidants significantly reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke. Higher blood levels of antioxidant nutrients are also associated with lower levels of CRP.48 Two valuable sources of antioxidants in the Mediterranean diet are tomato products and red wine. Tomatoes are a rich source of the car- otene lycopene. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of supplementing tomato and lycopene on CV risk factors and determined that the available evidence supports the view that increas- ing the intake of these has positive effects on blood lipids, blood pres- sure, and endothelial function.49 In large clinical studies evaluating the relationship between carotene status and heart attack (acute MI), lycopene but not beta-carotene was shown to be protective. Lycopene exerts greater antioxidant activity compared with beta-carotene in general but specifically against LDL-C oxidation.50 The cardiovascular protection offered by red wine is popularly referred to as the “French paradox.” Because the French population consumes more saturated fat than people in the United States and the United Kingdom do yet have a lower incidence of heart disease, red wine consumption has been suggested to be the reason. Presumably this protection is the result of flavonoids and other polyphenols in red wine that protect against oxidative damage to LDL-C as well as help reduce the levels of inflammatory mediators.30,51 Moderate alcohol consumption alone has also been shown to be protective in some stud- ies by exerting positive effects on ratios of HDL-C to LDL-C and CRP as well as levels of fibrinogen, although red wine typically exerts the most significant effects.52 Importantly, the effects of alcohol on CVD risk, morbidity, and total mortality are counterbalanced by alcohol’s addictive and psycho- logical effects. The major benefits of red wine consumption in protecting against CVD may ultimately be the effects that the polyphenols have on improving endothelial cell function. In one study, 30 male patients with CHD were randomly assigned to take a red grape polyphenol extract (600 mg) or placebo. Flow-mediated dilation was measured after fasting and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after intake of the grape extract or placebo. The intake of the red grape polyphenol extract caused an increase in flow-mediated dilation, peaking at 60 minutes, which was significantly higher than the baseline values and the corre- sponding values at 60 minutes after the intake of placebo (4.52% vs. 2.64%).53 The consumption of green tea, like that of red wine, has also been shown in population studies to be associated with a reduced risk for CVD. As with red wine, much of the benefit of green tea consumption may be the result of several different mechanisms, including improv- ing endothelial cell function. Green tea polyphenols (catechins) have been shown to decrease the oxidation of LDL-C, lower LDL-C levels, and improve the LDL-C:HDL-C ratio. In vitro studies have shown a dose-dependent response with green tea polyphenols in reducing sev- eral biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis and ischemia, includ- ing the inhibition of the endothelial cell–derived vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 as well as angiotensin II, platelet derived growth factor-BB, apolipoprotein E, and inducible nitric oxide synthase.54 Another mechanism of action for red wine and green tea polyphe- nols involves inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels within the vascular lesion. During the angiogenic process, new blood vessels develop from the existing microvascular bed. The initial event involves dilation of an existing blood vessel followed by an increase in vascular permeability and the degradation of extracellular matrices. This pro- cess allows endothelial cells to migrate into the lesion and proliferate, and these events are followed by the maturation of new blood vessels. The angiogenic process is controlled by two major proangiogenic factors: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade extracel- lular matrices, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which strongly stimulates endothelial cell migration and proliferation and the formation of new blood vessels. Both red wine and green tea polyphe- nols have been shown to inhibit this process in vitro at concentrations conceivably achievable with oral intake.54 Foods and beverages rich in antioxidant content have shown ben- efit in fighting atherosclerosis. Pomegranate (Punica granatum) juice appears to be particularly useful. It is remarkably rich in antioxidants, such as soluble polyphenols, tannins, and anthocyanins. Animal research has indicated that components of pomegranate juice can retard atherosclerosis, reduce plaque formation, and improve arterial health. Human clinical studies have supported the role of pomegranate juice in benefiting heart health.55–57 In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, the daily consumption of pomegranate juice for 3 months was evaluated for its effect on myocardial perfusion in 45 patients who had CHD and myocardial ischemia. Patients were randomly assigned into one of two groups: a pomegranate juice group (240 mL per day) or a pla- cebo group, who drank a beverage of similar caloric content, amount, flavor, and color. Participants underwent electrocardiographic-gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomographic scintigraphy at rest and during stress at baseline and 3 months. After months, the extent of stress-induced ischemia decreased in the pome- granate group but increased in the control group. This benefit was observed without changes in cardiac medications, blood sugar, hemo- globin A 1c , weight, or blood pressure in either group.55 In another study, 10 patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) were evaluated to gauge the effect of pomegranate juice consumption on the progression of carotid lesions and changes in oxidative stress and blood pressure. The patients were supplemented with pome- granate juice (50 mL) for 1 year, and 5 patients continued for up to 3 years. In the control group (which did not consume pomegranate juice), common carotid intimal-medial thickness (IMT) increased by 9% during 1 year, whereas pomegranate juice consumption resulted in a significant IMT reduction, by up to 30%, after 1 year. In compar- ison with values obtained before pomegranate juice consumption, the patients’ serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) activity was increased by 83%,

whereas serum LDL-C basal oxidative state and LDL-C susceptibility to copper ion–induced oxidation were both significantly reduced, by 90% and 59%, respectively, after 12 months. Furthermore, serum lev- els of antibodies against oxidized LDL-C were decreased by 19%; in parallel, serum total antioxidant status was increased by 130% after year of pomegranate juice consumption. Systolic blood pressure was reduced after 1 year of pomegranate juice consumption by 21%. For all studied parameters, the maximal effects were observed after 1 year of pomegranate juice consumption.56

# THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS—LOWERING

# CHOLESTEROL

Lowering total cholesterol (TC), as well as LDL-C and triglycerides (TG), is clearly associated with reducing CVD risk. Most of the benefits noted with lowering LDL-C are based on a large number of randomized clinical trials involving the use of the HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors known collectively as statin drugs. Statins owe their origin to red yeast (Monascus purpureus) fermented on rice. This traditional Chinese medicine has been used for its health- promoting effects in China for more than 2000 years. Red yeast rice is the source of a group of compounds known as monacolins (e.g., lovas- tatin, also known as monacolin K, one of the key monacolins in red yeast rice extract). The marketing of an extract of red yeast fermented on rice standardized for monacolin content as a dietary supplement in the United States caused controversy in 1997, because this agent con- tained a natural source of a prescription drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) eventually ruled that red yeast rice products could be sold only if they were free of monacolin. Although the data are clear that statin drugs can produce decreases in total mortality, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures in high-risk patients, the debate remains whether statin therapy represents the optimal treatment approach to the primary prevention of CAD in patients with only the risk factor of elevated LDL-C, especially in light of the growing accep- tance of risk factors like CRP and the emerging role of nutrition.58,59 For example, one study compared the “portfolio diet,” comprising plant-based cholesterol-lowering foods, with lovastatin.60 The partic- ipants were randomly assigned to undergo one of three interventions on an outpatient basis for 1 month: a diet low in saturated fat, based on milled whole-wheat cereals and low-fat dairy foods; the same diet plus lovastatin, 20 mg per day; or a diet high in plant sterols (1 g/1000 kcal), soy protein (21.4 g/1000 kcal), viscous fibers (9.8 g/1000 kcal), and almonds (14 g/1000 kcal). The control, statin, and dietary port- folio groups had mean (SE) decreases in LDL-C of 8%, 30.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Respective reductions in CRP were 10%, 33.3%, and 28.2%. This study and subsequent studies showed that by diversi- fying the cholesterol-lowering components in the same dietary portfo- lio, the effectiveness of diet as a treatment of hypercholesterolemia was increased. Moreover, results comparable with those of a statin drug (with lipid-lowering effects similar to statins in terms of both LDL-C and size of LDL-C) were produced.61,62 Although individual dietary changes may produce benefit in improving blood lipids, the best clinical approach is to incorporate a broad-spectrum dietary approach that incorporates a wide array of dietary components shown to have a positive effect on lipid levels. For example, although a meta-analysis of 27 randomized controlled trials in which isolated soy protein supplementation was the only intervention demonstrated that soy protein supplementation was associated with a significant dose-dependent reduction in mean serum total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides, the effect shown (–5.26 mg/dL, –4.25 mg/dL, and –6.26 mg/dL, respectively) was less than when the soy protein was used in conjunction with other dietary interventions.63 In addition, the effects of isolated soy protein appear to be considerably less than those achieved by increasing soy food consumption in general. Much of the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy foods may relate more to the isoflavone and soluble fiber content than to the protein. In an earlier meta-analysis based more on soy protein intake from other sources in addition to soy protein isolate, reductions were much more signif- icant for total cholesterol (–23.2 mg/dL), LDL-C (–21.7 mg/dL), and triglycerides (–13.3 mg/dL) but still relatively modest from a clinical perspective.64 Although these results do support the recommendation to increase soy protein intake in the dietary approach to hypercholes- terolemia, given the relatively small effect of soy protein on lipids, it is imperative that other dietary recommendations also should be pro- moted, such as reducing the dietary intake of saturated fat, trans-fatty acids, and cholesterol, as well as increasing the dietary intake of mono- unsaturated fats, soluble fiber, and nuts. Despite research documenting the benefits of nonpharmacological approaches, it is unlikely that lowering LDL-C with statin drugs will be supplanted as the primary therapy in lipid management and the pre- vention of CAD at any time in the near future. In 2011 it was estimated that more than one of every six adults—nearly 40 million people—was taking a statin drug to lower LDL-C. Therefore the focus with many patients will be on the support of statin therapy. For example, it appears that individuals taking statin drugs must supplement with coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ). For the synthesis of cholesterol, not only is HMG-CoA reductase required, but CoQ10 is as well. Thus administration of these drugs might compromise the status of CoQ 10 by decreasing its synthe- sis. Even modest dosages of various statins have been shown to lower serum levels of CoQ 10 . Researchers have concluded that inhibition of CoQ 10 synthesis by statin drugs could explain the most commonly reported adverse effects, especially fatigue and muscle pain, as well as more serious side effects such as rhabdomyolysis.65,66 CoQ 10 supple- mentation in subjects on statin drugs has also been shown to reduce markers of oxidative damage. Statins are also gaining popularity as a prescription method to lower CRP. In one study, a group of 186 individuals with type 2 dia- betes was selected to receive 10 mg of atorvastatin (Lipitor), 80 mg of atorvastatin, or a placebo for 30 weeks. In individuals given placebo, CRP levels increased by 6.6%, decreased by 15% in the 10-mg group, and by 47% in the 80-mg group. In a study with pravastatin, 40 mg daily lowered CRP levels by 13%.67

significant, because with each 1% drop in serum cholesterol level, there is a 2% decrease in the risk of developing heart disease. One bowl of ready-to-eat oat bran cereal or oatmeal contains approximately 3 g of fiber. Although oatmeal’s fiber content (7%) is less than that of oat bran (15%–26%), it has been determined that the polyunsaturated fatty acids contribute as much to the cholesterol-lowering effects of oats as the fiber content. Although oat bran has a higher fiber content, oatmeal is higher in polyunsaturated fatty acids. In an effort to lower cholesterol with dietary fiber, patients should be encouraged to eat 35 g of fiber daily from fiber-rich foods, a full listing of which can be found in Chapter 132. Achieving higher fiber intake is associated not only with lower cholesterol levels but also with lower inflammatory mediators like CRP.72

## Natural Products to Lower Cholesterol Levels

In many cases, dietary therapy, although important, is not sufficient alone to reduce lipid levels to the desired ranges. Fortunately, several natural compounds can lower cholesterol levels and other significant risk factors for CAD. In fact, when all factors are considered (e.g., cost, safety, effectiveness), the natural alternatives presented here may offer significant advantages to the standard drug therapy.

## Niacin

Since the 1950s niacin (vitamin B 3 ) has been known to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol levels. In the 1970s the famed Coronary Drug Project demonstrated that niacin was the only cholesterol-low- ering agent to actually reduce overall mortality. Niacin typically lowers LDL-C levels by 16% to 23% and raises HDL-C levels by 20% to 33%. These effects, especially the effect on HDL-C, compare quite favorably with those of conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs.73,74 It is now known that niacin does much more than lower total cho- lesterol. Specifically, niacin has been shown to lower LDL-C, the more harmful Lp(a) lipoprotein, as well as triglyceride, CRP, and fibrinogen levels and simultaneously raise levels of beneficial HDL-C. Although niacin has demonstrated better overall results in reducing risk factors for CHD compared with other cholesterol-lowering agents, physicians are often reluctant to prescribe niacin. The reason is a widespread per- ception that niacin is difficult to work with because of the bothersome flushing of the skin associated with its use. In addition, because nia- cin is a widely available “generic” agent, no pharmaceutical company stands to generate the huge profits that the other lipid-lowering agents have brought them. As a result, niacin does not benefit from the inten- sive advertising that focuses on the statin drugs. Despite the advantages of niacin over other lipid-lowering agents, it accounts for less than 10% of all cholesterol-lowering prescriptions. Several studies have compared niacin with standard lipid-lowering drugs including the statin drugs. These studies have shown significant advantages for niacin. In the first published clinical study comprising 136 patients, niacin was compared with lovastatin directly in the fol- lowing groups of subjects: (1) those with LDL-C levels greater than mg/dL and CHD, (2) those with more than two CHD risk factors, (3) those with both elevated LDL-C levels and more than two CHD risk factors, (4) those with LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL and with- out CHD, and (5) those with fewer than two CHD risk factors.75 This controlled, randomized, open-label, 26-week study was performed at five lipid clinics. Patients were first placed on a 4-week diet run-in period, after which eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either lovastatin (20 mg per day) or niacin (1.5 g per day). On the basis of the LDL-C response and patient tolerance, the doses were sequentially increased to 40 and 80 mg per day of lovastatin or 3 and 4.5 g per day of niacin after 10 and 18 weeks of treatment, respectively. In the two patient groups, 66% of patients treated with lovastatin and 54% of patients treated with niacin underwent full dos- age titration. Table 149.4 shows the results. These results indicate that, although lovastatin produced a greater reduction in LDL-C, niacin provided better overall results despite the fact that fewer patients were able to tolerate a full dosage of niacin because of skin flushing. The percentage increase in HDL-C, a more significant indicator for CHD, was dramatically in favor of niacin (33% vs. 7%). Equally impressive was the percentage decrease in Lp(a) for niacin. Although niacin produced a 35% reduction in Lp(a) levels, lovastatin did not produce any effect. Niacin’s effect on Lp(a) in this study confirmed a previous study showing that niacin (4 g per day) reduced Lp(a) levels by 38%. Moreover, a subsequent study showed similar reductions in Lp(a) in patients with diabetes.76,77 Another comparative study evaluated the lipoprotein responses to niacin, gemfibrozil, and lovastatin in patients with normal total cho- lesterol levels but low levels of HDL-C.78 The first phase of the study compared lipoprotein responses with lovastatin and gemfibrozil in 61 middle-aged men with low levels of HDL-C. In the second phase, 37 patients agreed to take niacin; 27 patients finished this phase at a dose of 4.5 g per day. In the first phase, gemfibrozil therapy increased HDL-C levels by 10% and lovastatin did so by 6%. In the second phase, niacin therapy was shown to raise HDL-C by 30%. Another comparative study involved niacin versus atorvastatin (Lipitor).79 The average dosage was 3000 mg for niacin and 80 mg for atorvastatin. The patients selected had abnormal particle size of LDL-C in that the molecules were small and dense—these LDL-C molecules are considerably more atherogenic than larger, less dense LDL-Cs. The patients selected also had low levels (<40%) of a specific fraction of HDL-C associated with a greater protective effect than HDL-C alone. Although atorvastatin reduced total LDL-C levels substantially more than niacin, niacin was more effective in increasing LDL-C particle size and raising HDL-C and HDL2-C than atorvastatin (Table 149.5). Because taking niacin at higher dosages (e.g., ≥ 3000 mg) can impair glucose tolerance, many physicians have avoided niacin therapy in
