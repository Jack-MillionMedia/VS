### UltraMind Success Stories

<!-- chunk -->

## “I feel like a different person now and have so much energy. I am happy

<!-- chunk -->

## and grateful for life.”

<!-- chunk -->

### By the age of forty I was in a negative spiral downward, physically,

<!-- chunk -->

### emotionally, and mentally. For a type-A, successful attorney, this was difficult

<!-- chunk -->

### for me. I went through a number of tests, because my body hurt all over and felt

<!-- chunk -->

### like it was falling apart. My short-term memory was almost entirely gone.

<!-- chunk -->

### I developed a stammer and couldn’t find words anymore. My mind and body

<!-- chunk -->

### were failing so quickly that I believed I was developing both Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### rheumatoid arthritis. However, after seeing several specialists, my tests came

<!-- chunk -->

### back negative. I was at a point where I could only accomplish one thing a day,

<!-- chunk -->

### because I ran out of gas so easily. I struggled with depression for many years and

<!-- chunk -->

### during this time I became even more short-tempered, irritable, and

<!-- chunk -->

### unenthusiastic about life. I tried several times unsuccessfully to get off the

<!-- chunk -->

### medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, I was introduced to Dr. Hyman and decided to follow his advice.

<!-- chunk -->

### What I uncovered surprised me. My mitochondria weren’t functioning properly,

<!-- chunk -->

### my body was unable to detoxify, so the toxins were building up and I had serious

<!-- chunk -->

### heavy metal poisoning with mercury levels in the upper sixties, and my lead and

<!-- chunk -->

### uranium levels were also very high (normal levels of mercury in the urinary

<!-- chunk -->

### chelating test are below four). After going through his detoxification program,

<!-- chunk -->

### changing my diet, making lifestyle changes to reduce stress and handle it better,

<!-- chunk -->

### and eliminating the heavy metals, my mental clarity came back, my aches and

<!-- chunk -->

### pains went away, and I ended up losing forty pounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### I feel like a different person now and have so much energy. I am happy and

<!-- chunk -->

### grateful for life. My mind has changed and I can think clearly without being in a

<!-- chunk -->

### fog. Now the only medication I take is for my hypothyroidism. I enjoy my life,

<!-- chunk -->

### my husband, and my children so much more now. Thank you for saving my life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jackie Tepper

<!-- chunk -->

### Stamford, CT

<!-- chunk -->

## “She was normal again and wasn’t hitting or raging on her sister.”

<!-- chunk -->

### When both of my daughters were young, they witnessed their father collapse

<!-- chunk -->

### on the kitchen floor and die. Emma, who was three at the time, reacted the most.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even after attending bereavement groups and seeing counselors, I started to see

<!-- chunk -->

### her acting in ways that were not normal.

<!-- chunk -->

### She became extremely physical and full of rage. Digging her nails into me

<!-- chunk -->

### and hitting and kicking her sister constantly without remorse was an everyday

<!-- chunk -->

### experience. She had a difficult time socializing at school. Teachers wanted me to

<!-- chunk -->

### put her on medication, and doctors wanted to do brain scans. It wasn’t until I was

<!-- chunk -->

### introduced to Dr. Hyman that it all made sense.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Hyman thought that the stress from witnessing her father’s death

<!-- chunk -->

### knocked her immune system out of whack. After doing a series of tests we

<!-- chunk -->

### uncovered two very important keys to her emotional and psychological turmoil.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first was an overgrowth of bacteria and yeast in her gut. Dr. Hyman said it

<!-- chunk -->

### was the worst he had seen in a person who didn’t have any real gut symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second was an intolerance to gluten and dairy.

<!-- chunk -->

### After we treated the yeast overgrowth with antibiotics and got gluten and

<!-- chunk -->

### dairy out of her diet for two weeks, I couldn’t believe the transformation in my

<!-- chunk -->

### daughter. She was normal again and wasn’t hitting or raging on her sister. It

<!-- chunk -->

### wasn’t easy to make the transition and change the way we eat, but the difference

<!-- chunk -->

### was undeniable. If I would slip and feed her macaroni and cheese or the little

<!-- chunk -->

### yellow Goldfish, she would be bouncing off the walls. Her teachers cannot

<!-- chunk -->

### believe the huge improvement, and she isn’t seeing a therapist anymore.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lisa R (mother)

<!-- chunk -->

### Medford, NY

<!-- chunk -->

## “I didn’t fully understand how bad I felt, until I felt better.”

<!-- chunk -->

### For years my health was in decline. It got to the point where I felt like I had

<!-- chunk -->

### the flu all the time with a low-grade fever. I started gaining weight even though I

<!-- chunk -->

### wasn’t eating a lot, I had zero energy, and my social life suffered because I didn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### want to go anywhere or do anything after work except go home to lay on the

<!-- chunk -->

### couch. I took antidepressants and battled with chronic sinus infections.

<!-- chunk -->

### After going to every doctor I could see including an endocrinologist, all they

<!-- chunk -->

### would do is throw antibiotics at me or suggest surgery. For years I thought it was

<!-- chunk -->

### just the stress of graduate school until my family jumped in and voiced their

<!-- chunk -->

### concern, and committed to helping me get to the bottom of whatever it was that

<!-- chunk -->

### was making me feel so awful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, I met Dr. Hyman and after listening to my story he did a series of

<!-- chunk -->

### tests to uncover that I had severe mercury poisoning with levels at two hundred

<!-- chunk -->

### sixty (normal levels of mercury in the urinary chelating test are below four) and

<!-- chunk -->

### a significant thyroid imbalance. Going through his plan changed my life.

<!-- chunk -->

### The minute he told me about my mercury poisoning, I instantly had hope that

<!-- chunk -->

### I wasn’t going to feel lousy for the rest of my life. After time and with patience, I

<!-- chunk -->

### feel like myself again and I am happy to be here. I spent years feeling miserable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now, even the small things like my hair and skin feel like they used to. I didn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### fully understand how bad I felt, until I felt better. I am a walking testimony of

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Hyman’s work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kaki Martin

<!-- chunk -->

### Cambridge, MA

<!-- chunk -->

## “I felt foggy and thick—like I was thinking through a marshmallow.”

<!-- chunk -->

### All of my life I was very athletic, on the go, full of energy, and could sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### better than anyone I knew. Over the past twenty years I saw a steady decline,

<!-- chunk -->

### which I thought was due to aging until I started getting real scared.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first major concern was on a family bike ride when I physically couldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### hold the brakes. My hands and feet were not doing the things that I was telling

<!-- chunk -->

### them to do. After that experience and waking up every night with severe

<!-- chunk -->

### cramping, I knew something was wrong. But even the best neurologists and

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrinologists were telling me I was fine.

<!-- chunk -->

### I knew these symptoms weren’t normal. I felt foggy and thick—like I was

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking through a marshmallow. What I learned (which no doctor could tell me)

<!-- chunk -->

### is that the various systems in my body couldn’t eliminate the toxins I’d received

<!-- chunk -->

### from foods, the environment, and the amalgams in my fillings.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the toxins, my mercury levels were dangerously high, which

<!-- chunk -->

### compromised my immune system and compromised me neurologically. After

<!-- chunk -->

### going through Dr. Hyman’s program, detoxifying, removing my fillings, and

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating the mercury, I now have my life back (at least 90 percent given my

<!-- chunk -->

### age of forty-five). I sleep great again, have more focus, recently started a new

<!-- chunk -->

### business, competed in three triathlons last year, and, more important, I recognize

<!-- chunk -->

### me again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Natalie Karp

<!-- chunk -->

### Roslyn, NY

<!-- chunk -->

## “We didn’t know there was a fog until we started eliminating the heavy

<!-- chunk -->

## metals.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Up until two years of age, Jackson was developing at a normal level. He was

<!-- chunk -->

### up to twenty words, but suddenly started to regress. When we took him to see

<!-- chunk -->

### our pediatrician he was down to five words, three months later he couldn’t say

<!-- chunk -->

### one.

<!-- chunk -->

### After seeing a speech doctor and psychologists he was diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### pervasive development disorder, or autism. We knew we had to do something

<!-- chunk -->

### because he wasn’t getting any better. He was irritable and would throw tantrums

<!-- chunk -->

### all the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### It wasn’t until we discovered Dr. Hyman that we started to put the pieces of

<!-- chunk -->

### the puzzle together. After going through Dr. Hyman’s program we found that our

<!-- chunk -->

### son had several food allergies, heavy metal poisoning, and severe gut

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and imbalances in his gut bacteria as well as yeast overgrowth.

<!-- chunk -->

### After learning about this we changed his diet right away and within days of

<!-- chunk -->

### removing dairy we saw results. We saw more concentration. With the B


<!-- chunk -->

### supplements our son developed more verbal skills and was able to focus. What’s

<!-- chunk -->

### amazing is that we didn’t know there was a fog until we started eliminating the

<!-- chunk -->

### heavy metals (using chelation). After Jackson went through chelation he became

<!-- chunk -->

### much more alive, responsive, and verbal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marc R (father)

<!-- chunk -->

### New York, NY

<!-- chunk -->

## “His teachers told me he was like a completely different kid.”

<!-- chunk -->

### As a young child Clayton had trouble staying on task, was easily frustrated,

<!-- chunk -->

### and rarely slept through the night. Once school started and we had other children

<!-- chunk -->

### to compare him to, it became clear these issues were pronounced. We reluctantly

<!-- chunk -->

### had him repeat kindergarten, and sought the help of a local doctor who

<!-- chunk -->

### specialized in educational testing. When the results came back, we were left with

<!-- chunk -->

### a diagnosis of ADHD, but were given very few options other than medication to

<!-- chunk -->

### deal with it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the course of the next year he continued to struggle and we eventually

<!-- chunk -->

### made the decision to start him on medication. It worked well, but like all

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine it came with a high price. Evenings were a challenge, as he suffered

<!-- chunk -->

### through rebound effects. His appetite was poor and he continued to have trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### sleeping. His concentration at school was improved, but he often had sinus

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, complained of stomach problems, and frequently broke out in hives

<!-- chunk -->

### for reasons we couldn’t pin down.

<!-- chunk -->

### We took Clayton to Dr. Hyman and for the first time had real, understandable

<!-- chunk -->

### answers for what had been happening to our son. Problems with gluten, yeast,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mercury toxicity were all correctly identified. Through changes in diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional support we were able to address not only the attention issues but all of

<!-- chunk -->

### his other physical symptoms as well. For the first time in his life, Clayton

<!-- chunk -->

### became focused, his health improved, and he slept through the night. A few

<!-- chunk -->

### months later I noticed a striking improvement in his handwriting, which before

<!-- chunk -->

### had been all but illegible. His teachers told me he was like a completely different

<!-- chunk -->

### kid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly two years later, our son has fully embraced this new model of taking

<!-- chunk -->

### care of himself. He packs his own lunch, manages social situations where foods

<!-- chunk -->

### he is sensitive to are present, and makes choices that keep him consistently

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy. I am extremely grateful to Dr. Hyman for his knowledge and

<!-- chunk -->

### compassionate support during our family’s continued journey toward optimum

<!-- chunk -->

### health.

# INTRODUCTION TO

# THE ULTRAMIND SOLUTION

BY MARTHA HERBERT, M.D., PH.D.

<!-- chunk -->

### Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School,

<!-- chunk -->

### and Director of Transcend Research Program,

<!-- chunk -->

### Massachusetts General Hospital

<!-- chunk -->

### In the twenty-first century the watchword of biology is “systems.” As our

<!-- chunk -->

### technologies race ahead in sophistication, we are being flooded with evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### for the integration of functions in our brains and bodies. Things are very

<!-- chunk -->

### connected, and they are very interdependent. Gone is the single gene acting by

<!-- chunk -->

### itself; it has been replaced by networks. And gone is genetics acting by itself—

<!-- chunk -->

### this has been replaced by integration across levels. Genomics, proteomics,

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolomics, and many more “omics” are all intertwined. This is the new

<!-- chunk -->

### “systems biology.”

<!-- chunk -->

### What does this have to do with our health? In the twentieth century,

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine chopped the body up into specialties—neurology, cardiology,

<!-- chunk -->

### gastroenterology, and endocrinology. Specialists zoomed into their corner of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body; but who was minding the whole picture? Very few doctors have had that

<!-- chunk -->

### skill. Systems biology demands a fresh approach, and that’s where Functional

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicine comes in. Rather than treating the body as a collection of separate

<!-- chunk -->

### organ systems, it looks at how our cells and systems flourish and how they get

<!-- chunk -->

### into trouble. Functional Medicine is the practical interface for systems biology in

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical care. It looks for system problems so it can catch things early and treat

<!-- chunk -->

### root causes rather than symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the twenty-first century it is also becoming clear that the brain is deeply

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to the body, and that the brain and body profoundly shape each other. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain is in the body, and the body systems are in trouble, the brain will be in

<!-- chunk -->

### trouble too. Many of the systems commonly unwell in the body will also be

<!-- chunk -->

### unwell in the brain. Dr. Hyman uses Functional Medicine to show that if you

<!-- chunk -->

### treat these unwell systems, you help your body and that helps your brain too.

<!-- chunk -->

### The chemical imbalances underlying “psychiatric illness” can now be seen

<!-- chunk -->

### as linked to more systemic chemical, metabolic problems, which can be treated

<!-- chunk -->

### at the bodily level. While just treating the brain chemistry can lead to drug

<!-- chunk -->

### dependence, treating systemic chemistry can fix the brain chemistry imbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### and lead to real sustainable healing.

<!-- chunk -->

### With the onslaught of so much stress and so many chemical and other

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental challenges, it’s no wonder that our body systems are challenged,

<!-- chunk -->

### and that our brain function is not what it should be. Dr. Hyman’s seven keys to

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness offer a clear approach to supporting and healing our core

<!-- chunk -->

### functional systems. While more research is important, we know enough to deal

<!-- chunk -->

### intelligently with these challenges right now, and Dr. Hyman shows not only

<!-- chunk -->

### why but how.

# PREFACE

<!-- chunk -->

### For the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie—deliberate, contrived,

<!-- chunk -->

### and dishonest—but the myth—persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often

<!-- chunk -->

### we hold fast to the clichés of our forbears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated

<!-- chunk -->

### set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of

<!-- chunk -->

### thought.

—JOHN F. KENNEDY

<!-- chunk -->

### Be open minded, but not so open minded that your brains fall out.

—GROUCHO MARX

# Why Diseases Don’t Matter

<!-- chunk -->

### In opening this book on the brain and mood, my guess is you are surprised

<!-- chunk -->

### by the absence of any chapters on familiar diseases like depression, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, or Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead you find chapters on nutrition, hormones, inflammation, digestion,

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification, energy, and calming the mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### If diseases as we know them were a useful way to think about what is

<!-- chunk -->

### wrong with our brains, our moods, and our thinking, then I would have written a

<!-- chunk -->

### book about them. But they are not useful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead this book is an exploration of what is really wrong with our brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is about the real causes and solutions for our mental suffering and the

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemics of depression, anxiety, dementia, autism, and attention deficit disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### we see in today’s world. If you have been diagnosed with “mental disorders” or

<!-- chunk -->

### “brain diseases,” I will tell you what you really need to know about the cause

<!-- chunk -->

### and cure for your suffering. Diseases as we currently define them will no longer

<!-- chunk -->

### be relevant, as we understand the basic common molecular mechanisms at the

<!-- chunk -->

### root of your symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### I challenge you to put aside your beliefs about your suffering, and discover

<!-- chunk -->

### how medicine has evolved without anyone noticing. This book is about that

<!-- chunk -->

### change, and the possibility of renewal for you.

# INTRODUCTION

<!-- chunk -->

## How to Use This Book

<!-- chunk -->

### Welcome to your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have just picked up the instruction book for the rest of your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is what you will find in these pages.

# Part I: An Accidental Psychiatrist’s Approach to the

# Epidemic of Broken Brains

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part I you will learn about our epidemic of “broken brains”—both the

<!-- chunk -->

### scope and the cause of the problem facing us in the twenty-first century. And you

<!-- chunk -->

### will learn why the solutions to this problem are available today but nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### ignored.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will also learn why fixing your body is the best way to fix your broken

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and why the foundations of modern psychiatry and neurology are based on

<!-- chunk -->

### myths.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then you will learn why you are suffering from brain damage—all the

<!-- chunk -->

### myriad causes of injury to the soft, custardlike, three-pound wonder that is your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.

# Part II: The Seven Keys to UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part II, you will learn how imbalances in the seven basic core systems of

<!-- chunk -->

### your body—nutrition, hormones, immune function, digestion, detoxification,

<!-- chunk -->

### energy metabolism, and mind-body—explain all the symptoms and diseases we

<!-- chunk -->

### think are “brain” problems. In truth, these are simply imbalances in the body that

<!-- chunk -->

### show up in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will also find specific quizzes for each of the seven key systems to help

<!-- chunk -->

### you identify your unique imbalances.

# Part III: The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Part III is a practical how-to, step-by-step program to fix your broken brain

<!-- chunk -->

### using the UltraMind Solution. You will learn how to:

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat right for your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Tune up your brain chemistry with supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise, sleep, relax, and train your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Live clean and green

# Part IV: Balance the Seven Keys to UltraWellness and

# Optimize the Six-Week Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part IV, you will learn how to customize the UltraMind Solution to help

<!-- chunk -->

### correct the unique imbalances you discover through the quizzes in Part II.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will also learn how to partner with your health-care practitioner when

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to correct the unique imbalances that prevent you from leading a whole,

<!-- chunk -->

### complete, joyful, and fulfilled life.

# The UltraMind Companion Guide

<!-- chunk -->

### Before you get started on the program, I wanted to let you know I have

<!-- chunk -->

### created a companion guide that is designed to make your path to an UltraMind as

<!-- chunk -->

### simple as possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Go to www.ultramind.com/guide and download The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Companion Guide. It is packed with tips and techniques that make what you are

<!-- chunk -->

### about to experience even easier.

# PART I

# The Accidental Psychiatrist’s Approach

# to the Epidemic of Broken Brains


# BROKEN BRAINS

<!-- chunk -->

## A Twenty-first Century Epidemic


<!-- chunk -->

### Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what

<!-- chunk -->

### nobody has thought.

—ALBERT VON SZENT-GYÖRGYI NAGYRAPOLT,

<!-- chunk -->

### Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine,

<!-- chunk -->

### the scientist who isolated vitamin C

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is broken. You know it. You feel it. You hide it. You fear it. You

<!-- chunk -->

### have been touched by an epidemic. It deprives children of their future, the

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly of their past, and adults of their present.

<!-- chunk -->

### No one is talking about this invisible epidemic. Yet it’s the leading cause of

<!-- chunk -->

### disability, affects 1.1 billion people worldwide


<!-- chunk -->

### —one in six children, one in two

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly—and will cripple one in four people during their lifetime.


<!-- chunk -->

### I am talking about the epidemic of broken brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### We refer to our “broken brains” by many names—depression, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss, brain fog, attention deficit disorder or ADD, autism, and dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### to name a few.

<!-- chunk -->

### This epidemic of brain breakdown shows up in radically different ways

<!-- chunk -->

### from person to person so that they all seem like separate problems. But the truth

<!-- chunk -->

### is that they are all manifestations of a few common underlying root causes.

<!-- chunk -->

### These seemingly different disorders are all really the same problem—

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in the seven keys to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Conventional treatments don’t help, make things worse, or provide only

<!-- chunk -->

### slight benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s because conventional treatments use the wrong model to heal these


<!-- chunk -->

### There is another way to fix your broken brain, and it is not what you have

<!-- chunk -->

### heard or might think.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just as brain problems all stem from the same root causes, they all have the

<!-- chunk -->

### same solution—The UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### I know this as both doctor and patient. My own brain broke one beautiful

<!-- chunk -->

### late August day in 1996. I became disoriented and terrified and descended into a

<!-- chunk -->

### spiral of helplessness and hopelessness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me tell you my story.

# My Broken Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning, thinking, and speaking were always easy for me. My brain never

<!-- chunk -->

### failed me. In college, I learned thousands of Chinese characters. In medical

<!-- chunk -->

### school, the intricate patterns and names of our anatomy—the bones, muscles,

<!-- chunk -->

### organs, vessels, and nerves—mapped effortlessly into my mind, and the complex

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways of physiology and biochemistry were clear after one lecture and

<!-- chunk -->

### reading my notes.

<!-- chunk -->

### I ran four miles every day to medical school. I took detailed notes in my

<!-- chunk -->

### classes, able to simultaneously listen to, remember, and write down nearly every

<!-- chunk -->

### word my professors spoke.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the day I ran back again to my apartment, did yoga for an

<!-- chunk -->

### hour, ate a freshly prepared whole-foods meal, and studied without distraction or

<!-- chunk -->

### loss of focus for three hours every night. Then I crawled into bed, fell peacefully

<!-- chunk -->

### asleep within five minutes, and slept deeply for seven hours.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next day I got up and did it all over again.

<!-- chunk -->

### That rhythmic life broke down, as it does for all physicians in training,

<!-- chunk -->

### when I entered the hospital and started pushing my body and mind beyond their

<!-- chunk -->

### limits with regular thirty-six-hour shifts on top of an occasional sixty-hour shift

<!-- chunk -->

### (Friday morning to Monday evening!).

<!-- chunk -->

### When I went to practice as a small-town family doctor in Idaho, I worked a

<!-- chunk -->

### shortened schedule of only eighty hours a week, seeing thirty patients a day,

<!-- chunk -->

### delivering babies, and working in the emergency room.

<!-- chunk -->

### From Idaho, I went to work in China for a year, breathing in the coal-

<!-- chunk -->

### soaked, mercury-laden air, before I landed back in Massachusetts, working a

<!-- chunk -->

### crazy schedule of shifts in an inner-city emergency room.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then suddenly (or so it appeared at the time), my brain broke—along the

<!-- chunk -->

### with rest of my body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sitting with patients, I often couldn’t remember what they had just said, or

<!-- chunk -->

### where I was in eliciting their story. I tried to take careful notes and keep track,

<!-- chunk -->

### but I couldn’t focus on conversations, couldn’t remember anyone’s name. I

<!-- chunk -->

### started taking pictures and writing down personal details about my patients to

<!-- chunk -->

### serve as my peripheral memory so I wouldn’t embarrass myself the next time I

<!-- chunk -->

### spoke to them.

<!-- chunk -->

### During lectures I had to give as part of my job, I would get lost in the

<!-- chunk -->

### middle of a sentence and had to ask the audience what I had just said. When I

<!-- chunk -->

### read a book, I had to go over passages again and again just to glean any

<!-- chunk -->

### meaning. At night, I read my children bedtime stories but had to robotically

<!-- chunk -->

### mouth the words, because I couldn’t simultaneously read aloud and understand

<!-- chunk -->

### what I read.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep eluded me. Exhausted and bone weary, I would lie down in bed at

<!-- chunk -->

### night and remain sleepless for hours. After finally drifting off, I would wake the

<!-- chunk -->

### next morning feeling as if I had never slept.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression and anxiety, which I had never known before, became constant

<!-- chunk -->

### companions.

<!-- chunk -->

### At times I felt I couldn’t go on any longer. My capacity for pleasure and

<!-- chunk -->

### laughter faded into a distant memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The worse my body felt, the worse my brain functioned. If my stomach was

<!-- chunk -->

### bloated and swollen and I had diarrhea, I couldn’t think or sleep. If my tongue

<!-- chunk -->

### was inflamed or my eyes swollen and red, I became depressed. If my muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### ached and twitched, I couldn’t focus. If I felt bone-weary fatigue, I would forget

<!-- chunk -->

### what I was saying or why I had just walked into a room.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some doctors said I was depressed and recommended antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatrists suggested antianxiety drugs. My family doctor prescribed sleeping

<!-- chunk -->

### medication. A neurologist told me I had ADD and I needed stimulants. Others

<!-- chunk -->

### said I had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. All I knew was that my brain was

<!-- chunk -->

### broken, my focus gone, my mood depressed, my memory fleeting, and my body

<!-- chunk -->

### wasn’t working.

<!-- chunk -->

### All at once, I couldn’t pay attention, remember, or experience joy and

<!-- chunk -->

### happiness. It was as if I had suddenly “contracted” three terrible diseases—

<!-- chunk -->

### attention deficit disorder, depression, and dementia. How could my brain have

<!-- chunk -->

### failed me? The part of me that was strongest suddenly became my weakest link.

<!-- chunk -->

### What had happened?

<!-- chunk -->

### What I experienced was extreme and I hid it from the rest of the world,

<!-- chunk -->

### except for a very few close friends. I faked it and pulled myself through each day.

<!-- chunk -->

### But after that summer day in August when my brain broke, weary and

<!-- chunk -->

### fighting brain fog, I began searching for answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Piece by piece, cell by cell, body system by body system, I discovered the

<!-- chunk -->

### source of my broken brain. By combing through the literature, consulting with

<!-- chunk -->

### dozens of scientists and doctors, and experimenting with my body and mind, I

<!-- chunk -->

### slowly put myself back together.

<!-- chunk -->

### It wasn’t one thing that broke my brain. It was everything piled higher and

<!-- chunk -->

### higher until my brain and body couldn’t take anymore. It seemed sudden but was

<!-- chunk -->

### the end of a long series of exposures to toxins, stress, and a strange infection.

<!-- chunk -->

### The trail led back to mercury poisoning from living in Beijing, China,

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing in raw coal used to heat homes for 10 million people, eating endless

<!-- chunk -->

### childhood tunafish sandwiches, and having a mouthful of “silver” or mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### fillings. I was also missing a key gene needed to detoxify all this mercury, which

<!-- chunk -->

### compounded the problem. I found out about this later through careful testing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Years of sleepless nights delivering babies and working in the emergency

<!-- chunk -->

### room destroyed my body’s rhythms, which I tried to bolster with quadruple

<!-- chunk -->

### espressos, giant-size chocolate chip cookies, and mountains of Chunky Monkey

<!-- chunk -->

### ice cream (I reasoned that was healthy because of the bananas and walnuts!).

<!-- chunk -->

### Then one late summer day in 1996 I ate or drank something up in a

<!-- chunk -->

### wilderness camp in Maine that infected my gut. That was the straw that broke

<!-- chunk -->

### the camel’s back.

<!-- chunk -->

### This book is the story of my healing. It is also the story of the discoveries I

<!-- chunk -->

### made that hold the answer to our current epidemic of broken brains. It offers a

<!-- chunk -->

### solution to your suffering just as it did to mine.

<!-- chunk -->

### How many of you feel what I felt, at least to some degree?

<!-- chunk -->

### Maybe you fear losing your job because you’re tired, unfocused,

<!-- chunk -->

### inattentive, and your memory is failing so you can’t properly perform

<!-- chunk -->

### your tasks at work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you feel depressed, hopeless, disconnected, and disengaged from your

<!-- chunk -->

### life?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you see your relationships breaking down because you are mentally

<!-- chunk -->

### and emotionally absent or numb?

<!-- chunk -->

### Perhaps you struggle to focus so you can help your children with their

<!-- chunk -->

### homework and guide them through life, but feel sure you aren’t living up

<!-- chunk -->

### to your duties as a parent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you lie awake at night, tormented by the grief and pain of living half a

<!-- chunk -->

### life, and then worry about how you will find a way to wake up early in

<!-- chunk -->

### the morning just so you can get your kids to school?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you forget to meet friends or go to appointments, and then can’t figure

<!-- chunk -->

### out how in the world you forgot?

<!-- chunk -->

### If so, you aren’t alone. You have been affected by the broken brain

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemic, a terrifying and life-threatening chronic illness that has been largely

<!-- chunk -->

### unaddressed by the medical community, leaving millions of people to suffer

<!-- chunk -->

### alone, trapped in their deteriorating minds.

# Our Looming Silent Epidemic of Broken Brains

<!-- chunk -->

### Obesity is obvious. You can’t hide it. But mental illness and memory loss are

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered silently, hidden from view. Yet they touch nearly everyone either

<!-- chunk -->

### directly or indirectly; personally or through family members and friends.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our broken brains cause many problems—anxiety, depression, bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, personality disorders, eating disorders, addictions, obsessive-compulsive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, attention deficit disorder, autism, Asperger’s, learning difficulties, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dyslexia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Broken brains take many shapes, including psychotic disorders such as

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia and mania, as well as all the neurodegenerative diseases of aging,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially Alzheimer’s, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition, there are brain dysfunctions that fall on the lighter side of the

<!-- chunk -->

### broken brain continuum. While many psychiatrists and neurologists wouldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### qualify these problems as treatable diseases, they still cause unnecessary

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering for many. These include chronic stress, lack of focus, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, brain fog, anger, mood swings, sleep problems, or just feeling a

<!-- chunk -->

### bit anxious or depressed most of the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Broken brains show up in two major ways: psychiatric disorders—problems

<!-- chunk -->

### that most blame on emotional trauma—and neurological disorders— problems

<!-- chunk -->

### most consider to be caused by neurological impairment, not emotional

<!-- chunk -->

### malfunctioning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whether you suffer from a psychiatric disorder like depression or a

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorder like Alzheimer’s, the simple fact is this...

<!-- chunk -->

### Our brains don’t work well.

<!-- chunk -->

### We suffer from bouts of depression that darken our days and make our lives

<!-- chunk -->

### feel empty and meaningless. We have irrational fears that torment us day in and

<!-- chunk -->

### day out. We live under the constant pressure of stress that never seems to cease.

<!-- chunk -->

### We lose our grip on reality. We can’t focus at work. We can’t remember what we

<!-- chunk -->

### are taught in school. And our memories just get worse and worse every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because they are so pervasive, broken brains are one of the primary issues

<!-- chunk -->

### keeping many in today’s society from being optimally healthy and feeling vitally

<!-- chunk -->

### alive—an experience I call UltraWellness, which is something you are going to

<!-- chunk -->

### learn how to achieve in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you think this isn’t a serious problem or it only affects a few people,

<!-- chunk -->

### think again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatric disorders affect 26 percent of our adult population or more

<!-- chunk -->

### than 60 million Americans.

<!-- chunk -->

### More than 20 percent of children have some type of psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

### More than 40 million people have anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### More than 20 million people have depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### One in ten Americans takes an antidepressant.

<!-- chunk -->

### The use of antidepressants has tripled in the last decade.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2006, expenditures on antidepressants soared to over $1.9 billion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are expensive.


<!-- chunk -->

### They are

<!-- chunk -->

### among the top five most costly medical conditions, including heart

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, cancer, trauma, and lung disorders. The cost to our health-care

<!-- chunk -->

### system exceeds $200 billion a year, which is over 12 percent of total

<!-- chunk -->

### health-care spending.


<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease will affect 30 percent (and some experts say

<!-- chunk -->

### percent) of people over eighty-five years old, which is the fastest-

<!-- chunk -->

### growing segment of the population. It will affect 16 million people by

<!-- chunk -->

### 2050.

<!-- chunk -->

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a label we now give 8.7 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of children between the ages of eight and fifteen.


<!-- chunk -->

### More than 8 million, or one in ten, children now take stimulant

<!-- chunk -->

### medications like methylphenidate (Ritalin).


<!-- chunk -->

### Autism rates have increased from 3 in 10,000 children to 1 in

<!-- chunk -->

### children—an elevenfold increase—over the last decade.


<!-- chunk -->

### Learning disabilities affect between 5 and 10 percent of school-age

<!-- chunk -->

### children.


<!-- chunk -->

### The indirect costs of all these broken brains to society are mammoth.

<!-- chunk -->

### They include loss of productivity at school, home, or in the workplace,

<!-- chunk -->

### accounting for a loss of over $80 billion a year.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is something wrong with this picture. Nearly one in three of us

<!-- chunk -->

### suffers from a broken brain. Is this a normal part of the human condition?

<!-- chunk -->

### No. It isn’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is that we’ve been looking for answers to these problems in

<!-- chunk -->

### the wrong places—in the corners of our past, in the chemical “imbalances” in

<!-- chunk -->

### our brains, in the latest drug or therapeutic approach.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is especially true of psychiatry and neurology, the two specialties that

<!-- chunk -->

### typically treat “brain disorders.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurologists and psychiatrists focus on treating your brain using

<!-- chunk -->

### medications or psychotherapy. In fact, most psychiatrists and neurologists focus

<!-- chunk -->

### solely on their favorite organ, the brain, and ignore the rest of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what if the cure for brain disorders is outside the brain? What if mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, attention and behavior problems, and most other “brain diseases” have

<!-- chunk -->

### their root cause in the rest of the body—in treatable imbalances in the body’s key

<!-- chunk -->

### systems? What if they are not localized in the brain? If this is true, it would

<!-- chunk -->

### mean our whole approach to dealing with brain disorders is completely

<!-- chunk -->

### backward.

<!-- chunk -->

### Indeed, it is.

# Why Traditional Neurology and Psychiatry Typically

# Don’t Work

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatry has its roots in the notion that previous life experiences or

<!-- chunk -->

### traumas control mood and behavior. This is the legacy of Sigmund Freud—that

<!-- chunk -->

### all mental illness is the result of childhood experiences.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet only about 10 percent of us are nutritionally, metabolically, and

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemically balanced enough to fully benefit from psychotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s more, years of psychoanalysis or therapy will not reverse the

<!-- chunk -->

### depression that comes from profound omega-3 fatty acid deficiencies,


<!-- chunk -->

### a lack of


<!-- chunk -->

### a low-functioning thyroid,


<!-- chunk -->

### or chronic mercury toxicity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Certainly, if the body is back in balance, working with the emotional and

<!-- chunk -->

### spiritual dimensions of our suffering is critical and necessary. But it is a very

<!-- chunk -->

### hard road to follow without addressing how our genes, diet, and environment

<!-- chunk -->

### interact to change our brain chemistry and detract from the optimal function and

<!-- chunk -->

### balance of our body and mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a significant biological imbalance, psychotherapy is a

<!-- chunk -->

### distraction and a waste of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### And many of us suffer from biological imbalances...

<!-- chunk -->

### Sensing this, modern psychiatry has moved into an elaborate attempt to

<!-- chunk -->

### control brain chemistry with drugs, as if all mental illness were a brain chemistry

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance and all we have to do is match the right drug (or drugs) to the mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Is Depression a Prozac Deficiency?

<!-- chunk -->

### Is this the answer to our epidemic of broken brains—more and better

<!-- chunk -->

### medication? Do we really need more antidepressants, stimulants, antipsychotics,

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory medications?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are we defectively designed so that we cannot be happy, or concentrate or

<!-- chunk -->

### remember things, without pills? Is depression a Prozac deficiency? Is ADHD a

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin deficiency? Is Alzheimer’s an Aricept deficiency?

<!-- chunk -->

### I think not.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet the use of these drugs is skyrocketing. Psychiatric or psychotropic

<!-- chunk -->

### medications are the number-two selling class of prescription drugs,


<!-- chunk -->

### after

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol medication. And the rate of increase in the use of psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### medications in the last decade is meteoric (such as a 1,000 percent increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### the use of stimulant medication in children).

<!-- chunk -->

### If treatments like these were completely effective and free of side effects, I

<!-- chunk -->

### would welcome them to provide relief from suffering for millions. But they do

<!-- chunk -->

### not work well (or at all) for many.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take the example of antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most patients who take antidepressants either don’t respond or have only a

<!-- chunk -->

### partial response. In fact, success is considered a 50 percent improvement in half

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms. And this minimal result is achieved in less than half the patients

<!-- chunk -->

### taking these medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s a pretty dismal record. It’s made worse by the fact that 86 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### those who do find some relief from their symptoms have one or more side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects, including sexual dysfunction, fatigue, insomnia, loss of mental abilities,

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea, and weight gain!

<!-- chunk -->

### No wonder half of the people who try antidepressants quit after four

<!-- chunk -->

### months.


<!-- chunk -->

### A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine discovered that

<!-- chunk -->

### drug companies selectively published studies on antidepressants. They published

<!-- chunk -->

### nearly all the studies that showed benefit and almost none of the studies that

<!-- chunk -->

### showed they don’t work.


<!-- chunk -->

### This kind of underreporting warps our view, leading us to think that

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants (and other psychiatric medications) do work when they don’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### This hiding of the real and complete data on antidepressants has fueled the

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendous growth we have seen in psychiatric medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is actually worse than it sounds because the positive studies

<!-- chunk -->

### hardly show benefit in the first place. In double-blind studies of antidepressants

<!-- chunk -->

### (where people are given either the medication or a sugar pill) 40 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### people taking a sugar pill got better, while only 60 percent taking the actual drug

<!-- chunk -->

### had improvement in their symptoms. Looking at it another way—80 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### people get better with just a sugar pill.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ll admit, the approach is half right. Chemical imbalances lead to problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the real question that manipulating brain chemicals with drugs begs is never

<!-- chunk -->

### asked...

<!-- chunk -->

## Why are those chemicals out of balance in the first place and how do

<!-- chunk -->

## we get them back to their natural state of balance?

<!-- chunk -->

### These drugs don’t cure the problem. They cover over the symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### To cure the epidemic of broken brains we have to ask a new set of

<!-- chunk -->

### questions:

<!-- chunk -->

### How do we find the cause of this epidemic?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are we defectively designed, or is it our toxic environment, our nutrient-

<!-- chunk -->

### depleted diet, and our unremitting stress affecting our sensitive brains? Is

<!-- chunk -->

### it the result of imbalances in our body?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are more drugs really the answer, or is there a way to address the

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying causes of this epidemic so that we can regain our mental (and

<!-- chunk -->

### physical) health and live whole, functional, fulfilling lives?

<!-- chunk -->

### There is an answer to brain problems, but it’s not more drugs or

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapy. Although these tools can be a helpful bridge during your

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery from a broken brain, they won’t provide long-term solutions.

<!-- chunk -->

### The secret that promises to help us fix our broken brains lies in an unlikely

<!-- chunk -->

### place, a place modern medicine has mostly ignored.

<!-- chunk -->

## The answer lies in our body.


# THE ACCIDENTAL PSYCHIATRIST

<!-- chunk -->

## Finding the Body-Mind Connection


<!-- chunk -->

### Do you see what you believe or do you believe what you see?

—SIDNEY BAKER, M.D.

<!-- chunk -->

### I wasn’t sad, hopeless, forgetful, and unable to focus because I had

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, attention deficit disorder, or dementia. It was because I was toxic,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed, nutritionally depleted, my gut was a mess, my hormones were out of

<!-- chunk -->

### balance, my cells were unable to make energy, and I was stressed out from being

<!-- chunk -->

### a single parent.

<!-- chunk -->

### It wasn’t until I learned how to rebuild all these broken systems and heal

<!-- chunk -->

### my body that I got my brain back.

<!-- chunk -->

### The solution I found is the same one I am going to teach you.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### To learn how to fix your brain you are going to have to accept a radically

<!-- chunk -->

### new way of thinking about health—one that most doctors today still struggle to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand. The crux of it is embodied in a simple truth:

<!-- chunk -->

### Everything is connected.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your entire body and all of the core systems in it interact as a single

<!-- chunk -->

### sophisticated symphony. You are one whole person, and all the pieces of your

<!-- chunk -->

### biology and your unique genetic code interact with your environment (including

<!-- chunk -->

### the foods you eat) to determine how sick or well you are in this moment.

<!-- chunk -->

### This means your body-and-mind are connected as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The body-and-mind are a single, dynamic bidirectional system. What you

<!-- chunk -->

### do to one has enormous impact on the other. What you do to your body you do to

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain. Heal your body and you heal your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Change your body and you will fix your broken brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes, traumas, and life experiences directly

<!-- chunk -->

### influence your biology. We know that stress and other psychological factors can

<!-- chunk -->

### have a major impact on your health. Now we understand that 95 percent of all

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses are either caused by or worsened by stress. What you think can

<!-- chunk -->

### influence how sick or well you are. The mind influences the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is known as Mind-Body Medicine. It is an important contribution to

<!-- chunk -->

### the field of science and is researched by major institutions such as Harvard and

<!-- chunk -->

### Stanford.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sadly, most physicians do not apply this knowledge in their practices. They

<!-- chunk -->

### accept it. But rather than using the power of the mind to heal, they disdainfully

<!-- chunk -->

### say that people with psychological influences on their health have

<!-- chunk -->

### “psychosomatic illness,” or “somatize,” meaning that their “physical” symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### are all in their head.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even worse, somato-psychic medicine (or how the body affects the mind) is

<!-- chunk -->

### hardly on the radar.

<!-- chunk -->

### The body directly and powerfully influences the brain. Nutritional status,

<!-- chunk -->

### hormonal imbalances, food allergies, toxins, and digestive, immune, and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic imbalances, primarily influence mood, behavior, attention, and

<!-- chunk -->

### attitude.

<!-- chunk -->

### You already know about this body-mind connection, even if you have never

<!-- chunk -->

### consciously considered it. Just take a moment to think about how your own body

<!-- chunk -->

### has affected your mind over your lifetime, and then extrapolate that to more

<!-- chunk -->

### serious conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Have you ever felt anxious, irritable, jittery, fearful, or even had a panic

<!-- chunk -->

### attack only to have a can of cola or muffin and feel better right away?

<!-- chunk -->

### Why were you anxious? Because your blood sugar was plummeting, and

<!-- chunk -->

### when that happens your body is programmed to respond as though it is a

<!-- chunk -->

### life-threatening emergency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you feel foggy and mentally sluggish after eating a large meal?

<!-- chunk -->

### Have you ever felt stressed and anxious and then taken a long walk or

<!-- chunk -->

### ridden your bike a few miles only to feel calm and relaxed afterward?

<!-- chunk -->

### Why did this happen? Because you burned off the stress chemicals,

<!-- chunk -->

### adrenaline and cortisol, which made you feel anxious.

<!-- chunk -->

### Have you ever felt angry and irritable because you have been deprived of

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep? Have you felt happier and that you had fewer problems after a

<!-- chunk -->

### great night’s sleep?

<!-- chunk -->

### Have you ever had the flu and tried to focus and read a book or

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrate on anything only to find it difficult, perhaps even

<!-- chunk -->

### impossible?

<!-- chunk -->

### Have you ever hallucinated or been delirious with a high fever?

<!-- chunk -->

### These are basic examples of the body-mind connection that many of us have

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced. But there are so many other things that occur inside of you that

<!-- chunk -->

### affect your brain and mind of which you have no awareness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Did you know that premenstrual mood swings are the result of fluctuating

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone levels, or that your winter blues are the result of vitamin D deficiency,

<!-- chunk -->

### or that your lifelong melancholy may be the result of mercury poisoning from

<!-- chunk -->

### hundreds of tuna fish sandwiches you’ve eaten over your lifetime, or that your

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive-compulsive disorder could be the result of a bacterial infection?

<!-- chunk -->

### These obvious and not so obvious interactions between your body and your

<!-- chunk -->

### mind are only the tip of the iceberg.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consider for a moment that depression, anxiety, insomnia, attention deficit

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder—not to mention the hundreds of

<!-- chunk -->

### other mental disorders described by psychiatrists in the Diagnostic and

<!-- chunk -->

### Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)—may be primarily caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in the body and have very little to do with the meaning, metaphors,

<!-- chunk -->

### and myths we associated with them. It is a perfect system for describing your

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, but useless for helping you find the cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, there are a few conditions recognized and treated by

<!-- chunk -->

### conventional medicine that clearly show how problems in your body cause

<!-- chunk -->

### “diseases” in your brain, but the implications are ignored.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, when someone with late-stage liver disease develops

<!-- chunk -->

### something called “hepatic encephalopathy” or temporary insanity from liver

<!-- chunk -->

### failure, the treatment is not antipsychotics, but antibiotics to clear out the

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria in the intestine, which produce brain-destroying toxins that can no

<!-- chunk -->

### longer be detoxified by the liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imagine, treating insanity with antibiotics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Similarly, we know that alcoholics become “crazy” with a condition known

<!-- chunk -->

### as Wernicke’s encephalopathy from vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### (or thiamine) deficiency, which

<!-- chunk -->

### can be cured by giving them a vitamin.

<!-- chunk -->

### And we know that an antibiotic for a streptococcal infection can cure some

<!-- chunk -->

### children who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder. The condition is called

<!-- chunk -->

### PANDAS or Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### Streptococcal Infections.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet physicians typically don’t stop to consider whether or not other mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders may be related to imbalances in gut function, the immune system,

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with detoxification, or an imbalance in any of the body’s other key

<!-- chunk -->

### systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### I think this is because doctors tend to see what they believe and often don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### believe what they see, even when it is right in front of them.

<!-- chunk -->

### What happens in the body influences the brain, as we never imagined it

<!-- chunk -->

### could. The implications for treatment of mental and brain disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### staggering. A whole new array of possible causes and treatments are open to us.

<!-- chunk -->

### Changing your diet, nutrient levels, circadian rhythms or sleep patterns, the

<!-- chunk -->

### substances you use, the amount of exercise or playtime you have, getting rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins in your system, balancing your hormones, correcting imbalances in your

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive tract, boosting your cells’ ability to produce energy, and fixing food

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivities or allergies can all radically transform your mood and brain


<!-- chunk -->

### With that in mind, consider the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### Can lifelong depression be cured?

<!-- chunk -->

### Can children completely recover from autism?

<!-- chunk -->

### Can dementia be reversed?

<!-- chunk -->

### Conventional medical wisdom says no. We don’t see many cases in the

<!-- chunk -->

### medical literature where people recover from autism, reverse dementia, or are

<!-- chunk -->

### cured from lifelong depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### But just because psychiatrists and neurologists aren’t reporting dramatic

<!-- chunk -->

### recoveries like these employing the “normal” methods used to treat such

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders doesn’t mean the disorders aren’t treatable. In conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### approaches, partial relief of symptoms is sometimes possible. But cures or

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatic recoveries? You may hear doctors say, Where is the evidence?

<!-- chunk -->

### The idea that psychiatric or neurological “diseases” like depression, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia can be effectively treated, not by

<!-- chunk -->

### administering psychoactive medication, but by altering dietary and lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### influences and repairing the body’s systems, which affect the entire Body-Mind

<!-- chunk -->

### System in which the brain functions, is resisted by conventional psychiatry and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurology.

<!-- chunk -->

### The forces that distort our view, and keep conventional doctors locked in

<!-- chunk -->

### their way of seeing and thinking, are complex. One factor is the enormous

<!-- chunk -->

### influence drug companies have by way of funding and setting the research

<!-- chunk -->

### agenda, developing treatments, withholding important data that contradicts their

<!-- chunk -->

### worldview, controlling medical education, “educating” doctors, and marketing to

<!-- chunk -->

### consumers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other factors are our medical institutions and our financial reimbursement

<!-- chunk -->

### systems, which are founded on outdated ideas of separate diseases and medical

<!-- chunk -->

### specialties. Abandoning those ideas would threaten their economic viability and

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps even their existence.

<!-- chunk -->

### And our medical training reinforces the illusion of separate body systems

<!-- chunk -->

### by training doctors in specialties and subspecialties—there are doctors for every

<!-- chunk -->

### inch of your body. But there are very few who understand how the whole body

<!-- chunk -->

### works as one complete ecosystem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even when we see research or miracles in practice (dismissed as

<!-- chunk -->

### spontaneous remissions) that contradict our worldview, it is very difficult to

<!-- chunk -->

### integrate. It is ignored or brushed aside in favor of our current paradigm. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fourteenth-century Europe it would have been very hard to convince anyone that

<!-- chunk -->

### the world is round. It looks flat so it must be flat. Similarly, doctors today can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### see what is quickly becoming obvious.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recently presented a lecture at Harvard outlining the case of a boy who

<!-- chunk -->

### recovered from autism using the approach in The UltraMind Solution. I

<!-- chunk -->

### documented in great detail his story, and showed how when his abnormal tests

<!-- chunk -->

### and biology returned to normal, his brain and behavior stabilized, and he lost his

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis of autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### The pediatrician present explained away his recovery as an example of

<!-- chunk -->

### spontaneous remission. One of the other physicians at the lecture, who knew my

<!-- chunk -->

### work, said facetiously, “The only problem is that Dr. Hyman has twelve cases

<!-- chunk -->

### like this of ‘spontaneous remission’ in his practice.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, too many doctors have the same mind-set as that

<!-- chunk -->

### pediatrician: don’t confuse me with the facts. My mind is made up.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nevertheless, the recent discoveries about how behavior, mood, and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning are linked to our biology are one of the greatest advances in twenty-

<!-- chunk -->

### first-century medicine. These discoveries are growing to meet other advances,

<!-- chunk -->

### which show how our thoughts, feelings, and life experiences literally shape our

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and influence our biology.

<!-- chunk -->

### Such research holds the answer to the epidemic of mood, behavior,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, and memory problems that are rampant in today’s society.

<!-- chunk -->

### What I am suggesting in this book is a revolutionary new method for

<!-- chunk -->

### treating broken brains—“mental disorders” and “brain diseases”—that is based

<!-- chunk -->

### on cutting-edge science and medicine; one that marks a radical departure from

<!-- chunk -->

### classical psychiatry and neurology and the methods these fields typically use to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat their patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain is not disconnected from the rest of the body as many

<!-- chunk -->

### practitioners of conventional medicine would have you believe, and the solution

<!-- chunk -->

### to the epidemic of broken brains is not found in more psychoactive medications

<!-- chunk -->

### or better therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain is mostly downstream from the real causes, which are found in

<!-- chunk -->

### the biology of your whole body. Brain problems or “disorders” are almost

<!-- chunk -->

### always systemic disorders, and the cure will be found outside the brain—in your


<!-- chunk -->

### My goal in writing The UltraMind Solution is to show you the new

<!-- chunk -->

### landscape of how brain function, mind, mood, and behavior are created by

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in your body and your biology. I want to show you how to use that

<!-- chunk -->

### information to cure or dramatically improve the rising tide of “broken brains,”

<!-- chunk -->

### including conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disease, psychosis,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention deficit disorder, autism, dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if you don’t have one of these “diseases” and feel “fine,” feeling fine

<!-- chunk -->

### is less than what you could feel. You should and can feel alert, focused, happy,

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic, unstressed, and mentally sharp. That is, if you know how to care for

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is what I will teach you in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### My goal for all of you is to live your life as you were meant to live it—a

<!-- chunk -->

### life full of energy, vitality, pleasure, and happiness. This is the state of

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness, and it is available to everyone if you know how to take advantage

<!-- chunk -->

### of it. The key to this is a balanced mind and body, which will allow you to

<!-- chunk -->

### experience the joys and the sorrows of life as you meet them, directly and fully.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consider the experiences of just a few of my patients:

<!-- chunk -->

### A fifty-three-year-old man with lifelong bipolar disease and crippling

<!-- chunk -->

### depression on a multidrug cocktail who had relief from depression for the

<!-- chunk -->

### first time in thirty years after tuning up his brain function with folate and

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### and B


<!-- chunk -->

### A three-year-old boy with violent behavior who calmed down after

<!-- chunk -->

### balancing his blood sugar and clearing out toxic bacteria from his

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### A twenty-three-year-old woman with lifelong anxiety and depression that

<!-- chunk -->

### lifted after she quit eating foods that she was allergic to.

<!-- chunk -->

### A seventy-year-old man who was losing a grip on his memory and had

<!-- chunk -->

### been diagnosed with early dementia, who after getting all the mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### out of his body, came back to life and was able to work and function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or the little boy with autism, who began to talk and connect socially, after

<!-- chunk -->

### getting rid of gluten and casein (wheat and dairy) from his diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### treating yeast in his gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### How can you explain these “miraculous” cures? It’s simple. Brain function

<!-- chunk -->

### is directly influenced by what you eat, and by nutritional deficiencies, allergens,

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, toxins, and stress. These problems are taken care of by rebalancing

<!-- chunk -->

### the seven keys to UltraWellness. This, in turn, leads to an UltraMind.

<!-- chunk -->

### The solution to this epidemic is getting to the root of the problems by

<!-- chunk -->

### examining how our ancient genes interact with our environment to create

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic imbalances that affect our most prized and sensitive organ—the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution will show you how to correct the causes of the

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in your brain. Those causes often result from imbalances in other

<!-- chunk -->

### systems in your body. This book will teach you how to achieve optimum mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health and brain health without drugs or psychotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This approach is the future medicine, and will soon become the foundation

<!-- chunk -->

### for diagnosing and treating mental illness and brain diseases. It will be the

<!-- chunk -->

### standard way we achieve optimal mental health and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### The last twenty years of research in the field of the brain have concentrated

<!-- chunk -->

### on what makes it able to remember or forget, be happy or sad, feel anxious or

<!-- chunk -->

### calm, and stay focused or be inattentive. Studies have uncovered a few simple

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying factors that explain why things go wrong and how to fix them.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it can take more than twenty years for scientific findings like these to

<!-- chunk -->

### be incorporated into most physicians’ practices, and it may take even longer

<!-- chunk -->

### since they threaten the very foundation of our scientific paradigm.

<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t have to wait another twenty years to take advantage of what we

<!-- chunk -->

### know now.

<!-- chunk -->

### What the years of investigation have revealed is that our troubles with

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, behavior, attention, and memory don’t come from bad parenting or bad

<!-- chunk -->

### genes, but from imbalances in seven key underlying systems in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### And here’s the really big news:

<!-- chunk -->

## These “diseases” really do not exist.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Mental disorders” and “brain disorders” are simply the names of common

<!-- chunk -->

### responses our bodies have to a variety of insults and deficiencies. Fixing those

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying problems by rebalancing the seven keys may allow the brain to heal,

<!-- chunk -->

### the body-mind and mind-body to come back into balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### When even one of these seven core systems is out of balance, illness of all

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds can result, ranging from heart disease to diabetes to weight gain to the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain disorders you have come to this book looking to heal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Helping people balance these seven key systems is the foundation of my

<!-- chunk -->

### medical practice. It is what I did to fix my broken brain and it is how I have

<!-- chunk -->

### helped thousands of patients from all walks of life achieve a state of health they

<!-- chunk -->

### never dreamed possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every day I witness miracles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Giving you a practical way to understand, identify, and fix imbalances in

<!-- chunk -->

### each of the seven key systems of your body (just as I do in my practice) so you

<!-- chunk -->

### can make a miraculous recovery of your own is the purpose of The UltraMind


<!-- chunk -->

### This book makes available for the first time the results of new research and

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge of the brain, mood, and body in a practical guide for everyone young

<!-- chunk -->

### and old, hyper or calm, forgetful or not. It is designed to give you the

<!-- chunk -->

### information and tools you need to treat the roots of your broken brains, and by

<!-- chunk -->

### doing so overcome their devastating effects and take a big step closer to

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### How did I learn about this?

# How I Became an Accidental Psychiatrist

<!-- chunk -->

### I call myself the “accidental psychiatrist.” I never set out to be a brain or

<!-- chunk -->

### mood expert. In fact, my focus was more on how the body works as a whole

<!-- chunk -->

### system. And people saw me not to treat depression or autism or Alzheimer’s, but

<!-- chunk -->

### to deal with chronic complaints and illnesses of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### People make appointments to see me from far away, often after seeing

<!-- chunk -->

### many physicians, dissatisfied with more medications and more diagnoses. They

<!-- chunk -->

### come with a deep inner knowledge that something is out of balance—they just

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t know how to find it by themselves. So many of my patients are willing to

<!-- chunk -->

### begin exploring the landscape of their bodies and minds in a new and deeper

<!-- chunk -->

### way.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because of this I have had the unique opportunity to be a medical detective,

<!-- chunk -->

### hunting down clues and exploring the entire landscape of human biology and

<!-- chunk -->

### systems. I worked for almost ten years as the co-medical director of Canyon

<!-- chunk -->

### Ranch, and now for many years as the founder and medical director of the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness Center (www.ultrawellnesscenter.com).

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the years as I worked to correct the fundamental imbalances that are

<!-- chunk -->

### the cause of all disease (the seven keys to UltraWellness, which you will learn

<!-- chunk -->

### about in a moment), I discovered that mood and brain disorders would often

<!-- chunk -->

### magically disappear as I treated a patient’s physical problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rather than dismiss this finding, I found it curious and began to investigate

<!-- chunk -->

### how treating digestive problems could cure depression, or how detoxifying a

<!-- chunk -->

### patient from mercury could bring back their memory. I investigated each of my

<!-- chunk -->

### patients carefully by listening to their stories of transformation and by examining

<!-- chunk -->

### the existing rich medical literature on this subject, which is mostly ignored.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many years ago I treated a woman with a bacterial infection in her gut from

<!-- chunk -->

### a bug called Clostridia (which produces a molecule called DHPPA, which has

<!-- chunk -->

### neurochemical effects) with an antibiotic. Not only did her digestive symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### clear up, but also her lifelong depression, which was resistant to treatment with

<!-- chunk -->

### medications like Prozac, lifted almost overnight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experiences like these as well as my own struggle with a chronic illness

<!-- chunk -->

### allowed the mysterious world of how the body influences the brain to open up to

<!-- chunk -->

### me.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hence I became an “accidental psychiatrist.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Since then I have found remarkable patterns and connections that link the

<!-- chunk -->

### body to the mind. The wonder of the body continues to delight and amaze me, as

<!-- chunk -->

### I understand more clearly how the entire body and the mind is one interacting,

<!-- chunk -->

### interlocking, networked system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nowhere is this truer than in how the brain is connected to the rest of the


<!-- chunk -->

### Through the prism of one boy’s story told below, you will learn how

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful this approach can be for fixing your broken brain. This one story, and

<!-- chunk -->

### this boy’s two homework assignments done two months apart, will clarify the

<!-- chunk -->

### bidirectional communication between the brain and the body more than any

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated explanation of biochemical pathways.

<!-- chunk -->

### While this is a story about one boy, the story of his imbalanced system and

<!-- chunk -->

### how it affected his brain is repeated millions of times over in America. Each

<!-- chunk -->

### story has its personal flavor, and each person may have different imbalances in

<!-- chunk -->

### physiology. But the overarching principle that ties together all brain disorders is

<!-- chunk -->

### simple.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain disorders resulting in altered mood, memory, behavior, and attention

<!-- chunk -->

### are a result of imbalances in the seven key systems of your body that determine

<!-- chunk -->

### whether you are well or ill, whether you are living a life of UltraWellness or a

<!-- chunk -->

### diminished life of poor mental and physical health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is Clayton’s story...

<!-- chunk -->

## Clayton: A Case Study in the Body-Mind Effect

<!-- chunk -->

### An exasperated professional woman finally found her way to my office with

<!-- chunk -->

### her twelve-year-old son, Clayton. Clayton, labeled with a multitude of both

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological and physical diagnoses by a number of highly specialized

<!-- chunk -->

### physicians, seemed to be a walking embodiment of “bad luck—poor kid.”

<!-- chunk -->

### In the realm of psychiatry Clayton was “diagnosed” with attention deficit

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a behavioral disorder. He could not focus in

<!-- chunk -->

### school, “zoned out,” and was disruptive. Like many other children labeled with

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD or on the autism spectrum, Clayton’s writing was nearly illegible.


<!-- chunk -->

### On the

<!-- chunk -->

### other hand he excelled in math.

<!-- chunk -->

### Physically, Clayton was diagnosed with asthma, suffered from

<!-- chunk -->

### “environmental” allergies, sinus congestion, postnasal drip, sore throats,

<!-- chunk -->

### eczema, nausea, stomach pains, diarrhea, headaches, anal itching, canker sores,

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle aches, muscle cramps, hypersensitivity to noises and smells, sneezing,

<!-- chunk -->

### hives, itchy skin with bumps, and frequent infections. He slept poorly and had

<!-- chunk -->

### trouble breathing when he did sleep. He also suffered from anxiety, fearfulness,

<!-- chunk -->

### and carbohydrate cravings.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of his symptoms were being treated with seven different medications

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribed by five different doctors. These included Ritalin for ADHD, allergy

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, and inhalers for his asthma and hives, acid-blocking medication for

<!-- chunk -->

### his stomach problems, and painkillers for his headaches.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is quite a drug cocktail for a twelve-year-old. Yet he still didn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### experience much relief from his physical, mental, or behavioral symptoms. But

<!-- chunk -->

### this is how we approach things in medicine—divide it all up into parts, farm

<!-- chunk -->

### them out, and pile on the pills. What a life for both Clayton and his family!

<!-- chunk -->

### Most psychiatrists not only lack the training to address any physical issues

<!-- chunk -->

### but also feel these are irrelevant to the mental “diagnosis” at hand. I, however,

<!-- chunk -->

### believe these physical ailments are the most important findings and these clues

<!-- chunk -->

### will provide the causes and appropriate treatment to repair disordered brain


<!-- chunk -->

### Today the list of medications and the untested cocktails and combinations

<!-- chunk -->

### have grown to frightening proportions. Children who present with mental,

<!-- chunk -->

### behavioral, or emotional problems like the ones Clayton had now get

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotic medications, like Risperdal; antiseizure medications, like Trileptal;

<!-- chunk -->

### and antidepressants, like Prozac—all on top of stimulant medications, like

<!-- chunk -->

### Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recently visited a local school nurse. After seeing a large box on the floor

<!-- chunk -->

### filled with empty pill bottles, the nurse told me that 63 percent of the children

<!-- chunk -->

### were on some type of medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### My challenge is to organize symptoms according to how they are

<!-- chunk -->

### influenced by the seven keys of UltraWellness, not by chopping them up into

<!-- chunk -->

### separate diagnoses. That is how I lead my patients to an UltraMind.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clayton’s UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### As we dug below the surface we found and treated the causes of Clayton’s

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms—imbalances in the seven keys to UltraWellness that form the basis of

<!-- chunk -->

### the UltraMind Solution. Here is what we found and what we did. Clayton’s story

<!-- chunk -->

### represents, to one degree or another, all of our stories. It illustrates both the

<!-- chunk -->

### despair and the delivery from our epidemic of broken brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at some of the essential keys affected in Clayton’s case.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutritional Deficiencies

<!-- chunk -->

### Like most kids, and especially those on the spectrum of ADHD and autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton lived on and craved junk food. His typical diet included trans fat, food

<!-- chunk -->

### additives,


<!-- chunk -->

### and an overload of carbohydrates and refined sugar. This has been

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with ADHD.


<!-- chunk -->

### Blood tests confirmed significant deficiencies in many

<!-- chunk -->

### important fats, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. Clayton had no omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### fats and very low levels of tryptophan, vitamins B


<!-- chunk -->

### , A, and D, antioxidants

<!-- chunk -->

### (vitamin E and beta carotene), zinc, and magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

## Omega-3 fats, eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanenoic acid

<!-- chunk -->

### (DHA), are essential for brain function. In fact, 60 percent of the brain consists

<!-- chunk -->

### of DHA. A lack of these fats is strongly associated with ADHD,


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### eczema and immune deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tryptophan is an amino acid (building block of protein) needed to make

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin, the chemical in the brain for a relaxed and happy mood, and

<!-- chunk -->

## melatonin, the chemical for sleep. Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 6

<!-- chunk -->

### is crucial to converting

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan into serotonin. Clayton’s unstable mood, sleep disturbance, and

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD were clues to a B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. Some of his prescription medications were

<!-- chunk -->

### actually further depleting his B


<!-- chunk -->

### supply.


<!-- chunk -->

## A clear indication of low vitamin A and omega-3 fat deficiency were

<!-- chunk -->

### “bumps” on the back of his arms called hyperkeratosis pilaris.


<!-- chunk -->

### His low level of

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamin D led to lowered immunity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Deficiencies of other vitamins such as

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamin E and beta carotene indicated he ate a diet high in junk food and low in

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables and whole grains.

<!-- chunk -->

## Low levels of zinc are associated with lowered immunity, poor heavy metal

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification, and ADHD. This was consistent with Clayton’s frequent

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, eczema, and allergies


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as the hyperactivity symptoms. Low-

<!-- chunk -->

## magnesium levels lead to headaches; anxiety; insomnia, muscle spasms, cramps,

<!-- chunk -->

### and aches; and hypersensitivity to noises.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrients have a multifactorial effect and work in synergy. It is important to

<!-- chunk -->

### attempt to correct all the deficiencies; as you can see, they all interact and

<!-- chunk -->

### overlap.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune and Inflammatory Imbalances

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton had asthma, allergies, hives, sinusitis, itchy skin, canker sores, a

<!-- chunk -->

### history of intolerance to baby formula, diaper rash, and frequent ear infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## These are all clear evidence of immune and inflammatory imbalances.

<!-- chunk -->

### These should not be thought of as separate conditions but rather one

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system highly annoyed by one or more triggers such as food or

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental allergens, molds, toxins, chronic low-grade infections, or perhaps

<!-- chunk -->

### a combination of these factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Special testing for delayed, low-grade food allergies (IgG food sensitivity)

<!-- chunk -->

### showed Clayton’s immune system (and likely his brain

10;11

<!-- chunk -->

### ) was reacting to

<!-- chunk -->

### eighteen foods, including dairy, peanuts, yeast, citrus, and especially gluten, all

<!-- chunk -->

### of which created more inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

## Gluten can trigger a low-grade, chronic immune response that inflames the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and many other systems. Canker sores were just another clue pointing to

<!-- chunk -->

### celiac disease or gluten intolerance.


<!-- chunk -->

### Indeed, his IgG antigliadin antibodies

<!-- chunk -->

### were elevated (indicating an autoimmune reaction to gluten found in wheat, rye,

<!-- chunk -->

### barley, spelt, oats, and tritacle). In a later chapter, you will learn more about why

<!-- chunk -->

### gluten was a major clue in Clayton’s healing process.

<!-- chunk -->

## Digestive Imbalances

<!-- chunk -->

### Nausea, diarrhea, stomachaches, anal itching, and sensitive stomach were

<!-- chunk -->

### clear symptoms of Clayton’s digestive imbalances. The use of frequent

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics for the many infections led to a yeast overgrowth and abnormal gut

<!-- chunk -->

## flora. This resulted in a leaky gut (also called intestinal permeability). This

<!-- chunk -->

### condition gives way to the above-mentioned food allergies, systemic allergies,

<!-- chunk -->

### and inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

### So we can see why his immune system was so angry.

<!-- chunk -->

## Detoxification Imbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### Metal toxicity indicates poor detoxification. Tests showed that Clayton had

<!-- chunk -->

## high levels of mercury and lead. His exposure was probably similar to other

<!-- chunk -->

### children of his age; however, he nutritionally and/or genetically could not

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate the metals from his body and stored them in his tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury has been associated with myriad gastrointestinal as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### autoimmune and cognitive problems.


<!-- chunk -->

### Children born between 1989 and

<!-- chunk -->

### were all exposed to mercury in the form of thimerosal in the multitude of

<!-- chunk -->

### vaccines they were given at a very early age (this mercury preservative was

<!-- chunk -->

### removed from the vaccines in 2001). As you will learn, other sources of mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### include coal-burning industrial plants, many large predatory ocean fish, river

<!-- chunk -->

### fish, and even “silver” dental fillings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lead toxicity has been associated with cognitive and behavioral problems

<!-- chunk -->

### in children.


<!-- chunk -->

### In a recent groundbreaking study, lead toxicity and environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins were clearly linked to ADHD.


<!-- chunk -->

### By living in a polluted world, playing

<!-- chunk -->

### with toys made in China and coated with lead paint, and crawling around on the

<!-- chunk -->

### floor where shoes drag in the lead pollution from the outside, Clayton was

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed to the dangers of the industrial revolution.

<!-- chunk -->

### He may also have suffered from other environmental toxins like mold

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins from the black mold in his house and food additives we could not

<!-- chunk -->

### measure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly, Clayton’s problem was not a Ritalin deficiency or bad parenting!

<!-- chunk -->

### The cause of all these problems lay in the dietary and environmental pollutants

<!-- chunk -->

### that throw the seven underlying systems in our body out of balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Simplicity of Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### It is not any one thing that caused Clayton’s ADHD, abnormal handwriting,

<!-- chunk -->

### hives, asthma, or stomachaches. It was the total load of all the stresses on his

<!-- chunk -->

### system interacting with his unique genetic susceptibilities, which thus led to his

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormal brain function and health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton’s treatment was disarmingly simple.

<!-- chunk -->

### By deliberately and carefully working to find the cause or source of the

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation to his system (nutritional deficiencies, toxic foods, food allergies,

<!-- chunk -->

### gluten, environmental toxins, food additives, yeast overgrowth) and identifying

<!-- chunk -->

### the missing ingredients needed to restore normal physiological function (a

<!-- chunk -->

### multivitamin, omega-3 fats, vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, healthy gut

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria, and 5-hydroxytryptophan for sleep and anxiety), Clayton’s health and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain function could finally start to normalize.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommended a whole-foods diet free of additives, sugar, trans fats,

<!-- chunk -->

### processed foods, and his particular allergic foods—gluten, dairy, citrus, peanuts,

<!-- chunk -->

### and yeast. This is the diet on which the UltraMind Solution is founded.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then we got rid of the low-grade yeast problem he developed after years of

<!-- chunk -->

### taking antibiotics (it showed up as anal itching) with an antifungal medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lead and mercury toxicity was addressed using DMSA, dimercaptosuccinic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid, an FDA-approved medication to remove lead from children. This part of

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatment was postponed until his gastrointestinal health was restored. This

<!-- chunk -->

### was important so Clayton could properly eliminate the metals as they were

<!-- chunk -->

### chelated (pulled out) of his tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### My approach is simple: the first step is to take out the bad stuff; remove

<!-- chunk -->

### what’s irritating you. You need to find all the tacks under your feet to be pain

<!-- chunk -->

### free; removing only one tack will not make you 50 percent better. The second

<!-- chunk -->

### step is to add the good stuff; add the specific vitamins, nutrients, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### “ingredients” you need to thrive. These differ from person to person.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Result of Clayton’s Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton and his mother were diligent and determined to make changes. At

<!-- chunk -->

### his two-month follow-up visit, Clayton had discontinued all medications,

<!-- chunk -->

### including Ritalin, antihistamines (Zyrtec and Tagamet), bronchodilators, steroid

<!-- chunk -->

### inhaler, Tylenol (acetaminophen), and Advil (ibuprofen).

<!-- chunk -->

### His mood and behavior returned to that of a typical twelve-year-old. His

<!-- chunk -->

### attention improved, his disruptiveness at home and in school disappeared, and

<!-- chunk -->

### his irritability and anxiety vanished completely.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton found himself free from all his chronic symptoms for the first time

<!-- chunk -->

### in his life. His hives, asthma, chronic runny nose, anal itching, stomachaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea, diarrhea, headaches, muscle cramps, and sensitivity to loud noises all

<!-- chunk -->

### completely resolved. He was also able to finally fall asleep and stay asleep

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the night. Clayton also began to succeed in school both socially and

<!-- chunk -->

### academically as he never had before.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton did not have a neurological or psychiatric “disease.” He had a

<!-- chunk -->

### “broken brain” caused by nutritional imbalances; toxicity; and altered immune,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter, and digestive function. Treating those root causes and

<!-- chunk -->

### correcting the imbalances led to the resolution of all his symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of these findings and resolutions are subjective; therefore, for those

<!-- chunk -->

### skeptics, one irrefutable objective finding underscores the effectiveness of this

<!-- chunk -->

### approach and “proves” the powerful effect the body has on the mind and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton’s dysgraphia, or abnormal handwriting, completely resolved within

<!-- chunk -->

### two months of treatment (see Figures 1 and 2 below and on page 31). Here is his

<!-- chunk -->

### homework before the UltraMind Solution and two months later.

<!-- chunk -->

## Before Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 1: Clayton’s handwriting before treatment

<!-- chunk -->

## After Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 2: Clayton’s handwriting after treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton’s mother also sent me an e-mail reporting on her meeting with his

<!-- chunk -->

### school. The change was remarkable.

<!-- chunk -->

### We had a 504 meeting at Clayton’s school this morning (where the

<!-- chunk -->

### teachers, school counselor, parents, and principal all get together to review

<!-- chunk -->

### “the plan” for kids with special educational needs—in Clayton’s case

<!-- chunk -->

### prompted by the ADHD diagnosis). This was the first time in his entire

<!-- chunk -->

### schooling history that everything seems to be going well. The input from his

<!-- chunk -->

### teachers was that he is “a different kid” than they saw in the first half of the

<!-- chunk -->

### year and that they’re amazed by the difference. The school nurse hasn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### seen him since March (and he used to be in her office several times a week).

<!-- chunk -->

### The school psychologist said his social skills are very good, age

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate, and that she sees no problems at all. She also noted that

<!-- chunk -->

### Clayton seems very proud of himself and his new health and that he’s taking

<!-- chunk -->

### good ownership of all the changes in his diet. He even seems to be

<!-- chunk -->

### shrugging it off when the other kids at school tell him he’s an “alien”

<!-- chunk -->

### because he doesn’t drink soda.

<!-- chunk -->

### This was just such a fantastic meeting and I wanted to pass along the

<!-- chunk -->

### good news and say thank you!

# HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT WORKED?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of my colleagues argue that it is impossible to know what the

<!-- chunk -->

### most important factors were in Clayton’s treatment or in similar treatments

<!-- chunk -->

### I offer to other patients. These people are stuck in the one-disease, one-

<!-- chunk -->

### drug model of thinking. It is an example of reductionistic thinking that

<!-- chunk -->

### misses the whole point of how systems work—of how the body works.

<!-- chunk -->

### As evident in Clayton’s case, many symptoms are caused by a multitude

<!-- chunk -->

### of irritants and a variety of irritants cause a multitude of symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Success is not possible unless all the factors are addressed. If we just

<!-- chunk -->

### stopped food allergens, or just gave zinc, or just treated yeast, or just

<!-- chunk -->

### stopped food additives, or just stopped trans fats, Clayton would not have

<!-- chunk -->

### gotten better.

<!-- chunk -->

### This story is not an isolated anecdote, but a story repeated over and over in

<!-- chunk -->

### medical practices based on Functional Medicine, which is where the principles

<!-- chunk -->

### of UltraWellness and UltraMind originate.

<!-- chunk -->

### This case (and so many others like it) suggests that priority be given to

<!-- chunk -->

### research that teases out the subtleties of how to apply this approach to our

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemic of brain and psychiatric disorders. Instead we continue to research

<!-- chunk -->

### more “traditional” models for treating these problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am no longer the “accidental” psychiatrist. I know as I treat the body the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain will heal. And that’s no accident.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I want to tell you what I have learned and show you how to take

<!-- chunk -->

### advantage of this science now. I want to give you the tools you need to apply this

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine approach to your own life so you don’t have to wait twenty

<!-- chunk -->

### years for medical practices and the scientific community to catch up with what

<!-- chunk -->

### we already know today.

<!-- chunk -->

### The question that remains is how to treat these underlying causes, so you

<!-- chunk -->

### can rebalance your health and empower your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### What was I able to help Clayton achieve by identifying and treating the

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying factors that were driving his illness, and how did I do it? How can

<!-- chunk -->

### you use this same approach to help you overcome the “broken brain” that is so

<!-- chunk -->

### debilitating you?

# A New Road Map for Treating Disease: The Seven

# Keys to UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### A new road map has emerged for how the human body works and how to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat illnesses—whether they are mental or physical. This road map is not based

<!-- chunk -->

### on the traditional ways of naming and diagnosing disease (or the ICD-9 disease

<!-- chunk -->

### classification system that you will learn more about in chapter 3) but on the

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying, core, interlocking, physiological systems that, in fact, underlie all

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### No one element can explain Clayton’s constellation of symptoms, but his

<!-- chunk -->

### particular puzzle tells a unique story when taken as a whole. And while there

<!-- chunk -->

### may be similar patterns in other children with ADHD, his pattern is unique to

<!-- chunk -->

### him. Another child with ADHD might have different imbalances and require

<!-- chunk -->

### different diagnostic tests and therapies.

<!-- chunk -->

### My medical school training gave me the ability to diagnose thousands of

<!-- chunk -->

### different separate diseases. Diseases that I suggest don’t really exist in the way

<!-- chunk -->

### we think they do. We give names to disease like depression or ADHD, but that

<!-- chunk -->

### just helps us group people together who have the same symptoms for the

<!-- chunk -->

### purposes of giving them all the same drug therapy. But what if I were to tell you

<!-- chunk -->

### that new scientific discoveries tell us that there is no such thing as depression?

<!-- chunk -->

### What we see as the symptoms of depression are reflections of a few

<!-- chunk -->

### common interconnected imbalances in the body that have nothing to do with the

<!-- chunk -->

### medical specialties as we know them. Depression is not a psychiatric illness, but

<!-- chunk -->

### a systemic disease. To treat it we need to address the whole system—the

<!-- chunk -->

### ecosystem of your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### That means we need to understand how the whole body operates as a

<!-- chunk -->

### system, not just how different pieces of the body operate independently from one

<!-- chunk -->

### another. We need to treat people, not body parts; we want to treat the causes of

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, not symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### I was trained according to the dogma of separate medical specialties—for

<!-- chunk -->

### heart problems you see the cardiologist, for stomach problems you see the

<!-- chunk -->

### gastroenterologist, for joint pain you see the rheumatologist, for skin problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### the dermatologist. You just don’t ask the skin doctor about your joint pain. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### do ask, he or she will cut you off and tell you to see the joint doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### The road map I was given in medical school to navigate through the

<!-- chunk -->

### territory of illness was the wrong map. It taught us to diagnose disease and then

<!-- chunk -->

### assign standardized treatments no matter who was suffering. This is the wrong

<!-- chunk -->

### approach. It’s a map that sends us in the wrong direction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not only are your joint pains, skin rash, irritable bowel, and depression all

<!-- chunk -->

### connected, but the only way to find your way out of this mess of chronic disease

<!-- chunk -->

### (which affects 162 million people) is by using a new map—one that allows us to

<!-- chunk -->

### see how everything is connected.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is what the rich new method called Functional Medicine offers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine (www.functionalmedicine.org) applies the science of

<!-- chunk -->

### systems biology in a practical setting. It is the revolutionary new system I have

<!-- chunk -->

### been talking about. It’s a fundamental change in our thinking, a whole different

<!-- chunk -->

### paradigm, like the world-is-round-not-flat shift. It changes our approach to the

<!-- chunk -->

### very way we think about illness and the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### With it, we can truly treat and cure disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unlike conventional medicine, Functional Medicine personalizes treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### based on a patient’s unique needs. We are all different. We have a different

<!-- chunk -->

### genetic makeup. As a result our bodies react to our environment in different

<!-- chunk -->

### ways. Understanding this allows us to develop unique methods to treat people,

<!-- chunk -->

### not diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the heart of this paradigm shift are the seven keys of UltraWellness, the

<!-- chunk -->

### same keys that make up the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### All medicine can be simplied into a few basic principles and concepts or

<!-- chunk -->

### natural laws that explain all disease and suffering. These concepts are the seven

<!-- chunk -->

### keys or core systems of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part II I will explore how each of these keys affects your mood, behavior,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, memory, and overall brain function, and supply quizzes that will help

<!-- chunk -->

### you identify which of these keys is out of balance for you so you can optimize

<!-- chunk -->

### and heal your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This will give you a personalized road map for your journey back to health

<!-- chunk -->

### and wellness. It will help you heal from your broken brain and from a host of

<!-- chunk -->

### other symptoms you may be suffering with.

<!-- chunk -->

### I would like to give you an introduction to the keys now, as they are critical

<!-- chunk -->

### for understanding how the whole program works. As you read this, keep in mind

<!-- chunk -->

### that these keys are not really separate but interconnect and interact in a dynamic,

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid web.

# THE SEVEN KEYS: STAYING IN BALANCE

# KEY #1: OPTIMIZE NUTRITION

<!-- chunk -->

### We are made of the stuff we eat. Our biology, biochemistry, and

<!-- chunk -->

### physiology need certain raw materials to run optimally—the right balance

<!-- chunk -->

### and quality of protein, fats, carbohydrates, the right vitamins and minerals

<!-- chunk -->

### in the correct dose for each of us and all the colorful pigments in plant

<!-- chunk -->

### foods, called phytonutrients, that support our well-being and function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly all of us are nutritionally imbalanced in one way or another.

# KEY #2: BALANCE YOUR HORMONES

<!-- chunk -->

### Our hormones, including insulin, thyroid, sex hormones, stress

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, and many more, are a symphony of molecules. They have to

<!-- chunk -->

### work in harmony for you to be healthy.

# KEY #3: COOL OFF INFLAMMATION

<!-- chunk -->

### We must protect and defend ourselves from foreign invaders or

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormal cells inside our own body. When this is over-or underactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### illness occurs. Inflammation of the brain is a central theme for almost all

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric and neurologic conditions, as well as most chronic disease. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you have a broken brain it is almost certainly inflamed.

# KEY #4: FIX YOUR DIGESTION

<!-- chunk -->

### Digesting, absorbing, and assimilating all the food and nutrients we eat

<!-- chunk -->

### is critical for health. Our digestive systems must also protect us from

<!-- chunk -->

### internal toxins, bugs, and potential allergens, as well as eliminate wastes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Breakdown anywhere in this process creates illness.

# KEY #5: ENHANCE DETOXIFICATION

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies must eliminate all of our metabolic wastes and toxins,

<!-- chunk -->

### which we take in from the environment through our food, air, water, and

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. The toxic burden in the twenty-first century is overwhelming

<!-- chunk -->

### and often our bodies can’t keep up. This leads to illness.

# KEY #6: BOOST ENERGY METABOLISM

<!-- chunk -->

### Life is energy. Once no more energy is produced in your cells, you die.

<!-- chunk -->

### The process of extracting energy from the food you eat and the oxygen you

<!-- chunk -->

### breathe is the most essential process of life. Keeping that metabolic engine

<!-- chunk -->

### running smoothly and protecting it from harm are essential for health. Loss

<!-- chunk -->

### of energy is found in almost all brain disorders.

# KEY #7: CALM YOUR MIND

<!-- chunk -->

### A life of meaning and purpose, a life in balance with connection,

<!-- chunk -->

### community, love, support, and a sense of empowerment, are essential for

<!-- chunk -->

### health. The overwhelming stresses of the twenty-first century, including

<!-- chunk -->

### social isolation, overwork, and disempowerment, create enormous strain

<!-- chunk -->

### on our nervous system, leading to burnout and breakdown.

<!-- chunk -->

### By treating imbalances in these seven keys we now have a way to cure,

<!-- chunk -->

### stop, slow, and reverse this looming epidemic of “brain” disorders (as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### virtually all the diseases we see in the twenty-first century).

<!-- chunk -->

### But what creates these imbalances?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are these seven key systems out of balance because of poor diet, allergens,

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, stress, and toxins?

<!-- chunk -->

### Or are they out of balance because they are missing the essential raw

<!-- chunk -->

### materials for life and health—whole, real food rich in phytonutrients and fiber,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins and minerals, oxygen, clean water and air, light, sleep, exercise, deep

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation, love, connection and community, meaning, and purpose?

<!-- chunk -->

### More to the point, I want to know how these factors influence a person’s

<!-- chunk -->

### unique genome and their gene expression, creating their unique set of problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### You see, your genes are not fixed but capable of dynamically responding to

<!-- chunk -->

### information or instructions that come from your diet, lifestyle, and environment.

<!-- chunk -->

### The “information” you send your genes determines whether you stay well or get

<!-- chunk -->

### sick, and just how well you function day to day.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the study of nutrigenomics (the science of how food affects your

<!-- chunk -->

### genes), and it is the other critical piece of this new road map for healing disease

<!-- chunk -->

### outlined in The UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

## A New Approach to Understanding Food: Nutrigenomics

<!-- chunk -->

### The most powerful tool you have to change your brain and your health is

<!-- chunk -->

### your fork.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why?

<!-- chunk -->

### Food is not just calories or energy. Food contains information that talks to

<!-- chunk -->

### your genes, turning them on or off and affecting their function moment to

<!-- chunk -->

### moment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Food is the fastest-acting and most powerful medicine you can take to

<!-- chunk -->

### change your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### This discovery is called “nutrigenomics.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of your genes as the software that runs everything in your body. Just

<!-- chunk -->

### like your computer software, it only does what you instruct it to do with the

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke of your keyboard.

<!-- chunk -->

### The foods you eat are the keystrokes that send messages to your genes

<!-- chunk -->

### telling them what to do—creating health or disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imagine what messages you are sending with a double cheeseburger, large

<!-- chunk -->

### fries, and a forty-eight-ounce cola. Consider what messages you might send

<!-- chunk -->

### instead with deep red wild salmon, braised greens, and brown rice.

<!-- chunk -->

### The science of nutrigenomics allows us to personalize medicine—not

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone with the same problems needs the same prescription. Your individual

<!-- chunk -->

### genetic makeup determines what you need to be optimally healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have only about thirty thousand genes. But you have more than

<!-- chunk -->

### million little variations in those genes called SNPs (single nucleotide

<!-- chunk -->

### polymorphisms). Those variations make up who you are. And they make your

<!-- chunk -->

### individual needs slightly different from my individual needs. We all have

<!-- chunk -->

### different needs for food, vitamins, rest, exercise, stress tolerance, or ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### handle toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### This book is a map to help you personalize your road to UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### based on your strengths and vulnerabilities—your individual needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### By analyzing where you are out of balance in the seven keys to

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness and then applying the science of nutrigenomics to help reestablish

<!-- chunk -->

### balance, we can create treatments matched to each person’s individual needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is what you will learn how to do in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using this method, I now approach each encounter with a patient from a

<!-- chunk -->

### general framework that is completely different from the one I learned in medical

<!-- chunk -->

### school. I create a treatment plan that is not reproducible for a group of people

<!-- chunk -->

### with the same symptoms, but is, of necessity, created anew for each patient.

<!-- chunk -->

### What I do is actually quite simple.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first step is to take out the bad stuff (the things that create imbalance,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as a nutrient-poor, processed diet; toxins; allergens; infections; and stress);

<!-- chunk -->

### remove what’s bugging you. If you have ten tacks in your foot, you can’t take

<!-- chunk -->

### out one, pop an aspirin, and hope to feel better. You need to find and take out all

<!-- chunk -->

### the tacks; taking out just one of them won’t make you better.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second step is to add the good stuff (high-quality whole foods,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients, water, oxygen, light, movement, sleep, relaxation, community,

<!-- chunk -->

### connection, love, meaning, and purpose), and the body’s natural intelligence and

<!-- chunk -->

### healing system will take care of the rest. This is the foundation of The UltraMind


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s all there is to it. Using this simple, yet comprehensive, method

<!-- chunk -->

### allows me to treat virtually all diseases, whether they are “in the brain” or “in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body.” And it works for one simple reason: the body and the brain are one

<!-- chunk -->

### system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, common myths founded in classical psychiatry and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurology and promoted for decades by society have blinded us to the simple but

<!-- chunk -->

### profound truth Functional Medicine has unveiled.

<!-- chunk -->

### And we must understand these myths before we can be free of them.


# THE MYTHS OF PSYCHIATRY AND

# NEUROLOGY


<!-- chunk -->

### ... scientists cannot see the way they see with their way of seeing.

1 —R. D. LAING

<!-- chunk -->

### We are so used to looking at things in a certain way that we cannot see a

<!-- chunk -->

### different way of looking at the brain, behavior, and mood. As we begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### discover the nature of how the brain works and how its function is intimately

<!-- chunk -->

### connected to the rest of the core systems in the body, the medical myths that we

<!-- chunk -->

### have labored under, and that have blocked us from truly seeing the origins of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with our mood, memory, attention, and brain health, are falling away.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s review these myths and put them to rest.

# The Myth of Diagnosis: If You Know the Name of

# Your Disease, You Know What’s Wrong with You

<!-- chunk -->

### This myth is pervasive throughout medicine not just in psychiatry and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurology, and it is the single biggest obstacle to changing the way we do things

<!-- chunk -->

### and finding the answers to our health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is simply this—we are in the naming and blaming game in

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. It is what we were trained to do. Find the name of the “disease,” then

<!-- chunk -->

### match the drug to the disease. You have “depression,” so you need an

<!-- chunk -->

### “antidepressant.” You are “anxious,” so you need an “antianxiety” medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have bipolar disease or mood swings, so you need a “mood stabilizer.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, this approach or method of thinking is outdated, increasingly

<!-- chunk -->

### useless, and often dangerous. In some ways it’s even tyrannical. Once you have a

<!-- chunk -->

### label, you are put in the group of people who have the same label, and it is

<!-- chunk -->

### assumed you carry the attributes of this group.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, a group of psychologists, psychiatrists, and lawyers headed by

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. David Rosenhan, a Stanford University professor of law and psychology,

<!-- chunk -->

### pretended to be hearing voices and got themselves admitted to psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### hospitals across the country.


<!-- chunk -->

### Once they were admitted to the hospitals, they resumed acting normally.

<!-- chunk -->

### The hospital staff and physicians then viewed all their “normal behavior,” such

<!-- chunk -->

### as note taking, as “abnormal.” It was only the regular “crazy” patients who could

<!-- chunk -->

### tell them apart!

<!-- chunk -->

### The same thing happens to you once we assign you a label like depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, ADHD, or dementia. We throw you in the same group with

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone else who has that diagnosis and assume you all have the same problem,

<!-- chunk -->

### even if evidence is found to the contrary.

<!-- chunk -->

### But these labels or diagnoses are just names we associate with a collection

<!-- chunk -->

### of symptoms. This name has nothing to do with why you have those symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### —with the root causes of the “disease.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s another example. When you go see a psychiatrist or psychologist,

<!-- chunk -->

### you are given the label “depression” if you meet the criteria agreed upon by the

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric community and outlined in the classic manual of the American

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatric Association, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

<!-- chunk -->

### Disorders IV (DSM-IV).

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is the list of features for depression from the DSM-IV:

<!-- chunk -->

### Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either

<!-- chunk -->

### subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others

<!-- chunk -->

### (e.g., appears tearful). (In children and adolescents, this may be

<!-- chunk -->

### characterized as an irritable mood.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities

<!-- chunk -->

### most of the day, nearly every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of

<!-- chunk -->

### more than five pounds of body weight in a month), or decrease or

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in appetite nearly every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Insomnia or hypersomnia (sleeping too much) nearly every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every

<!-- chunk -->

### day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every

<!-- chunk -->

### day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal

<!-- chunk -->

### ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt, or a specific plan

<!-- chunk -->

### for committing suicide.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are even subtypes of depression such as mild, moderate, and severe,

<!-- chunk -->

### with and without psychotic features, chronic, catatonic, melancholic, atypical,

<!-- chunk -->

### and more outlined in a similar manner.

<!-- chunk -->

### And there are literally thousands of different distinctions like these made

<!-- chunk -->

### for the major “mental diseases” cataloged in the DSM-IV. They include disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### of childhood, delirium, dementia, or cognitive disorders, substance abuse

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, and sleep disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this description of depression (and of all the other mental disorders in

<!-- chunk -->

### the DSM-IV) is only of the symptoms we observe. These descriptions tell us

<!-- chunk -->

### nothing at all about why those symptoms occur, or how people with exactly the

<!-- chunk -->

### same symptoms may have them for many different underlying reasons and need

<!-- chunk -->

### different and individualized treatment as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

### At a recent dinner for Research! America (an advocacy group for research

<!-- chunk -->

### and dissemination of research) in Washington, D.C., I sat with the surgeon

<!-- chunk -->

### general and the director of the National Institutes of Mental Health, Thomas

<!-- chunk -->

### Insel, M.D. The discussion around the dinner table focused on the limitations of

<!-- chunk -->

### our current approach of breaking down the body into its component parts to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand how things work.

<!-- chunk -->

### I asked Dr. Insel what he thought of the DSM-IV. He said that it has

<!-- chunk -->

### percent accuracy, but 0 percent validity—that it provides a perfect way to

<!-- chunk -->

### describe symptoms, but has nothing to tell us about the underlying biology for

<!-- chunk -->

### what causes them.

<!-- chunk -->

### He proposed a new model of psychiatry, called “Clinical Neuroscience,”

<!-- chunk -->

### which would encompass the entire spectrum of things that affect the mind and

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. We discussed the need for the medical establishment to move beyond

<!-- chunk -->

### its current limited model of diagnosis (both in psychiatry and the rest of

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine). It no longer reflects the science or our understanding of how the body

<!-- chunk -->

### works.

<!-- chunk -->

### The future of medicine is personalized treatment, not “one size fits all.” The

<!-- chunk -->

### outdated method of naming the disease and then assigning a drug to fix it clearly

<!-- chunk -->

### isn’t working.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, few in the medical industry today seem to understand this.

<!-- chunk -->

### The truth is that medical practice is virtually predicated on the myth of

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to help you understand how serious this problem is, because it is the

<!-- chunk -->

### basis of everything I am explaining in this book. It is not trivial because it

<!-- chunk -->

### changes everything about how we think about disease and what to do about it.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a two-volume book medical professionals use called the ICD-9

<!-- chunk -->

### (The International Classification of Diseases). It is the bible of medical

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis. It is the system used by medical insurance companies and Medicare to

<!-- chunk -->

### decide who gets paid. Doctors have to “name” the disease they are treating based

<!-- chunk -->

### on the ICD-9 to collect their money from these agencies!

<!-- chunk -->

### The book contains the name of every single disease known. There are more

<!-- chunk -->

### than 12,000 diseases listed. The ICD-9 gives the impression that all these

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases are separate and distinct.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is only one problem. They are not.

<!-- chunk -->

### A very few fundamental problems exist that explain nearly every disease. It

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t matter what specialty your disease falls under. As Pierre Laplace, the

<!-- chunk -->

### eighteenth-century mathematician and astronomer, said in his Mecanique

<!-- chunk -->

### Celeste, a very few fundamental laws can explain an extraordinary number of

<!-- chunk -->

### very complex phenomena.


<!-- chunk -->

### These underlying problems are the link between all of the diseases in the

<!-- chunk -->

### ICD-9. In almost every one of the diseases listed in that “bible,” the same few

<!-- chunk -->

### things go wrong. And those same few problems are all interconnected. One

<!-- chunk -->

### affects the other in a giant web of biology. Pull on one part of the web, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### whole web moves.

<!-- chunk -->

### This web is built of the seven keys of UltraWellness. These keys are the

<!-- chunk -->

### underlying causes of all illness. And they are the keys that lead to an UltraMind.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the common pathways for all disease. Wherever you look,

<!-- chunk -->

### whatever problem you have, once you learn how to analyze these seven keys,

<!-- chunk -->

### you will find they are the root of all your health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s all we need.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once we learn how to navigate health and disease using these concepts, we

<!-- chunk -->

### can throw the two-volume ICD-9 manual in the garbage, because it is the wrong

<!-- chunk -->

### road map for the territory of illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### This new road map turns the myth of diagnosis on its head, and in doing so

<!-- chunk -->

### reveals one of the most radical concepts that emerges from this new medical

<!-- chunk -->

### approach: the name of the disease bears little relationship to the cause of the

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## One Disease, Many Causes—One Cause, Many Diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### One disease can have many, many different causes, all of which manifest the

<!-- chunk -->

### same symptoms. Take depression, for example. It may be caused by many

<!-- chunk -->

### different factors, yet the symptoms we see are the same across the board. The

<!-- chunk -->

### DSM-IV accurately describes these symptoms (100 percent accuracy), but it says

<!-- chunk -->

### nothing at all about the causes (0 percent validity).

<!-- chunk -->

### Imagine a room full of people with depression. They all meet the DSMIV

<!-- chunk -->

### criteria for depression, and they would all be prescribed antidepressants for their

<!-- chunk -->

### “disease.”

<!-- chunk -->

### However, neither this diagnosis nor the treatment provided takes into

<!-- chunk -->

### account their genetic individuality. It doesn’t tease out the reasons each of them

<!-- chunk -->

### became depressed in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### These problems arise because the real causes of depression are not

<!-- chunk -->

### addressed with antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### It may be there are many “depressions,” not just one generic “depression.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These “depressions” may be the result of a multitude of causes: folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , or B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency; low thyroid function; “brain allergies”* to foods; an autoimmune

†

<!-- chunk -->

### response to gluten that inflames the brain; mercury poisoning; abnormal proteins

<!-- chunk -->

### called gluteo-or caseomorphins from poorly digested food that alter brain

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry; brain inflammation from a hidden infection; blood-sugar imbalances;

<!-- chunk -->

### low testosterone or other sex hormones; a deficiency of omega-3 fats; or adrenal-

<!-- chunk -->

### gland dysfunction from excessive stress among many other possible causes.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are some of the real causes of “depression” as well as many other

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness and neurological conditions. Without addressing core, underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### issues like these, we can never have optimal brain function or mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is really no such thing as the “disease” called depression, just many

<!-- chunk -->

### different systemic imbalances that cause the symptoms we collectively refer to

<!-- chunk -->

### as “depression.” One disease, many causes...

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other side of the spectrum, there can be one factor in a person’s diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### lifestyle, environment, or genetic makeup that can cause dozens of different and

<!-- chunk -->

### seemingly unrelated “diseases.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten, the protein found in the most common grain eaten in America—

<!-- chunk -->

### wheat—as well as barley, rye, oats, spelt, triticale, and kamut, is an excellent

<!-- chunk -->

### example. Gluten is one common factor that can create so many illnesses and

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases it would be hard to count them all.

<!-- chunk -->

### The reasons are many. They include our lack of genetic adaptation to

<!-- chunk -->

### grasses, and particularly gluten in our diet. Wheat was introduced into Europe

<!-- chunk -->

### during the Middle Ages, and 30 percent of those of European descent carry the

<!-- chunk -->

### gene for celiac disease (HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8),


<!-- chunk -->

### which increases susceptibility

<!-- chunk -->

### to health problems from eating gluten. Keep in mind that American strains of

<!-- chunk -->

### wheat have a much higher gluten content (which is needed to make light fluffy

<!-- chunk -->

### Wonder Bread).

<!-- chunk -->

### A recent review paper in The New England Journal of Medicine listed

<!-- chunk -->

### fiftyfive “diseases” that can be caused by eating gluten.


<!-- chunk -->

### These include many

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological and psychiatric diseases such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia,

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, migraines, epilepsy, and neuropathy (nerve damage).


<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten has also

<!-- chunk -->

### been linked to autism.


<!-- chunk -->

### Besides making the brain inflamed, gluten can be broken down in the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### into odd little proteins that are almost like psychedelic drugs (opiumlike peptides

<!-- chunk -->

### called gluteomorphins). These change brain function and behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten also contains significant amounts of glutamate, a molecule that

<!-- chunk -->

### accelerates, activates, excites, and damages brain cells through a special brain

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor or docking station called the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overactivation of this receptor by glutamate is implicated in many psychiatric


<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamate is called an excitotoxin (a substance which overexcites

<!-- chunk -->

### and kills or damages brain cells).

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten can cause brain dysfunction by three different mechanisms—

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, odd morphine or psychedelic proteins, and as an excitotoxin.


<!-- chunk -->

### So gluten, we see, can be the single cause behind many different “diseases.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These diseases are not treatable with better medication, but simply by

<!-- chunk -->

### percent elimination of gluten from the diet. One cause, many diseases...

<!-- chunk -->

### One disease caused by multiple factors, one factor that causes multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases? How could this happen? It completely upsets our current thinking. And

<!-- chunk -->

### it should!

<!-- chunk -->

### But the reason this is true is simpler than you might think.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are all unique, biochemically and genetically, and have different

<!-- chunk -->

### responses to the same insults. In one person gluten may cause arthritis, in

<!-- chunk -->

### another it can cause depression. Depression may be caused by gluten in one

<!-- chunk -->

### person; in another it may be caused by B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### The beauty of Functional Medicine, the seven keys to UltraWellness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the science of nutrigenomics is that they take these factors into account to help

<!-- chunk -->

### create health for each individual.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicine has been looking for answers in the wrong place. Finally, science

<!-- chunk -->

### has provided a gateway to a different way of thinking about mental illness and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain disorders. We need to get out of the name-it, blame-it, and tame-it game—

<!-- chunk -->

### the myth of diagnosis—and start thinking about how the body works, how to

<!-- chunk -->

### personalize our approach, and how not to suppress symptoms but to restore

<!-- chunk -->

### normal function.

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution leverages all of these new methods of

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding health and illness to help you sort through the real causes of your

<!-- chunk -->

### broken brain and get to the root of the problem, not just stay stuck with the name

<!-- chunk -->

### of your disease and the limited options available for treating it in this outdated

<!-- chunk -->

### paradigm.

# The Myth of Medication: Drugs Are the Answer to

# Mental Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to let you in on a little secret...

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression is not a Prozac deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### The real problem with conventional medical training is that doctors are not

<!-- chunk -->

### trained to be healers, but to be pharmacologists (except for surgeons). This

<!-- chunk -->

### problem is a direct consequence of the myth of diagnosis. We are trained to

<!-- chunk -->

### name the disease, and then assign a medication to treat it.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if the causes of a disease can be radically different in a given group of

<!-- chunk -->

### people, why should we believe that a “one-size-fits-all” prescription of

<!-- chunk -->

### medications would work to treat those underlying causes of the disease?

<!-- chunk -->

### Medications can be lifesaving, and are incredibly useful if given in the right

<!-- chunk -->

### dose, for the right person, at the right time, for the right reason. But the problem

<!-- chunk -->

### in medical practice today is that our only tools are medications. The old adage,

<!-- chunk -->

### “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” applies to medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### today.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best or right treatment for any particular condition may be ignored,

<!-- chunk -->

### because all we have studied and used are medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are sleep-deprived you can increase alertness and energy with a

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant medication, but the “right” treatment is sleep. If you are depressed

<!-- chunk -->

### because your intestine is inflamed and you are not absorbing vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , Prozac

<!-- chunk -->

### may help you feel a little better, but the treatment is fixing your gut and

<!-- chunk -->

### replacing B


<!-- chunk -->

### This all seems obvious enough, and in fact is common sense, but it is so far

<!-- chunk -->

### away from how doctors are trained and how we currently practice medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our goal in medicine should be to find the right “medicine” for each

<!-- chunk -->

### person, without prejudice, whether it is a drug, a nutrient, diet change,

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification, a hormone, exercise, or exorcism! We must embrace whatever

<!-- chunk -->

### works, and inquire into its effectiveness with all our scientific, economic, and

<!-- chunk -->

### political resources.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a look at the main categories of medicine for the brain:

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants (such as Prozac), stimulants (such as Ritalin), and tranquilizers

<!-- chunk -->

### (such as Valium and major tranquilizers such as Risperdal). Do they work? Are

<!-- chunk -->

### they safe? What problems are associated with them? Is there a better alternative

<!-- chunk -->

### to medications like these, one that addresses the underlying causes of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness and brain dysfunction?

<!-- chunk -->

### These mood-altering drugs are the fastest-growing segment of the

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical market, and as a group constitute the second-biggest class of

<!-- chunk -->

### medication in total sales and prescriptions. In children alone over the three-year

<!-- chunk -->

### period from 1997 to 2000, the use of antipsychotic medication increased by

<!-- chunk -->

### percent, atypical antidepressants by 42 percent, and SSRIs (selective serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### reuptake inhibitors—they are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants) by

<!-- chunk -->

### 18 percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### The global use of ADHD medication rose 300 percent from

<!-- chunk -->

### to 2000.


<!-- chunk -->

### What’s worse is that the use of untested and potentially unsafe

<!-- chunk -->

### combinations of psychotropic drug cocktails has increased 500 percent in

<!-- chunk -->

### children. The authors of the study that pointed this out warned that our

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribing practices are not in sync with our current knowledge.


<!-- chunk -->

### In other

<!-- chunk -->

### words, our current research does not support these drug-cocktail combinations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Concerns about overuse extend to adults as well as children. In fact, Eli

<!-- chunk -->

### Lilly, the maker of the antipsychotic drug called Zyprexa, has already paid $1.2

<!-- chunk -->

### billion to settle thirty thousand lawsuits from people who claim that Zyprexa

<!-- chunk -->

### caused them to develop diabetes or other diseases, and is also alleged to have

<!-- chunk -->

### promoted Zyprexa for unapproved off-label use, which it denies. Drug

<!-- chunk -->

### companies cannot actively promote drugs for off-label uses, but doctors can

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribe them for such uses. (For example, Zyprexa is approved for

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia but doctors also prescribe it for anxiety.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Do we really need medications to keep us from being sad, hyper, anxious,

<!-- chunk -->

### or psychotic?

<!-- chunk -->

### Today modern psychopharmacologists dispense drugs like candy despite

<!-- chunk -->

### their limited effectiveness. Often these drugs are administered in untested

<!-- chunk -->

### cocktails and combinations, which may occasionally be helpful, but come with

<!-- chunk -->

### more side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consider the rather astonishing example of antipsychotics or major

<!-- chunk -->

### tranquilizers (including Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, and Geodon). This class

<!-- chunk -->

### of medications is one of the biggest-growing sectors in drug sales. Antipsychotic

<!-- chunk -->

### usage has shown a 10 to 20 percent rate of increase per year over the last few

<!-- chunk -->

### years and today sales of these drugs total about $12 billion a year.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditionally such medications were reserved for psychosis, defined as an

<!-- chunk -->

### inability to distinguish what’s real from what’s imagined. Hearing voices and

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking that aliens are visiting your bedroom at night are examples of

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### But now, with little hesitation or scientific evidence, antipsychotics are

<!-- chunk -->

### given to children with behavioral problems, autism, and ADHD, and to adults

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### These drugs can lead to serious side effects. Besides acting like a chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### straitjacket and making people dull, slow, and stupid, they increase the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity, diabetes, stroke, blood clots, and more serious conditions known as

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroleptic malignant syndrome (where your body literally burns up with fever

<!-- chunk -->

### and your muscles are destroyed) and tardive dyskinesia (uncontrolled repetitive,

<!-- chunk -->

### involuntary, and purposeless movements such as lip smacking, rapid eye

<!-- chunk -->

### blinking, grimacing, and spasms in the legs).

<!-- chunk -->

### Have we suddenly all gone crazy?

<!-- chunk -->

### What most consumers don’t understand is that drug testing is often very

<!-- chunk -->

### limited before drug approval. New drugs are tested on a few hundred to a few

<!-- chunk -->

### thousand people often for a very limited time (usually a few weeks to a few

<!-- chunk -->

### months). Then they are released on the market, supported by more than $30

<!-- chunk -->

### billion in pharmaceutical advertising dollars (or about $25,000 a year for each

<!-- chunk -->

### one of the 737,000 physicians in America).

<!-- chunk -->

### Once approved, these drugs can be prescribed for any use.

<!-- chunk -->

### We in the medical industry call these “off-label uses.”

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, the drug may be approved only for use in schizophrenia (as in

<!-- chunk -->

### the examples of antipsychotics above). But doctors can prescribe it for anyone

<!-- chunk -->

### they like—from someone who is overly anxious to someone with obsessive-

<!-- chunk -->

### compulsive disorder to a child whose behavior is out of control.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once the drug is approved, there is no official tracking of its risks or

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits to the millions who are prescribed the drug. It’s left up to patients or

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors to self-report problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### This leaves the public very vulnerable. Doctors are using the only tools they

<!-- chunk -->

### know how to use, but that’s the way they get into trouble.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, it appears that drug companies often see any backlash or

<!-- chunk -->

### lawsuits as simply part of their “research and development” expenses of their

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bloomberg News reported in December 2006:

<!-- chunk -->

### Nationwide, several lawsuits accuse drug companies of engaging in

<!-- chunk -->

### deceptive marketing by overstating the effectiveness and understating the

<!-- chunk -->

### risks of newer antipsychotics. The suits also claim companies promoted the

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs for unapproved uses. Mississippi, Louisiana, Alaska and West

<!-- chunk -->

### Virginia sued Eli Lilly & Co. this year on behalf of their Medicaid health

<!-- chunk -->

### programs for the poor. They said the company fraudulently touted the

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotic Zyprexa for unapproved uses. Indianapolis-based Lilly settled

<!-- chunk -->

### about eight thousand personal-injury complaints for $700 million in

<!-- chunk -->

### and faces four thousand more claims.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are a drug-addicted society, and we are overprescribed medication when

<!-- chunk -->

### there are better solutions. According to The Journal of the American Medical

<!-- chunk -->

### Association, in an average week 81 percent of Americans use at least one

<!-- chunk -->

### medication, 50 percent take at least one prescription drug, and 7 percent take

<!-- chunk -->

### five or more drugs. Of those over sixty-five years old, 12 percent take at least ten

<!-- chunk -->

### medications and 23 percent take at least five medications.


<!-- chunk -->

### This bias toward medication sadly distracts us from finding the real or best

<!-- chunk -->

### answers to our ailments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, the billions of dollars that pour into the pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### industry every year are not spent researching or promoting changes in diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrient therapies, detoxification, addressing food allergies, and other potentially

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial treatments. Instead, our economy thrives on products and services that

<!-- chunk -->

### make us sick or benefit from our illness (drugs, processed foods, fast foods, and

<!-- chunk -->

### companies that thrive by adding to our environmental toxic load).

<!-- chunk -->

### Who knows where we would be if such research were being done.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next frontier in medicine, psychiatry, and neurology is realizing that

<!-- chunk -->

### depression is not a Prozac deficiency, ADHD is not a Ritalin deficiency, and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia is not a Zyprexa deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have the tools and knowledge now to make an enormous difference in

<!-- chunk -->

### this epidemic of mental and brain disorders by looking deeper and thinking

<!-- chunk -->

### differently.

<!-- chunk -->

## Getting off medications can be difficult, comes with certain risks, and

<!-- chunk -->

## must be done under a physician’s supervision. I don’t recommend anyone

<!-- chunk -->

### stop using their medications suddenly, but I do suggest that by following the plan

<!-- chunk -->

### to optimize your brain function and address the underlying causes of mood

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders and brain dysfunction in The UltraMind Solution, many people can get

<!-- chunk -->

### off their medications with their physician’s help and feel better and healthier

<!-- chunk -->

### than ever.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fix your body and you will fix your brain.

# The Myth of Psychotherapy: You Can Talk or

# Meditate Away Your Mood and Brain Problems

<!-- chunk -->

### We must all learn to deal with the infestation of ANTS in our brains if we

<!-- chunk -->

### want to be happy. The ANTS are “automatic negative thoughts,” or our beliefs,

<!-- chunk -->

### attitudes, and ways of thinking and being that move us away from well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Counseling, therapy, coaching, cognitive behavioral therapy, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### psychoanalysis can be essential components of an overall plan for mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### But if you are mercury poisoned, or deficient in folic acid, or have

<!-- chunk -->

### lowthyroid function, or drink twelve cups of coffee a day, or eat half a pound of

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar a day (the amount consumed by the average American), or have an

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed brain from eating gluten, it is very difficult to talk or meditate your way

<!-- chunk -->

### out of your suffering.

<!-- chunk -->

### I believe you must address the biological causes of the problems first before

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapy can be effective. Fix your biology. Then get psychotherapy and

<!-- chunk -->

### do your soul work.

<!-- chunk -->

## Addressing the underlying imbalances in your body that cause brain

<!-- chunk -->

## dysfunction will allow you to venture more deeply and successfully into the

<!-- chunk -->

## exploration of your mind and your soul.

<!-- chunk -->

### We all want to fully wake up, be happy, and completely feel the joys and

<!-- chunk -->

### pleasures of love, work, and play that give life its meaning and purpose.

<!-- chunk -->

### But we can achieve that only by working on both our biology and our

<!-- chunk -->

### biography!

<!-- chunk -->

### We can use the best of psychoemotional and behavioral therapies, but we

<!-- chunk -->

### must optimize brain function through improving nutrition; stabilizing immune

<!-- chunk -->

### function, hormone, and neurotransmitter balance; enhancing detoxification;

<!-- chunk -->

### normalizing digestive function; and boosting the energy in our cells.

# The Brain-Body Separation Myth: Your Brain Is

# Protected from Your Body

<!-- chunk -->

### The idea that the brain and the body are separated is a solid, well-established

<!-- chunk -->

### belief. All doctors are trained in the absolute nature of the blood–brain barrier—

<!-- chunk -->

### a wall of tightly packed cells lining the smallest blood vessels of the brain, called

<!-- chunk -->

### capillaries, and a back-up defensive team of astrocytes (star-shaped cells of the

<!-- chunk -->

### glia) that holds this tightly packed wall together.

<!-- chunk -->

### This barrier is designed to keep out toxic influences and infections, but let

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically necessary ingredients like sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids

<!-- chunk -->

### through.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because we know this barrier exists, we believe that what happens in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain stays in the brain and what happens in the body stays in the body. Like an

<!-- chunk -->

### iron curtain, that barrier is never breached.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is only one problem with this theory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The blood–brain barrier is really just a partial barrier.

<!-- chunk -->

### We now know the brain can become leaky and the barrier permeable under

<!-- chunk -->

### many conditions—poor nutrition, stress, infection, digestive imbalances, toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### injury, and allergy. The brain, in fact, reads what is happening in the rest of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body even under normal conditions of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### What you do to your body you do to your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a brief look at childhood autism and Alzheimer’s to illustrate the

<!-- chunk -->

### frailty of the myth that the brain is walled off from the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Autism: A Body Disorder That Affects the Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Martha Herbert is an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical

<!-- chunk -->

### School and the director of TRANSCEND (Treatment, Research, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuroscience Evaluation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders). Her work in autism

<!-- chunk -->

### is paradigm-shifting scientific research and thinking.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rather than ignoring the almost universal physical complaints found in

<!-- chunk -->

### autistic children, most of which have been described in the scientific literature

<!-- chunk -->

### since the 1940s, she explains how they could be at the root of the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### behavioral symptoms found in autistic children.

<!-- chunk -->

### In her groundbreaking article in Clinical Neuropsychiatry entitled “Autism:

<!-- chunk -->

### A brain disorder, or a disorder that affects the brain?”


<!-- chunk -->

### she explains how the

<!-- chunk -->

### incoherent brain connections found in children with autism, which show up as

<!-- chunk -->

### the inability to talk, connect with other people, or produce odd repetitive

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors, have their root not in the brain but in problems with the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### system and the immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### These breakdowns in the body, which lead to behavioral problems, occur

<!-- chunk -->

### because of genetic susceptibilities, which are amplified by environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### stresses and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why, she asks, do 95 to 100 percent of autistic children have

<!-- chunk -->

### gastrointestinal dysfunction, or 70 percent of them have immune system

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities? After examining all the accumulated research on autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### including her own work on brain imaging and the structure and function of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain in autistic children, she concludes that autism is not a brain disorder, but a

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic disorder that affects the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, she challenges the idea that there is only one kind of autism. She

<!-- chunk -->

### says there may be many “autisms,” because each child has unique genetic and

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental factors that can lead to the same symptoms and behaviors. (This

<!-- chunk -->

### goes back to the myth of the diagnosis—having the name of the problem doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### tell you about the cause or causes.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Herbert noticed that brains of autistic children are bigger, swollen

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps. These swollen brains are filled with activated immune cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory molecules.


<!-- chunk -->

### Where is this inflammation coming from?

<!-- chunk -->

### It starts outside the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### She describes autism as a “metabolic encephalopathy.” In nonmedical

<!-- chunk -->

### language that means that all the information and noise from outside the brain—

<!-- chunk -->

### from the gut, from the immune system, and from toxins—are causing the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### to malfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a 180-degree turn from conventional thinking. If an altered response

<!-- chunk -->

### to a microbe or bug in the body by the immune system can affect brain function,

<!-- chunk -->

### or if a molecule made in the gut can change behavior or perception, then of

<!-- chunk -->

### course the brain is in communication with the rest of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### With autism we see clearly the effects of systemic imbalances in the body

<!-- chunk -->

### on the brain and mind. And what holds true of autism holds true of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders like depression, Alzheimer’s, and a host of others as well.

<!-- chunk -->

## A Sweet Brain: Slow as Molasses

<!-- chunk -->

### Also out of Harvard is the work of pioneering neurologist Dennis Selkoe,


<!-- chunk -->

### who has linked sugar and its ability to create insulin resistance, metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome (or prediabetes), and diabetes to Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, some researchers are calling Alzheimer’s “type 3” diabetes. People

<!-- chunk -->

### with type 2 diabetes have four times the risk of getting Alzheimer’s compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### those without diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### We will explore this connection between diabetes and Alzheimer’s a little

<!-- chunk -->

### later in Part II when I discuss hormonal imbalances, but the take-home message

<!-- chunk -->

### here is that our diet, the sugar and processed food we eat, has a clear effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### our brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your brain was walled off from the rest of your body, then how could this

<!-- chunk -->

### happen? The answer is that your brain is not walled off, and is in fact intimately

<!-- chunk -->

### connected to everything else going on in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that even people with prediabetes have a higher risk of cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### decline, poor memory, and loss of brain function.


<!-- chunk -->

### So when you have that soda,

<!-- chunk -->

### some imaginary barrier does not protect your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### How could we really believe that our brains could tolerate half a pound of

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar a day on average and be healthy?

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other examples of how great an influence the body (and

<!-- chunk -->

### what you put in your body) can have on your brain, some more of which you

<!-- chunk -->

### will learn about over the course of this book. But here is the bottom line...

<!-- chunk -->

### All broken brains have their root in the body. They are not localized to that

<!-- chunk -->

### three pounds of custardlike gray stuff between your ears!

<!-- chunk -->

### The body and brain interact as one system. Don’t be deceived. The barrier

<!-- chunk -->

### between them is no iron curtain. It is more like cheesecloth.

# The Brain Cell Myth: Once You Lose Brain Cells,

# They Are Gone Forever

<!-- chunk -->

### We all learned that once you lose brain cells, that’s it, they’re gone forever.

<!-- chunk -->

### We thought too many nights partying in college, or long-term stress or trauma,

<!-- chunk -->

### which injure the brain, were irreparable. And clearly brain damage and loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain activity from stroke or even cerebral palsy cannot be recovered.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or so we thought...

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the most exciting research on the brain in the last decade has

<!-- chunk -->

### clearly shown that the brain can heal, renew, repair, and regenerate itself. You

<!-- chunk -->

### can make new brain cells (neurogenesis), you can wake up and activate damaged

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells, and you can improve connections between brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### (neuroplasticity), all of which lead to improved cognitive function and

<!-- chunk -->

### remarkable recoveries.

<!-- chunk -->

### This discovery has now been replicated over and over. It is a whole new

<!-- chunk -->

### field of scientific inquiry called “neurogenesis,” or the creation of new brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### We have long known of the brain’s ability to stretch. It is what we call

<!-- chunk -->

### plasticity. You can train areas of your brain to take over lost function and make

<!-- chunk -->

### enormous accommodations even under very extreme circumstances.

<!-- chunk -->

### I know a little girl who was born with half a brain, and though she has some

<!-- chunk -->

### small motor problems and a few little quirks, if you met her you would never

<!-- chunk -->

### know she only had one half of her brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But brain regeneration and renewal go far beyond that. The implications for

<!-- chunk -->

### reversing dementia and affecting mood disorders are staggering.

<!-- chunk -->

### If it’s true that you can grow new brain cells, the question really becomes:

<!-- chunk -->

### how do we accelerate and facilitate the process of neurogenesis? How do we

<!-- chunk -->

### help our brains heal and grow?

<!-- chunk -->

### The key areas that regenerate are the hippocampus, a walnut-sized area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain that controls much of our mood and memory, and the olfactory (smell)

<!-- chunk -->

### center of the brain. We now know that hormones, growth factors (fertilizer for

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells), new learning, neurotransmitters (brain messenger chemicals), and

<!-- chunk -->

### physical exercise can promote new brain cell formation.

<!-- chunk -->

### We also know that stress, drugs, toxins, and anything that causes

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation can damage the hippocampus, kill brain cells, and reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### neurogenesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The key to optimal brain health is doing more of the things that help

<!-- chunk -->

### generate new brain cells and less of the things that kill brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, we know that the stress hormone cortisol injures the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus, damages brain cells, and leads to memory loss and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Conversely, we know that reducing cortisol levels with relaxation increases the

<!-- chunk -->

### size of the hippocampus through neurogenesis.

<!-- chunk -->

### So the next time you get stressed out, think about how you are killing your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells and take a deep breath instead.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, there is hope to rebuild your brain and reverse conditions we

<!-- chunk -->

### thought permanent, such as autism and dementia, as well as depression and other

<!-- chunk -->

### mood disorders. You just need to know how to do it.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first step is understanding that the myths outlined in this chapter are

<!-- chunk -->

### just that—myths. If you are suffering from a “mental illness” like depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, or bipolar disorder, a “brain disorder” like Alzheimer’s disease, or

<!-- chunk -->

### simply suffer from a bad mood, there are underlying root causes that are putting

<!-- chunk -->

### your system out of balance and creating these conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just because you got labeled or diagnosed with a disease does not mean you

<!-- chunk -->

### know what’s wrong with you. You probably don’t need more and better

<!-- chunk -->

### medications to overcome your “illness.” Psychotherapy may help, but on its own

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s unlikely to be as effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fix your body and you will fix your broken brain and boost your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### power. The body-and-brain are not walled off from each other. What you put in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body affects your brain. In fact, it may mean the difference between

<!-- chunk -->

### growing new brain cells and living with the same old diminished brain you are

<!-- chunk -->

### living with right now.

<!-- chunk -->

### The second step is taking the “tacks” out of your brain—eliminating

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental and dietary factors that have been proven to cause your “broken

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the real causes of your mood, memory, and cognition problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### and it is only by eliminating or reducing them that you will rebalance your body

<!-- chunk -->

### and restore your brain function.


# WHY YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM

# BRAIN DAMAGE

<!-- chunk -->

## Learning How to Protect Your Brain


<!-- chunk -->

### A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and

<!-- chunk -->

### making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a

<!-- chunk -->

### new generation grows up that is familiar with it.

—MAX PLANCK

<!-- chunk -->

### Our brains are the most sensitive organs in our bodies, and they respond

<!-- chunk -->

### immediately and almost instantly to insults.

<!-- chunk -->

### So stop insulting your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us have no clue that sitting around on our couch watching TV hurts

<!-- chunk -->

### our brain. So does losing a few hours of sleep at night, drinking a can of cola,

<!-- chunk -->

### having that Starbucks grande latte, getting the flu vaccine, having those two

<!-- chunk -->

### glasses of chardonnay, taking a few Rolaids for heartburn, eating strawberries

<!-- chunk -->

### grown on a conventional farm, having a fight with our spouse, and talking on our

<!-- chunk -->

### cell phones for a few hours a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Save your brain. Learn what harms and what enhances it. Understand why

<!-- chunk -->

### you are brain damaged and how to prevent—even reverse—it. The data is in. We

<!-- chunk -->

### know what the harmful influences are on brain function. We know how these

<!-- chunk -->

### influences alter our mood; promote depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, Parkinson’s; and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### I will review all of these insults in detail in Part II. There I will show you

<!-- chunk -->

### how different environmental influences, dietary factors, and other toxins can

<!-- chunk -->

### influence and create imbalances in each of the seven key systems in your body,

<!-- chunk -->

### and, as a result, affect your brain and your overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

### For now, I want to summarize the big picture so you can begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the environmental and dietary influences that affect your brain, how

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain is getting damaged, and how you can protect and care for it in the

<!-- chunk -->

### future.

# Toxic Foods

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two toxic foods that everyone should eliminate from their diet

<!-- chunk -->

### today, immediately. In fact, go right now to your cupboard and throw out

<!-- chunk -->

### everything with these two ingredients because they damage your brain (and the

<!-- chunk -->

### rest of your body as well). But be prepared. There may be nothing left in your

<!-- chunk -->

### cupboard.

<!-- chunk -->

## High-Fructose Corn Syrup (and Any Form of Sugar or Refined

<!-- chunk -->

## Carbohydrate)

<!-- chunk -->

### High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is an insidious chemical that has crept into

<!-- chunk -->

### our food supply in recent years. Though it was completely unknown until 1980,

<!-- chunk -->

### we now make 17.5 billion pounds of it and consume sixty-six pounds per person

<!-- chunk -->

### every year.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a potent form of sugar that is sweeter than regular sugar, increases

<!-- chunk -->

### appetite,


<!-- chunk -->

### promotes obesity more than regular sugar,


<!-- chunk -->

### and is more addictive than

<!-- chunk -->

### cocaine.


<!-- chunk -->

### It also leads to diabetes and an inflamed brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is now the main form of sweetener in all processed and junk foods from

<!-- chunk -->

### cola to energy snack bars, from yogurt to turkey slices, from bread to salad

<!-- chunk -->

### dressing, and even ketchup.

<!-- chunk -->

### In case an inflamed brain and an addicition stronger than cocaine doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### convince you, here are a few other reasons HFCS (and other forms of sugar) is

<!-- chunk -->

### harmful to the brain:

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar uses up your body’s store of vitamins and minerals without

<!-- chunk -->

### providing any in return.

<!-- chunk -->

### High sugar consumption is tied to so many mental disorders it’s hard to

<!-- chunk -->

### list them all. They include lower IQ, anxiety, aggressive behavior,

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactivity, depression, eating disorders, fatigue, learning difficulties,

<!-- chunk -->

### and premenstrual syndrome.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar causes crusting in your brain. Think about that sugary crust on

<!-- chunk -->

### crème brûlé or a crusty bread or crispy chicken skin. Sugar in these foods

<!-- chunk -->

### (and in your body) reacts with proteins and forms little crusts or plaques

<!-- chunk -->

### called AGEs (advanced glycation end products). These crusty sugar-

<!-- chunk -->

### protein combos gum up your brain, leading to dementia, and damage

<!-- chunk -->

### most cells and tissues along the way.

<!-- chunk -->

### So get off the sugar and save your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Trans or Hydrogenated Fats5

<!-- chunk -->

### Trans fats come from processed foods, baked goods, most fried foods,

<!-- chunk -->

### margarine, and virtually any product that comes from a factory. They damage

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, increase inflammation, and interrupt normal brain function in everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### from children with ADHD to adults with depression or dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### By eliminating these two foreign, man-made, mood-and mind-altering toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### substances from your diet, you radically transform your health overnight. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### if you put down this book right now and do nothing else, you will have made a

<!-- chunk -->

### major impact on your health.

# Protect Your Head

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain trauma, even a slight concussion, can have long-term consequences for

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain. Not only can it affect your ability to learn, focus, and concentrate,

<!-- chunk -->

### but it can increase your risk of dementia and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a gene called apo E4, found in about 25 percent of the

<!-- chunk -->

### population, you are 2.5 to 5 times more likely to get Alzheimer’s. And if you

<!-- chunk -->

### have a history of head trauma and have that gene, your risk of getting the disease

<!-- chunk -->

### increases tenfold.

<!-- chunk -->

### So protect your brain. Protect your kids’ brains. Avoid contact sports like

<!-- chunk -->

### football and heading the ball in soccer. Wear helmets for any high-risk sport such

<!-- chunk -->

### as biking, roller blading, skateboarding, snowboarding, or even skiing.

# Your Brain Loves Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### We live in a sleep-deprived world. A hundred years ago we slept eight to

<!-- chunk -->

### nine hours a night, now we average six or seven hours a night. According to a

<!-- chunk -->

### report done by the National Institute of Medicine on sleep, 50 to 70 million

<!-- chunk -->

### Americans are regularly deprived of sleep or suffer from sleep problems. This

<!-- chunk -->

### may be good for Starbucks’ bottom line, but not for your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is when your body repairs and heals. Extreme sleep deprivation leads

<!-- chunk -->

### to psychosis, as demonstrated in military recruits. Moderate-and long-term sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### deprivation leads to depression, attention deficit disorder, problems with learning

<!-- chunk -->

### and memory, not to mention 100,000 car accidents a year—especially by

<!-- chunk -->

### teenagers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lack of sleep has even been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### If that doesn’t get you to sleep more, then you should know that sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### deprivation makes you gain weight by increasing the hormone grehlin, which

<!-- chunk -->

### increases hunger, and lowering your appetite-suppressing hormones (known as

<!-- chunk -->

### PYY). You eat more to compensate for lack of sleep and you crave more sugars

<!-- chunk -->

### and refined carbohydrates as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep deprivation also increases stress hormones such as cortisol, which

<!-- chunk -->

### kills brain cells in the memory and mood center called the hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is not a nuisance or a luxury. It is part of regular maintenance and

<!-- chunk -->

### repair. Getting enough sleep can mean the difference between a tired, foggy,

<!-- chunk -->

### unfocused, forgetful brain and one that is attentive, sharp, and fully tuned into

<!-- chunk -->

### the world around you.

# Sedentary Lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are a couch potato or one of those people who, when they feel like

<!-- chunk -->

### exercising, lie down until the feeling goes away, then consider this: when you

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t exercise you have lower levels of IGF-1,


<!-- chunk -->

### an indicator of growth hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### (the repair and youth hormone) and lower levels of BDNF (brain-derived

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotropic factor), which is like super fertilizer for your brain. These chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### are the brain’s way to make new brain cells (neurogenesis) and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### connections between existing brain cells (neuroplasticity).

<!-- chunk -->

### Running, lifting, or just dancing around releases more IGF-1, which goes

<!-- chunk -->

### into your brain and stimulates more BDNF.


<!-- chunk -->

### The memory and mood center in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, the hippocampus, is the most sensitive to this fertilizer for the brain. That

<!-- chunk -->

### means when you exercise, you can improve the area of your brain that is most

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive to changes in memory and mood, and when you don’t, you won’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies (and brains) were designed to thrive with exercise, not without

<!-- chunk -->

### it. Exercise has been found to improve cognitive performance, enhance memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse depression, slow or stop mental decline associated with aging, and

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a study by the University of Illinois of third and fifth graders, the fittest

<!-- chunk -->

### kids were also the ones with the fittest brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise also builds new neural connections, rewiring your brain for better

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and cognitive function, making your brain run faster, smoother, and more

<!-- chunk -->

### efficiently.


<!-- chunk -->

### When you exercise you also increase levels of dopamine, which helps you

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, and serotonin, which calms you down. Exercise can give you the same

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter and mental benefits as Ritalin and Zyprexa without the risk or

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects. In fact, exercise beats or equals Prozac or psychotherapy as an

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant in head-to-head studies.


<!-- chunk -->

### So get moving!

# Don’t Stress Your Brain Out

<!-- chunk -->

### Why don’t zebras get ulcers? According to Dr. Robert Sapolsky from

<!-- chunk -->

### Stanford, they spend their days grazing in the savanna until a lion comes along,

<!-- chunk -->

### run like crazy until one gets caught, and then they all go back to grazing while

<!-- chunk -->

### the lion has his dinner.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relax, sudden stress, relax. That’s why they don’t get ulcers.

<!-- chunk -->

### They don’t live in a state of chronic stress. We do. We stew in our own

<!-- chunk -->

### stress juices—namely cortisol, which kills brain cells, shrinks the brain, and

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to dementia. It also causes crippling depression and other mood


<!-- chunk -->

### Any chronic psychological or emotional stress damages your brain: a

<!-- chunk -->

### divorce, a fight with your spouse, worrying about finances, or your job. Most of

<!-- chunk -->

### us don’t even know we are stressed—it’s like not realizing someone is standing

<!-- chunk -->

### on your foot until the person gets off.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that relaxing is good for your brain and can increase

<!-- chunk -->

### BDNF. People who meditate regularly actually have increased brain size and

<!-- chunk -->

### cortical thickness,


<!-- chunk -->

### along with better mood and cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### But drinking a beer, watching TV, or practicing retail therapy in the mall

<!-- chunk -->

### won’t do the trick. You have to learn tools to actively relax such as meditation,

<!-- chunk -->

### yoga, deep breathing, hypnosis, laughter therapy, biofeedback, making love,

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise, and sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### All these can reduce stress hormones and burn off excess braindamaging

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol. Practice at least one of these activities daily. I will teach you how to do

<!-- chunk -->

### that in Part III of this book.

# Toxic Drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### The four top things purchased in American supermarkets are all mood-

<!-- chunk -->

### altering drugs. They are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar—(see this chapter for effects)

<!-- chunk -->

### Caffeine—which increases anxiety and depression


<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol—large amounts (four glasses a day or more) can double your

<!-- chunk -->

### risk of dementia.

14;15

<!-- chunk -->

### Small amounts such as a few glasses a week (but

<!-- chunk -->

### not daily) may reduce the risk of dementia by 35 percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol also

<!-- chunk -->

### depletes mood-boosting B vitamins, is a brain toxin, and slows down

<!-- chunk -->

### brain metabolism.


<!-- chunk -->

### Nicotine—constricts blood flow to the brain; cigarette smoke contains

<!-- chunk -->

### four thousand toxins


<!-- chunk -->

### and leads to depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### All these drugs damage your brain. Addiction to any of them seriously

<!-- chunk -->

### damages it. The more often you partake of these mood-altering substances, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the longer you use them, the more damage you do. Occasional, moderate use is

<!-- chunk -->

### harmless. Regular use is a guarantee of premature brain aging and mood


<!-- chunk -->

## Other Drugs of Abuse

<!-- chunk -->

### Newer brain-imaging studies such as SPECT scans, which look at brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function and blood flow, clearly show the harmful effect of substance abuse.


<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Daniel Amen, who has pioneered this work, is responsible for the famous

<!-- chunk -->

### images of “your brain” and “your brain on drugs.” All substances like cocaine,

<!-- chunk -->

### methamphetamines (speed), heroin, inhalants, marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, and

<!-- chunk -->

### more have adverse effects on short-and long-term brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a SPECT scan of a normal brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 3: SPECT scan of a normal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a SPECT of a brain on methamphetamines (the same class of drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### as Ritalin).

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 4: SPECT scan of a brain on methamphetamines

<!-- chunk -->

### Any questions?

# Medications

<!-- chunk -->

### Eighty-one percent of Americans take at least one medication per week. Are

<!-- chunk -->

### you one of those people who pop an acid-blocking pill for indigestion, a

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol-lowering medication, acetaminophen for your joint pain, ibuprofen

<!-- chunk -->

### for your headaches, or a birth-control pill? Or are you getting the flu vaccine

<!-- chunk -->

### every year?

<!-- chunk -->

### We are a pill-popping society and we believe drugs are safe and have been

<!-- chunk -->

### adequately tested for long-term effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember that most drugs go on the market after being tested for a few

<!-- chunk -->

### months on only a few hundred to a few thousand people. Long-term effects don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### become apparent, except of course in the long term, after millions have been

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed.

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that drugs have many effects. The ones we like, we call “drug

<!-- chunk -->

### action.” The ones we don’t, we call “side effects.” In fact they are all “effects” of

<!-- chunk -->

### the drugs. And many of these effects damage your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have some big concerns regarding some of the most common medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### What concerns me as much as what we know now is what we don’t know.

<!-- chunk -->

### The past decade has seen a litany of products that have fallen from grace—

<!-- chunk -->

### Vioxx, Avandia, Rezulin, Seldane, Baycol, CETP inhibitors, Premarin, and

<!-- chunk -->

### more. Which drugs that millions consume today will be the fallen heroes of

<!-- chunk -->

### tomorrow?

<!-- chunk -->

### I am certainly not against medications or their intelligent use. But they

<!-- chunk -->

### should be used carefully, with full awareness of all their effects whether that’s

<!-- chunk -->

### “drug action” or “side effects.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Most medication is prescribed for conditions that are better treated by diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional therapies, and lifestyle changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are the top drugs on my radar that have potentially harmful effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain, and deplete critical nutrients that are required for optimal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function and health. For a complete list, I highly recommend the Drug-Induced

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrient Depletion Handbook. Most doctors are worried about supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### interfering with medication. This rarely occurs. But few doctors worry about

<!-- chunk -->

### severe nutrient depletion, which can lead to long-term harm from well-known

<!-- chunk -->

### “side effects” of common medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### A word of warning: Do not stop any medication prescribed by your

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor. You should talk to him or her and learn how to treat your condition

<!-- chunk -->

### with lifestyle first. If you have to use medication, learn how to use the

<!-- chunk -->

### lowest dose and compensate for the “side effects” with the right nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you can go off medication and choose to, you should do so gradually

<!-- chunk -->

### under a doctor’s supervision.

<!-- chunk -->

## CoQ10-Lowering Medication

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme Q10 is lowered by common drugs including the cholesterol-

<!-- chunk -->

### lowering statins (Lipitor, Zocor, Pravacohl), beta-blockers (Toprol, Inderal), and

<!-- chunk -->

### antidiabetic drugs (the oral hypoglycemic drugs like Glucotrol and Micronase).

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme Q10 is made by the same enzyme in your body (HMG-CoA

<!-- chunk -->

### reductase) as cholesterol. So if you take a statin, you shut down your production

<!-- chunk -->

### of coenzyme Q10, which is necessary to make energy for your cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### If you are

<!-- chunk -->

### taking these medications, seek alternatives. If you must take them, be sure to add

<!-- chunk -->

### 100 to 200 mg of coenzyme Q10 to your supplement regimen to replenish your

<!-- chunk -->

### depleted levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## B Vitamin–Lowering Medication

<!-- chunk -->

### The most worrisome class of medication for the brain in the long term, I

<!-- chunk -->

### believe, is the acid-blocking drugs.


<!-- chunk -->

### These include Prilosec, Prevacid, Nexium,

<!-- chunk -->

### Aciphex, and Protonix.

<!-- chunk -->

## Effects of Acid-Blocking Medication

<!-- chunk -->

### Prevents adequate protein digestion, which diminishes our ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide the amino-acid building blocks of neurotransmitters to help our

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, memory, and attention.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prevents mineral absorption, leading to decreased magnesium levels in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. Magnesium deficiency is a major contributor to anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases the risk of intestinal infections


<!-- chunk -->

### and causes osteoporosis.


<!-- chunk -->

### And most important, prevents absorption of B


<!-- chunk -->

### leading to fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss, dementia, and depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other drugs that deplete B vitamins include aspirin, estrogens (including

<!-- chunk -->

### birth-control pills and steroids), diuretics or water pills, anticonvulsant drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### (seizure medication, also often used for mood disorders, such as Tegretol and

<!-- chunk -->

### Depakote), anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, and drugs for Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease such as Sinemet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutathione-Lowering Medication

<!-- chunk -->

### There is one drug that stands above all others in quickly depleting

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione—acetaminophen (Tylenol or Panadol). It is found in countless over-

<!-- chunk -->

### the-counter medications. People take it all the time without thinking about it. But

<!-- chunk -->

### the truth is that this drug is more toxic than most prescription drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione is your body’s last stand against toxins, inflammation, and free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals. You will learn why these problems wreak havoc in your body in Part II,

<!-- chunk -->

### and how glutathione protects you against them.

<!-- chunk -->

### For now, suffice it to say that glutathione is one of the single most

<!-- chunk -->

### important chemicals in the human body, and a deficiency in it can cause severe

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and physical health issues.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the environmental and dietary influences that deplete

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione, half of us (and most of the people with broken brains) are missing a

<!-- chunk -->

### key gene, GSTM1, which helps the body rebuild its stores of glutathione. This

<!-- chunk -->

### only compounds the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can boost your own glutathione levels by eating foods from the

<!-- chunk -->

### broccoli and garlic families and taking a supplement called NAC (n-

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcysteine), which helps rebuild your depleted glutathione.


<!-- chunk -->

### It works to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### acetaminophen overdose in the emergency room, and prevent liver failure and

<!-- chunk -->

### death, and it will work to protect you.

<!-- chunk -->

### And remember: acetaminophen can be dangerous, especially if consumed

<!-- chunk -->

### with alcohol. Take it only occasionally and only if you really need it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Metal-Containing Medications

<!-- chunk -->

### Aside from the inadvertent contamination of many calcium supplements with

<!-- chunk -->

### lead,


<!-- chunk -->

### many medications have or have had metals put in on purpose! These

<!-- chunk -->

### metals can be literally poisonous to your body and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, aluminum has been linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer’s. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is found in antacids such as Gaviscon, Maalox, and Mylanta, which people swig

<!-- chunk -->

### like orange juice. It is also found in our water, cookware, foil wrap, and most

<!-- chunk -->

### underarm deodorants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Up until recently, mercury, in the form of thimerosal, was the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### disinfectant placed in vaccines (and is still in most flu vaccines) and contact-lens

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies “prove” that mercury exposure from vaccines is harmless.


<!-- chunk -->

### Or is it?

<!-- chunk -->

### A recent CDC study in the New England Journal of Medicine appears to

<!-- chunk -->

### have been designed to show no harm. Notably:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. They excluded all kids with autism from the study! These are the kids

<!-- chunk -->

### with the genetic susceptibilities to problems. These are the kids who can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxify. This is like doing a study to see if peanuts cause allergies, but

<!-- chunk -->

### excluding all kids with an allergy to peanuts from the study. It’s just plain

<!-- chunk -->

### bad science.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. They did not measure mercury levels in the bodies of the children—just

<!-- chunk -->

### their exposure. So if kids were good detoxifiers, of course they wouldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have effects from the mercury. They should have measured the total body

<!-- chunk -->

### load of mercury in the children studied and then noted how that

<!-- chunk -->

### correlates to any neurologic or other effects. They also should have

<!-- chunk -->

### measured the genes involved in detoxification of mercury, such as apo E4

<!-- chunk -->

### and GSTM1. Again, this is just plain bad science.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. The study itself and its accompanying editorial disclose, as potential

<!-- chunk -->

### conflicts of interest, that a number of the authors are either former

<!-- chunk -->

### employees or serve on an advisory board of, or were receiving grant

<!-- chunk -->

### support, lecture fees, or consulting fees from, the very manufacturers

<!-- chunk -->

### who put mercury in vaccines in the first place. That’s like putting tobacco

<!-- chunk -->

### companies in charge of studies on the risks of smoking.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. They didn’t explain how it could be safe that between 1991 and 1999,

<!-- chunk -->

### little babies could have inadvertently received up to 125 times the EPA

<!-- chunk -->

### safe level of mercury as determined by the oral methyl mercury standard

<!-- chunk -->

### on any given day that multiple vaccines were given. This not only

<!-- chunk -->

### exceeded the EPA standard but also the FDA, Agency for Toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### Substances and Disease Registry, and World Health Organization safety

<!-- chunk -->

### standards.

<!-- chunk -->

### This kind of unscientific “research” is the problem that keeps the medical

<!-- chunk -->

### industry (not to mention our economy) connected to practices that clearly don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### promote health and well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### If thimerosal is as safe as studies like this attempt to suggest, why was it

<!-- chunk -->

### removed from use after fifty years from most childhood and adult vaccines in

<!-- chunk -->

### 2001 (except, of course, the ones we export to the third world)? You can find out

<!-- chunk -->

### which vaccines contain mercury by going to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury isn’t safe. It’s the second-most toxic subtance known to human

<!-- chunk -->

### biology on the planet. The only chemical worse is plutonium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet mercury is everywhere in our society. Here are a few examples:

<!-- chunk -->

### A mercury-containing powder called calomel was given to babies for

<!-- chunk -->

### teething pains in the 1940s and caused pink disease (a syndrome that

<!-- chunk -->

### included cognitive and psychiatric disorders that mimicked autism).

<!-- chunk -->

### Incidentally, calomel has been used since the early days of American

<!-- chunk -->

### history as a remedy for many diseases. It is what led to President Andrew

<!-- chunk -->

### Jackson’s insanity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us used a topical disinfectant called Mercurochrome (which was

<!-- chunk -->

### silently banned by the FDA in 1998 because it was no longer considered

<!-- chunk -->

### safe due to its mercury content) for all our wounds when we were young.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury fillings or “silver” amalgams are still used in dentistry (except in

<!-- chunk -->

### most European countries, where they are banned, and in Canada, where

<!-- chunk -->

### use is highly discouraged). Though highly controversial, the American

<!-- chunk -->

### Dental Association continues to support their safety and use.

<!-- chunk -->

### If mercury in fillings is stable and does not influence human health, why do

<!-- chunk -->

### autopsy studies show the level of mercury in tissues (especially the brain)

<!-- chunk -->

### directly correlates to the number of fillings in the mouth?


<!-- chunk -->

### And why are dental

<!-- chunk -->

### fillings considered toxic waste (whose disposal the EPA regulates) when

<!-- chunk -->

### removed from your body (www.epa.gov/mercury/healthcare.htm)? Why are they

<!-- chunk -->

### banned or restricted in Canada, Germany, and Sweden? And why do studies

<!-- chunk -->

### show that the mercury migrates right through the teeth into the bloodstream?


<!-- chunk -->

### Let me reiterate this: mercury is the second-most toxic substance known to

<!-- chunk -->

### human biology after plutonium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not underestimate what ingesting this poison, from medications, dental

<!-- chunk -->

### “silver” fillings, large marine fish like tuna or shark, or even environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure can do to your body. Twenty-five percent of New Yorkers have toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### blood levels of mercury from eating too much sushi and 15 percent of American

<!-- chunk -->

### women of childbearing age have toxic levels of mercury in their blood.


<!-- chunk -->

### That

<!-- chunk -->

### means that 15 percent of the 4 million children born in the U.S.A. each year or

<!-- chunk -->

### 600,000 children are exposed to toxic levels of mercury in the womb.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is a serious health concern. Mercury will wreak havoc on your body

<!-- chunk -->

### and your brain.

# Toxic Chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### We are exposed to astounding amounts of brain pollution. More than 80,000

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals have been introduced into our society since 1900, yet only 550 have

<!-- chunk -->

### been tested for safety (www.epa.gov/iriswebp/iris/stand-al.htm). According to

<!-- chunk -->

### the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 2.5 billion pounds of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic chemicals are released yearly by large industrial facilities.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most toxicity studies (and remember there are only studies on

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals or 0.6 percent of the total amount of toxins floating around in our

<!-- chunk -->

### environment) look at only one compound at a time.


<!-- chunk -->

### But we are exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### hundreds of different toxins, most of which can affect brain function. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### few studies done on the combined effects of this toxic exposure on the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, a recent government survey (“National Report on Human Exposure

<!-- chunk -->

### to Environmental Chemicals,” issued in July 2005,

<!-- chunk -->

### www.cdc/gov/exposurereport/) found an average of 148 chemicals in our bodies,

<!-- chunk -->

### and those were only the ones they tested.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are exposed to hazardous wastes, emissions from local waste

<!-- chunk -->

### incinerators, solvents, heavy metals, ground-water pollutants including industrial

<!-- chunk -->

### heavy metal waste products such as arsenic, common materials such as

<!-- chunk -->

### phthalates (plasticizers found in all plastic bottles), and polybrominated diphenyl

<!-- chunk -->

### ethers (flame retardants).

<!-- chunk -->

### A recent study of umbilical cord blood found 287 toxic chemicals, 217 of

<!-- chunk -->

### which are toxic to the brain and nervous system. And this is what infants are

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed to even before they take their first breath.


<!-- chunk -->

### And then there are the toxins found in our foods and homes (like certain

<!-- chunk -->

### cleaning agents or pest controls), all of which add to the total toxic load on our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies.

<!-- chunk -->

### We live in a sea of toxins. See chapter 10 for more details. For now, let’s

<!-- chunk -->

### look at some of the more common toxic agents you are likely exposed to.

<!-- chunk -->

## Additives and Toxins in Our Food

<!-- chunk -->

### More than 3,500 different chemicals can be added to our food and more than

<!-- chunk -->

### 3,000 are in our homes.


<!-- chunk -->

### Every one of them is legal, and you will be exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### some or all of them, depending on how you live.

<!-- chunk -->

### The average American consumes literally pounds of hormones, antibiotics,

<!-- chunk -->

### food chemicals, additives, artificial sweeteners, and MSG each year. Each one of

<!-- chunk -->

### these toxic chemicals has been shown to harm the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The average person consumes a gallon of neurotoxic pesticides and

<!-- chunk -->

### herbicides each year by eating conventionally grown fruits and vegetables.


<!-- chunk -->

### (And that’s with people eating much less than the eight to ten servings they

<!-- chunk -->

### should be eating!) Remember, pesticides work because they are neurotoxic to

<!-- chunk -->

### pests—they attack their nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### When children are exposed to toxic chemicals and pesticides, the stakes are

<!-- chunk -->

### higher. They are exposed to a higher relative dose of these toxins due to their

<!-- chunk -->

### low body weight, and their developing brains are more sensitive to insult.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study showed children who regularly ate nonorganic foods purchased

<!-- chunk -->

### in an average grocery store had high levels of pesticides in their urine, while

<!-- chunk -->

### those who strictly ate organic food had almost none.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies link early

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticide exposure to autism


<!-- chunk -->

### and other neurobehavioral problems in children.


<!-- chunk -->

### A recent study in Lancet


<!-- chunk -->

### clearly showed that food additives make children

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactive. They took about three hundred normal children and split them into

<!-- chunk -->

### two groups. Each group was given an identical-looking colored drink. One was

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally colored and the other contained sodium benzoate and many other

<!-- chunk -->

### colors and additives.

<!-- chunk -->

### The children who drank the tainted drink were all much more hyperactive.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no benefit or role for these compounds in our diet, and much evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### of harm. They benefit the food industry by improving shelf life, taste, and

<!-- chunk -->

### “attractiveness.” But they should not be in our food supply, period. Come eat the

<!-- chunk -->

### neon blue food!

<!-- chunk -->

### These compounds (and the total load of all the other toxins we are exposed

<!-- chunk -->

### to) create changes in mood, aggressive behavior, depression, problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and focus, sleep problems, reduced intellectual performance, and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### It isn’t just consuming one red candy, blue cupcake, or the few drops of

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticide sprayed on our pint of strawberries once in a while. It is the consistent,

<!-- chunk -->

### repetitive, cumulative presence of these chemicals in our lives.

<!-- chunk -->

### The evidence of harm is in. Do we need more to act?

<!-- chunk -->

### The basis for a decision should not even be the evidence of harm (though

<!-- chunk -->

### we have more than enough); it should be the clear evidence of the absence of

<!-- chunk -->

### harm and complete safety. This is called the precautionary principle, otherwise

<!-- chunk -->

### known as better safe than sorry.

<!-- chunk -->

### But we are living human guinea pigs, and our children are the most

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why else would we be seeing epidemics of autism, mood disorders, and

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD in children over the last thirty years?

<!-- chunk -->

## Household and Environmental Toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### In our everyday life we are exposed to and absorb many toxic chemicals into

<!-- chunk -->

### our bodies, especially VOCs, or volatile organic compounds.


<!-- chunk -->

### These toxins seep

<!-- chunk -->

### out of our furniture made with formaldehyde and our sofas made with fire

<!-- chunk -->

### retardants and are in many regular household cleaning products. It is in the stuff

<!-- chunk -->

### we use to wash our dishes with, clean our tables with, wash our toilet bowls

<!-- chunk -->

### with, and clean our clothes in.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the “green” or environmental movement’s biggest assets is that it is

<!-- chunk -->

### actually cheaper to create environments and buildings that support health, rather

<!-- chunk -->

### than those that make us sick. Eliminating these toxic chemicals from our homes

<!-- chunk -->

### and workplaces is not only environmentally more sustainable, it is economically

<!-- chunk -->

### more sustainable.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, Kaiser Permanente, a large health maintenance organization in

<!-- chunk -->

### California, has gone green, declaring that all its buildings and building materials

<!-- chunk -->

### from now on will be environmentally sustainable. They project spending $24

<!-- chunk -->

### billion by 2014 on new and existing buildings to create these environmentally

<!-- chunk -->

### sustainable and health-promoting facilities. And, they say, it will be cheaper than

<!-- chunk -->

### regular construction.

<!-- chunk -->

### According to Mike Hrast, construction supervisor at the Modesto,

<!-- chunk -->

### California, Kaiser facility (still under construction at this writing), the company

<!-- chunk -->

### will save a minimum of $238,000 by implementing green standards just at this

<!-- chunk -->

### one facility.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eventually we will get to a place in our society where environmental safety

<!-- chunk -->

### and sustainability will be “built into” our homes and workplaces. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### meantime, do an inventory of all the chemicals you are exposed to at work and at

<!-- chunk -->

### home and make a clean sweep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxic chemicals have a clear impact on behavior and brain function, both

<!-- chunk -->

### short and long term.


<!-- chunk -->

### Reduce or avoid your exposure to them. I recommend a

<!-- chunk -->

### book called Green Housekeeping by Ellen Sandbeck as a resource to cleaning up

<!-- chunk -->

### your home environment.

# Toxic Molds

<!-- chunk -->

### Mold exposure is also a threat to our brains. I have seen many patients whose

<!-- chunk -->

### brains malfunction from mold toxins (known as mycotoxins), common in homes

<!-- chunk -->

### and office buildings. Remember, that was part of Clayton’s story in chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### (page 28). His home was infected with toxic mold.

<!-- chunk -->

### The suffering and symptoms caused by these molds are well described as

<!-- chunk -->

### “sick building syndrome.”


<!-- chunk -->

### These mold toxins cause nerve damage and provoke

<!-- chunk -->

### the body to produce autoimmunity or autoantibodies against its own nerves and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a study in the Archives of Environmental Health,


<!-- chunk -->

### scientists studied one

<!-- chunk -->

### hundred patients who had been exposed to toxic molds in their homes. The most

<!-- chunk -->

### common molds were Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium,

<!-- chunk -->

### Stachybotrys (also known as the toxic black mold), Curvularia, Basidiomycetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### Myxomycetes, Epicoccus, Fusarium, Bipolaris, and Rhizopus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sounds like an invasion!

<!-- chunk -->

### These scientists found that more than 80 percent of the people living with

<!-- chunk -->

### these molds had immune system abnormalities, and 64 percent had respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### system problems like sinus problems and wheezing.

<!-- chunk -->

### More alarming was that 70 percent had severe symptoms of brain damage,

<!-- chunk -->

### including an inability to walk in a straight line with their eyes closed, difficulty

<!-- chunk -->

### standing on their toes, and short-term memory loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### More alarming still was the finding, in 100 percent of patients, of

<!-- chunk -->

### autonomic nervous system abnormalities (this is the automatic nervous system

<!-- chunk -->

### that controls all your basic life functions like heart rate and breathing).

<!-- chunk -->

### If that weren’t enough, brain scans were abnormal in 86 percent of those

<!-- chunk -->

### studied and objective neuropsychological testing of brain function was abnormal

<!-- chunk -->

### in 100 percent of them. This included findings of short-term memory loss and

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment of executive function/judgment, concentration, and hand-eye

<!-- chunk -->

### coordination.


<!-- chunk -->

### So if you think you may be exposed to mold, be extremely aggressive in

<!-- chunk -->

### addressing it.

# Toxic Metals

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, we live not only in a sea of toxic chemicals but also of toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### metals, including mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and aluminum.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two of the most braindamaging compounds known are both heavy metals

<!-- chunk -->

### —mercury and lead. The research on these is abundant and frightening. Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### David Bellinger, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, reviewed

<!-- chunk -->

### this research in his paper “Children’s Cognitive Health: The Influence of

<!-- chunk -->

### Environmental Chemical Exposures.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Lead was the first toxic heavy metal to be identified, and some action has

<!-- chunk -->

### been taken regarding lead exposure in our society. Before lead paint and leaded

<!-- chunk -->

### gasoline were banned, exposure levels were much higher. However, they are still

<!-- chunk -->

### a major problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxic metals, like lead and mercury, are highly persistent in the

<!-- chunk -->

### environment and can be carried far distances in the atmosphere, getting

<!-- chunk -->

### deposited far from their place of origin.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, coal-burning, lead-and mercury-belching smokestacks in

<!-- chunk -->

### China send their toxic load to the most remote and wild areas of America. Lead

<!-- chunk -->

### and mercury from facilities like these also end up on our driveways and streets

<!-- chunk -->

### and on our carpets and floors where children play. (That’s not to mention all the

<!-- chunk -->

### lead-painted toys from China.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Herbert Needleman examined the effects of lead on 2,146 children in

<!-- chunk -->

### first and second grade in Alabama.


<!-- chunk -->

### He looked at lead levels in teeth, not in

<!-- chunk -->

### blood, to assess long-term exposure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not only did the children with the highest levels of lead have the lowest

<!-- chunk -->

### IQs, but they were also more distractible, dependent, disorganized, hyperactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### and impulsive, and had difficulty following simple directions. There were no

<!-- chunk -->

### children in the high-lead group that had IQs over 125, while 5 percent in the

<!-- chunk -->

### low-lead group did.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Needleman did a follow-up study


<!-- chunk -->

### on these children that found the

<!-- chunk -->

### lead-exposed children experienced serious consequences when they got older.

<!-- chunk -->

### They faced a higher rate of high school dropout, a greater likelihood of reading

<!-- chunk -->

### disability, lower class standing in high school, increased absenteeism, lower

<!-- chunk -->

### vocabulary and grammatical-reasoning scores, poorer hand-eye coordination,

<!-- chunk -->

### longer reaction times, and slower finger tapping.

<!-- chunk -->

### They were also more likely to have episodes of juvenile delinquency.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the 1950s the American government set safe levels of lead at

<!-- chunk -->

### micrograms per deciliter of blood as the upper limit of “normal.” Considering

<!-- chunk -->

### severe brain damage occurs at 100 micrograms per deciliter, and death at

<!-- chunk -->

### micrograms per deciliter, this decision is perplexing.

<!-- chunk -->

### The “safe” level was decreased to 40 in 1971, 30 in 1975, 25 in 1985, and

<!-- chunk -->

### 10 in 1991.

<!-- chunk -->

### But recent studies show that the greatest drop-off in IQ scores happens

<!-- chunk -->

### between a level of 1 and 10 micrograms per deciliter.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is particularly scary

<!-- chunk -->

### since more than 10 percent of poor and inner-city children have lead exposure

<!-- chunk -->

### levels over 10 micrograms per deciliter!

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, children aren’t the only population at risk. Lead exposure in

<!-- chunk -->

### adults has been linked to severe depression and schizophrenia. One factory that

<!-- chunk -->

### produced tetraethyl lead was known as the “House of Butterflies,” because so

<!-- chunk -->

### many workers had hallucinations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lead exposure has also been linked to depression, irritability, interpersonal

<!-- chunk -->

### conflict, fatigue, anger, tension, and even decreased sex drive.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it has been linked to degenerative changes in the brain on MRI. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence shows that much of what we think of as “normal” age-related decline

<!-- chunk -->

### in mental and cognitive function is actually due to chronic lead toxicity and the

<!-- chunk -->

### resultant loss of brain function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Understand that since lead was removed from gasoline, and house paint,

<!-- chunk -->

### blood levels of the average person have dropped tenfold in the last few decades.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, lead is still dramatically higher in people today than it was in

<!-- chunk -->

### those who lived before the industrial age. We continue to be exposed to it in our

<!-- chunk -->

### soil and water, as well as from our own bones, where it is stored.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it is lethal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blood lead levels were measured in a nationally representative sample of

<!-- chunk -->

### 13,946 adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

### Examination Survey (NHANES III), recruited in 1988 to 1994 and followed for

<!-- chunk -->

### up to twelve years to track what diseases people developed and why they died.


<!-- chunk -->

### The NHANES III study found that any level over 2 micrograms per

<!-- chunk -->

### deciliter (not 10 or 40) in the blood caused dramatic increases in heart attacks,

<!-- chunk -->

### strokes, and death.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, after controlling for all other risk factors including cholesterol, high

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure, smoking, and inflammation, the study found that the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### death from all causes increased by 25 percent, deaths from heart disease

<!-- chunk -->

### increased by 55 percent, risk of heart attacks increased by 151 percent, and risk

<!-- chunk -->

### of stroke increased by 89 percent.

<!-- chunk -->

### What was even more remarkable is that it is estimated that nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of all Americans have toxic levels of lead high enough to cause these

<!-- chunk -->

### problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that using chelation therapy (an underused medical

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment to help the body bind and excrete metals) has been effective in

<!-- chunk -->

### reversing many of these problems.


<!-- chunk -->

### So we know lead is an extremely toxic substance. What about mercury?

<!-- chunk -->

### Well, I’ve already told you it’s the second most toxic substance after

<!-- chunk -->

### plutonium. But in case that isn’t enough...

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury, I believe (because of the hundreds of patients I have seen with

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury toxicity), is one of the most serious threats to our brain, and is

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for or contributes to much of the modern epidemic of autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD, depression, dementia, and other versions of broken brains. Finding it

<!-- chunk -->

### and getting rid of it in my patients is one of the most effective ways I have to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mood, attention, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury is emitted from coal-burning industrial facilities at the rate of

<!-- chunk -->

### 2,900 tons (or over 6 million pounds) per year. As you consider that, keep in

<!-- chunk -->

### mind mercury is toxic at greater than 1 part per million, and that the EPA has

<!-- chunk -->

### declared the “safe” level of mercury exposure to be less than 0.1

<!-- chunk -->

### micrograms/kilogram body weight/day.

<!-- chunk -->

### That means we are in big trouble based on our exposure.

<!-- chunk -->

### After testing mercury levels in thousands of patients, I believe that a large

<!-- chunk -->

### majority of us have some level of mercury toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury has been implicated in severe neurologic injury. This was well

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated in the Minamata Bay exposures (from toxic dumping into the

<!-- chunk -->

### ocean) and the Iraq grain contamination disaster (mercury was applied to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### spoilage of grain used for planting, but the grain was eaten by accident).

<!-- chunk -->

### But mercury is also toxic at very low doses. We have already looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury in dental amalgams and vaccines, but environmental exposures are also

<!-- chunk -->

### significant risks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The largest is from consumption of large fish contaminated with mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### such as tuna, swordfish, shark, tilefish, and sea bass, as well as nearly all river

<!-- chunk -->

### fish.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember you are whatever you ate. Big fish eat smaller fish and so on.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxins bioconcentrate up the food chain. The bigger the fish, the higher dose of

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury you are likely to get. So eat only fish that are small enough to fit in your

<!-- chunk -->

### frying pan. Sardines are my favorite.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies of fish-consuming populations directly correlate levels of mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### in the umbilical cord blood with lower IQ, attention deficits, and impairment in

<!-- chunk -->

### language and memory. So if you don’t think the amount of mercury you are

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed to in the fish you eat is a problem, think again.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s most frightening are autopsy studies on mercury-exposed people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Adult brains show damage in only a few areas—the ones responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia and depression. But if exposure to mercury occurred in the womb or

<!-- chunk -->

### early in life, it was deposited in the entire brain and completely disrupted normal

<!-- chunk -->

### brain development.


<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly exposure to toxic metals is damaging to the brain. We need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### very smart about reducing emissions and exposures, as well as treating heavy

<!-- chunk -->

### metal toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### We will review the role of all toxins in our health in more detail in Part II,

<!-- chunk -->

### where I explain how problems with detoxification and toxic exposures are linked

<!-- chunk -->

### to most of the worst neurological disorders (like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s),

<!-- chunk -->

### mood or psychological disorders (including depression anxiety, insomnia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### more), as well as autism and ADHD.

# Toxic Waves

<!-- chunk -->

### Even though most of us are not willing (or able) to give up our computers,

<!-- chunk -->

### cell phones, wireless networks, microwave ovens, televisions, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### electronics, we have to ask if these electromagnetic devices are harming us.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if you could give them up, you would have to think about the effects all the

<!-- chunk -->

### radiofrequency waves buzzing about from WiFi, cell towers, power lines, and

<!-- chunk -->

### electrical wires have on you.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are electromagnetic beings. Just think about an EKG or EEG—these

<!-- chunk -->

### simply record the electrical activities of your heart and brain. We are very

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive to electromagnetic fields of any kind, and excessive exposure to certain

<!-- chunk -->

### types of toxic waves may be extremely harmful to our health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before I briefly review the risks of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on

<!-- chunk -->

### human health, I want to state that the absence of evidence is not evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### absence. This is an area of enormous controversy and equally large knowledge

<!-- chunk -->

### gaps. But to think that because we haven’t adequately studied the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### “electropollution” it is not a problem may be a grave error. The data we do have

<!-- chunk -->

### is enough to make me very concerned.


<!-- chunk -->

### The few things we do know make me want to limit my exposure. This is an

<!-- chunk -->

### area where caution should be our guide.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, we know that EMFs alter cellular metabolism and generate

<!-- chunk -->

### free radicals that can be toxic to your brain and promote memory loss and

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia. Research shows higher rates of Alzheimer’s in people exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### EMFs.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies link it to mood disorders and depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### EMFs also may be linked to an increase in cancers, especially brain cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Could having a radiofrequency-emitting device (otherwise known as a cell

<!-- chunk -->

### phone) held up to your brain for hours a day have an impact? Do you want to

<!-- chunk -->

### wait twenty years to find out?

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that cell phone use does account for thousands of deaths every

<!-- chunk -->

### year from car accidents (because people don’t pay attention to driving when they

<!-- chunk -->

### are on the phone).

<!-- chunk -->

### There are 1.6 billion cell-phone users worldwide, with the number growing

<!-- chunk -->

### every day. And over half of the children in developing countries use them. What

<!-- chunk -->

### impact does this have on a developing brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### While I do use a cell phone, I try to limit its use and use a safe headset such

<!-- chunk -->

### as one that has an air tube to diffuse the EMF (not a wireless one).

<!-- chunk -->

### Cell phones are only the most obvious form of EMFs we are exposed to. As

<!-- chunk -->

### I mentioned at the start of this section, we are also exposed to toxic waves in

<!-- chunk -->

### many other forms. There are things you can do to reduce your exposure to these

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic waves and protect yourself, and you may not even have to give up all your

<!-- chunk -->

### electronics to do it. I will review how you can protect yourself and your family

<!-- chunk -->

### in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

### What you learned in this chapter is depressing, I know. But I don’t believe

<!-- chunk -->

### in the proverb “What you don’t know won’t hurt you,” at least when it comes to

<!-- chunk -->

### brain damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly there are many environmental influences that can have a major

<!-- chunk -->

### impact on your brain health. These toxins affect us all from our food, our water,

<!-- chunk -->

### and our air, medications, chemicals, metals, molds, and electromagnetic

<!-- chunk -->

### radiation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyday choices we make to protect ourselves will have an impact

<!-- chunk -->

### globally. The European Union, through new legislation (called REACH)

<!-- chunk -->

### designed to limit toxins in commercially produced goods, caused China to

<!-- chunk -->

### change its manufacturing practices. The European Union also demanded that

<!-- chunk -->

### Silicon Valley produce cells phones without toxic metals and they did.

<!-- chunk -->

### Buying organic food, refusing vaccines with mercury, and buying deodorant

<!-- chunk -->

### without aluminum will create a ripple effect throughout our economy and

<!-- chunk -->

### environment.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can make changes in your life and in your world with the choices you

<!-- chunk -->

### make.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s more, you can make changes in your personal health. You can heal

<!-- chunk -->

### yourself from brain damage by improving your diet, limiting your exposure to

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, and changing the way you live. You can reverse the effects of depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, bipolar disorder, autism, Alzheimer’s, ADHD, and more—if you know

<!-- chunk -->

### how to.

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution is designed to give you a specific method to

<!-- chunk -->

### achieve that goal and by doing so take one more step toward that state of vital

<!-- chunk -->

### health I call UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### You now understand the theoretical underpinnings of this approach. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### time to learn how to apply it in practice to fix your broken brain. Whether you

<!-- chunk -->

### are suffering from depression, lack of attention, autism, Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, or if you just deal with bad moods and brain fog, the UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution will help you overcome these problems so you can achieve

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness.

# PART II

# The Seven Keys to UltraWellness


# YOUR MOOD AND BRAIN POWER ARE

# NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD

<!-- chunk -->

## The Seven Keys to UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part II, I will explain how seven key biological systems influence every

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling, thought, emotion, behavior, and memory we have (not to mention our

<!-- chunk -->

### physical health and weight). It is through understanding how these systems play

<!-- chunk -->

### a role in your health and your brain (the same thing) that you can take control of

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain health and recover from the debilitating effects of memory disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention deficits, and mood disturbances. If you focus on your health first, your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain may take care of itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### These factors must be addressed first because medication and

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapy are then rarely needed, and if used, will be dramatically more

<!-- chunk -->

### effective. These seven keys are the new way to repair, renew, and revitalize your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and help return your life to balance and vibrant health.

<!-- chunk -->

### I introduced you to the seven keys to UltraWellness, which form the basis

<!-- chunk -->

### of The UltraMind Solution in Part I. To refresh your memory, they are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Optimize Nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Balance Your Hormones

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Cool Off Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Fix Your Digestion

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Enhance Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Boost Energy Metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. Calm Your Mind

<!-- chunk -->

### In the following seven chapters I will show you how each of these seven

<!-- chunk -->

### keys fits into the larger story of mental and physical health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each chapter contains quizzes to help you identify where you are out of

<!-- chunk -->

### balance. Are you deficient in omega-3 fats? Are you magnesium-deficient? Are

<!-- chunk -->

### you mercury toxic? Is your thyroid not functioning well? Is gluten inflaming

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain? Is sugar destroying your mood and brain? The quizzes will help you

<!-- chunk -->

### answer these questions.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III, I give you my six-week plan on how to care for your brain for

<!-- chunk -->

### life. I will explain the basic “ingredients” you need to make a happy, attentive,

<!-- chunk -->

### sharp, clear, and engaged brain. This is the basic care plan for your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part IV, I will show you how to customize the basic care plan for your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain based on your quizzes. Those quizzes give you the information you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand which of your systems are out of balance. You will learn how to

<!-- chunk -->

### bring each of your core systems back into a thriving and robust balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you need more omega-3 fats, or vitamin B

12,

<!-- chunk -->

### or thyroid hormone? Do

<!-- chunk -->

### you need to cool off an inflamed brain, or detoxify a toxic brain? I will help you

<!-- chunk -->

### find answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### But regardless of the name of your disease, a mood disorder, a problem

<!-- chunk -->

### with attention or memory, a neurological disease, or even psychosis, what you

<!-- chunk -->

### learn in The UltraMind Solution will help you live the best, healthiest life you

<!-- chunk -->

### can.

# Have Another (Drug) Cocktail?

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to tell you a story about the typical patient I see with a whole list of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems—all apparently unrelated and all treated by different doctors. While

<!-- chunk -->

### this man’s symptoms were partly controlled, he was anything but healthy. He

<!-- chunk -->

### was on a cocktail of four psychoactive drugs just to manage his life at forty-two

<!-- chunk -->

### years old!

<!-- chunk -->

### Do people really need psychological “cocktails” of drugs just to help them

<!-- chunk -->

### deal with depression, anxiety, insomnia, and ADHD? Joe’s story points to an

<!-- chunk -->

### answer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Joe was a forty-two-year-old man who thought he was healthy—despite

<!-- chunk -->

### being on four different drugs for mood and psychiatric problems. This list of

<!-- chunk -->

### medications was a bit scary for a guy in his early forties. He took one for

<!-- chunk -->

### depression (Lexapro), one for attention deficit disorder because he couldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrate (Concerta), one for anxiety (Xanax), and one for sleep (Ambien).

<!-- chunk -->

### One new drug was piled on another over just a few years!

<!-- chunk -->

### He also took medications for asthma and frequent rounds of antibiotics over

<!-- chunk -->

### the years. He had psoriasis, reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### postnasal drip. His sex drive was low, and his anal area was always itchy. He

<!-- chunk -->

### got frequent sores and bumps on his tongue after eating certain foods. He also

<!-- chunk -->

### had sugar cravings and would frequently get weak and have episodes of very low

<!-- chunk -->

### blood sugar (hypoglycemia). He was about twenty-five pounds overweight—

<!-- chunk -->

### right around his middle—and his triglycerides were over five hundred (normal is

<!-- chunk -->

### less than one hundred). He had a fatty liver and prediabetes or metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### Joe’s diet was less than ideal. He ate a bagel or a processed protein bar in

<!-- chunk -->

### the morning with coffee. Lunch was usually a turkey wrap with lots of cheese, a

<!-- chunk -->

### few diet Cokes, and chips. Dinner was a little better, but he craved bread, pasta,

<!-- chunk -->

### and potatoes and had sweets after dinner because he craved them. He usually

<!-- chunk -->

### had two glasses of wine a day, three cups of coffee, and too many diet Cokes to

<!-- chunk -->

### count. He slept about five to six hours a night.

<!-- chunk -->

### Looking at the seven keys to UltraWellness, we found many imbalances. His

<!-- chunk -->

### gut was inflamed, and he had a parasite and yeast overgrowth from years of

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotic use. This led to food sensitivities to wheat and rye (the main gluten-

<!-- chunk -->

### containing grains). He had multiple nutritional deficiencies, including B


<!-- chunk -->

### folate, vitamin D, chromium, and omega-3 fats—all very important for mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### a healthy metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### So instead of treating any one disease or problem, I helped him by treating

<!-- chunk -->

### the imbalances in his life.

<!-- chunk -->

### I helped him improve his diet, stop the refined carbohydrates and sugars,

<!-- chunk -->

### and eat more fiber and omega-3 fats. I also had him get off gluten and dairy—

<!-- chunk -->

### foods that were triggering inflammation in his gut. He cut way back on coffee

<!-- chunk -->

### and stopped drinking wine. And he started exercising and sleeping a bit more.

<!-- chunk -->

### I gave him a multivitamin (with plenty of chromium), fish oil, and probiotics

<!-- chunk -->

### (healthy gut bacteria). I also treated him with high doses of folate and B


<!-- chunk -->

### to

<!-- chunk -->

### accommodate his genetic need for more. In addition to this, I gave him high

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of vitamin D to bring his levels back to normal and improve his mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system. I treated his parasite and the yeast overgrowth with short-term

<!-- chunk -->

### medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### After three months, I saw him again. This time he had lost twenty-five

<!-- chunk -->

### pounds, his triglycerides dropped from 597 to 80, and his cholesterol went from

<!-- chunk -->

### 275 to 198. His folate and B


<!-- chunk -->

### status was back to normal. His fasting blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### dropped from 101 to 84, which is normal, and his insulin levels dropped back to

<!-- chunk -->

### normal. His fatty liver was healed. And how did he feel?

<!-- chunk -->

### Well, he had no more need for reflux medication or inhalers for asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those symptoms were gone. Without my instruction (and despite my advice to the

<!-- chunk -->

### contrary), he stopped all four of his psychiatric medications because he was

<!-- chunk -->

### sleeping fine, was no longer anxious or depressed, and had no more problems

<!-- chunk -->

### with concentration or attention.

<!-- chunk -->

## The science of Functional Medicine is ready for the doctor’s office. It is

<!-- chunk -->

## possible for people to get to the root of their problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Asthma and reflux are not irreversible problems, but may be the result of

<!-- chunk -->

### food sensitivities to substances like gluten or dairy, or imbalances in the gut from

<!-- chunk -->

### parasites and yeast, or the product of a poor diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Similarly, depression (and other psychological issues like the ones Joe

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered) may be related to key nutritional factors, including sugar in the diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### and nutritional deficiencies such as folic acid, vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , vitamin D, and

<!-- chunk -->

### omega-3 fats, as well as food sensitivities or gut problems—not a Lexapro

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### With Joe, I once again found myself an accidental psychiatrist, witnessing

<!-- chunk -->

### remarkable transformations in patients by simply taking away the things that

<!-- chunk -->

### make them ill and giving them things that put them back in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is really that simple. The body’s intelligence for healing does the rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the essence of the UltraMind Solution.


# KEY #1: OPTIMIZE NUTRITION

<!-- chunk -->

## The Key to Mental Health and Brain Health

<!-- chunk -->

### —————

<!-- chunk -->

### The staple foods may not contain the same nutritive substances as in former

<!-- chunk -->

### times... Chemical fertilizers, by increasing the abundance of the crops without

<!-- chunk -->

### replacing all the exhausted elements of the soil, have indirectly contributed to

<!-- chunk -->

### change the nutritive value of cereal grains and of vegetables... They have, thus,

<!-- chunk -->

### contributed to the weakening of our body and our soul.

<!-- chunk -->

ALEXIS CARREL

<!-- chunk -->

### , Man the Unknown

<!-- chunk -->

### Optimal nutrition is the most important factor in keeping your brain healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Feeding your brain is not something most of us know how to do. What you put

<!-- chunk -->

### in your mouth provides all the raw materials to build the structure of your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells and keep all the communications systems running coherently so you can

<!-- chunk -->

### think, emote, learn, and remember. You have to start with the right food, and

<!-- chunk -->

### enough of the right nutrients for the brain to function well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is that most of us (including doctors) know very little about

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition and even less about how and why vitamins and minerals are so

<!-- chunk -->

### essential for brain function and health. To restore optimal brain function and

<!-- chunk -->

### health, you need to know the why, not just the what, of what you are doing.

<!-- chunk -->

### I know that the nutritional science I present in this chapter may feel a little

<!-- chunk -->

### dense, but you can understand it. Once you do, it will completely alter your

<!-- chunk -->

### perception of the role of food and nutrients in your physical and mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### forever.

<!-- chunk -->

### This background knowledge will help you take full advantage of The

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution. If you know what is happening in the body, why it goes

<!-- chunk -->

### wrong, and how to fix it, you are much more likely to incorporate changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### your diet, behavior, and habits in the long run. And it just may motivate you to

<!-- chunk -->

### take your vitamins and essential omega-3 fats every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### This chapter will focus on the most important aspects of nutrition in the

<!-- chunk -->

### context of your brain function.

# Bad Brain Food Versus Good Brain Food

<!-- chunk -->

### In chapter 4, I explained the harmful effects of trans fats, high-fructose corn

<!-- chunk -->

### syrup and sugar, artificial sweeteners and food additives, as well as the dangers

<!-- chunk -->

### of hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, and heavy metals, in our food. I also

<!-- chunk -->

### reviewed the risks of caffeine and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Common sense and scientific research both lead us to the conclusion that if

<!-- chunk -->

### we want healthy bodies and healthy brains we must put in the right raw

<!-- chunk -->

### materials: real, whole, local, fresh, unadulterated, unprocessed, and chemical-,

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone-, and antibiotic-free food.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no role for foreign molecules that interfere with our biology at

<!-- chunk -->

### every level. Enough said.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at what we should be eating—the stuff of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the remainder of this chapter I am going to focus on the ingredients most

<!-- chunk -->

### relevant to the epidemic of broken brains, of mood, behavior, attention, and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory disorders. We will focus on the role of the following in brain health:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. The essential fats

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. The key essential amino acids, which come from protein

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Carbohydrates

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Vitamins and minerals

<!-- chunk -->

### Special brain vitamins, including folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### Special minerals, including magnesium, zinc, and selenium.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part IV, we will review many other special nutrients essential for healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### brain function that work specifically in different key systems, such as acetyl-L-

<!-- chunk -->

### carnitine, n-acetylcysteine, or coenzyme Q10. These become more essential

<!-- chunk -->

### under certain conditions of life, such as stress or toxicity or age.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start with fats.

# Scoring Key—Fatty Acids


<!-- chunk -->

### Do you gather wild plants to eat or hunt for your meat? If not, you are

<!-- chunk -->

### likely one of the 99 percent of people in the twenty-first century who are

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient in the most important ingredient in our bodies for normal cell and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function—omega-3 fatty acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Greenland Inuit (a native tribe in Greenland) consumed between

<!-- chunk -->

### and 19 gm of omega-3 fats a day from eating whale, walrus, seal, and arctic char.

<!-- chunk -->

### That may be how much we are designed to operate on. Most of us consume far

<!-- chunk -->

### less than 1 gm a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 fats come from wild things—which means they are hard to find in

<!-- chunk -->

### today’s society. In the modern world our only real source of omega-3 fats is fish,

<!-- chunk -->

### and most of the fish we eat are contaminated with toxins and mercury, which

<!-- chunk -->

### may lead to a host of problems you will learn more about in chapter 10.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aside from controlling your gene function, regulating your immune system,

<!-- chunk -->

### and improving your metabolism, these fats are vital components of the cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membrane that covers every one of the 100 trillion cells in your body. Without

<!-- chunk -->

### omega-3 fats, the proper messages can’t be communicated from one cell to

<!-- chunk -->

### another.

<!-- chunk -->

### The two most important omega-3 fats to know about are eicosapentanoic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). They are both necessary omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### fats. Since your brain is mostly fat, and 60 percent of your brain is specifically

<!-- chunk -->

### made of DHA, it is easy to see why they are so important. If you don’t have

<!-- chunk -->

### enough, the brain doesn’t work.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, in the last 150 years we have seen an unprecedented change in

<!-- chunk -->

### our fat intake. Refined, omega-6, inflammatory oils, including corn, soy, and

<!-- chunk -->

### safflower oils, replaced omega-3 fats from fish, wild game, and wild plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats has increased from 1:1 to 10:1 or 20:1

<!-- chunk -->

### in our diets, and the effects have been disastrous. All of the major diseases of

<!-- chunk -->

### aging as well as the epidemic of “brain disorders” are directly associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### this change in our diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Today the only real sources of omega-3 fats are breast milk, wild fish and

<!-- chunk -->

### game, seaweed, algae, and eggs hatched from chickens fed only on flaxseeds and

<!-- chunk -->

### fish meal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our brains don’t work without omega-3 fats. Period. That is why low levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of omega-3 fats have been linked to everything from depression and anxiety, to

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disease and criminal behavior, to schizophrenia, to attention deficit

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder and autism and learning disabilities, as well as dementia and many other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological diseases.


<!-- chunk -->

### The omega-3 fatty acids from wild fish and certain nuts and seeds like

<!-- chunk -->

### flaxseeds play critical roles in our cognitive development and learning, visual

<!-- chunk -->

### development, immune and inflammatory function, fetal brain development, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### health, Alzheimer’s disease, and mental illness, not to mention heart disease and

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### At a recent nutrition conference I listened to Joseph Hibbeln, M.D. (who is

<!-- chunk -->

### the scientist in the section dedicated to nutritional neurosciences at the National

<!-- chunk -->

### Institutes of Health), where he presented some startling data about the effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### fish oil or omega-3 fats on our mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### He told us that the flood of soy oils and seed oils like corn in our diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### which contain high amounts of linoleic acid (an unhealthy omega-6 fatty acid),

<!-- chunk -->

### promote inflammation and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### In our culture, this inflammatory fatty acid primarily comes from soy oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eighty percent of the fats consumed in the United States are linoleic acid, which

<!-- chunk -->

### comes from soy oil and other similar fats. Twenty percent are in the form of

<!-- chunk -->

### EPA, which comes from fish oil. (I believe we consume even less EPA.)

<!-- chunk -->

### In Japan,80 percent of the fat eaten is EPA, and only 20 percent is

<!-- chunk -->

### arachidonic acid (another unhealthy omega-6 fatty acid). That may be why the

<!-- chunk -->

### Japanese have less depression, dementia, and heart disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consuming these harmful seed and soy oils instead of omega-3 fats changes

<!-- chunk -->

### our tissue composition in dramatic ways and damages our health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Hibbeln explained that there has been a thousandfold increase in the

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption of soy oil over the last century. In fact, 20 percent of all calories

<!-- chunk -->

### consumed in America are from soybean oil and therefore 9 to 10 percent of all

<!-- chunk -->

### our calories are from linoleic acid instead of the omega-3 fats, which we should

<!-- chunk -->

### be eating.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is interesting that 4 to 5 million years of human evolution occurred in a

<!-- chunk -->

### seafood-rich nutritional environment in which seafood was the main source of

<!-- chunk -->

### fats. There were no seed oils, which we now use to cook French fries,

<!-- chunk -->

### doughnuts, and packaged foods. We have to ask ourselves what happens to our

<!-- chunk -->

### mind and body when our nutritional environment radically changes this way.

<!-- chunk -->

### This level of the soy oils in our diet is unsafe. Recent research has found

<!-- chunk -->

### that homicide mortality in the United Kingdom increased dramatically with the

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in consumption of linoleic acid from soy oil.


<!-- chunk -->

### The same thing happened

<!-- chunk -->

### in the United States as well as in Australia, Canada, and Argentina. Conversely,

<!-- chunk -->

### the homicide mortality rates are inversely related to seafood consumption,

<!-- chunk -->

### meaning that the more seafood people eat in a society such as Japan, the less

<!-- chunk -->

### homicide they have.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even more dramatic was a study published in the British Journal of

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatry in 2002 that looked at the reduction in felony-level violent offenses

<!-- chunk -->

### among prisoners with supplementation of omega-3 fats.


<!-- chunk -->

### A placebo-controlled

<!-- chunk -->

### trial gave one group the recommended daily amounts of vitamins, minerals, and

<!-- chunk -->

### omega-3 fats and the other group retained their regular prison diet and lifestyle.

<!-- chunk -->

### By just providing vitamin and fish-oil supplements, there was a 35 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in felony-related violent crime in prison.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has also been shown that a lack of fish consumption is universally related

<!-- chunk -->

### to depression. A one-year study found EPA was helpful in treating resistant

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 fats are also helpful in treating postpartum depression. DHA from

<!-- chunk -->

### fish oils is a critical part of a mother’s breast milk that helps neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### development in the fetus. Women who have higher levels of omega-3 fats in

<!-- chunk -->

### their tissues have lower rates of postpartum depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Similarly, kids who have dyslexia, dyspraxia (difficulty writing), other

<!-- chunk -->

### learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder are mostly omega-3 fat–

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient. Dopamine activity, which is critical for brain function in these

<!-- chunk -->

### children, is improved with essential fatty acid consumption. There have been

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled studies showing that giving fish oil to children with these kinds of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems improves reading and spelling in treatment groups and improves

<!-- chunk -->

### conduct in school because the nervous system is very dependent on these fats to


<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 fats are well known for their benefits in heart health, obesity, and

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes. They help prevent heart attacks, arrhythmias, and strokes; reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation; and prevent blood clots. But their effects on the brain are just as

<!-- chunk -->

### critical.

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 fats may sound like a miracle cure, and they can be in some cases.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have seen patients completely recover from autism with cod liver oil (which

<!-- chunk -->

### contains omega-3 fats, and vitamins A and D).


<!-- chunk -->

### One of my patients, a twenty-year-old woman who hated seafood and

<!-- chunk -->

### avoided it her whole life, suffered from depression, learning disabilities, obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle pain, and chronic fatigue. Her blood tests showed severe omega-3 fat

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency and an overload of inflammatory omega-6 fats. By giving her an oil

<!-- chunk -->

### change with high doses of fish oil (EPA and DHA), she recovered from her

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and cognitive struggles, her pain disappeared, and she lost sixty

<!-- chunk -->

### pounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### But why the dramatic change with one simple supplement?

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t make the mistake to think all the conditions listed above (or those

<!-- chunk -->

### discussed elsewhere in the book) can magically be cured with a little fish oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some may, but most conditions result from imbalance and deficiencies in many

<!-- chunk -->

### of the body’s core systems. Nutrient deficiency is only one area where problems

<!-- chunk -->

### are created, and omega-3 fats are only one of those nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are omega-3 fat–deficient, B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficient, have mercury poisoning,

<!-- chunk -->

### low thyroid function, and eat foods you are allergic to, just fixing the omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### fat deficiencies won’t cure the whole problem. You have to fix everything.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, nutrient deficiency is a major contributor to all of the other health

<!-- chunk -->

### issues you may be experiencing, so figuring out what nutrients you are deficient

<!-- chunk -->

### in and reestablishing nutritional balance is an important step on your path to

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am going to use the example of omega-3 fats to show you the myriad

<!-- chunk -->

### ways in which nutrients work in the body to normalize function and why their

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency can cause so many diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Omega-3 Fats (and Other Fats)

<!-- chunk -->

## Do, and Why Deficiencies Wreak Havoc on Your Biology

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are four key roles omega-3 fats play in your body and reasons why they

<!-- chunk -->

### are linked to so many different mood, memory, and attention problems (as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as most chronic diseases).


<!-- chunk -->

### These fats are literally the stuff we are made of.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. They build all cell membranes (along with a few other key fats called

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipids—PC and PS).

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. They reduce inflammation, which has been linked to almost all brain

<!-- chunk -->

### problems such as autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. They balance blood sugar, which, as you will see in chapter 7, is essential

<!-- chunk -->

### for keeping your brain healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. They increase the activity of a key molecule in your brain called BDNF

<!-- chunk -->

### (brain-derived neurotropic factor), which acts like fertilizer for your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, stimulating new cell growth and increased cell connections.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a closer look at our cell membranes, which form the covering of

<!-- chunk -->

### all your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## Healthy Cell Membranes: Happy Mood, Clear Focus, Sharp

<!-- chunk -->

## Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 fats form the basic structure of all our cell membranes. And all life

<!-- chunk -->

### processes start and end at the surface of our cells. These surfaces are where all of

<!-- chunk -->

### the biological “communication” in your body takes place. Every instruction you

<!-- chunk -->

### need to survive is communicated from one cell to the next through your cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes. Think of the cell membranes as the ears of your cells. Without

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy cell membranes you will be deaf to the call of messages coming in.

<!-- chunk -->

### You are only as healthy as your cell membranes. Changes in your cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes affect the health of your entire body. The healthier your cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes are, the healthier you will be. Let’s focus for a minute on why this is

<!-- chunk -->

### true in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain weighs only about three pounds, or 2 percent of your body

<!-- chunk -->

### weight, but it uses about 20 percent of the oxygen you breathe and about

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of the calories you consume. Your brain contains 100 billion brain cells,

<!-- chunk -->

### with trillions of supportive cells to protect and defend them called glial cells (the

<!-- chunk -->

### immune cells of the brain).

<!-- chunk -->

### Each brain cell is connected to every other brain cell by about 40,000

<!-- chunk -->

### connections (called synapses). So let’s see,40,000 x 100,000,000,000. That is

<!-- chunk -->

### how many connections there are in your brain and they are all sending messages

<!-- chunk -->

### constantly!

<!-- chunk -->

### Each of those connections meet at the cell membrane.

<!-- chunk -->

### If those membranes are not healthy, the effectiveness and speed of

<!-- chunk -->

### communication slows down. That leads to poorer mental function, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, and mood disorders. There are many things that affect the wiring and

<!-- chunk -->

### connections in the brain—in fact, all the keys explained in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution do. But the membranes of your brain cells are at the heart (or brain) of

<!-- chunk -->

### the matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cell membranes are made of the following things:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Fatty acids (from wild fish and fish oil): the omega-3 fats (DHA and

<!-- chunk -->

### EPA) if you are eating well or taking fish oil, or shortening and lard, if

<!-- chunk -->

### you are not. (I discussed this above.)

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Phospholipids (choline from egg yolks, soybeans, peanuts, lentils,

<!-- chunk -->

### sesame seeds, flaxseeds): fats that contain phosphorous,

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) are the two most

<!-- chunk -->

### important.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Cholesterol (from eggs, shrimp, poultry): glue between molecules (see,

<!-- chunk -->

### you need cholesterol).

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Protein (from legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, eggs, poultry, meat,

<!-- chunk -->

### and dairy): receptors, transporters, gates, signal transducers, etc. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### where all the communication signals from other parts of the body and the

<!-- chunk -->

### environment get processed. (I will be talking more about protein after we

<!-- chunk -->

### discuss phospholipids.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Besides the omega-3 fats, which make up much of your cell membrane,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is another class of compounds called phospholipids, which are equally

<!-- chunk -->

### crucial for building membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### These fatty substances are critical for optimal brain function and the

<!-- chunk -->

### research has borne out the benefits of these nature-made molecules. If your cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes are your brain’s ears, then PS and PC are your brain’s “eardrums.”

<!-- chunk -->

### They are the listening interface of every cell and receive the communications all

<!-- chunk -->

### of your other cells are sending. If your cells are not made of the right materials,

<!-- chunk -->

### you will be “deaf ” and become not only dumb but also depressed and demented!

<!-- chunk -->

### Your cell membranes are made up of the fats you consume. If those

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes are made of trans fats and beef fat, they become stiff and hard like

<!-- chunk -->

### lard or Crisco. As a result, communication gets stopped up. It’s hard for things to

<!-- chunk -->

### get in or out—for information to pass smoothly from one cell membrane to the

<!-- chunk -->

### next—when your cell membranes harden this way.

<!-- chunk -->

### If they are made from omega-3 fats and phospholipids your cell membranes

<!-- chunk -->

### become fluid and flexible, allowing easy communication from cell to cell. Think

<!-- chunk -->

### about the cold-water fish swimming in arctic waters. Their bodies have high

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of fat to preserve heat, but must be fluid so they can swim and move in icy

<!-- chunk -->

### waters. Your cell membranes need to be fluid and smooth like those fish.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most abundant fats in your cell membranes are phospholipids. PS, in

<!-- chunk -->

### particular, is found in all cell membranes. In fact, it is in all cells in all life-

<!-- chunk -->

### forms. It is one of the building blocks of nature, and the human brain has

<!-- chunk -->

### extremely high amounts of it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using PS supplements has been proven effective in improving memory and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function,


<!-- chunk -->

### boosting mood and stress reduction,


<!-- chunk -->

### improving attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### and reducing aggression in children with ADHD. And it has no side effects!

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless you eat a lot of organ meats (like liver, kidney, and brains, often

<!-- chunk -->

### prized in traditional cultures), which is not a good idea because they store toxins,

<!-- chunk -->

### you may need to supplement with PS. I will discuss this in more detail in Part IV,

<!-- chunk -->

### where I give you my plan to optimize your brain with nutrients.


<!-- chunk -->

### The other main phospholipid is PC. The effects of PC are widespread

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout our bodies and brains. It is the most abundant molecule in your cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes. It helps make new brain cells, and helps maintain attention,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, memory, and mood, as well as boost detoxification. And it

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces the stress hormone, cortisol, which is harmful to the brain, as you will

<!-- chunk -->

### learn in chapter 12.

<!-- chunk -->

### How does PC do all this?

<!-- chunk -->

### It contains a vitamin called “choline,” which is essential for producing

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is one of the major neurotransmitters responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for memory, motor function, and the function of your autonomic nervous system,

<!-- chunk -->

### which regulates your unconscious bodily functions like breathing, heart rate,

<!-- chunk -->

### digestion, and all your organ functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### PC is one of the raw materials that make up your body. Without it, you can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have healthy membranes, control your organ function, remember things, repair

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain, effectively eliminate toxins, or control inflammation. This chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### sets the stage for addressing any problem with mood, memory, attention, and

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best sources of choline are lecithin (essentially a dietary source of PC

<!-- chunk -->

### that comes from egg yolks and soybeans; it can be taken as a supplement), eggs,

<!-- chunk -->

### sardines, soybeans, nuts, and peanuts.

<!-- chunk -->

### The protein receptors for all your brain neurotransmitters sit inside the fatty

<!-- chunk -->

### cell membrane. When the membrane is rigid, the receptors can’t work and your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain doesn’t function well. A fluid membrane improves the structure and

<!-- chunk -->

### function of protein receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin (depression),

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine (attention), acetylcholine (memory). Fluid membranes also improve

<!-- chunk -->

### the function of enzymes and ion channels in the membrane, leading to better cell

<!-- chunk -->

### communication and signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 5: A normal cell membrane and a damaged cell membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### Just eating a can of sardines (which are full of healthy omega-3 fats and

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipids) will help your brain grow, improve connections, make mood

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals work better, help cells communicate better, reduce inflammation, and

<!-- chunk -->

### improve the function of every cell in your body by giving them the fats they

<!-- chunk -->

### need to build smooth, fluid membranes that communicate information easily.

<!-- chunk -->

### And all that with a few bites of lunch!

<!-- chunk -->

### To find out if omega-3 fat deficiency is a problem for you, you can go to

<!-- chunk -->

### http://efaeducation.nih.gov, enter your diet, and see the omega-3 content of your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Or you can simply complete the quiz I gave you above to get a sense for

<!-- chunk -->

### whether or not you have nutritional deficiencies in this area.

<!-- chunk -->

### Building healthy cell membranes is essential to fixing your broken brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jane’s story is a great example.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jane was a forty-two-year-old Ivy League college professor who found

<!-- chunk -->

### herself unable to think, focus, or remember scientific papers that had been a

<!-- chunk -->

### critical part of her world. Brain fog and a dark cloud of depression so limited

<!-- chunk -->

### her ability to function, that she went on disability leave.

<!-- chunk -->

### By taking a careful history and doing some blood testing, I found that she

<!-- chunk -->

### was living in a house full of toxic molds. These molds produce highly toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules as part of their defense mechanisms. They damage cells and cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes leading to all the symptoms Jane experienced.

<!-- chunk -->

### We matched the molds found in her house to the mold antibodies and toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### in her blood. Based on that, she was able to get her insurance company to pay

<!-- chunk -->

### for the demolition and the rebuilding of her house.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once we had her out of the toxic environment, we rebuilt her brain through

<!-- chunk -->

### a program of detoxification and an oil change with PC and omega-3 fats. She

<!-- chunk -->

### has now fully recovered and the brain fog and cloud of depression are gone.

<!-- chunk -->

### So now you know what your cell membranes are made of and why it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### important to keep them healthy. But how do messages flow from one cell to the

<!-- chunk -->

### next? That is where proteins and neurotransmitters come into the story.

# SECTION 1.2

# Protein and Amino Acids: The Building Blocks of

# Neurotransmitters, the Language of Mood and

# Memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain is built from fat. The cell membranes are made of omega-3 fats,

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol, and the phospholipids PC and PS. You have learned why these are

<!-- chunk -->

### so important, but they are only half the story. Those trillions of cell membranes

<!-- chunk -->

### are the ears that “listen” for messages that tell your brain to be happy or sad, to

<!-- chunk -->

### focus or be inattentive, to forget or remember, to be sluggish or full of energy, to

<!-- chunk -->

### feel pain or pleasure, to relax or be stressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### The other half of the story is protein, specifically the amino-acid building

<!-- chunk -->

### blocks of protein that get transformed in your body into the messengers, or

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, which do the “talking” in your brain and throughout your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Protein is also used to build the little receptors, or docking stations, for

<!-- chunk -->

### these neurotransmitters that are embedded in your cell membranes. So if your

<!-- chunk -->

### cells are going to “hear” anything at all, they need protein to help them do it.

<!-- chunk -->

### All protein is built from special building blocks called amino acids. The

<!-- chunk -->

### only function of your DNA is to take these amino acids and string them together

<!-- chunk -->

### in chains to make protein. That’s all it does!

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 6: Amino-acid building blocks for neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### All of the thousands of molecules in your body are built from only eight

<!-- chunk -->

### essential amino acids that we must get from our diet. These essential amino acids

<!-- chunk -->

### are the raw materials we use to make all our brain messenger chemicals or

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters and the receptors or docking stations on our cells that they

<!-- chunk -->

### land on to transmit their messages.

<!-- chunk -->

### The only source of these amino acids is the protein you eat in your diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ideally the majority of this comes from fish, chicken, beans, nuts, and seeds. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you don’t eat adequate protein at every meal, your brain can’t work. You will be

<!-- chunk -->

### sluggish, foggy, anxious, unfocused, tired, and depressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that taking individual amino acids is extraordinarily

<!-- chunk -->

### effective and safe. So even if you aren’t getting enough of the specific amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acids you need for optimal brain function, you can acquire them through

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements. And, if you have a genetic predisposition that requires you to take

<!-- chunk -->

### more of these amino acids than a normal diet would allow, you can still get them.

<!-- chunk -->

### We will deal with how to properly supplement your diet with amino acids in

<!-- chunk -->

### Part IV of this book. Now, let’s focus on the neurotransmitters your amino acids

<!-- chunk -->

### create, what they do, and their critical role in brain function, and talk about how

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional deficiency leads to a dramatic breakdown in your neurotransmitters.

# What Do Neurotransmitters Do?

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a closer look at the neurotransmitters and their receptors, because

<!-- chunk -->

### at the end of the day without the proper balance of these molecules you cannot

<!-- chunk -->

### be happy, mentally alert, remember things, concentrate, or effectively do

<!-- chunk -->

### anything your brain is designed to do.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters are the messenger molecules produced by nerve cells to

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate and control almost every function of your body. This is the way

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain “talks.” Each nerve cell releases different neurotransmitters, which

<!-- chunk -->

### then have to find a spot, or “receptor,” on another cell, bind to it, and

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate instructions for that cell. Once it is released, it can be recycled or

<!-- chunk -->

### broken down and destroyed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of psychiatry and its tools—the drugs or psychopharmacology on

<!-- chunk -->

### which psychiatry is largely based—focus on mimicking or increasing the effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of these neurotransmitters in some way that works against the body’s natural

<!-- chunk -->

### processes.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, antidepressants typically increase the availability of serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### (the happy mood molecule) or norepinephrine (a stimulating and energy-giving

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter); stimulants increase dopamine effects (the pleasure and reward

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter that is responsible for attention and focus); Alzheimer’s drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### increase acetylcholine (which is responsible for memory and focus); and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs increase GABA (which puts the brakes on your excitatory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters).

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 7: A neurotransmitter “communicating” with another cell

<!-- chunk -->

### By increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters through

<!-- chunk -->

### medications, psychiatrists attempt to counteract the problems that low levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### these chemicals create in the body and mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine show up as depression, low

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine as attention and behavior disorders, low acetylcholine as Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### and low GABA as anxiety. These are literally the chemical messengers of mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, attention, memory, and overall brain function—they determine how

<!-- chunk -->

### you feel, how fast you learn, and how much you remember.

<!-- chunk -->

### Artificially boosting these molecules in the brain with medication does not

<!-- chunk -->

### fix the cause of your broken brain. But here is the real problem with this kind of

<!-- chunk -->

### drug therapy: we are asking the wrong question!

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead of asking which neurotransmitter we need more of or less of and

<!-- chunk -->

### then designing a drug to increase chemicals or block them as a means to generate

<!-- chunk -->

### this effect, we should be asking why these neurotransmitter levels are too low or

<!-- chunk -->

### too high in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take serotonin, for example. This is the neurotransmitter that is responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for a happy mood. The more serotonin in your bloodstream, the happier you will

<!-- chunk -->

### be. Imagine something wonderful happens to you one day—a job promotion, for

<!-- chunk -->

### example. Your brain sends out serotonin as a response to this event. It binds with

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors on your cells, delivering this message of happiness, and you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### amazing.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has been shown that people who are depressed tend to make less

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin than the “normal” population. As a result they experience less

<!-- chunk -->

### happiness and become depressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### A billion-dollar drug sector has arisen in response to this need for more

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin in depressed patients. Their answer is to create a drug that blocks

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin from being reabsorbed back into the end of your nerve cells after it has

<!-- chunk -->

### sent its happy messages (which is what normally happens with the chemical).

<!-- chunk -->

### This leaves more serotonin around to create the same happy messages over and

<!-- chunk -->

### over again.

<!-- chunk -->

### These drugs are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The

<!-- chunk -->

### chief among them is Prozac, and they are one of the top-selling classes of drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### in the world today.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this whole industry is working at the wrong end of the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### We never ask why your serotonin levels are low in the first place or why

<!-- chunk -->

### your serotonin delivery system isn’t working as it was designed to—sending the

<!-- chunk -->

### right messages but not being “heard” by your cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do we have some basic defect that destines 25 percent of us to have a major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression at some point in our lives or millions more to have a “minor”

<!-- chunk -->

### depression?

<!-- chunk -->

### The answers are available. (You can replenish serotonin from the ground up

<!-- chunk -->

### and help your receptors “listen” better, as you will learn in a moment.) But

<!-- chunk -->

### hardly anyone, except the tireless scientists who ask these questions, knows

<!-- chunk -->

### about it. Unfortunately, these scientists don’t have billions of dollars to create

<!-- chunk -->

### television ads promoting their work like the makers of Zoloft or Prozac do!

<!-- chunk -->

### This program is designed to support and enhance the creation and operation

<!-- chunk -->

### of your neurotransmitters and the receptors on which they dock and

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate their important information. If you are on psychiatric medications

<!-- chunk -->

### right now, the UltraMind Solution promises to enhance their effectiveness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### may allow you to come off them. If you aren’t, it may offer you a solution to the

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, attention, and behavior problems you face without the need for

<!-- chunk -->

### medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### To understand how this works, I want to introduce you to four of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### important neurotransmitters and explain how nutrition has an impact on their

<!-- chunk -->

### creation and performance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Four Key Neurotransmitters: Dopamine, Acetylcholine,

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin, and GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### These four key neurotransmitters can be subdivided into two major

<!-- chunk -->

### categories. Think of them as on and off switches for your brain. Those that

<!-- chunk -->

### excite and activate you, and those that make you calm and happy. Think of them

<!-- chunk -->

### as the gas and the brake pedals for your nervous system—the yin and yang of

<!-- chunk -->

### your nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those that make you feel energized, excited, and stimulated, and help you

<!-- chunk -->

### focus, learn, and remember, are called excitatory neurotransmitters. The

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters in this category that I will discuss are dopamine (and its close

<!-- chunk -->

### cousins, epinephrine and norepinephrine) and acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those that make you happy, relaxed, and peaceful are called inhibitory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters. I will discuss GABA and serotonin here.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other players, but the basic theme is that your nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system has a gas pedal and a brake. The key is to keep all the brain molecules in

<!-- chunk -->

### balance. If they are in balance you are happy, focused, attentive, relaxed, and

<!-- chunk -->

### able to remember and learn effectively.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is what the six-week plan in The UltraMind Solution is designed to do.

<!-- chunk -->

### Balance all the seven keys and your brain (and body) will be in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning how these four neurotransmitters work and how to balance them

<!-- chunk -->

### is a key part of optimal brain function. So let’s look at these major players:

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine and the Catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine):

<!-- chunk -->

### Getting Focused

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin: Staying Happy

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA: Getting Relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetylcholine: Learning and Remembering

<!-- chunk -->

## Dopamine and the Catecholamines: Getting Focused

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have low dopamine levels? Take this quiz to find out.


<!-- chunk -->

### out how severe your problem is by using the scoring key below.

# DOPAMINE QUIZ*

<!-- chunk -->

### I feel down or depressed a lot and don’t have the energy or desire to

<!-- chunk -->

### do anything.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am a low-energy kind of person mentally or physically.

<!-- chunk -->

### I struggle to get motivated to exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have trouble concentrating or focusing on things.

<!-- chunk -->

### I tend to sleep a lot or have trouble waking up.

<!-- chunk -->

### I need substances such as caffeine, chocolate, “diet pills,” or even

<!-- chunk -->

### cocaine to “wake” me up.


<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key—Dopamine


<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine is the pleasure and reward neurotransmitter. It is responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and focusing. It motivates you and stimulates you to engage in life. Its

<!-- chunk -->

### close cousins are the stimulating and energy-giving neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### epinephrine and norepinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### All three are built from the amino acid tyrosine, which in turn comes from

<!-- chunk -->

### the essential dietary amino acid phenylalanine. Supplementing your diet with

<!-- chunk -->

### both of these amino acids can help mood, energy, and attention. You get these

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acids by eating high-quality protein such as beans, nuts, seeds, and lean

<!-- chunk -->

### poultry, fish, and eggs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dopamine levels are low in addicts, in people with low-energy types of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression as opposed to an agitated or anxious type of depression, and in people

<!-- chunk -->

### with ADHD. Stimulant drugs like Ritalin are designed to mimic dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. That is why they are prescribed to people with ADHD. Cocaine, speed,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a cup of coffee also mimic dopamine’s effects. But taking any of these drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### over time (Ritalin included) depletes your body’s ability to make your own

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.

<!-- chunk -->

### This neurotransmitter is also low in Parkinson’s disease. The flat, slow, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sluggish appearance of people with Parkinson’s disease is because they can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### produce enough dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a dopamine receptor that isn’t very good at “listening” to the

<!-- chunk -->

### signals, then any little stress or toxic influence like mercury can trigger a

<!-- chunk -->

### problem because toxins can interfere with the receptors’ ability to listen to

<!-- chunk -->

### messages. Genetic variations in dopamine receptors have been found in people

<!-- chunk -->

### with autism and ADHD.

11;12

<!-- chunk -->

### So even if you have enough dopamine, the

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors may not work as well, leading to ADHD, autism, and mood disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that we can improve the function of these receptors with

<!-- chunk -->

### proper nutrition (remember how fats influence neurotransmitter and receptor

<!-- chunk -->

### production) and vitamin supplementation (especially folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , which

<!-- chunk -->

### you will learn more about a little later in this chapter). Both improve your cells’

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to “listen” as well as produce more neurotransmitters.


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s why studies show that supplementing with the amino acid tyrosine,

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as essential fats (omega-3 fats, PC, and PS) and special nutrients (folate,


<!-- chunk -->

### ), can improve depression, ADHD, and Parkinson’s.


<!-- chunk -->

### These nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### give your body what it needs to function as it was designed, and to repair the

<!-- chunk -->

### damage that leads to conditions like these in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, nutrients often work better than conventional medication and

<!-- chunk -->

### without side effects, because they are part of your brain’s natural raw materials

<!-- chunk -->

### and design.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tyrosine is a wonderful, safe, cheap way to boost dopamine levels. Even

<!-- chunk -->

### the military has researched it and uses it to boost physical and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### performance during stressful conditions.


<!-- chunk -->

### (In fact, I am using it to help me stay

<!-- chunk -->

### focused and write this book!) And the amino acid phenylalanine can be very

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful in boosting the other energy-giving, motivating, and focusing

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter norepinephrine. You will learn more tips on how to do this in

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter 22.

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin: Staying Happy

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have low serotonin levels? Take the following quiz to find out.


<!-- chunk -->

### out how severe your problem is by using the scoring key below.

# SEROTONIN QUIZ*

<!-- chunk -->

### My head is full of ANTS (automatic negative thoughts).

<!-- chunk -->

### I am a glass half-empty person.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have low self-esteem and self-confidence.

<!-- chunk -->

### I tend to have obsessive thoughts and behaviors (such as being a perfectionist

<!-- chunk -->

### or neat freak, or other more severe forms of OCD).

<!-- chunk -->

### I get the winter blues or have SAD (seasonal affective disorder).

<!-- chunk -->

### I tend to be irritable, easily angered, and/or impatient.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am shy and afraid of going out or have fear of heights, crowds, flying,

<!-- chunk -->

### and/or speaking in public.

<!-- chunk -->

### I feel anxious or have panic attacks.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have PMS (premenstrual syndrome with moodiness, cravings, breast

<!-- chunk -->

### tenderness, and bloating before my period).

<!-- chunk -->

### I have trouble falling asleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, or

<!-- chunk -->

### wake up too early in the morning.

<!-- chunk -->

### I crave sweets or starchy carbs like bread and pasta.

<!-- chunk -->

### I feel better when I exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have muscle aches, fibromyalgia, and/or jaw pain (TMJ).

<!-- chunk -->

### I have been treated with and felt better when taking SSRIs (serotonin-boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants).


<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key–Serotonin


<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone knows about serotonin. It is the feel-good molecule we are all in

<!-- chunk -->

### short supply of in our overstressed society. A severe lack of it is what makes

<!-- chunk -->

### people feel depressed. We use drugs like Prozac and Zoloft to make it more

<!-- chunk -->

### available to us, but these create problems for us in the long run, as you now

<!-- chunk -->

### know.

<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, one of the reasons most people eat refined carbohydrates or

<!-- chunk -->

### sugars is to boost serotonin levels temporarily (which is one of the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### these sugars), then they crash, which sends them out hunting for something

<!-- chunk -->

### starchy or sugary. Unfortunately, this ultimately makes us feel more depressed

<!-- chunk -->

### and causes us to gain weight—not a very effective strategy.

<!-- chunk -->

### We certainly know that serotonin is necessary for a happy mood, reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and irritability, and helping us to sleep. But why are our serotonin levels

<!-- chunk -->

### so low, and how does the body naturally produce serotonin? If we know that, we

<!-- chunk -->

### can take away the things that reduce serotonin and provide the things that help

<!-- chunk -->

### the body make more. And we can do this with much greater effectiveness and

<!-- chunk -->

### fewer side effects than medication.

<!-- chunk -->

## Why Your Serotonin Levels Are Low

<!-- chunk -->

### In the daily activity of any neurotransmitter there are so many things that

<!-- chunk -->

### can go wrong and cause it to malfunction in some way. Here is why serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### levels go south.

<!-- chunk -->

### A tryptophan-deficient or low-protein diet. Tryptophan is the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acid out of which serotonin is created. No tryptophan equals no

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin equals a very unhappy mood. In fact, studies show that if you

<!-- chunk -->

### feed a group of people a mixture of amino acids without tryptophan you

<!-- chunk -->

### can induce depression within hours!


<!-- chunk -->

### Stress and high cortisol levels (the stress hormone). Cortisol increases the

<!-- chunk -->

### activity of enzymes that break down tryptophan. That leaves less around

<!-- chunk -->

### to make serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anything that causes inflammation (such as food allergies, infections,

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, or a high-sugar diet). Inflammatory messenger molecules called

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines such as interferon gamma (INF γ) stimulate the enzymes TDO

<!-- chunk -->

### and IDO, which break down tryptophan and force it into a pathway that

<!-- chunk -->

### makes the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which kills brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simply not making enough serotonin. This happens for many reasons.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may not have enough of the building blocks (the amino-acid

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan) because you eat too much sugar and not enough protein as

<!-- chunk -->

### suggested above, or you may have genetic predispositions that make it

<!-- chunk -->

### more difficult for you to create the neurotransmitter in the first place.*

<!-- chunk -->

### Blood-sugar imbalances (insulin resistance or prediabetes). This

<!-- chunk -->

### condition (which you will learn more about in chapter 7) comes from

<!-- chunk -->

### eating a processed-food, high-sugar diet. It depletes your serotonin after a

<!-- chunk -->

### short spike, leading to mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may be deficient in vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . B


<!-- chunk -->

### is the helper or catalyst for the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. Deficiency in B


<!-- chunk -->

### is often

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by stress, alcohol, and medications like birth-control pills.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium deficiency. This is so common in our society because stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeine, sugar, and alcohol all deplete magnesium, which in turn

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents the body from making serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those are just a few of the ways that the production of one neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### can be inhibited. And every one of them is similarly influenced by your diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### lifestyle. So let’s see . . . what are your options here? Take Prozac, an SSRI,

<!-- chunk -->

### which helps to improve half the symptoms half the time with plenty of side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects, or try to cut out sugar in your diet, eliminate food allergies and toxins,

<!-- chunk -->

### learn how to manage stress, and take B


<!-- chunk -->

### , folate, magnesium, and amino acids,

<!-- chunk -->

### which have no side effects and correct the cause of your depleted serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### production in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### What would you choose?

<!-- chunk -->

### When Prozac came on the market, most of the research on the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan or its by-product, 5-HTP, to help the body naturally produce

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin, slowed way down or was stopped.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the evidence is strong that supplementing with the building blocks of

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin, while at the same time addressing the other underlying reasons for

<!-- chunk -->

### low-serotonin production, is not only safer but more effective than just taking

<!-- chunk -->

### Prozac or other SSRIs.

17;18

<!-- chunk -->

### No one has committed suicide because he or she was taking vitamins or

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acids, but there is up to a 60 percent increased risk of suicide attempts in

<!-- chunk -->

### people taking some types of antidepressants and an overall 39 percent increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### suicide from all antidepressants.


<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t hear about nutritional treatments

<!-- chunk -->

### like these, because supplement manufacturers don’t have billions to advertise on

<!-- chunk -->

### television or millions to fund large studies the way pharmaceutical companies

<!-- chunk -->

### do.

<!-- chunk -->

### In chapter 22, you will learn how to fix low serotonin levels naturally, using

<!-- chunk -->

### the concepts I have discussed here.

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA: Get Relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have low GABA levels? Take the following quiz to find out.


# GABA QUIZ,*

<!-- chunk -->

### It is hard for me to relax and kick back.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am easily stressed out or overwhelmed.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is common for me to feel overworked or pressured.

<!-- chunk -->

### My body is stiff or uptight.

<!-- chunk -->

### I sometimes feel weak and shaky.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am bothered by loud noises, lights, or too much activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### I feel more anxious or stressed if I skip meals.

<!-- chunk -->

### I use substances such as sugar, alcohol, and/or drugs to help me

<!-- chunk -->

### relax.


<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key—GABA


<!-- chunk -->

### We are a stressed-out society. And we push ourselves to burnout with habits

<!-- chunk -->

### like overworking, not enough sleep, too much coffee, too much sugar, refined

<!-- chunk -->

### foods, and junk food that we use to temporarily relieve our stress, as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to environmental toxins and silent infections.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your adrenal glands produce powerful chemicals (cortisol, epinephrine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine) that help you respond to stress. These chemicals are excitatory

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, neurotransmitters that get our bodies ready for dangerous situations

<!-- chunk -->

### (which was the original purpose of the anxiety response).

<!-- chunk -->

### However, with your foot to the gas pedal like this all the time, you burn out

<!-- chunk -->

### and feel stressed, anxious, exhausted, can’t sleep, and are either tired or wired

<!-- chunk -->

### constantly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, our brains have an antidote to these stress hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and it calms the brain from

<!-- chunk -->

### too much of the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. It is like a

<!-- chunk -->

### brake on overstimulation in the brain. When you have low levels of GABA, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### harder for you to relax after your body has released these excitatory

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### People with anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, seizures, and schizophrenia all

<!-- chunk -->

### have low levels of GABA. Who likes the feeling of tense muscles, a pounding

<!-- chunk -->

### heart, dry mouth, sleeplessness, fatigue, and sweaty palms? No one. That’s why

<!-- chunk -->

### so many self-medicate with the medications mentioned above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valium works by imitating GABA, our natural brain relaxant. Many use

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol or marijuana to self-medicate for anxiety. These too act like GABA in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. But using alcohol, marijuana, or tranquilizers backfires because they

<!-- chunk -->

### are all addictive and produce diminishing returns over time so you need more

<!-- chunk -->

### and more to “relax.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Why not just take GABA supplements? Well, thankfully, you can. And you

<!-- chunk -->

### can use other natural substances to boost GABA levels to overcome the anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### that millions of you experience every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study showed that within sixty minutes of taking GABA, alpha brain

<!-- chunk -->

### waves (a sign of relaxation) were increased on EEG tests. Taking GABA also

<!-- chunk -->

### boosted the immune system, which functions best when you are relaxed.


<!-- chunk -->

### You can take GABA supplements directly, or supplement your diet with the

<!-- chunk -->

### raw materials out of which GABA is produced. For example, another key amino-

<!-- chunk -->

### I find it hard to do math in my head.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have a hard time finding words or remembering what I was saying

<!-- chunk -->

### if interrupted during a conversation.

<!-- chunk -->

### I get nervous or anxious when I have to learn something new like

<!-- chunk -->

### new software at work.

<!-- chunk -->

### When reading a book or watching a movie I find it harder to follow

<!-- chunk -->

### the plot than it used to be.

### I misplace my keys, wallet, or glasses frequently.

<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key—Acetylcholine


<!-- chunk -->

## Score Severity Care Plan Action to Take

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have trouble remembering and learning new things, chances are your

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of this very important neurotransmitter are depleted. Acetylcholine helps

<!-- chunk -->

### with sharpening your thinking process, memory, motivation, and concentration.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, the cells that produce acetylcholine in the brain are damaged in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with Alzheimer’s, which accounts for their dementia. Most of the drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### that treat dementia are designed to block the action of the enzyme that breaks

<!-- chunk -->

### down acetylcholine in the brain. In this way they are similar to SSRIs, which

<!-- chunk -->

### block the reuptake of serotonin after it has been used. But dementia drugs have

<!-- chunk -->

### even worse side effects and not much benefit.


<!-- chunk -->

### The real questions are why are your cells damaged in the first place, and

<!-- chunk -->

### how can you help your body naturally make more acetylcholine?

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that we know what damages the brain—imbalances in the

<!-- chunk -->

### seven keys—and we can address the problem systemically. We can use natural

<!-- chunk -->

### substances to help boost acetylcholine just as we can with all the other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters we have discussed in this section.

<!-- chunk -->

### This neurotransmitter is made from the B vitamin choline (as you may

<!-- chunk -->

### remember from our discussion above about PC), with the help of another B

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin called B


<!-- chunk -->

### or pantothenic acid. Eggs and lecithin from soy are great

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary sources of choline. And supplementing with PC and PS helps the body

<!-- chunk -->

### make more of it as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that what I have just described covers only four of the major

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters that dictate how you feel, how clearly you think, how attentive

<!-- chunk -->

### you are, and how well you remember things.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are dozens of others.

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution allows you to get all of them back in balance. By

<!-- chunk -->

### doing so, you take one more step away from the mood, memory, and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### problems that plague you—and one step closer to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t think this has the potential to help you heal your brain, let me

<!-- chunk -->

### tell you a story.

<!-- chunk -->

### At thirty-six, Sarah was a doctor who had long suffered a low-grade

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. She found herself anxious, unable to fall asleep easily, and often

<!-- chunk -->

### woke up at 3 A.M. unable to sleep the rest of the night.

<!-- chunk -->

### All her life she had been a perfectionist, impatient with her children, her

<!-- chunk -->

### husband, and herself.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her premenstrual syndrome had been getting worse over the years, with

<!-- chunk -->

### bloating, sugar cravings, breast tenderness, and terrible mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

### The world had always seemed to have a dullness to it, and her ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### experience joy at seeing a sunset or pleasure from her daily life felt limited. The

<!-- chunk -->

### glass always seemed half empty.

<!-- chunk -->

### She tried to live well—ate fresh whole foods, exercised regularly, and did

<!-- chunk -->

### yoga. But she just couldn’t get the dark cloud to lift. Nothing in her outer world

<!-- chunk -->

### seemed to contribute to her suffering. She had a great job, wonderful friends and

<!-- chunk -->

### family, no great stresses or losses—just no joy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Upon testing, we found she had very depleted amino acids and very low

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of vitamin B

6 ,

<!-- chunk -->

### , essential for making serotonin. It turned out she had

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic mercury toxicity, which depleted all her amino acids because they help

<!-- chunk -->

### the body get rid of toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the long run we got rid of her mercury, but in the short run, just by taking


<!-- chunk -->

### (along with its helper folate and B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) and 5 HTP (5-

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxytryptophan) to boost serotonin levels naturally, she felt the cloud lift, her

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep improve, her PMS diminish, and her ability to experience joy return.

# SECTION 1.3

# Carbohydrates: Whole Food for a Whole Brain

<!-- chunk -->

## Carbohydrates are the single most important food for long-term health

<!-- chunk -->

## and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### This may be a shocking statement given the low-carb movement and

<!-- chunk -->

### “carbophobia” in America, but it’s true.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, I don’t mean the overprocessed, refined, sugary white food we

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly think of as carbohydrates, such as doughnuts, bread, bagels, muffins,

<!-- chunk -->

### colas, juices, and most junk food.

<!-- chunk -->

### And I don’t mean the cheap, supersweet, government-subsidized high-

<!-- chunk -->

### fructose corn syrup that is driving our epidemic of obesity and disease and

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing to our epidemic of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The carbohydrates I am talking about are the real, whole, nourishing plant

<!-- chunk -->

### foods that the human species has thrived on since the dawn of evolution.

<!-- chunk -->

### In UltraMetabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss, I

<!-- chunk -->

### explained that most of the foods consumed by humans over the years have been

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates.

<!-- chunk -->

### Plant foods are composed mostly of carbohydrates:vegetables, fruits, beans,

<!-- chunk -->

### whole grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices.

<!-- chunk -->

### These foods contain slowly released sources of sugar that prevent surges of

<!-- chunk -->

### blood sugar and insulin, toxic to the brain (see chapter 7).

<!-- chunk -->

### The slowly released carbohydrates from whole, unprocessed plant foods

<!-- chunk -->

### also helps keep our serotonin levels even.

<!-- chunk -->

### Carbohydrates also contain all the vitamins (except B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) and minerals our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies need to operate normally and optimally.

<!-- chunk -->

### They also contain fiber, which helps normalize our digestive function and

<!-- chunk -->

### slows the absorption of sugar and fats into the body, which keeps us balanced.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bonus factor in plant foods are phytonutrients—colorful healing

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds made by plants to protect themselves, but which also protect us

<!-- chunk -->

### against aging, obesity, brain damage, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, broccoli and the rest of the cruciferous vegetable family

<!-- chunk -->

### contain powerful detoxifying compounds that protect us against environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins. Green tea contains anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and detoxifying

<!-- chunk -->

### properties. Resveratrol from red grapes boosts our energy production and

<!-- chunk -->

### protects our cells. These are just a few examples of the thousands of

<!-- chunk -->

### phytonutrients in the plant foods that should be the foundation of our diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Michael Pollan, the author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, summed up all

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional research in three simple principles:

<!-- chunk -->

## “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, you need know nothing else to be vibrantly healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s it. Eat real, whole food as it comes from the earth: fresh vegetables,

<!-- chunk -->

### fruits, beans, whole grains, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices, and lean animal protein

<!-- chunk -->

### like fish, chicken, and eggs. Imagine what your great-grandmother would

<!-- chunk -->

### recognize as food, or what might have been on her dinner table. Just food. There

<!-- chunk -->

### is really no such thing as junk food—there is just food, and then there is junk.

# SECTION 1.4

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamins and Minerals: Will They Give You a Metabolic Tune-Up

<!-- chunk -->

## or Just Make Expensive Urine?

<!-- chunk -->

## I don’t think people need vitamins and they are a waste of money...

<!-- chunk -->

### That is only if they eat wild, fresh, whole, organic, local, nongenetically

<!-- chunk -->

### modified food grown in virgin mineral-and nutrient-rich soils and not

<!-- chunk -->

### transported across vast distances and stored for months before being eaten. And

<!-- chunk -->

### if they work and live outside, breathe only fresh unpolluted air, drink only pure,

<!-- chunk -->

### clean water, sleep nine hours a night, move their bodies every day, and are free

<!-- chunk -->

### from chronic stressors and exposure to environmental toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then we don’t need vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### But, of course, I have described absolutely no one on the planet. In reality,

<!-- chunk -->

### we all need vitamins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people don’t understand the role of vitamins and minerals in our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies. I certainly didn’t when I finished medical training.

<!-- chunk -->

### I thought if we just had enough to prevent us from some horrible deficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### state like scurvy (vitamin C deficiency), then we didn’t have to worry about how

<!-- chunk -->

### much we were getting.

<!-- chunk -->

### I also thought that if we ate “enriched food” like white flour with a few

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins added back in, or milk with vitamin D added in, additional vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation was a waste.

<!-- chunk -->

### What most people don’t realize is the same thing I was unaware of when I

<!-- chunk -->

### first started practicing medicine: the real reason our food supply must be

<!-- chunk -->

### “enriched” is because it is so processed that it is “impoverished” to start with.

<!-- chunk -->

### So why can’t you just eat “nutrient-rich” food, instead of eating “nutrient-

<!-- chunk -->

### poor” food?

<!-- chunk -->

### Today, even with our “enriched food,” more than 92 percent of Americans

<!-- chunk -->

### are deficient in one or more vitamins. That doesn’t mean they are receiving less

<!-- chunk -->

### than the amount they need for optimal health. It means they receive less than the

<!-- chunk -->

### minimum amount necessary to prevent deficiency diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### found that 6 percent of those tested had serious vitamin C deficiency and

<!-- chunk -->

### percent were borderline low.


<!-- chunk -->

### A report in the journal Pediatrics found obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### and malnutrition coexisting. Obese, overfed, and undernourished children with

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive disorders were found to have scurvy and severe vitamin D deficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### or rickets. These deficiencies damaged their brains.


<!-- chunk -->

### You never think of

<!-- chunk -->

### overweight people as malnourished, but they can be!

<!-- chunk -->

### A USDA survey showed that 37 percent of Americans don’t get enough

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin C,70 percent not enough vitamin E, almost 75 percent not enough zinc,

<!-- chunk -->

### and 40 percent not enough iron.


<!-- chunk -->

### I would say 100 percent of us don’t have enough of the basic nutrients to

<!-- chunk -->

### create optimal health or give ourselves a metabolic tune-up.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many reasons the foods you eat no longer contain the nutrient

<!-- chunk -->

### levels you require for optimal health. Crops are raised in soil where nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### have been depleted. Plants are treated with pesticides and other chemicals so

<!-- chunk -->

### they no longer have to fight to live, which further diminishes their nutrient levels

<!-- chunk -->

### and their phytonutrient content (not to mention the toxic exposure you receive

<!-- chunk -->

### from such chemicals). Animals are cooped-up in pens or giant feedlots instead of

<!-- chunk -->

### roaming free, eating the nutrient-rich wild grains and grasses they once

<!-- chunk -->

### consumed. Since cows’stomachs are adapted to grass instead of the corn they

<!-- chunk -->

### now eat, they must take antibiotics to prevent them from exploding.

<!-- chunk -->

### To complicate this further, all of us are exposed to hazardous toxins and

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals that poison our bodies, we live with too much stress, we don’t sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### enough, we don’t exercise enough, and we are inflamed, making the nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### demands on our bodies even heavier.

<!-- chunk -->

### In today’s world everyone needs a basic multivitamin and mineral

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement. The research is overwhelming on this point.


<!-- chunk -->

### The question is not how much of a certain nutrient or vitamin do we need

<!-- chunk -->

### not to get sick, but how much do we need to be optimally healthy!* In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### lower amounts recommended by the government may not be high enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### For most people, a high-quality multivitamin; a calcium-magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement; vitamin D; fish oil; and special B vitamin complex including folate,


<!-- chunk -->

### will take care of the basics. I will give you specific guidelines on

<!-- chunk -->

### this basic supplement program in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have tested for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies in thousands of patients

<!-- chunk -->

### and found that by correcting them people feel better, improve their mood, mental

<!-- chunk -->

### sharpness, memory, and ability to focus, as well as have more energy, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### lose weight. Correcting deficiencies also helps prevent disease. I have seen

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anxiety, bipolar disease, autism, ADHD, mood swings, Parkinson’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### and dementia go away or dramatically improve.

<!-- chunk -->

### The basic vitamin recommendations outlined above (which I will discuss in

<!-- chunk -->

### more detail in Part III) include nutrients that form the backbone for proper brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function, for mood, memory, behavior, and attention problems. They are needed

<!-- chunk -->

### to fix your broken brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a look at the way nutrient deficiencies affect our health and our

<!-- chunk -->

### brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrients: The Keys to Health and Brain Power

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrients are powerful in both sickness and in health. Imagine a world where

<!-- chunk -->

### hundreds of debilitating, severe, often life-threatening diseases could be cured

<!-- chunk -->

### within days by taking substances without any side effects; substances that are

<!-- chunk -->

### completely safe and cost only pennies a day. That is the power of vitamins and

<!-- chunk -->

### minerals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now imagine that very few people were being treated with these cost-

<!-- chunk -->

### effective, safe, extremely effective strategies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imagine what the medical ward might look like.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you walked the halls you would see endless suffering: people with teeth

<!-- chunk -->

### falling out and bleeding gums, blindness, insanity, dementia, scaly bloody skin,

<!-- chunk -->

### uncontrollable diarrhea, severe depression, diabetes, and heart attacks. You

<!-- chunk -->

### would see people unable to walk because of lack of balance, children unable to

<!-- chunk -->

### talk and locked in their inner worlds, those whose bones bend under the weight

<!-- chunk -->

### of their bodies, people with loss of nerve function, severe infections that can’t be

<!-- chunk -->

### cured with antibiotics, pale skin, hair falling all over the floor, and peeling or

<!-- chunk -->

### grossly deformed fingernails that take the shape of spoons.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the symptoms of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Today we live

<!-- chunk -->

### in such a world. For some, symptoms of nutrient deficiency may be subtle. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, they are often invisible. But they cause no less suffering.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the day-to-day complaints we think we have to live with as we age

<!-- chunk -->

### are the result of nutritional deficiencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### These nutritional deficiencies range from problems like the epidemic of

<!-- chunk -->

### broken brains (which can be traced back to our nutrient-depleted toxic diet) to

<!-- chunk -->

### problems like reflux, allergies, and asthma to chronic diseases like heart disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, and cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whether you are suffering from a bad mood, difficulty concentrating, or

<!-- chunk -->

### have a more serious condition such as depression or Alzheimer’s disease, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### likely that nutritional deficiencies are one of the primary causes.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is not a nutrition textbook, but I must focus on a few important

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients for optimal brain function, how they affect your mind and body, and

<!-- chunk -->

### what happens if you don’t get them. Essential nutrients are called “essential”

<!-- chunk -->

### because they are just that. Without them we cannot survive and thrive. That is

<!-- chunk -->

### why I recommend that everyone take a full complement of essential nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### every day. I will explain which nutrients you need to take daily in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some may need more or less of these nutrients, and some may need a

<!-- chunk -->

### special form. But we all need all of them. They work to run your biochemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without them, the functions of your mind and body slow down or grind to a halt.

<!-- chunk -->

### These nutrients are the stuff of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you need a study to tell you that you need to drink water, breathe air,

<!-- chunk -->

### and sleep every night? You don’t need a study to know you require these

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients either (though there are literally hundreds of studies that prove you do).

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the essential ingredients for being alive. It is that simple.

# SPECIAL NOTE ON CONDITIONALLY ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies are resourceful and make most of what we need from a very few

<!-- chunk -->

### basic raw materials. However, under certain conditions, such as stress, toxicity,

<!-- chunk -->

### medication use, infection, genetic variations, or aging, we may need what are

<!-- chunk -->

### called “conditionally essential” nutrients. They are called that because they are

<!-- chunk -->

### needed under certain special conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the brain-supportive nutrients, including amino acids like

<!-- chunk -->

### tyrosine, special fats like phosphatidylserine, or parts of our normal

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemistry such as coenzyme Q10, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, and

<!-- chunk -->

### others, fall into this category.

<!-- chunk -->

### While not everyone may need them, many of us do, particularly if we are

<!-- chunk -->

### in the category of the 162 million with chronic illness. They are very helpful in

<!-- chunk -->

### clearing up biochemical traffic jams and train wrecks and making things run the

<!-- chunk -->

### way they were designed so we can function optimally and thrive in every way—

<!-- chunk -->

### mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually.

<!-- chunk -->

## A New Model of Nutrition: Turning “Minimum Daily

<!-- chunk -->

## Requirements” Upside Down

<!-- chunk -->

### Doctors learn that vitamins are important to prevent deficiency diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### (diseases caused by a lack of specific vitamins or minerals) like scurvy or

<!-- chunk -->

### rickets. Too little vitamin C and you get scurvy. Too little vitamin D and you get

<!-- chunk -->

### rickets. That’s it. That is the extent of our nutritional training.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, there is a new concept emerging. Having enough of a nutrient to

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent one of these deficiency diseases, but not enough to optimize cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### function, will lead to “long-latency” deficiency diseases (diseases that take a

<!-- chunk -->

### long time to manifest themselves) like heart disease, cancer, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, attention-deficit disorder, or Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, if you are severely deficient in folic acid, you will have

<!-- chunk -->

### anemia after a few months, or have a baby with birth defects. This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency disease. But if you don’t have enough folic acid for optimal function

<!-- chunk -->

### over thirty to forty years, you will double your risk of Alzheimer’s disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is a long-latency deficiency disease. There are dozens of examples like

<!-- chunk -->

### this of diseases caused by long-term nutrient deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s examine our old model of nutrition, and how we need a radically

<!-- chunk -->

### different view if we are to effectively address, not only our broken brains but

<!-- chunk -->

### also all chronic illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The old model of nutrition is based on providing the minimum amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to prevent deficiency diseases. The questions

<!-- chunk -->

### being asked are: how much vitamin C is needed to prevent scurvy? How much

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine is needed to prevent beriberi? How much niacin is needed to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### pellagra? How much vitamin D is needed to prevent rickets?

<!-- chunk -->

### The answer is not very much.

<!-- chunk -->

### Understanding the role of vitamins and minerals in health this way is based

<!-- chunk -->

### on the concept that individual nutrients have one physiological role: to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### the deficiency diseases. Vitamin C prevents scurvy. Vitamin D prevents rickets.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s it. As long as you don’t have those problems, you are getting enough of

<!-- chunk -->

### the vitamins and minerals you need.

<!-- chunk -->

### The current dietary reference intakes (DRIs), or the amount of nutrients we

<!-- chunk -->

### are told is safe and desirable by the government, are based on this outdated

<!-- chunk -->

### concept. Oddly, the USDA, or United States Department of Agriculture, not the

<!-- chunk -->

### Health and Human Services Department, sets the DRIs. Unfortunately, our

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional needs, agricultural policy, and government subsidies of our industrial

<!-- chunk -->

### food supply compete with each other. The subsidies are primarily for corn and

<!-- chunk -->

### soybeans, which are used to make high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats, and most

<!-- chunk -->

### of the raw materials for the fast food, junk food, and processed food industry.

<!-- chunk -->

### Policy often overrides science in the end.

<!-- chunk -->

### The thinking that led us to believe the DRIs are suitable recommendations

<!-- chunk -->

### for what we need to operate optimally is no longer scientifically sound. Since the

<!-- chunk -->

### human genome has been deciphered, we now recognize that there is vast

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical variability within the population.

<!-- chunk -->

## We all have unique nutritional and biochemical needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using a single baseline for determining the dietary reference intakes for

<!-- chunk -->

### different people in the population does not fit with our understanding of this

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical diversity. Different people have different needs. Some need more of

<!-- chunk -->

### particular types of vitamins and minerals than others.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s more, there is mounting evidence that taking just enough of a

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin to avoid deficiency diseases doesn’t give you nearly enough of that

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin to achieve optimal health.

<!-- chunk -->

### To understand this, we need to take a look at how your genetic makeup, the

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients you consume, and special proteins called enzymes all work together to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine how healthy or ill you are mentally and physically.

<!-- chunk -->

### This information is going to revolutionize the way you think about your

<!-- chunk -->

### health.

<!-- chunk -->

### So how are genes and vitamins connected?

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamins, Genes, and Enzymes: Making Things Happen in Your

<!-- chunk -->

## Body

<!-- chunk -->

### Humans have approximately thirty thousand genes. In that sense we are not

<!-- chunk -->

### that different from an earthworm.

<!-- chunk -->

### What makes humans different from earthworms (and from each other) is the

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.5 to 3 million subtle differences in their genes called polymorphisms (single

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). These slight alterations in your genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### structure determine everything—all the quirky, individual tendencies you have.

<!-- chunk -->

### They also create the unique biochemical needs within the population.

<!-- chunk -->

### How?

<!-- chunk -->

### The only function of your DNA is to make proteins, as I said earlier (page

<!-- chunk -->

### 95). Enzymes are one of thousands of proteins created from your DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, these particular proteins are critically important, because they are the

<!-- chunk -->

### catalysts that help turn one molecule into another—they are the helpers that slow

<!-- chunk -->

### down or speed up all the trillions of chemical reactions that happen every second

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrients, in turn, control the function of these enzymes. They tell your

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes what to do. They turn on or turn off the chemical reactions in your


<!-- chunk -->

## Making Happy Mood Chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at how we make serotonin as an example of how this works.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is a peptide (which is just a little protein) known as a neurotransmitter,

<!-- chunk -->

### which boosts our mood. You don’t eat serotonin, but your body makes it. It

<!-- chunk -->

### builds serotonin from the amino-acid tryptophan that comes from the protein in

<!-- chunk -->

### our turkey sandwich.

<!-- chunk -->

### The enzyme designed to convert tryptophan from turkey into serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### needs vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , or pyridoxine, to help it perform its chemical wizardry. No B


<!-- chunk -->

### no enzyme reaction, no serotonin, no happy mood. The result? Depression—

<!-- chunk -->

### along with a host of other potential problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 8: Conversion of dietary protein to serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### But the real critical element in this equation is you. You may need more B


<!-- chunk -->

### to get your enzymes to turn tryptophan into serotonin than your next-door

<!-- chunk -->

### neighbor does. Your genes may not have created an enzyme that is as responsive

<!-- chunk -->

### to B


<!-- chunk -->

### as your neighbor’s enzymes are, or just runs a little more slowly. Hence

<!-- chunk -->

### you need more B


<!-- chunk -->

### to do the job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why?

<!-- chunk -->

### Because you are a genetically unique individual. As a result your enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### are constructed differently and respond to nutrients differently than those of your

<!-- chunk -->

### neighbors. About one-third (or 1 million) of your SNPs (the variations in your

<!-- chunk -->

### genes) are dedicated solely to the job of determining how effectively your

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes are controlled by the nutrients you consume!

<!-- chunk -->

### Why is this critical to your health? If you understand that one-third of the

<!-- chunk -->

### entire variation in your genetic code affects the function of your enzymes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### that nutrients are the control switches for those enzymes, you will want to make

<!-- chunk -->

### sure you have all the right raw materials (nutrients) to make those enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### function optimally.

<!-- chunk -->

### Right?

<!-- chunk -->

### What happens if you don’t get the right nutrients to help your enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### function optimally? It’s simple: you get sick. If your enzymes run too slowly or

<!-- chunk -->

### too quickly your core systems get pushed out of balance. The results are mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, illness, and weight gain. Controlling the function of your enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### means controlling your health.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why nutrients are so essential. Without them, your biochemical

<!-- chunk -->

### wheels grind to a halt. Your enzymes don’t get the messages they need to

<!-- chunk -->

### perform their critical functions. Of course, this isn’t an all-or-nothing situation.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s not as though you either have nutrients or you don’t. You have differing

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of nutrients and different enzymes that respond differently than other

<!-- chunk -->

### people’s enzymes do to these nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why making sure you have the right amount of nutrients for you is

<!-- chunk -->

### so important. And one of the easiest ways to do that is by taking vitamins and

<!-- chunk -->

### minerals. Vitamins and minerals are the cofactors (or coenzymes) that make

<!-- chunk -->

### things runs smoothly. Vitamins and minerals help your enzymes do what they

<!-- chunk -->

### were intended to do.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is for this reason that using a single baseline like the DRI to determine

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone’s nutritional needs no longer makes sense. The overwhelming evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### that now exists indicates that giving more than the minimum amount of nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary to avoid deficiency diseases may be critical to healing disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bruce Ames, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, at the

<!-- chunk -->

### University of California, Berkeley, in his landmark review of over fifty enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled by nutrients that vary genetically from person to person, states that:

<!-- chunk -->

### “Our analysis of metabolic disease that affects cofactor binding [the joining of

<!-- chunk -->

### the vitamin or nutrient to the enzyme], particularly as a result of polymorphic

<!-- chunk -->

### mutations [person-to-person genetic variations], may present a novel rationale

<!-- chunk -->

### for high-dose vitamin therapy, perhaps hundreds of times the normal dietary

<!-- chunk -->

### reference intakes (DRI) in some cases.”


<!-- chunk -->

### This means that genetically some of us may require much higher (and even

<!-- chunk -->

### mega) doses of certain vitamins for our enzymes and cells just to function

<!-- chunk -->

### normally. In fact, many of us are born with needs that may be two to one

<!-- chunk -->

### hundred times higher than someone else’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Few Vitamins and Minerals, Many Jobs

<!-- chunk -->

### Also absent from our current nutritional recommendations is the notion that

<!-- chunk -->

### each vitamin and mineral has many—and sometimes hundreds—of functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### The body uses the same nutrients for many different jobs. A single nutrient may

<!-- chunk -->

### catalyze hundreds of biochemical reactions and suboptimal levels may lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular and molecular dysfunction that is not recognized as a “deficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### disease,” yet still has a dramatic impact on our health.


<!-- chunk -->

### For example, just a little vitamin D

30;31

<!-- chunk -->

### prevents rickets, but a higher dose

<!-- chunk -->

### may have a role in treating or preventing heart disease, osteoporosis,

<!-- chunk -->

### tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy, type 1 diabetes, and cancer. Folate not only prevents dementia, but also

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, colon and breast cancer, birth defects, Down syndrome, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium plays a role in over three hundred enzyme reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s only three vitamins and minerals! Imagine the havoc suboptimal

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of many or all of the nutrients I listed on pages 118–19 might wreak on

<!-- chunk -->

### your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Robert Heaney, M.D., professor of medicine at Creighton

<!-- chunk -->

### University,


<!-- chunk -->

### admonishes us that this view overlooks two important facts.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, living for a long time with suboptimal levels of nutrients may cause

<!-- chunk -->

### similar but more subtle effects as the regular deficiency diseases. For example,

<!-- chunk -->

### having soft, tender bones may result from low-grade vitamin D deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Though this wouldn’t be defined as rickets, the effects are similar.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, there may also be very different mechanisms for developing

<!-- chunk -->

### disease after many years of low-grade deficiency because nutrients are involved

<!-- chunk -->

### in so many body functions. That is how suboptimal levels of folate can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer, heart disease, depression, or dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line: we need nutrients, they are essential, and without them our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies and our brains don’t function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now that we have established the critical role of nutrients as the building

<!-- chunk -->

### blocks of life, let’s look more closely at the ones that are the most important for

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain and mind.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Mighty Methylators for Mental Health: Folate, B

<!-- chunk -->

## 6

<!-- chunk -->

## , and B

<!-- chunk -->

## 12

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have ever seen a map of the New York subway system you know it is

<!-- chunk -->

### an incredibly complex interconnected set of train tracks. Imagine what would

<!-- chunk -->

### happen if there were a break in those tracks. Worse, imagine what would happen

<!-- chunk -->

### if there were a break in the tracks at Penn Station or Grand Central Terminal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the interconnected networks of trains would slow or shut down.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have ever seen a map of the biochemical pathways of a human being

<!-- chunk -->

### you know that it is thousands of times more complex than the New York subway.

<!-- chunk -->

### This map would fill an entire wall, and the words would be so small you could

<!-- chunk -->

### barely read them.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most important set of biochemical pathways in your body, perhaps the

<!-- chunk -->

### central switching station for the whole operation, are the “train tracks”

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for keeping two specific trains (or biochemical processes) running

<!-- chunk -->

### smoothly. They are the “methylation” train and the “sulfation” train.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many critical steps of our biology depend on these trains running smoothly

<!-- chunk -->

### and constantly. A break in the tracks on which these critical, interconnected

<!-- chunk -->

### processes depend causes many illnesses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with methylation and sulfation are involved in all mental illness

<!-- chunk -->

### and neurological dysfunction, especially depression, autism, attention deficit

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and more. They are also responsible for heart

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a few processes so central to health and biology that they explain

<!-- chunk -->

### much of what goes wrong with our brains, and how disease is created in general.

<!-- chunk -->

### Methylation and sulfation are two such processes. Think of these as natural laws

<!-- chunk -->

### —like the laws of physics—that explain all the phenomena we see with a few

<!-- chunk -->

### basic principles. Think of these interconnected biochemical pathways as part of

<!-- chunk -->

### the basic laws of biology.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, breaks in the methylation and sulfation tracks are the deep roots of

<!-- chunk -->

### nearly all illness and can explain what goes wrong in nearly all the other keys of

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Why Are “Methylation” and “Sulfation” So Important?

<!-- chunk -->

### Every important function in our bodies is regulated by or depends on these

<!-- chunk -->

### simple processes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our genes and our nutritional state control whether the methylation and

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfation trains run slowly or quickly, and whether or not they are likely to run

<!-- chunk -->

### off the tracks. Good genes and good nutrition lead to on-time express trains. Bad

<!-- chunk -->

### genes, poor diet, and toxins lead to train wrecks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that these processes can be almost completely fixed

<!-- chunk -->

### through diet, detoxification, and special nutritional supplements, even if you

<!-- chunk -->

### have “bad” genes.

<!-- chunk -->

### For methylation and sulfation to stay on track, your body needs a daily

<!-- chunk -->

### source of three special vitamins—B

12 ,


6 ,

<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate—to help keep the process

<!-- chunk -->

### of methylation running.

<!-- chunk -->

### Beside B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate the body also needs a continual source of sulfur

<!-- chunk -->

### for the sulfation train specifically. This comes from foods like broccoli and garlic

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as fish, eggs, sunflower seeds, and poultry, which are high in methionine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and can be boosted by special nutrients such as NAC (n-acetylcysteine) and

<!-- chunk -->

### alpha lipoic acid and an herb like milk thistle.

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 9: Methylation cycle (control of DNA, creation of cell membrane, and

<!-- chunk -->

### production of cellular energy), detoxification, and antioxidant protection

<!-- chunk -->

### A lack of these important nutrients is what causes the methylation and

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfation trains to break down. The tracks break, and the trains grind to a halt.

<!-- chunk -->

### And that prevents your brain from functioning the way it was designed, leading

<!-- chunk -->

### to depression, autism, ADHD, dementia, and almost all variations of broken

<!-- chunk -->

### brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because sulfation is a critical part of detoxification, I will focus on that

<!-- chunk -->

### process more in chapter 10. For now, let’s look more closely at methylation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have problems with methylation? Take the following quiz to find

<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key—Methylation*


<!-- chunk -->

## Why the Methylation Train Needs to Run on Time

<!-- chunk -->

### Almost every mental disorder and neurodegenerative disease from

<!-- chunk -->

### depression to Alzheimer’s,


<!-- chunk -->

### from ADHD to autism,


<!-- chunk -->

### from Parkinson’s


<!-- chunk -->

### to

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disease


<!-- chunk -->

### can be improved by fixing problems with methylation and

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfation trains. It is one of the most exciting areas of research in medicine today.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fixing these biochemical trains also prevents heart disease, osteoporosis,

<!-- chunk -->

### strokes, cancer, Down syndrome, spina bifida, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

## Methylation is the center of our biochemistry and brain function

<!-- chunk -->

## because it:

<!-- chunk -->

### Keeps Our DNA Working

<!-- chunk -->

### Protects our DNA: it repairs damaged DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Switches DNA on and off at the right time to keep us healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Helps Neurotransmitters Work

<!-- chunk -->

### It is necessary for the production and removal of neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine to keep things in

<!-- chunk -->

### balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps the receptors on cells get ready to receive messages from

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### It makes cell membranes more fluid, and less stiff and more receptive to

<!-- chunk -->

### brain messenger chemicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps produce PC, the major fatty fluid component of cell membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Is the Major Antioxidant System

<!-- chunk -->

### It lowers homocysteine (an unhealthy compound that can damage blood

<!-- chunk -->

### vessels and brain cells through oxidation).

<!-- chunk -->

### It is critical in controlling oxidative stress or the rusting process common

<!-- chunk -->

### to almost every disease through the production of glutathione (see page

<!-- chunk -->

### 238)

<!-- chunk -->

### Is the Key to Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps recycle molecules needed for detoxification (namely, the body’s

<!-- chunk -->

### major detoxifier, or glutathione—see page 238).

<!-- chunk -->

### Cools Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### It controls and reduces inflammation by producing glutathione and

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing oxidative stress (which triggers inflammation).

<!-- chunk -->

### Is the Link to All Chronic Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### It prevents dementia, cancer, heart disease, and almost every known age-

<!-- chunk -->

### related disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s easy to see why breaks in the tracks on which the methylation train runs

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to many of the mental and physical health problems people suffer with

<!-- chunk -->

### every day. Let’s look at some of the research on how this process is linked to so

<!-- chunk -->

### many mental illnesses and brain disorders specifically. This is only the tip of the

<!-- chunk -->

### iceberg, but it gives you a sense of how huge this problem is.

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression and Mood Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### Overwhelming evidence links low folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### levels to depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood disorders. Deficiency or insufficiency of these vitamins is very

<!-- chunk -->

### common. And remember, it is these deficiencies that cause the methylation train

<!-- chunk -->

### to slow down. These special nutrients keep the enzymes going that run the

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation train.

<!-- chunk -->

### Victor Herbert first discovered the consequences of this deficiency in

<!-- chunk -->

### 1962.


<!-- chunk -->

### He used himself as a study subject, consumed a folate-deficient diet for

<!-- chunk -->

### four and a half months, and experienced progressive insomnia, forgetfulness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability. All these symptoms disappeared within two days of taking folate. In

<!-- chunk -->

### another study of 2,682 middle-aged men in Finland,


<!-- chunk -->

### those with the lowest

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary folate intake had a 67 percent greater risk of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### One remarkable study in the American Journal of Psychiatry


<!-- chunk -->

### found that

<!-- chunk -->

### 27 percent of severely depressed women over sixty-five years old were


<!-- chunk -->

### deficient. This was found not by blood levels of B


<!-- chunk -->

### , but by the functional

<!-- chunk -->

### indicator of whether B


<!-- chunk -->

### was doing its job—methylmalonic acid. If you think

<!-- chunk -->

### about it, this suggests that more than one-quarter of all severe depression can be

<!-- chunk -->

### cured with B


<!-- chunk -->

### shots!

<!-- chunk -->

### Doctors are now using a “prescription” folate called Deplin to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and to improve the effectiveness of antidepressants.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, if you

<!-- chunk -->

### have folate deficiency, it is unlikely that antidepressants will even work.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s remarkable is how backward the thinking about depression is.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doctors tend to only use vitamins if the antidepressants don’t work.


<!-- chunk -->

### They

<!-- chunk -->

### should be prescribing the vitamins in the first place and then supplementing with

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants only if vitamins and lifestyle changes don’t work.

<!-- chunk -->

### People with a low folate level have only a 7 percent response to treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### with antidepressants. Those with a high folate have a response rate of 44 percent.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s six times better. In medicine, if we get a 15 to 30 percent improvement we

<!-- chunk -->

### are happy; but a 600 percent improvement should be headline news.

<!-- chunk -->

### Supplementing with methylation vitamins is part of the miracle cure that

<!-- chunk -->

### turned lifelong depression around for my patient Joe.

<!-- chunk -->

### No matter what he did Joe could not get out from under his dark cloud of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. He came to see me at fifty-one years old, after a parade of

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatrists and psychiatric medication for bipolar disease—mood stabilizers

<!-- chunk -->

### like Lithium, Depakote, and Abilify; antipsychotics like Zyprexa and Clozaril;

<!-- chunk -->

### antiseizure medication like Lamictal and Neurontin, and stimulants like Provigil,

<!-- chunk -->

### Adderall, and Ritalin; and even Parkinson’s drugs like Requip to raise his

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even with a multidrug cocktail he couldn’t overcome his depression. He

<!-- chunk -->

### complained that his depression stole his life. Many days he could not get out of

<!-- chunk -->

### bed, go to work, or focus. He had no energy and needed daily naps. The

<!-- chunk -->

### depression also affected his marriage—he could not make plans or go out.

<!-- chunk -->

### The symptoms lasted for years and years and years. During the previous

<!-- chunk -->

### five years he had gained fifty pounds (often a side effect of the medication), and

<!-- chunk -->

### developed high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He could sleep only a few

<!-- chunk -->

### hours a night and had uncontrollable food cravings at night for bread, pasta,

<!-- chunk -->

### and sugar. He also had psoriasis and terrible stomach bloating after eating.

<!-- chunk -->

### After testing we found he had many, many things out of balance—his blood

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar, low testosterone levels, low levels of serotonin and dopamine, and dairy

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies. He hated fish and had very low omega-3 fats. But the most dramatic

<!-- chunk -->

### finding was severe B

12,

<!-- chunk -->

### folate, and B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. His methylation train was stuck.

<!-- chunk -->

### After cleaning up his diet, balancing his blood sugar and testosterone,

<!-- chunk -->

### giving him fish oil, and fixing his digestion, we gave him doses of folic acid, B

6 ,


<!-- chunk -->

### and B


<!-- chunk -->

### shots.

<!-- chunk -->

### Subsequently his sleep improved, he was able to work out with a trainer,

<!-- chunk -->

### and for the first time in a few decades, he felt his depression lift. And it did not

<!-- chunk -->

### return!

<!-- chunk -->

### After a year, he called me to thank me for giving him his life back. While he

<!-- chunk -->

### wasn’t able to get off all his medications, he was able to feel joy again, didn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### need any more naps, and lost thirty pounds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging found that 35 percent of people

<!-- chunk -->

### were deficient in folate and that the risk of getting Alzheimer’s was increased

<!-- chunk -->

### percent in those who were deficient in folate.


<!-- chunk -->

### In one double-blind, placebo-

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled study of elderly patients with memory complaints, giving 15 mg of

<!-- chunk -->

### folate a day showed significant improvements in memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### In another ten-year study in the American Journal of Clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrition,


<!-- chunk -->

### doctors found that in those over sixty-five years old, low-vitamin-B


<!-- chunk -->

### status was associated with more rapid cognitive decline.

<!-- chunk -->

### I see cases like this over and over again in my practice—get the

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation train running smoothly again and memory improves almost

<!-- chunk -->

### overnight. That is what happened for Eleanor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eleanor was a seventy-two-year-old patient of mine who noticed a

<!-- chunk -->

### progressive decline in her memory and mood and believed it was just normal

<!-- chunk -->

### aging. She couldn’t remember names well, would forget why she came into a

<!-- chunk -->

### room, and felt like she was slipping away.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also took acid-blocking medication for reflux, which prevents B


<!-- chunk -->

### absorption. Even with adequate dietary B


<!-- chunk -->

### we don’t absorb B


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as we

<!-- chunk -->

### age, so the medication turned a small problem into a big one. This led to a

<!-- chunk -->

### severe B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency, which not only made her lose her memory, but also led to

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing fatigue and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eleanor was way off the methylation tracks. Just giving her special B


<!-- chunk -->

### shots (methyl B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) and special forms of folate (5 MTHF) improved her mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and energy almost overnight.

<!-- chunk -->

## ADHD and Autism

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the most interesting studies regarding trouble with the methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### and sulfation trains come from the world of autism and ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Richard Deth of Northeastern University has discovered that the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors for dopamine, the neurotransmitter that is essential for focus and

<!-- chunk -->

### attention (two things notably lacking in ADHD and autism), require methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### to work properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, children with ADHD and autism tend to have slightly quirky

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine receptors that are easily disturbed by anything that messes up

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation.

<!-- chunk -->

### To be turned on, these dopamine receptors need vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### acting as a

<!-- chunk -->

### helper to specific enzymes. Unfortunately toxins, especially mercury, poison a

<!-- chunk -->

### particular enzyme (MS or methionine synthase). This can lead to a biochemical

<!-- chunk -->

### traffic jam.


<!-- chunk -->

### Getting the traffic flowing with methyl B


<!-- chunk -->

### often has miraculous effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### these children. The special form of B


<!-- chunk -->

### helps synchronize neuronal or brain

<!-- chunk -->

### activity. In one of my autistic patients, the school knows exactly which day he

<!-- chunk -->

### gets his B


<!-- chunk -->

### shots: he is focused, happy, and engaged.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wow! That’s a rather long list of problems that are caused by improper

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation. So let’s take a look at what causes the methylation and sulfation

<!-- chunk -->

### trains to come off the tracks. That will lead us to better understand how we can

<!-- chunk -->

### repair the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Causes the Train Wrecks?

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, many things can affect optimal methylation and sulfation. But

<!-- chunk -->

### it can be boiled down to two main issues—your genes and your environment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Genes load the metabolic gun and the environment pulls the trigger. And

<!-- chunk -->

### often a combination of genes sets the stage for problems. There is no one gene

<!-- chunk -->

### for Alzheimer’s or autism—there are multiple genes that interact with a complex

<!-- chunk -->

### and often toxic environment.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s how the gun gets loaded.

<!-- chunk -->

### But whether we pull the trigger or not is largely dependent on us. You may

<!-- chunk -->

### have genetic predispositions to certain diseases, but that doesn’t mean you have

<!-- chunk -->

### to get sick.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Makes Us Sick: Our Nutrient-Poor, SAD Diet and Toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### Our toxic, nutrient-poor “dietary” environment undersupplies the raw

<!-- chunk -->

### materials for proper biochemical and metabolic functioning, namely nutrients,

<!-- chunk -->

### and oversupplies a load of chemicals, additives, pollutants, and allergens. This

<!-- chunk -->

### sends the train right off the tracks.

<!-- chunk -->

### The single biggest environmental influence you can control is what you eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, food is not just calories; it is information. It tells our genes what to

<!-- chunk -->

### do.

<!-- chunk -->

### You see, the real cause of the epidemics of mental and physical illness in

<!-- chunk -->

### this country is our SAD diet—the Standard American Diet—which is nutrient-

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient and packed with chemicals that poison our bodies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember the only reason we need to “enrich” our food with nutrients is

<!-- chunk -->

### that it’s “impoverished” in the first place.


<!-- chunk -->

### It is grown in nutrient-depleted

<!-- chunk -->

### soils,


<!-- chunk -->

### artificially supported with petrochemical fertilizers, protected by

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides and herbicides, and is genetically designed to fit in boxes, be

<!-- chunk -->

### transported over long distances, and stay “fresh” for a long time.


<!-- chunk -->

### The highly processed, nutrient-poor foods that are sold to us do exactly the

<!-- chunk -->

### opposite of enriching us. They turn off the right genes, turn on the wrong ones,

<!-- chunk -->

### and send your system into chaos.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are literally a trigger for the loaded gun.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Environmental Factors Interfere with Methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other things that interfere with methylation in the body

<!-- chunk -->

### besides our SAD diet. Excess animal protein, sugar, saturated fat, coffee,

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol, milk allergy, zinc deficiency, irradiation of food, the measles virus,

<!-- chunk -->

### smoking, poor digestion, certain medications (acid blockers, contraceptives,

<!-- chunk -->

### diuretics), and environmental toxins—especially mercury and organophosphate

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides—all interfere with normal methylation and/or disrupt normal vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### status.

<!-- chunk -->

## Keeping the Trains Running

<!-- chunk -->

### Whew! That was like going to medical school! But now you know some

<!-- chunk -->

### critical things to help your mood, behavior, memory, and attention (as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### almost all chronic disease), which are connected to these twin trains of

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation and sulfation.

<!-- chunk -->

### You also learned that genes set the stage for trouble, and that a poor diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental toxins push you into a biochemical train wreck, which you

<!-- chunk -->

### experience as ADHD, depression, bipolar disease, autism, dementia, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic illnesses.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that we now know how to fix these breaks in the tracks,

<!-- chunk -->

### and correct the collateral damage known as “disease” with a few simple tricks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clean up your diet, get rid of toxins, and take a few supplements. That’s it!

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D: D for Depression and Dementia

## Scoring Key—Vitamin D *


<!-- chunk -->

### What vitamin deficiency affects over half of the population, is almost never

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed, and has been linked to depression, dementia, many cancers,

<!-- chunk -->

### autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia, high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, heart disease, diabetes, chronic muscle pain, and bone loss?

<!-- chunk -->

### What vitamin is almost totally absent from our food supply? What vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### do we need up to twenty-five times more of than the government recommends

<!-- chunk -->

### for us to be healthy? What vitamin is the hidden cause of so much suffering that

<!-- chunk -->

### is so easy to treat?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you guessed vitamin D, you are correct.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the last fifteen years of my practice, my focus has been to discover

<!-- chunk -->

### what the body needs to function optimally. And I have become more interested

<!-- chunk -->

### in the role of specific nutrients as the years have passed. In the past five years I

<!-- chunk -->

### have tested almost every patient in my practice for vitamin D deficiency, and I

<!-- chunk -->

### am shocked by what I see. I am also amazed by what happens when their

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin D status reaches an optimal level.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each nutrient has its role, but vitamin D deficiency is a major epidemic that

<!-- chunk -->

### is under the radar of most doctors and public health officials. It has been linked

<!-- chunk -->

### to depression, dementia, an increased risk of death, and even autism. Consider

<!-- chunk -->

### the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study of elderly patients the average level of vitamin D was

<!-- chunk -->

### ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter) when normal is between 50 and 80.

<!-- chunk -->

### Almost 60 percent of them were under 20 ng/ml. Those with the lowest

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin D levels had the most depression and the worst performance on

<!-- chunk -->

### objective tests for dementia and cognitive function.


<!-- chunk -->

### We know that vitamin D levels drop precipitously in winter, that this is

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with seasonal affective disorder, and that giving vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements can prevent this.


<!-- chunk -->

### New insights into brain development in the womb link vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency with autism. Vitamin D is necessary for the normal

<!-- chunk -->

### development of the brain and reduces brain inflammation that is

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic in autism.


<!-- chunk -->

### A review in the The Archives of Internal Medicine of all randomized trials

<!-- chunk -->

### on vitamin D supplementation found a reduction in death of 7 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### from all causes.


<!-- chunk -->

### This should have been headline news, and would have

<!-- chunk -->

### been if it was a drug.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most doctors think that if you don’t have rickets you don’t have vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. They couldn’t be more wrong. The real question is not how little we

<!-- chunk -->

### need not to get rickets (400 IU a day), but how much we need to be optimally

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy and how much we were designed to have (approximately 5,000 to

<!-- chunk -->

### 10,000 IU a day).

<!-- chunk -->

### We are not living in the environment in which we were designed to thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### People who live in northern climates no longer eat a diet of fatty wild fish like

<!-- chunk -->

### mackerel and herring and cod liver oil—which are among the few natural dietary

<!-- chunk -->

### sources of vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the rest of us, the key is sunlight. Most of us live and work indoors, but

<!-- chunk -->

### 80 to 100 percent of our vitamin D requirement comes from our exposure to

<!-- chunk -->

### sunlight. And concerns about skin cancer encourage use of sunblock, which

<!-- chunk -->

### stops 97 percent of the skin’s production of vitamin D. Use of sunscreen, dark

<!-- chunk -->

### skin color, increase in latitude, changes in seasonal sun exposure, aging, and

<!-- chunk -->

### wearing clothes that cover most of our body all affect our risk of vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Newer research by Dr. Michael Holick,


<!-- chunk -->

### a vitamin D pioneer and professor

<!-- chunk -->

### of medicine, physiology, and dermatology at Boston University School of

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicine, recommends intakes of up to 2,000 IU a day,


<!-- chunk -->

### or enough to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### blood levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D at between 40 to 60 ng/ml. Lifeguards

<!-- chunk -->

### have levels of over 100 ng/ml without toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### So supplementation is essential unless we are spending all our time at the

<!-- chunk -->

### beach, eating thirty ounces of wild salmon a day, or downing ten tablespoons of

<!-- chunk -->

### cod liver oil a day! The exact amount needed to get your blood levels to the

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal range (50 to 80 ng/ml) will vary depending on your age, genetics, how

<!-- chunk -->

### far north you live, how much time you spend in the sun, and even the time of the

<!-- chunk -->

### year.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are scared into thinking that high doses are toxic, but one study of

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy young men receiving 10,000 IU of vitamin D for twenty weeks showed

<!-- chunk -->

### no toxicity (I wouldn’t try that, though, without a doctor’s supervision).

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a story of one of my patients to show just how powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with vitamin D can be.

<!-- chunk -->

### Norah, a fifty-two-year-old woman, worked and lived in Boston. She spent

<!-- chunk -->

### her time as a software programmer in the basement of an old building. Every

<!-- chunk -->

### winter she would sink into a deep, dark slump. She dreaded the shortening of the

<!-- chunk -->

### days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like most women, she kept out of the sun to prevent skin cancer and

<!-- chunk -->

### wrinkles and always wore sunblock and a hat when out in the sun.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also found her muscles ached worse in the winter, and her doctor told

<!-- chunk -->

### her that she had osteoporosis. She was told she had seasonal affective disorder—

<!-- chunk -->

### which just meant she was getting depressed in the winter!

<!-- chunk -->

### We found she had extremely low vitamin D levels. By giving her high doses

<!-- chunk -->

### over a few months we were able to get her vitamin D up to normal—and with

<!-- chunk -->

### that her depression lifted and her achy muscles resolved.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mental Minerals: Essential Ingredients for the Nervous System

<!-- chunk -->

### More than eighteen minerals are essential for human nutrition. They work in

<!-- chunk -->

### similar ways to vitamins, as helpers for the body’s enzymes. They are needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### make our bones (calcium) and our blood cells (iron) and for our nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### While all are important, there are a few that are key players in optimal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function: magnesium, zinc, and selenium.

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium: The Relaxation Mineral

## Scoring Key—Magnesium*

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are deficient in this critical nutrient you are twice as likely to die.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is reported from a study of hospitalized patients in the Journal of Intensive

<!-- chunk -->

### Care Medicine.


<!-- chunk -->

### Up to half of Americans are deficient in this nutrient and don’t know it.

<!-- chunk -->

### And normal blood tests may miss it.

<!-- chunk -->

### It accounts for a long list of symptoms and diseases, which are easily

<!-- chunk -->

### helped and often cured by adding this nutrient.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, in my practice, this nutrient is one of my secret weapons against

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, particularly anxiety, insomnia, ADHD, and autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is it?

<!-- chunk -->

### It is magnesium. It is the stress antidote and the most powerful relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

### mineral that exists.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now I find it very funny that more doctors aren’t clued into this nutrient

<!-- chunk -->

### because we use it all the time in conventional medicine but never stop to think

<!-- chunk -->

### about why or how important it is to our general health or why it helps our body

<!-- chunk -->

### function better.

<!-- chunk -->

### I remember using it when I worked in the emergency room. It was a critical

<!-- chunk -->

### “medication” on the crash cart. If someone was dying of a life-threatening

<!-- chunk -->

### arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat), we used intravenous magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### If someone was constipated or needed to prepare for a colonoscopy, we

<!-- chunk -->

### gave them milk of magnesia or a green bottle of liquid magnesium citrate, which

<!-- chunk -->

### emptied their bowels.

<!-- chunk -->

### But you don’t have to be in the hospital to benefit from treating magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. You can treat yourself now, and chances are you are deficient,

<!-- chunk -->

### because as I said above, up to half of all Americans don’t get enough

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of magnesium as the relaxation mineral. Anything that is tight,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritable, crampy, stiff—whether it is a body part or even a mood—is a sign of

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium deficiency. If you suffer these kinds of symptoms it’s likely you

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t get enough magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### This critical mineral is responsible for more than three hundred enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions in the body and is found in all your tissues, but mainly in your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### bones, and muscles. It is necessary for your cells to make energy, for many

<!-- chunk -->

### different chemical pumps to work, to stabilize membranes, and to help muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### relax.

<!-- chunk -->

### The list of conditions that are related to magnesium deficiency is very long.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are more than 3,500 medical references on magnesium deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it is mostly ignored because it is not a drug, even though it is more

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful in many cases than drugs, which is why we use it in life-threatening

<!-- chunk -->

### and emergency situations like seizures and heart failure in the hospital.

<!-- chunk -->

### You might be suffering from magnesium deficiency if you experience any

<!-- chunk -->

### of the following things:

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety, autism, ADHD, headaches, migraines, chronic fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability, muscle cramps or twitches, insomnia, sensitivity to loud

<!-- chunk -->

### noises, palpitations, angina, constipation, anal spasms, fibromyalgia,

<!-- chunk -->

### asthma, kidney stones, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, PMS, menstrual cramps, irritable bladder, irritable bowel

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome, reflux, trouble swallowing, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### We eat a diet that has practically no magnesium—a highly processed,

<!-- chunk -->

### refined diet that is based mostly on white flour, meat, and dairy, none of which

<!-- chunk -->

### contain magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are under chronic stress and this also decreases our magnesium levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, one study in Kosovo found that those under chronic war stress lost large

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts of magnesium in their urine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium levels are also decreased by excess alcohol, salt, coffee, sugar,

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphoric acid in colas, profuse sweating, chronic diarrhea, excessive

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruation, diuretics (water pills), antibiotics, other drugs, and some intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### parasites.

<!-- chunk -->

### We live lifestyles that cause us to lose whatever magnesium we have in our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies, and we never replace it.

<!-- chunk -->

### When was the last time you had a good dose of sea vegetables (seaweed),

<!-- chunk -->

### nuts, greens, and beans? If you are like most Americans, your nut consumption

<!-- chunk -->

### mostly comes from peanut butter, and mostly in chocolate peanut butter cups. As

<!-- chunk -->

### for seaweed, greens, and beans ... well, most Americans don’t eat much of these

<!-- chunk -->

### at all.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you suffer from any of the symptoms I mentioned or have any of the

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases I noted—it is an easy fix!

<!-- chunk -->

### But how do you fix it? Simply increase beans, greens, and seaweed in your

<!-- chunk -->

### diet. Get rid of the magnesium suckers like stress, coffee, alcohol, and sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

### And take an extra magnesium supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, follow the UltraMind Solution. (I will explain how you can

<!-- chunk -->

### do it in more detail in Part III.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium supplementation had magnificent effects on my patient Mary.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me tell you her story.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of my patients are doctors—and usually they have run the gamut of

<!-- chunk -->

### specialists and experts to find a solution to their ills. Mary, a thirty-six-year-old

<!-- chunk -->

### physician, was no exception.

<!-- chunk -->

### For years she suffered intractable migraines, finding only marginal relief in

<!-- chunk -->

### the strongest narcotic pain medication and antinausea pills. She had been to

<!-- chunk -->

### every headache clinic and tried every medication to prevent or treat her

<!-- chunk -->

### migraines without any relief. After listening to her story, the solution was

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious to me...

<!-- chunk -->

### Besides the migraines, she suffered from panic attacks, anxiety, insomnia,

<!-- chunk -->

### and palpitations, as well as muscle cramps and severe constipation—she went to

<!-- chunk -->

### the bathroom only once a week.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every symptom she had pointed to everything in her body being tight or

<!-- chunk -->

### twitchy—tight emotions, tight head, twitchy heart, tight muscles, really tight

<!-- chunk -->

### bowels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mary was so depleted in magnesium she needed nearly ten times the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount I usually give people. Once her levels normalized we reduced the dose,

<!-- chunk -->

### and within days her anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, muscle cramps,

<!-- chunk -->

### constipation, and, most important, the migraines she had for years were gone.

<!-- chunk -->

## Minerals and the Brain: Zinc and Selenium

<!-- chunk -->

### We, of course, need all the essential minerals. That’s why they call them

<!-- chunk -->

### essential!

<!-- chunk -->

### We have already talked about the most important one—magnesium. But a

<!-- chunk -->

### few more stand out as critical for brain function and health. Zinc and selenium

<!-- chunk -->

### are specifically important for your brain, so we need to review them before we

<!-- chunk -->

### close.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc


# ZINC QUIZ*

<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key—Zinc*


<!-- chunk -->

### We are in a global zinc deficiency epidemic. More than one third of the

<!-- chunk -->

### world’s population is zinc-deficient and in some populations up to 73 percent are

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is a huge problem because zinc is used by more enzymes (over

<!-- chunk -->

### three hundred) than any other mineral, including those that help your DNA

<!-- chunk -->

### repair, replicate, and synthesize proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think back to the beginning of this chapter to understand why that’s so

<!-- chunk -->

### important. Your DNA’s job is to build protein. If that stops, your system breaks

<!-- chunk -->

### down from its roots.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is important in immunity and controlling inflammation, a critical

<!-- chunk -->

### factor in brain dysfunction. It is also extremely important for activating your

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive enzymes; this helps you break down and digest food better and aids in

<!-- chunk -->

### preventing food allergies—one of the chief causes of inflammation (and

<!-- chunk -->

### consequently brain diseases in so many). I will discuss the critical importance of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation in brain health in chapter 8.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc also helps rid the body of heavy metal toxins like mercury by helping

<!-- chunk -->

### a key enzyme called metallothionein. Problems with metallothionein have been

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to many neurobehavioral problems, including ADHD and autism. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### the highest concentration of metallothionein is in the brain, especially in the

<!-- chunk -->

### memory center, or hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low zinc levels have been linked to depression


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, learning, mental function, and susceptibility to convulsions. Zinc is

<!-- chunk -->

### also needed for the enzyme dopamine hydroxylase that makes the happy

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone noradrenaline from dopamine. This is, perhaps, one of the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons zinc deficiency is associated with depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### There have also been links between zinc deficiency and schizophrenia. It

<!-- chunk -->

### seems that up to 50 percent of schizophrenics have a biochemical quirk called

<!-- chunk -->

### the mauve factor (a chemical by-product from oxidation injury to our fats and

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins).


<!-- chunk -->

### These odd compounds can bind to zinc and vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , leading to a

<!-- chunk -->

### functional zinc deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of my patients told me the story of her schizophrenic brother who

<!-- chunk -->

### woke up from his madness by simply taking high doses of zinc, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and niacin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Abram Hoffer, the father of orthomolecular psychiatry, has successfully

<!-- chunk -->

### treated thousands of schizophrenic patients using this approach.


<!-- chunk -->

### An extensive

<!-- chunk -->

### review of the mauve factor in many diseases by Woody McGinnis


<!-- chunk -->

### and his

<!-- chunk -->

### group documents how the neurotoxin influences mood, brain, and behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mauve factor can be measured in the urine. Taking zinc, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and niacin can

<!-- chunk -->

### correct this problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Low zinc also affects taste and appetite and is linked to eating disorders. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you can’t taste your food, you either become anorexic or you overeat!

<!-- chunk -->

### Adequate zinc is absolutely critical for a healthy brain and body. And many

<!-- chunk -->

### of us are deficient and don’t know it. So eat pumpkin seeds and take zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

## Selenium

<!-- chunk -->

### Selenium is worth mentioning when it comes to the health of the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood because it functions in a number of key systems in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### It helps you make thyroid hormone, so necessary for proper mood and brain


<!-- chunk -->

### It helps your body make more glutathione, and supports your body’s main

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification and antioxidant system. (We will discuss this more in chapter 10.)

<!-- chunk -->

### And it is important in helping your body make some of the essential fatty

<!-- chunk -->

### acids which we know have a huge impact on mood, autism, ADHD, dementia,

<!-- chunk -->

### and just about everything else to do with the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### No wonder studies have found that selenium supplementation boosts

<!-- chunk -->

### mood!


<!-- chunk -->

## Optimize Your Nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

### This journey through the world of nutrients and the brain is just a glimpse of

<!-- chunk -->

### the astounding world of scientific literature on this subject. I have highlighted

<!-- chunk -->

### just a few of the most important considerations and the implications for

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of our epidemic of mental and brain disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### By using this approach, we go to the roots of the problem. We focus on how

<!-- chunk -->

### the body works, why it breaks down, and how to fix it using some very simple

<!-- chunk -->

### principles.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you move toward UltraWellness and an UltraMind, remember what we

<!-- chunk -->

### learned in this chapter:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. You must have the essential fats—DHA, EPA, PC, and PS—for your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and every one of your 100 trillion cells to function well.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Amino acids are the building blocks of moods, thought, and memory—

<!-- chunk -->

### get them tuned up. They help produce all the neurotransmitters needed

<!-- chunk -->

### for optimal brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Carbohydrates from whole unprocessed plant foods full of

<!-- chunk -->

### phytonutrients, vitamins, minerals, and fiber are essential for your health

<!-- chunk -->

### and your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Keep the methylation and sulfation trains running with the right types

<!-- chunk -->

### and amounts of folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and sources of sulfur in the diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements. (See chapter 10 for more information about the sulfation

<!-- chunk -->

### train specifically.)

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Most of us have a vitamin D deficiency. Getting enough on board will

<!-- chunk -->

### help your brain and prevent many diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Magnesium is the major relaxation mineral.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. Zinc and selenium are absolutely critical for a happy, healthy brain and


<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrition is of fundamental importance. It is the foundation on which your

<!-- chunk -->

### body runs, the source for all the raw materials you need to thrive. What you have

<!-- chunk -->

### learned in this chapter should form the basis for a whole new understanding of

<!-- chunk -->

### how your mind and your body function.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this is still only one of the keys to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now let’s look at how hormonal imbalances affect your thoughts, mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory, and behavior.


# KEY #2: BALANCE YOUR HORMONES


<!-- chunk -->

### Many of us are living a life out of balance but don’t recognize it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you feel your life is a song played badly out of tune?

<!-- chunk -->

### Does your mood and energy swing up and down, making your life crazy?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you crave sugar or salt?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are you overweight and putting on more and more belly fat?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are a woman, do you have premenstrual syndrome or painful or

<!-- chunk -->

### heavy periods?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are you depressed?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you sleep poorly?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are you less interested in sex?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have thinning hair, dry skin; do you feel sluggish in the

<!-- chunk -->

### mornings?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you feel tired but wired?

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have to live on coffee in the morning and a few glasses of wine at

<!-- chunk -->

### night just to wake up, and then calm down every day?

<!-- chunk -->

### If you do, you are not alone. In fact, this is how most Americans feel,

<!-- chunk -->

### because we are living out of harmony with our natural biological rhythms. Small

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules in our body that we depend on to keep us in balance are running

<!-- chunk -->

### haywire.

<!-- chunk -->

### These messenger molecules are involved in almost every function of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body in one way or another, and they are critical to our well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three main communications systems in your body. They direct all

<!-- chunk -->

### the traffic and messages from your nervous system (including the gut, the site of

<!-- chunk -->

### your second brain), your endocrine or hormonal system, and your immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system. Each of these systems is part of a larger integrated system called the

<!-- chunk -->

### “psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune” system, or PNEI.

<!-- chunk -->

### The three main communication systems are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Neurotransmitters—Messengers of the Nervous System (The most

<!-- chunk -->

### important are dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA,

<!-- chunk -->

### and acetylcholine. I discussed these in chapter 6.)

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Hormones—Messengers of the Endocrine System (This chapter will

<!-- chunk -->

### focus on these important molecules.)

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Cytokines—Messengers of the Immune System (I will discuss these in

<!-- chunk -->

### the next chapter, when we talk about inflammation.)

<!-- chunk -->

### All of your hormones and your brain and immune messenger chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### work together in a symphony. Understand how and why these three systems get

<!-- chunk -->

### out of balance and you will go a long way toward understanding why Americans

<!-- chunk -->

### run around tired, depressed, stressed, forgetful, unfocused, and overweight!

<!-- chunk -->

### In this chapter, we will focus specifically on hormones. To adequately

<!-- chunk -->

### explore the role of hormones in your mood and brain function would require a

<!-- chunk -->

### textbook. Here, I want to give you a road map that will help you understand how

<!-- chunk -->

### key hormones play a role in your health, why they get out of balance, and how to

<!-- chunk -->

### get them back in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Command and Control Center for Your Whole Body

<!-- chunk -->

### Health is good communication. All your cells talk to each other. They do so

<!-- chunk -->

### through many different messengers and “languages.” There is the endocrine

<!-- chunk -->

### language, or hormones; the immune language, or cytokines (see page 175 for

<!-- chunk -->

### more on these); and the nervous system language, or neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your hormones are produced and controlled by your endocrine glands. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the conductors or the command and control centers for all your endocrine glands

<!-- chunk -->

### happen to be located in your brain. They are the hypothalamus and the pituitary

<!-- chunk -->

### gland.

<!-- chunk -->

### These glands send signals to distant parts of the body to control:

<!-- chunk -->

### Your stress response through your adrenal glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your blood-sugar balance through your pancreas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your thyroid hormone via your thyroid gland.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your sexual behavior, which functions through your reproductive organs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your growth, sleep, mood, and much more.

<!-- chunk -->

### This network of glands (the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, adrenal,

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, ovaries, and testes) both send and receive

<!-- chunk -->

### messages in a finely orchestrated symphony and have their effects through the

<!-- chunk -->

### whole body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 10: The hormone system: bidirectional communication between your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and your endocrine glands

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three big epidemics of hormonal problems in America today—too

<!-- chunk -->

### much insulin (from sugar), too much cortisol and adrenalin (from stress), and

<!-- chunk -->

### not enough thyroid hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### These all interconnect with and affect the other major category of hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### —our sex hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imbalances or disturbances in any one of these interconnected systems can

<!-- chunk -->

### influence the way our brain functions and lead to everything from depression to

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, from anxiety to ADHD, and, of course, are linked to the other major

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemic we face in the twenty-first century—overweight and obesity.

<!-- chunk -->

### For now we will look at the role that insulin, thyroid, and sex hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### play in your mood and brain function. We will also briefly look at the role of

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin and growth hormone, which are also important. We will leave cortisol

<!-- chunk -->

### and DHEA to chapter 12, because they are intertwined with stress and your

<!-- chunk -->

### experience of the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you focus on just these few—insulin, thyroid, sex hormones, melatonin,

<!-- chunk -->

### growth hormone, and cortisol (the stress hormone)—all the rest come into

<!-- chunk -->

### balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Don’t Panic, It’s Just Your Blood Sugar : Insulin and Your

<!-- chunk -->

## Brain

## Scoring Key—Insulin


<!-- chunk -->

### If you want to be depressed, tired, anxious, hyperactive but unfocused, and

<!-- chunk -->

### lose your memory, not to mention pack on belly fat, clog your arteries, fuel

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer cells, and get dementia, then keep eating the way you do (if you are one

<!-- chunk -->

### of the average Americans who eats 158 pounds of sugar a year).

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar promotes high levels of insulin (I’ll tell you how in a moment). And

<!-- chunk -->

### too much insulin is the number-one cause of our chronic disease epidemic and a

<!-- chunk -->

### major unrecognized factor in mood disorders and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me tell you a story of a man who came to me. His story may be all too

<!-- chunk -->

### familiar to you ... but it can have a happy ending for you, as it did for him.

<!-- chunk -->

### James was a forty-six-year-old Wall Street executive who came to me for a

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiac stress test. He was a hard-driving, don’t-look-up type of guy who was

<!-- chunk -->

### convinced he was dying of heart disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every day, sometime in the late afternoon, he would experience the sudden

<!-- chunk -->

### onset of sweating, a racing heart, anxiety, and shortness of breath. In other

<!-- chunk -->

### words, he thought he was going to die!

<!-- chunk -->

### In reality, he was just having panic attacks—severe onsets of anxiety that

<!-- chunk -->

### make some people feel like they are going to have a heart attack.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was thick around the middle and after listening to his story and taking

<!-- chunk -->

### one look at him, I said, “You don’t eat breakfast, do you?

<!-- chunk -->

### “And you feel tired after eating so that is why you skip food during the day

<!-- chunk -->

### —to keep sharp for work—and when you feel like that you go for the vending

<!-- chunk -->

### machine or a soda and get a quick sugar fix and in a few minutes you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### better.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Shocked, he said, “How did you know?”

<!-- chunk -->

### I explained to him that he was fighting with his genes and was insulin-

<!-- chunk -->

### resistant. This caused his insulin levels to rise, pushing his blood sugar very low,

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to wide swings in blood sugar and, ultimately, overall low blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### (hypoglycemia). That was responsible for his symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, his hormones were severely out of balance and he was

<!-- chunk -->

### having panic attacks because of it.

<!-- chunk -->

### He couldn’t control his metabolism of carbohydrates because he had too

<!-- chunk -->

### much insulin in his blood. As a result his blood sugar was out of balance,

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to all his symptoms of anxiety, and taking him down the slippery slope

<!-- chunk -->

### toward brain aging, dementia, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### James is not alone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over 100 million Americans suffer from this condition we call insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance. It affects many varieties of people and is not exactly the same in

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone, but the ultimate consequences are the same: depression, dementia,

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, weight gain, heart disease, and cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most afflicted have extra fat around the middle. (To find out if this applies

<!-- chunk -->

### to you, check your waist-to-hip ratio. This is the measurement around your belly

<!-- chunk -->

### button divided by the measurement around the hips. If it is greater than 0.8, you

<!-- chunk -->

### likely have insulin resistance.)

<!-- chunk -->

### You may be tall or thin, short or fat, or any combination and still have

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

### While waist-to-hip ratio is a good indicator, the only sure way to know if

<!-- chunk -->

### you suffer from this condition is with an insulin-response test. This is done by

<!-- chunk -->

### measuring both your fasting blood sugar and your insulin levels, then measuring

<!-- chunk -->

### them again one or two hours later, after taking a 75 gm sugar drink. Your doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### can give you this test.(You will find some information on insulin testing in Part

<!-- chunk -->

### IV. I have also included an extensive section on testing in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide. Go to www.ultramind.com/guide and download the

<!-- chunk -->

### guide to access that information.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Insulin resistance is not a genetic defect, an error in our development, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### mistake by God. It is simply a result of the fact that we have strayed from eating

<!-- chunk -->

### in harmony with our genes.

# SWAMPED WITH SUGAR THE MANY NAMES OF INSULIN

# RESISTANCE

<!-- chunk -->

### When we eat too much sugar or refined carbohydrates, don’t exercise, and

<!-- chunk -->

### are too stressed, our bodies change. At first we pump out more insulin to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### our blood sugar even. Then our cells must have more and more insulin to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### our blood sugar even. That is called insulin resistance, and it is a condition I

<!-- chunk -->

### will discuss more in a moment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep eating sugar and over time you develop a collection of other

<!-- chunk -->

### problems—a fat belly, slightly high blood sugar levels (over 90), high

<!-- chunk -->

### triglycerides (over 100), low HDL (less than 60), high blood pressure (higher

<!-- chunk -->

### than 115/75), and inflammation in your blood. This is then called a “syndrome,”

<!-- chunk -->

### specifically, “metabolic syndrome.”

<!-- chunk -->

### This syndrome is also known as “prediabetes,” because it doesn’t meet the

<!-- chunk -->

### strict criteria for diabetes, which is a blood sugar over 126. But damage occurs

<!-- chunk -->

### to your brain and your blood vessels even before you get diabetes. The name

<!-- chunk -->

### “prediabetes” gives the impression that you are not quite in trouble yet. Nothing

<!-- chunk -->

### could be further from the truth.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these different “conditions,” or “illnesses,” are actually the result of

<!-- chunk -->

### one simple problem—eating too much sugar (or anything that quickly turns to

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar, like processed foods or products made from flour).

<!-- chunk -->

### Forget the fancy terms. Eating too much sugar and refined carbohydrates in

<!-- chunk -->

### any form is bad for your brain and your body. Period.

<!-- chunk -->

### Historically, we ate the equivalent of only 20 teaspoons of sugar a year as a

<!-- chunk -->

### hunter/gatherer species.


<!-- chunk -->

### Now we eat 158 pounds per person per year, or about

<!-- chunk -->

### 50 teaspoons or half a pound each day.


<!-- chunk -->

### The average schoolboy has 34 teaspoons

<!-- chunk -->

### of sugar a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 11: Rise in sugar consumption 1800–2008

<!-- chunk -->

### We evolved in a world without supermarkets, convenience stores, and fast-

<!-- chunk -->

### food restaurants. We had to work for our food and had limited access to refined

<!-- chunk -->

### foods or excess calories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now we spend more money on processed and junk food in convenience

<!-- chunk -->

### stores at gas stations than on gas. We spend more on fast food than on new cars,

<!-- chunk -->

### new computers, and higher education combined!

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, our genes are preagricultural. We started farming only ten thousand

<!-- chunk -->

### years ago and started refining flour only about two hundred years ago with the

<!-- chunk -->

### discovery of the steam engine–powered flour mill. The food industry has

<!-- chunk -->

### “progressed” a great deal in the last hundred years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our genes have not kept up with these technological innovations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet fifteen thousand low-fat foods (a.k.a. high-sugar, high-calorie foods)

<!-- chunk -->

### that we are not genetically designed to properly metabolize came onto the

<!-- chunk -->

### marketplace over the last fifteen to twenty years. The consequence? We have

<!-- chunk -->

### created an epidemic of increasing obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and brain


<!-- chunk -->

### The scientific foundation for the low-fat movement was shaky from the

<!-- chunk -->

### start. Unfortunately, Madison Avenue marketing companies overpowered

<!-- chunk -->

### medical science to the detriment of us all.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies normally produce insulin in response to food in our stomach,

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly sugar. Our genetic code evolved at a time when we were eating

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty teaspoons of sugar a year. That means our insulin response is designed to

<!-- chunk -->

### handle vastly lower levels of sugar than what we consume today.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our poor bodies respond to our new diet of low-fat, highly processed, and

<!-- chunk -->

### refined foods the only way they know how: they keep pumping out insulin in

<!-- chunk -->

### response to this overload of sugars.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eventually we become resistant to all this insulin in our blood, just as we

<!-- chunk -->

### would become resistant to a drug. The body needs more and more of it to do the

<!-- chunk -->

### same job it once did with far less. So our insulin production system spirals out of

<!-- chunk -->

### control, pumping ever more into our bodies.

<!-- chunk -->

### All this insulin tells us we are starving (that’s literally the message our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies get), so we crave foods with high-sugar content—the very same foods

<!-- chunk -->

### that caused the problem in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Perhaps this wouldn’t be so bad if insulin metabolized only sugar. We once

<!-- chunk -->

### thought that was insulin’s only role—to help sugar enter your cells to be

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolized, transforming the stored energy of the sun (in plant foods) with the

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen we breathe into the energy we use every day to run our bodies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is what too much insulin really does to your brain, your body, and

<!-- chunk -->

### your health:

<!-- chunk -->

### Now we recognize insulin as a major switching station, or control

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone, for many bodily processes. It is a major storage hormone—

<!-- chunk -->

### fat storage, that is.

<!-- chunk -->

### It also leads to mood and behavior disturbances such as depression, panic

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks, anxiety, insomnia, and ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try as you may, as long as your insulin levels are high you may fight a

<!-- chunk -->

### losing battle for weight loss. It acts on your brain to increase appetite

<!-- chunk -->

### —specifically an appetite for sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

### It increases LDL or “bad” cholesterol, lowers HDL or “good” cholesterol,

<!-- chunk -->

### raises triglycerides, and increases your blood pressure. Insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance causes 50 percent of all reported cases of high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

### It makes your blood sticky and more likely to clot, leading to heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks and strokes.

<!-- chunk -->

### It stimulates the growth of cancer cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### It increases inflammation and oxidative stress and ages your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to what is being called type 3 diabetes (also known as

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease).

<!-- chunk -->

### It increases homocysteine because sugar consumption decreases B


<!-- chunk -->

### and

<!-- chunk -->

### folate. That takes the methylation train off the tracks, making it hard

<!-- chunk -->

### for your brain to function and leading to more brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### It also causes sex hormone problems and can lead to infertility; hair

<!-- chunk -->

### growth where you don’t want it (your face if you’re a woman); hair

<!-- chunk -->

### loss where you don’t want to lose it (your head); acne in women; low

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone, loss of chest, leg, and arm hair, and breast growth in men;

<!-- chunk -->

### and more.

<!-- chunk -->

## What’s the Research on Insulin and How It Damages Your Brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Pioneering new work out of Harvard and Brown universities from Drs. Denis

<!-- chunk -->

### Selkoe and Suzanne de la Monte has proved that insulin resistance (also known

<!-- chunk -->

### as prediabetes) is a major factor in starting the cascade of brain damage that

<!-- chunk -->

### steals the memory of over half of people in their eighties, leading to a diagnosis

<!-- chunk -->

### of Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### The reason is that insulin resistance leads to a cascade of damage,


<!-- chunk -->

### which

<!-- chunk -->

### produces the inflammation so characteristic of brain problems, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia. (I will discuss why inflammation affects the brain this way in the next

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Do You Have Predementia?

<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t even have to wait until your eighties to start feeling the effects

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin resistance has on your memory. Many people now have what we call

<!-- chunk -->

### “predementia.”

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, you may notice that you have trouble remembering names and

<!-- chunk -->

### numbers. This may be a sign of predementia. While this memory loss could be

<!-- chunk -->

### the effect of stress (we know that the stress hormone, cortisol, destroys and kills

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain cells in the hippocampus responsible for memory), it may also be

<!-- chunk -->

### because of that little extra fat around your middle.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study of 2,632 men and women over five years published in the

<!-- chunk -->

### Journal of the American Medical Association


<!-- chunk -->

### found that those with metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome (or insulin resistance) and inflammation had dramatic declines in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is more serious than just forgetting your keys. It is called mild

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive impairment (MCI). Think of it as a prelude to dementia. What are the

<!-- chunk -->

### personal, social, and medical costs of this silent epidemic?

<!-- chunk -->

### A New York Times report on Alzheimer’s echoed research that makes it

<!-- chunk -->

### clear how powerfully our lifestyle impacts brain aging and how much we can do

<!-- chunk -->

### to reverse it:

<!-- chunk -->

### For years, the prevailing notion was that Alzheimer’s was a disease of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain-cell death. . . . But now, many researchers are asking if that old

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothesis is correct. If they are right, it may be possible to stop

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, and reverse the memory loss, if treatments begin before brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells die.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, new brain imaging techniques called PET scans (positron emission

<!-- chunk -->

### tomography), which look not at brain structure like a CT scan or regular MRI but

<!-- chunk -->

### at brain metabolism (cellular function and activity), have found altered and

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged brain function that occurs far in advance of the diagnosis of dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### Some experts say that changes can be identified decades before diagnosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### This process of decline, which is related to insulin resistance in particular,

<!-- chunk -->

### starts in childhood and adolescence. Given the epidemic of childhood obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### and the fact that we are seeing heart disease in twenty-year-olds, will we soon

<!-- chunk -->

### see an epidemic of Alzheimer’s when (or if) these kids turn forty?

<!-- chunk -->

### However, insulin resistance doesn’t lead only to cognitive decline, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Problems Created by Insulin Resistance

<!-- chunk -->

### It is well known that depression is more common in diabetics, but a Finnish

<!-- chunk -->

### study of young men found that those who had the worst insulin resistance had an

<!-- chunk -->

### almost threefold risk of having severe depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### One of my patients, a physician, was morbidly obese and had tried

<!-- chunk -->

### everything from liquid diets to gastric bypass, all of which failed. It wasn’t until

<!-- chunk -->

### he got his insulin under control that he was successful in losing a hundred

<!-- chunk -->

### pounds, but what was more remarkable was the transformation in his mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### his cravings.

<!-- chunk -->

### We often think cravings are psychological in nature, but just the way a child

<!-- chunk -->

### who is iron deficient may eat dirt, if we are overfed and undernour-ished with

<!-- chunk -->

### too many empty calories and not enough nutrients, our brains may search for

<!-- chunk -->

### more nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Food cravings go away almost instantly when the body is back in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is your hormones and nutritional deficiencies that drive your hunger.


<!-- chunk -->

### The doctor mentioned above told me that for the first time in his life he was

<!-- chunk -->

### not hungry twenty-four hours a day after we got his body (and specifically his

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin levels) back in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that all these problems from depression to dementia can

<!-- chunk -->

### be stopped and even reversed if intervention occurs early enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some simple dietary changes, a little exercise, relaxation, and a few

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements can completely correct and reverse insulin resistance and the

<!-- chunk -->

### catastrophic effects it has on the body and the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Balancing blood sugar and correcting insulin resistance are well within our

<!-- chunk -->

### reach, and the effects are dramatic. Major studies have shown that just regular

<!-- chunk -->

### walking is enough to prevent cognitive decline and dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### Scientific advances over the last few decades have given us the tools to

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent, stop, and even reverse cognitive decline and address all the mood

<!-- chunk -->

### disturbances that come with swings in blood sugar and insulin.

<!-- chunk -->

### While there are some new medications that can help, such as Glucophage

<!-- chunk -->

### and Actos, they have side effects and are only a Band-Aid unless used with a

<!-- chunk -->

### comprehensive nutritional, exercise, and stress management plan that is the

<!-- chunk -->

### foundation of the UltraMind Solution I provide in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

### My goal is to make your metabolism more efficient, to make your cells

<!-- chunk -->

### more intelligent and cooperative, not resistant. In other words, you may need

<!-- chunk -->

### much less insulin to accomplish the task of balancing your blood sugar. And

<!-- chunk -->

### your mood and memory may be protected from the mind-robbing effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin and sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now let’s look at the next hormone on our list—the thyroid.

## Scoring Key—Thyroid


<!-- chunk -->

### In my twenty years of medical practice I have seen an increasing amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid disease. The question is why. In my practice and my review of the

<!-- chunk -->

### research I have discovered the thyroid gland is the yellow canary in the body. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is sensitive to multiple influences from our diet, our lifestyle, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### environment, all of which influence its function.

<!-- chunk -->

### As our food environment has become more toxic and our exposure to

<!-- chunk -->

### pollution, petrochemical and industrial wastes, and heavy metals toxins have

<!-- chunk -->

### increased, our thyroid problems have also increased.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people are unaware of the connection between the environment, their

<!-- chunk -->

### diet, and their thyroid health. Yet these are increasingly important factors that

<!-- chunk -->

### need to be considered in order to help people resolve thyroid problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### More than 20 percent of women and 10 percent of men have lowthyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### function. Half of them are undiagnosed.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most people with thyroid problems

<!-- chunk -->

### are flying under the radar. As a result, many chronic symptoms go untreated,

<!-- chunk -->

### which causes people unnecessary suffering.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the most common symptoms of poor thyroid function:

<!-- chunk -->

### Fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### Sluggishness

<!-- chunk -->

### Trouble getting up in the morning

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Memory loss

<!-- chunk -->

### Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

### Dry skin and dry hair

<!-- chunk -->

### Constipation

<!-- chunk -->

### Fluid retention

<!-- chunk -->

### Menstrual problems

<!-- chunk -->

### Premenstrual syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### Hair loss

<!-- chunk -->

### Cracked, chipped fingernails

<!-- chunk -->

### Low sex drive

<!-- chunk -->

### Weight gain

<!-- chunk -->

### Muscle aches and cramps

<!-- chunk -->

### And more vague common symptoms that often are not effectively treated

<!-- chunk -->

### by modern medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### I remember the story of one patient who was seventy-three years old. This

<!-- chunk -->

### woman came to see me because when she went to her doctor with complaints of

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, sluggishness, poor memory, slight depression, dry skin, constipation,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a little fluid retention, her doctor said, “Well, what do you expect? You’re

<!-- chunk -->

### seventy-three and this is what seventy-three is supposed to feel like.”

<!-- chunk -->

### I don’t believe that is true. I believe that most of the symptoms of aging we

<!-- chunk -->

### see are really symptoms of abnormal aging or dysfunction that are related to

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in our core body systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### We tested this woman for a number of things and found she had a sluggish

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid. She did not quite meet all the criteria for a conventional diagnosis of

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroidism, but had an autoimmune reaction to her thyroid that led it to

<!-- chunk -->

### function poorly.

<!-- chunk -->

### After we simply replaced her missing thyroid hormone, supported her

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritionally, and implemented some simple lifestyle changes, she went from

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling old to feeling alert, energetic, and youthful and all of her other symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### cleared up.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research on how thyroid affects mood and cognitive function is clear. In

<!-- chunk -->

### one study of the elderly, “subclinical” hypothyroidism increased the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression four times.


<!-- chunk -->

### Yet many doctors prescribe Prozac before taking a good

<!-- chunk -->

### hard look at the thyroid and treating those who don’t yet have fullblown

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroidism.

<!-- chunk -->

### It seems that the thyroid hormone is critical for helping the brain make new

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells (neurogenesis), particularly in the hippocampus, which is responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for mood and memory.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, mood disorders in general, including bipolar disorder, areincreased in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with altered thyroid function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Research shows that lowthyroid hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### levels reduce the function of serotonin receptors (remember our discussion of

<!-- chunk -->

### these happy mood neurotransmitters and their receptors from chapter 6), which

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Aside from the clear effect thyroid has on mood, it is also clear that low

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid affects cognitive function, memory, and other indicators of slowed

<!-- chunk -->

### mental processing,


<!-- chunk -->

### and that treating the thyroid improves all areas of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning, including mood, mental processing, memory, and general cognitive


<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, even those doctors who do treat for thyroid conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### usually use just the inactive thyroid hormone or T4 (Synthroid, Levoxyl), hoping

<!-- chunk -->

### your body converts it to the active form or T3, which is the form of the hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### that actually works to boost your metabolism and improve your mood and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### power. But it is often necessary to give T3 itself to correct the mood and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### problems associated with lowthyroid function.

17;18

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, psychiatrists have proven that the use of T3 as a treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### depression is more effective than just using SSRIs,

19;20

<!-- chunk -->

### even though most other

<!-- chunk -->

### types of doctors generally think this is unnecessary or harmful. This is just one

<!-- chunk -->

### more example of the absolute segregation of medical specialties and lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### communication about important and effective treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

## Why Is There an Epidemic of Thyroid Problems?

<!-- chunk -->

### It is clear from the research that environmental chemicals have a direct

<!-- chunk -->

### impact on the thyroid gland.


<!-- chunk -->

### The thyroid produces hormones that run our

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and influence almost every function of the body; therefore, the effect

<!-- chunk -->

### of these environmental chemicals on the thyroid gland has wide-ranging effects

<!-- chunk -->

### on our system.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, PCBs and other industrial petrochemical toxins lower thyroid


<!-- chunk -->

### Other pollutants such as chlorine, fluoride, and bromine negatively

<!-- chunk -->

### influence thyroid function.


<!-- chunk -->

### These toxins increase the elimination of thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone, leaving us with less of it to facilitate our metabolism and brain


<!-- chunk -->

### Another important factor in thyroid function is food allergy. Food allergies,

<!-- chunk -->

### like those to gluten, and other food sensitivities also negatively affect thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### function and are frequently undiagnosed. I will discuss food allergies and how

<!-- chunk -->

### they relate to inflammation in chapter 8. However, you should keep in mind they

<!-- chunk -->

### can also impact your thyroid.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is important to understand the role of the environment and our nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### status, food allergens, and nutritional deficiencies—such as selenium, zinc, fish

<!-- chunk -->

### oil, iodine, and tyrosine (all of which are important for thyroid function)—if we

<!-- chunk -->

### are going to overcome this problem that has now reached epidemic proportions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, many of the common diagnostic tests used to assess our

<!-- chunk -->

### problems are often inadequate or incomplete. Therefore, many people who need

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment go untreated. You may have a low-functioning thyroid, yet not be

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with “hypothyroidism” (yet another name for a “disease” that isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### really a disease), because the current diagnostic criteria are outdated and don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### pick up more subtle problems with your thyroid.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also important to understand that the current treatments for thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, including Synthroid, are often less than adequate for many people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some require a more personalized approach that combines both the inactive, T4

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone found in Synthroid and the active, T3 hormone found in other

<!-- chunk -->

### medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### The thyroid also plays a huge role in weight control (and blood-sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### control) and, in fact, in determining your metabolic rate. I have seen so many

<!-- chunk -->

### patients struggle with their weight, only to have the pounds melt off and their

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and brain function improve when we addressed their thyroid problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sex Hormones: Puberty, PMS, Perimenopause, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Andropause

<!-- chunk -->

### “Seventy-five percent of women are found to have a mutant gene that

<!-- chunk -->

### threatens their relationships, work, and well-being.”

<!-- chunk -->

### “Over half of aging men will lose their sexual function, their testosterone

<!-- chunk -->

### levels will drop, and their estrogen levels will rise, making men more like

<!-- chunk -->

### women.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the beliefs that most of us unconsciously accept.

<!-- chunk -->

### Women are defective, flawed, broken, and destined to suffer throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### their reproductive life from the curse of mood and behavior swings that are the

<!-- chunk -->

### result of the three Ps: Puberty, PMS or premenstrual syndrome, and

<!-- chunk -->

### perimenopause (the years leading up to and just after your final period). This is

<!-- chunk -->

### the “genetic flaw” that supposedly threatens them.

<!-- chunk -->

### As they age, men, if you believe all the television commercials, supposedly

<!-- chunk -->

### need the little blue pill (Viagra) just to be men again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Is this just a “normal” part of being a woman or a man? Is it the product of

<!-- chunk -->

### some defective, mutant gene?

<!-- chunk -->

### Why do sex hormone levels drop up to 90 percent through the aging

<!-- chunk -->

### process?

<!-- chunk -->

### Are we destined to suffer from impaired mood, muscle loss, poor sleep,

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss, and sexual problems?

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course not!

<!-- chunk -->

### This suffering related to your reproductive life cycle is unnecessary. It is not

<!-- chunk -->

### bad luck, but bad habits such as drinking and smoking, our high-sugar and

<!-- chunk -->

### refined-carbohydrate diet, environmental toxins, and chronic stress that deplete

<!-- chunk -->

### our adrenal glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### These glands are the ones that produce most of the sex hormones later in

<!-- chunk -->

### life. Beat them to death with chronic stress and poor diet and lifestyle habits and

<!-- chunk -->

### your sex hormones may suffer. Let’s look at the result of these bad habits.

<!-- chunk -->

### But before we do . . .

<!-- chunk -->

### Are your sexual hormones out of balance? Take the following quiz to find

<!-- chunk -->

### out.

<!-- chunk -->

## Scoring Key—Sexual Hormones for Men


<!-- chunk -->

### PMS is a condition that causes mood swings, irritability, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, fluid retention, bloating, breast tenderness, sugar cravings, headaches,

<!-- chunk -->

### and sleep disturbances. It affects 75 percent of women.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 20 percent, it is so severe it requires medical treatment, and about

<!-- chunk -->

### percent have extreme symptoms that have been given a new name: premenstrual

<!-- chunk -->

### dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Of course, a new drug called Sarafem has been

<!-- chunk -->

### “discovered” to cure it (it is only Prozac with a different label). This was a great

<!-- chunk -->

### sleight of hand by the pharmaceutical industry, skilled at producing new diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### to match its drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### What about menopause? The brain fog, memory loss, mood swings,

<!-- chunk -->

### sleepless nights, vaginal dryness, low sex drive, palpitations, and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### common in menopause are simply signs of hormonal imbalances (estrogen,

<!-- chunk -->

### progesterone, and testosterone). But are you truly destined to suffer?

<!-- chunk -->

### And how about andropause? Although men experience a more gradual drop

<!-- chunk -->

### off in hormones, they too experience “andropause”—the slow decline in male

<!-- chunk -->

### (testosterone) and energy (DHEA) hormones, which leads to depression, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### and loss of mental sharpness, not to mention loss of sexual desire and function.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s wrong with this picture?

<!-- chunk -->

### It is based on the assumption that these symptoms are an inevitable part of

<!-- chunk -->

### aging and require “medical intervention” with serious medication to correct.

<!-- chunk -->

### Which is simply untrue.

<!-- chunk -->

### To think that 75 percent of women have a design flaw that gives them PMS

<!-- chunk -->

### and requires medical treatment to live a normal life is just absurd. To think that

<!-- chunk -->

### we all have to dwindle, shrivel, and lose our emotional, physical, and sexual

<!-- chunk -->

### vitality is a burdensome self-fulfilling prophecy.

<!-- chunk -->

### We now have endless examples of balance and thriving at any age. One of

<!-- chunk -->

### my eighty-one-year-old female patients with a twinkle in her eye recently told

<!-- chunk -->

### me about her new boyfriend and their wonderful love life.

<!-- chunk -->

### PMS, menopausal symptoms, and andropause are signs of imbalances in

<!-- chunk -->

### your sex hormones. They are not the result of mutant genes that destroy our

<!-- chunk -->

### sexual vitality as we age. Instead, they are treatable symptoms of underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance in one of the core systems in your body. Get the sex hormones back in

<!-- chunk -->

### balance, and these problems usually disappear.

<!-- chunk -->

### The emotional strain that comes with these conditions is a telling way to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the connection these hormones have to your mind, your body, and

<!-- chunk -->

### your reproductive cycle. It is yet another example of the way the body affects the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Depression or Hormonal Imbalance?

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me tell you the story of a patient of mine with PMDD. She was barely

<!-- chunk -->

### able to function. She suffered three weeks out of every month with severe

<!-- chunk -->

### physical symptoms and debilitating depression. Was she Prozac-deficient? I

<!-- chunk -->

### think not.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maureen was thirty-seven years old. Many women feel worsening PMS

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms as they get into their later reproductive years because of changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### hormonal cycles. Part of what Maureen experienced was severe depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue, anxiety, and food and sugar cravings that led to overeating and weight

<!-- chunk -->

### gain.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also had joint pains, breast tenderness, heavy bleeding, hot flashes, dry

<!-- chunk -->

### skin, acne, hair loss, trouble with memory, poor sleep, and no sex drive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maureen didn’t drink alcohol, but was a big coffee drinker. She started the

<!-- chunk -->

### day with a bagel and cheese, had a cafeteria lunch, chocolates in the afternoon,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a healthy dinner followed by binging on ice cream, potato chips, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Cheerios.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also complained of gas and bloating.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also ate a lot of dairy, which a lot of people (this woman included) are

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitive to.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a story I hear all too often. The good news is that there was a simple

<!-- chunk -->

### solution for Maureen that didn’t involve taking medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that sugar, caffeine, alcohol, stress, and lack of exercise all

<!-- chunk -->

### contribute to worsening PMS


<!-- chunk -->

### and hormonal imbalances, including menopause

<!-- chunk -->

### and andropause.


<!-- chunk -->

### It is also true that dairy consumption can worsen hormonal imbalances

<!-- chunk -->

### because of all the hormones in milk.

26;27

<!-- chunk -->

### Even organic milk can come from

<!-- chunk -->

### pregnant cows— jacking up hormone levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### I helped Maureen change her diet, cut out the sugar and caffeine, eliminate

<!-- chunk -->

### her food allergens, take a few supplements and herbs, do a little exercise, and

<!-- chunk -->

### within one menstrual cycle her life changed.

<!-- chunk -->

### All her symptoms resolved, she lost weight and dramatically increased her

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. Her mood stabilized (meaning her depression evaporated), and her acne

<!-- chunk -->

### and dry skin went away. All without medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### The approach I take to this problem is part of the overall approach of

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine. Define the imbalance (in Maureen’s case severe hormonal

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances), address the causes first (namely diet/lifestyle in this case), and then

<!-- chunk -->

### help the body repair and regain balance. The body’s natural intelligence takes

<!-- chunk -->

### care of the rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you use this method to rebalance the hormones, not only do the

<!-- chunk -->

### physical symptoms of PMS, menopause, or andropause disappear, but the mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms usually go away as well. That’s because sex hormones act on various

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of your brain that influence your mood and behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

## How Sex Hormones Act on the Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### What many people don’t know (although they experience this all the time) is

<!-- chunk -->

### that sex hormones act on the brain directly to affect mood and cognition.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, estrogen promotes the production of neurotransmitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially serotonin, making it a wonderful antidepressant (not to mention a

<!-- chunk -->

### great sleep aid).

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, there are receptors for all hormones, including estrogen, in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And estrogen in the brain seems to be neuroprotective, potentially

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing the risk of dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### But a little too much can cause breast, uterine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and cervical cancer. Getting the balance right is essential.

<!-- chunk -->

### Progesterone is another important sex hormone. Levels drop in PMS and in

<!-- chunk -->

### perimenopause, leading to increased anxiety and insomnia. There is evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### that natural, bioidentical (hormones identical to those produced by the body)

<!-- chunk -->

### progesterone reduces this anxiety and stress through its action on GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, the relaxing neurotransmitter—your body’s natural Valium.


<!-- chunk -->

### Testosterone is also a wonderful brain-boosting hormone that improves

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, memory, motivation, and overall cognitive function. It drops significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### in women and men with age and has an enormous impact on quality of life.


<!-- chunk -->

### But it drops mostly because of weight gain, lack of exercise, stress, and high-

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar diets—not because we are genetically designed to have less testosterone as

<!-- chunk -->

### we age.

<!-- chunk -->

### The biggest reason I see low testosterone in men is insulin resistance. High

<!-- chunk -->

### belly fat drives insulin up and testosterone down. That’s why men start looking

<!-- chunk -->

### like women and lose hair on their bodies, grow breasts, and have round, soft

<!-- chunk -->

### skin. It is because they are actually producing less testosterone and more

<!-- chunk -->

### estrogen. At the point that their estrogen levels exceed their testosterone levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### they sort of become women!

<!-- chunk -->

### Correcting insulin problems by eating whole foods, cutting out sugar and

<!-- chunk -->

### white flour, and doing some exercise to build muscle may naturally raise

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone levels. And if you are a man, be sure you root for the winning sports

<!-- chunk -->

### team, because research shows that when your team loses, your testosterone

<!-- chunk -->

### levels drop!


<!-- chunk -->

### I find, especially in older men, that giving them a little topical bioidentical

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone helps them build muscle and bone and lose weight; it relieves

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, stabilizes mood swings,


<!-- chunk -->

### improves memory and concentration,


<!-- chunk -->

### and improves sexual function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Even women benefit from the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### bioidentical testosterone in some cases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormone replacement therapy must be carefully administered under a

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor’s supervision after adequate testing. I strongly advocate the use of

<!-- chunk -->

### “nature-made” molecules to support normal function, rather than “new to

<!-- chunk -->

### nature” or man-made substances, which often have many unwanted and

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### That means supplementing your system with chemicals it already uses, like

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins or minerals, is usually a better treatment than using medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### This applies to hormones as well, which is why I recommend only

<!-- chunk -->

### bioidentical hormones. Used intelligently, at the right time, for the right patient,

<!-- chunk -->

### in the right dose, for the right amount of time, they can be lifesaving.

<!-- chunk -->

### But 80 percent of the time, simply changing your diet and lifestyle,

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxifying, addressing stress, and rebalancing all the other seven keys to

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness can often help you regain balance without taking hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### To do this, you need to know what is sending your hormones out of balance

<!-- chunk -->

### to begin with.

<!-- chunk -->

## Why Are Our Sex Hormones Out of Balance?

<!-- chunk -->

### Sex hormones can become unbalanced in both men and women. But why

<!-- chunk -->

### does this happen?

<!-- chunk -->

### PMS and perimenopausal symptoms most women experience are because

<!-- chunk -->

### their hormones are out of balance. Estrogen levels actually increase, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### from the age of about thirty to fifty, and progesterone levels decrease either

<!-- chunk -->

### relatively or absolutely. Testosterone levels drop off in men and women, leading

<!-- chunk -->

### to a loss of energy, depression, and low sex drive.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many things promote these imbalances in hormones, such as a high-sugar,

<!-- chunk -->

### refined carbohydrate diet, caffeine, stress, dairy (if you are sensitive to it),

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones in the food supply in dairy products and meat, and estrogen-like toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### from pesticides, plastics, and pollution.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise also helps keep hormones in balance. If you don’t get enough of it,

<!-- chunk -->

### they will get out of balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol damages the liver and prevents it from excreting excess estrogen,

<!-- chunk -->

### yet another factor that influences hormonal imbalance. Men who drink too much

<!-- chunk -->

### literally grow breasts along with their beer bellies!

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition, constipation and imbalances in the gut bacteria can lead to the

<!-- chunk -->

### reabsorption of estrogen from the gut back into your blood, even after your liver

<!-- chunk -->

### has tried to get rid of it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before I close this chapter, there is one more issue I want to discuss that has

<!-- chunk -->

### a major impact on all the hormones and many other biological processes as well

<!-- chunk -->

### —sleep. You need it if you are going to stay in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lights Out: Why We Need More Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people don’t know that sleep deprivation leads to depression, chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### pain, heart disease, diabetes, and makes you fat!

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, beside eating whole foods and moving your body, getting enough

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep is the most important thing you can do for your health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet it is estimated that 70 percent of Americans are sleep-deprived.

<!-- chunk -->

### The era of Starbucks has been surpassed by prescription stimulants to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### people awake and functioning, like dexadrine and Ritalin, otherwise known as

<!-- chunk -->

### “speed” or amphetamines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Surprisingly, I see an increasing number of patients prescribed these uppers

<!-- chunk -->

### by their psychiatrist because coffee is not enough. If we can’t do ten things at

<!-- chunk -->

### once, then something must be wrong with us, right?

<!-- chunk -->

### Wrong!

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies and biological rhythms, which keep us healthy, produce cyclic

<!-- chunk -->

### pulses of healing and repair hormones, including melatonin


<!-- chunk -->

### and growth

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone.

38;39

<!-- chunk -->

### When those rhythms are disturbed by inadequate or insufficient

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, disease and breakdown get the upper hand. Sleep also helps us maintain

<!-- chunk -->

### low levels of cortisol—the stress hormone that makes us depressed and fat (see

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter 12).

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us need at least seven to eight hours of restful sleep a night.

<!-- chunk -->

### Getting this is more and more difficult. Yet we evolved along with the

<!-- chunk -->

### rhythms of day and night. Our bodies use these rhythms to signal a whole

<!-- chunk -->

### cascade of hormonal and neurochemical reactions that keep us healthy by

<!-- chunk -->

### repairing our DNA, building tissues and muscle, and regulating weight and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood chemicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### The lightbulb changed all that.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, not following the normal rhythms of day and night can be deadly.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, when I learned that shift work (like I did in when I worked in the

<!-- chunk -->

### emergency room) leads to a shortened life expectancy, I quit.


<!-- chunk -->

### When we are sleep-deprived our cortisol rises with all its harmful effects,

<!-- chunk -->

### including brain damage and dementia, weight gain, diabetes, heart attacks, high

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure, depression, osteoporosis, reduced immune function, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep deprivation also leads to depression, decreased cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### performance, and even decreased reaction times.


<!-- chunk -->

### Good sleep is not something that just happens (unless you are a baby or

<!-- chunk -->

### teenager). There are clearly defined things that interfere with or support healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep. By following the six-week plan in Part III of The UltraMind Solution, you

<!-- chunk -->

### may restore your natural sleep rhythm.

<!-- chunk -->

### It may take weeks or months, but using these tools in a coordinated way

<!-- chunk -->

### will eventually reset your biological rhythms.

<!-- chunk -->

### But you have to prioritize sleep!

<!-- chunk -->

### When I first started practicing, I thought M.D. stood for “medical deity”

<!-- chunk -->

### and meant I didn’t have to follow the same sleep rules as every other human

<!-- chunk -->

### being. Was I wrong! Working one hundred hours a week, sometimes sixty hours

<!-- chunk -->

### straight, being up at night delivering babies, then working all day in the office,

<!-- chunk -->

### had a catastrophic effect on my health, and ultimately contributed to my chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our lives are infiltrated with stimuli and we stay stimulated until the

<!-- chunk -->

### moment we get into bed. This is not the way to get restful sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Is it any wonder we can’t sleep well when we eat a late dinner, answer e-

<!-- chunk -->

### mails, surf the Web or work, and then get right into bed and watch the evening

<!-- chunk -->

### news about all the disaster, pain, and suffering in the world?

<!-- chunk -->

### We must take a little “holiday” in the two hours before bed. Creating a sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### ritual, a special set of little things you do before bed to help ready your system

<!-- chunk -->

### physically and psychologically for sleep, can guide your body into a deep

<!-- chunk -->

### healing sleep. In Part III, I will teach you how to achieve a sound and restful

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep every night.

<!-- chunk -->

### So remember—don’t skimp on sleep. It is one of the most powerful healing

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments for your body that is available to you every day. In Part III you will

<!-- chunk -->

### learn how to restore healthy sleep.

# SPECIAL NOTE: SLEEP APNEA

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you snore? Are you tired most of the day? Do you have trouble focusing,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrating, and feel depressed? Do you nod off when you sit down to watch

<!-- chunk -->

### TV or read, or worse when you are driving? You could be one of the 18 million

<!-- chunk -->

### people (80 percent of whom are not diagnosed


<!-- chunk -->

### ) who have sleep apnea, a

<!-- chunk -->

### condition where your airway closes off periodically at night, interrupting your

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep as well as leading to high blood pressure, weight gain, and even heart

<!-- chunk -->

### failure. If you think you may have this problem, ask your doctor about testing

<!-- chunk -->

### and treatment. It could save your life.

<!-- chunk -->

## Balance Your Hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### Balance is the key to staying healthy. Nowhere is this truer than in the world

<!-- chunk -->

### of hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not think of your hormones separately but as interconnected parts of the

<!-- chunk -->

### whole that affect one another.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones are also influenced by imbalances in the seven keys. Our body is

<!-- chunk -->

### one whole system where everything is linked to everything else. So improving

<!-- chunk -->

### your nutrition, reducing inflammation, fixing your gut, and getting rid of toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### all support normalization of hormone function, which translates into better

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, more focus, and enhanced brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone has a different balance point and needs a little more tweaking

<!-- chunk -->

### here or there to get in balance, but following the basic six-week UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution in Part III will provide a strong foundation. Then you can customize

<!-- chunk -->

### your approach based on where you find you are most out of balance using the

<!-- chunk -->

### steps in Part IV.

<!-- chunk -->

### Balancing your hormones is a process, and sometimes it has little twists and

<!-- chunk -->

### turns, but by sticking with it, you can figure out how to restore yourself to the

<!-- chunk -->

### vital, happy, alert, brilliant, and thriving being you are.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the next chapter you will learn how brain inflammation has been linked

<!-- chunk -->

### to everything from autism to Alzheimer’s, from depression to ADHD. Our brains

<!-- chunk -->

### are on fire. Find out why and what to do about it.


# KEY #3: COOL OFF INFLAMMATION


<!-- chunk -->

### Can your brain become inflamed? Can you have a “swollen brain” like a

<!-- chunk -->

### swollen, arthritic knee? Can you have a “sore brain” like a sore throat? Until

<!-- chunk -->

### recently, except in cases of brain infections (such as meningitis or encephalitis),

<!-- chunk -->

### brain inflammation was considered rare.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, new evidence links hidden brain inflammation to almost every

<!-- chunk -->

### known “brain disease,” from depression to dementia, from autism to anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### from schizophrenia to sociopathic behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain is on fire in the twenty-first century. If one in three Americans

<!-- chunk -->

### suffers from a mental illness, and 14 million Americans will soon have

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, and nearly all mood disorders and age-related brain diseases are

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of an inflamed or “sore” brain, then this problem touches nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, inflammation doesn’t affect only the brain. We are seeing the

<!-- chunk -->

### flames in every disease, including autoimmunity (24 million), allergy (50

<!-- chunk -->

### million), and asthma (30 million), as well as cardiovascular disease (60 million),

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer (10 million), and diabetes (14 million). These, it has been recently

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered, are primarily inflammatory conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### You might say we are all on fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is that it’s sometimes hard to locate the source of this fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because systemic inflammation, which contributes to all of these conditions, is

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic, it can be difficult to figure out what is fueling this unseen, internal

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation in the first place. Why do our bodies become inflamed?

<!-- chunk -->

### Finding an answer to this question is the key to healing all chronic illness,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially mental and brain disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then, once we find the fire, we have to learn how to cool it way down.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the fire often comes from many unexpected places—foods we eat,

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins in the environment, hidden infections, unknown allergens, and stress. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you want to address your swollen, inflamed brain, you have to find the source of

<!-- chunk -->

### the fire and stomp it out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start by understanding what systemic inflammation is, what problems

<!-- chunk -->

### are caused by brain inflammation, and, finally, the causes of this unseen fire in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### But first, find out if your brain is on fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take the following quiz to find out how inflamed you are and how this

<!-- chunk -->

### affects your brain.

### Scoring Key—Inflammation


# What Is Systemic (Whole-Body) Inflammation? The

# Smoldering Fire Within

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us are familiar with inflammation. Classic signs are pain, swelling,

<!-- chunk -->

### redness, and heat. Think about a bad sore throat, a swollen knee, or an infected

<!-- chunk -->

### fingernail. In each case, the part of your body that’s affected is inflamed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation is part of the body’s natural defense system against infection,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation, toxins, and foreign molecules. When your body detects problems like

<!-- chunk -->

### these, a cascade of events occurs in which white blood cells and chemicals called

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines (see the text box on page 175 to learn more about these important

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals) mobilize to protect you from foreign invaders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this capacity, inflammation is a good thing. It fights foreign invaders of

<!-- chunk -->

### all types.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, when the natural balance of your immune system (which

<!-- chunk -->

### produces just enough inflammation to keep infections, allergens, toxins, or other

<!-- chunk -->

### stressors under control) is disrupted, the immune system shifts into a chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### state of alarm, spreading a smoldering fire of inflammation throughout the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### In essence, the part of your immune system that is designed to protect you

<!-- chunk -->

### from foreign invaders starts attacking the cells and tissues of your own body.

<!-- chunk -->

### When this happens it can create major problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### This fire in the heart causes heart disease, in our fat cells causes obesity, in

<!-- chunk -->

### the whole body causes cancer, in the eyes causes blindness, and, when this fire

<!-- chunk -->

### spreads to your brain, it can cause depression, dementia, autism, ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, forgetfulness, and a host of other problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### This inflammatory process may go awry, not only in individuals with

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory diseases but in otherwise healthy people whose lifestyles and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### environments expose them to substances the body perceives as irritants, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### low-grade infections from gum disease, food allergens, toxins, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory foods such as sugar and animal fat. (You will learn more about

<!-- chunk -->

### each of these specific causes of inflammation later in the chapter.)

<!-- chunk -->

### While inflammation is sometimes obvious, such as when an injured area

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes swollen, red, and warm to the touch, science is teaching us that

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation can occur silently and insidiously, without any symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### To understand how profound inflammation can be to brain health, I want to

<!-- chunk -->

### look at three conditions that may be caused by inflammation: autism, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### and Alzheimer’s. If we understand how inflammation plays a role in these

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions, we will have an opportunity to treat all problems of brain function in

<!-- chunk -->

### a radically different way.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most psychiatric and neurological problems, in some way, are just the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### on fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### CYTOKINES:

<!-- chunk -->

### THE MESSENGER MOLECULES OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM

<!-- chunk -->

### Cytokines are a class of proteins that are the “language” of your

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system, much in the way neurotransmitters are the “language” of

<!-- chunk -->

### your nervous system, and hormones are the “language” of your endocrine

<!-- chunk -->

### system or hormone-secreting glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### These chemicals can either promote or reduce inflammation. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### the main communication system that controls inflammation and directs

<!-- chunk -->

### your immune system to heal.

<!-- chunk -->

### When triggered by toxins, infections, allergens, stress, a bad diet, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### sedentary lifestyle, cytokines run out of control starting fires all over the

<!-- chunk -->

### body and brain. There are 400,000 scientific studies on the role of these

<!-- chunk -->

### immune messengers in almost every disease. Inflammation does not

<!-- chunk -->

### respect the artificial boundaries of medical specialties.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, when it comes to chronic illnesses—whether physical or mental

<!-- chunk -->

### — everywhere we look, there they are. Dementia, depression, ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### autism, chronic fatigue, obesity, heart disease, cancer, and, of course,

<!-- chunk -->

### allergic and autoimmune diseases are all related to elevated levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### cytokines and systemic inflammation. They can cause problems in every

<!-- chunk -->

### organ, in every part of the body.


# “Brain Disease” and Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### Often we think of bad moods, unusual behavior, hyperactivity, or trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrating as evidence of some psychological problem, much like we once

<!-- chunk -->

### thought autism and schizophrenia were the result of poor mothering. But new

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific findings are shaking up our thinking.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Role of Inflammation and the Example of Autism

<!-- chunk -->

### The most startling and convincing story comes from the world of autism. As

<!-- chunk -->

### I have said before, autism is just an extreme example of what can go wrong with

<!-- chunk -->

### our brain. The same things happen in depression, Alzheimer’s, or almost any

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric or neurological problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### As the nature of disease gets uncovered, the common underlying roots of all

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses become apparent. Autism and Alzheimer’s are almost the same disease

<!-- chunk -->

### showing up at the opposite end of the age spectrum—the metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemistry, and causes all map over one another.

<!-- chunk -->

### Martha Herbert, M.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor of neurology at

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvard Medical School, has put together a remarkable story of autism, which is

<!-- chunk -->

### like a hologram through which we can see the systemic nature of most illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her landmark paper, “Autism: A brain disorder, or a disorder that affects the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain?”


<!-- chunk -->

### will change forever our thinking about mental and brain illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Herbert looked very carefully at autistic children’s brains on MRI scans.

<!-- chunk -->

### She noticed their brains were bigger than children who did not have autism.


<!-- chunk -->

### The

<!-- chunk -->

### question that remained was why.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s where Dr. Diana Vargas and her group from Johns Hopkins came in.

<!-- chunk -->

### They examined the brains on autopsy of eleven autistic children who had died.


<!-- chunk -->

### They also looked at the spinal fluid of living autistic children. By examining and

<!-- chunk -->

### comparing these factors, they proved that these children’s brains were swollen

<!-- chunk -->

### and inflamed, like a swollen ankle!

<!-- chunk -->

### This brought up another question: why were their brains inflamed to begin

<!-- chunk -->

### with?

<!-- chunk -->

### The short answer is allergens, toxins, infections, and nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### But where do problems like these come from and how do they affect the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain? Are they in the brain to begin with? Well, many times they may not be.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has long been known that children with autism not only have misfiring

<!-- chunk -->

### and wiring of their brain, but that 95 percent of autistic children have

<!-- chunk -->

### gastrointestinal problems and swollen bellies. It has also been noted that autistic

<!-- chunk -->

### children have frequent infections and allergies, and have often had multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### courses of antibiotics. And according to the MIND Institute at the University of

<!-- chunk -->

### California at Davis, more than 70 percent of children on the autistic spectrum

<!-- chunk -->

### have altered immune function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most doctors assume these are annoying but secondary problems, meaning

<!-- chunk -->

### they have nothing to do with why autistic children’s brains are not working

<!-- chunk -->

### properly or why their brains are swollen and inflamed.

<!-- chunk -->

### But according to Dr. Herbert, the opposite seems to be true. These gut,

<!-- chunk -->

### immune, and toxicity problems are integrally related to and often the cause of

<!-- chunk -->

### what happens in the brain. In fact, she suggests that autism is really a systemic

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorder that changes brain function. The brain and body function as a

<!-- chunk -->

### whole system. And multiple chronic, insidious triggers can throw the brain into

<!-- chunk -->

### chaos.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you will learn in chapter 9 when I discuss the gut, more than 60 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of the immune system is in the digestive tract. When that key system in the body

<!-- chunk -->

### is thrown out of balance, your immune system is triggered and widespread

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic inflammation can often result.

<!-- chunk -->

### We insult our digestive tract every day. We do everything to harm it and

<!-- chunk -->

### hardly anything to help it work as it was designed. We eat food low in fiber, high

<!-- chunk -->

### in sugar, and full of antibiotics, pesticides, and hormones; we drink alcohol and

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeine; we take antibiotics, acid-blocking medication, anti-inflammatory drugs,

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, and steroids; we are under constant stress; and we are exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of environmental toxins, all of which damage the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### These factors create widespread inflammation because our gut immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system reacts to all the foreign proteins in food and all the myriad of bugs and

<!-- chunk -->

### gets “angry” and inflamed.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if inflammation starts in the belly (and so many autistic children have

<!-- chunk -->

### swollen bellies), then spreads to the brain, it can literally lead to a swollen brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the effects can be disastrous.

<!-- chunk -->

### Imagine the extraordinary beauty and dance of the brain where everything

<!-- chunk -->

### is exquisitely regulated. The timing and coordination of nerve-cell firing and the

<!-- chunk -->

### amplitude (or volume) of the message has to be just right. Filters that modulate

<!-- chunk -->

### our sensory inputs must let in only the information we need. The activity of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain must be exquisitely synchronized for us to be awake, alert, receptive,

<!-- chunk -->

### interactive, communicative, flexible, and happy.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what if the signals start misfiring and the coordination and

<!-- chunk -->

### synchronization break down because of multiple metabolic disturbances such as

<!-- chunk -->

### ineffective enzymes or cell function due to insults from toxins, infections,

<!-- chunk -->

### allergens, or nutritional deficiencies?

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the net effect of inflammation, whatever the original cause. It

<!-- chunk -->

### triggers a runaway cascade of damaging effects. All mental processing slows,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters can’t do their job, cell membranes don’t function the way they

<!-- chunk -->

### were designed, cellular enzymes get hijacked or derailed, cells get sent into a

<!-- chunk -->

### death spiral called apoptosis and the delicate network of cellular connections and

<!-- chunk -->

### communications is interrupted and altered.

<!-- chunk -->

### How does that show up? As autism or Alzheimer’s or depression. It

<!-- chunk -->

### depends on the unique genetic makeup and environment of each individual

<!-- chunk -->

### person. In the children discussed above, the result of this inflammation is autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### In you, it may be anything from a bad mood to dementia to hyperactivity and

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty focusing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whatever the case, at the end of the day we are all suffering from swollen

<!-- chunk -->

### brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### These problems may not show up on the radar of conventional testing, but

<!-- chunk -->

### they wreak havoc in your body and your brain. We see this havoc as altered

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, mood, and memory. It is precisely in these metabolic disturbances that

<!-- chunk -->

### we need to look for answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation has enormous implications for treating autism and most

<!-- chunk -->

### “brain disorders.” Our broken brains may be due to fixable metabolic problems

<!-- chunk -->

### created by digestive imbalances, toxins, foods, allergens, and hidden infections,

<!-- chunk -->

### and worsened by nutritional deficiencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scientists are now asking the question why? Why do we find more mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### in autistic children? What is the effect of mercury on the brain? Why do these

<!-- chunk -->

### children have altered immune function? Why do they have more viral

<!-- chunk -->

### infections? Why do we find measles virus in the intestinal lining of these

<!-- chunk -->

### children and in their spinal fluid? What is the effect of giving babies nine

<!-- chunk -->

### immunizations at one doctor’s visit, or twenty-seven by the time they are two

<!-- chunk -->

### years old? How do these all trigger inflammation and how does this cause

<!-- chunk -->

### autism?

<!-- chunk -->

### Questions like these force us to ask how biology, brain, and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### connect.

<!-- chunk -->

## There Is No Gene for Autism: Looking at All the Causes

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have been searching for the one autism gene, or the one location

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain that is damaged, that leads to autism. Looking for these kinds of

<!-- chunk -->

### answers implies that the changes that cause autism (or other “brain disorders”)

<!-- chunk -->

### are genetically hard-wired and therefore treatment is hopeless.

<!-- chunk -->

### But these researchers are looking in the wrong place for the source of the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### These same metabolic and environmental problems hold true for the 1 in

<!-- chunk -->

### children with some type of developmental problem, the 1 in 10 with ADHD, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the 1 in 150 with autism. Each of these may be problems related to underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders, and not the result of genetically hard-wired diseases or

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged brains. It is all the same problem just showing up slightly differently in

<!-- chunk -->

### different kids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Herbert suggests that many different causes can lead to the same

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, namely the lack of language and social connection and the rigidity

<!-- chunk -->

### and inflexibility of behavior seen in children with autism, as well as many

<!-- chunk -->

### “behavioral” problems in children such as those with ADHD. A few common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways result in the same symptoms from a host of different insults. There

<!-- chunk -->

### may be many “autisms,” each caused by slightly different factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rather than studying drugs that affect the brain to treat autism, the better

<!-- chunk -->

### path may be studying treatments that target inflammation, toxins, allergens,

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, or fixing biochemical train wrecks (like problems with methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### and sulfation), and gut problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Treating the gut, or giving B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate, omega-3 fats, vitamins A or

<!-- chunk -->

### D, or magnesium and zinc, or eliminating gluten and casein (the protein in dairy

<!-- chunk -->

### that so many are sensitive to) from the diet, or detoxifying mercury and lead

<!-- chunk -->

### from their little bodies may be the best way to get autistic children’s brain

<!-- chunk -->

### connections working again.

<!-- chunk -->

## Quite a notion! Treat the body, and heal the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The experience of thousands of children, parents, scientists, and doctors

<!-- chunk -->

### who are part of a unique collaborative effort called DAN!, or Defeat Autism

<!-- chunk -->

### Now! (www.autism.com), confirms that this approach helps children recover—

<!-- chunk -->

### some slightly, some miraculously—from a disorder that was thought incurable.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, we must look at

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. We need to look for the connections, patterns, and final common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways that have enormous implications for so many “fixed” diseases. If

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery and improvement are documented in autism, what does that mean for

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, chronic depression, bipolar disease, psychosis, eating disorders, or

<!-- chunk -->

### violent sociopathic behavior?

<!-- chunk -->

### These problems, it seems, are not hard-wired into the brain, as we believed,

<!-- chunk -->

### but the result of a few common systemic problems that completely mess up the

<!-- chunk -->

### fine dance and coordination of the brain—problems that can be fixed

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically and systemically.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Herbert’s TRANSCEND (Treatment, Research, and Neuroscience

<!-- chunk -->

### Evaluation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) research program at Harvard is

<!-- chunk -->

### breaking radical new ground in looking at the brain as part of the whole body

<!-- chunk -->

### system. Stay tuned, because I believe their work will change not only our

<!-- chunk -->

### perception of autism but of all disease and the nature of research itself by

<!-- chunk -->

### changing what questions we ask, how we ask them, and how we search for

<!-- chunk -->

### answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now is the moment in medical science that parallels the shift in thinking

<!-- chunk -->

### that occurred when Christopher Columbus said the world was round or Galileo

<!-- chunk -->

### proposed that the earth was not the center of the universe but revolved around

<!-- chunk -->

### the sun.

<!-- chunk -->

### The implications across the entire spectrum of suffering and illness are

<!-- chunk -->

### profound.

<!-- chunk -->

### Is Depression a Systemic Inflammatory Disease?

<!-- chunk -->

### How can exercise and fish oil often be a more effective treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### depression than antidepressants? Could it be because they are both potent anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatories? Could it be that depression is a low-grade inflammatory disease

<!-- chunk -->

### of the brain?


<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at the evidence.


<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF a (molecular messengers

<!-- chunk -->

### that set off the inflammatory response) and bacterial toxins (produced in

<!-- chunk -->

### our gut for reasons we will explore in chapter 9) produce symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Cytokines overactivate the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis

<!-- chunk -->

### (the stress response), just as we find in depressed patients.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Cytokines increase the function of an enzyme (IDO) that breaks down

<!-- chunk -->

### tryptophan, leading to less serotonin in the brain.


<!-- chunk -->

## 4. The immune system is overactive in severe depression, producing brain


<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Using immune therapy like interferon (a cytokine) for diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### hepatitis C or multiple sclerosis triggers depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Depression is more common in inflammatory diseases like autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and heart disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### As compelling as these pieces of information are, they are not the only

<!-- chunk -->

### indications that depression is caused by an inflamed brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers from the Free University of Berlin discovered a new virus

<!-- chunk -->

### called Bornavirus found in the limbic system (or emotional center) of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### in 30 percent of the population. One in six people who carry the virus have

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and can be cured by treatment with short-term anti-viral medication.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think about it: a virus can cause depression and treating the virus can cure, not

<!-- chunk -->

### just reduce the symptoms of, depression. Even the best antidepressant drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t cure depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### And there is more evidence that inflammation can cause depression. A new

<!-- chunk -->

### technique called vagal nerve stimulation is very helpful in depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### The

<!-- chunk -->

### vagus nerve is your calming, relaxation nerve. When you take a deep breath,

<!-- chunk -->

### meditate, or do yoga, the nerve is activated and it releases acetylcholine, which

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines.

<!-- chunk -->

### There may be many reasons deep breathing and relaxation work, but

<!-- chunk -->

### certainly one of them is the fact that inflammation is reduced.

<!-- chunk -->

### We also know that omega-3 fats help depression and produce remission.


<!-- chunk -->

### They work through lowering inflammation, and also through their effects on cell

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes and communication.

<!-- chunk -->

### Similarly, we know that exercise is an anti-inflammatory and works better

<!-- chunk -->

### than Prozac in treating depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another example comes out of Harvard. A group of researchers there

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered an increased number of “white matter lesions” or little white spots in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain that are seen in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis in

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed patients. This correlated with low levels of folate, which caused high

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of homocysteine, a molecule that causes inflammation in the brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### So

<!-- chunk -->

### being vitamin-deficient produces toxic molecules that inflame the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### cause depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, we must ask, “What came first, the chicken or the egg? Does

<!-- chunk -->

### depression cause inflammation or inflammation cause depression?”

<!-- chunk -->

### The answer is yes. It is a vicious cycle. Inflammation leads to depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### which leads to more inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The message is that to adequately treat depression we must look for, find,

<!-- chunk -->

### and eliminate the causes of inflammation and then help the body create balance

<!-- chunk -->

### in the immune system, turning off this vicious cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of the things that create inflammation not only cause depression but also

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and bipolar disease. Of course,

<!-- chunk -->

### we must remember that these are just names of collections of symptoms we give

<!-- chunk -->

### people. The causes may be very different from person to person. But within the

<!-- chunk -->

### seven keys we can find the causes, and we must treat all of them for people to

<!-- chunk -->

### heal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Looked at as a whole, the pieces of the scientific puzzle make sense. In a

<!-- chunk -->

### separate but connected example, there is a form of OCD that is well documented

<!-- chunk -->

### in children called PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### Associated with Streptococcal Infections). This condition causes children to

<!-- chunk -->

### suffer from the strange obsessions and compulsions “called” OCD—anything

<!-- chunk -->

### from repeatedly washing hands, or opening and closing doors, to counting

<!-- chunk -->

### objects, to involuntary movements. It is triggered by an infection with

<!-- chunk -->

### streptococcus.


<!-- chunk -->

### The streptococcal bacteria release toxins that produce

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation in the brain. Treat the bacteria with antibiotics, inflammation in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain is reduced, and the OCD goes away.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why aren’t we looking at models like this one as a way to treat other “brain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders”? Why do we insist on viewing them as “psychiatric problems” instead

<!-- chunk -->

### of systemic imbalances?

<!-- chunk -->

### Surprising discoveries like the ones above break open new territory for

<!-- chunk -->

### treating mood disorders, particularly depression. Treating infections, eliminating

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies, learning to deeply relax, exercising, and taking vitamins and fish oil all

<!-- chunk -->

### can reduce inflammation and fix depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### But we must remember that it is not either/or, it is and. Illness (whether it is

<!-- chunk -->

### mental or physical) is not usually one thing. It is often everything—just to

<!-- chunk -->

### different degrees in different people. Hundreds of my patients with mood

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders improve simply by addressing the inflammation. It is an “accidental”

<!-- chunk -->

### side effect of treating their other problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The lesson? Treat the fire, not the smoke.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just like I did for Elizabeth.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elizabeth was a twenty-one-year-old woman who suffered, as many of my

<!-- chunk -->

### patients do, from a long list of problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the top of the list were mood problems that had plagued her since

<!-- chunk -->

### childhood. She had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### borderline personality disorder because of her wild mood swings.

<!-- chunk -->

### At work, people avoided her, never knowing what to expect, and she was

<!-- chunk -->

### always fighting with her parents.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was high strung, irritable, and also had trouble concentrating. Sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### cravings drove her to the fridge every day after work—pudding, pizza, and junk

<!-- chunk -->

### food were staples and late-night snacking was hard to control.

<!-- chunk -->

### She had been on Zoloft since she was thirteen. Now, an adult and five-foot-

<!-- chunk -->

### one-inch tall, her weight ballooned up to 170 pounds. Not only was she tired

<!-- chunk -->

### (though she was sleeping ten hours a night) but she also had allergies, postnasal

<!-- chunk -->

### drip, sinus congestion, fluid in her ears, and snored.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her delayed or IgG food-allergy tests showed she was highly sensitive to

<!-- chunk -->

### eggs, wheat, rye, dairy, and yeast. She also had low levels of omega-3 fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### I put Elizabeth on an elimination diet—giving her a break from foods that

<!-- chunk -->

### triggered her immune system. I added a few vitamins, including vitamin D and


6,

<!-- chunk -->

### and omega-3 fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two months later she came back. She had lost twenty-three pounds and her

<!-- chunk -->

### cravings were gone. But it was the mood change she experienced that was truly

<!-- chunk -->

### astounding. Her mood changed for the first time in her life. She no longer had

<!-- chunk -->

### wild mood swings or irritability.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her energy level dramatically improved as well. She needed only seven to

<!-- chunk -->

### eight hours of sleep to feel fully and vitally awake.

<!-- chunk -->

### After five months she had lost thirty-three pounds without trying, felt deeply

<!-- chunk -->

### happy for the first time in her life, and was thriving at work and in her family.

<!-- chunk -->

### All her other symptoms—sinus problems, postnasal drip, and premenstrual

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome—were gone as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s: The Brain on Fire

<!-- chunk -->

### When we look at an autopsy of an Alzheimer’s brain we see a brain on fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### Considering that the fastest-growing segment of the population is people eighty

<!-- chunk -->

### and older (and more than half of them will get Alzheimer’s), we must focus on

<!-- chunk -->

### finding the cause. The good news is that we are closer than ever to

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding what goes wrong.

<!-- chunk -->

### The inflammation story is repeated over and over in all disease, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatically so in aging and the brain. This is why sugar, trans fats, saturated fat,

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, infections, lack of exercise, autoimmune disease, obesity, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin deficiencies, celiac disease (from eating wheat and gluten), and colitis,

<!-- chunk -->

### which are inflammatory digestive diseases, all increase the risk of dementia and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.


<!-- chunk -->

### They all promote inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also why anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil may reduce the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia. But don’t take them to reduce your risk. Over 100,000 people per year

<!-- chunk -->

### end up in the hospital and 16,000 people die every year from intestinal bleeding

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by these medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone is searching for the one thing that causes diseases like

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. But there is no one thing. Complex interactions between multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### factors from your lifestyle and environment interacting with your genes create

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. We have to address all the factors to succeed in helping the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### become healthy and recover.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like in autism and depression, many cases of dementia and Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### can be slowed and even reversed if all the causes are dealt with. The brain has

<!-- chunk -->

### extraordinary powers of healing and recovery if we provide the right conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the answer is not taking aspirin or Advil! We must deal with the underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### causes of disease—causes like inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is what I did for Christine, and her recovery from early-stage dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### was remarkable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Until her seventies, Christine was mentally sharp, and while still highly

<!-- chunk -->

### intelligent, she noticed increasing trouble with her memory. By the time I saw

<!-- chunk -->

### her at eighty-one her memory was failing. Her ability to live on her own was

<!-- chunk -->

### being questioned by her children, who took her to see a neurologist and

<!-- chunk -->

### psychologist. After extensive neuropsychiatric and memory testing she was told

<!-- chunk -->

### she had early dementia. No treatment was recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her daughter brought her to see me and we found a high level of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation (C-reactive protein), along with a number of other factors that all

<!-- chunk -->

### contributed to this inflammation—low vitamin D; undiagnosed autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid disease; low levels of B

6,

<!-- chunk -->

### folate, and B


<!-- chunk -->

### ; and a high level of mercury and

<!-- chunk -->

### lead.

<!-- chunk -->

### Any one of these factors may not have been enough to cause problems, but

<!-- chunk -->

### added together in the body of an eighty-one-year-old woman, they caused her

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and body to start shutting down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over a period of six months we aggressively treated her with a fresh, whole

<!-- chunk -->

### foods, anti-inflammatory diet, gave her omega-3 fat supplements, and replaced

<!-- chunk -->

### all the vitamins she was missing—vitamins D, B

6,

<!-- chunk -->

### folate, and B

12.

<!-- chunk -->

### We treated her thyroid and helped her gently reduce the level of mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### and lead in her body.

<!-- chunk -->

### After this treatment Christine had her three-hour battery of

<!-- chunk -->

### neuropsychiatric and memory tests repeated, and they all improved .

<!-- chunk -->

### Normally dementia is progressive and—according to conventional wisdom

<!-- chunk -->

### — cannot be reversed. But after cooling inflammation, improving nutrition, and

<!-- chunk -->

### helping her detoxify, Christine regained a lost part of herself.

<!-- chunk -->

### In cases like these, the inflammation itself is caused by something. So let’s

<!-- chunk -->

### have a look at what the major causes of inflammation are.

<!-- chunk -->

### C-REACTIVE PROTEIN

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are concerned about your level of inflammation, I would

<!-- chunk -->

### strongly recommend that you talk to your doctor about testing your levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP is a protein found in the blood and it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### the major marker for inflammation. Its presence is the best indicator we

<!-- chunk -->

### have of a heightened state of inflammation in the brain and body. I give a

<!-- chunk -->

### more extensive list of tests to identify the causes of inflammation in The

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution Companion Guide. Go to www.ultramind.com/guide to

<!-- chunk -->

### download this important information. The more information you have

<!-- chunk -->

### about how inflamed you are, the better position you are in to respond to

<!-- chunk -->

### this condition.

# The Causes of Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### Everything in the body is connected and there are only a few things that

<!-- chunk -->

### cause inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The list is short.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Our inflammatory diet, which consists of enormous amounts of sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### (158 pounds per person per year), refined flours, as well as trans fats and

<!-- chunk -->

### saturated fats.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Food allergens —mostly delayed reactions to food or hidden allergens

<!-- chunk -->

### that lead to “brain allergies” (allergic reactions in the body that cause

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation in the brain).

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Imbalances in digestive function and the gut immune system that produce

<!-- chunk -->

### widespread systemic effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4.Toxins such as mercury and pesticides (and the 85,000 mostly untested

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins in our environment), which have been linked to immune

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction and autoimmune diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Low-grade, hidden, or chronic infections such as HIV-associated

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, syphilis, and Lyme disease, which can cause many

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological and psychiatric “diseases,” or PANDAS that leads to OCD.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6.Stress —emotional or physical, such as trauma.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7.Sedentary lifestyle.

<!-- chunk -->

## 8.Inadequate sleep —fewer than seven hours a night.

<!-- chunk -->

## 9.Nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin C, B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc,

<!-- chunk -->

### and omega-3 fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### The inflammatory markers or cytokines that we see in almost all disease

<!-- chunk -->

### are now being discovered in autism, Alzheimer’s, depression, and so many other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological and psychiatric diseases. But cytokines are just the smoke signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### The real question is what causes the cytokines to send messages of inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### and spread the fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### The few basic causes noted above explain nearly all the complex

<!-- chunk -->

### phenomena of disease we see. They are all connected in one way or another to

<!-- chunk -->

### all the seven keys of UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem in medicine is that most researchers and doctors are like a

<!-- chunk -->

### group of blind men examining an elephant. One feels the leg, another the ears,

<!-- chunk -->

### another the tusks, another the trunk, and another the tail. All have a different

<!-- chunk -->

### story to tell about the nature of the elephant, but they see only one piece. They

<!-- chunk -->

### are all right, and they are also all wrong because they miss the whole picture.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember even within the paradigm of Functional Medicine, inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### is just one (albeit very important) factor. The other six keys outlined in Part II of

<!-- chunk -->

### this book are equally critical.

<!-- chunk -->

### But all of them connect back to the list of problems above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a moment to look at some of the specific ways in which two of

<!-- chunk -->

### these factors (excess sugar in your diet and food allergies) lead to inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain. Keep in mind these are only two of the more important factors that

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to brain inflammation and the problems that can result. There are others, but

<!-- chunk -->

### to cover them all in this book would be impossible. Similar problems result from

<!-- chunk -->

### each of the other issues mentioned above as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### A Sweet Brain Is an Unhappy and Forgetful Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### By far the most important factor in brain aging and inflammation in America

<!-- chunk -->

### is sugar. The sheer flood of sweet things and processed refined foods into our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies is a tidal wave that leaves destruction everywhere we look.

<!-- chunk -->

### As we saw in chapter 7, the insulin triggered by this flood of sugar sets into

<!-- chunk -->

### motion an entire inflammatory parade.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I have already mentioned, Alzheimer’s (which we now know is, at least

<!-- chunk -->

### in part, caused by inflammation) is now being called type 3 diabetes. We know

<!-- chunk -->

### that type 2 diabetics have four times the risk of getting Alzheimer’s. Excess

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar in your diet is linked to brain diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### The inflammation triggered by sugar leaves in its wake a sea of disease

<!-- chunk -->

### beyond the brain—heart disease, obesity, cancer, diabetes, and rapid aging. The

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence is overwhelming and irrefutable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar (or anything that quickly turns to sugar, the “white foods” such as

<!-- chunk -->

### potatoes and pasta) is an enormous stress on the body, triggering a surge in stress

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. If you notice your kids bounce off the

<!-- chunk -->

### walls after a big sugar load, it is because the sugar produced a jolt of adrenaline.

<!-- chunk -->

### The surge of insulin in the body also turns on cellular switches that increase

<!-- chunk -->

### the inflammatory cytokines, just as happens when you have the flu. Except it

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t go away, but persists for decades, doing its damage slowly.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no scientific controversy here. The evidence is in. Sugar causes

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. The insulin-resistant fat cells you pack on when you eat too much

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar produce nasty inflammatory messengers (cytokines) like TNF a and IL-6,

<!-- chunk -->

### spreading their damage to the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, researchers have suggested calling depression “metabolic syndrome

<!-- chunk -->

### Type II” because instead of just having a fat swollen belly, you also get a fat

<!-- chunk -->

### swollen (and depressed) brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### And psychiatrists are starting to treat depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and psychiatric disorders with anti diabetic drugs like Actos!


<!-- chunk -->

### These drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### lower blood sugar, lower insulin, and reduce inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### But sugar is not the only thing that creates inflammation. I want to highlight

<!-- chunk -->

### one more important factor in brain malfunction. Hidden food allergies. This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### much more controversial area.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do You Have Brain Allergies?

<!-- chunk -->

### What is food for some may be poison for others.

TITUS LUCRETIUS CARUS,

<!-- chunk -->

### A.D. first century

<!-- chunk -->

### De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things)

<!-- chunk -->

### Do you have brain fog, trouble focusing, feel brain fatigue, or feel sad or

<!-- chunk -->

### angry after eating? Does fasting or skipping meals make you feel alert, focused,

<!-- chunk -->

### and clear? If so, something you are eating is eating at you. You may be allergic

<!-- chunk -->

### to your food. But what are food allergies, and how do they affect your brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### Allergies are an inflammatory response. When you ingest molecules you

<!-- chunk -->

### are allergic to, your body believes a foreign intruder has entered its midst. Never

<!-- chunk -->

### mind that the molecule may not be truly harmful—it may simply be a food you

<!-- chunk -->

### have eaten—allergies make your body “think” this intruder is out to do you

<!-- chunk -->

### harm.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a result your body sets in motion a host of inflammatory reactions to

<!-- chunk -->

### stop this intruder from harming you. What reactions are set off depend on your

<!-- chunk -->

### individual genetic makeup and can range from mild skin irritation to brain fog to

<!-- chunk -->

### aggressive behavior, anxiety, depression, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Are Food Allergies Anyway?

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two main types of food allergies: acute (or immediate) and

<!-- chunk -->

### delayed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone knows about the acute form (or IgE allergies), because they

<!-- chunk -->

### happen immediately and in a big way. If you eat a peanut and your throat closes,

<!-- chunk -->

### you get hives, and you can’t breathe, you will never eat a peanut again. You

<!-- chunk -->

### know you are allergic to peanuts.

<!-- chunk -->

### But delayed allergies (or IgG allergies) are sneaky. You may eat a piece of

<!-- chunk -->

### bread on Monday and be depressed on Wednesday, or have a piece of cheese

<!-- chunk -->

### today and get a migraine tomorrow. You never make the connection, because

<!-- chunk -->

### you don’t even realize food can have this kind of impact on you.

<!-- chunk -->

### This type of allergy is mostly ignored by conventional medicine. Yet

<!-- chunk -->

### addressing this in my practice is one of the most powerful things I do to help

<!-- chunk -->

### people recover from nearly any problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Allergic diseases of both types (IgE and IgG) are on the rise for many

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are becoming hypersensitive to our environments, perhaps because we

<!-- chunk -->

### live in an oversterilized environment and our immune systems don’t mature

<!-- chunk -->

### properly. Or because we are eating hybridized and genetically modified (GMO)

<!-- chunk -->

### foods full of antibiotics, hormones, pesticides, and additives that were unknown

<!-- chunk -->

### to our immune systems just a generation or two ago.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result?

<!-- chunk -->

### Our immune system becomes unable to recognize friend or foe—to

<!-- chunk -->

### distinguish between foreign molecular invaders we truly need to protect against

<!-- chunk -->

### and the foods we eat or, in some cases, our own cells. In Third World countries

<!-- chunk -->

### where hygiene is poor and infections are common, allergy and autoimmunity are

<!-- chunk -->

### rare.

<!-- chunk -->

### But delayed allergies, more specifically, occur because many of our twenty-

<!-- chunk -->

### first-century habits lead to a breakdown of the normal barrier that protects our

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system from the outside world of foods, bugs, and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### That barrier is our gut. Right under that barrier is 60 percent of your

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system. When the lining of your gut breaks down, your immune system

<!-- chunk -->

### is activated by food particles that it misinterprets as foreign invaders. This sets

<!-- chunk -->

### off a chain reaction leading to inflammation throughout your body, including

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In chapter 9, where I discuss the gut, you will learn more about why the

<!-- chunk -->

### barrier breaks down and how this is linked to so many mood, behavioral, and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### For now, recognize that if that barrier is weakened by a nutrient-poor diet

<!-- chunk -->

### high in sugar and low in fiber, by nutritional deficiencies of zinc and omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### fats, by overuse of antibiotics and hormones, by exposure to environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, and by unprecedented levels of mental and emotional stressors, then the

<!-- chunk -->

### outside environment “leaks” into your body (and your brain) and you develop

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies and systemic immune problems. This is called a leaky gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, much of what we see go wrong in the epidemic of mood and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders is because of a “leaky brain.”

<!-- chunk -->

### This happens when outside influences from our diet and our environment

<!-- chunk -->

### somehow directly or indirectly cause changes in our brain function that we

<!-- chunk -->

### “diagnose” as neurological or psychiatric problems. There is a breakdown in the

<!-- chunk -->

### normal barrier protecting our brain and it then reacts, leading to brain

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. Toxins, small peptides from gluten and dairy, antibodies we make

<!-- chunk -->

### to the foods we eat, or infections and bugs and the cytokines they trigger, all get

<!-- chunk -->

### into our brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is manifested as “brain allergies”—specific responses to the foods you

<!-- chunk -->

### eat that occur inside your brain. These allergies are a little bit like “nasal

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies.” It’s like you have a runny nose inside your brain. But the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### show up as fatigue, memory loss, brain fog, or, in more extreme cases,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anxiety, OCD, autism, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and other “brain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us accept that small amounts of food, pollen, mold, chemicals,

<!-- chunk -->

### dust, or dander can cause inflammatory reactions in our skin, lungs, and

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive system that give us hives, make us cough or wheeze, and give us

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea. But we somehow think our brain is insulated from the inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### triggered by these allergens.

<!-- chunk -->

### We now know differently. Food allergies create a metabolic disorder that

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to a whole host of “mental” symptoms, including fatigue, brain fog,

<!-- chunk -->

### slowed thought processes, irritability, agitation, aggressive behavior, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, schizophrenia, hyperactivity, autism, learning disabilities, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### One study of thirty patients suffering from anxiety, depression, confusion,

<!-- chunk -->

### and trouble concentrating were tested using a placebo-controlled trial to see if

<!-- chunk -->

### food allergies contributed to their problems.


<!-- chunk -->

### Indeed, food allergies lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### severe depression, nervousness, and lack of motivation, brain fog, and anger

<!-- chunk -->

### without cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies have linked eating gluten (the protein found in wheat, barley,

<!-- chunk -->

### rye, spelt, kamut, and oats) to everything from depression


<!-- chunk -->

### to anxiety, from

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia


<!-- chunk -->

### to autism,


<!-- chunk -->

### and even dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### And a recent groundbreaking study showed that children who were

<!-- chunk -->

### overweight and had the beginnings of cholesterol plaques in their arteries all had

<!-- chunk -->

### higher levels of IgG antibodies, which indicate more delayed food allergies and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation than normal-weight children.


<!-- chunk -->

### This remarkable study clearly shows that food allergies can make you fat

<!-- chunk -->

### and trigger inflammation and metabolic syndrome, which we know cause brain

<!-- chunk -->

### injury. Inflammation can be triggered in many other ways, but food allergies are

<!-- chunk -->

### clearly an important one.

<!-- chunk -->

### Like gluten, casein, a protein found in dairy, also has negative effects that

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to mood disorders and altered brain function.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, partially digested dairy and wheat particles (called caseomorphins

<!-- chunk -->

### and gliadomorphins) are found in the urine of severely depressed patients (as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as children with autism and ADHD). These odd proteins change brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function and can lead not only to depression but also psychosis and autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have treated autistic children who begin to speak simply after going on a

<!-- chunk -->

### gluten and casein-free diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you think allergies to food don’t affect your brain like your body, you

<!-- chunk -->

### are sadly mistaken.

<!-- chunk -->

## How Food Allergies Affect Your Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Every part of your body and every cell in your body communicates with

<!-- chunk -->

### every other part of your body and every other cell. Everybody’s talking at the

<!-- chunk -->

### same time. Making sense of all that conversation is called health. Good

<!-- chunk -->

### communication is good health.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a lot of talking going on between your brain, immune system, gut,

<!-- chunk -->

### and hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### We call this the PNEI, or “psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune system.” In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, the gut is called the second brain because it has its own nervous system and

<!-- chunk -->

### many neurotransmitters like the brain. It is through this system that your gut and

<!-- chunk -->

### immune systems talk to your brain. And it governs how food triggers a cascade

<!-- chunk -->

### of events through the body and the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The immune system and the brain have much in common. They are both

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for perceiving or “seeing” our world, and for remembering those

<!-- chunk -->

### perceptions. They sense things and remember things.

<!-- chunk -->

### The nervous system “sees” the big world through our five senses and

<!-- chunk -->

### remembers things in the memory cells (neurons) of the brain. The immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system “sees” the microscopic world of little particles from food, and microbes,

<!-- chunk -->

### pollens, and dust mites, and remembers their unique identity in the immune cells

<!-- chunk -->

### (or lymphocytes). So, you see, they have a very similar job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems arise when the immune system (or the nervous system) overreacts

<!-- chunk -->

### to normally innocuous substances like food proteins or microbes that normally

<!-- chunk -->

### live in harmony with us.

<!-- chunk -->

### Three basic abnormal reactions to foods can trigger brain injury. First, they

<!-- chunk -->

### can trigger inflammation, which in turn inflames the brain. Second, small

<!-- chunk -->

### partially digested food proteins, called peptides, from gluten and casein can act

<!-- chunk -->

### to disturb the normal neurotransmitter function in the brain, and third, they can

<!-- chunk -->

### act as “excitotoxins,” increasing glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter) and

<!-- chunk -->

### creating a chain reaction that overexcites, injures, inflames and ultimately kills

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hence we develop the brain allergies I discussed above. Our immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system overreacts to the foods we eat and our brains are damaged as a result.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hidden food allergies are a major unrecognized epidemic in the twenty-first

<!-- chunk -->

### century. Despite the fact that the immune system and the brain are intimately

<!-- chunk -->

### linked and food has a major impact on your brain and body, most of us

<!-- chunk -->

### (including physicians) don’t make the connection between what we eat and what

<!-- chunk -->

### we feel. In fact, most physicians practicing today don’t acknowledge the

<!-- chunk -->

### critically important role food allergies play in health.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result is that we have an undiagnosed epidemic of people whose lives

<!-- chunk -->

### are affected by low-grade, delayed food sensitivities or allergies. What they eat

<!-- chunk -->

### causes allergic reactions that make them feel badly, but no one is making the

<!-- chunk -->

### connections.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are blood tests that can help you identify problems with food

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies. These can be helpful, but they aren’t always 100 percent accurate and

<!-- chunk -->

### you will have to find a practitioner of Functional Medicine to run them for you

<!-- chunk -->

### —most traditional physicians will, unfortunately, tell you they are a waste of

<!-- chunk -->

### time and money.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or you can take some simple measures on your own to heal from brain

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies. You just have to take away the substances that most often cause

<!-- chunk -->

### allergic reactions for a few weeks and let your immune system cool down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then you can systematically reintroduce these foods to test which ones you

<!-- chunk -->

### are allergic to. This is called an elimination/reintroduction diet. It is a simple,

<!-- chunk -->

### very effective solution for identifying the foods that cause your brain allergies,

<!-- chunk -->

### and it is one of the core components of the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Are the Most Common Food Allergies?

<!-- chunk -->

### So what have I found after years of testing people for IgG allergies and

<!-- chunk -->

### teaching people how to use elimination diets to help them recover from their

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic symptoms and illnesses?

<!-- chunk -->

### While everyone is different and you can become sensitive to many different

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of foods, there are some foods that irritate the immune system more than

<!-- chunk -->

### others. You may have to eliminate all these foods for a few weeks and then

<!-- chunk -->

### reintroduce them one by one to see which affect you adversely. They are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten (wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt, triticale, kamut)

<!-- chunk -->

### Dairy (milk, cheese, butter, yogurt)

<!-- chunk -->

### Corn

<!-- chunk -->

### Eggs

<!-- chunk -->

### Soy

<!-- chunk -->

### Nuts

<!-- chunk -->

### Nightshades (tomatoes, bell peppers, potatoes, eggplant)

<!-- chunk -->

### Citrus

<!-- chunk -->

### Yeast (baker’s yeast, brewer’s yeast, and fermented products like

<!-- chunk -->

### vinegar).

<!-- chunk -->

### A SPECIAL NOTE ON GLUTEN

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with gluten are widely underdiagnosed. The most serious

<!-- chunk -->

### form of allergy to gluten, celiac disease, affects 1 in 100 people or

<!-- chunk -->

### million Americans, most of whom are not diagnosed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Milder forms of gluten sensitivity are even more common, affecting up

<!-- chunk -->

### to one-third of the American population.

<!-- chunk -->

### While there are tests to help you identify this condition, the only way

<!-- chunk -->

### you will know if this is really a problem for you is to eliminate all gluten

<!-- chunk -->

### (wheat, rye, barley, oats, spelt, kamut, triticale) for a short period of time

<!-- chunk -->

### and see how you feel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then eat it again and see what happens. This teaches you better than any

<!-- chunk -->

### test.

<!-- chunk -->

### See www.celiac.com for more information and help identifying hidden

<!-- chunk -->

### sources of gluten.

<!-- chunk -->

### Despite the fact that this epidemic of food allergies is still largely

<!-- chunk -->

### unrecognized by the medical community at large, new research in the prestigious

<!-- chunk -->

### journal Science


<!-- chunk -->

### and in the journal Gut


<!-- chunk -->

### confirms the connection between what

<!-- chunk -->

### you eat and how you feel that is being ignored by the rest of medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dealing with food allergies is essential to creating wellness of mind, body,

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain!

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III I will outline an elimination/reintroduction diet that will help you

<!-- chunk -->

### identify the foods you are allergic to and heal your brain allergies. Because this

<!-- chunk -->

### plan is specifically designed to help you overcome brain disorders, I will focus

<!-- chunk -->

### on the major allergens that lead to brain problems—dairy, gluten, and a few

<!-- chunk -->

### other substances.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are suffering from a brain disorder of any kind, it is likely these

<!-- chunk -->

### substances are a problem for you. Using the elimination program in this book

<!-- chunk -->

### may help you overcome your brain allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, they may not be the only foods you are allergic to. Though in

<!-- chunk -->

### most cases the elimination diet that the UltraMind Solution is based on helps

<!-- chunk -->

### heal brain disorders, there are a small percentage of cases where you may have

<!-- chunk -->

### other allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you get through this program and don’t see all of the results you

<!-- chunk -->

### expect, it may be time for a more radical approach to eliminating food allergens.

<!-- chunk -->

### In that case I would recommend you try The UltraSimple Diet, which offers a

<!-- chunk -->

### more detailed explanation of food sensitivities, how and why we overreact, and a

<!-- chunk -->

### more extended program that tells you how to fix all of your food allergies.

# Cool Off Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is that an unhappy, chaotic, disorganized, disengaged,

<!-- chunk -->

### forgetful brain is an inflamed brain. The trail of scientific clues leads us to a few

<!-- chunk -->

### final common pathways for all illnesses, and inflammation is a key pathway.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doctors of the future will become experts not only in identifying

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation (which we are already becoming increasingly good at), but in

<!-- chunk -->

### navigating to the ultimate causes of that inflammation and putting out the fire

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of just dealing with the smoke.

<!-- chunk -->

### To treat depression, autism, Alzheimer’s, or any disease that affects mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, or the brain, we must learn how to get rid of the causes of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and restore the normal immune balance through the food we eat,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients, exercise, sleep, and stress management.

<!-- chunk -->

### I will teach you specifically how to do this in Part III, where I outline my

<!-- chunk -->

### basic program for optimal brain health. If you have additional problems in this

<!-- chunk -->

### area, you can optimize this key using the strategies outlined in Part IV.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the next chapter you will learn how your gut and brain are connected in

<!-- chunk -->

### surprising ways, and that often the first thing to do to fix your brain is to fix your

<!-- chunk -->

### gut!


# KEY #4: FIX YOUR DIGESTION

<!-- chunk -->

### We all have had gut feelings. And we know what it is to feel something in

<!-- chunk -->

### our gut. In Japan, the gut is viewed as the seat of the mind and soul. A Japanese

<!-- chunk -->

### business mogul was once asked how he knew whether to do a deal, and he

<!-- chunk -->

### replied, “I swallow it, and if it feels good in my belly, I do it.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Your gut has a mind of its own...

<!-- chunk -->

### The “mind” of the gut talks to your brain every day. We are familiar with

<!-- chunk -->

### signals for hunger, or elimination. But a new conversation is being discovered

<!-- chunk -->

### between the gut and the brain, a bidirectional conversation in which the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### speaks to the gut and the gut speaks to the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### We will explore how this conversation has dramatic implications for new

<!-- chunk -->

### ways to cure mental illness and neurodegenerative disease. The gut is the literal

<!-- chunk -->

### and figurative center of our health. If you start by fixing your gut, many things

<!-- chunk -->

### fall into place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is what we will explore:

<!-- chunk -->

### The Second Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### The “second” nervous system in the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### Bad Bugs Below

<!-- chunk -->

### How errant bugs in the gut bug your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Odd Neuropeptides

### Mischievous molecules from the gut—signals gone awry

<!-- chunk -->

### The Gut as the Center of the Immune System

<!-- chunk -->

### A source of inflammation in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### You Are What You Absorb

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutritional deficiencies and the gut (vitamin B

### 3 fats)

<!-- chunk -->

### But before we do, take the quiz below to find out if your inner tube of life is

### I frequently use or have frequently used antibiotics in the past (more

## Scoring Key—Gut

<!-- chunk -->

### Score one point for each box you checked

<!-- chunk -->

### The gut is a snakelike, disgusting, and smelly thing that we hope will

<!-- chunk -->

### silently do its job of digesting, absorbing, and assimilating our food. We trust it

<!-- chunk -->

### will prevent toxins and bacteria from intruding into our systems, while

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating our wastes in a timely and efficient manner without the least

<!-- chunk -->

### awareness on our part. Just do your job, please.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, while the gut is a source of great intelligence, is it is also the

<!-- chunk -->

### source of great mischief for millions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly 70 million people suffer from some form of digestive disorder. More

<!-- chunk -->

### than 6 million diagnostic procedures are done for digestive problems and

<!-- chunk -->

### million people visit the doctor for gut problems every year. Forty percent of all

<!-- chunk -->

### visits to internists are for “functional bowel” disorders such as reflux and

<!-- chunk -->

### irritable bowel syndrome. And the cost for treating digestive disorders is $107

<!-- chunk -->

### billion a year.


<!-- chunk -->

### You would think by now we would have a clear understanding of the causes

<!-- chunk -->

### of irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, diarrhea, reflux, and inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### bowel disease, just a few of the common problems experienced by millions. You

<!-- chunk -->

### would also think we would have developed effective treatments to fix these

<!-- chunk -->

### problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, our understanding and treatments of this highly sophisticated

<!-- chunk -->

### and integral part of our body are still quite primitive despite the explosion of

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific research on what Science magazine called “the inner tube of life.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the last fifteen years of practice and research, I have found the gut to

<!-- chunk -->

### be the source of inestimable suffering. And I have found remarkable discoveries

<!-- chunk -->

### and cures that hold the promise of getting relief not only from common

<!-- chunk -->

### “functional” gastrointestinal symptoms (and most allergic and autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases that originate in the gut) but from everything from depression to autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### to OCD, to ADHD, to dementia and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start our exploration of the inner tube of life by discussing what it

<!-- chunk -->

### does. Then we will review what the research has to say about how gut function is

<!-- chunk -->

### connected to brain function, how the gut is put out of balance, and how you can

<!-- chunk -->

### restore balance to achieve an UltraMind and UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your Gut’s Job: A Day at Work

<!-- chunk -->

### The gut plays a number of remarkable roles in our overall health. Here are

<!-- chunk -->

### just a few of the main jobs:

<!-- chunk -->

### Breaks Down Your Food

<!-- chunk -->

### Breaking down and digesting our food with the help of adequate stomach

<!-- chunk -->

### acid, digestive enzymes, and bile.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lets in the Good Stuff

<!-- chunk -->

### Absorbing only the molecules we need, such as amino acids, fats, sugars,

<!-- chunk -->

### and vitamins and minerals through a one-cell-thick layer barrier to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### us properly nourished.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keeps Out the Bad Stuff

<!-- chunk -->

### While letting in the nutrients essential for life, it must prevent, block, or

<!-- chunk -->

### neutralize nasty toxins, bugs, and chemicals that flow through our inner

<!-- chunk -->

### tube of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Makes Stuff

<!-- chunk -->

### Bacteria that live in your gut (about three pounds’ worth containing five

<!-- chunk -->

### hundred different species) produce vitamins and health-giving molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### that are all part of your gut ecosystem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Protects You

<!-- chunk -->

### Your gut immune system makes up 60 percent of your total immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system and is called the GALT (or gut-associated lymphoid tissue). It lies

<!-- chunk -->

### under that one-cell layer I mentioned above through which nutrients are

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed. Its job is to protect you from illness. When it is in balance, you

<!-- chunk -->

### are well. When it is out of balance, a host of problems can occur,

<!-- chunk -->

### including those discussed in the last chapter as well as others I will

<!-- chunk -->

### outline in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s a lot of work. And it all has to function seamlessly for you to be

<!-- chunk -->

### properly nourished, to have a balanced immune system, and to adequately

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxify.

<!-- chunk -->

### The gut has to be completely in balance for your brain to be in balance. The

<!-- chunk -->

### brain experiences everything that happens in your gut directly through nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system feedback, immune activity, cytokines, and other assorted mischievous

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules made in your gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Despite its critical importance, few people look to the gut as the seat of

<!-- chunk -->

### health and happiness. Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to our broken

<!-- chunk -->

### brains. Who would ever think that problems in your brain originate in your gut?

<!-- chunk -->

### When it comes to the gut, most physicians and scientists miss what is right

<!-- chunk -->

### in front of us, because we are looking for solutions in the wrong place. How

<!-- chunk -->

### could the cure for autism start in the gut? How could depression be rooted in

<!-- chunk -->

### bacterial imbalances in the gut? How could dementia occur from eating wheat?

<!-- chunk -->

### We have no model for seeing this. So we don’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### Luckily, a few revolutionary doctors and scientists are looking at how the

<!-- chunk -->

### gut is connected to the brain. And what they are finding is astonishing.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Brain-Gut Connection:

<!-- chunk -->

## Your Gut Is Your Second Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Michael Gershon, of Columbia University, has called the gut the “second

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.” In fact, your gut has a mind of its own, literally. While it is connected to

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain through an extensive network of wiring and communication systems, it

<!-- chunk -->

### is also the only “organ” besides the brain that has its own nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### We call it the ENS, or enteric (or gut) nervous system, as opposed to the

<!-- chunk -->

### CNS, or central nervous system. The small intestine alone has as many neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### as the spinal cord. Ninety-five percent of the body’s serotonin (remember, that’s

<!-- chunk -->

### the happy mood chemical) is produced by the gut nerve cells, and every class of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters found in the brain is also found in the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### The question is how does this nervous system below interact with the one

<!-- chunk -->

### above?

<!-- chunk -->

### The gut brain actually comes from the same embryonic tissue as the “brain”

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. And it is still connected via the autonomic nervous system— the

<!-- chunk -->

### sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acting completely independently, it has a number of important jobs: it

<!-- chunk -->

### keeps everything moving in the right direction from the top down by

<!-- chunk -->

### coordinating the contraction of muscle cells; it triggers the gut hormones and

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes to be released from cells to promote digestion; it helps keep the blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flowing so that when you absorb your food it can get to where it needs to go, and

<!-- chunk -->

### it controls the immune and inflammatory cells in the gut.


<!-- chunk -->

### All that happens in the background and is communicated back up to your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain via the autonomic nervous system. Think of it as two independent, but

<!-- chunk -->

### interdependent, businesses that must coordinate and communicate but can act

<!-- chunk -->

### independently.

<!-- chunk -->

### But how does this interaction affect us?

<!-- chunk -->

### Nearly everyone has experienced “butterflies” in the stomach, or had

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea under acute stress, or, worse, became incontinent in life-threatening

<!-- chunk -->

### situations. Clearly, we can have a “nervous” stomach because of our thoughts

<!-- chunk -->

### and feelings and external events. But can we have a “nervous” brain (or a

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed or hyperactive or autistic or demented brain) because of mischief

<!-- chunk -->

### originating in the gut—specifically due to problems with digesting food, the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system, or signals that go haywire on the way from our gut-brain, or

<!-- chunk -->

### ENS, to our “brain” brain?

<!-- chunk -->

### In medical training, most doctors think pejoratively of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### “functional bowel” disorders. Doctors see nothing with the tools they use—

<!-- chunk -->

### scopes, X-rays, and scans. No tumors, ulcers, or blockages. Nothing “real.” So

<!-- chunk -->

### these patients are just neurotic people with emotionally triggered symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Right?

<!-- chunk -->

### The evidence is directing us otherwise.

<!-- chunk -->

### The suffering for millions is real. So the question becomes, are these tens of

<!-- chunk -->

### millions of Americans “crazy,” with “psychosomatic symptoms” that lead them

<!-- chunk -->

### to be irritable, anxious, depressed, and obsessed with their digestive system? Or

<!-- chunk -->

### are we missing something?

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, new science is shedding light on this topic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the years I have seen emotional, psychiatric, and behavioral symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### triggered by problems in the gut. One of my patients was a thirty-year-old

<!-- chunk -->

### executive who would experience anxiety and insomnia whenever his irritable

<!-- chunk -->

### bowel would act up. Another was a little boy who would have explosive bouts of

<!-- chunk -->

### anger whenever his stomach was a little “swollen” with gas. Yet another was a

<!-- chunk -->

### woman who found herself free of lifelong depression after a course of antibiotics

<!-- chunk -->

### (metronidazole) we used to clear out bad bacteria from her gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### When psychiatric symptoms are “coincidentally” cleared up with

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics, that gets my attention.


<!-- chunk -->

### How could this happen? An autistic boy I

<!-- chunk -->

### treated actually began to speak after changing his diet and eliminating gluten and

<!-- chunk -->

### dairy, which altered the “information” that went into his gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### These remarkable stories are all evidence of the intimate connection

<!-- chunk -->

### between your gut and your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Doctors often blame a patient’s psychiatric problems for their gut

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. They are “psychosomatic” illnesses created in the brain of people

<!-- chunk -->

### whose anxieties get the best of them.

<!-- chunk -->

### But perhaps, very often, it just may be the other way around. Mischief in

<!-- chunk -->

### the gut causes disturbance in the brain. Fix the gut, and mood, behavior, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition all improve.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many different factors affect gut—and brain—health:

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfriendly bacteria in the gut and other bugs like yeast that produce brain

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fermentation of starches from your diet, which produce gas and toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of ammonia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Odd, partially digested food proteins that interfere with normal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### operations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Activation of the immune system because of digestive imbalances that

<!-- chunk -->

### damage the protective barrier, which normally keeps the outside world

<!-- chunk -->

### from entering through the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why are millions of us having all these gut problems?

<!-- chunk -->

### The answer is that we are not very kind to our gut. We eat a SAD diet

<!-- chunk -->

### (Standard American Diet), which is low in fiber and nutrients and rich in sugar,

<!-- chunk -->

### additives, and chemicals, which changes the ecosystem of our gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are under chronic stress, which damages the normal intestinal barrier

<!-- chunk -->

### and affects the ENS.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our drug culture pushes antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, aspirin, steroids,

<!-- chunk -->

### and acid-blocking medications that all disrupt our gut’s ability to stay in balance

<!-- chunk -->

### and do its job.

<!-- chunk -->

### And we are exposed to toxins such as mercury, which damage our normal

<!-- chunk -->

### gut function.

<!-- chunk -->

### All in all, we live in dangerous digestive times.

<!-- chunk -->

### An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Dr. Henry

<!-- chunk -->

### Lin


<!-- chunk -->

### mapped out a new way of thinking about irritable bowel and the

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological symptoms seen in irritable bowel patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### He turns the current view on its head by saying that bacterial mischief in the

<!-- chunk -->

### small intestine (from bacteria that migrate up from the large intestine into a

<!-- chunk -->

### normally sterile territory) triggers an immune and nervous system response that

<!-- chunk -->

### sends messages back to the brain, which lead to insomnia,


<!-- chunk -->

### “sickness behavior,”

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, depression,


<!-- chunk -->

### and impaired cognitive function.


<!-- chunk -->

### The gut immune system

<!-- chunk -->

### “speaks” to the brain, sending messages of inflammation, which increases levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of CRF (corticotropin releasing factor) in the hypothalamus (which, in turn,

<!-- chunk -->

### increases stress hormones like cortisol),


<!-- chunk -->

### and changes neurotransmitter levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### Your gut is talking to your brain. And when these bacteria are involved, the

<!-- chunk -->

### communication isn’t good.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, bottom line—little bacteria in our gut start a cascade of immune and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological events that stop our brain from doing what it was designed to do

<!-- chunk -->

### and this creates poor connections and communication all around.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is one of the major ways your gut sends signals of ill health to your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain that can manifest themselves as any type of broken brain and many other

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses.

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to discuss how this happens. Let me start by telling you the story of

<!-- chunk -->

### one of my patients, who suffered from this problem.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bugged Out: How Bugs in Your Brain Make You Crazy

<!-- chunk -->

### The most remarkable story of how bugs in the gut can affect your brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### from a woman who came to see me with the typical “whole list” of problems

<!-- chunk -->

### (which is why I call myself a “whole-listic” doctor).

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of her problems started in her gut—she had the usual diagnoses of

<!-- chunk -->

### irritable bowel syndrome with terrible bloating after meals as well as acid

<!-- chunk -->

### reflux, and she also had an autoimmune disease with joint pains and lots of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory symptoms such as allergies and rashes.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also had metabolic syndrome, or prediabetes, thyroid problems, and

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to all these problems, she also suffered from debilitating

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive-compulsive disorder. She was an educated, otherwise well-balanced

<!-- chunk -->

### human being, and there was nothing odd about her on the surface. But she could

<!-- chunk -->

### not pick up anything off her floor or clean or move anything in her house

<!-- chunk -->

### because of this weird obsession— for years!

<!-- chunk -->

### In the ten years before she came to see me, she had become increasingly

<!-- chunk -->

### withdrawn because of her severe fatigue and her frustration and exhaustion from

<!-- chunk -->

### these quirky behaviors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Actually she had been given many “diagnoses” over the years by many

<!-- chunk -->

### different doctors, including depression, anxiety, OCD, and sleep disorder. She

<!-- chunk -->

### also had severe fatigue for many years.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a result, she took many drug cocktails over the years, including Ritalin

<!-- chunk -->

### and Dexedrine—or speed. When I first saw her she was on Provigil (a new drug

<!-- chunk -->

### to wake up the brain), and Depakote, a seizure drug given to OCD and bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### patients, as well as two antidepressants, Celexa and Wellbutrin. She was also on

<!-- chunk -->

### a highly controlled new drug for sleep called Xyrem (which was the knockout

<!-- chunk -->

### date rape drug, or GHB). This was quite a collection of mood stabilizers,

<!-- chunk -->

### uppers, and downers—this woman was a walking pharmacy.

<!-- chunk -->

### We found she was allergic to gluten and dairy and she was making very odd

<!-- chunk -->

### peptides (little proteins) because of poor digestion. These are morphinelike

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins that result from incomplete digestion of casein (from dairy) and gluten

<!-- chunk -->

### (from wheat), which have been linked to many psychiatric disorders, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### autism and ADHD.


<!-- chunk -->

### She also had vitamin D and magnesium deficiency, which can contribute, as

<!-- chunk -->

### you learned in chapter 6, to depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we looked at her gut environment with a stool analysis, we found

<!-- chunk -->

### there weren’t any of the normal healthy bacteria growing, her gut lining was

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed, and some strangers had taken up residence in her gut, including yeasts

<!-- chunk -->

### and odd bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### A gut is a veritable ecosystem—like a rain forest. There are over five

<!-- chunk -->

### hundred species of bacteria living there weighing in at a whopping three pounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is more bacterial DNA in your body than human DNA. All of them need to

<!-- chunk -->

### be in balance and in the right place (mostly in your large intestine) for your gut

<!-- chunk -->

### to function properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are good bugs and bad bugs. The good bugs help digest your food,

<!-- chunk -->

### produce vitamins, control inflammation, boost immune function, and more. The

<!-- chunk -->

### bad bugs produce toxins, ferment starches leading to bloating and gas, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes move into areas of the bowel like the stomach and small intestines

<!-- chunk -->

### where they create terrible mischief. We generally want to get rid of the bad bugs

<!-- chunk -->

### and add more good bugs or probiotics to keep the gut healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### As part of this woman’s gut cleanup, I gave her a new treatment pioneered

<!-- chunk -->

### by Dr. Mark Pimentel, of the University of California at the Los Angeles School

<!-- chunk -->

### of Medicine.


<!-- chunk -->

### A nonabsorbed antibiotic called Xifaxin clears out abnormal

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria in the small bowel. I expected her bloating and even some of her

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory symptoms to clear up by fixing her gut. But I was surprised by

<!-- chunk -->

### what she told me after she took the antibiotic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overnight her OCD disappeared; after years of unsuccessful treatment with

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapy and psychiatric medications, she was suddenly able to clean her

<!-- chunk -->

### entire house and pick up everything off the floor. The lights in her brain had

<!-- chunk -->

### come on for the first time in ten years.

<!-- chunk -->

### A high level of ammonia in her blood caused her OCD. Ammonia is a

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotoxin that excites and damages brain cells and the mitochondria (the site of

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production in all cells—see chapter 11 for more information). Bacteria in

<!-- chunk -->

### the gut produces ammonia, and when the liver can’t detoxify it, or there is just

<!-- chunk -->

### too much, it causes brain damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every physician knows this because since the 1960s doctors have been

<!-- chunk -->

### treating a condition known as “hepatic encephalopathy,”


<!-- chunk -->

### a form of temporary

<!-- chunk -->

### insanity common in patients with liver failure. The brain dysfunction results from

<!-- chunk -->

### too much ammonia and is cured by clearing out the ammonia-producing

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria in the gut with antibiotics. So this idea shouldn’t seem strange to most

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it occurs in many patients—not just those with liver failure.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we rechecked her ammonia level after treatment, it had returned to

<!-- chunk -->

### normal. After a few months, the bacteria came back, and so did her OCD

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, and once again treating the bacteria cured her OCD. The link was

<!-- chunk -->

### clear.

<!-- chunk -->

### And this is just one of many ways abnormal gut bacteria can affect your

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts and cognitive function.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, Pimentel talks about seeing common symptoms like brain fog and

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue in patients with irritable bowel syndrome that clear up when the toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria are cleaned up using the treatment he created. A bloated belly leads to a

<!-- chunk -->

### bloated brain. The symptoms can vary from OCD to depression to anxiety to

<!-- chunk -->

### autism or even psychosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### So what else do we know about how bugs down below affect command

<!-- chunk -->

### central up on top?

<!-- chunk -->

## Bad Bugs Below and Above:

<!-- chunk -->

## Intestinal Bugs and Your Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Beside ammonia, there are also many odd, toxic molecules that are produced

<!-- chunk -->

### by the five hundred species of bugs that make their home in your intestinal tract,

<!-- chunk -->

### populating the surface of your gut, which is a hundred square meters in surface

<!-- chunk -->

### area, but only one cell thick.

<!-- chunk -->

### These good bugs are very busy living in a symbiotic manner with you. You

<!-- chunk -->

### give them a place to live in your gut, and they reciprocate by helping you digest

<!-- chunk -->

### your food, make necessary vitamins (like vitamin K and biotin), detoxify

<!-- chunk -->

### poisons, produce energy for your intestinal cells (butyrate), regulate cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, and keep normal pH balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### They also compete for real estate with bad bugs—parasites, yeast, and

<!-- chunk -->

### toxin-producing bacteria. These bad bugs take over because you took too many

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics or don’t eat enough plant foods with lots of fiber (which the good

<!-- chunk -->

### bugs love to eat) and eat too much sugar (which the bad bugs love even more).

<!-- chunk -->

### Then the whole ecosystem is disrupted, leading to a bigger set of disruptions that

<!-- chunk -->

### alter your mood and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me tell you another story.

<!-- chunk -->

### One spring afternoon, a beautiful little six-year-old girl walked into my

<!-- chunk -->

### office with her mother and sister. On the surface she seemed quite normal, but

<!-- chunk -->

### then the story of her tragic life unfolded.

<!-- chunk -->

### This first-grade student was extraordinarily aggressive with her sister and

<!-- chunk -->

### her peers—kicking, pinching, and hitting them. She threatened to kill herself

<!-- chunk -->

### regularly.

<!-- chunk -->

### She cut her mother and sister out of family pictures. She was anxious,

<!-- chunk -->

### negative, and hopeless. Temper tantrums, mood swings, and attention seeking

<!-- chunk -->

### were regular patterns of behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was also diagnosed with OCD and “perfectionism.”

<!-- chunk -->

### She didn’t make friends at school, and her mother was called daily about

<!-- chunk -->

### her disruptive behavior in class.

<!-- chunk -->

### Genetics might have set her up for problems. One cousin was bipolar and

<!-- chunk -->

### another cousin had Asperger’s, a mild form of autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### She had all the regular childhood immunizations, including diphtheria,

<!-- chunk -->

### pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, hemophilous, varicella, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hepatitis B. She was a very colicky baby, had frequent diaper and vaginal yeast

<!-- chunk -->

### infections as a child, with vaginal and rectal itching (which gives you a pretty

<!-- chunk -->

### strong idea that yeast is hanging around), and had very sensitive skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### And she loved sugar and refined pastries and carbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### While I see children all across the spectrum of mood and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, hers were particularly extreme. So I began my medical detective work.

<!-- chunk -->

### She had no digestive complaints, but I have learned that even if a child or

<!-- chunk -->

### adult doesn’t complain about their gut, mischief can still be brewing. The

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria and yeast literally ferment the sugary, starchy foods in the diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### producing “autointoxication” with alcohol—a by-product of this

<!-- chunk -->

### process.


<!-- chunk -->

### Violent, aggressive behavior so commonly seen in drunks can occur

<!-- chunk -->

### from alcohol produced by yeasts in the gut. I wondered if this little girl had a

<!-- chunk -->

### little auto-brewery in her belly.

<!-- chunk -->

### On my detective hunt I found she was low in magnesium, which can make

<!-- chunk -->

### you pretty irritable, and was deficient in zinc, so important to helping your

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive enzymes break down your food. That may have contributed to why she

<!-- chunk -->

### had those little toxic opiumlike peptides from gluten running around her brain

<!-- chunk -->

### (we will talk more about these in a moment).

<!-- chunk -->

### She also had delayed food allergies (IgG) to wheat, rye, oats, and barley

<!-- chunk -->

### (all gluten-containing grains).

<!-- chunk -->

### And, of course, she had low levels of DHA—the brain-balancing omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### fat.

<!-- chunk -->

### She also had the typical problems with her methylation train—evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### severe B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate deficiency—and major problems with the sulfation

<!-- chunk -->

### train, with low levels of glutathione, the body’s main detoxifier. (We will talk

<!-- chunk -->

### more about the sulfation train and glutathione in chapter 10.)

<!-- chunk -->

### And she had a lot of trouble making enough energy in her cells (see chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### 11 on energy).

<!-- chunk -->

### These problems occur in patterns, because they are all connected. It is not

<!-- chunk -->

### usually one thing. It is almost always everything. But the gut is often at the

<!-- chunk -->

### center of the problem—even if there are no digestive symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most incredible finding in this young girl’s case was the sky-high

<!-- chunk -->

### indicators of overgrowth of bacteria and yeast in her gut. I had never seen levels

<!-- chunk -->

### this high in anyone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just getting her on a gluten-and dairy-free, whole foods, organic diet; some

<!-- chunk -->

### cod liver oil; magnesium; methylation helpers like B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate; a

<!-- chunk -->

### multivitamin; and some probiotics improved her condition.


<!-- chunk -->

### But when I gave her an antibiotic to clear out the bad bugs in her

<!-- chunk -->

### gut,


<!-- chunk -->

### followed by an antifungal, she transformed into a well-behaved little girl.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her aggressiveness, negativity, and hopelessness were gone. Her mother

<!-- chunk -->

### said she used to be punished ten times a day and got into trouble at school every

<!-- chunk -->

### day. All that stopped when we cleared up the bad bugs in her gut and helped her

<!-- chunk -->

### get her flora and gut ecosystem back in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was suffering from “autointoxication,” which leads to crazy behavior.

<!-- chunk -->

### This process of a bug producing toxins that actually modulate brain chemistry is

<!-- chunk -->

### just one way the gut can affect the brain. There are many more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many studies have shown abnormal, toxin-producing flora in children with

<!-- chunk -->

### developmental problems like these.


<!-- chunk -->

### Normal kids have normal flora.

<!-- chunk -->

### While I have been using children with ADHD, behavioral problems, and

<!-- chunk -->

### autism as examples throughout this book, these principles apply to everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### with mood, behavioral, or memory problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, behavioral and psychotherapeutic approaches are also necessary

<!-- chunk -->

### to help manage emotions, beliefs, attitudes, thinking patterns, and poor behavior,

<!-- chunk -->

### but it is much easier to work on yourself if your brain is not in chaos, if signals

<!-- chunk -->

### and communication systems in your brain are not incoherent and unsynchronized

<!-- chunk -->

### by toxins, allergens, infections, nutritional deficiencies, and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### An integrated, comprehensive approach to regain balance is always

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary and often remarkably effective.


<!-- chunk -->

### Treating the gut is almost always one

<!-- chunk -->

### piece of that puzzle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Changing diet and tuning up biochemistry with nutrients have profound

<!-- chunk -->

### effects on brain and behavior. In one study


<!-- chunk -->

### 207 patients with severe, violent

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior disorders were treated with a comprehensive metabolic and

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical systems approach. They were tested, and their problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### metals, methylation, blood sugar, nutrient deficiencies, and gut problems were

<!-- chunk -->

### all corrected.

<!-- chunk -->

### Seventy-six percent of the group actually followed the program. More than

<!-- chunk -->

### 90 percent of the participants significantly reduced violent behavior, and

<!-- chunk -->

### percent had total elimination of their severe behavior problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study should be headline news. But you don’t hear about it, because it

<!-- chunk -->

### is not a new drug or procedure but a simple diet and nutrient-based approach.


<!-- chunk -->

### These simple treatments help restore normal metabolism and biochemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

### Things can go quite awry in the brain when digestion doesn’t work. One

<!-- chunk -->

### possibility is toxic chemicals that are sometimes created when bad bugs get into

<!-- chunk -->

### your gut, as discussed above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Besides diet, new research about peptides—little toxic proteins from

<!-- chunk -->

### partially digested food—give us another clue as to what can go wrong with the

<!-- chunk -->

### communication between your gut and your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Peptides and Your Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Two sisters, nine and seven years old, came into my practice struggling with

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior problems in school, short attention spans, outbursts, tantrums, and

<!-- chunk -->

### multiple medical diagnoses, including bipolar disease and attention deficit

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperactivity disorder. Their doctors prescribed the usual cocktail of stimulants

<!-- chunk -->

### and antidepressants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both had many digestive problems, including food allergies, yeast, and odd

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what was most striking in their case were the high levels of peptides

<!-- chunk -->

### (little proteins) that were produced by lack of adequate digestion of gluten (from

<!-- chunk -->

### wheat) and casein (from dairy).


<!-- chunk -->

### The proteins are called gluteomorphins and

<!-- chunk -->

### caseomorphins, because they affect the morphine or opium receptors in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluteomorphins and caseomorphins are absorbed from the gut and find their

<!-- chunk -->

### way to the brain, causing much mischief, manifesting as mood and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. In the case above, I found out about this problem through a urine

<!-- chunk -->

### analysis. Peptides can be measured in the urine, because after they are absorbed

<!-- chunk -->

### into the body they must be excreted. These funny molecules cause their mischief

<!-- chunk -->

### in one of two ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, they look “foreign,” so the body’s immune system reacts, leading to

<!-- chunk -->

### overall inflammation, which can show up as autoimmunity, autism, ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, or psychosis as you learned in chapter 8.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, peptides leak into the body and brain. Because they are “opium-”

<!-- chunk -->

### or “morphinelike” in nature, these peptides mess up brain function just as heroin

<!-- chunk -->

### or a psychedelic drug would.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the reasons these peptides are created has to do with digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people with weak digestion have low levels of or poorly functioning

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive enzymes. Some of these cases are genetically determined. Toxins such

<!-- chunk -->

### as mercury, which can come from silver dental amalgams or large predatory fish

<!-- chunk -->

### like tuna, inactivate these digestive enzymes. In other instances, the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes are not activated because of low stomach acid, poor pancreatic

<!-- chunk -->

### function, or zinc deficiency (zinc is often needed to turn on these enzymes).

<!-- chunk -->

### One important link between digestive enzymes and peptides is the failure of

<!-- chunk -->

### a particular enzyme called DPP-IV.

21;22

<!-- chunk -->

### This enzyme is important in breaking

<!-- chunk -->

### down foods, particularly gluten and casein. When it malfunctions, these noxious

<!-- chunk -->

### peptides are often created in the gut and end up in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why using special digestive enzymes as part of treatment is so

<!-- chunk -->

### important in helping recovery from autoimmune and inflammatory disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### including inflammation of the brain!

<!-- chunk -->

### For the two little girls above, I connected the dots. When I cleaned up their

<!-- chunk -->

### guts by improving their diet, got rid of food allergens like gluten and casein, and

<!-- chunk -->

### gave them digestive enzymes, not only did their mood and behavior normalize,

<!-- chunk -->

### but those odd little peptides also disappeared from their urine.

23;24

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearing up

<!-- chunk -->

### the gut imbalances, and removing casein and gluten, stopped the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### these mood-and brain-altering peptides. This returned their mood and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### to normal. Remember, everything is connected to everything else in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it isn’t just little kids who have autism and behavioral problems who

<!-- chunk -->

### suffer from these peptides. They have also been linked to depression


<!-- chunk -->

### and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The critical point to understand is that the total load of insults to your

<!-- chunk -->

### system disrupts normal things from happening in the body—things like digesting

<!-- chunk -->

### the food you eat, distinguishing friendly molecules from foreign ones at the

<!-- chunk -->

### interface between you and the outside world (like the one in the gut), and the

<!-- chunk -->

### activation of the gut immune and gut nervous systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### This has broad implications for every type of chronic illness, as well as the

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, attention, behavior, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s disease we see exploding in our culture.

<!-- chunk -->

### Next, I want to tell you about the remarkable discoveries of Dr. Andrew

<!-- chunk -->

### Wakefield in autistic children, because they have implications for all of us who

<!-- chunk -->

### have inflamed guts and inflamed brains.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Gut Immune System and the Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Many medical discoveries are made by accident. Some smart doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### observes something and asks why.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the most part, doctors and scientists have ignored the fact that up to

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of autistic children have intestinal problems, especially big swollen

<!-- chunk -->

### bellies. How can their belly problems destroy their brains, interrupt their

<!-- chunk -->

### language, and lock them in their own private world?

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Wakefield asked why. He happened to notice inflammation (or

<!-- chunk -->

### lymphoid nodular hyperplasia) in the bowels of some children with autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Could this observation be brushed off as coincidence? Dr. Wakefield dug deeper

<!-- chunk -->

### and discovered this is common in autistic children.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a study of 148 children with autism compared to thirty normal controls

<!-- chunk -->

### (children without autism), 90 percent of autistic children showed inflamed

<!-- chunk -->

### bowels on biopsy compared to only 30 percent of controls. This makes me

<!-- chunk -->

### wonder if many nonautistic children have bowel inflammation from poor diet

<!-- chunk -->

### and allergies as well.


<!-- chunk -->

### He also realized that the inflammation was much more severe in autistic

<!-- chunk -->

### children. Food allergens, bacteria, viruses, and toxins (such as mercury) could all

<!-- chunk -->

### be the cause. These same things are the common causes of all disease and create

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance in every key system of the body—toxins, infections, allergens, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### diet, and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## Making Sense of Measles Vaccine Controversy

<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies have linked the live measles virus from vaccinations to an

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed gut. Living measles viruses have been identified in people with

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed guts. How does this happen? And how does it relate to autism?

<!-- chunk -->

### Normally, when you get a vaccine, even with an “inactivated” live virus, it

<!-- chunk -->

### just stimulates the body’s own immune system to create antibodies, which will

<!-- chunk -->

### defend you in the event of a real infection. But sometimes, as in the case of

<!-- chunk -->

### autistic children, their weakened immune systems can’t handle this “inactivated”

<!-- chunk -->

### live virus, and can’t fight it off. So the live virus hangs around in the body

<!-- chunk -->

### creating inflammation on a low-grade level—both in the gut and the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, a study of children with developmental delay found that seventy-

<!-- chunk -->

### five of ninety-one patients with autism and inflamed bowels had live measles

<!-- chunk -->

### virus detected in samples of their intestinal tissues. Only seven of the seventy

<!-- chunk -->

### normal patients (or controls) were found to have the measles virus in their gut.


<!-- chunk -->

### In another study, DNA analysis was performed on the measles strains found

<!-- chunk -->

### in autistic children and compared to nonautistic children with inflamed bowels.

<!-- chunk -->

### The shocking finding was that the DNA of the measles virus in autistic children

<!-- chunk -->

### came from vaccine strains of measles (the ones made specially for vaccines), not

<!-- chunk -->

### wild types (the type of measles virus that comes from a community-acquired

<!-- chunk -->

### infection).


<!-- chunk -->

### This doesn’t mean that all children who get vaccinated have problems, but

<!-- chunk -->

### for some reason autistic children are unable to handle the live measles virus used

<!-- chunk -->

### in immunizations, and it triggers an inflammatory response in the gut as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. These children can’t handle the vaccine (maybe because mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### suppresses their immune system) and then the normally benign live measles

<!-- chunk -->

### virus in the vaccine takes root in the body and sends these kids into an even

<!-- chunk -->

### deeper spiral of brain dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is even more alarming is that vaccine strains of measles virus seem to

<!-- chunk -->

### migrate into the brains of children with autism. That means it may not be only

<!-- chunk -->

### gut-related inflammation that is causing the problems, but the measles virus may

<!-- chunk -->

### take root in the brain itself. How this all happens is not clear, but the trail from

<!-- chunk -->

### vaccine to the gut to the brain is smoking hot. Vaccine measles strains have been

<!-- chunk -->

### isolated from the spinal fluid of autistic children.


<!-- chunk -->

### Large-scale population studies show no connection between MMR or

<!-- chunk -->

### measles vaccine and autism.


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s because in such large populations the effect

<!-- chunk -->

### on children susceptible to MMR is “washed out.” If you study large groups of

<!-- chunk -->

### people, you won’t pick up small effects on genetically or biochemically unique

<!-- chunk -->

### individuals. Looking at the problem using this kind of statistical analysis is

<!-- chunk -->

### unhelpful for treating individual patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oddly, in the major study “disproving” this connection, the authors noted

<!-- chunk -->

### an increase in the diagnosis in the six months after the MMR vaccine but

<!-- chunk -->

### dismissed it as unimportant because “this appeared to be an artifact related to the

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty of defining precisely the onset of symptoms in this disorder.” If your

<!-- chunk -->

### child had autism or autistic behaviors you would know it and you would know

<!-- chunk -->

### when it started! This is yet another example of conventional science seeing what

<!-- chunk -->

### it believes instead of believing what it sees.

<!-- chunk -->

### The vaccine probably affects only a few genetically susceptible children

<!-- chunk -->

### who are biochemical and immunological train wrecks because of toxic overload.

<!-- chunk -->

### The methods of these larger population studies are not designed to ferret out the

<!-- chunk -->

### uniqueness of individuals. If they examine all the genetic subgroups in the

<!-- chunk -->

### population, then there can be meaningful data. If they do intestinal biopsies and

<!-- chunk -->

### spinal fluid examinations on affected and unaffected kids as Dr. Wakefield did,

<!-- chunk -->

### then we may get some meaningful information.

<!-- chunk -->

### But in the absence of that we are duped into a false sense of security by

<!-- chunk -->

### studies that are destined to fail because of how they were designed. You only get

<!-- chunk -->

### the answers to the questions you ask. Don’t ask the right questions and you

<!-- chunk -->

### won’t get clear answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Roger Williams, the author of Biochemical Individuality, said that,

<!-- chunk -->

### “Nutrition [and medicine] is for real people. Statistical humans are of little

<!-- chunk -->

### interest. People are unique. We must treat people with respect to their

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical uniqueness.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine and the model of treatment used in this book offer a

<!-- chunk -->

### method to do that.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to all the potential digestive problems that autistic children face,

<!-- chunk -->

### it also seems they are more susceptible to allergies and gut inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### triggered by certain foods such as gluten and casein.


<!-- chunk -->

### The extreme inflammation in the guts of autistic children contributes to

<!-- chunk -->

### their inflamed brains.(For more specifics on how inflammation in the body leads

<!-- chunk -->

### to inflammation in the brain, see chapter 8.)

<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is that the guts of these genetically susceptible autistic

<!-- chunk -->

### children are damaged for many reasons—live measles vaccinations, toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### metals, overuse of antibiotics, abnormal gut flora, and food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The net result is that their digestion breaks down. Digestive enzymes don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### work properly. Food particles (especially from gluten and dairy) are partially

<!-- chunk -->

### digested and become brain-fogging toxic compounds (like the peptides

<!-- chunk -->

### mentioned above). The immune system in the gut is switched on and activated

<!-- chunk -->

### by toxins, viruses, bacteria, and food allergens, leading to brain inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxic bacteria and yeasts take over, releasing compounds that change normal

<!-- chunk -->

### brain operations. All this overwhelms the system and creates chaos between the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and the gut immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### While this whole discussion on digestive problems in autistic children is

<!-- chunk -->

### interesting, you might wonder how this relates to depression or Alzheimer’s or

<!-- chunk -->

### just feeling a little brain fog.

<!-- chunk -->

### Through the extreme example of autism we can see one end of a spectrum

<!-- chunk -->

### of disorders that affects millions in small and large ways, from full-on psychosis

<!-- chunk -->

### and dementia to mild anxiety and a little depression. Dealing with gut

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation is a back door into healing the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### People who have celiac disease


<!-- chunk -->

### or inflammatory bowel disease are more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to get dementia. And even schizophrenia has been linked to bowel

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and autoimmune response to gluten.


<!-- chunk -->

### Learning what causes brain inflammation and how to heal the gut are

<!-- chunk -->

### central to the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the key causes of this inflammation is food allergy. We covered food

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies in chapter 8, where I discussed inflammation, but they are so connected

<!-- chunk -->

### to gut inflammation specifically and are so important in healing the brain that we

<!-- chunk -->

### need to revisit how damage to the gut leads us to become so allergic—and how

<!-- chunk -->

### to fix it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Allergies Revisited: More Mischievous Molecules

<!-- chunk -->

### Why do we become sensitive or allergic to foods?

<!-- chunk -->

### In the last chapter we learned that food allergies cause inflammation and that

<!-- chunk -->

### this occurs because of imbalances in the gut. So what sends our gut out of

<!-- chunk -->

### balance? Why do we become allergic to the foods we normally should be able to

<!-- chunk -->

### digest easily?

<!-- chunk -->

### All the factors that cause imbalances in the other keys—a poor diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, overuse of medications, environmental toxins, and the rest—

<!-- chunk -->

### damage the surface of our intestinal lining in the small intestine.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will remember that this surface, if laid out flat, would be the size of a

<!-- chunk -->

### tennis court, but it is only one cell layer thick. When this delicate surface is

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged, inflammation spreads throughout the brain and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Damage to this delicate barrier creates a leaky gut (known in medical terms

<!-- chunk -->

### as increased intestinal permeability).

<!-- chunk -->

### Our digestive enzymes reside on this delicate one cell layer of intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. When it is damaged we cannot digest our food properly. Suddenly we have

<!-- chunk -->

### partially digested food particles from normally innocuous foods “leaking” into

<!-- chunk -->

### our bloodstream through the leaky gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since 60 percent of our immune system is located right under that one-cell

<!-- chunk -->

### layer of intestinal cells lining our digestive tract, our bodies react by increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### our immune response and generating inflammation. Our immune system,

<!-- chunk -->

### normally used to seeing fully digested foods (like proteins broken down to

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acids, fats broken down to fatty acids, and carbohydrates broken down to

<!-- chunk -->

### simple sugars), suddenly “sees” foreign (meaning partially digested) proteins.

<!-- chunk -->

### So the immune response does what it is designed to do—attack and defend

<!-- chunk -->

### —and this is how we create antibodies and develop IgG allergies to common

<!-- chunk -->

### foods. This is what makes us sick and fat, toxic and inflamed, depressed and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxious, forgetful and foggy.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is sometimes helpful to get blood tests for IgG allergens and work with a

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor or nutritionist trained in dealing with these delayed and often hidden food

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivities.


<!-- chunk -->

### But following the basic six-week plan in The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### may help you find out if your mood, behavior, attention, or memory problems or

<!-- chunk -->

### other brain fog are related to food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eliminating food allergens from your diet for six weeks, and taking

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive enzymes, zinc, and probiotics can all help repair the damaged intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### lining and bring your digestive system, and your brain, back into balance.

# THE DANGERS OF ACID-BLOCKING DRUGS

<!-- chunk -->

### Are millions of us born with a genetic defect that makes us produce too

<!-- chunk -->

### much stomach acid? And do we need powerful, acid-blocking drugs to

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent heartburn (a condition that has recently been renamed GERD, or

<!-- chunk -->

### gastroesophageal reflux)? Do we have a major evolutionary design flaw?

<!-- chunk -->

### Or is something out of balance?

<!-- chunk -->

### At least 10 percent of Americans have episodes of heartburn every day,

<!-- chunk -->

### and 44 percent have symptoms at least once a month. Overall reflux, or

<!-- chunk -->

### GERD, affects 25 to 35 percent of the United States population.


<!-- chunk -->

### After Lipitor and Plavix (drugs for cholesterol and heart disease), an

<!-- chunk -->

### acid-blocking drug is the third top-selling drug in America’s $252 billion

<!-- chunk -->

### drug market.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, three of the drugs to treat reflux—Nexium,

<!-- chunk -->

### Protonix, and Prevacid—are in the top twenty bestselling drugs and

<!-- chunk -->

### account for $12.1 billion in sales annually!

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem is that these medications have long-term side effects with

<!-- chunk -->

### significant implications for your brain (as well as your gut, immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system, bones, and more).

<!-- chunk -->

### When I was a medical student and these drugs first came on the market,

<!-- chunk -->

### the pharmaceutical representatives warned us how powerful they were. We

<!-- chunk -->

### were told not to use them any longer than six weeks and only for patients

<!-- chunk -->

### with documented ulcers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now they are given like candy to anyone who ate too many hot dogs at a

<!-- chunk -->

### ball game. One drug, Prilosec, whose patent ran out, is currently available

<!-- chunk -->

### without prescription.

<!-- chunk -->

### The funny thing is, when I was a medical student, GERD was not even

<!-- chunk -->

### on the radar as a significant disease. People had heartburn, and then there

<!-- chunk -->

### were people with ulcers. That was it for the most part.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drug companies invent diseases to create markets for their drugs. They

<!-- chunk -->

### attempt to make us think that humans can’t feel good and live with

<!-- chunk -->

### normally functioning digestive tracts without help from powerful drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### with dangerous side effects. This is absurd.

<!-- chunk -->

### The pharmaceutical companies have great commercials showing a

<!-- chunk -->

### family rushing to stop their father from eating a big sausage with fried

<!-- chunk -->

### onions and peppers—and he tells them not to worry because he took his

<!-- chunk -->

### acid-blocking pill!

<!-- chunk -->

### I know someone who used to work for the makers of Pepcid (an acid

<!-- chunk -->

### blocker). When the drug first became available over the counter, teams of

<!-- chunk -->

### drug company representatives would stand at the gates of county fairs and

<!-- chunk -->

### Southern barbecues and hand out free samples!

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at some of the recent research on the dangers of these drugs,

<!-- chunk -->

### and why they cause problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### What do these drugs do that are so bad? Well, their “good” effects—

<!-- chunk -->

### shutting down stomach acid—also have a “bad” effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stomach acid is necessary to digest protein and food, to activate

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive enzymes in your small intestine, to keep bacteria from growing in

<!-- chunk -->

### your small intestine, and to help you absorb important minerals like

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium and magnesium. And it helps you absorb vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### . We now

<!-- chunk -->

### know how all these things are also essential for optimal brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Does the research prove that these things do occur? Absolutely.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking acid-blocking drugs can prevent you from properly digesting

<!-- chunk -->

### your food, cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and lead to irritable

<!-- chunk -->

### bowel syndrome, depression, hip fractures because you cannot absorb

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, studies show that people who take long-term acid-blocking

<!-- chunk -->

### medications can become vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### -deficient, which can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anemia, fatigue, nerve damage, and even dementia, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### in the elderly.


<!-- chunk -->

### Second, research has revealed that taking these drugs can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous overgrowth of bacteria in the intestine called Clostridia, leading

<!-- chunk -->

### to life-threatening infections.


<!-- chunk -->

### For many more people, low-grade

<!-- chunk -->

### overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine leads to bloating, gas,

<!-- chunk -->

### abdominal pain, and diarrhea. (By the way, these are many of the common

<!-- chunk -->

### “side effects” noted in the drug warnings for these drugs.) These side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects can cause irritable bowel syndrome and many other toxic effects,

<!-- chunk -->

### including bad effects on the brain, as we have seen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Acid blockers can occasionally be necessary for short-term use, but if

<!-- chunk -->

### we deal with the causes of digestive imbalance, most of the time, reflux

<!-- chunk -->

### and GERD can be managed without medication.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutritional Deficiencies: Fallout from a Damaged Gut

<!-- chunk -->

### As you learned in chapter 6, nutrients such as the omega-3 fats, magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc, and vitamins D and B


<!-- chunk -->

### are critical for normal operations in the brain and a

<!-- chunk -->

### robust mood and mental functioning. These nutrients also have the most trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### being absorbed when things go wrong in the gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the gut is damaged, inflamed, and filled with nasty bugs that don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### normally belong there; when enzymes are damaged by mercury and other toxins;

<!-- chunk -->

### when you take acid-blocking drugs that lower the essential acid necessary to

<!-- chunk -->

### absorb minerals and vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , it is hard to absorb these essential ingredients

<!-- chunk -->

### for life and be well nourished.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keeping your digestive system healthy is critical for proper brain function,

<!-- chunk -->

### because ultimately you are not only what you eat; you are truly only what you

<!-- chunk -->

### absorb.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fix Your Digestion

<!-- chunk -->

### I imagine this has been an eye-opening chapter, and I recognize that the

<!-- chunk -->

### discoveries I have told you about are mostly off the radar of conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. But not for long. The emerging story from the research is clear. The

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence I have seen in my patients is irrefutable.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a healthy body, our bacterial tenants and our brains are locked in a fine

<!-- chunk -->

### dance. Your “brain” brain is in constant and synchronous communication with

<!-- chunk -->

### your gut brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our gut must tangle with potentially mischievous neuropeptides from

<!-- chunk -->

### omnipresent gluten and dairy in our diet. It must contend with an onslaught of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, allergens, and bugs that interact with our gut immune system with

<!-- chunk -->

### widespread effects on our health and brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it must try to stay nourished all the while to provide the “neuro”

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients necessary for optimal brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is not an easy task, but it is very much within our reach if we

<!-- chunk -->

### understand how our bodies work, what goes wrong, and how to fix it. The road

<!-- chunk -->

### map for this new territory is The UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III and Part IV I will give you the detailed tools and instructions for

<!-- chunk -->

### achieving energy, vitality, happiness, and a sharp, focused, alert mind and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### for life. This is a major part of UltraWellness. One of the keys to unlocking it is

<!-- chunk -->

### learning how to give your gut what it needs to stay in balance and avoid the

<!-- chunk -->

### things that send it into chaos.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you want to eliminate morphinelike molecules that poison your brain, if

<!-- chunk -->

### you want to eliminate the possibility of “autointoxication,” if you want to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### the inflammation in your gut that is setting your brain on fire, the solution is

<!-- chunk -->

### simple: eliminate the dietary and environmental factors that are traumatizing

<!-- chunk -->

### your gut and feed it what it needs so you can live in harmony with it. Later in the

<!-- chunk -->

### book I will show you how.

<!-- chunk -->

### For now let’s turn our attention to toxins, how they affect our brain, and

<!-- chunk -->

### how they lead to systemic breakdown that contributes to almost every brain-and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood-related problem we face.


# KEY #5: ENHANCE

# DETOXIFICATION

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two things most physicians never learn in medical school:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. The role of nutrition and food in health and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. The role of toxins and the importance of detoxification in health and

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### And they are probably the two most important things we need to know to

<!-- chunk -->

### cure disease and create health.

<!-- chunk -->

### In today’s world, food and toxins are more important than ever. The

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional value of our food has been compromised by factors that range from

<!-- chunk -->

### corporate agribusiness, overfarming, and depleting the nutrient levels of the soil

<!-- chunk -->

### to food conglomerates like Kraft, Nestlé, and Nabisco putting highly processed,

<!-- chunk -->

### high-glycemic-load foods on the market that contribute to every health problem

<!-- chunk -->

### we see today, from heart disease to dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The poor nutritional value of our food is further complicated by the

<!-- chunk -->

### extraordinary amounts of toxic chemicals that have entered our food supply and

<!-- chunk -->

### our bodies. Since the 1800s, more than eighty thousand new, largely untested

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals have been introduced into the environment. Today, many are used as

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides to “protect” our food supply.

<!-- chunk -->

### And our exposure to poisonous substances doesn’t end there. Toxins are

<!-- chunk -->

### everywhere—from household cleaning products to plastics in our kitchen-ware,

<!-- chunk -->

### phthalates and bisphenol A in our plastic water bottles, and even in our tap water

<!-- chunk -->

### and air supply.

<!-- chunk -->

### We live in a sea of toxins, and a large body of growing evidence shows that

<!-- chunk -->

### these toxins are, in part, responsible for the epidemic of disease we see in the

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty-first century. Toxic exposures affect the health of all brains, young and

<!-- chunk -->

### old.

<!-- chunk -->

### We must also deal with all the by-products and toxic metabolic wastes

<!-- chunk -->

### created by our own bodies. These self-produced toxins make us sick if our

<!-- chunk -->

### kidneys or livers fail or work at less than optimal levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this chapter we will review the scientific evidence of the dramatic impact

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins have on the health of your brain. I will explain how I came to understand

<!-- chunk -->

### the importance of toxins in health and disease, and I will tell you how you can

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid the toxins that may be making you lose your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### But first, take the quiz below to find out if you are toxic.

### Scoring Key—Toxins


<!-- chunk -->

## A Poisoned Doctor: My Own Brain Failure

<!-- chunk -->

### As you know from Part I, I learned about the importance of toxins and

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification the hard way... in my own life... as a patient.

<!-- chunk -->

### I had a fascination and love for China and the Orient, which probably

<!-- chunk -->

### started because of our regular Sunday dinner trips to Chinese restaurants during

<!-- chunk -->

### my childhood. Little did I know going to China would damage my brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### derail my life.

<!-- chunk -->

### At Cornell, I majored in Asian Studies and studied Mandarin Chinese. I

<!-- chunk -->

### then went on a three-month sojourn through the remotest areas of China in 1984,

<!-- chunk -->

### after my first year of medical school, with the woman who would become my

<!-- chunk -->

### wife.

<!-- chunk -->

### I loved the culture, the people, and the way food is treated as medicine. In

<!-- chunk -->

### China, people “eat” their medicine. The words for “take your medicine” are “chi

<!-- chunk -->

### yao,” which means eat your medicine. Food and healing are intimately

<!-- chunk -->

### connected. In China, food is pharmacology.

<!-- chunk -->

### I returned to China ten years later to live and work in Beijing and develop a

<!-- chunk -->

### medical center. In one decade the landscape had changed from a city of

<!-- chunk -->

### million people wearing Mao suits and riding bicycles to a frenzied, money-

<!-- chunk -->

### chasing city filled with Audi limos, cell phones, high heels, and business suits.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the homes of the 10 million were still heated by raw coal, sending a

<!-- chunk -->

### dark cloud over the city on the brightest winter days. People walked the streets

<!-- chunk -->

### with surgical masks to filter out the black air. At the time, I was unaware that

<!-- chunk -->

### coal burning is the most significant source of mercury emissions. I breathed that

<!-- chunk -->

### air every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the time I knew nothing of mercury, nor had I heard about genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### polymorphisms. But it turns out that I am missing a key gene necessary for the

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification of mercury and many other twenty-first-century poisons, the

<!-- chunk -->

### GSTM1 gene.

<!-- chunk -->

### About half our population is missing this gene. It turns out that it is the sick

<!-- chunk -->

### half!

<!-- chunk -->

### Shortly after I returned home to the beautiful Berkshire mountains of

<!-- chunk -->

### western Massachusetts, I became ill with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

<!-- chunk -->

### How could this happen? Why was I sick? Certainly the stress of sleepless

<!-- chunk -->

### nights working in the emergency room weren’t good for me and getting a severe

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal infection from a lake in Maine didn’t help either, but suddenly I was

<!-- chunk -->

### sick.

<!-- chunk -->

### After I spent a few years searching for the cause of my illness, a colleague

<!-- chunk -->

### mentioned that many people with CFS are toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

### So I checked my hair for mercury. It was high. Perhaps growing up on daily

<!-- chunk -->

### tuna fish sandwiches, receiving multiple immunizations, using contact lens fluid

<!-- chunk -->

### with thimerosal, and my love of sushi all became too much to handle once I

<!-- chunk -->

### inhaled a toxic load of mercury from the cold, dark winter air in Beijing.

<!-- chunk -->

### I took a urine test to see the total mercury load in my body. I used a

<!-- chunk -->

### chelating substance, which binds up metals in the body and carries them out in

<!-- chunk -->

### the urine and stool. “Normal” levels of mercury are less than 3 mcg/g of

<!-- chunk -->

### creatinine. My level was almost 200 mcg/g of creatinine. Anything over

<!-- chunk -->

### mcg/g of creatinine is considered “poisoning.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Through a long learning process, experimentation on myself, and

<!-- chunk -->

### conversations with dozens of experts, I was able to rid my body of mercury

<!-- chunk -->

### using a careful, deliberate detoxification process that included detoxifying foods,

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, intravenous glutathione and vitamin C, metal chelators, and

<!-- chunk -->

### saunas.

<!-- chunk -->

### I also worked on healing my gut by eliminating food allergens and using

<!-- chunk -->

### probiotics and enzymes, but it didn’t get completely better until I got the

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury out of my system.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain fog, depression, insomnia, severe memory deficits, and slowed

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking that are the symptoms of CFS lifted, and I got my brain and my health

<!-- chunk -->

### back.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, this is a story repeated over and over in our society. We live

<!-- chunk -->

### in a sea of toxins—6 million pounds of mercury emissions a year, and 2.5 billion

<!-- chunk -->

### pounds of 80,000 other toxic chemicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### These industrial emissions threaten our health and the health of our planet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Global warming and chronic health problems are triggered by the same

<!-- chunk -->

### emissions. How can these known neurotoxins not affect our brains? How exactly

<!-- chunk -->

### do they harm our brains? What can we do to protect and detoxify ourselves?

<!-- chunk -->

### These are questions that medicine must face and answer. Each person

<!-- chunk -->

### responds differently to toxins. Some are great detoxifiers; others, like me and

<!-- chunk -->

### those with autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and depression, are often

<!-- chunk -->

### not.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at what the research has to say about which toxins affect your

<!-- chunk -->

### health most dramatically. Remember, these are only examples. Every chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### currently in use that has not been tested for toxicity by public health agencies is

<!-- chunk -->

### a potential health threat. Keep in mind that only about 0.6 percent of all

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals now in use have been tested.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a doctor, one of the things that concerns me most is the impact these

<!-- chunk -->

### untested chemicals may have on our health as we age.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mercury and Illness: Demented or Toxic?

<!-- chunk -->

### Few topics are so politically and scientifically charged and have such

<!-- chunk -->

### enormous implications for our health and our economy that we avoid them as the

<!-- chunk -->

### impact of heavy metals (and mercury in particular) on our health.

<!-- chunk -->

### But, like nutrition, poisoning with heavy metals such as mercury and other

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins and the importance of detoxification is not something we learn about in

<!-- chunk -->

### medical school.

<!-- chunk -->

### So we have few tools to address this toxic exposure, which is contributing

<!-- chunk -->

### to many of the health epidemics we see in today’s world. Once we start looking a

<!-- chunk -->

### little deeper, the effects of toxins are not hard to document.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, though, the human organism has an extraordinary capacity for

<!-- chunk -->

### resiliency, regeneration, recovery, and renewal. I have seen this over and over,

<!-- chunk -->

### not only in relation to my own mercury-toxic brain and its recovery, but also in

<!-- chunk -->

### the recovery of so many patients with depression, behavior problems, ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### autism, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, even if you haven’t been treated for toxins you have certainly been

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed to, there is still hope—even in extreme cases. We need to look under the

<!-- chunk -->

### “hood” and see what dirt and poisons we may find, then clean up the metabolic,

<!-- chunk -->

### immunological, and biochemical mess.

<!-- chunk -->

### So how do toxins connect to dementia?

<!-- chunk -->

### Dementia is a “brain disease” that may affect cognitive function, language,

<!-- chunk -->

### attention, memory, personality, and abstract reasoning. In severe forms people’s

<!-- chunk -->

### memories disappear, they forget their history, they stop talking, and their

<!-- chunk -->

### personality evaporates. A terrifying, progressive, irreversible process, dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### does not have a good medical treatment except for toxic medications with many

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects that, at best, may delay entry into a nursing home by a few months.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dementia is a big problem and growing every day. Ten percent of sixty-

<!-- chunk -->

### five-year-olds, 25 percent of seventy-five-year-olds, and 50 percent of eighty-

<!-- chunk -->

### five-year-olds will get Alzheimer’s (which is a form of dementia) at a cost of

<!-- chunk -->

### $60 billion a year to society. Scientists predict that the number of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s will triple in the next few decades. It is now the seventh leading

<!-- chunk -->

### cause of death.


<!-- chunk -->

### And basically the medical community has no solution for it.

<!-- chunk -->

### I was recently speaking on a panel for PBS-TV at the American Association

<!-- chunk -->

### of Retired Persons convention in Boston. The topic was dementia. A woman

<!-- chunk -->

### with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was on the panel—MCI is sort of like

<!-- chunk -->

### pre-Alzheimer’s or predementia—and everyone on the panel (including the

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvard neurologist) agreed that memory loss is not a normal part of aging. But

<!-- chunk -->

### now 22 percent, or 5.4 million people over seventy have “predementia.”


<!-- chunk -->

### The sad part was that the doctors on the panel didn’t have much to offer in

<!-- chunk -->

### the way of prevention—just a very bad and pretty ineffective selection of drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### with many nasty side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there is a way to prevent, treat, and sometimes even reverse the

<!-- chunk -->

### memory loss in dementia. That is where my patient, George, comes in.

<!-- chunk -->

### George had a diagnosis of dementia and came with his wife to see me. He

<!-- chunk -->

### could no longer manage his business affairs, had become increasingly unable to

<!-- chunk -->

### function at home, and had to withdraw from family and social relationships.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was desperate as he felt himself slipping away.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I said above, there is no effective known treatment for dementia. But we

<!-- chunk -->

### do know a lot about what affects brain function and brain aging: our nutrition,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin deficiencies, omega-3 fat deficiencies, inflammation from food,

<!-- chunk -->

### infections and the gut, environmental toxins, stress, exercise, hormonal

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances, and trouble producing energy in our cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### These factors and how they related to George’s genetic background gave

<!-- chunk -->

### me the hints I needed to help him heal.

<!-- chunk -->

## How the Environment Affects Your Genes: George’s Mercury

<!-- chunk -->

## Poisoning

<!-- chunk -->

### Your specific genetic variations set the stage for health or disease, including

<!-- chunk -->

### heart problems or depression, diabetes or dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### When it comes to dementia specifically (and keep in mind this is just an

<!-- chunk -->

### example of how all disease works), many genes have been found to contribute to

<!-- chunk -->

### the condition. Chronic diseases like these are usually multigene disorders. No

<!-- chunk -->

### one gene is responsible, but the interaction between many genes, their variations

<!-- chunk -->

### (or single nucleotide polymorphisms), and the way these genetic variations

<!-- chunk -->

### interact with the environment, can put someone at risk for a chronic disease such

<!-- chunk -->

### as dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why we will never find the gene for Alzheimer’s, or heart disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### or cancer, or autism, or depression. There isn’t one. There are many genes that

<!-- chunk -->

### influence our predisposition to certain systemic imbalances and many others that

<!-- chunk -->

### determine how these systemic imbalances show up in each of us as a “disease.”

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the loaded gun each of us lives with. But we don’t have to pull the

<!-- chunk -->

### trigger. It is our environmental influences (our diet, stress levels, toxic exposure,

<!-- chunk -->

### the amount we exercise, etc.) that do that for us. Even if we are predisposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### certain illnesses, that doesn’t mean we are destined to have them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember:

<!-- chunk -->

### Genes + Environment = Disease

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that many things affect how our genes function—our diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins and minerals, toxins, allergens, infections, stress, lack of sleep,

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even though no long-term studies have been done that look at treating

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia based on genes and environmental influences, there are many scientific

<!-- chunk -->

### threads creating a picture of how and why our brains age and what genes are

<!-- chunk -->

### involved.

# CAN YOU CHANGE YOUR GENES?

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to take a minute to clarify something very important. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### people know you can change your environment to reduce toxins by eating

<!-- chunk -->

### organic food; filtering your water; avoiding mercury-containing fish,

<!-- chunk -->

### vaccines, dental fillings; and more. But most people don’t think you can

<!-- chunk -->

### change your genes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Well, you can.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can’t trade your genes in for new ones (well, at least not yet), but

<!-- chunk -->

### you can change how those genes function. You can change how they work,

<!-- chunk -->

### which ones are turned on or off, and how they control your biochemistry

<!-- chunk -->

### and physiology.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, you influence your genes with every bite of food you eat and

<!-- chunk -->

### every thought you think.

<!-- chunk -->

### So if you are born with genes that predispose you to certain problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### you can work around them, help them do a better job, and prevent disease

<!-- chunk -->

### or health problems. You can boost your ability to detoxify by turning on

<!-- chunk -->

### the right genes and turning off the wrong ones. You can help by giving

<!-- chunk -->

### them everything they need to do a good job, such as the right vitamins and

<!-- chunk -->

### minerals and phytonutrients. For example, eating two cups of kale or

<!-- chunk -->

### cabbage will supercharge your detox system and the genes that control it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Know this: though you may have been dealt a certain genetic hand, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### what you do with that hand that determines the course of your life and your

<!-- chunk -->

### health.

<!-- chunk -->

### For George, whose mind and life were evaporating, I looked deeply into his

<!-- chunk -->

### genes and the biochemistry his genes controlled and found places where we

<!-- chunk -->

### could improve things.

<!-- chunk -->

### He had a gene called apo E4, which is a high-risk gene for Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease,


<!-- chunk -->

### one that also made it hard for him to lower his cholesterol or detoxify

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury from his brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This gene predisposes people to dementia for many reasons. One of them

<!-- chunk -->

### may be that people with this gene cannot easily remove mercury from their

<!-- chunk -->

### brains.


<!-- chunk -->

### This certainly seemed to be the case for George, who had some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### highest levels of mercury poisoning I have ever seen.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your brain can’t detoxify mercury, the mercury accumulates there over

<!-- chunk -->

### a lifetime. This mercury may come from many sources, including vaporization

<!-- chunk -->

### of dental fillings, environmental exposures, tuna fish, or air pollution.


<!-- chunk -->

### Wherever

<!-- chunk -->

### it comes from, the effect can be severe.

<!-- chunk -->

### In one study of 465 patients with chronic mercury toxicity, 32 percent had

<!-- chunk -->

### severe fatigue, 88 percent had memory loss, and almost 30 percent had

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. These symptoms and mercury poisoning were much more common

<!-- chunk -->

### in people with the apo E4 gene. Today about 20 percent of the population has

<!-- chunk -->

### this gene.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news that came out of this study is that removal of amalgam

<!-- chunk -->

### fillings combined with a mercury detoxification program resulted in significant

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom reduction.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, apo E4 was only the beginning of George’s genetic problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some genes are critical for optimal detoxification of metals and other toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most important is the GST gene. George had a version of this gene

<!-- chunk -->

### (glutathione-S-transferase, or GST)


<!-- chunk -->

### that was very inefficient. This gene helps

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the levels of glutathione, the body’s main detoxifier and antioxidant.

<!-- chunk -->

### George’s inefficient GST gene made George accumulate even more toxins over

<!-- chunk -->

### his lifetime.

<!-- chunk -->

### Having the combination of a problem with GST and apo E4 puts people at

<!-- chunk -->

### even more risk for dementia.

8;9

<!-- chunk -->

### In another study, people with an absent GST gene were likely to have much

<!-- chunk -->

### higher levels of mercury in their system.


<!-- chunk -->

### So the interaction between genes and

<!-- chunk -->

### the environment is the problem. People like George aren’t genetically

<!-- chunk -->

### programmed to have dementia, but they are living with a loaded gun, and their

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic environment pulls the trigger.

<!-- chunk -->

### Luckily, we know how to work around these genes that are better adapted to

<!-- chunk -->

### a pollution-free world. We do it with diet, supplements, and other detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### methods.

<!-- chunk -->

### George also had another gene we found through his blood tests called

<!-- chunk -->

### MTHFR,


<!-- chunk -->

### which made him require very high doses of a special kind of folate

<!-- chunk -->

### (MTHF) to lower homocysteine in his blood, which is a substance that is very

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic to the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Again we see problems with methylation show up (I discussed these

<!-- chunk -->

### problems in detail in chapter 6).

<!-- chunk -->

### The very core of nearly all chronic illness is the breakdown in the process

<!-- chunk -->

### of moving around methyl groups (CH3) in the body (the methylation train), and

<!-- chunk -->

### creating the most important detoxifier and antioxidant in our bodies

<!-- chunk -->

### —glutathione (the sulfation train, which I will discuss in detail later in this

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

### Amazingly, these two biochemical cycles are completely tied together. All

<!-- chunk -->

### the biochemical steps along the way have to work in order for you to methylate

<!-- chunk -->

### and to sulfate, which is the process by which your body produces glutathione,

<!-- chunk -->

### the mother of all detoxifiers and antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the glutathione in the body to be produced, you must have enough

<!-- chunk -->

### folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### and the methylation train must run efficiently. As I have said

<!-- chunk -->

### many times, everything is tied together.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 12: Connections between detoxification, oxidative stress, and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### Often problems with these same metabolic pathways show up in very

<!-- chunk -->

### different diseases—such as autism or Alzheimer’s—but the underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanisms are the same: jammed-up biochemistry leads to oxidative stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation common to all psychiatric and neurological illness (and to all other

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases), because these are the final common mechanisms of destruction in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. And they are all connected at the core by a deficiency of glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

### The last gene George had a problem with is called CETP. This gene is

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in cholesterol transport and we know that high cholesterol promotes

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s. People who have a problem with this gene don’t make enough of the

<!-- chunk -->

### HDL, or good cholesterol, to shuttle out the bad cholesterol. We know high

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol leads to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Combine this gene with

<!-- chunk -->

### the apo E4 gene and your risk of dementia goes way up.


<!-- chunk -->

### So George seemed to be a genetic train wreck. Every gene made him in one

<!-- chunk -->

### way or another susceptible to environmental insults from mercury overload,

<!-- chunk -->

### folate, or B


<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency, and elevated cholesterol.

# GENES THAT INFLUENCE BRAIN HEALTH

<!-- chunk -->

### The following are the most important genes for brain function. They

<!-- chunk -->

### not only have an impact on your ability to detoxify, but can affect all seven

<!-- chunk -->

### keys to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that these genes are not static, but are highly influenced

<!-- chunk -->

### by the way we live, the food we eat, our nutritional status, and our level of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity. We can address all these environmental factors and reduce the risk

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly. We can even stop or reverse the effects of toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is what I did for George. But to understand how, you need to know a

<!-- chunk -->

### little more about what George, specifically, was facing.

<!-- chunk -->

### George grew up and lived his life in steel country, so he had long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to coal-burning steel plants. He and I were very much alike in this

<!-- chunk -->

### regard. Coal-burning industrial plants or heating homes with coal is the major

<!-- chunk -->

### source of mercury in the environment—it is the same environmental factor I was

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed to in China that caused me to get chronic fatigue syndrome. George, it

<!-- chunk -->

### turned out, was suffering from severe, chronic mercury poisoning.


<!-- chunk -->

### We found that he had high levels of mercury. After we gave him a test for

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury using DMPS (a heavy-metal binding or chelating agent),* we found he

<!-- chunk -->

### had a level of 350 mcg/g of creatinine. Normal is less than 3. This was one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### highest levels of mercury I had ever seen.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking a blood sample tells you only what is floating around in your blood

<!-- chunk -->

### if you have been breathing polluted air, or eating too much sushi, but a

<!-- chunk -->

### challenge test (sort of like a cardiac-stress test or glucose-tolerance test for

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes) picks up buried problems—in this case mercury. Studies have found

<!-- chunk -->

### that using DMPS increases mercury excretion from 3 to 107-fold.


<!-- chunk -->

### The chelating

<!-- chunk -->

### agents or drugs, DMPS and DMSA, are both used to test for and to treat heavy

<!-- chunk -->

### metal toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just doing one thing wouldn’t help George. So we worked hard to get

<!-- chunk -->

### everything in balance. The most important thing we did was to have his dental

<!-- chunk -->

### fillings


<!-- chunk -->

### removed safely

†

<!-- chunk -->

### and slowly chelate out the mercury. Mercury toxicity

<!-- chunk -->

### was the core of his problem, and solving it would be the core of his solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### We helped him detoxify from this mercury poisoning with foods such as

<!-- chunk -->

### kale, watercress, and cilantro; herbs such as milk thistle; nutrients such as

<!-- chunk -->

### selenium and zinc; and chelating medications that helped him overcome his

<!-- chunk -->

### genetic difficulties getting rid of toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### We lowered his cholesterol with diet, herbs, and exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### We lowered his homocysteine with high doses of folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### to

<!-- chunk -->

### overcome his weak MTHFR gene. And we added an extra, special form of folate

<!-- chunk -->

### called methyl-folate, the active form that bypasses the ineffective gene. After a

<!-- chunk -->

### year of aggressive therapy that was matched to his genes and his own quirky

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical train wrecks—not his diagnosis—he had a remarkable and dramatic

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before I saw him, he could not manage his business, nor did his

<!-- chunk -->

### grandchildren want to be around him. After matching his treatment to his genes,

<!-- chunk -->

### he was again able to function, and his grandchildren loved being with him. His

<!-- chunk -->

### memory improved, he could read and remember what he read, and run his

<!-- chunk -->

### business affairs. He no longer isolated himself at home, but became an engaged

<!-- chunk -->

### member of his family and community.

<!-- chunk -->

### While this area of genetic testing and nutrigenomics (see chapter 2, page 37)

<!-- chunk -->

### is new, and more research is needed to help us refine our understanding, new

<!-- chunk -->

### doors are opening onto an entirely new era of medicine—one that no longer

<!-- chunk -->

### focuses on the disease, but on the person and that individual’s uniqueness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ways that toxins such as mercury affect your health and the methods

<!-- chunk -->

### we now have to heal from toxicity are some of the most exciting possibilities this

<!-- chunk -->

### new science offers. We are swimming in toxins today. It’s astounding that the

<!-- chunk -->

### human body can detoxify from these chemical agents that it was never designed

<!-- chunk -->

### to encounter.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it can, and learning how to do that is one of the keys to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chemicals and Neurodegenerative Illness:

<!-- chunk -->

## Can We Protect Ourselves?

<!-- chunk -->

### The one disease that even conventional doctors now know is irrefutably

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to toxic chemicals is Parkinson’s disease. This first came to light in 1979,

<!-- chunk -->

### when young drug addicts consumed heroin tainted with the toxin MPTP and

<!-- chunk -->

### developed Parkinson’s. Recently Michael J. Fox, Janet Reno, and Muhammad

<!-- chunk -->

### Ali have increased awareness of Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Parkinson’s is a bigger problem than most people think. It affects over a

<!-- chunk -->

### million Americans, costs society $23 billion a year, and is second only to

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s as the most frequent neurodegenerative disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### Though genes influence the risk of getting Parkinson’s, one study of

<!-- chunk -->

### identical twin pairs found that genetic factors do not play a major role in causing

<!-- chunk -->

### typical Parkinson’s disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### Then what causes it?

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the years, even in my relatively small patient population (a few

<!-- chunk -->

### thousand people), the link between my Parkinson’s patients and toxins stares me

<!-- chunk -->

### in the face. My patients with Parkinson’s all had clear, documented, and serious

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic exposures.

<!-- chunk -->

### The owner of a vineyard loved to care for his grapes himself, showering

<!-- chunk -->

### them with the pesticides that he carried in a barrel on his back. He developed

<!-- chunk -->

### rapidly progressive Parkinson’s and died.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or the woman who grew up in a rat-infested apartment in the Bronx and

<!-- chunk -->

### had a phobia about pests. She had her house sprayed with pesticides monthly

<!-- chunk -->

### inside and out for years. And she kept tubs of the toxic and banned pesticide

<!-- chunk -->

### chlordane in her garage. Her Parkinson’s started early, at age fifty-three.

<!-- chunk -->

### And there was the woman who at fifty-one started to have a tremor. Her

<!-- chunk -->

### mouth was full of fillings, and her mercury level was over 300 mcg/g of

<!-- chunk -->

### creatinine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another man was an endurance athlete who swam around Manhattan Island

<!-- chunk -->

### in the polluted Hudson River every year and developed Parkinson’s disease in

<!-- chunk -->

### his early fifties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reams of research confirm this link—exposure to toxins from any source

<!-- chunk -->

### puts you at risk: pesticide exposure; living in a rural farm environment;

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption of well water that contains runoff from all the nearby farms;

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to herbicides; or living close to industrial plants, printing plants, or

<!-- chunk -->

### quarries.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, farmers now wear gas masks, and farming is considered one

<!-- chunk -->

### of the most dangerous occupations.

<!-- chunk -->

### But Parkinson’s is not just a disease of slow-moving feet, or a tremor in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hand, or the lack of ability to show facial expression. Parkinson’s also comes

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression, dementia, hallucinations, and even psychosis, all of which are

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to toxic exposures as well.

19;20

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxins must be excreted through the body’s liver detoxification system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Detoxification happens in two phases, both dependent on different sets of

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes to do the job. As we know, the effectiveness of the enzymes you

<!-- chunk -->

### produce depends on the genes that have the code for that type of enzyme.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 13:Two phases of liver detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### It might be hard to imagine, but nature has given us the remarkable ability

<!-- chunk -->

### to detoxify compounds that were not around at the time humans evolved, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### medications and environmental toxins. Drugs are metabolized or “detoxified” by

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes, which are produced by ancient genes. Some of us are better detoxifiers

<!-- chunk -->

### than others and have an easier time getting rid of drugs and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain of those genes have been linked to Parkinson’s. One particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### worrisome problem is the gene called 2D6, which controls one of the main

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes for detoxifying drugs such as SSRIs (Prozac and Zoloft) and many

<!-- chunk -->

### other common drugs and most pesticides.

<!-- chunk -->

### This gene is slow in 5 to 10 percent of Caucasians. The gene that produces

<!-- chunk -->

### the slow form of 2D6 is the gene more common in patients with Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### So take someone with this gene, expose them to pesticides and

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants, and imagine what might happen.

<!-- chunk -->

### While it is easy to despair about all the toxins we are exposed to from

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides in our food and water, to plastics everywhere we turn, to mercury and

<!-- chunk -->

### lead from coal-burning power plants, there is a new strategy we can use to

<!-- chunk -->

### protect ourselves from these poisonous substances. It is the foundation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some have called this strategy “neuroprotection.”


<!-- chunk -->

### I am all for protecting

<!-- chunk -->

### our neurons, a proactive, optimistic strategy, and have used it successfully in

<!-- chunk -->

### patients all along the spectrum of mood, behavior, and neurodegenerative

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases, including Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Jeffrey Cummings from the department of neurology and psychiatry at

<!-- chunk -->

### UCLA emphasized how important it is for us to focus on prevention and

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification as a deliberate and careful strategy to deal with our current

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemics of brain problems. He explains:

<!-- chunk -->

### Advances in medical and surgical therapies have provided substantial

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in the quality of life of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nevertheless, these approaches are largely directed toward symptom

<!-- chunk -->

### management and eventually must give way to identification of

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental hazards that can be eliminated and raising the level of public

<!-- chunk -->

### health, or to chemo preventive strategies that can be administered to

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed, at-risk, or minimally symptomatic individuals. The therapeutic

<!-- chunk -->

### nihilism traditionally implied in the term “degenerative” is giving way to

<!-- chunk -->

### the dissection of the sequence of the molecular events that lead from the

<!-- chunk -->

### initial trigger to cellular extinction.


<!-- chunk -->

### Wow. So here in the most conservative medical journal, the Journal of the

<!-- chunk -->

### American Medical Association, we have a call to action to eliminate toxins and

<!-- chunk -->

### protect our brains through understanding the underlying causes of cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### breakdown.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another key paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association,

<!-- chunk -->

### called “Neuroprotection in Parkinson Disease,”


<!-- chunk -->

### lays out the exact model we

<!-- chunk -->

### must address to protect ourselves not only from Parkinson’s but all types of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### The basic concept goes like this—

<!-- chunk -->

### Environmental factors interact with susceptible genes to trigger this injury

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain, and at each point of injury there are things we can do to stop or

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse the process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Free radicals from toxins lead to oxidative stress, which damages our

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, the cells’ energy factory (see more on this topic in chapter 11).

<!-- chunk -->

### This leads to overexcitation of cells and inflammation. Ultimately, all this results

<!-- chunk -->

### in cell death and the symptoms we see as mood disorders and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, as well as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### The authors of the study suggest that if we can use antioxidants, energy

<!-- chunk -->

### boosters, and anti-inflammatory treatments along with compounds that reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### the overexcitation (excitotoxicity) of brain cells, which lead to cell death, then

<!-- chunk -->

### we can protect the brain and prevent, stop, or reverse this process.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are exactly the same underlying factors that are the basis of the seven

<!-- chunk -->

### keys of UltraWellness, on which this program is founded.

<!-- chunk -->

### The astounding fact is that changes in brain function can be seen on PET

<!-- chunk -->

### scans decades before the “disease” of Parkinson’s occurs.


<!-- chunk -->

### “Premotor”

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms such as depression, poor cognitive function, and poor sleep often

<!-- chunk -->

### occur years before doctors can make the diagnosis of Parkinson’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### By the time the clinical diagnosis is made, more than 60 percent of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons related to movement (in the substantia nigra, the part of the brain that

<!-- chunk -->

### controls movement and is damaged in Parkinson’s) are degenerated! So waiting

<!-- chunk -->

### till then is very late. The good news is that we can protect the brain. But we must

<!-- chunk -->

### start before all the brains cells are dead.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have applied these concepts over and over in patients with every type of

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, behavior, or degenerative disorder and am often witness to miracles. Not

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone can be helped completely, though many can. Using these tools

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery is often possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### It doesn’t matter if it is mercury or lead or pesticides or any of the other

<!-- chunk -->

### eighty thousand—mostly untested—chemicals that we are exposed to. The end

<!-- chunk -->

### result, one of the final common pathways that leads to illness, is our overloaded

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification system. This occurs in many chronic illnesses such as Parkinson’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, autism, dementia, chronic fatigue, cancer, heart disease, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### and obesity.


<!-- chunk -->

### This process of oxidative stress, inflammation, toxicity, and cell death

<!-- chunk -->

### through injury to the energy system of the body or mitochondria is central to

<!-- chunk -->

### nearly all chronic illness. At the end of the day, our cells die when they lose

<!-- chunk -->

### energy or the ability to make more energy. You will learn more about this in the

<!-- chunk -->

### next chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me tell you two stories of patients with whom I used this method and

<!-- chunk -->

### the remarkable results that occurred. They are wonderful examples of how

<!-- chunk -->

### balancing the seven keys, and enhancing detoxification, can mean the difference

<!-- chunk -->

### between a life of suffering and UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Is Depression a Form of Poisoning?

<!-- chunk -->

### Joanne was a thirty-six-year-old professional woman who came to see me

<!-- chunk -->

### after struggling for years with severe depression, fatigue, weight gain, severe

<!-- chunk -->

### PMS, and fibrocystic breast disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Often, she said, she wanted to “hurt” herself.

<!-- chunk -->

### Her story has many pieces but they all fall into the seven keys. Often when

<!-- chunk -->

### one thing goes wrong, such as detoxification, everything spins out of control. In

<!-- chunk -->

### all the clues she gave me, I found the answer.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was toxic. She was unable to detoxify her hormones, which led to

<!-- chunk -->

### severe premenstrual syndrome, painful breasts, and heavy bleeding—a sign of

<!-- chunk -->

### too much estrogen that couldn’t be properly detoxified and eliminated from the


<!-- chunk -->

### Prozac was prescribed for her for years without much benefit, as was a

<!-- chunk -->

### birth-control pill to “control” her cycles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Joanne complained of being a sugar addict (which fuels the growth of

<!-- chunk -->

### yeast). She also took many antibiotics over the years for chronic sinus

<!-- chunk -->

### congestion (which kills the good bacteria and promotes yeast overgrowth), and

<!-- chunk -->

### had many vaginal yeast infections. (Think yeast in the gut.) No surprise.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was always sick. Her skin was dry, her nails soft, and her hair thinning.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Think thyroid problems.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Her blood work and other tests turned up many other clues.

<!-- chunk -->

### A C-reactive protein blood test that picks up hidden inflammation was very

<!-- chunk -->

### high, with a level of 4.3 mg/L (normal is less than 1 mg/L). (See The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide online for testing details. Go to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide.) Her white blood cell count was low, with a high

<!-- chunk -->

### level of lymphocytes and a low level of neutrophils characteristic of a yeast

<!-- chunk -->

### infection. Her B


<!-- chunk -->

### and folate levels were very low; they are needed to support

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and hormone metabolism. She also had antibodies working against her

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid gland and a “borderline” thyroid level.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most alarming was her extraordinarily high mercury level of 260 mcg/g

<!-- chunk -->

### of creatinine (normal is less than 3 mcg/g of creatinine), accompanied by a

<!-- chunk -->

### mouthful of fillings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although the cause of her depression and many of her problems (including

<!-- chunk -->

### her weight gain) was mercury, we had to clean up all the collateral damage. We

<!-- chunk -->

### have to clean up the whole mess to restore optimum health. Treat the cause, yes,

<!-- chunk -->

### but also help people get relief from all the effects—in Joanne’s case this included

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic sinus infections, yeast problems, PMS, hormonal imbalances, painful

<!-- chunk -->

### cystic breasts, thyroid problems, nutritional deficiencies, and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### So we went to work. We cleaned up the yeast with antifungals (medications

<!-- chunk -->

### used to kill yeast and other fungus in the gut); boosted estrogen detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### with vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , folate, and magnesium; supported her liver detoxification with

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs and essential fats like evening primrose oil, an anti-inflammatory omega-6

<!-- chunk -->

### fat; cleaned up her sinuses with salt water irrigation; and gave her a small dose

<!-- chunk -->

### of bioidentical* thyroid hormone called Armour thyroid (see chapter 7).

<!-- chunk -->

### Then came the job of safely removing her mercury fillings


<!-- chunk -->

### and using

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxifying foods such as broccoli sprouts, watercress, and kale, as well as metal

<!-- chunk -->

### chelators (medications that bind to heavy metals and help you excrete them more

<!-- chunk -->

### easily) to help her detoxify the mercury she had been exposed to. I also gave her

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs, and nutrients to support both methylation and sulfation—the keys to

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification. (I will explain this connection in more detail in a moment.) And

<!-- chunk -->

### she began doing hot yoga and taking infrared saunas, which helped her promote

<!-- chunk -->

### the elimination of toxins through the sweat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Slowly her mercury level started falling—from 260 to 150 to 27 (after her

<!-- chunk -->

### fillings were removed) to 10 mcg/g of creatinine. And, with each reduction, her

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, fatigue, and all her other symptoms got better and better until she

<!-- chunk -->

### was feeling alive again. She also lost forty-two pounds without trying.

<!-- chunk -->

### I wish Joanne were a rare case of the havoc imbalances and toxicity cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately she’s not.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same pattern repeats over and over with a few variations. I see thousands

<!-- chunk -->

### of patients with nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, inflammation, gut

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, toxicity, and energy problems, the roots of all illness. All of these

<!-- chunk -->

### problems are a result of environmental factors over which we have a lot of

<!-- chunk -->

### control.

<!-- chunk -->

### More studies on the neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury are being documented every day.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study


<!-- chunk -->

### found that workers exposed to mercury vapor while making

<!-- chunk -->

### fluorescent lightbulbs experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression, as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as many impairments in memory and motor function.

<!-- chunk -->

### The workers at ground zero on 9/11 were exposed to high levels of toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### metals. In another study,


<!-- chunk -->

### 160 of those workers had eight or more chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, weight gain, high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure, and fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

### After a chelation challenge test with DMSA (an FDA-approved metal

<!-- chunk -->

### chelator), they were found to have high levels of mercury and lead in their urine.

<!-- chunk -->

### After three to four months of detoxification treatment the workers experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### an average of 60 percent reduction in symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury is often at the root of so many problems. But when was the last

<!-- chunk -->

### time your psychiatrist or neurologist checked for heavy metal poisoning before

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribing Prozac?

<!-- chunk -->

### Addressing metal and chemical toxins and all their downstream effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### our biology is essential if we are to address our chronic disease epidemic and the

<!-- chunk -->

### burden of mood, memory, attention, and behavior disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## A Heavy Boy

<!-- chunk -->

### Though the effects of toxins on adults are serious and lead to fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, sleep disorders, cognitive loss, and dementia, the toll on our children

<!-- chunk -->

### is staggering.

<!-- chunk -->

### I believe that an overload of heavy metals in children who are genetically

<!-- chunk -->

### susceptible to their effects is one of the root causes of our epidemic of ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### learning disorders, and autism, not to mention depression, anxiety, and bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. Today, a doctor who takes care of kids at summer camp has to be a

<!-- chunk -->

### psychopharmacologist trained in the dispensing and monitoring of psychoactive

<!-- chunk -->

### cocktails. What is wrong with this picture?

<!-- chunk -->

### One little boy’s story reflects the “heaviness” of the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was a wild child—uncontrollable, violent, unpredictable—in fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### mercurial. At the young age of three his “diagnoses” ranged from severe ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### to bipolar disease, to Asperger’s (a mild form of autism), to oppositional defiant

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder (defiance of authority).

<!-- chunk -->

### His pupils were always dilated like someone in constant pain or danger,

<!-- chunk -->

### and like many children on the autism spectrum, he couldn’t look directly into

<!-- chunk -->

### your eyes.


<!-- chunk -->

### Autistic children look at you sideways, not because they don’t want

<!-- chunk -->

### to look into your eyes, but because they can see better out of the corners of their

<!-- chunk -->

### eyes. This may have to do with the effects of vitamin A and omega-3 fat

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiencies on the retina and the way the proteins (rods and cones) that do the

<!-- chunk -->

### “seeing” are out of alignment in “sick” cell membranes.


<!-- chunk -->

### (Cod liver oil, which

<!-- chunk -->

### contains vitamin A and omega-3 fats, often corrects this “sideways” seeing.)

<!-- chunk -->

### His mother had to use her fingers to remove his feces every day from his

<!-- chunk -->

### rectum, and every night he wet his bed, problems all too common in these

<!-- chunk -->

### children.

<!-- chunk -->

### At social outings to the pool or park, the other parents would chastise his

<!-- chunk -->

### mother. “Can’t you control your kid?” He was asked to leave every type of

<!-- chunk -->

### activity he joined. At school he had to have one-to-one supervision every day,

<!-- chunk -->

### and still couldn’t be controlled. He was kicked out of a special behavioral

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy group for children who couldn’t be in groups, and was not allowed into

<!-- chunk -->

### a special camp for kids who couldn’t be in a regular camp.

<!-- chunk -->

### Aside from starkly autistic children, I had never encountered a more

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult child.

<!-- chunk -->

### It turned out he was weighed down by an extraordinary amount of metals. I

<!-- chunk -->

### have performed over ten thousand tests for heavy metals in my patients. This boy

<!-- chunk -->

### had the highest level of lead I had ever seen and a load of mercury on top of

<!-- chunk -->

### that.

<!-- chunk -->

### His mother had plenty of mercury fillings; he was born at the time of peak

<!-- chunk -->

### immunization schedules, before the thimerosal was removed from vaccines, and

<!-- chunk -->

### he grew up in an urban, industrialized area, where the mercury and lead from

<!-- chunk -->

### emissions ends up in the soil and on the floors of homes. (Perhaps we should be

<!-- chunk -->

### like the Japanese and remove our shoes before entering our homes so we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### track in the pollution from the soil and streets.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Because his genes made him susceptible, he accumulated these poisons

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of naturally detoxifying them.

<!-- chunk -->

### How did he get better?

<!-- chunk -->

### Parents, doctors, and scientists track the benefits of every type of treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### given to autistic children whose parents or doctors are connected to the Autism

<!-- chunk -->

### Research Institute (www.autism.com) and the DAN! group, which work closely

<!-- chunk -->

### together (see the box on page 237 to read about the exciting new discoveries

<!-- chunk -->

### DAN! is making).

<!-- chunk -->

### By far the most beneficial treatment is the detoxification of heavy metals,

<!-- chunk -->

### which unblocks the metabolic and biochemical traffic jams that create problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then immune, gut, and brain function can resynchronize and rebalance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our little boy was “heavy” with metal poisoning. So we slowly chelated out

<!-- chunk -->

### his mercury and lead; fixed his gut; improved his diet; removed the sugar and

<!-- chunk -->

### dairy from his diet; boosted weak metabolic pathways with B


<!-- chunk -->

### , folate, and B


<!-- chunk -->

### ;

<!-- chunk -->

### calmed his nervous system with magnesium; and used zinc


<!-- chunk -->

### to help him digest

<!-- chunk -->

### his food and activate enzymes (called metallothionein) that naturally eliminate

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury and lead.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now he is twelve years old and thriving. He has no aide in school, and he

<!-- chunk -->

### can look you straight in the eye and have a normal conversation. He doesn’t wet

<!-- chunk -->

### his bed and goes to the bathroom normally. When I asked him how he felt after

<!-- chunk -->

### all this treatment with pills and dietary changes, he said, “I feel like my brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### not short-circuiting all the time.”

# DEFEAT AUTISM NOW!

<!-- chunk -->

### A few dedicated parents, scientists, and doctors led by Sidney Baker,

<!-- chunk -->

### M.D., John Pangborn, Ph.D., and the late Bernard Rimland have created a

<!-- chunk -->

### new map for this terrifying territory where we now find ourselves (see

<!-- chunk -->

### www.autism.com). Through their group, the DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!)

<!-- chunk -->

### think tank, their work makes it clear that many children on the autism

<!-- chunk -->

### spectrum, and those with ADHD and even learning difficulties, have

<!-- chunk -->

### become poisoned.


<!-- chunk -->

### Autistic children have low levels of glutathione, the major detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### compound in the body, so they cannot excrete metals. (I will talk more

<!-- chunk -->

### about glutathione in the next section.) Their hair shows low levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury because genetically they can’t excrete it,


<!-- chunk -->

### but higher levels in

<!-- chunk -->

### their baby teeth.


<!-- chunk -->

### But when given a chelation challenge test with DMSA

<!-- chunk -->

### or DMPS, autistic kids have more mercury and other metals than normal

<!-- chunk -->

### children.

# METALS JAM UP OUR CHEMISTRY

<!-- chunk -->

### Mercury and other heavy metals block many metabolic pathways,

<!-- chunk -->

### including those related to building new hemoglobin molecules (oxygen-

<!-- chunk -->

### carrying molecules inside your red blood cells). The biochemical pathway

<!-- chunk -->

### that is damaged by mercury involves something called porphyrins. Studies

<!-- chunk -->

### show that markers of abnormal porphyrins can be found in the urine of

<!-- chunk -->

### patients whose biochemistry is jammed up by toxic metals.


<!-- chunk -->

### Genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### quirkiness in porphyrin metabolism or processing by the body seems to be

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to the development of neurotoxic and neurobehavioral effects from

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury exposure.


<!-- chunk -->

### In addition, having a quirky or “polymorphic” gene for BDNF (brain-

<!-- chunk -->

### derived neurotrophic factor), which we learned is so important in helping

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain repair and heal—BDNF is needed to prevent depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia—significantly increases the risk of mood, cognitive, and motor

<!-- chunk -->

### problems even at very low levels of mercury exposure.

38;39

<!-- chunk -->

### This explains why some of us are more susceptible to heavy metal

<!-- chunk -->

### poisoning than others, and why studies of large populations often show no

<!-- chunk -->

### harmful effects from toxins. If 95 out of 100 children can detoxify metals

<!-- chunk -->

### and are not affected, they are 100 percent fine. But for the 5 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### children who cannot detoxify well, the problem is huge and the effect

<!-- chunk -->

### severe.

<!-- chunk -->

### But remember, it is not just the porphyrin gene, or BDNF gene, or GST

<!-- chunk -->

### gene, or MTFHR gene, or any one of the genes that is a problem. The

<!-- chunk -->

### unique combination of all your genes combined with the toxic environment

<!-- chunk -->

### in which you live makes you sick. Our environmental influences pull the

<!-- chunk -->

### trigger and cause sickness. If you had those genes but lived in a more

<!-- chunk -->

### pristine time without toxins, you would likely not get sick.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each one of us is susceptible. Some of us break down at very low levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of toxicity—like those with autism or Parkinson’s, they are the yellow

<!-- chunk -->

### canaries warning the rest of us that something is wrong with the “air.”

<!-- chunk -->

### But how many of us are just a little more depressed or mentally slow or

<!-- chunk -->

### forgetful or distracted or anxious because we are toxic?

<!-- chunk -->

### We may never know and that is why it is important for all of us to

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce our total exposure to toxins and maximize our body’s own

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification system, which I will show you how to do in Part III of the

<!-- chunk -->

### program.

<!-- chunk -->

## Getting Thoughts and Feelings to Stick: The Secret of Sulfur

<!-- chunk -->

### In chapter 6 I described how the methylation train gets off the tracks and all

<!-- chunk -->

### the collateral damage that occurs. I also briefly explained how the methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### and sulfation trains always run together, intersecting and interacting. Breaks in

<!-- chunk -->

### the tracks anywhere along the line to optimal methylation and sulfation often

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to dramatic and serious consequences, not only for our brains, but for our

<!-- chunk -->

### entire well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s dig a little deeper so you can understand, appreciate, and hopefully act

<!-- chunk -->

### on the information I am about to give you.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is the most important molecule you need to stay healthy and prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### disease? Why have most of you never heard of it? Why is it the secret to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### aging, cancer, heart disease, dementia, and more? Why is it necessary to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### everything from autism to Alzheimer’s? Why are there more than seventy-six

<!-- chunk -->

### thousand medical articles about it yet your doctor doesn’t know how to address

<!-- chunk -->

### the epidemic deficiency of this critical life-giving molecule?

<!-- chunk -->

### What is it?

<!-- chunk -->

### The mother of all antioxidants, the master detoxifier, and the maestro of the

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system is glutathione (pronounced “gloota-thigh-own”), a sticky, smelly

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfur (like a rotten egg, or a sulfur hot springs) molecule that is the ultimate

<!-- chunk -->

### product or destination of the sulfation train. Think of it as a sponge that your

<!-- chunk -->

### body uses to soak up and get rid of toxic molecules. It is the body’s workhorse of

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione needs to be continually rebuilt and replenished from our diet

<!-- chunk -->

### with the help of specific vitamins (B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate), and can only be produced

<!-- chunk -->

### if both the methylation and sulfation cycles, or “trains,” are running on time and

<!-- chunk -->

### at full speed. Any break in that process leads to toxic build-up and more free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals and oxidative stress and more inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body produces its own glutathione.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bad news is that our poor diet, pollution, toxins, medications, stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma, aging, infections, and radiation all deplete your glutathione. Thus

<!-- chunk -->

### depleted, you are susceptible to unrestrained cell disintegration from oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and free radicals, and to infections and cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your liver also gets overloaded and can’t keep up with the need to make

<!-- chunk -->

### more glutathione, making it unable to do its job of detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### In treating chronically ill patients using Functional Medicine for more than

<!-- chunk -->

### ten years, I have found that glutathione deficiency is found in nearly all very ill

<!-- chunk -->

### patients—those with depression, mood disorders, chronic fatigue, heart disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer, chronic infections, autoimmune disease, diabetes, autism, Alzheimer’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s, arthritis, asthma, kidney problems, liver disease, and more.


<!-- chunk -->

### At first I thought that this was just a coincidental finding, but over the years

<!-- chunk -->

### I have come to realize that our ability to produce and maintain a high level of

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione is critical to recovery from nearly all chronic illness, to preventing

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, and for maintaining optimal health and performance. And so have the

<!-- chunk -->

### authors of the seventy-six thousand medical articles on glutathione!

<!-- chunk -->

### So what is glutathione?

<!-- chunk -->

### What does it do for us?

<!-- chunk -->

### How can we get more of it?

<!-- chunk -->

### How is it connected to the methylation and sulfation trains?

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione is a very simple molecule that is produced constantly in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Glutathione is composed of a combination of three simple building blocks

<!-- chunk -->

### of protein or amino acids—cysteine, glycine, and glutamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the secret of its power is the sulfur (SH) chemical groups it contains.

<!-- chunk -->

### This sulfur acts like flypaper and all the bad things in the body stick to it—from

<!-- chunk -->

### free radicals to toxins like mercury and other heavy metals. Think of it as the

<!-- chunk -->

### UPS or FedEx system in your body that packs everything and ships it out in the

<!-- chunk -->

### urine and stool.

<!-- chunk -->

### We make it from foods that contain sulfur—garlic and onions, cruciferous

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables, egg yolks, and most forms of protein. All these contain an amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acid called cysteine, the basic building block of glutathione. Add a few more

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acids like glycine and glutamine and a few vitamins (B


<!-- chunk -->

### , folate), and

<!-- chunk -->

### voilà, the magic of the methylation and sulfation trains pops out a little

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione molecule.

<!-- chunk -->

### Normally glutathione is recycled in the body—except when the toxic load

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes too great (which explains why we are in such trouble now in our

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperpolluted world).

<!-- chunk -->

### In my practice I test the enzymes involved in glutathione production as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as the genes involved in producing enzymes that allow the body to manufacture

<!-- chunk -->

### and recycle glutathione. GSTM1 and GSTP1 are just two of the genes that can

<!-- chunk -->

### be tested for.


<!-- chunk -->

### We all evolved in a time before the eighty thousand toxic industrial

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals were introduced into our world, before electromagnetic radiation was

<!-- chunk -->

### everywhere, and before we polluted our skies, lakes, rivers, oceans, and teeth

<!-- chunk -->

### (with dental amalgams) with mercury and lead.

<!-- chunk -->

### We used to get by with just the basic version of the genetic detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### software encoded in our DNA, which is mediocre at ridding the body of toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### We didn’t need more. But who knew we would be poisoning ourselves and

<!-- chunk -->

### eating a processed, nutrient-depleted diet?

<!-- chunk -->

### So why is glutathione so important?

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione recycles antioxidants. I will discuss antioxidants more in the

<!-- chunk -->

### next chapter. For now you simply need to know that antioxidants are critical for

<!-- chunk -->

### cleaning up free radicals that, when left unchecked, lead to massive cell

<!-- chunk -->

### destruction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dealing with these free radicals is like handing off a hot potato. They get

<!-- chunk -->

### passed around from vitamin C to vitamin E to lipoic acid (which are all

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants in their own right) and then finally to glutathione, which cools them

<!-- chunk -->

### off and recycles the other antioxidants. Then the body can “reduce” or regenerate

<!-- chunk -->

### another protective glutathione molecule. And we are back in business.

<!-- chunk -->

### This antioxidant function is critical. When it doesn’t work well, cells are

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged and cannot produce the energy we need to live (see chapter 11).

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems occur when we are overwhelmed with too much oxidative stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### or too many toxins, or when the methylation or sulfation trains are derailed, or

<!-- chunk -->

### we are not getting enough sulfur in our diet, or enough methylation nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### such as B


<!-- chunk -->

### , folate, and B


<!-- chunk -->

### Then the glutathione becomes depleted, leading us toward some terrible

<!-- chunk -->

### illness. We can no longer protect ourselves against free radicals, and we can’t get

<!-- chunk -->

### rid of toxins that accumulate in our bodies and brains. Then we become sick.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione is also critical in helping your immune system


<!-- chunk -->

### do its job of

<!-- chunk -->

### fighting infections and preventing cancer. Studies show it can even help in the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of AIDS.


<!-- chunk -->

### We need glutathione to reach peak mental and physical function. Research

<!-- chunk -->

### has shown that raised glutathione levels decrease muscle damage, reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery time, increase strength and endurance, and shift metabolism from fat

<!-- chunk -->

### production to muscle development. Oxidative stress and glutathione deficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### have also been connected to dementia, depression, Parkinson’s, autism, and

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are sick or old or just not in shape, you likely have glutathione

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency. The top British medical journal, Lancet, found the highest

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione levels in healthy young people, lower levels in healthy elderly, lower

<!-- chunk -->

### still in sick elderly, and the lowest of all in the hospitalized elderly.


<!-- chunk -->

### Keeping yourself healthy, optimizing brain function, treating mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain disorders, boosting your performance, preventing disease, and aging well

<!-- chunk -->

### all depend on keeping your glutathione levels high.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione is responsible for keeping many of the keys to UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### (which are the basis of the UltraMind Solution) optimized. It is critical for

<!-- chunk -->

### immune function and controlling inflammation; it is the master detoxifier, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the main antioxidant, protecting our cells and making our energy metabolism run

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutathione is the center of good health because it is the key to protecting us

<!-- chunk -->

### against oxidation, controlling inflammation, and getting rid of toxins. When

<!-- chunk -->

### those systems break down, disease results.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, we can easily boost our own glutathione production.

<!-- chunk -->

### First you must get the methylation train running properly, because if it

<!-- chunk -->

### stalls, so does the sulfation train. Sometimes you can take glutathione itself, or

<!-- chunk -->

### the compounds that help your body make more glutathione, such as NAC (n-

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcysteine), alpha lipoic acid, or milk thistle.

<!-- chunk -->

### But you can also eat your way out of trouble. Using phytonutrient “super

<!-- chunk -->

### foods” from a plant-based diet should be the foundation for everyone’s diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Broccoli sprouts are the biggest inducers of glutathione production, but you

<!-- chunk -->

### can load up on all the members of the broccoli family daily. Take your pick:

<!-- chunk -->

### collards, kale, cabbage, kohlrabi, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnips, bok choy,

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese cabbage, arugula, horseradish, radish, wasabi, and watercress.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part IV I will give you a specific program for boosting glutathione. I will

<!-- chunk -->

### also teach you how to detoxify and boost your own detoxification system. This

<!-- chunk -->

### promises to protect you from the deadly toxins that infiltrate our lives more and

<!-- chunk -->

### more every day and cause the epidemic of brain disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if you suffer from little more than a bad mood, detoxification can

<!-- chunk -->

### help. If you are coping with a chronic illness (whether physical or mental), it is

<!-- chunk -->

### an absolutely critical step on the path to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Enhance Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly we must face the enormity of our addiction to “modern” life, which

<!-- chunk -->

### is dependent on energy, coal burning, and industrialization, and has dumped

<!-- chunk -->

### billions of pounds of metals and toxins into our environment.

<!-- chunk -->

### This poison echoes across the brains of the very young with autism and

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD, the very old with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and the rest of us with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ferreting out the toxins, making different choices, cleaning up our lives,

<!-- chunk -->

### going “green,” filtering our water, eating organically, and learning how to

<!-- chunk -->

### optimize the body’s own detoxification system are essential if we are to regain

<!-- chunk -->

### our health and reduce our impact on the planet and all its inhabitants.

<!-- chunk -->

### I remember an old saying from the 1970s: think globally, act locally. The

<!-- chunk -->

### time has never been riper for each of us to be actively engaged.

<!-- chunk -->

### That starts with your own health and the environment you occupy. I will

<!-- chunk -->

### teach you some steps on how to detoxify your body, your diet, your home, and

<!-- chunk -->

### your life in Parts III and IV. I strongly encourage you to follow those steps and

<!-- chunk -->

### become actively engaged in detoxifying our world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Next we will learn about why conserving and making energy is so

<!-- chunk -->

### important to your brain and what can go wrong. You will learn how all these

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, bugs, poor nutrition, hormonal imbalance, and inflammation ultimately

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to cell destruction and death by a common mechanism, literally depleting us

<!-- chunk -->

### of our life energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Making energy from food and oxygen to run all our cells is essential to life.

<!-- chunk -->

### And the system that does that for us—the mitochondria—is very sensitive to

<!-- chunk -->

### injury. If you want more energy and you want to learn how to protect your brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### read on.


# KEY #6: BOOST ENERGY METABOLISM


<!-- chunk -->

### Ultimately everything comes down to energy. We need it, we want it, we lose

<!-- chunk -->

### it, and we try to get it back until finally we can’t make energy anymore. That’s

<!-- chunk -->

### called death!

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us don’t think much about where our energy comes from, why

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes we have more or less of it, how it might affect our brain, or even the

<!-- chunk -->

### whole process of aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### But in fact, everything we have explored in the first five keys influences our

<!-- chunk -->

### health directly through energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Enough energy means a happy, healthy, focused, and sharp brain. Lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### energy means slowed mental function, autism, mood disorders like depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### and ultimately Parkinson’s and dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### The part of your body that uses the most energy is your brain, which has the

<!-- chunk -->

### most mitochondria, the little factories inside your cells that produce energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy is necessary for memory, learning, and the whole information flow inside

<!-- chunk -->

### you that creates the synchronous, harmonious firing of neurons and brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### No energy = abnormal cell function and cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Abnormal cell function and cell death = chronic illness and brain disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Is this is why your brain is broken? Take the following quiz to see if your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are damaged and you are losing energy.

## Scoring Key—Energy Loss

<!-- chunk -->

## Score one point for each box you checked.

<!-- chunk -->

## Want More Energy? Heal Your Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### To understand how energy is produced and how its production affects your

<!-- chunk -->

### mind, mood, and behavior (not to mention your health and your weight), we

<!-- chunk -->

### must start with the energy-producing factories inside your cells—your


<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that take the calories you consume,

<!-- chunk -->

### combine them with oxygen, and turn this mixture into energy used to run

<!-- chunk -->

### everything in your body. A single cell may have anywhere from two hundred to

<!-- chunk -->

### two thousand or more mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 14: Inside a mitochondrion

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are built to convert calories and oxygen into energy the body

<!-- chunk -->

### can use—ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Our cells contain a total of one hundred

<!-- chunk -->

### thousand trillion mitochondria, which consume 90 percent of our oxygen intake.

<!-- chunk -->

### This oxygen is necessary to burn the calories we eat in food. But free radicals are

<!-- chunk -->

### produced as a by-product of this combustion, much like exhaust that comes out

<!-- chunk -->

### of the tail pipe of your car.

<!-- chunk -->

### These free radicals are dangerous because they damage or oxidize

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules and cells throughout the body. This damage is called oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### More damaged cells equals more oxidative stress or “rusting”—which is

<!-- chunk -->

### essentially what oxidative stress is. This, in turn, leads to damaged DNA,

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged cell membranes, rancid or oxidized cholesterol (which is what truly

<!-- chunk -->

### makes cholesterol harmful), stiff arteries that look like rusty pipes, wrinkles, and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain damage. Oxidative stress is a central feature in dementia


<!-- chunk -->

### as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### autism.


<!-- chunk -->

### We have our own built-in antioxidant factories that produce molecules,

<!-- chunk -->

### whose job it is to seek out free radicals and clean them up before they rust our

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies. But these systems are easily overwhelmed by a toxic, low-nutrient, high-

<!-- chunk -->

### calorie diet like the ones most Americans eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### We can get even more of these important antioxidant molecules if we eat

<!-- chunk -->

### the right foods. But we don’t, so we aren’t getting them that way either.

<!-- chunk -->

### This problem is further complicated because the critical antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes we make (called superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione

<!-- chunk -->

### peroxidase, which helps the body use glutathione to protect you) are dependent

<!-- chunk -->

### on essential dietary nutrients to help them work well. These include zinc, copper,

<!-- chunk -->

### manganese, vitamin C, and selenium.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are in trouble with free radicals for two reasons.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, the typical American diet is one that causes an escalation in free

<!-- chunk -->

### radicals because it has too many empty calories and not enough antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, our reduced nutrient intake (vitamins and minerals) limits the

<!-- chunk -->

### ability of our antioxidant enzymes to function. For example, without enough

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc or selenium, these enzymes can’t do their job.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s why our self-manufactured antioxidants are not enough to protect us.

<!-- chunk -->

### The single most important controllable factor regulating the oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body is your diet. Eating too many calories and not enough antioxidants

<!-- chunk -->

### from colorful plant foods results in the production of too many free radicals,

<!-- chunk -->

### wreaking havoc on our bodies and our minds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s why.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are exquisitely sensitive to our nutrient-deficient, highly

<!-- chunk -->

### processed, sugar-laden, omega-3 fat–deficient, excitotoxin-rich (MSG,

<!-- chunk -->

### aspartame) diets. They bear the brunt of our nutritional deficiencies. Empty,

<!-- chunk -->

### high-calorie, refined, and processed diets that lack nature’s colorful plant-based

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants set the stage for trouble.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are also extremely sensitive to inflammation and toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### damage. I have shown in previous chapters how critical diet is in regards to

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### The combinations of these insults lead to more oxidative stress (or rusting)

<!-- chunk -->

### than your body can handle. As a result, your mitochondria literally rust and stop,

<!-- chunk -->

### just like a rusty wheel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Colorful plant pigments—the dark green, yellow, red, orange, blue, and

<!-- chunk -->

### purple colors in our diet—are our major source of antioxidants. For example,

<!-- chunk -->

### blueberries, red grapes, sweet potatoes, and collard greens—the “rainbow diet.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Your mitochondria depend on all your antioxidant defenses being

<!-- chunk -->

### optimized. If you don’t eat this rainbow diet, your defenses are not at their best.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result is that your mitochondria are injured by the very free radicals they

<!-- chunk -->

### produce as a by-product of their energy production, and they stop making

<!-- chunk -->

### enough energy for your cells to operate optimally. Then you get sick and

<!-- chunk -->

### ultimately die.

<!-- chunk -->

### The energy assembly line depends on many steps to produce the little

<!-- chunk -->

### packets of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) that run every single cell

<!-- chunk -->

### in your body. And every step depends on vitamins and minerals and special

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients such as camitine, NADH, lipoic acid, and coenzyme Q10.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you don’t get enough of these vitamins and minerals, your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria have a much more difficult time producing energy, compounding

<!-- chunk -->

### the problem they face from the onslaught of ever more free radicals.

<!-- chunk -->

### The result is that they produce less energy and all of the processes in your

<!-- chunk -->

### body slow down. Your brain cells fire more slowly, your metabolism slows, and

<!-- chunk -->

### your ability to process toxins shuts down, to name just a few. Every function in

<!-- chunk -->

### your body would eventually cease if you stopped producing enough energy to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep it functioning.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is what aging ultimately is—the slow destruction and damage to our

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria that result from nutritional deficiencies, low levels of antioxidants,

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to toxins, allergens, infections, and stress. In short, imbalances in any

<!-- chunk -->

### of the keys to UltraWellness cause problems by damaging the mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t eat enough healthy fats, you can’t build fluid, flexible,

<!-- chunk -->

### functional mitochondrial membranes, which keep your mitochondria healthy and

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent them from dying.


<!-- chunk -->

### If you are deficient in the B vitamins or magnesium or other key nutrients,

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production slows down.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the methylation and sulfation trains slow down, free radicals and

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress increase because you don’t have enough glutathione to protect

<!-- chunk -->

### yourself, and homocysteine (which is a toxic molecule in high amounts)

<!-- chunk -->

### increases, which creates even more oxidative stress. The result? Energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production slows, or worse, your cells die.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your hormones are out of balance,


<!-- chunk -->

### including high cortisol from too much

<!-- chunk -->

### stress,


<!-- chunk -->

### or your thyroid function is slow,


<!-- chunk -->

### your mitochondria slow way down. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you have inflammation


<!-- chunk -->

### from any source, including the gut, you damage

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. Toxins


<!-- chunk -->

### of any kind do their damage, ultimately, by poisoning the


<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the day, loss of function or death of mitochondria accounts for

<!-- chunk -->

### much of what we see in most diseases—including problems with mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, attention, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking a journey through the scientific literature makes it clear that all these

<!-- chunk -->

### factors lead to oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury as the final common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathways of illness and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Evidence links autism,

10;11

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s,


<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s,

13;14

<!-- chunk -->

### depression,


<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disease,


<!-- chunk -->

### and brain aging


<!-- chunk -->

### in general to mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### injury from oxidative stress, which can be triggered by poor diet, toxins,

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, allergens, hormonal imbalances, altered gut function, and stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### This may sound far-fetched. How can this all be connected?

<!-- chunk -->

### I will answer this question over the course of this chapter. However, trust

<!-- chunk -->

### me when I say that the research on oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury

<!-- chunk -->

### bears this out.

<!-- chunk -->

### While most researchers work quietly in their labs sorting out all the pieces

<!-- chunk -->

### of the puzzle of human suffering, a few take a step back and ask, “What are the

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns, themes, and principles that link everything together?”

<!-- chunk -->

### What these men and women have begun to realize is that there are a few

<!-- chunk -->

### unifying themes of disease that most scientists and doctors have come to accept.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### Oxidative stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial injury

<!-- chunk -->

### There are only so many ways the body can say “ouch” when insulted. And

<!-- chunk -->

### the final common pathway for most conditions is oxidative stress, mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### damage, and the resultant loss of energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why so many “neuroprotective” strategies are under investigation

<!-- chunk -->

### and have shown promise, including lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, coenzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### Q10, and NADH. All help repair the damage to your mitochondria—damage

<!-- chunk -->

### from any source—and protect your “neurons.” The result is improved brain


<!-- chunk -->

### Neuroprotective strategies like these can be important (and supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### is often a critical part of healing), but even when these methods are used they are

<!-- chunk -->

### often used late in the game (when the damage is already done), and they don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### address the real core of the problem. Sure, if you have a tack stuck in your foot

<!-- chunk -->

### you can take a lot of aspirin, but the real treatment is taking out the tack. You

<!-- chunk -->

### have to work at both ends: find the cause and fix the collateral damage. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### have been poisoned by mercury, you must get rid of the mercury and support and

<!-- chunk -->

### protect your mitochondria with nutrients and antioxidants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Similarly, you can give supplements and medications that boost

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function, but the treatment is removing the substances that lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### damage in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since your mitochondria are so sensitive and can be damaged so easily,

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress can come from anywhere—mercury poisoning, nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency, hormonal imbalance, or inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The key is finding the cause and eliminating it. If you are mercury toxic,

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroprotective strategies will take you only so far. The treatment is to get rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### the mercury. The same is true for the other imbalances that cause mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### distress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at some of the key factors that lead to oxidative stress and the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain problems it brings. This will give you the power to treat the problem, not

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms. You can remove the “tack” that is making you crazy, depressed,

<!-- chunk -->

### and forgetful.

## Scoring Key—Oxidative Stress†


<!-- chunk -->

### As I have already said, many imbalances can lead to oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everything from nutritional imbalance to environmental toxins can contribute to

<!-- chunk -->

### this problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, there are a few primary biochemical factors that are linked to the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial destruction that lead to so many brain diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### I would like to review a few of these here. These are examples of some of

<!-- chunk -->

### the key elements that push this key system out of balance. There are others. But

<!-- chunk -->

### these examples give a powerful explanation of the relationship between

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress, reduced energy production, and the brain problems that result.

# Balancing the Brain: Don’t Get Too Excited

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of the metabolic mischief that damages our energy-producing system

<!-- chunk -->

### occurs by the overactivation of something called the NMDA receptor


<!-- chunk -->

### (the site

<!-- chunk -->

### of action for a new Alzheimer’s drug called Namenda).

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of NMDA as the on and off switch for your cells. All systems in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body have a way of staying in perfect balance. Just like Goldilocks and her

<!-- chunk -->

### porridge—not too hot and not too cold, but just right. In the same way you want

<!-- chunk -->

### to excite your brain cells so they can learn, remember, and focus, but you don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### want to overexcite them so that you become hyperactive and can’t retain any

<!-- chunk -->

### information. Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.

<!-- chunk -->

### The balance in the brain is tightly regulated. A little excitement is good. Too

<!-- chunk -->

### much sends the cells into a death spiral. When the NMDA receptor is “excited”

<!-- chunk -->

### it opens a “gate,” flooding cells with too much calcium.


<!-- chunk -->

### The overload of

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium triggers a cascade of signals that produce free radicals, damage the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, and ultimately lead to cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many things—toxic foods such as aspartame and MSG, environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, infections, allergens, and even psychological stress—can trigger this

<!-- chunk -->

### overexcitement and stimulate the NMDA receptors to open the floodgates,

<!-- chunk -->

### damaging and killing brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### The trick is keeping the balance. Not too much stimulation of the NMDA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, not too little.

<!-- chunk -->

### The wondrous thing about the body is that it has so many systems to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain balance, like yin and yang. All of them are necessary, but balance is the

<!-- chunk -->

### key. Just think of pH balance, or blood-sugar balance, or sleeping and waking,

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing in and out, the stress response and the relaxation response. Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### occurs when things are out of balance in any of these systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your brain cells are injured by overexcitation or die, every one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### problems we have been discussing in this book ensues—ADHD, autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and more.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that we understand how to modulate this system naturally

<!-- chunk -->

### to prevent overexcitation and brain injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the things we have found helpful to stabilize mood and an irritable

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system and to prevent cell death work through their calming action. All

<!-- chunk -->

### slow down the overstimulation of this receptor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium is the natural guard against too much stimulation of the NMDA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor by glutamate, the neurotransmitter that normally flips the “on” switch.

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc is also a natural relaxant. GABA, taurine, vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### , vitamin D, n-

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcysteine (the glutathione booster), and even green tea all act as a brake on

<!-- chunk -->

### the overstimulation of the NMDA receptor.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, mercury, arachidonic acid (an inflammatory omega-6 fat

<!-- chunk -->

### from dietary sources like meat and dairy), cortisol (the stress hormone), and

<!-- chunk -->

### homocysteine (because of a lack of folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , or B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) all overexcite the NMDA

<!-- chunk -->

### receptor, leading to cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Understanding this helps us learn how to prevent overexcitation and calm

<!-- chunk -->

### things down. Doing this is part of the brain-protective and balancing plan in

<!-- chunk -->

### Parts III and IV of The UltraMind Solution.

### something drawing the link between resveratrol, aging, and mitochondria,

### something that affects brain health and has an impact on all chronic diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me explain why a magic pill won’t work, and what may really help you

<!-- chunk -->

### live longer and prevent all the diseases of aging, including all brain diseases. He

### News about this new “drug,” resveratrol, says it extends life span, lets you

<!-- chunk -->

### But it is not a drug at all, and the excitement only serves to reinforce the

<!-- chunk -->

### idea that a single molecule (whether it is from a drug or a plant) can solve all our

<!-- chunk -->

### health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resveratrol comes from grapes (hence the benefit of red wine), peanuts,

<!-- chunk -->

### berries, and a Chinese herb called hu zhang (polygonum cuspidate, also known

<!-- chunk -->

### as giant knotweed, which is a common ingredient in many Chinese herbal

### formulas). A natural plant defense molecule, resveratrol is only one of many

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial plant compounds called phytonutrients, included in the class called

<!-- chunk -->

### polyphenols, of which there are thousands.

<!-- chunk -->

### These phytonutrients act in many ways, the most important of which is as a

<!-- chunk -->

### genetic control system, turning on and off genes that help us stay healthy. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### the science of nutrigenomics—or how food is information that tells our bodies

<!-- chunk -->

### what to do, not just a source of calories we need for energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### If treating people with a simple dose of resveratrol sounds too good to be

<!-- chunk -->

### true, it is.

<!-- chunk -->

### As much as I support the use of supplements and know about the

<!-- chunk -->

### importance of phytonutrients, all of this excitement about resveratrol is

<!-- chunk -->

### misguided.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why?

<!-- chunk -->

### Because looking for a quick fix is misguided. To find the real secret to

<!-- chunk -->

### longevity, healthy aging, and fitness we need to look at how this compound

<!-- chunk -->

### works and learn from that the lessons we need on how to keep ourselves healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is the real secret, and how does resveratrol really work?

<!-- chunk -->

### In one word, mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two recent studies (one of which was done by Sinclair himself) shed light

<!-- chunk -->

### on how resveratrol works, how it impacts oxidative stress, and how

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function holds the key to health, brain wellness, weight loss, and

<!-- chunk -->

### longevity.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the first study, published in Nature,


<!-- chunk -->

### David Sinclair and his colleagues

<!-- chunk -->

### gave one group of mice a high-fat (60 percent of calories) diet. In middle age

<!-- chunk -->

### these rats all became obese, got diabetes, fatty livers, and died early.

<!-- chunk -->

### He fed the same diet to another group of mice, but gave them resveratrol at

<!-- chunk -->

### a dose of 24 mg/kg of body weight—which is equivalent to the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### resveratrol found in about 750 to 1, 500 bottles of wine a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### That group still got fat, but lived longer and did not get diabetes or heart

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. They were also more agile and had more endurance than the rats that

<!-- chunk -->

### didn’t get the resveratrol. Interestingly, their cholesterol profiles didn’t improve

<!-- chunk -->

### but they didn’t get heart disease, showing that cholesterol is not the big evil we

<!-- chunk -->

### think it is.

<!-- chunk -->

### So how does resveratrol have these effects? And what does this study on

<!-- chunk -->

### rats have to do with brain disease in people?

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me explain how this relates to your brain. Anything that helps your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria helps your brain, and anything that improves your blood-sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### control, improves insulin resistance and also helps your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## How Resveratrol Works

<!-- chunk -->

### In the study above, resveratrol produced changes associated with longer life

<!-- chunk -->

### span and produced the following biologic effects:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Increased insulin sensitivity leading to better blood-sugar control.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Reduced insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-I) levels—a molecule related

<!-- chunk -->

### to a growth hormone that promotes cancer growth.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)—a signaling system in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body that controls insulin sensitivity and can prevent diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor—coactivator

<!-- chunk -->

### (PGC-1) activity—which is a critical signaling system that turns on genes

<!-- chunk -->

### that improves blood-sugar control and improves mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Increased the number of mitochondria produced by the cells— boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### the capacity to turn food into energy and to burn calories.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Improved motor function, making the old rats more agile.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. And finally the resveratrol worked by opposing the effects of aging by

<!-- chunk -->

### modifying 144 out of 153 metabolic pathways, controlled by genes,

<!-- chunk -->

### many of which control mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what does this study really tell us—that aging, including much of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### aging and disease, is controlled in large part by sugar and insulin function in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body! Sound familiar?

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much sugar in your diet causes your body to produce too much insulin.

<!-- chunk -->

### This triggers more inflammation and oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### injury.


<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial damage, in turn, leads to even more insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

### That means anything that protects the mitochondria, like resveratrol, will prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### at least part of the damage that leads to insulin resistance and hence mitigate

<!-- chunk -->

### many possible problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### People with genetically underperforming mitochondria, like the children of

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetics, are more susceptible to mitochondrial injury if they have a poor diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t exercise, and don’t get enough of the right nutrients to protect their


<!-- chunk -->

### The next study published in Cell by Johan Auwerx,


<!-- chunk -->

### from the Institute of

<!-- chunk -->

### Genetics and Molecular and Cell Biology in Illkirch, France, tested much higher

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of resveratrol in mice, eighteen times as much, or 400 mg/kg of resveratrol

<!-- chunk -->

### —equal to about 360 capsules of resveratrol for a 130-pound person.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their findings were even more dramatic. Imagine achieving the fitness of a

<!-- chunk -->

### trained athlete, staying thin, preventing diabetes and heart disease, and living to

<!-- chunk -->

### 120 years of age while eating a high-calorie, high-fat diet (and taking 360 pills a

<!-- chunk -->

### day of resveratrol!).

<!-- chunk -->

### The rats fed the high doses of the resveratrol along with their high-calorie,

<!-- chunk -->

### high-fat diet had the following effects:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. They did not gain weight and reduced the size of fat cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. They didn’t get prediabetes or metabolic syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. They increased the number of energy-producing mitochondria in muscle

<!-- chunk -->

### cells.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. It turned up their metabolic thermostat (thermogenesis) and increased fat

<!-- chunk -->

### burning in the mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. They increased their endurance and aerobic capacity (without exercise).

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. They maintained their cells’ sensitivity to insulin, hence better blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar control.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. They had enhanced muscle strength and reduced muscle fatigue.

<!-- chunk -->

## 8. They had improved coordination.

<!-- chunk -->

## 9. There were no side effects on any organs.

<!-- chunk -->

## 10. They increased the activity of PCG-1 alpha, which in turn controls

<!-- chunk -->

### genes that improve the function of mitochondria and blood-sugar control.

<!-- chunk -->

### This seems incredible. But it is plausible if you understand these two root

<!-- chunk -->

### causes of obesity, brain injury, aging, and disease—blood-sugar control and the

<!-- chunk -->

### health, number, and function of your mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### That taking only resveratrol even at high doses will allow us to live a

<!-- chunk -->

### depraved life of sloth and gluttony and live disease-free forever, is unlikely. But

<!-- chunk -->

### what these studies do tell us is very important.

<!-- chunk -->

### When taken from a systems perspective—understanding all the influences

<!-- chunk -->

### on blood-sugar control, insulin, and our mitochondrial function (nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### balance, hormone balance, inflammation, toxins, energy production, oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, and psychological stress—or the seven keys to UltraWellness, which lead

<!-- chunk -->

### to an UltraMind)—we can create a lifestyle and program that works to keep us

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy, happy, alert, mentally sharp, thin, and more likely to live to 120.

<!-- chunk -->

## Finding the Gene Control Switch for Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### At a conference on longevity and aging I had a chance to have a conversation

<!-- chunk -->

### with Dr. Leonard Guarente from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who

<!-- chunk -->

### in 1995 discovered a gene called SIR-2 in yeast that controlled longevity. David

<!-- chunk -->

### Sinclair, who authored one of the studies above, was his student.

<!-- chunk -->

### The SIRT-1 gene (which is what it is called in humans) or sirtuin family of

<!-- chunk -->

### genes works by protecting and improving the health of your mitochondria.


<!-- chunk -->

### I

<!-- chunk -->

### asked him how this master gene controlled longevity, the gene through which the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of this grape compound, resveratrol, did its magic.

<!-- chunk -->

### His answer was quite simple really. Sugar! This gene is the master-control

<!-- chunk -->

### switch for healthy aging because it improves blood-sugar balance and insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity through its effects on mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### When your mitochondria are running in top shape, you can metabolize or

<!-- chunk -->

### process all your calories and produce energy. But when they are overloaded with

<!-- chunk -->

### too many empty calories, they are unable to keep up, and too many free radicals

<!-- chunk -->

### are generated, slowing down your cells and your metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### By increasing the activity of this master gene, you improve the overall

<!-- chunk -->

### function of your mitochondria, improve blood-sugar control and insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity, and boost your antioxidant defenses. You live longer, and your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### works better.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is no surprise, since all of the signs of aging such as hardening of the

<!-- chunk -->

### arteries and organ damage (especially brain damage) are increased through

<!-- chunk -->

### worsening blood-sugar control—even before you get diabetes. Diabetics, in fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### have smaller and more poorly functioning mitochondria and get cancer, heart

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, depression, and dementia at far greater rates than the general

<!-- chunk -->

### population.


<!-- chunk -->

### Remarkable new research links mood disorders to problems with insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### and blood-sugar control. In fact, some researchers suggest calling depression

<!-- chunk -->

### “metabolic syndrome type II,” meaning that the changes in the brain from

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial injury lead to altered mood.


<!-- chunk -->

### So if we could fix our blood-sugar control and boost our mitochondria, we

<!-- chunk -->

### could live longer and disease-free.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking a big-picture view, we don’t just want to take a magic pill that will

<!-- chunk -->

### be unlikely to work given all the other real life insults affecting us, such as poor

<!-- chunk -->

### diet, stress, environmental toxins, and sedentary lifestyle.

<!-- chunk -->

### This just takes us back to the basic principles of systems biology and

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine at the foundation of The UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the keys to this program is to rebalance your diet by eating real,

<!-- chunk -->

### whole foods instead of the highly processed, high-calorie, high-fat diets that

<!-- chunk -->

### cause imbalance in your blood sugar and produce catastrophic effects on your


<!-- chunk -->

### Or you could drink 1, 500 bottles of red wine a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what else can you do to boost your mitochondrial function and prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### the destruction of your brain?

# Neuronutrients: Boosting Your Brain Power and Your

# Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking supplements to enhance your mitochondrial performance is actually a

<!-- chunk -->

### well-founded scientific approach to overcoming oxidative stress. It’s simply that

<!-- chunk -->

### taking huge quantities of resveratrol alone (or as some magic pill) without

<!-- chunk -->

### changing your lifestyle or using all the other nutrients needed for optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function is a misguided approach. This is especially true

<!-- chunk -->

### considering the fact that resveratrol really has an impact on your insulin/sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### balance, which is more effectively treated with diet, exercise, and lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### changes anyway.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many vitamins and minerals and “conditionally essential” nutrients are

<!-- chunk -->

### known to control energy production and to protect and defend your

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. These “antiaging” or neuroprotective supplements work because

<!-- chunk -->

### of the way they help protect and optimize mitochondrial function, both directly

<!-- chunk -->

### and indirectly.

<!-- chunk -->

### A number of “basics” are essential, including omega-3 fats, which make up

<!-- chunk -->

### the membrane of the mitochondria, and the two B vitamins, niacin (B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) and

<!-- chunk -->

### riboflavin (B


<!-- chunk -->

### ), which are necessary to help the enzymes involved in turning

<!-- chunk -->

### food into energy in your mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### We get others from our diet or our bodies produce them. But as we age, or

<!-- chunk -->

### are exposed to any type of physical, toxic, or emotional stress, we need to

<!-- chunk -->

### replace these nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### The top mitochondrial nutrients are acetyl-L-carnitine,


<!-- chunk -->

### alpha lipoic acid,

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme Q10, NADH, D-ribose, magnesium, riboflavin (vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ), niacin

<!-- chunk -->

### (vitamin B


<!-- chunk -->

### ), and n-acetylcysteine (NAC). These mitochondrial nutrients and

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants can protect your critical energy-producing factories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Bruce Ames, of the University of California at Berkeley, has been

<!-- chunk -->

### investigating the use of these mitochondrial protective nutrients with much

<!-- chunk -->

### success. In fact, he suggests that we should not just think of nutrients as

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds to prevent disease, but rather as substances that can give us a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic tune-up.


<!-- chunk -->

### He has shown that providing compounds such as alpha lipoic acid and

<!-- chunk -->

### acetyl-L-carnitine can reduce mitochondrial injury and the effects of aging on

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain, including memory, learning, and speed of motor function.


<!-- chunk -->

### The key, he says, is not to get focused on just one nutrient, but to use a

<!-- chunk -->

### whole team of natural compounds to help the body function the way it was

<!-- chunk -->

### designed.


<!-- chunk -->

## A Metabolic Tune-Up: A Systems Strategy

<!-- chunk -->

### All our efforts to help prevent aging and mitochondrial injury have to be

<!-- chunk -->

### coordinated. Here is what Dr. Ames says:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Problems with mitochondrial enzymes lead to less energy production and

<!-- chunk -->

### more free radicals and oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Enzymes can be made to work better by providing helpers, namely

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins and minerals and conditionally essential nutrients (nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### required under certain conditions such as unique genetic needs, extremes

<!-- chunk -->

### of age, stress, and sickness) like B


<!-- chunk -->

### , magnesium, D-ribose, coenzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### Q10, NAC, acetyl-L-carnitine, lipoic acid, and NADH.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. The right nutrients can help the body induce its own antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### defenses. For example, zinc, copper, and manganese are needed for the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of one of our own most powerful antioxidant enzymes called

<!-- chunk -->

### SOD, or superoxide dismutase, and selenium is needed for the function

<!-- chunk -->

### of glutathione peroxidase, which helps your glutathione do its job as an

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant and detoxifier.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Use combinations of antioxidants to soak up free radicals and prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### overproduction of oxidants in the mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Use phospholipids and omega-3 fats such as DHA and EPA to repair and

<!-- chunk -->

### rebuild the mitochondrial membrane.

<!-- chunk -->

### The reason studies don’t show benefit for this or that nutrient is that the

<!-- chunk -->

### studies are designed wrong. What if you put Michael Jordan on a court by

<!-- chunk -->

### himself against the worst team in the NBA? Could he win? Of course not.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antioxidants and nutrients work as a team,


<!-- chunk -->

### and giving just one compound

<!-- chunk -->

### in isolation can actually backfire, producing more damage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have shown that high levels of the antioxidants vitamin E and C in

<!-- chunk -->

### the diet are very powerful, and can lower Alzheimer’s risk by 70 percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### But

<!-- chunk -->

### people who eat diets high in vitamin C and E are eating a plant-based, nutrient-

<!-- chunk -->

### dense diet full of other nutrients and antioxidants.


<!-- chunk -->

### The combination is the key.

<!-- chunk -->

### The plant world is full of powerful protective compounds such as curcumin

<!-- chunk -->

### (the yellow color in curry) and green-tea catechins that can reduce the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s.


<!-- chunk -->

### We must focus on a plant-based diet first,

<!-- chunk -->

### and then boost our efforts with supplemental mitochondrial nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another energy booster is coenzyme Q10,


<!-- chunk -->

### which has been shown to stop

<!-- chunk -->

### or slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease in a sixteen-month study of eighty

<!-- chunk -->

### people.

36;37

<!-- chunk -->

### The dose given was very high, at 1, 200 mg a day, but there were no

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, some patients with Parkinson’s may have a defect in the enzyme

<!-- chunk -->

### that needs coenzyme Q10 to operate properly.


<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, if they have any

<!-- chunk -->

### increased oxidative stress such as from exposure to toxins, their mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### are much more susceptible to damage and loss of energy and they need much

<!-- chunk -->

### higher doses of coenzyme Q10 to protect themselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### What concerns me is new research on the statin drugs (drugs designed to

<!-- chunk -->

### lower cholesterol, like Lipitor and Zocor), which shows that they are

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial poisons. Statins block the body’s ability to produce its own

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme Q10.


<!-- chunk -->

### We know that statins cause muscle damage,


<!-- chunk -->

### but even in

<!-- chunk -->

### people without any symptoms


<!-- chunk -->

### or abnormal blood tests,


<!-- chunk -->

### muscle biopsy shows

<!-- chunk -->

### cell injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### How does this affect a susceptible population? Or someone already

<!-- chunk -->

### burdened by a load of mitochondrial toxins, inflammation, and other factors that

<!-- chunk -->

### create excess free radicals, which are so common in the twenty-first century?

<!-- chunk -->

### One hundred years ago, heart disease was almost unknown and there were

<!-- chunk -->

### no statins. Some cardiologists now suggest putting these drugs in our water

<!-- chunk -->

### supply.


<!-- chunk -->

### Should we be wondering what those more natural conditions were and

<!-- chunk -->

### what we should be eating and doing so we don’t develop preventable lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases? Or should we dump medications in our water supply?

<!-- chunk -->

### Other nutrients have also been shown to be beneficial in animal studies of

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s. These include creatine, nicotinamide,


<!-- chunk -->

### and n-acetylcysteine.


<!-- chunk -->

### But lest you think that all this protection is just important for old brains, it

<!-- chunk -->

### appears that loss of energy production and oxidative stress are critical

<!-- chunk -->

### components of little autistic brains as well.


<!-- chunk -->

### So all across the age spectrum and all across the spectrum of different

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases that affect the brain (and almost everything else), we must focus on

<!-- chunk -->

### keeping our free radicals and oxidative stress in check and our mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy.

# A BRAIN WITHOUT ENERGY

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to share a very important story with you. This is the story of another

<!-- chunk -->

### little boy who made a miraculous recovery using the same techniques you are

<!-- chunk -->

### learning about in The UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### A desperate mother came to see me because her 2½-year-old son had

<!-- chunk -->

### just been diagnosed with autism. He was born bright and happy, breast-

<!-- chunk -->

### fed, and had the best medical care available (including all the vaccinations

<!-- chunk -->

### he could possibly have). He talked, walked, loved, and played normally—

<!-- chunk -->

### that is until after his measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination at twenty-

<!-- chunk -->

### two months.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles,

<!-- chunk -->

### mumps, rubella, chicken pox, hepatitis A and B, influenza, pneumonia,

<!-- chunk -->

### hemophilous, and meningitis—all before he was two years old.

<!-- chunk -->

### I do not believe vaccines cause autism and I support the safe use of

<!-- chunk -->

### vaccinations, but we need to revisit how and when to safely provide them to our

<!-- chunk -->

### children. For a comprehensive perspective on this topic see Dr. Stephanie

<!-- chunk -->

### Cave’s book, What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Vaccinations.

<!-- chunk -->

### After this string of vaccinations he lost his language, became detached,

<!-- chunk -->

### withdrawn, less interactive, and was unable to relate in normal ways to his

<!-- chunk -->

### parents and other children—all signs of autism. How could a normal boy

<!-- chunk -->

### be transformed so quickly?

<!-- chunk -->

### He was taken to the best doctors in New York and it was “pronounced”

<!-- chunk -->

### that he had autism (as if it were a thing you catch like a bug), and told that

<!-- chunk -->

### there was nothing to be done except arduous, painful, and barely effective

<!-- chunk -->

### behavioral and occupational therapy techniques. The doctor told his

<!-- chunk -->

### mother the progress would be slow and she should keep her expectations

<!-- chunk -->

### low.

<!-- chunk -->

### Devastated, this woman began to seek other options and found her way

<!-- chunk -->

### to me.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is much yet to undo and peel, like the layers of an onion, but by

<!-- chunk -->

### seeing autism as a body disorder that affects the brain (highlighting the

<!-- chunk -->

### importance of the body-mind effect), there is so much that can be done.

<!-- chunk -->

### Children treated this way, often called the “biomedical model” (see

<!-- chunk -->

### www.autism.com for more information, resources, and conferences for doctors

<!-- chunk -->

### and parents), can often have dramatic and remarkable (if not miraculous)

<!-- chunk -->

### recoveries.

<!-- chunk -->

### So what did I find in this little boy that gave me clues about how to

<!-- chunk -->

### treat him?

<!-- chunk -->

### When I first saw Sam, he was deep in the wordless inner world of

<!-- chunk -->

### autism. Watching him was like seeing someone on a psychedelic drug trip.

<!-- chunk -->

### We dug into his biochemistry and genetics and found many things to

<!-- chunk -->

### account for the problems he was having.

<!-- chunk -->

### He had a very high level of antibodies to gluten. He was allergic not

<!-- chunk -->

### only to wheat, but to dairy, eggs, yeast, soy, and about twenty-eight other

<!-- chunk -->

### foods in total. He had a leaky gut, which was very inflamed, and he had

<!-- chunk -->

### three species of yeast but no healthy bacteria growing in his inner tube of

<!-- chunk -->

### life, his intestines. Urine tests showed very high levels of Dlactate—an

<!-- chunk -->

### indicator of overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was deficient in zinc, magnesium, manganese, B

12 ,

<!-- chunk -->

### , vitamin A,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin D, and omega-3 fats. He had trouble making energy in his

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria (common in autistic children). The loss of energy in his cells

<!-- chunk -->

### led to his brain losing energy, so it couldn’t do its job.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was depleted in amino acids, necessary for normal brain function

<!-- chunk -->

### and detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### His blood showed high levels of aluminum and lead and his hair showed

<!-- chunk -->

### very high levels of antimony and arsenic—signs of a very toxic little boy.

<!-- chunk -->

### His levels of sulfur and glutathione were low, indicating he couldn’t muster

<!-- chunk -->

### the power to detox all these metals.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact his genes showed a major weak spot in glutathione metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is the main detox highway for getting rid of metals and pesticides

<!-- chunk -->

### and the main antioxidant in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### He also had trouble with methylation, which is required to make normal

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters and brain chemicals and critical for helping the body get

<!-- chunk -->

### rid of toxins. This showed up as low levels of homocysteine (a sign of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with folate metabolism) and high methylmalonic acid (a sign of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with B


<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism).

<!-- chunk -->

### He also had two genes that set him up for more problems with his system

<!-- chunk -->

### (COMT and MTHFR, which both control this process of methylation). He

<!-- chunk -->

### had very high levels of oxidative stress or free radical activity, including

<!-- chunk -->

### markers that told me his brain was under free radical fire and


<!-- chunk -->

### It seems complicated, doesn’t it? Actually it’s not. I simply worked through

<!-- chunk -->

### the seven keys of UltraWellness, saw how everything was connected, and

<!-- chunk -->

### created a plan to get to the causes of the problems. Then I helped Sam deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### all the biochemical and physiological rubble that those causes had left along the

<!-- chunk -->

### road.

<!-- chunk -->

### So what did I do with Sam?

<!-- chunk -->

### Having the new road map of Functional Medicine and UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### makes it straightforward.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take away what’s bugging him.

<!-- chunk -->

### Give his body what it is missing and needs to thrive (based on his own

<!-- chunk -->

### biochemical uniqueness).

<!-- chunk -->

### And his body does the rest.

<!-- chunk -->

### • • •

<!-- chunk -->

### This is what we did with Sam:

<!-- chunk -->

### Fixed his gut and cooled the inflammation in there.

<!-- chunk -->

### Took away the gluten and food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Got rid of the yeast with antifungals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Killed off the toxic bacteria in his small intestine with special antibiotics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Put back healthy bacteria with probiotics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Helped him digest his food with enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Replaced the missing nutrients and coenzymes to help his genes work

<!-- chunk -->

### better.

<!-- chunk -->

### Added back zinc, magnesium, folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , vitamin A, and vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gave him brain-supporting omega-3 fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gave him coenzyme Q10 to help his mitochondria return to normal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Helped him detoxify and reduce oxidative stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Added high-dose B


<!-- chunk -->

### shots (with a special form of B


<!-- chunk -->

### —methyl B


<!-- chunk -->

### ) to

<!-- chunk -->

### turn on his brain chemistry and get his detox system unstuck.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gave him a chelating medication (DMSA) and detoxifying nutrients to

<!-- chunk -->

### help him get rid of the metals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Does this sound familiar? Improve nutrition, reduce inflammation, heal the

<!-- chunk -->

### gut, and detoxify. It is the basis of the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### No matter what the disease, biology has basic laws we have to follow and

<!-- chunk -->

### understand. All the details of Sam’s story fit into these laws. We just have to dig

<!-- chunk -->

### After three weeks on a gluten-free diet during which we treated his gut,

<!-- chunk -->

### he showed dramatic and remarkable improvements. Sam got back much of

<!-- chunk -->

### his language and showed much more connection and relatedness to other

<!-- chunk -->

### people in his interactions.

<!-- chunk -->

### After four months, he was able to enter a more mainstream school, was

<!-- chunk -->

### more focused, and used more words.

<!-- chunk -->

### At ten months we retested him and found that his gut inflammation was

<!-- chunk -->

### gone, his overgrowth of gut bacteria was gone, and his detox system was

<!-- chunk -->

### working much better. The tests that showed his mitochondria and energy

<!-- chunk -->

### system weren’t functioning well were now back to normal. His

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, which were unable to provide the energy necessary for his

<!-- chunk -->

### brain to function, now were running at nearly full speed.

<!-- chunk -->

### But most important, he went from nonverbal to verbally fluent and no

<!-- chunk -->

### longer qualified for a special school or special services because he “lost”

<!-- chunk -->

### his diagnosis of autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sam now has a wonderful sense of humor (typically completely absent in

<!-- chunk -->

### autistic children), and engages in spontaneous play and hugs with friends

<!-- chunk -->

### and family.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, every child with behavior problems—whether it is ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### autism, or something else—is unique. Each has to find his or her own path with

<!-- chunk -->

### a trained doctor. But the gates are open and the wide road of healing is in front

<!-- chunk -->

### of you.

<!-- chunk -->

### You simply have to take the first step.

# Boost Energy Metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy is something we lose with age. But it can also be lost because of

<!-- chunk -->

### anything that triggers more free radicals and oxidative stress or damage to our


<!-- chunk -->

### Even as we are learning how mitochondrial injury is one of the final

<!-- chunk -->

### common pathways in so many neurological and psychiatric disorders, we are

<!-- chunk -->

### also learning how to protect and defend ourselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Getting a metabolic tune-up is not only possible, but also necessary for

<!-- chunk -->

### most of us. Thankfully by eating a colorful plant-based diet, reducing toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### exposures, and supplementing with mitochondrial protective and antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds we can protect and restore our energy metabolism to optimal


<!-- chunk -->

### In the last chapter of Part II (chapter 12) we will look at how the mind

<!-- chunk -->

### influences the body. You have learned all the ways so far in which the body

<!-- chunk -->

### affects the mind. But remember, the communication is bidirectional: top down

<!-- chunk -->

### and bottom up. The body affects the mind and the mind affects the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thoughts, feelings, beliefs, attitudes, and life traumas can all trigger

<!-- chunk -->

### damage to the brain. This brain damage occurs because stress itself causes

<!-- chunk -->

### depletion of nutrients from the body, changes our hormones, creates

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, damages the gut, has direct toxic effects, and increases oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wow! All that just from negative thoughts.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you learned so far, if you change your body, you will change your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the next chapter, you will learn that if you change your mind you will also

<!-- chunk -->

### change your body.


# KEY #7: CALM YOUR MIND


<!-- chunk -->

### Stress is the perception of a real or imagined threat to your body or

<!-- chunk -->

### your ego.

<!-- chunk -->

### One man’s meat is another man’s poison.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thoughts are things. They can heal or harm. Beliefs mold your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Perceptions can please or paralyze your nervous system. Life traumas and

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences rewire and reorganize your brain’s connections and communications

<!-- chunk -->

### systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other than eating breakfast regularly, and eating more fruits and vegetables,

<!-- chunk -->

### the one characteristic that is present in all the healthy aged is resiliency.

<!-- chunk -->

### Resiliency is that hard-to-measure quality of adapting to change, shifting with

<!-- chunk -->

### changing tides rather than drowning, seeing the glass half full, or knowing how

<!-- chunk -->

### to turn lemons into lemonade.

<!-- chunk -->

### Plasticity is another way to describe this quality—being adaptable,

<!-- chunk -->

### changeable, and malleable. Remarkably, the nature of the brain mirrors the

<!-- chunk -->

### nature of our thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes. A stiff, rigid, “hard” personality is

<!-- chunk -->

### reflected in stiff cells, hard, rigid plaques in the brain, and a general loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### resiliency and the ability to renew, remember, and repair.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is not just a figurative metaphor for what happens. Your brain literally

<!-- chunk -->

### stiffens, slows, and loses function in direct relationship to your thoughts, beliefs,

<!-- chunk -->

### and attitudes about you and your place in the world. How each of us responds to

<!-- chunk -->

### our life—to our perceptions—has enormous implications for how we feel, how

<!-- chunk -->

### we age, and the health of our brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why is it that some can emerge from enormous strife and conflict, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### war, violence, abuse, and rape, with a deeper sense of life and beauty and

<!-- chunk -->

### connection to meaning while others are debilitated from minimal life traumas

<!-- chunk -->

### such as a minor car accident?

<!-- chunk -->

### Victor Frankel, the internationally renowned psychiatrist and author of

<!-- chunk -->

### Man’s Search for Meaning, is an interesting example of a man with

<!-- chunk -->

### extraordinary resiliency. Not only did he survive the Holocaust, but he used the

<!-- chunk -->

### horror he experienced to create what was in his time a revolutionary approach to

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapy and he wrote about his experience to try to help heal the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whether you are consumed by the traumatic experiences in your life or

<!-- chunk -->

### ripen and learn from them is largely a question of perception, thoughts, and your

<!-- chunk -->

### sense of control and place in the world. How each of us measures our life, and

<!-- chunk -->

### creates meaning and purpose in the small and large things, determines, perhaps

<!-- chunk -->

### more than anything, our capacity for resiliency and wholeness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your mind affects your body. Your mental health affects your physical

<!-- chunk -->

### health. This in turn affects your mental health again. These are not two separate

<!-- chunk -->

### systems. They are intertwined and interconnected in subtle and sophisticated

<!-- chunk -->

### ways you need to understand if you are going to achieve UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### While not all of the ways in which the mind influences the body are fully

<!-- chunk -->

### understood, in this chapter I will give you an overview of what the research does

<!-- chunk -->

### tell us and explain some of the ways your mind affects your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### But first, take this quiz to assess your stress response, and the level of stress

<!-- chunk -->

### in your life.

### —Ideas and Opinions,

ALBERT EINSTEIN,

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1986, I traveled to Nepal as part of an expedition to study the public

<!-- chunk -->

### health problems of a small village near the Tibetan border. Along the way I

<!-- chunk -->

### encountered a remarkable man who had faced grave threats to his life and his

<!-- chunk -->

### place in the world. He was a Tibetan doctor captured in 1959 during the Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

### invasion and sent to a Chinese gulag for twenty-two years. Interested in Tibetan

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, I had asked our guides to introduce me to this Tibetan doctor. We

<!-- chunk -->

### waited outside his office.

<!-- chunk -->

### An old monk with long white whiskers and enormous ears that fanned like

<!-- chunk -->

### sails from his head informed us we could see the doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### He came out of his room, which adjoined the small clinic. He was dressed

<!-- chunk -->

### in long maroon robes, his head shaved. Thick, black-rimmed glasses were held

<!-- chunk -->

### around his head by a red lama string (a sacred red string used to serve as a

<!-- chunk -->

### reminder of the Buddha) nowhere near his ears. His face radiated a serene and

<!-- chunk -->

### happy interior. The doctor sat cross-legged on a platform in front of his desk

<!-- chunk -->

### listening to my questions.

<!-- chunk -->

### I looked around the small room. In one corner was his desk, and behind it

<!-- chunk -->

### along the wall was an assortment of herbal preparations in the form of small,

<!-- chunk -->

### mud-colored round pills, carefully labeled and stored in Horlick’s malt jars. In

<!-- chunk -->

### each corner, bags upon bags of these medicines were stacked, all brought

<!-- chunk -->

### overland from Tibet.

<!-- chunk -->

### There were a few chairs, one bed frame without a mattress, and a large

<!-- chunk -->

### photograph of the Dalai Lama wearing a great crescent-shaped yellow hat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Though spartan, the room, the medicines, and the monk/doctor,

<!-- chunk -->

### priest/healer gave me the feeling of safety and protection.

<!-- chunk -->

### Slowly and in pieces his story unfolded. He was sixty-eight years old and

<!-- chunk -->

### was born in western Tibet. There he learned medicine as a young monk as an

<!-- chunk -->

### apprentice to another doctor—learning the texts, the herbs and plants, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### techniques for preparation most doctors learn in formal medical schools. His

<!-- chunk -->

### remote village had no medical schools. He learned the subtle skill of pulse

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis and stool and urine analysis from his teacher, and engaged

<!-- chunk -->

### simultaneously in the life of a novice monk.

<!-- chunk -->

### He carried on with his work until 1959, when the Chinese invaded Tibet,

<!-- chunk -->

### jailed and murdered religious and political leaders, and oppressed the elite class.

<!-- chunk -->

### He remained for twenty-two years in China’s jails, where he was made to serve

<!-- chunk -->

### as a laborer, carrying wood for the first eight years he was in prison.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was moved several times, first into western Tibet, then Xiagatse, and

<!-- chunk -->

### then near Lhasa, the traditional capital of the country. He did not practice

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine for the first eight years of his imprisonment. However, once the

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese realized his talents they thought he could serve them better as a clinic

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor in jail.

<!-- chunk -->

### He worked there, still a prisoner, until they gave him his own clinic of

<!-- chunk -->

### Tibetan medicine, which he ran for a few years near Lhasa. In 1981, he was

<!-- chunk -->

### given the choice to stay in Lhasa or return to his native village in western Tibet.

<!-- chunk -->

### He chose the latter. After a few months in his village, at the age of sixty-three, he

<!-- chunk -->

### escaped across the Himalayas into Dharmsala, India, to visit the Dalai Lama,

<!-- chunk -->

### who told him to go to Katmandu to practice.

<!-- chunk -->

### I found it difficult to reconcile the serene, calm, happy man who

<!-- chunk -->

### dispassionately told me of his twenty-two-year imprisonment in a Chinese gulag,

<!-- chunk -->

### where he was stripped of his community, his place in the world, prevented from

<!-- chunk -->

### practicing Buddhism, tortured, and abused.

<!-- chunk -->

### I asked him about the greatest danger he faced during his twenty-two years

<!-- chunk -->

### of imprisonment. I expected him to say the physical and psychological torture

<!-- chunk -->

### and relentless, sophisticated brain-washing techniques designed to force him to

<!-- chunk -->

### renounce his spiritual beliefs and monkhood and embrace Communist ideology.

<!-- chunk -->

### “The greatest danger I faced during my imprisonment was the few moments

<!-- chunk -->

### I thought I might lose my compassion for my Chinese captors,” he said.

# Meaning, Purpose, and Health

<!-- chunk -->

### The lack of meaning in life is a soul sickness whose full extent and full

<!-- chunk -->

### import our age has not as yet begun to comprehend.

—C. G. JUNG

<!-- chunk -->

### Meaning makes a great many things endurable—perhaps everything.

<!-- chunk -->

### Through the creation of meaning... a new cosmos arises.

—C. G. JUNG

<!-- chunk -->

### The same event or experience can have a different impact on different

<!-- chunk -->

### people. Most of us cannot imagine worrying about having compassion for those

<!-- chunk -->

### who kept us locked away from everything we value and believe in for twenty-

<!-- chunk -->

### two years.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet somehow, in small and large ways, our sense of control, our sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### meaning, purpose, and connection in life is one of the most powerful factors that

<!-- chunk -->

### determines our health and well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### What do you feel connected to? What gives you meaning and purpose in

<!-- chunk -->

### life? Answers to questions like these define who we are, not only mentally, but

<!-- chunk -->

### also physically.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of our beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions are learned behaviors that

<!-- chunk -->

### can be unlearned. Sudden shifts happen. But more often a slow, gradual

<!-- chunk -->

### examination of our lives and our place in the world are necessary to emerge from

<!-- chunk -->

### the chronic stress of “half-empty” perceptions and ANTS (automatic negative

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts) in our brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### We all know those people in life who see everything negatively. For them,

<!-- chunk -->

### nothing can be right or good. The glass is always half empty. I would hate to see

<!-- chunk -->

### their brains on an MRI.

<!-- chunk -->

### Disconcertingly, studies show that it is not lifestyle or even socioeconomic

<!-- chunk -->

### status, but the perception of our place in the world that determines health. One

<!-- chunk -->

### would think disease risk factors commonly associated with poverty or low

<!-- chunk -->

### socioeconomic status such as smoking, consumption of alcohol, junk food,

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity, and lack of exercise should explain the higher rates of disease and death

<!-- chunk -->

### in poverty-stricken communities.

<!-- chunk -->

### But a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that

<!-- chunk -->

### even after controlling for all those behaviors and risk factors, higher rates of

<!-- chunk -->

### disease and death could not be explained just by these factors alone.


<!-- chunk -->

### The key, they said, was not behavior but perception of one’s place in the

<!-- chunk -->

### world. The key findings that could account for the higher risk of disease and

<!-- chunk -->

### death were:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Lack of social relationships and social supports.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Personality dispositions (thinking the glass is half empty), including a

<!-- chunk -->

### lost sense of mastery, optimism, control, and self-esteem, or heightened

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of anger and hostility.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Chronic and acute stress in life and work, including the stress of racism,

<!-- chunk -->

### classism, and other factors related to the inequitable distribution of power

<!-- chunk -->

### and resources.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is more than stress alone that contributes to or creates the majority of

<!-- chunk -->

### modern chronic diseases—from the epidemic of mental disorders, including

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety, to heart disease, and more.


<!-- chunk -->

### Disease is a disconnection from our sense of place in the world, a loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### control and meaning as we drift from television channel to television channel

<!-- chunk -->

### looking for a program to satisfy us; consume food disconnected from its origins,

<!-- chunk -->

### processed and unidentifiable from its natural state; as our families separate,

<!-- chunk -->

### disconnect, and communicate through text messaging and e-mail. Poverty alone

<!-- chunk -->

### does not increase the prevalence of illness, morbidity, and mortality. A lost sense

<!-- chunk -->

### of culture, control, and meaning are major factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### How do you take a pill to fix that?

<!-- chunk -->

### Ultimately, our perceptions mediate or influence our biology in a direct and

<!-- chunk -->

### measurable way. The science of “PNEI,” or psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune

<!-- chunk -->

### system, has mapped out these connections clearly and powerfully.

<!-- chunk -->

### All our self-talk and perceptions—good or bad—work through a

<!-- chunk -->

### coordinated network or system. This system is called the HPATGG axis

<!-- chunk -->

### (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-thyroid-gonadal-gut axis or network).

<!-- chunk -->

### A big mouthful, yes, but it is simply the system that governs the

<!-- chunk -->

### bidirectional connection between your thoughts and feelings, your hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

### your immune system, and your gut (which contains all three—hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system, and nervous system).

<!-- chunk -->

### Everything talks to everything all the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have reviewed how hormones, the immune system, and the gut all talk

<!-- chunk -->

### to the brain earlier in Part II. Now we will review how the brain talks back!

<!-- chunk -->

### Happy talk = a happy human.

<!-- chunk -->

### Negative talk = depression, anxiety, behavioral problems, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at how this works.

# The Brain and Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### How do thoughts, perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes affect us?

<!-- chunk -->

### A lot of us have felt that rush of adrenaline in our lives from a near-miss car

<!-- chunk -->

### accident, or other thoughts that we are in danger. One night, a few years ago, I

<!-- chunk -->

### awoke hearing the rustling of papers and banging in my house. I grabbed the

<!-- chunk -->

### phone and called 911. My heart was racing, my breathing intensified, I could see

<!-- chunk -->

### in the dark and could hear the slightest sound.

<!-- chunk -->

### The police came over, peered in, and saw our new puppy had escaped from

<!-- chunk -->

### his pen and was playing around in the house.

<!-- chunk -->

### In my mind and body, I “knew” there was a burglar. That imaginary

<!-- chunk -->

### “perception” turned into real biology. My flight-or-fight response was triggered.

<!-- chunk -->

### The stress (and relaxation) response is controlled by the brain’s command

<!-- chunk -->

### and control center, called the hypothalamus. When I heard that “burglar,” it

<!-- chunk -->

### switched on the stress response, which sends messages out to every part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body through an automatic part of your nervous system called the sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### When this part of our nervous system is switched on (which is most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### time for most of us), our adrenal glands release more cortisol and the stimulating

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or

<!-- chunk -->

### noradrenaline). These chemicals are activating and energizing.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a great system to have—especially when we are in trouble or danger.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of zebras grazing in the savanna. Along comes a hungry lion and all the

<!-- chunk -->

### zebras take off acutely stressed. Then one gets killed and the rest go back to

<!-- chunk -->

### calmly grazing. Basically, your body acts like those zebras when it sets off your

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response.

<!-- chunk -->

### According to Robert Sapolsky, of Stanford University, that is why zebras

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t get ulcers.


<!-- chunk -->

### They have an immediate jolt of stress, and when it’s over they

<!-- chunk -->

### go back to calmly grazing. Their stress response is turned on rapidly. Then when

<!-- chunk -->

### the danger is over, it’s turned off.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem in our culture is the chronic, unremitting, unrelenting stress

<!-- chunk -->

### and endless stressful inputs to our nervous system, including our nutrient-

<!-- chunk -->

### depleted toxic diet, environmental toxins, electropollution, and loss of a sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### control and community.

<!-- chunk -->

### This puts us in a chronic state of alarm. In his book The End of Stress as We

<!-- chunk -->

### Know It, pioneering neuroscientist Bruce McEwen explains how chronic levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of stress lead to wear and tear on our systems. He calls this the “allostatic

<!-- chunk -->

### load.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Think of it as the sum total of all the stressors on your system over a

<!-- chunk -->

### lifetime.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these excess stressors—stressors we were not designed to deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### on a chronic and repetitive basis—lead to overactivation of the sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system and stress response, followed by burnout.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Sapolsky has mapped out the way in which this chronic stress damages

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. High levels of cortisol, the major stress hormone, damage the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### When considered from an adaptive point of view, when we are in dangerous

<!-- chunk -->

### or stressful situations, we want to remember everything about it. That’s a good

<!-- chunk -->

### thing; it helps us avoid the situation in the future.

<!-- chunk -->

### Figure 15: Allostatic load

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why there are so many receptors for cortisol in the hippocampus, the

<!-- chunk -->

### memory center of the brain. Since we need to remember dangerous situations to

<!-- chunk -->

### avoid them in the future, our body is perfectly designed to help us do this.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, in the modern world this system is overactivated. We don’t need

<!-- chunk -->

### to remember every situation we perceive as stressful. And high levels of cortisol

<!-- chunk -->

### over the long term injure the hippocampus, leading to impaired memory,


<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, and depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sonia Lupien from McGill University has also shown

<!-- chunk -->

### how stress shrinks the memory center and has damaging effects on our brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function and cognition.

7;8

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress literally eats away at your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of stress can be seen quite clearly in those who suffer post-

<!-- chunk -->

### traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder that is the result of

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to some traumatic event and causes the person who experienced the

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma to live in a state of hyperarousal. This condition affects about 15 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of those who experience a major trauma such as war, violence, or abuse. It

<!-- chunk -->

### changes your brain and rewires your response to stress. Many who went through

<!-- chunk -->

### the trauma of 9/11 experienced PTSD.


<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress has many negative effects on the body and mind that help

<!-- chunk -->

### explain the widespread problems with obesity, health, and brain function in

<!-- chunk -->

### today’s world. All the feedback from the body and the feed “down” from the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain works through the over or under activity of this important HPATGG

<!-- chunk -->

### system (the communication network that connects your brain with your entire

<!-- chunk -->

### body).

<!-- chunk -->

### So any “stress,” whether it is physical danger, a thought, perception, toxin,

<!-- chunk -->

### allergen, infection, or even abnormal gut bacteria, has negative effects

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout this system. These effects are widespread and can be very powerful.

# HOW THE BRAIN CONTROLS AUTOMATIC FUNCTIONS

<!-- chunk -->

### Your body governs your stress and relaxation responses through your

<!-- chunk -->

### autonomic nervous system. This system controls all of the automatic

<!-- chunk -->

### functions in your body, and is divided into two parts: the sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t have any control over the sympathetic nervous system, and

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s a good thing you don’t. It controls critical bodily functions like your

<!-- chunk -->

### heartbeat and the flow of your blood. Imagine what might happen if you

<!-- chunk -->

### could stop your heartbeat or your blood flow just by thinking about it!

<!-- chunk -->

### However, you do have some control over the parasympathetic nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system. This part of your body is partially automated, but it is also

<!-- chunk -->

### responsive to your thoughts. For example, the blinking of your eyes is

<!-- chunk -->

### connected to your parasympathetic nervous system. You have some control

<!-- chunk -->

### over it (you can stop blinking your eyes for a while), but not full control

<!-- chunk -->

### over it (keep them open long enough and your eyes will blink).

<!-- chunk -->

### The hypothalamus is the command and control center at the top of this

<!-- chunk -->

### entire chain of events. Its job is to control all “automatic” functions. Stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### as I mentioned above, is controlled by your sympathetic nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have control over the inputs that cause stress, but you have no control

<!-- chunk -->

### over the response itself. If you perceive stress, your body will react.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relaxation, on the other hand, is something you can control. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### governed by your parasympathetic nervous system, so you can consciously

<!-- chunk -->

### engage “the relaxation response,” as I will discuss below.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic stress affects all of your autonomic functions negatively, but

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation helps balance all them. These functions include:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Control of blood pressure and electrolyte balance.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Control of energy metabolism and metabolic rate.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Regulation of body temperature.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Control of reproduction and sleep cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Regulation of the stress response (and relaxation response) via

<!-- chunk -->

### autonomic activity coordination.

<!-- chunk -->

## What an Overactive Stress Response Does to You

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a short list of the effects of an overactivated stress response over the

<!-- chunk -->

### long term.


<!-- chunk -->

### I list these here just to show you the extent of the research and our

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding of how stress negatively affects us and our brains. Chronic stress

<!-- chunk -->

### over time:

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases inflammation and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Th1 immune response), which have all been linked to depression, bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces the natural relaxation and anti-inflammatory calming, memory-

<!-- chunk -->

### enhancing neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### Damages the hippocampus, leading to memory loss and mood disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases “excitotoxicity” and activation of the NMDA receptors (the

<!-- chunk -->

### on/off switch for your cells) leading to cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces serotonin levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces BDNF (the brain’s healing and repair factor necessary for the

<!-- chunk -->

### formation of new brain cells).

<!-- chunk -->

### Lowers growth hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces slow wave sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces social interactions and sexual receptivity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases abdominal fat and insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Interferes with thyroid function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Activates pathways (BAX and p53) that lead to death of the mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### and loss of energy production.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases the release of fats into the bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

### Raises triglycerides, lowers HDL (“good”) cholesterol, and raises LDL

<!-- chunk -->

### (“bad”) cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases stickiness of blood and platelet aggregation, leading to clots

<!-- chunk -->

### (which lead to heart attacks and strokes).

<!-- chunk -->

### Causes loss of muscle.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, as you can see, stress is a major problem that clearly affects the health

<!-- chunk -->

### of your body and your brain. But can we do anything about it?

# Is This Brain Damage Reversible?

### Just reading this list of harmful events that happen as a result of a chronic

### stress response may make you want to join a Tibetan monastery.

### But then again, you might be thrown into a gulag. So that’s not the answer.

<!-- chunk -->

### What the Tibetan monks know how to do is to modulate the effects of stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### They have learned how to control something most of us have no awareness of—

<!-- chunk -->

### our vagus nerve, or the antidote to the stress response. This is our body’s natural

<!-- chunk -->

### balancing system.


<!-- chunk -->

### The vagus nerve is the nerve that comes from the brain and controls the

<!-- chunk -->

### parasympathetic nervous system, which controls our relaxation response. And

<!-- chunk -->

### this nervous system uses the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, as its main method

<!-- chunk -->

### of communication with the rest of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tibetan monks didn’t do this intentionally, but engaging in practices such as

<!-- chunk -->

### meditation and the study of the nature of the mind, perception, and

<!-- chunk -->

### consciousness allowed them to move into a different state of awareness. That

<!-- chunk -->

### awareness gave them the ability to slow down their experiences, develop

<!-- chunk -->

### compassion, and break down the sense of separateness between self and others

<!-- chunk -->

### that leads to feelings of disconnection, loss of control, powerlessness, and lack

<!-- chunk -->

### of self-esteem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Monks don’t practice these ancient techniques to improve their memory,

<!-- chunk -->

### fight depression, lower blood pressure or heart rate, or boost their immune

<!-- chunk -->

### systems, although all of those things happen.

<!-- chunk -->

### The monks practice these techniques to develop habits of mind and

<!-- chunk -->

### perception that allow them to have a different experience of their world.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this alteration in perception isn’t available only to Tibetan monks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others have it too.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Kenneth Pelletier studied the effects of perceptions, thoughts, and

<!-- chunk -->

### beliefs on health and reviewed them in his book Sound Mind, Sound Body. He

<!-- chunk -->

### examined, not the sick, but the well. What are the characteristics of people who

<!-- chunk -->

### are successful in life in their work, relationships, and ability to be happy?

<!-- chunk -->

### They did not necessarily practice stress management techniques, although

<!-- chunk -->

### practicing active relaxation is essential for health. Rather, they possessed a sense

<!-- chunk -->

### of purpose, meaning, and connection to what was important in life.

# GETTING RID OF ANTS IN YOUR HEAD

<!-- chunk -->

### Though I won’t be discussing them extensively in this book, there are

<!-- chunk -->

### many techniques available to help you get the ANTS (automatic negative

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts) out of your brain. Learning to relax and stimulate the vagus

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve (which I will discuss in a moment) helps, but there are other

<!-- chunk -->

### techniques as well, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and the new

<!-- chunk -->

### field of personal coaching. See Resources for more information on how to

<!-- chunk -->

### work on automatic negative thinking.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III, I will give you specific tools you can use to turn off the stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response, turn on the relaxation response, and find your “pause” button.

<!-- chunk -->

## Getting to Vagus: Surgery or Meditation?

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two high-tech ways to turn off the stress response and activate the

<!-- chunk -->

### parasympathetic nervous system. You can cut out your adrenal glands. Or you

<!-- chunk -->

### can get a pacemaker that stimulates the vagus nerve. Neither of those options is

<!-- chunk -->

### too attractive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies show that the hippocampus shrinks because of an adrenal (or

<!-- chunk -->

### pituitary) tumor that produces too much cortisol (Cushing’s disease), which

<!-- chunk -->

### leads to depression and impaired memory and cognitive function.


<!-- chunk -->

### But the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers found that by removing the adrenal gland tumor and lowering the

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol levels, the hippocampus increases in size


<!-- chunk -->

### and memory and mood

<!-- chunk -->

### improve.


<!-- chunk -->

### While studying rats, Heather Cameron, from the National Institutes of

<!-- chunk -->

### Health, found that she could increase the rate of neurogenesis and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive function in old rats to the same level as younger rats in just a few days

<!-- chunk -->

### simply by removing their adrenal glands.


<!-- chunk -->

### You can improve your memory and learning, relieve depression, lose

<!-- chunk -->

### weight, and boost your immunity by cutting out your adrenal glands. But then

<!-- chunk -->

### you would be unable to respond to any real threat or danger. So that doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### seem like such a great idea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or you can have a pacemaker implanted in your neck that stimulates the

<!-- chunk -->

### vagus nerve every few seconds. This is now being prescribed to people with

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment-resistant depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, I don’t think that is the major point to be taken away from the

<!-- chunk -->

### studies above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly, they tell us that stimulating the vagus nerve and reducing the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of work your adrenal glands are doing may improve everything from

<!-- chunk -->

### memory to depression. But wouldn’t it be better to learn how to activate the

<!-- chunk -->

### vagus nerve on your own.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can, in fact, do this easily—in just a few seconds.

<!-- chunk -->

## Right now take a deep breath into your belly to the count of five, pause

<!-- chunk -->

## for one second, then breathe out slowly to the count of five. Keep your belly

<!-- chunk -->

## soft. Put down the book and do this five times. Notice how you feel in your

<!-- chunk -->

## body and mind. Then keep reading.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have just activated the vagus nerve, which flows from your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### through your neck, right into your chest, and through your diaphragm. So when

<!-- chunk -->

### you take a deep breath and relax and expand your diaphragm, your vagus nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### is stimulated, you instantly turn on the parasympathetic nervous system, your

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol levels are reduced, and your brain heals.

<!-- chunk -->

### This whole experience is called the relaxation response. The opposite of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response, the relaxation response is necessary for your body to heal, repair,

<!-- chunk -->

### and renew. There are many ways to activate the vagus nerve and turn on the

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation response.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Tibetan monks used meditation, which is very easy to learn (see

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide for resources), and also activates the vagus nerve. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact the deep soft-belly breath you just did is a form of meditation that you can

<!-- chunk -->

### do almost anywhere. In Part III you will learn how to incorporate this into your

<!-- chunk -->

### daily life.

# THE VAGUS NERVE AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY

<!-- chunk -->

### Is there a way to measure your stress response? Is there a way to track

<!-- chunk -->

### the health of your autonomic nervous system and the balance between the

<!-- chunk -->

### sympathetic (or stress) response and the parasympathetic (or relaxation)

<!-- chunk -->

### response?

<!-- chunk -->

### A few new technologies can help you do this.

<!-- chunk -->

### Biofeedback—a technique where special devices are used to help you

<!-- chunk -->

### control bodily processes that are normally involuntary—has been used to

<!-- chunk -->

### help people learn how to control their heart rate, blood pressure, and skin

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature just by using their thoughts.

<!-- chunk -->

### A more sophisticated form of biofeedback measures the variability of

<!-- chunk -->

### your heart rate from beat to beat. This is known as HRV (or heart rate

<!-- chunk -->

### variability), and it can be measured easily like an EKG in your doctor’s

<!-- chunk -->

### office. There are at home tools you can use to achieve this effect. For a

<!-- chunk -->

### listing of these and other relaxation tools go to www.ultramind.com/guide

<!-- chunk -->

### and download the companion guide for this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### The more complex your heart rate and the more variations from beat to

<!-- chunk -->

### beat, the healthier you are. The worse your heart rate is—meaning less

<!-- chunk -->

### variability—the less healthy you are. The least variable heart rate is a flat

<!-- chunk -->

### line!

<!-- chunk -->

### The resiliency and health of your brain are directly related to the

<!-- chunk -->

### complexity and resilience of your heart rate.


<!-- chunk -->

### Lower heart rate variability

<!-- chunk -->

### is a marker for increased stress and links back to all the negative effects we

<!-- chunk -->

### see with stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### By measuring your heart rate variability, you can measure your stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response and you can increase your heart rate variability by activating the

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation response.

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammation and the Vagus Nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### The ability that the vagus nerve has to help you relax, turn off your automatic

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response, and stem the tide of cortisol in your blood is only one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### effects it has on your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### It turns out, it also has a major impact on inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### How does this work?

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, any type of stressor has its impact through your hypothalamus

<!-- chunk -->

### and its wide-ranging control over the autonomic nervous system’s dual functions

<!-- chunk -->

### of stress or relaxation, as I discussed above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even the health effects of pollution register through the autonomic nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system and can be measured by higher stress and lower heart rate variability.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the negative effects from stress are, in part, related to increased


<!-- chunk -->

### How does this work? Remember the key neurotransmitter, acetylcholine?

<!-- chunk -->

### This neurotransmitter is responsible for learning and memory. It is also calming

<!-- chunk -->

### and relaxing, and is the neurotransmitter your vagus nerve uses to send messages

<!-- chunk -->

### of peace and relaxation throughout your body.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is also a major factor regulating the immune system.

<!-- chunk -->

### As we have discussed, brain inflammation is linked to every known mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, attention, memory, or neurodegenerative disease. New research has

<!-- chunk -->

### found that acetylcholine is a major brake on inflammation in the body.


<!-- chunk -->

### Relaxing is anti-inflammatory. Stimulating your vagus nerve sends

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine throughout your body, not only relaxing you but also turning down

<!-- chunk -->

### the fires of inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The body is a beautifully balanced organism working in the natural rhythm

<!-- chunk -->

### of everything in nature—day and night, yin and yang, moon and sun. Too much

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation and you will end up in a blissful puddle. Too much stress and you will

<!-- chunk -->

### be an inflamed, aging, demented, and depressed wreck.

<!-- chunk -->

### So activating the vagus nerve and balancing the sympathetic nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system on a daily basis are critical to keeping your brain and body healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### By activating the vagus nerve you can reverse or stop all the negative

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of stress noted above.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the good news doesn’t end there. Exciting new research has linked the

<!-- chunk -->

### vagus nerve not only to improved neurogenesis, increased BDNF output (brain-

<!-- chunk -->

### derived neurotrophic factor is like super fertilizer for your brain cells) and repair

<!-- chunk -->

### of brain tissue, but to actual regeneration throughout the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stem cells are directly connected to the vagus nerve. It appears that

<!-- chunk -->

### activating the vagus nerve can stimulate stem cells to produce new cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### repair and rebuild our own organs.


<!-- chunk -->

### No need for placental injections, embryos,

<!-- chunk -->

### or fetal research. Just relax and you will stimulate your own stem cells to create

<!-- chunk -->

### a new you!

# The Stress of Our Food

<!-- chunk -->

### While thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions can trigger a stress response, so can

<!-- chunk -->

### any physical or chemical insult. One of the biggest stress triggers can be the food

<!-- chunk -->

### we eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us think of food as just calories. But new findings make it clear that

<!-- chunk -->

### what you put in your body is much more than just energy. The quality and type

<!-- chunk -->

### of food directly influences your genes and the stress response.

<!-- chunk -->

## Xenohormesis: The Attack of the Foreign Molecules in Food

<!-- chunk -->

### In his movie Super Size Me, Morgan Spurlock ate three fast food meals a day

<!-- chunk -->

### for one month. Most of us recognize that eating a lot of fried, processed food,

<!-- chunk -->

### full of trans fat, high-fructose corn syrup, and calories will make us gain weight,

<!-- chunk -->

### promote heart disease and diabetes, and even give us fatty livers.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what struck me the most was not that his cholesterol or blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### went up, but that his personality changed. He became aggressive, depressed,

<!-- chunk -->

### restless, foggy, and felt “good” only when he was eating the food. He became

<!-- chunk -->

### addicted to the food and felt drugged.

<!-- chunk -->

### The explanation for this may be that our current food supply—which is

<!-- chunk -->

### genetically modified or engineered; grown in nutrient-depleted soils and

<!-- chunk -->

### fertilized with petrochemicals; shipped in boxes across thousands of miles; filled

<!-- chunk -->

### with antibiotic-, hormonally pumped livestock or farmed fish that is fed grain

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than grasses or algae, which are its native foods—can send the wrong

<!-- chunk -->

### signals to our bodies.


<!-- chunk -->

### Our cells see these foods, which are a far cry from what we evolved to eat,

<!-- chunk -->

### as foreign.“What’s this?” our cells say.“Something foreign? Something

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous? Let’s get in gear by activating the stress response.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The stress response in our body created by “foreign” molecules in food is

<!-- chunk -->

### called xenohormesis. The concept of xenohormesis


<!-- chunk -->

### describes the effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### these foreign molecules on our biology. They produce a stress response

<!-- chunk -->

### triggering the whole cascade of stress-related cellular signals that makes us sick.

<!-- chunk -->

### This causes obesity and brain dysfunction. And it appears that there is a

<!-- chunk -->

### close connection between the obesity epidemic we are seeing and the epidemic

<!-- chunk -->

### of ADHD and behavior problems in children.


<!-- chunk -->

### Not only do we need to think of the nutrients in our food, but we also need

<!-- chunk -->

### to think about its quality. Are there “stress” molecules in our food that is raised

<!-- chunk -->

### on industrial feedlots and farms, which make us fat, depressed, and inattentive?

<!-- chunk -->

### What kind of information does the food we eat send to our bodies?

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress Stresses Out Your Genes

<!-- chunk -->

### Not only can stressed food cause stress in the person who eats it, but food

<!-- chunk -->

### also triggers changes in our genes that lead to more stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### One remarkable study in the American Journal of Clinician Nutrition found

<!-- chunk -->

### that stress genes, inflammation genes, and insulin resistance genes were all

<!-- chunk -->

### turned on in people who ate more refined (not total) carbohydrates.


<!-- chunk -->

### The study looked at two groups of people, both with insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

### They were fed two diets that were exactly the same—the same calories and the

<!-- chunk -->

### same amount of protein, carbohydrates, fat, and fiber.

<!-- chunk -->

### The only difference was that in one group the carbohydrate source was

<!-- chunk -->

### wheat, oats, and potatoes, and in the other it was rye. Rye contains different

<!-- chunk -->

### information molecules (phytonutrients) and is absorbed and broken down more

<!-- chunk -->

### slowly than carbohydrates from wheat, oats, and potatoes.

<!-- chunk -->

### What happened was nothing short of revolutionary in its implications.

<!-- chunk -->

### After twelve weeks, fat biopsies were taken and changes in gene expression

<!-- chunk -->

### were measured. There was no change in weight, but the difference in gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression was extraordinary.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the wheat, oat, and potato group, sixty-two genes that promote

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, produce stress molecules and hormones, and promote insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance and obesity were “turned on.” In the rye group, seventy-one genes that

<!-- chunk -->

### improve insulin function and prevent cell death were “turned on.”

<!-- chunk -->

### It appears that obesity is not the only thing controlled by the information in

<!-- chunk -->

### our food. So are our stress response, mood, behavior, memory, and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function. That is why a fresh, whole-foods, organic, real-food diet is the

<!-- chunk -->

### foundation of health and The UltraMind Solution.

# Saying Ouch: The Pain of Thoughts, Foreign Food,

# Toxins, Infections, or Allergens

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, the body has only so many ways of saying ouch. One major way

<!-- chunk -->

### the body says “ouch” is the activation of the stress response. How can this

<!-- chunk -->

### response be turned on?

<!-- chunk -->

### Well, it is the result of many different insults.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking everything personally, any negative thought or perception, or rigid

<!-- chunk -->

### beliefs or attitudes can trigger the stress response. That is how our experience of

<!-- chunk -->

### the world creates illness and damages our brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### But every other input into your world—an imbalance in any of the other six

<!-- chunk -->

### key systems in your body—can initiate that same response.

<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t have to think bad thoughts to set the stress response in motion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just breathe in the fumes from a coal-burning power plant, eat beef grown on a

<!-- chunk -->

### feedlot, take antibiotics, and change the ecology of your gut, which will then do

<!-- chunk -->

### the negative talking for you, or be a military recruit on a forced march and don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep for five days.

<!-- chunk -->

### All these things, and anything that creates nutritional imbalances, hormonal

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, inflammation, digestive imbalances, any toxin, or anything that

<!-- chunk -->

### messes up your energy production, will all cause an activation of the stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response.

<!-- chunk -->

### This type of thinking is foreign to medicine and difficult for most of us to

<!-- chunk -->

### grasp. We are always looking for that one thing, that one factor we can blame

<!-- chunk -->

### and say aha! That’s it. But that will never happen.

<!-- chunk -->

### We will never find the magic bullet—whether it is a new food like the acai

<!-- chunk -->

### berry, or a vitamin, or a new drug or pill that will solve our chronic health issues

<!-- chunk -->

### or the epidemic of mood, behavior, attention, and neurodegenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### The World Health Organization estimates that depression affects about

<!-- chunk -->

### million people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability (as measured in

<!-- chunk -->

### years living with disability [YLDs]),


<!-- chunk -->

### accounting for almost 12 percent of all

<!-- chunk -->

### disability.


<!-- chunk -->

### By the year 2025, it is estimated that major depression will be the second

<!-- chunk -->

### leading cause of medical disability in America.

<!-- chunk -->

### A different type of thinking is necessary to solve this problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everything is connected. We are one wholistic system and we need to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the ecology of our body. We are an ecosystem connected locally and

<!-- chunk -->

### globally to everything that happens. Only by understanding and working on all

<!-- chunk -->

### the imbalances in these systems can we hope to regain our health, vitality,

<!-- chunk -->

### energy, and our clearheadedness and happiness.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is my hope for all of you in offering the plan in The UltraMind


# Relax Your Stressed-Out Body-Mind

<!-- chunk -->

### The hardest part of being a doctor is helping people connect to why they

<!-- chunk -->

### want to heal. Knowing what to do comes fairly easily to me now. I have a new

<!-- chunk -->

### road map, a new way of navigating through the astounding mystery of our

<!-- chunk -->

### biology. But my challenge is always to help people to connect to meaning.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is it they treasure? What anchors them to life? Who and what is worth

<!-- chunk -->

### living for? How can they connect to meaning and purpose? The development of

<!-- chunk -->

### a sense of place in the world, a sense of connection, belonging, and contribution

<!-- chunk -->

### must be nurtured and fed. That is the most important diet: meaning and purpose.

<!-- chunk -->

### There begins healing. In our world, we have to be particularly vigilant to

<!-- chunk -->

### nurture connection, community, and meaning, because so many forces conspire

<!-- chunk -->

### to distract us from ourselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part of the problem is the runaway stress response. Once activated, it

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t turn itself off. This produces all the damage we explored in this chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fortunately, we can learn to turn it off and activate the relaxation response.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can turn on your vagus nerve every day and you don’t need a pacemaker

<!-- chunk -->

### implanted in your neck to do it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning to relax will stop the vicious cycle that keeps you from waking up

<!-- chunk -->

### and being present to your life. It will allow you to slow down long enough to

<!-- chunk -->

### consider how you might nurture compassion in your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III (see page 285) and IV (see page 343) I will show you how to

<!-- chunk -->

### transform the effects of stress from any insult—physical or psychological. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, I will give you a specific plan to achieve that goal.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III, you will learn the basic, six-week program for a healthy brain, a

<!-- chunk -->

### kind of owner’s manual for your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Then in Part IV, I will teach you how to fine-tune that plan based on your

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in the seven keys we have been exploring.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now you have seen how all the seven keys influence your brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### biology. It is one interconnected web of problems. And because it is all

<!-- chunk -->

### connected, you can make a few simple changes that can have dramatic and life-

<!-- chunk -->

### changing effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simple dietary changes, a few nutrients, a little exercise, enough sleep, and

<!-- chunk -->

### a little time each day for activating the relaxation response can transform deep-

<!-- chunk -->

### seated symptoms that show up as altered mood, behavior, attention, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your brain can thrive. You just have to provide the right conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the rest of the book I am going to teach you those conditions.

# PART III

# The UltraMind Solution


# THE SIX-WEEK BASIC BRAIN-

# BOOSTING PROGRAM FOR EVERYONE:

# A SIMPLE APPROACH TO OPTIMAL

# BRAIN FUNCTION AND HEALTH


<!-- chunk -->

### In six short weeks you will learn more about your body and brain than you

<!-- chunk -->

### ever imagined.

<!-- chunk -->

### You have in your hands the tools to immediately transform your health and

<!-- chunk -->

### well-being. Using the six-week brain-boosting program you are about to learn,

<!-- chunk -->

### you may:

<!-- chunk -->

### Feel more alert and focused

<!-- chunk -->

### Experience a more stable mood

<!-- chunk -->

### Develop a better memory

<!-- chunk -->

### Increase your attention

<!-- chunk -->

### Feel more energy

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep better

<!-- chunk -->

### Get rid of chronic sinus and digestive problems

<!-- chunk -->

### Eliminate joint pains

<!-- chunk -->

### Wipe out headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### Lose weight

<!-- chunk -->

### Create optimal brain function

<!-- chunk -->

### You will do this simply by changing your diet, taking a few brain-boosting

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, and making some lifestyle changes that will not only improve your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain health but will make you feel better physically as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### I know it’s hard to believe a few simple changes can make such a

<!-- chunk -->

### difference.

<!-- chunk -->

### So I don’t want you to believe me.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prove it to yourself.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you can suspend your disbelief for just six weeks and follow the program

<!-- chunk -->

### I suggest in the following chapters, belief will become irrelevant. You will

<!-- chunk -->

### experience a dramatic change in your health, your mood, and your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function. This will prove to you that change can happen now! Most of my

<!-- chunk -->

### patients who follow this approach see significant changes within the first two

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you go through the six-week program and experience no change, then

<!-- chunk -->

### you have lost nothing—except perhaps the chance to have a few cheese-burgers

<!-- chunk -->

### and Cokes.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, if you go through the six-week program and experience

<!-- chunk -->

### the changes listed above (including weight loss), you will have gained something

<!-- chunk -->

### extraordinary—a new understanding of your mind and body and the tools and

<!-- chunk -->

### skills to achieve UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### What I hope for all of you is that you can experience the connection

<!-- chunk -->

### between your behaviors, your choices, your habits, things you put in your mouth,

<!-- chunk -->

### and how you feel right now.

<!-- chunk -->

### How can we know that eating wheat, or not liking fish, or eating too much

<!-- chunk -->

### blue fin sushi, or staying out of the sun and using sunblock are making us

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed, anxious, or demented? The only way is to change our habits and pay

<!-- chunk -->

### attention to what happens.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is what this six-week program is designed to help you do.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the changes you experience will happen almost immediately. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you are gluten-sensitive and you stop eating gluten, within a week your life will

<!-- chunk -->

### change. If you are B


<!-- chunk -->

### -deficient and you take B


<!-- chunk -->

### , you will improve your mood

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain function in a few weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other changes may take a little longer to achieve. If you are mercury toxic,

<!-- chunk -->

### then it may take a few years and some hard work to fully recover, but you can

<!-- chunk -->

### regain your health and renew your brain. I did.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whatever the case, I will guide you to discovering the potential you have

<!-- chunk -->

### for a fully engaged, happy, purposeful, awake, and attentive life step-by-step in

<!-- chunk -->

### Parts III and IV.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part III, you will learn the brain essentials! This is just basic maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### 101: the raw ingredients everyone needs to detoxify, repair, and renew their

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. Everyone reading this book should go on this basic six-week plan,

<!-- chunk -->

### regardless of your circumstances.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part IV, you can customize your six-week plan based on how you scored

<!-- chunk -->

### on the quizzes in Part II. If your score indicated a care plan that included “Self-

<!-- chunk -->

### Care” or “Medical Care” in any of the keys, simply add the steps in Part IV for

<!-- chunk -->

### each of those keys to the six-week plan to optimize it for your needs. I will teach

<!-- chunk -->

### you more about how to do this in Part IV.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your quiz score qualified you for “Medical Care,” you may need the help

<!-- chunk -->

### of a doctor trained in Functional and/or Integrative Medicine to help you

<!-- chunk -->

### navigate the testing and treatment options, particularly in the realm of hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy, gut healing, treating infections, and heavy metal detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### But for most of you, 70 to 80 percent of the benefits from the UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution can be reached on your own with a few simple changes in diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional supplementation, and lifestyle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s how you do it.

# What Is the Six-Week Basic Brain-Boosting Program?

<!-- chunk -->

### The six-week plan consists of four basic components. These are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. A healthy eating plan designed to help you heal and optimize your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Basic supplements you need to take to balance and enhance your brain

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Lifestyle changes including exercise, relaxation, sleep, and “brain” or

<!-- chunk -->

### mental exercises.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Living clean and green to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### and support a sustainable future for us all.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is a six-week program, with a one-week preparation phase. All four

<!-- chunk -->

### elements above are incorporated in this easy-to-follow, step-by-step system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s review how it works.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Preparation Phase—One Week Before the Program Starts

<!-- chunk -->

### We are often locked into habits without recognizing their effect on us. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### of us are drug addicts and don’t realize it. Sugar, junk food, caffeine, and alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### all affect our ability to function, and though they temporarily make us feel better,

<!-- chunk -->

### they often deplete us in a deeper way.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking a “drug holiday” is an important way to discover how you really feel

<!-- chunk -->

### and give yourself the opportunity to tune into your own body’s signals for

<!-- chunk -->

### hunger, sleep, and relaxation. Getting off sugar, high-fructose corn syrup,

<!-- chunk -->

### hydrogenated fats or trans fats, junk food, alcohol, and caffeine for one week, in

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, is powerful enough to totally change your health and your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take a risk and try it out. Even if you do nothing else, this will change your

<!-- chunk -->

### life.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Six-Week Plan: Developing an UltraMind

### Once you are finished with the preparation week, you will move into the six-

<!-- chunk -->

### week program for healing and optimizing your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The key component of the program is cleaning up your diet. Getting rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### garbage foods, moving toward a diet of whole, unprocessed foods, and

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating foods that you may have sensitivities or delayed allergies to will help

<!-- chunk -->

### you start the process of healing your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend everyone take a six-week holiday from gluten and dairy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten and dairy are the two major food allergens that most often lead to brain

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction, and eliminating them for six weeks (as you will during this

<!-- chunk -->

### program) may cause remarkable improvements in the health of your brain (not to

<!-- chunk -->

### mention your body).

<!-- chunk -->

### You will also eliminate sugar, processed and toxic foods, and you will

<!-- chunk -->

### introduce whole, healing foods into your diet. The purpose of doing so is to

<!-- chunk -->

### show you just how great you can feel by simply changing what you eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part of the healing occurs because of all the junk you are eliminating, but

<!-- chunk -->

### most occurs because you introduce delicious, whole real foods. Doing so will

<!-- chunk -->

### help rebuild the very structure and function of your brain.

# SPECIAL NOTE FOR THOSE WHO ARE VERY INFLAMED

<!-- chunk -->

### For those who scored high on the inflammation quiz in chapter 8, I

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend a more comprehensive food allergy elimination program in

<!-- chunk -->

### Part IV that may help cure more dramatic brain problems caused by


<!-- chunk -->

### During the program you will start to reeducate your body-mind and

<!-- chunk -->

### reprogram your brain with improved mood, attention, memory, and behavior. By

<!-- chunk -->

### doing so you will build the foundation for lifelong healthy brain function and

<!-- chunk -->

### balanced moods, and prevent most of the age-related brain conditions such as

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the six weeks you will stick to the whole foods healthy-eating

<!-- chunk -->

### plan, I hope, for life. However, you can reintegrate gluten and dairy

<!-- chunk -->

### systematically once the program is done to test for sensitivities you may have to

<!-- chunk -->

### them. I will explain how to do that in chapter 20.

<!-- chunk -->

### By reintroducing these foods the way I describe, you can monitor their

<!-- chunk -->

### effects on your health. (If you get a stomachache or your nose stuffs up when

<!-- chunk -->

### you eat dairy, or you feel tired and depressed if you eat gluten, it is best to stay

<!-- chunk -->

### away from them.)

<!-- chunk -->

### The six-week program is really just a start for the rest of your life. Variety,

<!-- chunk -->

### fun, nourishment, pleasure, color, and wholeness are essential for making this

<!-- chunk -->

### way of eating your way of eating for life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Feel free to improvise and adapt—just stick with whole real foods and you

<!-- chunk -->

### will have difficulty getting into trouble.

<!-- chunk -->

### By the end of seven weeks (one week preparation, six weeks of the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind program) you may have more energy, feel more emotionally

<!-- chunk -->

### balanced, more alert, focused, and mentally sharper. UltraWellness is now yours.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next few chapters will give you an overview of the healthy-eating plan,

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, and lifestyle changes you need to make during the program. They

<!-- chunk -->

### will also tell you how to set the stage for success, and teach you how to stay on

<!-- chunk -->

### the program.

<!-- chunk -->

### Read through them. Then simply follow the guidelines and checklists in

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter 19 to take advantage of the UltraMind Solution.


# EATING RIGHT FOR YOUR BRAIN: A

# SCIENCE-BASED, WHOLE-FOODS

# APPROACH TO EATING—FOOD AS

# MEDICINE


<!-- chunk -->

### The most powerful tool you have to transform your health and improve your

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, mind, and metabolism is your fork! Use it well and you will thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Choose poorly and you will suffer.

<!-- chunk -->

### The varied components of a whole-foods diet not only taste better, make

<!-- chunk -->

### you feel better, and prevent disease, but they are literally medicine. Mounting

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific evidence points to the power of food as medicine. These “medicinal”

<!-- chunk -->

### foods are simply the foods our bodies evolved eating— fresh, unadulterated,

<!-- chunk -->

### slow-burning, high-fiber, vitamin-and mineral-rich, omega-3 plentiful, and

<!-- chunk -->

### phytonutrient-dense foods.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why we can treat and prevent most chronic illnesses with a whole,

<!-- chunk -->

### organic, real, unprocessed diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains,

<!-- chunk -->

### beans, nuts, and seeds, small omega-3–containing fish like sardines and herring,

<!-- chunk -->

### and lean animal protein. It is a one-stop shopping method for dealing with

<!-- chunk -->

### everything.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, all nutritional science is converging on a few basic concepts, which

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone agrees on. These are the principles the six-week UltraMind Solution is

<!-- chunk -->

### based on:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Eat whole, real, fresh, organic, unprocessed food.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Eat a lot of fruit and vegetables full of colorful phytonutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Eat foods with plenty of fiber.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Eat foods containing omega-3 fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you follow these four principles, then you are doing 90 percent of what

<!-- chunk -->

### you need to do to stay healthy and heal your brain. The rest are small

<!-- chunk -->

### refinements and details.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will automatically be eating this way as long as you follow the eating

<!-- chunk -->

### plan in this program. I will discuss more about what kinds of foods to include in

<!-- chunk -->

### a moment.

<!-- chunk -->

### But keep in mind that what is omitted is just as important as what’s

<!-- chunk -->

### included.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you want to realize the full potential of the UltraMind Solution to

<!-- chunk -->

### transform your health and your brain in six weeks, the first step is to temporarily

<!-- chunk -->

### stop all factors that have been shown to cause brain damage.

# Stopping the Brain Damage: Foods to Avoid on the

# UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Give your brain a break for six weeks from known brain-damaging

<!-- chunk -->

### substances. If you think there will be nothing left to eat, then you will have the

<!-- chunk -->

### biggest gains to achieve in making a change. Please avoid foods in any of the

<!-- chunk -->

### following categories.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sugars in Any Form

<!-- chunk -->

### High-fructose corn syrup

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar-laden foods

<!-- chunk -->

### Candy, cookies, cereals, pastries, pies, etc., including honey, maple syrup,

<!-- chunk -->

### or molasses

<!-- chunk -->

### Flour products, all types of flour

<!-- chunk -->

### Bagels, breads, rolls, wraps, pastas, etc.

<!-- chunk -->

### Liquid sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### Processed fruit juices, which are often loaded with sugars. Try juicing

<!-- chunk -->

### your own carrots, celery, and beets instead, or other fruit and vegetable

<!-- chunk -->

### combinations

<!-- chunk -->

### Sodas or any type of canned or bottled drinks with any type of sugar or

<!-- chunk -->

### sweetener

<!-- chunk -->

### Artificial sweeteners

<!-- chunk -->

### Equal; aspartame—NutraSweet; saccharin-Sweet N’ Low; sucralose-

<!-- chunk -->

### Splenda; acesulfame-K-Sunette, Sweet-n-Safe, Sweet One; neotame

<!-- chunk -->

### Stevia (a natural plant-based sweetner, yes, but it still tricks your body

<!-- chunk -->

### into craving more and eating more)

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar alcohols

<!-- chunk -->

### Polyols such as mannitol, sorbitol, lactitol, malitol, xylitol, etc. These can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause significant gas and bloating.

<!-- chunk -->

## Toxic Fats

<!-- chunk -->

### Trans or hydrogenated fats (found in most crackers, chips, cakes, candies,

<!-- chunk -->

### cookies, doughnuts, and processed cheese)

<!-- chunk -->

### Processed oils such as corn, safflower, sunflower, peanut, and canola

<!-- chunk -->

### Fat substitutes (Olean and Salatrim/Benefat)

<!-- chunk -->

### Fried foods

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Additives and Chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### Any food in a box, can, or package; in other words, if it has a label don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### eat it

<!-- chunk -->

### Artificial colorings

<!-- chunk -->

### Any food additives

<!-- chunk -->

### Potassium bromate, propyl gallate, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate,

<!-- chunk -->

### monosodium glutamate, etc.

<!-- chunk -->

### Check out the Center for Science in the Public Interest’s website for further

<!-- chunk -->

### information and updates: www.cspinet.org/reports/chemcuisine.htm.

<!-- chunk -->

## Toxin Rich Foods

<!-- chunk -->

### Red meats (unless organic or grass-fed) and organ meats (liver, thymus or

<!-- chunk -->

### sweetbreads, and kidneys)

<!-- chunk -->

### Large predatory fish and river fish, including swordfish, tuna, tilefish, and

<!-- chunk -->

### shark, which contain mercury and other contaminants in unacceptable

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid the fruits and vegetables with the highest toxin load. Here are the

<!-- chunk -->

### ten worst offenders: peaches, apples, sweet bell peppers, celery,

<!-- chunk -->

### nectarines, strawberries, cherries, lettuce, grapes, and pears. (See

<!-- chunk -->

### www.foodnews.org for a list of low-and high-pesticide containing foods.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Choose only organic versions of the fruits and vegetables noted above, as

<!-- chunk -->

### their conventionally farmed counterparts have the highest toxic burden.

<!-- chunk -->

## Addictions

<!-- chunk -->

### Caffeine (sodas, coffee, tea)

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the primary foods you will avoid during the program. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is another critically important group of foods you will avoid as well. These

<!-- chunk -->

### are the foods that are most likely giving you brain allergies.

# Brain “Allergies”: How the Six-Week Plan Will Help

# Clear Your Head

<!-- chunk -->

### The stresses of our modern, toxic, genetically altered, nutrient-depleted diet;

<!-- chunk -->

### the stress of our lives; and the overuse of antibiotics and other gut-damaging

<!-- chunk -->

### stresses have led many modern humans to suffer from delayed or hidden food

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies. This is the result of a leaky gut. (See chapters 8 and 9 for a refresher on

<!-- chunk -->

### food allergies.)

<!-- chunk -->

### A leaky gut leads to brain “allergies.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Clearing up these brain allergies can

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatically impact your mood, attention, and behavior, and may resolve a

<!-- chunk -->

### laundry list of symptoms, including digestive, allergic, autoimmune, and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The only way to know what you are allergic to (aside from medical IgE and

<!-- chunk -->

### IgG allergy testing) is to eliminate certain substances from your diet and then

<!-- chunk -->

### systematically add them back in. This is called an elimination/ reintroduction

<!-- chunk -->

### diet, and it is a critical part of the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### The concept is simple. If you get rid of the foods that commonly cause bad

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions, you may feel better and you can heal. If you add them back and you

<!-- chunk -->

### get sick, you know you have a problem with them.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common and most serious undiagnosed immune or toxic reactions

<!-- chunk -->

### are to gluten and dairy (especially the casein, and not so much the whey

<!-- chunk -->

### component, of dairy). These are also the main allergens and foods that cause bad

<!-- chunk -->

### brain reactions. Stopping these foods can be life changing for the majority with

<!-- chunk -->

### brain or mood problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The inflammation and toxic effects of these otherwise harmless and often

<!-- chunk -->

### healthful foods are so powerful in derailing our brain function that they can lead

<!-- chunk -->

### to everything from brain fog, to depression, to ADHD, autism, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why I recommend a short holiday from these two worst offenders,

<!-- chunk -->

### which are unfortunately the staples in our diet. During the six-week program you

<!-- chunk -->

### will eliminate the following foods in addition to those listed above:

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten (from wheat, barley, rye, spelt, kamut, triticale, and oats)

<!-- chunk -->

### And dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt, sour cream, ice cream)

<!-- chunk -->

### This means a complete 100 percent elimination of all gluten, no exceptions

<!-- chunk -->

### (not even a crumb), and all dairy foods (not even a drop in your tea) for a full six

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is enough time to feel better, and notice a change. And it is long

<!-- chunk -->

### enough that when you add it back, you will immediately see how you react to it.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the program, I will teach you how to systematically

<!-- chunk -->

### reintegrate gluten and dairy and test for reactions to see if they are contributing

<!-- chunk -->

### to your mental and brain problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### But be warned: gluten and dairy (or other hidden allergens) may not cause

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms for up to three days after eating them. That is why careful

<!-- chunk -->

### reintroduction of these foods and monitoring how you feel for three days is

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### In some cases, you may have to eliminate some foods you are sensitive to

<!-- chunk -->

### for a longer period of time or avoid them altogether if you want to maintain an

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind. I will explain all of this in more detail later, when I talk about food

<!-- chunk -->

### reintroduction.

<!-- chunk -->

### The beauty of an elimination/reintroduction diet is that it gives you the

<!-- chunk -->

### power of knowledge—the power to know whether these items are contributing

<!-- chunk -->

### to your mental-health problems. Then you can make choices about what you eat

<!-- chunk -->

### and what you avoid based on your experience with food and how it affects you.

# THE TOP FOOD ALLERGENS

<!-- chunk -->

### While gluten and dairy are the most important allergens that lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### brain problems, there are a few other common allergens that may

<!-- chunk -->

### contribute to your health problems as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, since these are not the most important or as common in

<!-- chunk -->

### creating brain problems, I have not addressed them in this program.

<!-- chunk -->

### For an in-depth discussion of delayed food allergies and a

<!-- chunk -->

### comprehensive elimination diet, see The UltraSimple Diet. The following

<!-- chunk -->

### list constitutes the staples of the American diet. It is also what we typically

<!-- chunk -->

### become allergic to if we have leaky gut lining.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you do not experience relief by following the six-week program in

<!-- chunk -->

### this book just eliminating gluten and dairy from your diet, there may be

<!-- chunk -->

### other hidden culprits. Blood testing for IgG food allergens

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.immunolabs.com and other labs) may help you identify more

<!-- chunk -->

### uncommon foods that are responsible for symptoms. Or you can go on a

<!-- chunk -->

### more comprehensive elimination/reintroduction diet like the one outlined

<!-- chunk -->

### in The UltraSimple Diet to help you.

<!-- chunk -->

### The top food allergens are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten (barley, rye, oats, spelt, kamut, wheat, triticale—see

<!-- chunk -->

### www.celiac.com for a complete list of foods containing gluten, as well as often

<!-- chunk -->

### surprising and hidden sources of gluten—salad dressing, soup, beer, etc.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Dairy (milk, cheese, butter, yogurt)

<!-- chunk -->

### Eggs

<!-- chunk -->

### Yeasted products (wine, vinegar, breads)

<!-- chunk -->

### Corn

<!-- chunk -->

### Peanuts

<!-- chunk -->

### Nightshades (tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, potatoes)

<!-- chunk -->

### Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits, etc.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Soy

<!-- chunk -->

### A few others deserve honorable mention but are not as common. They

<!-- chunk -->

### are chocolate, tree nuts, vinegar, and shellfish.

# What Should I Eat and How Should I Eat? The

# Principles of the UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Now you know what not to eat and what foods you are going to avoid for the

<!-- chunk -->

### six-week program. The next step is to understand what you are going to eat and

<!-- chunk -->

### how you are going to eat it.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the sections that follow I have outlined the basic principles of what to eat

<!-- chunk -->

### on the six-week program. These are important eating guidelines you will want to

<!-- chunk -->

### integrate for a lifetime if you are going to achieve UltraWellness. As long as you

<!-- chunk -->

### follow these guidelines, you will work through the six weeks without a problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind these are just the principles. I have developed a full six-week

<!-- chunk -->

### eating plan complete with lists of foods you can include on the program, tips on

<!-- chunk -->

### how to cook, shopping lists, and a set of delicious recipes in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide. If you want to make your experience on the

<!-- chunk -->

### program even easier, go to www.ultramind.com/guide and download the guide

<!-- chunk -->

### for the complete eating plan.

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Quality: Feed Your Brain Right

<!-- chunk -->

### If food is information and your brain runs on the right information, then

<!-- chunk -->

### clearly just getting enough calories in a day is not enough. The quality of those

<!-- chunk -->

### calories will determine the quality of your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember your health is also connected to the health of the planet. You can

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce the “carbon footprint” of your diet and transform your health at the same

<!-- chunk -->

### time. What you put on your fork has broad impact not only on your health but on

<!-- chunk -->

### agriculture, energy consumption, the environment, politics, and the economy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are the principles of choosing quality food. They are in order of

<!-- chunk -->

### importance:

<!-- chunk -->

## Real —Choose real, whole, unprocessed fresh foods in as close to their

<!-- chunk -->

### natural state as possible—fresh vegetables, fruit, whole grains, beans,

<!-- chunk -->

### nuts, seeds, lean animal protein such as small fish, chicken, and eggs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Clean —Choose grass-fed,

*

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotic-, hormone-, and pesticide-free

<!-- chunk -->

### animal products.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organic —Choose organic fruits and vegetables to reduce the toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of pesticides on your brain, and also your thyroid and your sex

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, which are very sensitive to the effects of low-level toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Local —Eat local foods that are in season. Frequent your local farmers’

<!-- chunk -->

### market or consider joining your local community-supported agriculture

<!-- chunk -->

### projects. Learn more at

www.localharvest.org/csa


<!-- chunk -->

### These are the principles I used when I designed the six-week eating plan in

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide. Go to

www.ultramind.com

<!-- chunk -->

### / guide to

<!-- chunk -->

### download the free guide.

<!-- chunk -->

## When Should I Eat? The Importance of Meal Timing

<!-- chunk -->

### Controlling insulin and balancing your blood sugar are critical for balancing

<!-- chunk -->

### your mood, focusing, having energy, and preventing all the age-related brain

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases such as Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is not very hard. Besides avoiding flour and sugar products, eating

<!-- chunk -->

### smaller, more frequent meals keeps your blood sugar even and prevents swings

<!-- chunk -->

### in energy, mood, and appetite. Not only will your anxiety and depression

<!-- chunk -->

### improve, but you will also automatically lose weight.

<!-- chunk -->

## Meal Timing

<!-- chunk -->

### For breakfast every day eat protein such as whole omega-3 eggs, soy or

<!-- chunk -->

### rice protein shakes, and nut butters. (See www.ultramind.com/guide for

<!-- chunk -->

### recipe ideas.) Beside controlling your appetite and helping you lose

<!-- chunk -->

### weight, protein in the morning provides the amino acids necessary to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce all the neurotransmitters needed for optimal brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat something every four hours to keep your insulin and glucose levels

<!-- chunk -->

### normal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat a small protein snack in the morning and afternoon such as a handful

<!-- chunk -->

### of almonds.

<!-- chunk -->

### When possible, avoid eating during the two to three hours before you go

<!-- chunk -->

### to bed. If you have a snack earlier in the day, you won’t be as hungry and

<!-- chunk -->

### eat as much later in the day.

<!-- chunk -->

### The daily eating plan and checklists in chapter 19 that lay out the six-week

<!-- chunk -->

### program follow this schedule step-by-step. As long as you follow that plan, you

<!-- chunk -->

### will be eating your meals when you should for optimal brain and body health.

<!-- chunk -->

## How Should I Eat? The Importance of Meal Composition

<!-- chunk -->

### Composing the perfect meal is essential. To do that, just choose something

<!-- chunk -->

### from each of the whole-food categories below—carbohydrates, fats, and protein.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or you can go to www.ultramind.com/guide and download The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide for a complete six-week eating plan, including

<!-- chunk -->

### recipes that are composed based on the standards outlined below.

<!-- chunk -->

## Becoming a Fat Head

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 fats are the most important building blocks for a healthy brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. It can take a year to rebuild and remake all your cells and tissues with the

<!-- chunk -->

### right fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cold-water fish such as wild salmon, sardines, herring, small halibut, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sable (black cod) contain an abundance of beneficial omega-3 essential

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids that reduce inflammation. A great source of smaller, wild

<!-- chunk -->

### Alaskan salmon, sable, and halibut (all high in omega-3 fats and low in

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins) is available from www.vitalchoice.com.

<!-- chunk -->

### Canned wild salmon, sardines, or herring (kippers) are great emergency

<!-- chunk -->

### foods full of safe omega-3 fats and choline for your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat omega-3 eggs, which contain a safe form of DHA. You can enjoy up

<!-- chunk -->

### to eight eggs a week. Eggs also are a rich source of choline for your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use extra-virgin olive oil, which contains anti-inflammatory and

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant phytochemicals. It should be your main oil except for high-

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature cooking.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use unrefined or expeller pressed sesame oil for high-temperature

<!-- chunk -->

### cooking.

<!-- chunk -->

## Protein for Brain Power

<!-- chunk -->

### To make neurotransmitters you need amino acids. And amino acids come

<!-- chunk -->

### from the protein you eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research, including T. Colin Campbell’s China Study,

2;3

<!-- chunk -->

### points to the risks

<!-- chunk -->

### of too much animal protein. Each person is different and thrives on different

<!-- chunk -->

### types of food. Some do fantastic as vegans, others wither. Some thrive on animal

<!-- chunk -->

### protein, some are sluggish and sick. Find the right balance for you by

<!-- chunk -->

### experimenting.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it is essential to choose protein at each meal. Choose from these high-

<!-- chunk -->

### quality safe sources of protein.

<!-- chunk -->

### Beans or legumes, including whole, traditional soy products such as

<!-- chunk -->

### edamame, tofu, and tempeh

<!-- chunk -->

### Nuts (almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans)

<!-- chunk -->

### Seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, flax, chia, etc.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 eggs

<!-- chunk -->

### Safe, mercury-free fish as above

<!-- chunk -->

### Organic, grass-fed, hormone-, antibiotic-, and pesticide-free poultry

<!-- chunk -->

### Small amounts of lean, organic grass-fed, hormone-, and antibiotic-free

<!-- chunk -->

### lamb or beef (or try buffalo, venison, or ostrich, which are leaner) no

<!-- chunk -->

### more than once or twice a week and no more than four to six ounces per

<!-- chunk -->

### serving

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid excessive quantities of meat. Use lean, organic, or grass-fed (when

<!-- chunk -->

### possible) animal products—eggs, beef, chicken, lamb, buffalo, ostrich,

<!-- chunk -->

### etc. There are good sources at Whole Foods or other local health-food

<!-- chunk -->

### stores. (Also see the mail-order resources in The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Companion Guide. You can access it by going to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Brain Food: The Right Carbs

<!-- chunk -->

### Carbohydrates are the most essential part of your diet for long-term health

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain function. But not the doughnuts, bagels, and sweets we typically think

<!-- chunk -->

### of as carbs. These are highly processed foods, stripped of their nutrients and

<!-- chunk -->

### fiber.

<!-- chunk -->

### When I say carbohydrates, I mean real, whole plant foods containing all the

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients that create health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Create meals high in low-glycemic legumes such as lentils, chick-peas,

<!-- chunk -->

### and soybeans (try edamame, the Japanese soybeans in a pod, quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### steamed with a little salt, as a snack). These foods slow the release of

<!-- chunk -->

### sugars into the bloodstream, helping to prevent excess insulin release

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to insulin resistance and its related health concerns, including

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, depression, poor heart health, obesity, high blood pressure,

<!-- chunk -->

### high LDL or “bad” cholesterol, and low HDL or “good” cholesterol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat a cornucopia of fresh fruits and vegetables teeming with

<!-- chunk -->

### phytonutrients—carotenoids, flavonoids, and polyphenols— associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with a lower incidence of nearly all health problems, including dementia,

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity, and aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use more slow-burning, low-glycemic vegetables such as asparagus,

<!-- chunk -->

### broccoli, kale, spinach, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Berries, cherries, peaches, plums, rhubarb, pears, and apples are optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### fruits; cantaloupes and melons, grapes and kiwifruit are suitable;

<!-- chunk -->

### however, they contain more sugar. Organic frozen berries (from

<!-- chunk -->

### Cascadian Farms) can be used if you make protein shakes (this is a good

<!-- chunk -->

### way to get protein in the morning).

<!-- chunk -->

### A diet high in fiber further helps to stabilize blood sugar by slowing the

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption of carbohydrates and supports a healthy digestive tract. Try to

<!-- chunk -->

### gradually increase fiber to 30 to 50 gm a day and use predominantly

<!-- chunk -->

### soluble or viscous fiber (legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, vegetables,

<!-- chunk -->

### and fruit), which slows sugar absorption from the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### Minimize starchy, high-glycemic cooked vegetables, such as potatoes,

<!-- chunk -->

### corn, and root vegetables, such as rutabagas, parsnips, and turnips.

# CONTROLLING YOUR GLYCEMIC LOAD

<!-- chunk -->

### The glycemic load of a food or meal is defined as the total effect that

<!-- chunk -->

### food or meal has on your blood sugar. The food or meals you eat can have

<!-- chunk -->

### either a high glycemic load or a low glycemic load.

<!-- chunk -->

### Controlling the glycemic load of your meals is essential. It is easy to do.

<!-- chunk -->

### Simply combine adequate protein, fats, and whole-food carbohydrates

<!-- chunk -->

### from vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and fruit at every meal or snack. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is most important to avoid eating quickly absorbed carbohydrates alone, as

<!-- chunk -->

### they raise your sugar and insulin levels. And any large meal will raise your

<!-- chunk -->

### blood sugar, so smaller meals help keep your blood sugar even.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phytonutrients—Hidden Brain Protectors: Healing Anti-inflammatory,

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant, and Detoxifying Foods

<!-- chunk -->

### Healing chemicals in foods may, in the end, be more important than the

<!-- chunk -->

### protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals they contain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Practically the only thing everyone agrees about in nutrition is that eating

<!-- chunk -->

### five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day can reduce your risk from

<!-- chunk -->

### almost every known disease of our “modern” civilization, including heart

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and all of the brain and mood disorders so

<!-- chunk -->

### many suffer from.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the reasons phytonutrients are so powerful has to do with their anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory, antioxidant, and detoxifying properties. To get enough

<!-- chunk -->

### phytonutrients in your diet, try the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### Focus on anti-inflammatory foods, including wild fish and other sources

<!-- chunk -->

### of omega-3 fats, red and purple berries (these are rich in polyphenols),

<!-- chunk -->

### dark green leafy vegetables, orange sweet potatoes, and nuts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat more antioxidant-rich and energy-boosting foods, including orange

<!-- chunk -->

### and yellow vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables (kale, collards,

<!-- chunk -->

### spinach, etc.), anthocyanidins (berries, beets, grapes, pomegranate),

<!-- chunk -->

### purple grapes containing trans-resveratrol, blueberries, bilberries,

<!-- chunk -->

### cranberries, and cherries. In fact, antioxidants are in all colorful fruits and

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetables.

<!-- chunk -->

### Include detoxifying foods in your diet such as cruciferous vegetables

<!-- chunk -->

### (broccoli, kale, collards, brocollini, broccoli rabe, Brussels sprouts,

<!-- chunk -->

### cauliflower, bok choy, Chinese cabbage, Chinese broccoli), green tea,

<!-- chunk -->

### watercress, dandelion greens, cilantro, artichokes, garlic, citrus peels,

<!-- chunk -->

### pomegranate, and even cocoa.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use hormone-balancing foods such as whole soy foods and ground

<!-- chunk -->

### flaxseeds.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use herbs such as turmeric, rosemary, and ginger, which are powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and detoxifiers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat garlic and onions, noted for their cholesterol blood-pressure-lowering

<!-- chunk -->

### and antioxidant effects. They are also anti-inflammatory and enhance

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drink green tea, which contains abundant amounts of anti-inflammatory,

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxifying, and antioxidant phytonutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### And yes . . . chocolate, only the darkest, most luxurious kind and only one

<!-- chunk -->

### to two ounces a day. It should be 70 percent cocoa.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sticking to these eating principles every day for six weeks will take

<!-- chunk -->

### you a long way toward building an UltraMind. However, if you want to be

<!-- chunk -->

### sure you follow the program, go to www.ultramind.com/guide and

<!-- chunk -->

### download the companion guide for this book, where you will find an easy-

<!-- chunk -->

### to-follow, six-week eating plan based on these guidelines. It’s an easy way

<!-- chunk -->

### to stick to the program, and a delicious way to heal your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now that you understand the basic underpinnings of the diet itself, next we

<!-- chunk -->

### need to discuss the supplementation you will need to create optimal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function. We will do that in the next chapter.


# TUNING UP YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY

# WITH SUPPLEMENTS


<!-- chunk -->

### Think of nutrients as fertilizer for your brain. Think of them as little helpers

<!-- chunk -->

### that improve communications and connections.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a perfect world, no one would need supplements. But given the stress of

<!-- chunk -->

### our modern life, the poor quality of our food supply, and the high load of toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### on our brains and bodies, we clearly need a basic daily supply of the raw

<!-- chunk -->

### materials for all our enzymes and biochemistry to run as designed.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part II we reviewed the research and the importance of nutrients for

<!-- chunk -->

### optimal brain function. If your doctor asks for evidence about the importance of

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional supplementation, have him read the scientific review “Vitamins,

<!-- chunk -->

### Minerals and Mood,”


<!-- chunk -->

### which summarizes only 126 of the best scientific papers

<!-- chunk -->

### and the rationale for using nutrients to support mood.

<!-- chunk -->

### That doesn’t even cover the data on autism, ADHD, or any of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases.

2;3

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, studying one nutrient alone as a drug to treat one disease will

<!-- chunk -->

### often fail. That is because nutrients work as a team.

<!-- chunk -->

### And there is a basic workhorse team needed for everyone. Additional

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements may help people with specific imbalances. You have identified

<!-- chunk -->

### these imbalances by taking the quizzes in Part II. I will show you how to

<!-- chunk -->

### incorporate these additional supplements in Part IV.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this chapter, I want to focus on the basic supplements everyone needs for

<!-- chunk -->

### good brain health. These supplements are an important part of the basic six-week

<!-- chunk -->

### plan. In chapter 19, where I give you a full outline of the program, I will show

<!-- chunk -->

### you how to incorporate them into your daily routine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are the basic raw materials needed for everyone who wants to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### their brain healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. A high-quality, high-potency, highly bioavailable broad spectrum

<!-- chunk -->

### multivitamin, which contains all the basic essential vitamins and minerals

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Calcium and magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA)

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Methylation factors: folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### . Often special activated forms of

<!-- chunk -->

### these nutrients are needed to be most effective for brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Probiotics or beneficial bacteria to improve your digestion, reduce food

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies, and reduce gut inflammation

# Not All Supplements Are Created Equal

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the last fifteen years researching and treating thousands of patients, I

<!-- chunk -->

### have learned much about how to find safe, high-quality, and effective nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement products.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finding the best products to support health has always been the most

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult part of my job, as it is for any practitioner of Functional Medicine. The

<!-- chunk -->

### lack of adequate government regulations, the dizzying number of products on the

<!-- chunk -->

### market, and the large variations in quality all create a minefield of obstacles for

<!-- chunk -->

### anyone trying to find the right supplement, vitamin, or herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be aware that all brands are not created equal. Quality is up to the

<!-- chunk -->

### manufacturer because of limited regulations regarding manufacturing. Certain

<!-- chunk -->

### companies are more careful about quality, sourcing of raw materials, consistency

<!-- chunk -->

### of dose from batch to batch, the use of active forms of nutrients, not using fillers,

<!-- chunk -->

### additives, colorings, etc.

<!-- chunk -->

### When choosing supplements it is important that you choose quality

<!-- chunk -->

### products. While I do not officially endorse or have any consulting or employee

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship with any supplement companies, I do believe a few have risen to the

<!-- chunk -->

### top of the supplement industry and can be safely used to help support and

<!-- chunk -->

### enhance your health. When choosing supplements, make sure to consider the

<!-- chunk -->

### following factors:

<!-- chunk -->

### Manufacturers who use GMP (good manufacturing practices) for drug or

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement standards from an outside certifying body

<!-- chunk -->

### Third-party analysis for independent verification of active ingredients and

<!-- chunk -->

### contaminants

<!-- chunk -->

### Products that have some basis in basic science, clinical trials, or have a

<!-- chunk -->

### long history of use and safety

<!-- chunk -->

### Use clean products, free of preservatives, fillers, binders, excipients, flow

<!-- chunk -->

### agents, shellacs, coloring agents, gluten, yeast, lactose, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### allergens.

<!-- chunk -->

### Each person must be cautious and evaluate companies and products for

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves. Be sure to pick quality supplements as you acquire the list of

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins outlined below. It is optimal to work with a trained dietitian, nutrionist,

<!-- chunk -->

### or nutrionally oriented physician or health-care practitioner to select the best

<!-- chunk -->

### products.

# Basic Nutritional Support for the Brain

<!-- chunk -->

## Ninety-two percent of Americans are deficient in one or more essential

<!-- chunk -->

## vitamins and minerals, 80 percent are deficient in vitamin D, and over

<!-- chunk -->

## percent are deficient in the essential omega-3 fatty acids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, I recommend that all people take a basic multivitamin and

<!-- chunk -->

### mineral, as well as calcium and magnesium, extra vitamin D, omega-3 fats, and

<!-- chunk -->

### probiotics as the foundation for good health, as well as a healthy brain. Because

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation is so important for the brain and nearly every other function of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, I recommend methylation nutrients (B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and folate) in addition to

<!-- chunk -->

### what is in your multivitamin as outlined below.

<!-- chunk -->

### These vitamins are to be taken daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a guide to get started on a comprehensive brain-supportive-

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement regimen:

<!-- chunk -->

## Multivitamin and Mineral

<!-- chunk -->

### A good multivitamin and mineral generally contains the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### Mixed carotenes (alpha, beta, cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein),

<!-- chunk -->

### 15,000 to 25,000 IU

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin A, 1,000–2,000 IU preformed retinol

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### , 400 IU to 800 IU

<!-- chunk -->

### Mixed tocopherols (vitamin E, including d-alpha, gamma, and delta),

<!-- chunk -->

### IU

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin C (as mixed buffered mineral ascorbates), 500 to 1,000 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin K


<!-- chunk -->

### , 30 mcg


<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine, 25 to 50 mg


<!-- chunk -->

### riboflavin, 25 to 50 mg


<!-- chunk -->

### niacin, 50 to 100 mg


<!-- chunk -->

### pyridoxine, 25 to 50 mg (ideally including pyridoxyl-5-phosphate)

<!-- chunk -->

### Folic acid (ideally as mixed folic acid and methylfolate), 800 mcg


<!-- chunk -->

### , 500 to 1,000 mcg (ideally as methylcobalamin)

<!-- chunk -->

### Biotin, 150 mcg to 1,000 mcg

<!-- chunk -->

### Pantothenic acid, 100 to 500 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Iodine, 25 to 75 mcg

<!-- chunk -->

### Zinc (as amino acid chelate), 10 to 30 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Selenium, 100 to 200 mcg (ideally as selenomethionine)

<!-- chunk -->

### Copper, 1 mg (should be avoided if you have autism or ADHD)

<!-- chunk -->

### Manganese, 5 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Chromium (ideally as chromium polynicotinate), 100 to 200 mcg

<!-- chunk -->

### Molybdenum, 25 to 75 mcg

<!-- chunk -->

### Potassium, 50 to 100 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Boron, 1 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Vanadium, 50 mcg

<!-- chunk -->

### Inositol, 25 to 50 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Choline, 100 to 200 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Iron (as chelate), 8 to 12 mg (only for menstruating women)

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep in mind that this usually requires the intake of two to six capsules or

<!-- chunk -->

### tablets a day to obtain adequate amounts. Some people may have unique needs

<!-- chunk -->

### for much higher doses that need to be prescribed by a trained nutritionist or

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine physician.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may not get exactly these amounts, forms, or ratios of ingredients in

<!-- chunk -->

### your multivitamin. Remember these are optimal guidelines and the exact forms

<!-- chunk -->

### and amounts of nutrients in a vitamin depend on the company that formulates it.

<!-- chunk -->

### So don’t be rigid. These are overall guidelines.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have problems swallowing supplements, you can try capsules instead

<!-- chunk -->

### of tablets. Or you can crush them, open them, and sprinkle them in food, or put

<!-- chunk -->

### them in shakes. There are also powdered and liquid forms of nutrients. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients can even be given as topical creams, such as magnesium or zinc.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is something for everyone, even infants and children.

<!-- chunk -->

## Balanced Absorbable Calcium and Magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to a multivitamin and mineral you will need to consider taking

<!-- chunk -->

### additional calcium and magnesium supplements. The amounts noted are the total

<!-- chunk -->

### daily requirements. What you will need depends on what is in your multivitamin.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your multivitamin contains 500 mg of calcium and 250 mg of magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### then you will need less from your calcium and magnesium supplement.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### Calcium citrate, 600 to 800 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### Magnesium amino acid chelate (aspartate, glycinate, ascorbate, taurate, or

<!-- chunk -->

### citrate), 400 to 600 mg

<!-- chunk -->

## Special Considerations for Calcium and Magnesium

<!-- chunk -->

### There are risks associated with too much calcium from supplements, so

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t go over the amount recommended. It is optimal to obtain most of

<!-- chunk -->

### your calcium (1,200 to 1,500 mg a day) from your diet (greens, sardines

<!-- chunk -->

### with bones, sesame seed tahini). You should limit your calcium

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements to no more than 600 to 800 mg a day. The amount often

<!-- chunk -->

### quoted by doctors of 1,500 mg a day is the total requirement, not that to

<!-- chunk -->

### be taken in supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some with severe magnesium deficiency may need more. Some may need

<!-- chunk -->

### less. If you are concerned you may be severely deficient, discuss the

<!-- chunk -->

### details with your doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diarrhea is often a sign that you are getting a little too much magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### If this occurs, just back off on the dose. This can also be avoided if you

<!-- chunk -->

### switch to magnesium glycinate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid magnesium carbonate, sulfate, gluconate, or oxide. They are poorly

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed (and the cheapest and most common forms found in

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements).

<!-- chunk -->

### People with kidney disease or severe heart disease should take

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium only under a doctor’s supervision.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

## 3

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D deficiency is epidemic, with up to 80 percent of modern humans

<!-- chunk -->

### being deficient or suboptimal in their intake and blood levels. Therefore, you

<!-- chunk -->

### should consider taking additional vitamin D to what is in your multivitamin.

<!-- chunk -->

### For maintenance I recommend:

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### , 2,000 IU (This is in addition to what is in your multivitamin,

<!-- chunk -->

### because so many people are significantly vitamin D–deficient.)

<!-- chunk -->

### However, there are many things to keep in mind as you take vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

## Special Considerations for Vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Take the right type of vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take only vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### in the active form (cholecalciferol). Look for this

<!-- chunk -->

### type.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many vitamins and prescriptions of vitamin D have vitamin D


<!-- chunk -->

### , which is

<!-- chunk -->

### not biologically active.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. For deficiencies you may need more vitamin D.

<!-- chunk -->

### For correcting deficiency you can safely take 5,000 to 10,000 IU a day for

<!-- chunk -->

### three months, but only under a doctor’s supervision. Some people may

<!-- chunk -->

### need higher doses than my daily recommendations over the long run to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain optimal levels because of genetic differences in vitamin D

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, living in northern latitudes, indoor living, or skin

<!-- chunk -->

### pigmentation.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Monitor your vitamin D status.

<!-- chunk -->

### Monitoring your vitamin D blood level (25 OH vitamin D) is necessary to

<!-- chunk -->

### be sure you are not on too little or too much. It should be part of every

<!-- chunk -->

### checkup with your doctor.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ideal range is 50 to 80 ng/ml.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are taking high doses (10,000 IU a day) your doctor must do a

<!-- chunk -->

### blood test to check your calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### levels every three months.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Give Time to Fill Up Your Tank

<!-- chunk -->

### It takes up to six to ten months to fill up the tank for vitamin D if you are

<!-- chunk -->

### deficient. As mentioned above, you may need 5,000 to 10,000 IU a day

<!-- chunk -->

### to get to this level. Don’t do this without your doctor’s supervision.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you are at optimal levels you can lower the dose to 2,000 IU a day

<!-- chunk -->

### for maintenance.

<!-- chunk -->

## Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplement

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend that everyone supplement his or her dietary intake of omega-3

<!-- chunk -->

### fatty acids. These brain-building essential nutrients are difficult to come by in

<!-- chunk -->

### our modern diet, and many of the good sources such as fish are contaminated

<!-- chunk -->

### with toxins. The data support the benefits for everyone young or old. Try the

<!-- chunk -->

### following:

<!-- chunk -->

### Fish oil, 1,000 mg twice a day containing a ratio of EPA/DHA 300/200,

<!-- chunk -->

### once in the morning and once in the evening. (This must be from a

<!-- chunk -->

### reputable company that certifies purity from heavy metals and

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Mighty Methylators and the B Complex Vitamins

<!-- chunk -->

### Among the most important ingredients for healthy mood and improved

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior, cognitive function, and memory are the nutrients needed for

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation. That is why I usually recommend additional methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation to those already in a multivitamin for people with brain


<!-- chunk -->

### These nutrients can be obtained in an additional high-quality B complex

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin or taken individually. Our B vitamins are quickly depleted from any type

<!-- chunk -->

### of stress. And all play one role or another in our brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### I generally recommend special active forms of folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### . I believe

<!-- chunk -->

### they are needed because of our genes, our lifestyle, medication use, and our

<!-- chunk -->

### unique biochemistry.

<!-- chunk -->

### For most, the following list of additional methylation vitamins will do just

<!-- chunk -->

### fine. The exact dose needed will vary from person to person, but these general

<!-- chunk -->

### guidelines apply to most.

<!-- chunk -->

### Folate (also referred to as folic acid), 800 mcg with at least 400 mcg

<!-- chunk -->

### coming from the active form or 5-MTHF (or L-methylfolate)


<!-- chunk -->

### or pyridoxine, 50 mg


<!-- chunk -->

### , 1,000 mcg with at least half coming in the form of methylcobalamin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Special Considerations for B Complex Vitamins

<!-- chunk -->

### Some people may need up to 250 mg of B


<!-- chunk -->

### or even a special “active” B


<!-- chunk -->

### called pyridoxyl-5-phosphate to be most effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Absorption of B


<!-- chunk -->

### can be impaired with aging, digestive disorders, and

<!-- chunk -->

### common medications (acid blockers), so occasionally B


<!-- chunk -->

### shots may be

<!-- chunk -->

### required.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sublingual or under-the-tongue forms of B


<!-- chunk -->

### may also be effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### These nutrients are often found together in special supplements for

<!-- chunk -->

### homocysteine or methylation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Probiotics

<!-- chunk -->

### These are essential, necessary ingredients for support of intestinal health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our poor-quality diet, overuse of medication, and stress all alter our normal,

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy intestinal flora or bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### I recommend at least a six-week course of probiotics to restore normal

<!-- chunk -->

### symbiosis (or ecological balance). That means using them the whole time you

<!-- chunk -->

### are on the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, these can be used for long-term health as well. In fact, I believe

<!-- chunk -->

### that given all the stresses on our guts, probiotics should be a part of our basic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation program for long-term health.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many different strains and varieties of probiotics. Some have

<!-- chunk -->

### extensive research behind them, others years of clinical experience. The key

<!-- chunk -->

### things to look for are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. What strains of organisms are there in the supplement you choose?

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. How many CFU or organisms per dose?

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Are they fresh?

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are my recommendations:

<!-- chunk -->

### 10 to 20 billion organisms taken on an empty stomach or with food twice

<!-- chunk -->

### a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.

<!-- chunk -->

## Special Considerations for Probiotics

<!-- chunk -->

### Preparations include freeze-dried bacteria packaged in powders, tablets,

<!-- chunk -->

### or capsule forms.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is important to take a combination product with multiple species of

<!-- chunk -->

### organisms.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are dairy-sensitive, seek out dairy-free brands.

# Special Guidelines for Taking Supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### When taking all of these supplements, there are a few things to keep in mind.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. The dosages outlined are the maximum total daily amount I recommend

<!-- chunk -->

### taking without a doctor’s supervision (with the exception of vitamin D).

<!-- chunk -->

### That means if you are getting B


<!-- chunk -->

### from several sources (your

<!-- chunk -->

### multivitamin and a separate B


<!-- chunk -->

### tablet), the total you should take every

<!-- chunk -->

### day from all sources is 1,000 mcg—no more.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Generally take all your vitamins with food—optimally with the meal or

<!-- chunk -->

### just before. People who take them after a meal may find they just sit on

<!-- chunk -->

### top of their food and upset their stomach. If you still have an upset

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach when taking your supplements, find a doctor who can help to

<!-- chunk -->

### correct any digestive problems, which are often the source of intolerance.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Take fish oil just before meals to prevent any fish taste from coming up,

<!-- chunk -->

### or freeze the capsules. If you swallow them frozen, they will be in your

<!-- chunk -->

### intestines before they dissolve.

<!-- chunk -->

### These supplements and the guidelines in this chapter are critical if you want

<!-- chunk -->

### to obtain optimal brain health and move toward an UltraMind. To make it as

<!-- chunk -->

### easy as possible to keep track of the supplements you are taking, I have included

<!-- chunk -->

### a “Supplement Checklist” in The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide. Please

<!-- chunk -->

### go to www.ultramind.com/guide and download the guide to acquire that

<!-- chunk -->

### checklist.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next part of the program we need to discuss are the lifestyle changes

<!-- chunk -->

### that are an important part of the UltraMind Solution.


# THE ULTRAMIND LIFESTYLE

<!-- chunk -->

## Exercise, Relax, Sleep, and Train Your Brain


<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the dietary changes and supplements you take on the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution, there are four basic lifestyle changes I recommend you

<!-- chunk -->

### integrate as well. These are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Exercise

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Improved sleep patterns

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Brain exercises

<!-- chunk -->

### Each of these has been scientifically proven to improve mood and all brain

<!-- chunk -->

### functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the checklists in chapter 19, I will outline when you should exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

### relax, and do your brain exercises.

<!-- chunk -->

### When you do, choose from the options in this chapter to integrate these

<!-- chunk -->

### changes into your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition, you should institute the sleep program I have outlined here

<!-- chunk -->

### every day for the rest of your life. Sleep is your body’s and brain’s time to

<!-- chunk -->

### rebuild cells and recharge. Without optimal sleep you will have a dull, anxious,

<!-- chunk -->

### unhealthy brain and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### While diet and supplementation are the heart of the program and the key to

<!-- chunk -->

### acquiring the nutrients you need for a healthy life, each one of these lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### changes is important as well. They are critical factors in obtaining an UltraMind.

# Exercise Is Better than Prozac: The Benefits of

# Exercise for Your Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### While most of us accept the benefits of exercise on our bodies, perhaps its

<!-- chunk -->

### most powerful effect is on our brains. It helps rewire our circuits and improve

<!-- chunk -->

### learning, memory, concentration, and focus. And it is the best anti-depressant

<!-- chunk -->

### and antianxiety therapy available.

<!-- chunk -->

### If it were in a pill it would be the biggest blockbuster drug of all time. Yet

<!-- chunk -->

### all you need to take advantage of it is a pair of shoes and not even that if you live

<!-- chunk -->

### near a beach.

<!-- chunk -->

## Exercise and Your Brain: The Benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is what exercise will do for your brain:

<!-- chunk -->

### Strengthens your cardiovascular system. Here the vascular part includes

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood vessels, which supply your brain. In fact, the most common

<!-- chunk -->

### source of cognitive decline as we age is not Alzheimer’s but hardening of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain arteries, called vascular dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Corrects and prevents insulin resistance. This is how to stop the major

<!-- chunk -->

### source of brain aging, which occurs through blood sugar and insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Erases the effects of stress and improves your resistance to stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improves mood and balances neurotransmitter function. It is better than

<!-- chunk -->

### Prozac for depression. It increases GABA (the antianxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter), serotonin (the happy neurotransmitter), and dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### (the energizing neurotransmitter), and helps keep all the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters in balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces inflammation and improves immune function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduces pain through increased endorphins, your body’s natural

<!-- chunk -->

### painkillers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Boosts overall motivation and the ability to be fully engaged in life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Increases neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. It improves existing

<!-- chunk -->

### connections, makes new ones, and helps stimulate the production of new

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### It does this through naturally increasing BDNF, or brain-derived

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotrophic factor. This is super fertilizer for the brain. It improves the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of neurons, helps them grow and sprout new connections, and

<!-- chunk -->

### protects them against cell death. It is the key link between thoughts,

<!-- chunk -->

### emotions, and movement.

<!-- chunk -->

### Balances hormones, including boosting testosterone and growth hormone,

<!-- chunk -->

### and balances swings related to estrogen and progesterone, which cause

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of PMS or menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prevents cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prevents dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

## What Do You Need to Do?

<!-- chunk -->

### Something.

<!-- chunk -->

## For the six-week program I ask you to commit to this: walk vigorously

<!-- chunk -->

## for thirty minutes every day. That is the only exercise you need to do for the

<!-- chunk -->

## UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### More is better. But anything is better than nothing, which is the habit of

<!-- chunk -->

### about half of Americans. About 40 percent never exercise, about 30 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise only sporadically and only 12 percent do regular vigorous exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### That means that 88 percent of Americans are not getting enough exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise is necessary for our brains to work properly. And the side effects

<!-- chunk -->

### are great—weight loss, increased energy, better sleep, and happier mood (not to

<!-- chunk -->

### mention better sex).

<!-- chunk -->

### I personally hate to exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### But I love to play.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t like going to the gym, there are many ways you can exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### without really “exercising.” You don’t have to go to the gym, run on a tread-mill,

<!-- chunk -->

### and pump iron to stay in shape. Just start moving around more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Go for walks with your friends or family. Go out and do some gardening.

<!-- chunk -->

### Play Frisbee in the park with your kids. Pick up a tennis racket and just knock a

<!-- chunk -->

### tennis ball around. You don’t even have to play a real match if you don’t want to.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anything you can do to get out and move your body can be considered

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise. So don’t think that you absolutely have to go to the gym to get fit. Just

<!-- chunk -->

### use your body more.

<!-- chunk -->

### A fun way to check in with how much you are exercising is to get a step

<!-- chunk -->

### counter. These devices are relatively inexpensive and they are a great way to get

<!-- chunk -->

### a sense for how much you move around every day. If you buy one, see if you can

<!-- chunk -->

### get up to ten thousand steps per day.(See Resources in The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Companion Guide for information on where you can purchase a step counter.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Whatever you do, just get moving!

<!-- chunk -->

### Keeping physically fit is essential for keeping mentally fit.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the six-week program I recommend you walk for thirty minutes a day

<!-- chunk -->

### every day. This is what you need to do to get your brain and body to start

<!-- chunk -->

### thriving again. That’s it. Just do that—thirty minutes of vigorous walking a day.

# SPECIAL NOTE

# GUIDELINES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EXERCISE PROGRAM

<!-- chunk -->

### In The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.ultramind.com/guide), I have provided a more comprehensive

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise program including further guidelines for aerobic conditioning, a

<!-- chunk -->

### special energy-boosting type of aerobic exercise called interval training,

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle building or strength training, and a stretching program.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the long term, building your exercise program around aerobic

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular fitness, stretching, and flexibility will provide the greatest

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits to your health and brain, but are not essential to the six-week

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution.

# Using the Mind-Body Effect with the Body-Mind

# Effect Maximizing Benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### Each of us must find a way to bring meaning, purpose, peace, and serenity

<!-- chunk -->

### into our lives in an active and deliberate way. Stress will find you. Don’t worry.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relaxation is more elusive...

<!-- chunk -->

### The odd paradox is that you must “actively” relax (and that doesn’t mean

<!-- chunk -->

### sitting on the sofa with a bowl of chips or ice cream watching TV). Remember

<!-- chunk -->

### the stress response is automatic and designed to protect us from danger. But deep

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation does not happen automatically. You have to work at it.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are hundreds of ways to turn on the relaxation response, and no one

<!-- chunk -->

### way is right or wrong. But to thrive, protect your brain, and heal the damage

<!-- chunk -->

### from a chronically activated stress response, you must find the antidote. Most of

<!-- chunk -->

### us don’t need any help finding our alarm button. That button gets pushed dozens

<!-- chunk -->

### of times a day. But we do need help finding the pause button.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are a few recommendations on how you can do that. You will find

<!-- chunk -->

### many more in The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide, which you can access

<!-- chunk -->

### by going to www.ultramind.com/guide.

<!-- chunk -->

## Finding the Pause Button

<!-- chunk -->

### Where is your pause button? Do you know how to find it? Most of us don’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is not something we ever learn.

<!-- chunk -->

### Healing, repair, renewal, and regeneration all occur in a state of relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### So how do we find the pause button and activate the parasympathetic nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system, otherwise known as the relaxation response?


<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Herbert Benson, of Harvard’s Institute for Mind Body Medicine, calls it

<!-- chunk -->

### “remembered wellness.” Studying Tibetan monks with decades of meditation

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, he found that their brains were different,


<!-- chunk -->

### and they could quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### slow down their physiology, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure, and

<!-- chunk -->

### produce calming brain waves.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is something ancient and familiar to all cultures—except ours. The

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation response or deep relaxation is activated with human connection,

<!-- chunk -->

### community, love, sex, prayer, celebration, music, dancing, chanting, and

<!-- chunk -->

### meditation,


<!-- chunk -->

### even laughter.

<!-- chunk -->

### The simplest is often the best.

<!-- chunk -->

## SoftBelly Breathing

<!-- chunk -->

### James Gordon, M.D., of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.cmbm.org), has used this simple and ancient technique to transform

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma and build connections in war-and disastertorn areas such as Kosovo, the

<!-- chunk -->

### Middle East, and New Orleans.


<!-- chunk -->

### It is called “soft belly.” You can do it anywhere,

<!-- chunk -->

### anytime.

<!-- chunk -->

### During the program try doing it five times a day. Do it when you wake up,

<!-- chunk -->

### before you go to bed, and when you sit down to each meal. Your life will

<!-- chunk -->

### change.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is how to do softbelly breathing:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Put your hand on your belly and allow your abdomen to relax.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Close your eyes or soften your focus, looking at the floor a few feet in

<!-- chunk -->

### front of you.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Breath deeply into your abdomen and feel it expand to the count of five.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Pause for a count of one.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Exhale slowly to a count of five, allowing your body to relax and release

<!-- chunk -->

### tension.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. Repeat for five breaths or until you feel relaxed.

<!-- chunk -->

## The UltraBath

<!-- chunk -->

### My next favorite way to push the pause button is the UltraBath. I like it

<!-- chunk -->

### because it is passive. Just fill a bath with hot water, two cups of Epsom salt, a

<!-- chunk -->

### half cup of baking soda, and ten drops of lavender oil. Then get in and soak for

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty minutes. If you want to enhance your experience, light a candle and put

<!-- chunk -->

### on some quiet rhythmic music. It is helpful for both relaxation and

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to do nothing more to push the pause button.

<!-- chunk -->

### But you can do more, if you choose to.

<!-- chunk -->

## Many Ways to Push the Pause Button

<!-- chunk -->

### Personally, I find I like variety, and I have found many ways to activate the

<!-- chunk -->

### pause button. My favorites are exercise, massage, yoga, saunas, journaling, deep

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing, and the UltraBath.

<!-- chunk -->

### We each may have a different route to achieving the same thing. The route

<!-- chunk -->

### we take may be spiritual, emotional, intellectual or physical, but all lead to the

<!-- chunk -->

### same results. Find the pause button and heal your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The key is to do something every day—even if it is just for five minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Profound, deep relaxation for thirty minutes a day will transform your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are more resources and suggestions for activating the pause button in

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide. Go to www.ultramind.com/guide

<!-- chunk -->

### and download the guide for more ideas.

# Sleep for a Sound Mind

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is one of those things we take for granted—until we can’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that everything that is good for your brain is good for

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep. Correcting imbalances in all the seven keys helps restore normal sleep. If

<!-- chunk -->

### your blood sugar swings up and down giving you night sweats, or your thyroid is

<!-- chunk -->

### out of balance, you have food allergies or are magnesiumdeficient, or you have

<!-- chunk -->

### mercury poisoning, you won’t be able to sleep well.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have sleep apnea you will need to see a specialist who can treat you,

<!-- chunk -->

### but for most other types of sleep disorders, getting to the roots of systemic

<!-- chunk -->

### balance will take care of the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to restoring balance in all your body’s core systems, there are

<!-- chunk -->

### many habits we engage in, including caffeine, alcohol, latenight Internet surfing,

<!-- chunk -->

### and TV in the bedroom, which impair our ability to get or stay asleep and alter

<!-- chunk -->

### our natural biological rhythms. They also negatively affect the quality of our

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### The other big obstacle to getting enough good quality sleep is your thoughts

<!-- chunk -->

### and emotions. Working with imagery and deep relaxation tools can be very

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting enough

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, try to change your relationship to sleep. Think of it as a sacred, precious,

<!-- chunk -->

### healing part of your day and prepare for it carefully.

<!-- chunk -->

## How to Get a Good Night’s Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### So what are we to do about our sleep problems?

<!-- chunk -->

### 1. For those who can sleep, getting more sleep (around seven to nine hours

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on the person) can have a dramatic benefit for your health and

<!-- chunk -->

### weight.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2. For those who snore or have sleep apnea, get tested and treated as soon

<!-- chunk -->

### as possible. Ask your doctor to order an overnight sleep study done in a

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep lab if this is a concern for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3. For those who have trouble sleeping, here are a few tips I use to help my

<!-- chunk -->

### patients get and stay asleep. This is what is often called practicing good

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep hygiene.

<!-- chunk -->

## Avoid Substances That Interfere with Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid substances that affect sleep, including caffeine, sugar, and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid medications that interfere with sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sedatives (these are used to treat insomnia, but ultimately lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### dependence and disruption of normal sleep rhythms and architecture)

<!-- chunk -->

### Antihistamines

<!-- chunk -->

### Stimulants (like Ritalin)

<!-- chunk -->

### Cold medication (pseudephedrine, phenylephrine)

<!-- chunk -->

### Steroids (prednisone)

<!-- chunk -->

### Headache medication containing caffeine (Floricet), etc.

<!-- chunk -->

## Get Back in Rhythm

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid any stimulating activities—such as watching TV, using the

<!-- chunk -->

### Internet, and answering e-mails—for two hours before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (and try to be in bed

<!-- chunk -->

### before 10 to 11 P.M.).

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise daily for thirty minutes before dinnertime.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t exercise vigorously after dinner (an evening walk is fine).

<!-- chunk -->

### Get regular exposure to daylight for at least twenty minutes, preferably

<!-- chunk -->

### first thing in the morning. The light from the sun enters our eyes and

<!-- chunk -->

### triggers our brain to release specific chemicals and hormones, like

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin, that are vital to healthy sleep, mood, and aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat no later than three hours before bed. Eating a heavy meal prior to bed

<!-- chunk -->

### will lead to a bad night’s sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## Create a Sleepy Environment

<!-- chunk -->

### Use the bed only for sleep and sex.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep your bedroom very dark or use eyeshades.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a noisy environment, block out sound by using earplugs (the

<!-- chunk -->

### soft silicone ones work the best).

<!-- chunk -->

### Make the room a comfortable temperature for sleep—not too hot or cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### Create an aesthetic environment helpful for sleeping by using serene and

<!-- chunk -->

### restful colors and eliminating clutter and distraction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Calm and Clear Your Mind

<!-- chunk -->

### Write your worries down. One hour before bed, write down the things

<!-- chunk -->

### that are causing you anxiety and make plans for what you might do the

<!-- chunk -->

### next day to reduce your worry. It will free up your mind and energy to

<!-- chunk -->

### move into deep and restful sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Get a guided imagery or relaxation CD to help you get to sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

## Relax Your Body

<!-- chunk -->

### Take an UltraBath. Raising your body temperature before bed helps to

<!-- chunk -->

### induce sleep. A hot bath relaxes your muscles and reduces tension

<!-- chunk -->

### physically and psychically. The UltraBath also gives you the benefits of

<!-- chunk -->

### magnesium absorbed through your skin, the alkaline balancing effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### the baking soda, and the cortisol-lowering effects of lavender, all of

<!-- chunk -->

### which help with sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Get a massage, stretch, or do a ten-minute yoga routine before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use a hot water bottle on your solar plexus (or snuggle next to a warm

<!-- chunk -->

### body). Warming your middle raises your core temperature. This helps

<!-- chunk -->

### trigger the proper chemistry for sleep. Either a hot water bottle, a heating

<!-- chunk -->

### pad, or a warm body can do the trick.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrients and Herbs for Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### Take an extra 200 to 400 mg of magnesium citrate or glycinate before bed

<!-- chunk -->

### in addition to what is on the basic supplement program. This relaxes the

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system and muscles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try 1 to 2 mg of melatonin thirty minutes before bedtime.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are still having trouble sleeping, make sure all of the keys outlined in

<!-- chunk -->

### Part IV are in balance.

# Exercises for Your Mind and Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s the point of having a healthy brain if you don’t use it to engage more

<!-- chunk -->

### fully in life? The joy of life is in all the things we humans get to experience—

<!-- chunk -->

### love, learning, discovery, connection, understanding, wisdom, and curiosity.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can eat well, exercise, learn to relax, and sleep well, all of which will

<!-- chunk -->

### nourish your brain. But then what do you do with it?

<!-- chunk -->

### Engage fully with your life. In work. In play. In love.

<!-- chunk -->

### But to do that you must keep your brain active. The mental decline we

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly see with aging is very much due to imbalance in nutrition, hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

### immune and digestive function, damage to our energy metabolism, toxins, and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### But some of it is also from lack of use. Just like your muscles—you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### use it or you lose it. Brain fitness is a real phenomenon. In a study of over

<!-- chunk -->

### adults over seventy-five years old it was shown that just reading books, doing

<!-- chunk -->

### crossword puzzles, playing cards and board games, playing a musical

<!-- chunk -->

### instrument, or dancing can all reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### So mental workouts also are needed. That is, doing something new,

<!-- chunk -->

### different, and challenging with your brain. You want to sprout new neural

<!-- chunk -->

### connections and wake up sleeping parts of your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In college, I learned two thousand Chinese characters, which I think helped

<!-- chunk -->

### me get through all the memorization of medical school. I started playing

<!-- chunk -->

### basketball at forty and tennis at forty-five. And I spend a lot of time trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the mysterious, complicated world of genes and molecules. You must

<!-- chunk -->

### find what works for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### What follows are some ideas that can get you started. I also recommend Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gary Small’s book The Memory Prescription, Dr. David Perlmutter’s The Better

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain Book, and The Healthy Brain Kit by Drs. Andrew Weil and Gary Small.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other helpful tools available for mental aerobics. The important

<!-- chunk -->

### thing is to keep your mind and brain engaged and active.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be creative—write in a journal, paint, make music, or dance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Seek out new ideas through attending lectures or local classes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try a new hobby.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do math in your head instead of on a calculator.

<!-- chunk -->

### Memorize all your friends’ phone numbers, and all your credit card

<!-- chunk -->

### numbers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Travel and explore new places.

<!-- chunk -->

### Play word games, do crossword puzzles or Sudoku.

<!-- chunk -->

### Join a study group, a book club, or start a “conversation” dinner club

<!-- chunk -->

### where you pick a topic and everyone has to engage and share.

<!-- chunk -->

### Practice mental aerobics (see Resources for more recommendations on

<!-- chunk -->

### products you can use).


# LIVING CLEAN AND GREEN


<!-- chunk -->

### Our brains are exquisitely sensitive to environmental toxins and stresses.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why I have included living clean and green as an essential part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are my suggestions for how to take care of your own health and the

<!-- chunk -->

### planet at the same time. There is an intimate connection between the

<!-- chunk -->

### sustainability of our own health and that of the planet. Small everyday choices

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to big changes over time for our communities, our planet, and ourselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Living clean and green involves four steps.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Drink clean water.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Limit your exposure to chemicals and metals.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Keep your body fluids moving.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Reduce your exposure to electropollution or electromagnetic radiation.

# Drink Clean Water

<!-- chunk -->

### You should drink a minimum of six to eight 8-ounce glasses of clean filtered

<!-- chunk -->

### water every day you are on the program (and every day for the rest of your life

<!-- chunk -->

### for that matter). One of the reasons drinking this much water every day is

<!-- chunk -->

### important has to do with detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxins are ultimately excreted through your stool and urine. When you

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t drink enough water, you become constipated, have darker urine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### urinate less frequently. These are signs that your detoxification system is not

<!-- chunk -->

### operating optimally and your health and mind will suffer as a consequence.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drinking water will also help you reduce withdrawal symptoms from

<!-- chunk -->

### addictive substances and food allergens you may experience on the program,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially during the preparation week. I will explain more about these

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms in chapter 18, where I discuss the preparation week.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately much of our water supply is contaminated with microbes,

<!-- chunk -->

### pesticides, plastics, metals, chlorine, fluoride


<!-- chunk -->

### (yes, fluoride), and other toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### So drinking water out of the tap is less than ideal.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best water to drink is water that has been passed through a filtering

<!-- chunk -->

### process. Common and inexpensive filters, such as carbon filters like the ones

<!-- chunk -->

### Brita makes, are available. See The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide for

<!-- chunk -->

### water-filter suggestions.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best filter is a reverse osmosis filter that puts the water through a

<!-- chunk -->

### multistep process to remove microbes, pesticides, metals, and other toxins. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can be installed under the sink. It’s a great filtering system (and it’s cheaper over

<!-- chunk -->

### the long run).

<!-- chunk -->

### Water in plastic bottles contains phthalates or bisphenol A, toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### petrochemicals. So avoid them if you can. Mineral water or still water in glass

<!-- chunk -->

### bottles is acceptable to drink.

# Limit Exposure to Chemicals and Metals

<!-- chunk -->

### While doing all the things in the following list is neither practical nor

<!-- chunk -->

### realistic, it is unfortunately what is optimal for our health. Incorporate the things

<!-- chunk -->

### you can. Find alternatives to the water you drink, get an air filter, or get rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### molds and other sources of indoor air pollution (the garden or household

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals you use, and artificial lighting).

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid water from plastic bottles, which contains phthalates. Drink water

<!-- chunk -->

### that comes in glass bottles or just filter your tap water as I explained

<!-- chunk -->

### above.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid excess exposure to environmental petrochemicals and toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### (garden chemicals, dry cleaning, car exhaust, secondhand smoke).

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid charbroiled foods that contain cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

### hydrocarbons.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid microwaved food, which produces more AGEs or advanced

<!-- chunk -->

### glycation end products in the food and creates more oxidative stress and


<!-- chunk -->

### Use HEPA/ULPA filters and ionizers to reduce dust, molds, volatile

<!-- chunk -->

### organic compounds (off-gassing from synthetic carpets, furniture, and

<!-- chunk -->

### paints), and other sources of indoor air pollution.

<!-- chunk -->

### Have house plants, which help detoxify the air.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduce heavy metal exposure by reducing intake or exposure to large

<!-- chunk -->

### predatory and river fish, water, lead paint, thimerosal-containing

<!-- chunk -->

### products, silver fillings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clean and monitor heating systems for release of carbon monoxide—the

<!-- chunk -->

### most common cause of death by poisoning in America.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reduce or eliminate the use of toxic household and personal care

<!-- chunk -->

### products (aluminum-containing underarm deodorants, antacids,

<!-- chunk -->

### petrochemical-/and toxin-containing creams and cosmetics, and pots and

<!-- chunk -->

### pans.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid or minimize exposure to bright and fluorescent lit areas. Use

<!-- chunk -->

### subdued full-spectrum/natural incandescent bulbs or candlelight as much

<!-- chunk -->

### as possible.

# Get Your Fluids Moving

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to exercise, which is a powerful natural detoxifier, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### include the following in your UltraMind program. Remember the only way

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins have to get out of your body is through urine, stool, and sweat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Facilitate excretory functions:

<!-- chunk -->

### Have one to two bowel movements a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drink six to eight glasses of water a day to have clear urine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sweat regularly and profusely with exercise and the use of exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

### steam baths, or saunas. You can also use the UltraBath (see page 317).

<!-- chunk -->

### Learn and practice deep breathing using the soft-belly technique (see page

<!-- chunk -->

### 317).

# Minimize Your EMR (Electromagnetic Radiation)

# Exposure

<!-- chunk -->

### We do not live in an ideal world. And it is impossible to eliminate exposure

<!-- chunk -->

### to electromagnetic radiation. Debate still rages. The research on harm from EMR

<!-- chunk -->

### is not as extensive as it should be. Yet the absence of evidence is not evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### absence.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just because we have not proved beyond a doubt that EMR is harmful,

<!-- chunk -->

### neither is there any evidence that it is safe. Until we have clear evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### safety I recommend erring on the side of caution, rather than waiting for forty

<!-- chunk -->

### years like we did with cigarettes before it was clear there was harm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are things you can do to minimize your risk from EMR. Do what you

<!-- chunk -->

### can.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try to minimize your exposure and usage of wireless communication

<!-- chunk -->

### devices, including cell phones, cordless phones, and WiFi devices.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turn your cell phone off when not in use and sleeping. Do not keep it

<!-- chunk -->

### near your head or use it to play games, movies, etc.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try to keep your cell phone at least six to seven inches away from your

<!-- chunk -->

### body while it is on, or when you are talking, texting, or downloading.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use air-tube headsets or speaker mode when talking. Wireless and wired

<!-- chunk -->

### headsets may still conduct radiation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do not keep your cell phone in your pocket or on your hip all day. The

<!-- chunk -->

### bone marrow in your hip produces 80 percent of the body’s red blood

<!-- chunk -->

### cells and is especially vulnerable to EMR damage. The proximity to your

<!-- chunk -->

### genitals may also affect fertility.

<!-- chunk -->

### Children and pregnant women should avoid talking on cell phones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Replace as many cordless and WiFi items as you can with wired, corded

<!-- chunk -->

### lines (phones, Internet, games, appliances, devices, etc.).

<!-- chunk -->

### Minimize or space out your computer use. Sit as far back from the screen

<!-- chunk -->

### as possible; flat screens are preferable. Use wired Internet connections,

<!-- chunk -->

### not WiFi—especially for laptops.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep a low-EMR sleep, home, and personal zone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Move your alarm clock radio at least three feet from your head or use

<!-- chunk -->

### battery-powered ones; six feet is the recommended distance from all

<!-- chunk -->

### electronic devices during sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid water beds, electric blankets, and metal frames, which attract

<!-- chunk -->

### electromagnetic frequencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Futons and wood-framed beds are better than metal-coiled mattresses and

<!-- chunk -->

### box springs.

<!-- chunk -->

### When using electric stoves, cook on back burners instead of front as

<!-- chunk -->

### much as possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metals attract EMR: keep them away from and off the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Measure EMR from wireless and wired devices with appropriate meters

<!-- chunk -->

### (see www.safewireless.org).

<!-- chunk -->

### To decrease exposures, consider installing EMR filters and preventive

<!-- chunk -->

### technologies to electrical circuits, devices, and appliances. These may

<!-- chunk -->

### help, although human studies are limited.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have now outlined the major principles of the UltraMind Solution. These

<!-- chunk -->

### revolve around diet, supplements, lifestyle changes, and living clean and green.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now it’s time start doing the program. In the next two chapters I will outline

<!-- chunk -->

### what to do for the preparation week and what to do every day you are on the six-

<!-- chunk -->

### week UltraMind Solution.


# THE PREPARATION WEEK

<!-- chunk -->

## Preparing Your Body and Mind for the Goodness to Come


<!-- chunk -->

### One week before you start the six-week program, prepare your body for all

<!-- chunk -->

### the goodness to come by shedding habits that interfere with your brain. By

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating items from your diet in a systematic way you will make your

<!-- chunk -->

### transition into the program simple and painless.

# Items to Eliminate

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the course of the next week you should eliminate these items from your

<!-- chunk -->

### diet entirely. Remember, in some cases they are hidden in places you may not

<!-- chunk -->

### expect. Be as vigilant as you can about reading labels and making sure the foods

<!-- chunk -->

### you eat do not contain the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### Caffeine —Cut your daily dose in half each day over the course of a week

<!-- chunk -->

### until you are off it. If you have four cups of coffee, go to two cups, then

<!-- chunk -->

### one cup, then one-half cup, then stop.

<!-- chunk -->

### Processed and refined carbohydrates and sugar —This includes all flour-

<!-- chunk -->

### based products (like bread and pasta) and all forms of sugar.

<!-- chunk -->

### High-fructose corn syrup —Go cold turkey and read EVERY label. High-

<!-- chunk -->

### fructose corn syrup is in places you don’t expect.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hydrogenated fats or trans fats —Found in baked goods, chips, fries, in

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, in almost every packaged food. Read labels for ingredients and look

<!-- chunk -->

### for the word “hydrogenated” even if it says zero trans fats, because if it

<!-- chunk -->

### has less than half a gram per serving the government allows the food

<!-- chunk -->

### industry to deceptively say “zero” trans fats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Processed and packaged foods —This means anything that comes in a

<!-- chunk -->

### box, bag, package, or can.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are concerned about reading labels correctly, go to www.ultra

<!-- chunk -->

### mind.com/guide and download the companion guide for this book where I have

<!-- chunk -->

### included a set of tips on what to look for on labels.

# Common Symptoms in the First Few Days

<!-- chunk -->

### The following symptoms are very common at the beginning of the

<!-- chunk -->

### preparation phase and may continue through the first few days of the six-week

<!-- chunk -->

### program as you eliminate gluten and dairy. Don’t worry, these symptoms are

<!-- chunk -->

### indicative that your body is eliminating toxins and are a good sign!

<!-- chunk -->

### Bad breath

<!-- chunk -->

### Constipation (If this is a problem for you, it should be addressed rather

<!-- chunk -->

### aggressively. I give a complete program for doing so in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide—www.ultramind.com/guide.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Achy, flulike feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### Fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### Hunger

<!-- chunk -->

### Irritability

<!-- chunk -->

### Itchy skin

<!-- chunk -->

### Nausea

<!-- chunk -->

### Offensive body odor

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep difficulties (too much or too little)

<!-- chunk -->

### These symptoms can occur for a number of reasons.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, eliminating food allergens like gluten and dairy often cause a

<!-- chunk -->

### withdrawal reaction, much like withdrawal from other addictive substances like

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, or heroin. We are often most addicted to the

<!-- chunk -->

### foods we are allergic to. This causes an allergy-addiction cycle. Getting off those

<!-- chunk -->

### allergens can cause a brief, flulike achy syndrome that may last one to three

<!-- chunk -->

### days.

<!-- chunk -->

### Second, toxins in our digestive tract may make us feel ill if we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate them. That is why it is important to address and prevent constipation if

<!-- chunk -->

### this is a problem for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### The last major cause of symptoms is caffeine withdrawal (which you will

<!-- chunk -->

### be dealing with in this preparation phase). This may cause a predictable

<!-- chunk -->

### headache, fatigue, and an achy feeling the afternoon after you give it up.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you experience any of these symptoms either during the preparation week

<!-- chunk -->

### or during the six-week program, I provide a specific set of recommendations that

<!-- chunk -->

### will ease your withdrawal symptoms, and make your transitions into the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution much easier.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, we don’t have the space to publish those recommendations

<!-- chunk -->

### here.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, I give all the details in The UltraMind Solution Companion

<!-- chunk -->

### Guide. If you suffer from withdrawal symptoms, or are concerned about this

<!-- chunk -->

### possibility before you begin, I strongly encourage you to go to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide and download the companion guide to this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s a big help on your road to an UltraMind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have completed your preparation week, it is time to begin the six-

<!-- chunk -->

### week program. In the next chapter I will explain how the program works and

<!-- chunk -->

### give you all the tools you need to make it as simple and enjoyable as possible.


# THE ULTRAMIND SOLUTION

<!-- chunk -->

## Boosting Your Brain Power for Life


<!-- chunk -->

### The six-week program is designed to remove all the processed, high-sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### foods from your diet as well as the two main allergens (gluten and dairy) that

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to your “broken brain” and replace them with an un-processed, real, natural,

<!-- chunk -->

### whole-foods diet. The foods you need to avoid are outlined in detail in chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### 14.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead of these toxic and inflammatory foods, you will eat the foods

<!-- chunk -->

### outlined in chapter 14 that are rich in healthy fats; slowly released, lowglycemic

<!-- chunk -->

### load, high-fiber carbohydrates; plant proteins; and minimal lean animal products;

<!-- chunk -->

### as well as disease-and weight-fighting anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, and

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant chemicals and phytonutrients. These foods give your body and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### the raw materials they need to heal and function optimally.

<!-- chunk -->

### No restriction is put on the amount of food you eat, because counting

<!-- chunk -->

### calories, carbs, or fat grams is not necessary. If you eat whole fresh foods, your

<!-- chunk -->

### body self-regulates. The emphasis is on cleansing, renewal, revitalization, and

<!-- chunk -->

### optimizing your body and your brain so they work as originally designed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the course of the diet pay attention to how your body and brain feel to

<!-- chunk -->

### find out what works for you. You may be more like the Greenland Inuit and feel

<!-- chunk -->

### satisfied with more healthful fats in your diet, or perhaps you are more like the

<!-- chunk -->

### Pima Indians and find that more fiber-rich carbohydrates work better for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same result can be obtained as long as you follow the basic nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### wisdom that is the foundation of The UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### By committing to this diet for six weeks, these principles will become

<!-- chunk -->

### second nature to you. The foods on this program will speak to your genes in new

<!-- chunk -->

### ways and your genes will say yes!

<!-- chunk -->

### Once your genes begin to say yes, you will be on your way to a lifetime of

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraWellness and the improvements you have experienced in your mind and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood will become permanent.

<!-- chunk -->

### After the six weeks are over, you can begin to reintroduce gluten and dairy

<!-- chunk -->

### if you choose to. I will teach you how to do that systematically so you find out if

<!-- chunk -->

### you are allergic to them (in the next chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

### But remember, it is only by eliminating gluten and dairy in the first place

<!-- chunk -->

### that you can tune back into your body and develop a realistic picture of how they

<!-- chunk -->

### have been affecting your health and your brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before you even begin the program I strongly encourage you to get the free

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution Companion Guide (download at

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide), where I have included a six-week eating program,

<!-- chunk -->

### shopping lists, foods to enjoy, and foods to avoid, as well as many delicious

<!-- chunk -->

### recipes and other resources to guide you through the program.

# Supplements and Lifestyle Changes During the

# UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the dietary changes you will experience during the UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution, taking the basic supplement regimen I outlined in chapter 15,

<!-- chunk -->

### exercising, relaxing, and doing brain exercises are all critical parts of the

<!-- chunk -->

### program.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the checklist at the end of this chapter I have outlined when you should

<!-- chunk -->

### integrate exercise, relaxation, and brain exercises into your day. I have also

<!-- chunk -->

### explained when to take your supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, you should at minimum walk for thirty minutes a day, every

<!-- chunk -->

### day, on the program. If you can manage it, it’s even better to do vigorous aerobic

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise four to five times a week (an interval training program where you

<!-- chunk -->

### regularly vary your heart rate is ideal). You can also include a strength-training

<!-- chunk -->

### regimen two to three times a week if you wish, but this is not absolutely

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary. See The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.ultramind.com/guide) for specific suggestions on how to exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should also practice active relaxation as I explained in chapter 16. I

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend you do the soft-belly breathing exercise immediately when you

<!-- chunk -->

### wake up, before each of your meals, and before you go to sleep. It’s a simple,

<!-- chunk -->

### quick way to initiate the relaxation response, so don’t forget it.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition, I recommend you try one more relaxation exercise of your

<!-- chunk -->

### choosing (my favorite is the UltraBath) in the evening before you go to bed. This

<!-- chunk -->

### is a wonderful way to end your day and sets the stage for excellent sleep at the

<!-- chunk -->

### same time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t underestimate the power of relaxation. Give yourself this gift for six

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks and watch how your life is transformed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally I suggest you engage in some of the brain exercises outlined in

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter 16 every day you are on the program if possible. If you can’t manage

<!-- chunk -->

### that, do a brain exercise of some kind two to three times a week. It’s fun, and it

<!-- chunk -->

### will work out your mind in new and interesting ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### In terms of daily supplements—they are daily, and you should take them

<!-- chunk -->

### every day for the rest of your life. I have given you reminders in the checklist at

<!-- chunk -->

### the end of the chapter as to when to take your supplements. However, you will

<!-- chunk -->

### find you remember naturally after a few days of doing it.

<!-- chunk -->

### In The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide I have provided a simple

<!-- chunk -->

### supplement chart to help you know what, when, and how to take your basic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements as well as any additional supplements you may need based on the

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in any of the keys which you will learn about in Part IV. Download

<!-- chunk -->

### the guide at www.ultramind.com/guide.

# Living Clean and Green During the UltraMind

# Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### I also encourage you to incorporate the recommendations for living clean

<!-- chunk -->

### and green in chapter 17 during the six-week program. Every one of us is affected

<!-- chunk -->

### by environmental toxins, and they impact brain and body health in serious ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### Give yourself a break from this toxic exposure. You may find it becomes a way

<!-- chunk -->

### of life for you—one that not only makes you healthier but heals our planet as

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

# The Daily Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### To make the UltraMind Solution simple, I recommend you stick to a

<!-- chunk -->

### ritualized daily schedule as much as you can. This means doing the same things

<!-- chunk -->

### (like waking up, eating, exercising, relaxing, and sleeping) at the same times

<!-- chunk -->

### every day. You don’t have to do this. But it makes the program easier and has

<!-- chunk -->

### several biological advantages like balancing your blood-sugar levels and

<!-- chunk -->

### reestablishing normal sleep rhythms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The schedule outlined in the checklist below is what I recommend you do

<!-- chunk -->

### every day on the program. Just follow the steps on the checklist every day, keep

<!-- chunk -->

### to the foods-to-eat and foods-to-avoid lists, and use the allergy-free brain food

<!-- chunk -->

### recipes found in The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide at

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide and you will automatically stay on the program. The

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMetabolism Cookbook also contains many gluten and dairy-free whole-

<!-- chunk -->

### foods recipes.

<!-- chunk -->

### You don’t have to do this perfectly. I know many people have schedules

<!-- chunk -->

### that vary quite a bit, and six weeks is a long time to do the same thing without

<!-- chunk -->

### interruption. Just stick to it the best you can and tune in to what your body is

<!-- chunk -->

### telling you about what works for you.

# Daily Checklist for the Six-Week Program

<!-- chunk -->

### Use the following checklist every day you are on the program. Make

<!-- chunk -->

### photocopies, and check off each item as you go through your day. You can also

<!-- chunk -->

### find this checklist in The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide. Go to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide, download the guide, and you can print out a copy.

# DAILY ACTION ITEMS

<!-- chunk -->

### Wake up ninety minutes before you need to leave the house.

# MORNING RITUAL

<!-- chunk -->

### Do soft-belly breathing upon waking.

<!-- chunk -->

### Engage in physical exercise, relaxation, or a brain exercise during

<!-- chunk -->

### this time (yoga is perfect in the morning).

<!-- chunk -->

### Drink one cup of decaf or caffeinated green tea that has been steeped

<!-- chunk -->

### in hot water for five minutes. (You may also have green tea later in the

<!-- chunk -->

### day. Limit your intake to two cups.)

# BREAKFAST (7 TO 9 A.M.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Take the first dose of your multivitamin, calcium/magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin D, omega-3 fats, and methylation supplements with your

<!-- chunk -->

### breakfast. (Other than the vitamin D, it is best to take your supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### in two daily doses.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Do soft-belly breathing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat breakfast.

<!-- chunk -->

### A few possible options are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Omega-3 eggs

<!-- chunk -->

### A protein shake

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten-free, whole-grain toast with nut butter and fruit

# MORNING SNACK (10 TO 11 A.M.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Eating snacks is an important way to stay in balance. Protein is

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly helpful. Possible snacks include:

<!-- chunk -->

### A handful of nuts (almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, or pecans),

<!-- chunk -->

### seeds (pumpkin seeds)

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh fruit

# LUNCH (12 TO 1 P.M.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Do soft-belly breathing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat lunch.

<!-- chunk -->

### While there are many lunch options, one option that I like is:

<!-- chunk -->

### Two cups of steamed or sautéed vegetables

<!-- chunk -->

### One-half cup of brown rice

<!-- chunk -->

### Sautéed fish—if you don’t have time to cook at lunch, canned salmon

<!-- chunk -->

### is also an excellent option (see Resources for clean sources).

# AFTERNOON SNACK (2 TO 3 P.M.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Any of the morning snack options are excellent, or, if you are really

<!-- chunk -->

### hungry, you could try another protein shake.

# BEFORE DINNER

<!-- chunk -->

### Walk for thirty minutes, or do your aerobic-exercise training. Do

<!-- chunk -->

### soft-belly breathing.

# DINNER (5 TO 7 P.M.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Take the second dose of your multivitamin, calcium/magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### omega-3 fats and methylation supplements with your dinner.

<!-- chunk -->

### (Remember, you do not need to take vitamin D again here.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat dinner—again, there are many possibilities here. However, one

<!-- chunk -->

### fast and delicious option is:

<!-- chunk -->

### Two cups steamed or sautéed vegetables

<!-- chunk -->

### Four to six ounces of baked or sautéed chicken (try seasoning with salt,

<!-- chunk -->

### pepper, lemon, and a little rosemary or thyme)

<!-- chunk -->

### One-half cup of brown rice or other whole grain

# BEDTIME OR EVENING RITUAL

<!-- chunk -->

### Twenty to thirty minutes of relaxation. I suggest an UltraBath. (It is

<!-- chunk -->

### not only relaxing, but helps you detoxify.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Do soft-belly breathing before falling asleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### *Caffeinated green tea has so many health benefits and so little

<!-- chunk -->

### caffeine that it is safe to drink on the program. You can also choose

<!-- chunk -->

### decaffeinated green tea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, you can find delicious recipes for all your meals and snacks,

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations on how to exercise, more tools for relaxation, a complete

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements checklist, and much more in The UltraMind Solution Companion

<!-- chunk -->

### Guide. Go to www.ultramind.com/guide and download the free guide to help

<!-- chunk -->

### you make the program as simple as possible.

# Summary of the Six-Week Program

<!-- chunk -->

### Before we move on, let me quickly summarize the principles of the six-week

<!-- chunk -->

### program for you. Remember, it revolves around a handful of simple principles.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Eat Healthy. The key to the whole program is eating a diet rich in healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### fats; slowly released, lowglycemic load, high-fiber carbohydrates; plant

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins; and minimal lean animal products; as well as disease-and

<!-- chunk -->

### weight-fighting anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, and antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals and phytonutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Take Supplements. The daily supplements outlined in chapter 15 are

<!-- chunk -->

### critical for optimal health, and everyone should take them every day to

<!-- chunk -->

### achieve an UltraMind.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Exercise. Its effects on your mind and body have been proven beyond the

<!-- chunk -->

### shadow of a doubt. Our bodies evolved at a time when we used them to

<!-- chunk -->

### survive. Enjoy your body and learn about the pleasures exercise can

<!-- chunk -->

### bring, mentally and physically.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Relax. Stress kills you. Relaxation correlates with long-term health. If

<!-- chunk -->

### you think you don’t have the time to relax, think again. You can’t afford

<!-- chunk -->

### not to. Your brain and body will thank you for it.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Live Green. Toxins are ruining your health and destroying our planet. We

<!-- chunk -->

### all need to make a concerted effort to live clean and green for ourselves,

<!-- chunk -->

### for future generations, and for the health of the earth.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Sleep. Get out of the habit of sleeping too little and then “supplementing”

<!-- chunk -->

### with coffee to keep going. Sleep restores and regenerates your body. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### the time your cells heal. Give your brain a chance to recuperate. It needs

<!-- chunk -->

### a rest and so do you.

<!-- chunk -->

### You now have all the tools you need to do the six-week UltraMind program.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the next chapter I will explain what to do when the six weeks are over.


# WHAT TO DO WHEN THE SIX WEEKS

# ARE OVER

<!-- chunk -->

## Achieve an UltraMind for Life


<!-- chunk -->

### Once you are finished with the six-week UltraMind Solution, I encourage

<!-- chunk -->

### you to transition out of it slowly to savor its full benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

### The temptation will be to splurge or reward yourself for your hard work,

<!-- chunk -->

### but resist that temptation. Overloading your system with foods that are bad for

<!-- chunk -->

### the health of your brain and body can often cause severe reactions.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, if you want to see for yourself the power of food to

<!-- chunk -->

### affect how you feel—indulge in all your old bad habits for one day and see just

<!-- chunk -->

### how bad you feel. That might be the best teacher for you, although take heed,

<!-- chunk -->

### you may not be able to function at all that day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take it slowly, and choose what you really want carefully. Think about

<!-- chunk -->

### what was just a bad habit. Your body has wisdom that will awaken during your

<!-- chunk -->

### experience on the program. Listen to the wisdom of your body when creating

<!-- chunk -->

### your life after it has ended. Go slowly and monitor your responses.

# What to Do When the Program Is Over

<!-- chunk -->

### When the six-week program is over you can (and should) continue many of

<!-- chunk -->

### the healthy habits you learned on it. At this point you have two options.

<!-- chunk -->

## Option 1: Continue the Program

<!-- chunk -->

### You may choose to stay off gluten and dairy for as long as you wish. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### you can keep following the program for a lifetime.

<!-- chunk -->

### If this way of eating and living feels right for your body and mind, then

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps it is the way you will choose to continue living. If so, you are already

<!-- chunk -->

### well on your way to UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within the parameters of the program there is almost infinite flexibility—

<!-- chunk -->

### Asian, Mediterranean, Indian, traditional Mexican, and Middle Eastern cooking

<!-- chunk -->

### are all options you can explore if you choose to.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learning how to eat real food is a discovery process. Because these foods

<!-- chunk -->

### have more fiber and nutrients, they are more filling and satisfying. Over time,

<!-- chunk -->

### you will learn to adjust portion sizes to your needs, and you will find foods that

<!-- chunk -->

### truly make your brain and body thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have reset your metabolism and you have established a pattern of

<!-- chunk -->

### eating and self-care that nourishes you, flexibility is important. Eating any food

<!-- chunk -->

### with great relish and delight—whether it is a decadent chocolate cake or the

<!-- chunk -->

### richest ice cream—is good for the soul and the senses.

<!-- chunk -->

### While some people may have trigger foods, like the first drink for an

<!-- chunk -->

### alcoholic, most of us can enjoy treats once in a while. Your body will tell you

<!-- chunk -->

### what feels good and what doesn’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have reestablished a relationship with your body and brain, you

<!-- chunk -->

### will be drawn to those foods that make you feel good, and from time to time that

<!-- chunk -->

### may include almost anything. Staying in balance and finding a rhythm are the

<!-- chunk -->

### keys to lifelong health and a healthy metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Moderation in all things is still great advice, and that includes moderation

<!-- chunk -->

### in moderation. Enjoy yourself. I wish you all endless health and happiness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Option 2: Reintegrate Dairy and Gluten

<!-- chunk -->

### If you choose, you may begin integrating dairy and gluten into your diet once

<!-- chunk -->

### the six weeks are over.

<!-- chunk -->

### Actually, it can be good to reintegrate dairy and gluten into your diet. This

<!-- chunk -->

### allows you to test it and find out whether or not it was contributing to your

<!-- chunk -->

### mood, behavior, attention, and memory problems, or other health issues such as

<!-- chunk -->

### headaches, joint pain, sinus problems, irritable bowel syndrome, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### weight gain.

<!-- chunk -->

### To reintegrate dairy and gluten into your diet, follow these guidelines.

<!-- chunk -->

## Reintroducing Gluten and Dairy When the Six Weeks Are Over

<!-- chunk -->

### At the end of the six-week program you may reintroduce gluten and dairy to

<!-- chunk -->

### see if they contribute to your brain problems. You need to be aware of what is

<!-- chunk -->

### going on in your body and mind as you do.

<!-- chunk -->

### You may not have been aware that gluten or dairy was triggering problems

<!-- chunk -->

### for you. When you eliminated it during the six weeks you may have

<!-- chunk -->

### unknowingly eliminated the very core of your psychiatric or neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. That means you need to be careful as you bring it back into your diet

<!-- chunk -->

### to find out whether or not it was truly the cause of your problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reintroducing gluten and dairy (and any other foods you are sensitive or

<!-- chunk -->

### allergic to) can trigger many symptoms, including:

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain fog

<!-- chunk -->

### Difficulty remembering things

<!-- chunk -->

### Mood problems (depression, anxiety, or anger)

<!-- chunk -->

### Nasal congestion

<!-- chunk -->

### Chest congestion

<!-- chunk -->

### Headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep problems

<!-- chunk -->

### Joint aches

<!-- chunk -->

### Muscle aches

<!-- chunk -->

### Pain

<!-- chunk -->

### Fatigue

<!-- chunk -->

### Changes in your skin (acne)

<!-- chunk -->

### Changes in digestion or bowel function

<!-- chunk -->

### When you reintroduce foods you are sensitive to (like gluten and dairy), eat

<!-- chunk -->

## them at least two to three times a day for three days to see if you notice a

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction (unless, of course, you notice a problem right away, then stop

<!-- chunk -->

### immediately). But be sure to leave three days between the time you introduce

<!-- chunk -->

### each food. For example, if you introduce gluten on Monday, don’t add dairy

<!-- chunk -->

### until Thursday.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms can occur from a few minutes to seventy-two hours later. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### have a reaction, note the food and eliminate it for ninety days. This will give

<!-- chunk -->

### your immune system a chance to cool off and your gut a chance to heal. In turn,

<!-- chunk -->

### this makes it more likely you will be able to tolerate more foods in the long run.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, you may find it best to eat them only occasionally (not more than once

<!-- chunk -->

### every three to four days) to keep the immune system cooled off.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you still react after eliminating the food from your diet for twelve weeks,

<!-- chunk -->

### you should stay off it for the long term, or see a physician, dietitian, or

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritionist skilled in managing food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keep a log of any symptoms that you experience when you reintroduce

<!-- chunk -->

### different food groups. Tracking your symptoms should guide you to which foods

<!-- chunk -->

### trigger allergic reactions in your system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Using a food log to track your symptoms and monitor your progress is an

<!-- chunk -->

### excellent way to identify what foods you can tolerate and what foods you are

<!-- chunk -->

### allergic to.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is not enough room here to print a sample; however, I have included

<!-- chunk -->

### one in The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide at www.ultramind.com/guide.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is a very detailed food log that you can use to track your symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keeping a food log helps create the connection between your daily food

<!-- chunk -->

### choices, activities, stress management, and how you feel. A journal will record

<!-- chunk -->

### your continuing sense of well-being, energy level, and weight loss. Having a

<!-- chunk -->

### written record is a more practical and accessible way to keep track of what is

<!-- chunk -->

### going on for you than simply trying to remember it.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can use this same system to reintegrate other foods not allowed on the

<!-- chunk -->

### program as well. However, always keep in mind the foods you should

<!-- chunk -->

### permanently avoid, and be wary of falling back into addictive patterns like

<!-- chunk -->

### eating sugar, flour products, or consuming too much caffeine (more than one cup

<!-- chunk -->

### a day) or alcohol (more than three drinks per week).

<!-- chunk -->

### While you may want to reintegrate some of these foods, there are other

<!-- chunk -->

### habits you learned on the program you will definitely want to adhere to from

<!-- chunk -->

### now on.

<!-- chunk -->

### The basic supplement plan is one of them. As I have said throughout this

<!-- chunk -->

### book, using the basic supplement plan I outline is critical for long-term health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise and relaxation is another. Exercise and stress reduction are among

<!-- chunk -->

### the few things that always correlate with long-term health in the scientific

<!-- chunk -->

### research. Don’t stop moving your body, and always take the time to relax. These

<!-- chunk -->

### are critical to finding UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## The single biggest gift you can give yourself at the end of this program is

<!-- chunk -->

## identifying which foods you are sensitive to, which were causing you brain

<!-- chunk -->

## problems, and which you can eat and enjoy safely.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why I focus on eliminating the two main foods that lead to mood

<!-- chunk -->

### problems and cognitive disorders and then reintegrate them systematically. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### the best way to find out which foods harm you and which help you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your fork is your key to a healthy body and mind. Listen to your body’s

<!-- chunk -->

### wisdom—sometimes it is smarter than your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now you have learned the basic maintenance program that will take care of

<!-- chunk -->

### 70 to 80 percent of problems with your mood, behavior, attention, cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### function, and memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you follow the basic plan as I have outlined here, you will discover

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement not only in mood, focus, and memory, but also in energy, weight,

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, and many other chronic health problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, some of us need a little extra help. We suffer from deeper

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances that require a little more fine-tuning. Since you have taken all the

<!-- chunk -->

### quizzes in Part II, you should know what areas you need to focus on.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part IV, I will guide you in going deeper. What supplements and other

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments are available that help correct these imbalances? This and more you

<!-- chunk -->

### will learn in Part IV. We are all unique and different. In the next part you will

<!-- chunk -->

### learn how to personalize the UltraMind Solution.

# PART IV

# Balancing the Seven Keys and

# Optimizing the Plan


# CREATING AN ULTRAMIND

<!-- chunk -->

## Balance the Seven Keys to UltraWellness and Optimize the Six-Week

<!-- chunk -->

## Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### My deepest wish for each of you is to find and work with a

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional/Integrative Medicine practitioner, someone who will help you fine-

<!-- chunk -->

### tune and personalize the UltraMind Solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, I know that is not possible, because there are not enough around.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am working with the Institute for Functional Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.functionalmedicine.org) to create curriculums for medical schools,

<!-- chunk -->

### residencies, and certification programs to train more doctors in practice. In ten to

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty years, I believe, all physicians will be trained in and practice the

<!-- chunk -->

### principles of Functional Medicine, because it is the medicine of the future.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fortunately, for 80 percent of you it may not be necessary to work with a

<!-- chunk -->

### physician or Functional Medicine practitioner if you follow the six-week plan

<!-- chunk -->

### for an UltraMind.

<!-- chunk -->

### I also believe that, by using the quizzes in Part II to identify which keys are

<!-- chunk -->

### out of balance, you can customize the UltraMind Solution for yourself by adding

<!-- chunk -->

### the suggestions I will provide in the chapters that follow.

<!-- chunk -->

### The quizzes in Part II offer three options to fix your broken brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### optimize your health. These are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Follow the basic six-week plan for an UltraMind in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Self-Care

<!-- chunk -->

### Add the recommendations for specific foods, lifestyle suggestions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements in the chapters that follow to optimize the keys that are out

<!-- chunk -->

### of balance for you.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Medical Care

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a severe imbalance in any of the keys I advise you to seek the

<!-- chunk -->

### assistance of a practitioner of Functional or Integrative Medicine. In

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to the suggestions for optimizing the keys, I will give you

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations for tests or treatments you should discuss with your

<!-- chunk -->

### physician in the chapters that follow.

<!-- chunk -->

### In each quiz your score will put you in one of the three groups:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. If your score qualifies you for the UltraMind Solution, simply follow the

<!-- chunk -->

### basic plan in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. If your score qualifies you for Self-Care, then integrate the additional

<!-- chunk -->

### suggestions here in Part IV into your six-week plan.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. If your score qualifies you for Medical Care, follow the UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution with the additional recommendations for Self-Care for six

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks. Then retake the quizzes. Many of you will then no longer qualify

<!-- chunk -->

### for Medical Care. If you still do, then seek out a practitioner of

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional or Integrative Medicine to request the necessary tests and

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have kept to a few suggestions in each key that I have found to be the

<!-- chunk -->

### most effective and important interventions to optimize your body’s core systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are, of course, many other options that are available to normalize function

<!-- chunk -->

### in each key; however, they are best applied with an experienced practitioner.

# Personalizing the UltraMind Solution: Self-Care and

# Medical Care

<!-- chunk -->

### Each of us is unique, genetically, developmentally, environmentally,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychologically, and spiritually. Each of us has areas of weakness and strength.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finding those and adapting your health practices and treatment to that

<!-- chunk -->

### uniqueness is essential if you are to regain full health and vitality.

<!-- chunk -->

### The practice of Functional Medicine, the art of creating UltraWellness for

<!-- chunk -->

### my patients, is so very different from the process I learned in medical school. Yet

<!-- chunk -->

### it is a much better map for the territory of illness. And ultimately it is quite

<!-- chunk -->

### simple. It involves two simple principles:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Get rid of the bad stuff.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Add the good stuff.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s it.

<!-- chunk -->

### The amazing healing powers of the body for regeneration and repair show

<!-- chunk -->

### up if we simply find what’s not agreeing with you and remove it, and then

<!-- chunk -->

### provide the missing ingredients your body needs to thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the process I have done thousands of times with my patients and I

<!-- chunk -->

### have had extraordinary success.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this part of the book, I will use these same principles to guide you toward

<!-- chunk -->

### optimizing key areas that may be out of balance for you. I will also explain how

<!-- chunk -->

### you can integrate these steps into the six-week plan outlined in Part III, so you

<!-- chunk -->

### can take full advantage of the UltraMind Solution. There are a few simple steps

<!-- chunk -->

### to follow.

<!-- chunk -->

### For all the seven keys to UltraWellness that help you create an UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### there is a short list of things that create imbalances and a short list of things that

<!-- chunk -->

### are needed to create optimal function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is the list of the bad stuff and the good stuff. It’s not a long list really,

<!-- chunk -->

### and it is enough to address nearly any medical problem. This is the different

<!-- chunk -->

### map. And it will get you to where you want to go—optimal, vigorous, resilient,

<!-- chunk -->

### and robust health—or, more simply, the state of UltraWellness.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Bad Stuff

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the things in your diet, lifestyle, and environment that are sending

<!-- chunk -->

### your body out of balance. These five factors are, in fact, the cause of all disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Poor diet (nutrient poor, calorie dense)

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Stress (physical or psychological)

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Toxins (chemicals, metals, biological, and internal metabolic toxins)

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Allergens (foods, molds, dust, pollens, and chemicals)

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Microbes or bugs (bacteria, yeast, parasites, viruses, prions, etc.)

<!-- chunk -->

## The Good Stuff

<!-- chunk -->

### This is what you need to add to your diet, lifestyle, and environment to

<!-- chunk -->

### rebalance your systems.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. High-quality food (proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fiber, phytonutrients)

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Vitamins, minerals, and conditionally essential nutrients (and

<!-- chunk -->

### occasionally bioidentical hormones)

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Water, air, and light

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Exercise/movement

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Deep relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. Rhythm

<!-- chunk -->

## 8. Love, community, connection, meaning, and purpose

<!-- chunk -->

### Much of this is incorporated into the basic six-week UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### outlined in Part III. In fact, it is remarkable that by simply eating whole fresh

<!-- chunk -->

### foods, taking a few essential supplements, and getting some exercise, restful

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, and deep relaxation, the core systems of the body can reset, recover,

<!-- chunk -->

### repair, and heal.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the six-week plan, most of the bad stuff is removed and nearly all of the

<!-- chunk -->

### good stuff is recommended. The body’s wisdom then rebalances your whole

<!-- chunk -->

### system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Occasionally, a few additional steps are necessary to correct more serious

<!-- chunk -->

### problems such as intestinal infections or heavy metal poisoning. But up to

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of your problems may be taken care of by the basic six-week UltraMind


<!-- chunk -->

### In some cases, when key systems are really out of balance, it’s necessary to

<!-- chunk -->

### add these few additional steps. That is what I am going to teach you to do here.

<!-- chunk -->

### In each chapter you will find:

<!-- chunk -->

## The Self-Care Plan

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Foods —A list of additional foods you should focus on integrating into

<!-- chunk -->

### your diet to help optimize each key (I have included this only in cases

<!-- chunk -->

### where there are specific foods you should incorporate in addition to what

<!-- chunk -->

### is on the six-week program).

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Supplements —Supplements you can add to help you optimize each key.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: If you are out of balance in several keys, it may seem like there are

<!-- chunk -->

### a lot of supplements to take. However, it isn’t as overwhelming as it

<!-- chunk -->

### seems. I have created a special checklist for supplements that makes it

<!-- chunk -->

### very easy to understand what to take. It is in The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Companion Guide at www.ultramind.com/guide.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.Lifestyle Changes —Lifestyle changes that may assist you in key

<!-- chunk -->

### optimization.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Medical Care Plan

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Doctor Actions —A list of action items you can take with your doctor’s

<!-- chunk -->

### assistance.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Doctor Guidelines —Guidelines on specific treatments that your doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### may use, such as hormones or metal detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### Go back to your quiz scores and identify which keys you need to work

<!-- chunk -->

### through. Then simply follow the Self-Care or the Medical Care plans, depending

<!-- chunk -->

### on how you scored.

<!-- chunk -->

### (You can find printable copies of all the quizzes in The UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### Companion Guide. Go to www.ultramind.com/guide for more information.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people will score high in several key areas. This is because your body

<!-- chunk -->

### is one ecosystem—when one system goes out of balance it can send the others

<!-- chunk -->

### out of balance as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you score high in several keys, start the six-week program and integrate

<!-- chunk -->

### steps to optimize each key in the following order:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Fix your digestion—it’s amazing how many problems can be resolved by

<!-- chunk -->

### fixing your gut. Start here and you may witness miraculous changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### your health.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Cool off inflammation—this key is intimately related to the gut and the

<!-- chunk -->

### next natural step to take.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Optimize nutrition.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Enhance detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Balance your hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Boost energy metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. Calm your mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wait three days to begin working on a new key. For example, if you scored

<!-- chunk -->

### high on the “Fatty Acids” quiz, the “Insulin” quiz, and the “Gut” quiz, you

<!-- chunk -->

### would start the six-week program and begin working in the steps in chapter 25 to

<!-- chunk -->

### fix your digestion. After three days, you could begin integrating the steps in

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter 22 to enhance your phospholipids. Then, after three more days, you

<!-- chunk -->

### could begin integrating the steps in chapter 23 to improve your insulin balance.

# A SPECIAL NOTE ON MEDICAL CARE AND TESTING

<!-- chunk -->

### Up to 80 percent of people will recover and thrive by following the six-

<!-- chunk -->

### week UltraMind Solution in Part III with a few additional steps for Self-

<!-- chunk -->

### Care in Part IV. However, the other 20 percent will need further care.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you don’t get significantly better following the UltraMind Solution

<!-- chunk -->

### and the Self-Care plan in this section, then you may need some laboratory

<!-- chunk -->

### tests and further medical treatment. I have outlined this in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide (www.ultramind.com/guide). To do those tests

<!-- chunk -->

### and get the treatment you need, you will need to find an experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### practitioner of Functional or Integrative Medicine. I will offer some

<!-- chunk -->

## options in the Resources, or you can visit our team at The UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

## Center in Lenox, Massachusetts (www.ultrawellnesscenter.com).

<!-- chunk -->

### Most tests I recommend in my practice are available through

<!-- chunk -->

### conventional large commercial labs such as Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others are small, specialty labs that specialize in metabolic, immune,

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritional, or functional testing.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is still great controversy in conventional medical circles about the

<!-- chunk -->

### utility of these laboratory tests, but I have used them successfully for over

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty years in treating patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have used these tests on thousands of patients to help me navigate this

<!-- chunk -->

### new medical territory with great success. They are often imperfect and may

<!-- chunk -->

### not always give clear yes or no answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rather, many of these tests identify disturbances in function, not

<!-- chunk -->

### pathology. In other words, you may not have anemia from lack of folate,

<!-- chunk -->

### but you might have any number of important pathways that are jammed

<!-- chunk -->

### because you don’t have enough folate for you—leading to depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, autism, or ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tests I recommend can often help me identify patterns and guide me

<!-- chunk -->

### in choosing the best therapies to help my patients regain balance. I think

<!-- chunk -->

### they can help you and your doctor the same way.

<!-- chunk -->

### While testing isn’t always necessary, it can be very helpful in honing in

<!-- chunk -->

### on specific imbalances in your biochemistry that are creating problems for

<!-- chunk -->

### you.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the guide I explain exactly which tests to use to identify deeper

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances in each of the seven keys. They will help you work with your

<!-- chunk -->

### physician to find the cause of your problems.

# Practicing Self-Care

<!-- chunk -->

### I believe in self-care. Take back your health from the medical system. Leave

<!-- chunk -->

### your diseases to the “disease care” system. Most health problems can be

<!-- chunk -->

### addressed without the help of a trained health professional. If you work on

<!-- chunk -->

### taking out the bad stuff and putting in the good stuff, 80 percent of problems will

<!-- chunk -->

### heal.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the other 20 percent you need the help of a trained professional in

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional or Integrative Medicine, or a conventional medical specialist,

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### Part IV of the UltraMind Solution is designed to help you regain control of

<!-- chunk -->

### your health and your health care. I know I can help you achieve that goal.


# KEY #1: OPTIMIZE NUTRITION


<!-- chunk -->

### Hippocrates said thousands of years ago that doctors should “leave their

<!-- chunk -->

### potions in the chemist’s crucible if they heal their patients with food.” Because

<!-- chunk -->

### of our widespread nutrient deficiencies, I would add “. . . heal their patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### food and nutrients.”

<!-- chunk -->

### By far, the most powerful tool I have to help my patients heal—more

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful than any medication—is food (and nutritional therapy).

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember . . .

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. You must all have essential fats—DHA, EPA, and PC and PS for your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and every one of your 100 trillion cells to function well.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Amino acids are the building blocks of moods, thought, and memory—

<!-- chunk -->

### get them tuned up.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Keep the methylation and sulfation trains running with the right types

<!-- chunk -->

### and amounts of folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and betaine, and sources of sulfur in the

<!-- chunk -->

### diet and supplements (see chapter 6).

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Most of us are vitamin D–deficient. Getting enough on board will help

<!-- chunk -->

### your brain and prevent many diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Magnesium is the major relaxation mineral.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Zinc and selenium are absolutely critical for a happy, healthy brain and


<!-- chunk -->

### Using the basic program, you can take care of most of your needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, in some cases people need additional support, especially with

<!-- chunk -->

### phospholipids and neurotransmitters.


<!-- chunk -->

### The Self-Care plan for nutrition is quite simple. It involves just a few

<!-- chunk -->

### additional suggestions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplementation for Phospholipid Membrane Support

<!-- chunk -->

### If you scored over 5 on the “Fatty Acids” quiz on page 85, increase your in-

<!-- chunk -->

### take of phospholipids by taking the following:

<!-- chunk -->

### PS (phosphatidylserine), 200 mg twice a day with meals for two months,

<!-- chunk -->

### after two months reduce to 100 mg twice a day with meals.

<!-- chunk -->

### GPC (glycerophosphocholine) or CDP-choline, 1,200 mg three times a

<!-- chunk -->

### day with meals for two months, after two months reduce to 400 mg three

<!-- chunk -->

### times a day with meals

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplementation with Amino Acids to Optimize

<!-- chunk -->

## Neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember that all of your neurotransmitters are built out of amino acids, the

<!-- chunk -->

### building blocks of protein. Eating protein with each meal helps supply adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acids for you to make all your neurotransmitters. Supplementing these

<!-- chunk -->

### amino acids can, in many cases, help you overcome the neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiencies that may be leading to your mood problems and brain dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### You should start by supporting one neurotransmitter at a time. Start with the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter you scored highest on in the quizzes.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, if you scored highest on the serotonin deficiency quiz, start

<!-- chunk -->

### with serotonin support. You can slowly add support for each additional

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter if your symptoms persist. Try the support for one

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter for one week, and then add support for the next one the

<!-- chunk -->

### following week (while continuing your previous regimen) until you have

<!-- chunk -->

### achieved the balance you desire.

# SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR AMINO-ACID THERAPY

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Since many neurotransmitters are often out of balance, multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements are often necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Start with one neurotransmitter support program at a time. Give each

<!-- chunk -->

### new neurotransmitter support program one week to work before adding

<!-- chunk -->

### the next.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. It is best to start with the inhibitory neurotransmitter support (serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### and GABA) and then after a week or two move to the excitatory support

<!-- chunk -->

### (dopamine and acetylcholine).

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Amino-acid therapy can usually safely be used with psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### medication with one exception—monoamine oxidase inhibitors

<!-- chunk -->

### (Parnate, Nardil, Marplan). However, combining medication with

<!-- chunk -->

### amino-acid therapy should be done with the supervision of a physician

<!-- chunk -->

### who understands amino acids and psychotropic medications.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Using amino acids helps prevent the depletion of neurotransmitters and

<!-- chunk -->

### can often help people wean off medications.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Amino-acid therapy often works quickly and you may notice effects

<!-- chunk -->

### within days to weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

## 7. You should continue the therapy for a total of six months before slowly

<!-- chunk -->

### weaning yourself off the amino acids. You may not need them after that.

<!-- chunk -->

## Serotonin Support

<!-- chunk -->

### You can either take 5-HTP or tryptophan to support your serotonin level.

<!-- chunk -->

### Try:

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan), 50 mg twice a day, once in the afternoon

<!-- chunk -->

### and once before bed. Add an additional 50 mg in the afternoon and at

<!-- chunk -->

### bedtime every three days until you get to a maximum dose of 150 mg

<!-- chunk -->

### once in the afternoon and once before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or,

<!-- chunk -->

### Take tryptophan, 500 mg once in the afternoon and once before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take these on an empty stomach (one hour before or two hours after

<!-- chunk -->

### meals).

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, use either 5-HTP or tryptophan, not both. If you are taking an

<!-- chunk -->

### SSRI or antidepressant, check with your health-care provider before taking 5-

<!-- chunk -->

### HTP or tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### To help you sleep, you can also try:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1 to 3 mg of melatonin before bed to help with sleep if needed.

<!-- chunk -->

## GABA Support

<!-- chunk -->

### Take GABA, 500 mg once mid-afternoon and once before bed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take theanine, 200 mg once in the morning and once before bed. (This is

<!-- chunk -->

### the amino acid from green tea.)

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA and Theanine complement each other.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dopamine Support

<!-- chunk -->

### Take L-tyrosine, 500 mg once before breakfast, once mid-morning, and

<!-- chunk -->

### once mid-afternoon. After three days increase to 1,000 mg before

<!-- chunk -->

### breakfast, mid-morning, and mid-afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### After one week add I-phenylalanine, 500 mg once before breakfast, once

<!-- chunk -->

### mid-morning, and once mid-afternoon. After three days increase to 1,000

<!-- chunk -->

### mg before breakfast, mid-morning, and mid-afternoon.

<!-- chunk -->

### These should be taken on an empty stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

## Acetylcholine Support

<!-- chunk -->

### See page 353 for GPC support. Acetylcholine is made from choline; you

<!-- chunk -->

### should get a sufficient amount with the supplementation

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations above.


<!-- chunk -->

### Testing for amino acids and neurotransmitters can help identify your

<!-- chunk -->

### particular imbalances more accurately.

<!-- chunk -->

### Further customization of amino-acid therapy is possible based on testing

<!-- chunk -->

### and your symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Testing for omega-3 fats, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, and selenium can

<!-- chunk -->

### be helpful in identifying the need for additional supplementation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Testing for methylation problems with homocysteine and methylmalonic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid is often very helpful in optimizing doses of folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### Occasionally medication may be necessary as a short-term treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### while you are balancing the seven keys to UltraWellness.


# KEY #2: BALANCE YOUR HORMONES


<!-- chunk -->

### Balance is the key to staying healthy, and nowhere is this truer than in the

<!-- chunk -->

### world of hormones. It is important not to think of them separately but as

<!-- chunk -->

### interconnected parts of a whole that all affect each other.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones are influenced by imbalances in all the seven keys. Our body is

<!-- chunk -->

### one whole system where everything is linked to everything else. So improving

<!-- chunk -->

### your nutrition, or reducing inflammation, fixing your gut, and getting rid of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins all support normalization of hormone function, which translates into

<!-- chunk -->

### better mood, more focus, and better brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### The quizzes in Part II may have alerted you to focus on imbalances that

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to problems with insulin, your thyroid, or sex hormones. Balancing your

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones is relatively easy. Follow these guidelines.

# Optimizing Insulin Balance: Self-Care Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### The key to insulin balance is eating the diet in the six-week program.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if you scored over 9 on the “Insulin” quiz, you may also need to

<!-- chunk -->

### integrate the following supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplementation for Insulin Resistance

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many blood-sugar balancing nutrients often found in combinations.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to what you will get in your basic supplement plan, these

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients can be used to help balance blood sugar and insulin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chromium, 500 mcg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### Glucomannan fiber, polyglycoplex (PGX), or konjac root, four capsules

<!-- chunk -->

### five to ten minutes before meals with a glass of water (Note: This is one

<!-- chunk -->

### of the most powerful treatments for insulin problems and weight.)

# OPTIMIZING INSULIN BALANCE: MEDICAL CARE PLAN

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Additional testing may be necessary, including:

<!-- chunk -->

## a. A two-hour glucose-tolerance test measuring both insulin and glucose.

<!-- chunk -->

## b. Cholesterol profile measuring the size of cholesterol particles, which are

<!-- chunk -->

### smaller in insulin resistance and more prone to clog your arteries.

<!-- chunk -->

## c. C-reactive protein, which measures inflammation that is associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

## d. Liver function tests with GGT that identify the fatty liver associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with insulin resistance.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Additional supplements that are often helpful include alpha lipoic acid,

<!-- chunk -->

### biotin, vanadium, N-acetylcysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Herbs may also be helpful, including extracts of hops, acacia bark,

<!-- chunk -->

### ginseng, green tea, fenugreek, cinnamon, gymnena sylvestre, bitter

<!-- chunk -->

### melon, and garlic.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Medications such as glucophage (metformin) or Actos are occasionally

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful as a bridge in balancing your blood sugar.

# Support Your Thyroid: Self-Care Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### The production of thyroid hormones requires iodine and omega-3 fatty acids;

<!-- chunk -->

### converting the inactive T4 to the active T3 requires selenium, the binding of T3

<!-- chunk -->

### to the receptor on the nucleus, and switching it on requires vitamins A, D, and

<!-- chunk -->

### zinc. All of these elements are found in a good whole foods diet and your basic

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, there are a few food items you should concentrate on integrating

<!-- chunk -->

### into the program to support your thyroid.

<!-- chunk -->

## Foods for Thyroid Support

<!-- chunk -->

### These foods are particularly good for thyroid problems:

<!-- chunk -->

### Seaweed or sea vegetables have iodine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fish has iodine, omega-3 fats, and vitamin D (especially sardines and

<!-- chunk -->

### wild salmon).

<!-- chunk -->

### Dandelion greens have vitamin A.

<!-- chunk -->

### Smelt, herring, scallops, and Brazil nuts have selenium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Also make sure you eliminate the cause of thyroid problems. The following

<!-- chunk -->

### may be contributing to your problems:

<!-- chunk -->

### Soy foods and the broccoli family (broccoli, cabbage, kale, Brussels

<!-- chunk -->

### sprouts, collard greens) have all been said to cause thyroid dysfunction,

<!-- chunk -->

### but they also have many other health benefits. Human studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### shown no significant effect when whole traditional soy (tofu, tempeh,

<!-- chunk -->

### miso, edamame) is consumed in normal quantities.


<!-- chunk -->

### I don’t recommend

<!-- chunk -->

### avoiding any of these foods, because the benefits are so great and the

<!-- chunk -->

### potential risk is questionable or negligible. However I would avoid all

<!-- chunk -->

### processed soy foods such as burgers, cheese, and bars—these have

<!-- chunk -->

### harmful health effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gluten sensitivity or hidden allergy to wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt,

<!-- chunk -->

### kamut, and triticale are the most common dietary cause of thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. (Eliminating these is already part of the UltraMind Solution,

<!-- chunk -->

### but I wanted to emphasize that gluten can be a significant factor in

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid problems.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Avoid fluoride (avoid toothpaste with fluoride and filter your water).


<!-- chunk -->

### It

<!-- chunk -->

### has been linked to thyroid problems.

# SUPPORT YOUR THYROID: MEDICAL-CARE PLAN

# TESTING FOR THYROID PROBLEMS

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Testing should include all the thyroid hormones (TSH, free T3, and free

<!-- chunk -->

### T4) and thyroid antibodies (TPO and antithyroglobulin antibodies).

<!-- chunk -->

### Most doctors just check TSH, which is inadequate to identify mild

<!-- chunk -->

### problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Further testing may be necessary and is described in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide.

# CHOOSING THE RIGHT THYROID HORMONE REPLACEMENT

<!-- chunk -->

### To properly balance a thyroid that is severely out of balance, you may

<!-- chunk -->

### need to go on some type of thyroid hormone–replacement therapy. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are certain things you can do by altering your diet and your lifestyle, but if

<!-- chunk -->

### your thyroid isn’t functioning properly you may need to have some

<!-- chunk -->

### additional thyroid hormones to supplement its output. Knowing what’s

<!-- chunk -->

### available and what to ask about can empower you to make better decisions

<!-- chunk -->

### about your health.

<!-- chunk -->

### A combination of experience, testing, and trial and error are necessary to

<!-- chunk -->

### get it just right. However, I have found that the majority of my patients

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit from a combination hormone treatment including T4 and T3.

<!-- chunk -->

### Synthroid, the most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, is just T4,

<!-- chunk -->

### the inactive hormone. Most doctors assume that the body will convert it to

<!-- chunk -->

### T3 and all will be well. Unfortunately, pesticides, stress, mercury,

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, allergies, and selenium deficiencies can block that process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since 100 percent of us have stored pesticides in our bodies, we will all

<!-- chunk -->

### likely have some problem with Synthroid.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common treatment I use is Armour thyroid,


<!-- chunk -->

### a whole

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of thyroid hormones including T4, T3, and T2


<!-- chunk -->

### (a little-

<!-- chunk -->

### known product of thyroid metabolism that actually may be very

<!-- chunk -->

### important).

<!-- chunk -->

### Armour is a prescription drug made from desiccated or dried porcine

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid. It contains the full spectrum of thyroid hormones, including T4,

<!-- chunk -->

### T3, and T2. It seems paradoxical that taking a pig hormone can make your

<!-- chunk -->

### brain better, but it does. The right dose ranges from 15 to 180 mg,

<!-- chunk -->

### depending on the person.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many doctors still hold the outdated belief that the preparation is

<!-- chunk -->

### unstable and the dosages difficult to monitor. That was true with the old

<!-- chunk -->

### preparation of Armour, not the new one. (See www.armourthyroid.com for

<!-- chunk -->

### more information.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the only way to find out if you have a thyroid problem is a

<!-- chunk -->

### short trial of something like Armour thyroid for three months. If you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### better, your symptoms disappear, your mood, memory, and behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### improve, you have more energy, and you lose weight (assuming this a

<!-- chunk -->

### problem for you, which it is for many people with a thyroid deficiency),

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s the right choice. Occasionally, further customization of thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones is necessary using various combinations of T4 and T3 in

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription or compounded forms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once started, it doesn’t have to be taken for life (a common

<!-- chunk -->

### misperception). Once all the factors that disturb your thyroid have been

<!-- chunk -->

### corrected, you may be able to reduce or discontinue the dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### As with any treatment, always work with an experienced physician in

<!-- chunk -->

### using medications for your thyroid. Careful monitoring is essential. Taking

<!-- chunk -->

### too much thyroid hormone, or taking it when you don’t need it, can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### undesirable side effects including anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, and over

<!-- chunk -->

### the long-term, bone loss.

# WARNING

<!-- chunk -->

### If your adrenal glands are burned out from long-term stress, treating the

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid without supporting the adrenal glands through relaxation and the

<!-- chunk -->

### adaptogenic herbs (like ginseng, rhodiola, or Siberian ginseng) can actually

<!-- chunk -->

### make people feel worse. Your Functional Medicine practitioner will know

<!-- chunk -->

### how to balance your adrenals before treating your thyroid with medication.

# Rebalance Your Sex Hormones: Self-Care Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### These two hormone-balancing foods should be included in your diet:

<!-- chunk -->

### Whole traditional soy foods such as tofu, tempeh, miso, natto, and

<!-- chunk -->

### edamame

<!-- chunk -->

### Ground flaxseeds, two tablespoons a day

## Supplements for Sex-Hormone Balance

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to your basic supplement plan, this essential anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### omega-6 fat (GLA or gamma linoleic acid) can help balance sex hormones:

<!-- chunk -->

### Evening primrose oil, 1,000 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs and Phytonutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### The following herbs and phytonutrients can be particularly helpful for

<!-- chunk -->

### women coping with PMS or menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

## For PMS

<!-- chunk -->

### Chasteberry Fruit Extract (Vitex Agnus-astus) can help balance the

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones released by the pituitary gland that control your overall

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone function. Studies of over five thousand women found it

<!-- chunk -->

### effective. Take 100 mg twice a day of a 10:1 extract.

<!-- chunk -->

### DIM (diindolylmethane) is a metabolite of indole-3-carbinol (I3C). Both

<!-- chunk -->

### are found naturally in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, kale, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Brussels sprouts and help improve the detoxification of your sex

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones. Take 100 mg twice a day with food.

<!-- chunk -->

## For Menopause

<!-- chunk -->

### Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa): Black cohosh has been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly reduce hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, irritability,

<!-- chunk -->

### and related occasional sleeplessness. Take 20 mg of black cohosh extract

<!-- chunk -->

### (root and rhizome) twice a day, once in the morning and once in the

<!-- chunk -->

### evening.

# REBALANCE YOUR SEX HORMONES: MEDICAL-CARE PLAN

# TESTING YOUR SEX HORMONES

<!-- chunk -->

### Testing of blood, urine, or saliva can often be helpful in identifying

<!-- chunk -->

### hormonal imbalances such as too much or too little of various hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### This can guide a doctor’s therapy.

# BIOIDENTICAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones interact directly with the brain and affect mood and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition. Occasionally, despite lifestyle therapies, diet, exercise, stress

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction, nutrient supplementation, and herbs, hormone therapy can be

<!-- chunk -->

### lifesaving (as well as mood-and brain-saving).

<!-- chunk -->

### Only a physician knowledgeable and experienced with bioidentical

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone therapy should prescribe them. The only hormones that should be

<!-- chunk -->

### used are ones that are identical to those made by your body. They have

<!-- chunk -->

### very specific actions when they bind to their hormone receptors on your

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. Synthetic or animal hormones typically have unwanted side effects

<!-- chunk -->

### and dangers.

<!-- chunk -->

### For menopause your doctor may try:

<!-- chunk -->

### Topical combinations of estradiol, estriol, progesterone, and testosterone,

<!-- chunk -->

### which are prepared by compounding pharmacies (see Resources for

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations on how to find a doctor).

<!-- chunk -->

### My approach is to use the lowest dose possible to relieve symptoms, to

<!-- chunk -->

### use only bioidentical hormones, and to use them topically (vaginal, skin,

<!-- chunk -->

### under the tongue).

<!-- chunk -->

### Oral hormones should be used with as low a dose as possible and only

<!-- chunk -->

### when topical hormones are not effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA supplementation (see information on adrenal support in chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### 28).

<!-- chunk -->

### For severe cases of PMS not improved by diet, lifestyle, or

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, your doctor may try:

<!-- chunk -->

### Topical, natural, bioidentical progesterone in the last two weeks of the

<!-- chunk -->

### menstrual cycle. The usual dose is one-half teaspoon (20 to 40 mg)

<!-- chunk -->

### applied at night to thin skin areas of your body for the last two weeks of

<!-- chunk -->

### the menstrual cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

### For men’s hormone balance your doctor may use:

<!-- chunk -->

### Testosterone—topical is ideal after measurement of your hormone levels

<!-- chunk -->

### and with ongoing monitoring of testosterone and PSA levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### DHEA supplementation (see adrenal support in chapter 28).


# KEY #3: COOL OFF INFLAMMATION


<!-- chunk -->

### If you have a sore throat, a swollen joint, or a rash, you know you are

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed, but if your brain is inflamed you feel nothing. Nothing, that is, besides

<!-- chunk -->

### being depressed, unfocused, or worse, autistic or demented.

<!-- chunk -->

### If your score on the “Inflammation” quiz in chapter 8 rated you for Self-

<!-- chunk -->

### Care or Medical Care, you need to focus on finding and getting rid of the causes

<!-- chunk -->

### of inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The list of causes is, thankfully, short: an inflammatory, high-sugar,

<!-- chunk -->

### processed-food diet; a sedentary and stressful lifestyle; toxins; infections; and

<!-- chunk -->

### allergens. That’s it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since most of our inflammation is from diet and lifestyle, the treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation comes on your plate and in your shoes. What you eat and how

<!-- chunk -->

### much you exercise are the most important factors governing inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finding the causes of inflammation is not always easy. The most common

<!-- chunk -->

### and obvious causes are our diet and being sedentary. But there are many factors,

<!-- chunk -->

### and at times specialized testing is needed to find hidden causes.

<!-- chunk -->

## The two most common sources of inflammation in the twenty-first

<!-- chunk -->

## century are sugar (and refined carbohydrates) and hidden food

<!-- chunk -->

## allergens (perhaps most important, gluten).

<!-- chunk -->

### Common, but often unrecognized, inflammation comes from hidden food

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies—especially gluten. Eliminating gluten and other delayed IgG food

<!-- chunk -->

### allergens is one of the most powerful treatments I use in my practice.

<!-- chunk -->

### You do this as part of the six-week program.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other, often overlooked, sources of inflammation are mold in your

<!-- chunk -->

### surroundings in damp basements or moldy bathrooms, or hidden in the walls of

<!-- chunk -->

### your house: environmental allergies, a hidden infection such as a virus, parasite,

<!-- chunk -->

### or bacteria that doesn’t cause immediately obvious symptoms; or a medication

<!-- chunk -->

### you are taking, and even toxins such as mercury or pesticides.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress may also make you inflamed.

<!-- chunk -->

### And while just sitting around doing nothing also causes inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### regular exercise is one of the best-known anti-inflammatories on the planet.


<!-- chunk -->

### Multivitamins are also a great natural inflammation-fighting tool.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes locating and eliminating the sources of inflammation requires

<!-- chunk -->

### detective work, testing, and working with an experienced doctor, but the results

<!-- chunk -->

### for your brain, your weight, and your health will be worth the effort.


<!-- chunk -->

### Cooling off inflammation requires only a few basic steps

<!-- chunk -->

## Eat an Anti-Inflammatory Diet

<!-- chunk -->

### The six-week plan is designed to be anti-inflammatory, but be sure to add

<!-- chunk -->

### extra anti-inflammatory herbs in your cooking:

<!-- chunk -->

### Add anti-inflammatory herbs, including turmeric (a source of curcumin),

<!-- chunk -->

### ginger, and rosemary, to your diet daily.

<!-- chunk -->

## Get Rid of Hidden Food Allergies

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people suffer needlessly with hidden food sensitivities and allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most powerful, immediate, and dramatic results you can achieve for

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing systemic inflammation is to eliminate the most common food allergens

<!-- chunk -->

### in your diet: gluten, dairy, eggs, yeast, corn, peanuts, citrus, and occasionally

<!-- chunk -->

### soy.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the six-week plan in Part III, I have provided you a method for

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating the top two allergens—gluten and dairy—from your diet. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### because these are the most common allergens that affect the brain and benefit

<!-- chunk -->

### almost everyone.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, for some people the other food allergens mentioned above may

<!-- chunk -->

### be a problem. If you still experience problems with inflammation after the six-

<!-- chunk -->

### week program is over, you may need to go on a more rigorous elimination and

<!-- chunk -->

### reintroduction program.

<!-- chunk -->

### The UltraSimple Diet provides all the guidance, tools, and resources for you

<!-- chunk -->

### to do this successfully. If you follow the UltraMind Solution and the Self-Care

<!-- chunk -->

### program for six weeks and don’t get the results you expect, I strongly suggest

<!-- chunk -->

### you do the program outlined in The UltraSimple Diet for two weeks, then

<!-- chunk -->

### reintroduce foods slowly to identify the connection between what you are eating

<!-- chunk -->

### and how you feel.

<!-- chunk -->

### For most of you, eliminating gluten and dairy (by far the worst culprits) will

<!-- chunk -->

### give you significant anti-inflammatory benefit without having to do The

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraSimple Diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Special Note: Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates

<!-- chunk -->

### The biggest cause of inflammation in our culture is belly fat resulting from

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin resistance. Too much sugar promotes high insulin levels, which trigger a

<!-- chunk -->

### domino effect leading to system-wide damage, including inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fixing insulin resistance by following the recommendations for healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### eating in Part III will take care of much of the inflammation we see from our diet

<!-- chunk -->

### other than hidden food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements to Reduce Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### The nutritional supplement recommendation in Part III, including a

<!-- chunk -->

### multivitamin, omega-3 fats, and vitamin D, all have powerful anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits. Here are some additional anti-inflammatory supplements that can be

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful:

<!-- chunk -->

### Turmeric—the yellow spice found in curry is the best anti-inflammatory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take 200 mg twice a day with food.

<!-- chunk -->

### A well-researched combination of anti-inflammatory herbs (including

<!-- chunk -->

### turmeric, ginger, and rosemary) can be used. Take one softgel of

<!-- chunk -->

### Zyflamend by New Chapter twice a day with meals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Enzymes, four capsules twice a day between meals for six weeks

<!-- chunk -->

### (bromelain and other proteolytic enzymes).


<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Testing for inflammation may include C-reactive protein (a generalized

<!-- chunk -->

### marker for inflammation), autoimmune markers (ESR, anti-CCP, TPO,

<!-- chunk -->

### ANA), or food allergies (IgG or IgE), and celiac-or gluten-testing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Testing for hidden infections, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and

<!-- chunk -->

### yeast, may also be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Specific treatments for infections or more aggressive treatments for

<!-- chunk -->

### autoimmunity and allergies may be needed.


# KEY #4: FIX YOUR DIGESTION

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most powerful things you can do to fix your brain is fix your gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### The link is clear, and the results are often immediate and dramatic. Clear out the

<!-- chunk -->

### bad bugs, eliminate food allergens, support digestion with enzymes, add in

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy bacteria or probiotics, prebiotics (fiber fertilizer for probiotics), healing

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients, and learn to find the pause button so your second brain can relax too.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is an easy, clear, and simple process that, if followed, can achieve

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatic results quickly, not only for your brain and mood, but also for your

<!-- chunk -->

### overall health and well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once your gut is healthy you can keep toxins and allergens out, cool off

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, and digest and absorb all the nutrients you need to run your body

<!-- chunk -->

### and your brain at top performance.


<!-- chunk -->

### Often you can heal your gut by taking the few simple steps I describe below.

<!-- chunk -->

## A Gut-Healing Diet

<!-- chunk -->

### The whole, real, fresh-food eating plan in Part III that includes the

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination of dairy and gluten, sugars, and sugar alcohols may by itself

<!-- chunk -->

### do much to heal your gut.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you scored in the Self-Care section on the “Gut” quiz or if you always

<!-- chunk -->

### feel bloated after eating, follow the UltraMind Solution (Part III) and

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate all grains and beans from your diet for six weeks (these foods

<!-- chunk -->

### are easily fermented and feed yeast and bacteria). This may “starve” the

<!-- chunk -->

### yeast or bacteria, and may be enough for many to heal the gut without

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics or antifungals that clear out the bad bugs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lifestyle Factors and Your Gut

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the dietary factors above, the following lifestyle changes can

<!-- chunk -->

### also help you heal your gut:

<!-- chunk -->

### Chew each mouthful of food twenty-five to fifty times—or at least try!

<!-- chunk -->

### This releases EGF (epithelial growth factor), needed for repair and

<!-- chunk -->

### healing of the digestive lining.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eat slowly and do not do anything else while eating. Remember, it takes

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty minutes for the brain to get the message that the stomach is full.

<!-- chunk -->

### Never eat standing up.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gut-Healing Supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to taking the probiotics included in the six-week UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution, taking digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid at the onset of a gut-

<!-- chunk -->

### healing program is very effective. The enzymes help break down the food and

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent food allergies and the harmful effects of partially digested food products,

<!-- chunk -->

### which trigger allergy. The overgrowth of bacteria in your gut can ferment these

<!-- chunk -->

### half-digested starches and cause more havoc, such as bloating and gas.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is what I suggest.

<!-- chunk -->

## Enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### You should take a good, plant-based, broad-spectrum digestive enzyme. This

<!-- chunk -->

### should contain enzymes that break down proteins (proteases), fats (lipases), and

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates (amylases). There is also an important enzyme found to be

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly helpful in addressing neurological issues that result from partially

<!-- chunk -->

### digested gluten and dairy. It is called DPP IV. Anyone who scored high enough

<!-- chunk -->

### to work the steps in this chapter should:

<!-- chunk -->

### Take two capsules of broad-spectrum enzymes containing proteases,

<!-- chunk -->

### lipases, and amylases with each meal for at least six months while your

<!-- chunk -->

### gut is healing.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hydrochloric Acid Support

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of us think that too much stomach acid is our problem, and for some it

<!-- chunk -->

### may be. But often, digestive problems occur because of weak stomach acid,

<!-- chunk -->

### which actually can, in some cases, be the cause of reflux and heartburn. Acid-

<!-- chunk -->

### blocking medications often compound the problem. Adequate stomach acid is

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to break down food and activate digestive enzymes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Betaine or hydrochloric-acid supplements must be used carefully and

<!-- chunk -->

### usually under the supervision of a health-care practitioner. But they can often be

<!-- chunk -->

### very helpful while your gut is healing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start with one capsule or tablet at the beginning of each meal. Increase

<!-- chunk -->

### the dose by one capsule per meal until you have a warm feeling in your

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach. Then drop back down to the dose just before the warm feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### occurred.

<!-- chunk -->

## A Special Probiotic: Yeast against Yeast

<!-- chunk -->

### A basic probiotic supplement is necessary for the six-week UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution. But there is a unique and often helpful probiotic that many find

<!-- chunk -->

### counterintuitive—why would we take one strain of yeast to kill other yeasts? It

<!-- chunk -->

### has profound benefits in controlling diarrhea, fighting other yeasts in the gut,

<!-- chunk -->

### controlling bad bugs such as Clostridia, improving gut immunity, improving

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive enzyme function, reducing inflammation, and improving overall gut

<!-- chunk -->

### function. I find it is one of the mainstays of my gut-repair program. Take:

<!-- chunk -->

### Saccharomyces boulardii, 150 mg to 250 mg (3 billion to 5 billion CFUs)

<!-- chunk -->

### one or two times a day on an empty stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gut Repair: Healing Nutrients and Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### Specialized gut-support products and nutrients are often necessary for gut

<!-- chunk -->

### healing and repair. These are the final tools for correcting digestive problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### healing a leaky gut, and reducing relapse or recurrence of digestive, immune,

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The following should be taken for three months, depending on the severity

<!-- chunk -->

### of symptoms and response to treatment. Add a few other supplements at the

<!-- chunk -->

### repair stage (after removing the bad bugs, allergens, and toxins). These

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds needed for gut repair can be divided into two main categories:

<!-- chunk -->

### Gut Food

<!-- chunk -->

### Glutamine, 2,500 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### You can use the powder or capsule form.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a nonessential amino acid that is the preferred fuel for the lining of

<!-- chunk -->

### the small intestine and can greatly facilitate healing. It can be taken for

<!-- chunk -->

### one to two months. It generally comes in powder form and is often

<!-- chunk -->

### combined with other compounds that facilitate gut repair.

<!-- chunk -->

### Gut Anti-inflammatories

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercitin, 500 mg twice a day with food and other bioflavonoids

<!-- chunk -->

### This potent anti-inflammatory is helpful in restoring balance in the gut.


<!-- chunk -->

### Very often some simple dietary changes and supplements can help

<!-- chunk -->

### overcome years of digestive problems and help improve the secondary

<!-- chunk -->

### mood and brain dysfunction that results. However, this is an area where it

<!-- chunk -->

### is often helpful to have some testing and to work with a doctor of

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine who knows how to address and work with digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The healing process takes four main steps, which have to be done in the

<!-- chunk -->

### right order for you to get the best results. This is often referred to as the 4R

<!-- chunk -->

### program.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Remove any offending factors, including potential food allergens;

<!-- chunk -->

### overgrowth of bacteria, yeast, parasites; and toxins such as heavy metals

<!-- chunk -->

### (see chapters 10 and 26 on detoxification).

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Replace missing or weakened enzymes, acid, and fiber or prebiotics to

<!-- chunk -->

### help fertilize the healthy bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Reinnoculate with probiotics or beneficial bacteria.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Repair the intestinal lining with healing nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eliminating allergens and taking enzymes, prebiotics, probiotics, and

<!-- chunk -->

### healing nutrients can be done without medical care, except if you have a

<!-- chunk -->

### significant overgrowth of bacteria in your small intestine, yeast

<!-- chunk -->

### overgrowth, infestation with parasites, or heavy metal toxicity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Testing is often needed to identify these problems. Then medication is

<!-- chunk -->

### often needed for adequate treatment. Sometimes herbs can be helpful as

<!-- chunk -->

### well in reducing the bad bugs. So you can try working through fixing your

<!-- chunk -->

### gut on your own, but if things don’t improve it may be time for testing and

<!-- chunk -->

### medication with your doctor’s help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember, if you are standing on a tack it takes a lot of aspirin to feel

<!-- chunk -->

### better. If you have too much bacteria, yeast, or a parasite, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate all the foods you like or add all the healthy bacteria, but it may

<!-- chunk -->

### be an uphill battle unless you fully address any imbalances or infections

<!-- chunk -->

### with bugs in the gut.

# SPECIAL NOTE: TREATING BUGS

<!-- chunk -->

### Bugs that affect the gut come in three main varieties.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Bacteria

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Yeast

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Parasites

<!-- chunk -->

### Each type of bug needs different treatment. Testing can identify which

<!-- chunk -->

### bug or bugs are a problem for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal therapies can often be helpful, but most of the time a short course

<!-- chunk -->

### of curative medication is necessary and dramatically effective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Guidance from a trained practitioner is often necessary to test for and

<!-- chunk -->

### treat these problems. You can also get more information and a detailed

<!-- chunk -->

### guide for testing and treatment of bad bugs in your gut by going to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide and downloading the companion guide for this

<!-- chunk -->

### book. It includes not only additional information on healing your gut but

<!-- chunk -->

### also many other tips and tools to make this program more powerful and

<!-- chunk -->

### easier to follow.


# KEY #5: ENHANCE DETOXIFICATION

<!-- chunk -->

### The sustainability of our environment is directly connected to the

<!-- chunk -->

### sustainability of our health. Identifying if and how we are toxic, and addressing

<!-- chunk -->

### it directly by changing our habits, our choices, and our purchases in the

<!-- chunk -->

### marketplace, can have a global effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### The connection between toxins and their effects on our brains are well

<!-- chunk -->

### established. The link between our addiction to energy, industrialization, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### millions of pounds of chemicals and heavy metals released every year into our

<!-- chunk -->

### environment, and the epidemics of autism, ADHD, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mood disorders, as well as heart disease, obesity, and cancer, should make us

<!-- chunk -->

### all stop and think about how we live.

<!-- chunk -->

### Small choices can make a big difference. Imagine if one day everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### shifted to organic food, or as they did in Europe, to non-GMO food (genetically

<!-- chunk -->

### modified organisms). It would change the agriculture industry overnight.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why I believe it is important for everyone to live clean and green.

<!-- chunk -->

### In most cases, the techniques for limiting your exposure to environmental

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins I outlined in Part III will help you detoxify and stay free of toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### substances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, in some cases people have already been exposed to so much

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic material they need a little extra help. If you scored over 6 on the “Toxins”

<!-- chunk -->

### quiz, this may apply to you.

<!-- chunk -->

### In this case, learning how your body’s own detoxification system works,

<!-- chunk -->

### and how to optimize its function, is key to achieving and maintaining optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### health. There is no great mystery on how do to this.


<!-- chunk -->

### There are a few simple things you can do to boost your detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Support for Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, plants have evolved many protective defenses against pests and

<!-- chunk -->

### infection, called phytonutrients. Many of these also help human biology to

<!-- chunk -->

### function better—especially in the realm of detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### These defenses are better developed in organic foods because they have to

<!-- chunk -->

### work harder to survive. Eating organic food provides higher concentrations of

<!-- chunk -->

### these protective detoxifying, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory compounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### These compounds may outweigh the benefits we can get from other nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements in their overall effects on our health.

<!-- chunk -->

### And they taste better!

<!-- chunk -->

## The Detox Powerhouses

<!-- chunk -->

### While I recommend these healing foods as part of the basic eating plan in

<!-- chunk -->

### Part III of the UltraMind Solution, it is worth emphasizing how important they

<!-- chunk -->

### are, and ensuring that you include these in your daily diet. There are many others

<!-- chunk -->

### that help in detoxification, including cilantro, celery, parsley, dandelion greens,

<!-- chunk -->

### citrus peels, and rosemary, but these are the ones I want you to be sure to include

<!-- chunk -->

### in your diet as often as possible—even daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, collards, kale, Brussels

<!-- chunk -->

### sprouts, Chinese cabbage, bok choy, arugula, radish, wasabi, water-cress,

<!-- chunk -->

### kohlrabi, mustard greens, rutabaga, turnips). Eat at least one to two cups,

<!-- chunk -->

### cooked, daily.

<!-- chunk -->

### Curcuminoids (turmeric and curry)

<!-- chunk -->

### One to two cups of green tea a day boosts liver detoxification (increases

<!-- chunk -->

### GST or glutathione enzymes).

<!-- chunk -->

### High-quality sulfur-containing proteins or foods—eggs, garlic (a few

<!-- chunk -->

### cloves a day), onions

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements to Enhance Detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many detoxification pathways—or routes for toxins to get out of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. But these pathways require many helpers. Vitamins, minerals, amino

<!-- chunk -->

### acids, special nutrients, and a whole range of phytonutrients from the foods

<!-- chunk -->

### noted above are needed for our detox system to function day in and day out.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I explained in chapter 10, the most important factor for our

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification system is keeping our glutathione levels up. Glutathione is the

<!-- chunk -->

### main detoxifier in the body (an antioxidant and immune booster). Our body

<!-- chunk -->

### needs to regenerate it all the time. That is why we need to keep the sulfation

<!-- chunk -->

### train and the methylation train running smoothly. Our brains and our health

<!-- chunk -->

### depend on it.

<!-- chunk -->

### The main nutrients helpful in boosting glutathione are all the methylation

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients, zinc, and selenium that are part of your basic supplement program.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, as far as my personal supplement program goes, besides taking a

<!-- chunk -->

### multivitamin and fish oil, supporting my glutathione levels is the most important

<!-- chunk -->

### thing I do every day for my health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are some additional supplements you can take to do that:

<!-- chunk -->

### N-acetylcysteine or NAC, 500 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a special amino acid that dramatically increases glutathione. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### even used in the emergency room to treat liver failure from Tylenol

<!-- chunk -->

### overdose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Buffered ascorbic acid (vitamin C), 1,000 mg twice a day in addition to

<!-- chunk -->

### what is in your basic multivitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### Buffered vitamin C with mineral ascorbates in powder, capsule, or tablets

<!-- chunk -->

### during periods of increased detoxification is especially useful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Too much vitamin C may cause diarrhea. Simply reduce the dose.

<!-- chunk -->

### Milk thistle (silymarin), 140 mg twice a day of a standardized extract

<!-- chunk -->

### This herb has long been used in liver disease and helps boost glutathione

<!-- chunk -->

### levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hyperthermic Therapy or Heat Therapy (Saunas)

<!-- chunk -->

### Saunas and heat therapies are an ancient method of cleansing. The Native

<!-- chunk -->

### American sweat lodge was a tool for physical and spiritual purification. Today,

<!-- chunk -->

### the Environmental Protection Agency has shown that sauna therapy increases

<!-- chunk -->

### excretion of heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, and fat-soluble chemicals—

<!-- chunk -->

### PCBs, PBBs, and HCBs). It seems science has finally caught up with these

<!-- chunk -->

### historical practices for maintaining health.

<!-- chunk -->

### The process of liberating fat-stored toxins through sweating must be done

<!-- chunk -->

### carefully and sometimes under a doctor’s supervision to prevent complications.

<!-- chunk -->

### Follow these guidelines for safe detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

## Saunas or Steam Baths

<!-- chunk -->

### Find a health club or gym near you that has a sauna or steam room.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drink at least sixteen ounces of purified water before entering the sauna.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drink during the treatment if you can, and at least sixteen ounces after the

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy to help flush the mobilized toxins through your kidneys and

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation. Drink more if you are thirsty.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are generally healthy, start with ten minutes and increase by five

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes daily to a maximum of thirty to forty-five minutes. You should

<!-- chunk -->

### take cold dips or rinses in the shower every ten minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are chronically ill, or take medication, be sure to get your doctor’s

<!-- chunk -->

### permission and start with five minutes and increase gradually as

<!-- chunk -->

### tolerated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sauna temperatures should be no higher than 140 to 150 degrees

<!-- chunk -->

### Farenheit for those with environmental illness or a history of increased

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic exposures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Far infrared saunas are used at lower temperatures and may be more

<!-- chunk -->

### easily tolerated than regular saunas for liberating stored toxins. They may

<!-- chunk -->

### also be more effective at helping you get rid of stored toxins. (See

<!-- chunk -->

### Resources for suggestions.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Shower thoroughly with soap after the sauna to remove the liberated

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins from your skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### For those needing an intensive detoxification program, daily saunas for

<!-- chunk -->

### six weeks can be dramatically helpful with once-a-week maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy afterward.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some people have symptoms from the release of toxins, including skin

<!-- chunk -->

### rashes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, irritable bowel, and confusion or

<!-- chunk -->

### memory problems. If you experience these side effects, take buffered

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin C or get the help of a Functional Medicine practitioner.


<!-- chunk -->

### In a medically supervised detoxification program, many other

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients, herbs, and phytonutrients may be used, including alpha lipoic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid, bioactive whey protein, amino acids such as taurine, glycine,

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamine, calcium-D-glucarate, and methionine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Specialized tests, which assess your body’s detoxification system,

<!-- chunk -->

### including genetic testing for detoxification enzymes, and tests for heavy

<!-- chunk -->

### metals, including tests of blood, urine, and hair, may be necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### Detoxifying from heavy metals is an important step on the road to health

<!-- chunk -->

### for many and needs to be done with an experienced and qualified health-

<!-- chunk -->

### care practitioner.

# SPECIAL NOTE: DETOXIFYING FROM HEAVY METALS

<!-- chunk -->

### Aside from addressing hidden food allergens and helping people

<!-- chunk -->

### balance their blood sugar and consume a whole-foods diet, one of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful ways to correct many chronic health problems is a medically

<!-- chunk -->

### supervised heavymetal detoxification program.

<!-- chunk -->

### Proper testing, preparation, and care are needed in order for safe and

<!-- chunk -->

### effective heavymetal detoxification. Below you will find the steps I often

<!-- chunk -->

### recommend just to prepare my patients for heavymetal detoxification. I

<!-- chunk -->

### will also outline options available for treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to reinforce that this must be done with a qualified health-care

<!-- chunk -->

### practitioner.

<!-- chunk -->

### Below I describe the most important steps to help prepare you for safe

<!-- chunk -->

### metal removal. Once you have improved your health and optimized your

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification system, you can begin working to remove metals from your

<!-- chunk -->

### body through various approaches, including safe amalgam removal (see

<!-- chunk -->

### www.iaomt.org) and the use of chelating agents such as DMSA, which is a

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription medication designed and approved for lead removal in

<!-- chunk -->

### children, but also effective for mercury and many other toxic metals.

<!-- chunk -->

### While there needs to be more research in this area, the current body of

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence, my experience, and the experience of thousands of other doctors

<!-- chunk -->

### and patients make it clear to me that this can be a critical part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### process of healing for chronic illness, including mood, behavior, and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative diseases such as autism, ADHD, and dementia.

<!-- chunk -->

### For an excellent consensus position paper on heavymetal detoxification

<!-- chunk -->

### developed by the group involved with autism treatment called DAN! see

<!-- chunk -->

### www.autism.com/triggers/vaccine/heavymetals.pdf.

# GETTING READY FOR DETOXIFICATION

<!-- chunk -->

### These are the general guidelines I use with my patients for you to

<!-- chunk -->

### follow with your doctor. They should generally be done in collaboration

<!-- chunk -->

### with your health-care practioner and may take a few months.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Optimize Gut Function —First optimize your gut function by

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminating the common food allergens and taking probiotics and

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes for one to two months before detoxifying.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Optimize Your Nutritional Status for Detoxification —You can do this by

<!-- chunk -->

### using healthy fats (omega-3 fats, olive oil, and flax oil), the amino acids

<!-- chunk -->

### found in plants and lean animal proteins (which boost your liver’s

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification capacity), and minerals, particularly zinc and selenium

<!-- chunk -->

### (which help your body detoxify metals).

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Enhance Your Liver’s Detoxification Pathways —Especially the

<!-- chunk -->

### sulfation and methylation pathways—by taking folate, B


<!-- chunk -->

### , and

<!-- chunk -->

### eating foods that contain sulfur, such as broccoli, collards, kale, daikon

<!-- chunk -->

### radish, garlic, onions, and omega-3 eggs, as well as supplements such as

<!-- chunk -->

### alpha lipoic acid and n-acetylcysteine.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Use Herbal Support for HeavyMetal Detoxification —Include alginate,

<!-- chunk -->

### cilantro, garlic, and milk thistle.

<!-- chunk -->

## 5. Start Sauna Therapy —Make sure you take adequate electrolyte and

<!-- chunk -->

### mineral replacement to prevent dehydration and mineral loss from the

<!-- chunk -->

### sweat.

<!-- chunk -->

## 6. Optimize Elimination Routes for Metals —This includes your urine,

<!-- chunk -->

### stool, and sweat by drinking plenty of clean pure water, eating a diet

<!-- chunk -->

### high in plant fibers, and taking daily saunas for thirty minutes.


# KEY #6: BOOST ENERGY METABOLISM

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy is something we lose with age. But it can also be lost because of

<!-- chunk -->

### anything that triggers more free radicals and oxidative stress or damage to our


<!-- chunk -->

### Even as we are learning how mitochondrial injury is a final common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway in so many neurological and psychiatric disorders, fortunately we are

<!-- chunk -->

### also learning how to protect and defend ourselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Getting a metabolic tune-up is not only possible, but also necessary for

<!-- chunk -->

### most of us. This is especially true for those whose score indicates either Self-

<!-- chunk -->

### Care or Medical Care in the quiz in chapter 11.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thankfully, by eating a plant-based diet, reducing toxic exposures, and

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing with mitochondrial protective and antioxidant compounds, we

<!-- chunk -->

### can protect and restore our energy metabolism to optimal function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Here is what you need to do to boost your energy metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Changes to Boost and Improve Energy Production

<!-- chunk -->

### The dietary factors that boost your energy metabolism are already built into

<!-- chunk -->

### the UltraMind Solution. Just be sure to focus on antioxidant-rich foods such as

<!-- chunk -->

### yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, blueberries, red grapes, spinach, green

<!-- chunk -->

### tea, and the herbs turmeric, ginger, and garlic. The darker and richer the color,

<!-- chunk -->

### the more potent the antioxidants and energy boosters are in food.

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplements to Boost Energy and Reduce Oxidative Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### The super nutrients that fire up your energy factories or mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### include:

<!-- chunk -->

## Super Mitochondrial-Boosting Nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a number of special nutrients that are not “essential” but become

<!-- chunk -->

### essential under conditions of stress, toxicity, and aging and can dramatically

<!-- chunk -->

### improve energy production, improve mitochondrial function, and protect the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria from damage. The most important are:

<!-- chunk -->

### Acetyl-L-carnitine, 500 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### Alpha lipoic acid, 100 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### Coenzyme Q10, 100 mg a day

<!-- chunk -->

### D-ribose, 5 gm a day in powder

<!-- chunk -->

### NADH, 10 mg a day

<!-- chunk -->

### This energy booster is taken as a tablet that dissolves under your tongue.

# Lifestyle Changes for Boosting Energy

<!-- chunk -->

### The most important lifestyle factor for supporting your mitochondria and

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing your energy is exercise. In Part III, I have outlined some exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### options for you to follow. If you don’t exercise and you scored high in this key,

<!-- chunk -->

### you need to get moving.

<!-- chunk -->

### I particularly recommend using an interval training program. It will give

<!-- chunk -->

### you an excellent aerobic workout and it will save you time.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have outlined a complete interval training program in The UltraMind

<!-- chunk -->

### Solution Companion Guide. Please go to www.ultramind.com/guide and

<!-- chunk -->

### download this free guide if you want to learn more.


<!-- chunk -->

## 1. There are a number of tests, including those of organic acids and

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiometabolic stress testing as well as tests for oxidative stress (8

<!-- chunk -->

### OHDG, or lipid peroxides), that help your doctor personalize treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### and monitor your progress.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Additional supplements, including creatine, NAC, sulfate, and reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### glutathione, may also be recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Resveratrol derivatives or extracts are powerful mitochondrial energy

<!-- chunk -->

### boosters and are in drug development now (Sirtris was just purchased by

<!-- chunk -->

### GlaxoSmithKline).

<!-- chunk -->

## 4. Your doctor may prescribe additional energy-boosting treatments and

<!-- chunk -->

### exercises such as interval training.


# KEY #7: CALM YOUR MIND

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of us were never trained to calm ourselves. Unless, of course, we do it

<!-- chunk -->

### with a big jelly doughnut or a glass of chardonnay. A runaway stress response

<!-- chunk -->

### has become a part of our daily lives, but most of us are unaware that we are in a

<!-- chunk -->

### perpetual state of alarm. It is just how we are.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our bodies and brains react to stress immediately and constantly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unrelieved stress triggers biological responses that become worn into deep

<!-- chunk -->

### grooves in our moods and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Of course, we know that stress can result from psychological causes—

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling powerless and helpless at work or in our relationships—in other words,

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes. But toxic foods, environmental toxins,

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive problems, and even infections can also trigger the same biological

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response.

<!-- chunk -->

### That is why each of us must find a way to push our pause button on a daily

<!-- chunk -->

### basis. Most of us don’t even know where it is. But we must learn how to identify

<!-- chunk -->

### the ways in which we are stressed, try to minimize them, and then actively learn

<!-- chunk -->

### to engage the relaxation response or the pause button. This is key to long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### brain health. We have to make it part of our daily lives.

<!-- chunk -->

### Identifying what is stressing you out and learning to press the pause button

<!-- chunk -->

### are critically important, especially when you are out of balance in this key. If you

<!-- chunk -->

### scored over 7 on the “Adrenal Dysfunction” quiz, the following steps may help

<!-- chunk -->

### you find balance again.


<!-- chunk -->

### Practicing Self-Care to calm your mind is relatively easy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Identify and Reduce the Causes of Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Looking closely at the habits of our life—both what we do and how we think

<!-- chunk -->

### —is not something most of us do on a regular basis. We often don’t connect the

<!-- chunk -->

### choices we make in our diet, in our relationships, or in our work with how we

<!-- chunk -->

### feel every day. Nor do we equate the way we feel with the use of brain-altering

<!-- chunk -->

### substances like sugar, caffeine, and alcohol.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a big disconnect for many in understanding that the way we live

<!-- chunk -->

### our lives makes us sick and leads to trouble focusing, thinking, remembering, or

<!-- chunk -->

### just feeling happy and alive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eating junk food, drinking six cups of coffee a day, having those two

<!-- chunk -->

### cocktails at night to calm down, watching four hours of television a day, doing

<!-- chunk -->

### work we hate, or being stuck in relationships that don’t give us peace or joy—we

<!-- chunk -->

### tend to accept these without too much thought about how they drive our moods

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### We cannot eliminate all the causes of stress, but we can take an inventory—

<!-- chunk -->

### a close examination of our life—and consider which things we can let go of that

<!-- chunk -->

### are triggering stress and which things we can add that help us heal and thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Consider which things give you energy and which things deplete it. Take a

<!-- chunk -->

### piece of paper, and in one column write down all those things that rob you of

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. Beside it, in another column, write down all the things that give it to you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Make an agreement with yourself to eliminate at least one thing this week

<!-- chunk -->

### that robs you of energy and add one thing to your life that gives you energy. Do

<!-- chunk -->

### this once a week during the six-week program.

<!-- chunk -->

### For those things you cannot eliminate, you can transform your way of

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking about them. You can move from your ordinary thinking to extraordinary

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking about your life, from thinking that creates “dis-ease” to thinking that

<!-- chunk -->

### creates well-being for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### For now, make a list of your own stressors. I have included a simple form to

<!-- chunk -->

### do this in The UltraMind Solution Companion Guide. Go to

<!-- chunk -->

### www.ultramind.com/guide to download the guide.

<!-- chunk -->

## Social or Psychosocial Stressors

<!-- chunk -->

### Thoughts and beliefs about ourselves

<!-- chunk -->

### Jobs

<!-- chunk -->

### Relationships

<!-- chunk -->

### Financial situation

<!-- chunk -->

### Kids

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychological disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.)

<!-- chunk -->

### Low self-esteem

<!-- chunk -->

### The state of the world (i.e., the international political situation, problems

<!-- chunk -->

### in your neighborhood, etc.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Stressors

<!-- chunk -->

### Overweight or obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic illness

<!-- chunk -->

### Allergens

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup

<!-- chunk -->

### Saturated and trans fats

<!-- chunk -->

### Processed foods

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic infections

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol, tobacco, drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you have made a list of your various stressors, try to think of ways

<!-- chunk -->

### that you might eliminate them. In some cases, this is easy. For example, if you

<!-- chunk -->

### are sitting watching four hours of television a day or drinking half a bottle of

<!-- chunk -->

### wine every night, these might be physical stressors for you. Instead of watching

<!-- chunk -->

### TV you can take an hour to move your body or do something else that gives you

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. Instead of drinking half a bottle of wine every night, you can choose to

<!-- chunk -->

### drink less.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other cases, it may be more difficult. If you are dealing with chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological or health issues, for example, it will probably take some energy to

<!-- chunk -->

### get them worked out.

<!-- chunk -->

### But always remember you can take some action to reduce the amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### stress in your life.

<!-- chunk -->

## Find the Pause Button: Learning Life Skills for Thriving

<!-- chunk -->

### My three favorite tools for pushing my pause button are described in Part III

<!-- chunk -->

### and in other keys. They are:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Soft-Belly Breathing (the UltraMind Solution)

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. The UltraBath (the UltraMind Solution)

<!-- chunk -->

## 3. Hyperthermic or Sauna Therapy (Enhance Detoxification)

<!-- chunk -->

### You need to find your own favorites: try to incorporate a few of these

<!-- chunk -->

### during your six-week program.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Pause Button Pushers

<!-- chunk -->

### Yoga is a wonderful way to increase fitness and flexibility, calm your

<!-- chunk -->

### mind, and deeply relax. There are classes in almost every town. My

<!-- chunk -->

### favorite yogic technique is called yogic sleep or yoga “nidra.” See the

<!-- chunk -->

### Resources for recommendations on CDs, videos, and DVDs for yoga and

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Massage. Learn massage and use it on your partner or friends. And then

<!-- chunk -->

### exchange. Or get a massage as often as you can.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tense and relax. By slowly tensing and relaxing your whole body (all at

<!-- chunk -->

### once or moving progressively from one muscle group to the next—face,

<!-- chunk -->

### neck and shoulders, arms, legs) and then relaxing your whole body (or

<!-- chunk -->

### each muscle group progressively), you will shift the stress response and

<!-- chunk -->

### enter into deep relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use biofeedback. There are some wonderful computer-simulated tools and

<!-- chunk -->

### devices that can lead you through various mental and physical exercises

<!-- chunk -->

### that will activate the stress response. See the Resources for some options.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just load it into your computer, put three little sensors on your fingers

<!-- chunk -->

### that measure your heart rate variability, and take a journey into deep

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Learn meditation. Mindfulness meditation is a powerful, well-researched

<!-- chunk -->

### tool developed by Buddhists, but now practiced and used all over the

<!-- chunk -->

### world, thanks to the work of Jon Kabat Zinn, Ph.D., of the University of

<!-- chunk -->

### Massachusetts, in many hospitals and medical centers. Read his book

<!-- chunk -->

### Wherever You Go, There You Are to learn basic meditation techniques or

<!-- chunk -->

### attend a local class on meditation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pray, chant, dance, and celebrate. All these are ancient tools for healing

<!-- chunk -->

### and all help you deeply relax. Just pull down the shades, turn on the

<!-- chunk -->

### music, and dance in your living room.

<!-- chunk -->

### Practice tai qi quan or qi gong. These are ancient, energy-balancing tools

<!-- chunk -->

### that can help restore your health and calm your nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Writing away stress. Journaling is a well studied and powerful tool to help

<!-- chunk -->

### improve mood and become more intimate with yourself. Studies show

<!-- chunk -->

### how it boosts immunity and improves mood.


<!-- chunk -->

### Daily journaling for twenty minutes can be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

### You can also try this well-researched tool, which can create immediate

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits: Set aside twenty minutes four days a week to write in your journal.

<!-- chunk -->

### Write nonstop about the most upsetting or traumatic experience of your life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Don’t worry about spelling or grammar. Write about all your emotions and

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts, as many details as you can remember, and any insights you have.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be in nature. A walk in the woods, or on the beach, a hike up a mountain,

<!-- chunk -->

### and watching a sunset all have soothing effects on us and help us push

<!-- chunk -->

### that pause button.

<!-- chunk -->

### Listen to music. Certain types of music have soothing effects on our

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system. Listen to Bach, Chopin, Mozart, Pachelbel, and Vivaldi.

<!-- chunk -->

### Or to traditional types of music such as Benedictine monks chanting or

<!-- chunk -->

### Sanskrit chants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Be artful. Painting, drawing, sculpting, or participating in any of the arts

<!-- chunk -->

### engages our brains and minds, creating a soothing and calming effect.

<!-- chunk -->

## Use Stress-Reducing Supplements and Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### Nutrients help regulate and control all the hormones and neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in brain function and in the stress and relaxation responses. Stress can

<!-- chunk -->

### also quickly deplete the very nutrients needed for deep relaxation of the nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system, including magnesium, the B vitamins, and vitamin C. These stress-

<!-- chunk -->

### reducing supplements are included in the basic recommendations for long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements in Part III.

<!-- chunk -->

## Herbs to Help You Adapt and Respond to Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain herbs help you adapt better to stress. If you want to add another

<!-- chunk -->

### dimension to your stress reduction program, try these herbal remedies alone or in

<!-- chunk -->

### combinations. You can reduce the overactivity and increase the resilience of the

<!-- chunk -->

### system by using adaptogenic (named that way because they may help you adapt

<!-- chunk -->

### to stress) or balancing herbs such as:

<!-- chunk -->

### Asian Ginseng Root Extract (Panax ginseng)—standardized to 8 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### (16 mg) ginsenosides—200 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhodiola Root Extract (Rhodiola rosea)—standardized to 1 percent (0.5

<!-- chunk -->

### mg) salidroside—100 mg twice a day

<!-- chunk -->

### Siberian Ginseng (Eleuthrococcus senticosus)—root, standardized to

<!-- chunk -->

### contain 0.8 percent eleutherosides—250 mg twice a day


<!-- chunk -->

## 1. Your doctor may recommend testing for stress hormones or heart rate

<!-- chunk -->

### variability.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2. Occasionally hormonal treatment with DHEA or low-dose cortisone can

<!-- chunk -->

### be helpful if you have adrenal burnout.

# SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS


<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the steps outlined in the six-week program and the keys, there

<!-- chunk -->

### are a few special considerations I would like to address before I close.

# When You Need Therapy

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes it is not a toxin, allergen, infection, or nutrient-poor diet that

<!-- chunk -->

### makes us depressed or mentally ill. Sometimes it is just life itself—a divorce,

<!-- chunk -->

### childhood trauma, the death of a loved one, a crazy boss, or a major trauma.

<!-- chunk -->

### During those times in life, seeking help from a trained psychotherapist, a

<!-- chunk -->

### social worker, or even a personal coach can be lifesaving and may help guide

<!-- chunk -->

### you through troubled times.

<!-- chunk -->

### In traditional cultures, the family and social structure provided a container

<!-- chunk -->

### and meaning for all life’s events. Today, unfortunately, many of us are left alone

<!-- chunk -->

### to struggle through life’s transitions and questions. Getting support can help you

<!-- chunk -->

### heal and recover along with the UltraMind Solution.

# When You Need Medication

<!-- chunk -->

### As a former emergency room physician, I recognize that extreme times call

<!-- chunk -->

### for extreme measures. I use and support the intelligent, appropriate use of

<!-- chunk -->

### medication, including psychotropic medications when needed. They can often be

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful as a bridge for recovery from all the stresses and toxins that affect our

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### It may take months or years to heal from damage that has occurred over a

<!-- chunk -->

### lifetime. In extreme cases, the damage may be so deep that full recovery is not

<!-- chunk -->

### possible using the UltraMind Solution (although most see remarkable results in a

<!-- chunk -->

### few weeks). In some cases, combining medication with the tools of the

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution can give people their lives back.

<!-- chunk -->

### Working with an experienced psychopharmacologist who welcomes the

<!-- chunk -->

### integration of nutrition, supplements, exercise, and mind-body therapies is

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes a necessary step to recovering a whole life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many times medications can be reduced or eliminated after applying the

<!-- chunk -->

### principles found in the UltraMind Solution .

<!-- chunk -->

### I would caution you that psychotropic medications offer only partial

<!-- chunk -->

### solutions, often packaged with side effects. Tread intelligently, expect bumps on

<!-- chunk -->

### the road, and seek to find the causes of your suffering, which may be found in

<!-- chunk -->

### the stories of your life, on your plate, in your lifestyle, or in your toxic

<!-- chunk -->

### environment. You will rarely find the solution to your problems in a prescription

<!-- chunk -->

### bottle.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you need to, use medication without guilt just as you would any other

<!-- chunk -->

### tool to rebuild your life. And do not be afraid to put it down when you have

<!-- chunk -->

### rebuilt your health and your world.

# Special Herbs for the Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### A few other herbs and nutrients deserve special mention. I often find these

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial in patients with mood or memory problems. I encourage you to work

<!-- chunk -->

### with your health-care practitioner when you use these herbs and nutrients. They

<!-- chunk -->

### can be used safely and effectively for many.

<!-- chunk -->

## Memory-Enhancing Herbs

<!-- chunk -->

## Huperzine A

<!-- chunk -->

### Huperzine A is derived from Chinese club moss and has shown significant

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits in dementia with few side effects. Clinical trials have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

### huperzine A is comparably effective to the drugs currently on the market, and

<!-- chunk -->

### may even be a bit safer in terms of side effects. It works by increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine in the brain, in a similar way to the current medications for

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Currently, the National Institute on Aging is conducting a Phase II clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### trial to evaluate the safety and efficiency of huperzine A in the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease in a randomized controlled trial of its effect on cognitive


<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended dose is 100 mcg twice a day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vinpocetine

<!-- chunk -->

### Vinpocetine is an extract of the periwinkle plant. More than fifty studies

<!-- chunk -->

### have found it effective in improving blood flow to the brain, improving energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production in the brain, and preventing blood clots.

<!-- chunk -->

### The recommended dose is 5 to 10 mg twice a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you are taking blood-thinning medicine, do not take this herb.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ginkgo biloba

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginkgo biloba is a powerful brain antioxidant and improves circulation. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine for memory

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Take Ginkgo Leaf Extract 80 to 160 mg twice a day (Ginkgo biloba)—

<!-- chunk -->

### standardized to 24 percent ginkgoflavonglycosides and 6 percent terpene

<!-- chunk -->

### lactones.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mood-Enhancing Herbs and Supplements

<!-- chunk -->

## St. John’s Wort

<!-- chunk -->

### St. John’s Wort contains many phytonutrients, called hypericins, that are

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful in the treatment of depression. It can be helpful in those with serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency or with anxiety or sleep problems. Do not combine this with any other

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants or psychotropic medication (such as MAO inhibitors).

<!-- chunk -->

### The therapeutic dose is 300 to 450 mg twice a day.

<!-- chunk -->

## SAMe

<!-- chunk -->

### SAMe is an amino acid that is formed as part of your methylation cycle. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has been researched extensively and found effective for depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Start with a dose of 400 mg four times a day, or 800 mg twice a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### A response usually occurs within three weeks and you can then reduce the

<!-- chunk -->

### dose to 400 mg twice a day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Use with your methylation supplement and magnesium.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have bipolar disorder, use this amino acid only with your doctor’s

<!-- chunk -->

### supervision.

# CONCLUSION

<!-- chunk -->

## The Future of Medicine


<!-- chunk -->

### You will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known

<!-- chunk -->

### and exist, before it is generally received and practiced upon.

<!-- chunk -->

### —

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of my patients know intuitively that their various complaints must be

<!-- chunk -->

### related in some fashion. They don’t know exactly what’s wrong or how to find

<!-- chunk -->

### the answers, but they know that it is not in the type of medical care we have now.

<!-- chunk -->

### They understand that a health-care system focused on specialization and

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmacologic treatments of specific “diseases” often misses the underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### story of the origins and the reasons for their suffering.

<!-- chunk -->

### They intuitively know that a new approach to medicine, one in which we

<!-- chunk -->

### treat the underlying systems that cause disease when they are out of balance,

<!-- chunk -->

### would work better than the paradigm we are currently stuck in. They know this

<!-- chunk -->

### even if they have never heard the terms Functional Medicine or “systems

<!-- chunk -->

### biology.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Nonetheless, I, like almost every other doctor in the country, was trained to

<!-- chunk -->

### be a clinical pharmacologist, not a clinical physiologist, biochemist, geneticist,

<!-- chunk -->

### or practitioner of Functional Medicine. I was trained to dispense medication. I

<!-- chunk -->

### was not trained to process or understand biological information systems, or to

<!-- chunk -->

### make sense of patterns and relationships and connections in biological systems. I

<!-- chunk -->

### was not trained to see how everything communicates with everything else.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, by treating thousands of patients like Clayton (whom you learned

<!-- chunk -->

### about in Part I) and all the others you have learned about in this book for more

<!-- chunk -->

### than twenty years, and by studying the rich medical literature that explains, in

<!-- chunk -->

### detail, the way the underlying systems in our body create health or illness, I have

<!-- chunk -->

### been able to develop a whole new way of understanding medicine, one that is

<!-- chunk -->

### radically different than the method of diagnosis and treatment I was trained in.

<!-- chunk -->

### We are in the middle of an information revolution—not just in technology

<!-- chunk -->

### but also in biology. What I have studied and learned about for more than a

<!-- chunk -->

### decade now is the future of medicine. Functional Medicine and systems biology

<!-- chunk -->

### are the wave of the future, and it is what you just learned while you read The

<!-- chunk -->

### UltraMind Solution.

# Looking in the Wrong Place for Answers

<!-- chunk -->

### Could it be that we are looking in the wrong place for the answers to our

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemic of neurological and psychiatric disorders? Could it be that the

<!-- chunk -->

### medications we use for mood and brain disorders attempt to control the smoke

<!-- chunk -->

### while ignoring the fire?

<!-- chunk -->

### Could it be that these are, in fact, not primary brain disorders at all, but

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic disorders that affect the brain? And could it be that therapies primarily

<!-- chunk -->

### aimed at altering brain function through antidepressants, stimulants,

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotics, and seizure medications may miss the primary mechanisms or

<!-- chunk -->

### disturbances that show up as behavioral, mood, or neurological symptoms?

<!-- chunk -->

### New research shows clearly that the communication between the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### the body is bidirectional. Even though Mind-Body Medicine has been studied

<!-- chunk -->

### and accepted as legitimate,


<!-- chunk -->

### it provides only a one-dimensional view of the

<!-- chunk -->

### interaction between the brain and the body.


<!-- chunk -->

### The conclusion from the science is irrefutable and must be heeded to

<!-- chunk -->

### effectively address the epidemic of “broken brains”—mood disorders, attention

<!-- chunk -->

### deficit disorder, autism, psychoses, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unless we focus on the metabolic, nutritional, and environmental influences

<!-- chunk -->

### that exert their effects on the brain through the body, we will not succeed in our

<!-- chunk -->

### efforts to promote mental and cognitive well-being.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next frontier in medicine is to define how “body” dysfunction or

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances lead to abnormal brain chemistry and communication between brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, altered behavior, mood, and neurodegeneration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Today there is a new model of thinking in medical science. It is called

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine. It provides a new road map for navigating the mysteries of

<!-- chunk -->

### how the body works together as a whole system.

<!-- chunk -->

### Science is by nature reductionistic, breaking things into smaller and smaller

<!-- chunk -->

### parts and learning what each of them do separately. But what is missing in

<!-- chunk -->

### science is synthesis and integration. Putting the pieces of the puzzle back

<!-- chunk -->

### together. There are millions of bits of data and information, and yet for most

<!-- chunk -->

### practitioners of medicine they are strewn about the floor like a million puzzle

<!-- chunk -->

### pieces.

<!-- chunk -->

### Until we put the pieces of the puzzle together, we cannot see what picture it

<!-- chunk -->

### forms, or what story it tells us about the mystery of how the body works, and

<!-- chunk -->

### how the mind, brain, and body are all connected and intertwined.

<!-- chunk -->

### Functional Medicine is a method of putting those pieces together so we can

<!-- chunk -->

### see the picture of the whole clearly. It is not a new treatment or test or a new

<!-- chunk -->

### alternative method. It is just a way of putting together the pieces of the puzzle of

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic disease in a new way so we can truly see what is going on. It is a

<!-- chunk -->

### practical method of approaching each patient as an individual.

<!-- chunk -->

### The era of treating all depressed or anxious or ADHD or autistic or

<!-- chunk -->

### demented people the same way is over. There may be dozens of causes of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression or autism or dementia or ADHD. Finding the right cause and

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for each individual will require a different way of practicing medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is a radical shift from our conventional training where we use

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms to make a diagnosis and then match a drug to that diagnosis. The

<!-- chunk -->

### science of genomics and molecular biology is forcing us to radically redefine

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. Could it be that many different “diseases” show up as the same

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms? For example, can a nutritional deficiency, or a toxic level of mercury,

<!-- chunk -->

### or a food allergy all cause memory problems, attention deficit disorder, or

<!-- chunk -->

### depression?

<!-- chunk -->

### Today we know that they can.

<!-- chunk -->

### The symptoms may be exactly the same for people with the same label or

<!-- chunk -->

### “disease,” but the causes and treatment are completely different. The body (or

<!-- chunk -->

### brain) has only so many ways of saying ouch—sadness, happiness, anxiousness,

<!-- chunk -->

### forgetfulness, trouble with attention—but the reasons each person has that

<!-- chunk -->

### experience may be completely different.

<!-- chunk -->

### So how can we find a new model that gets to the root of the problem?

<!-- chunk -->

### This model already exists. This new medical paradigm has been laid out in

<!-- chunk -->

### detail in The Textbook of Functional Medicine (to which I contributed two

<!-- chunk -->

### chapters). It is a story of how all the pieces of the puzzle that create disease and

<!-- chunk -->

### promote health fit together. It is based on excellent science. There are about

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty thousand scientific references, and contributions from scientific giants.

<!-- chunk -->

### This model is the medicine of the future, but it is available to you today. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is what the seven keys to UltraWellness and the UltraMind Solution are based

<!-- chunk -->

### on, and it is what you have already begun to learn about in the pages of this

<!-- chunk -->

### book.

<!-- chunk -->

### But this road map is focused mostly on basic research. The practical

<!-- chunk -->

### application of this thinking is not being explored directly. But people do not need

<!-- chunk -->

### to wait twenty years to take advantage of this thinking. It is available now and it

<!-- chunk -->

### is the approach of Functional Medicine, or what I call UltraWellness

<!-- chunk -->

### (www.ultrawellness.com).

<!-- chunk -->

### It is only by teasing apart how each of these fundamental physiological

<!-- chunk -->

### processes alters brain function and studying how correcting them can restore

<!-- chunk -->

### normal function that a new model of psychiatry, neurology, and clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroscience can emerge; one that provides more satisfactory answers than only

<!-- chunk -->

### partially effective pharmacologic treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### The paradox is that in the detail of any one pattern or system of physiologic

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance, the answer will not be found. It is only by putting together all the

<!-- chunk -->

### pieces of the puzzle, by assessing and treating all the imbalanced systems

<!-- chunk -->

### (nutritional, hormonal, inflammatory, immune, digestive, toxic, energy

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and oxidative stress, and mind-body) simultaneously that true

<!-- chunk -->

### advances can occur.

<!-- chunk -->

### Single drugs or methods are destined to fail. The nature of biology is that of

<!-- chunk -->

### a system, one whole, interdependent, interconnected system.

<!-- chunk -->

### In order to make real progress we must understand how our genes are

<!-- chunk -->

### affected by environment and lifestyle and how that leads to disturbances in

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular communication, physiology, and biochemistry, which are responsible for

<!-- chunk -->

### much of the accelerating rate of psychiatric and neurological disease in the

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty-first century.

<!-- chunk -->

### This new thinking will provide relief for millions if applied deliberately and

<!-- chunk -->

### carefully.

# ACKNOWLEDG MENTS

<!-- chunk -->

### The opportunity to write a book is both a gift and a burden. Its virtues are

<!-- chunk -->

### more often borrowed, and its errors entirely my own. It is a journey supported by

<!-- chunk -->

### the vast community I find myself living in and exploring with wonder.

<!-- chunk -->

### The community that wrote this book through me includes all the scientists

<!-- chunk -->

### who worked thanklessly to understand the mysteries of the human body and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, and made all the puzzle pieces I put together in this story. It also includes

<!-- chunk -->

### all my patients who trusted me, then worked with me to find the answers to their

<!-- chunk -->

### health and struggles with broken bodies and broken brains. They taught me more

<!-- chunk -->

### than they realized.

<!-- chunk -->

### My agent Richard Pine, with patience, clarity, insight, and an uncommon

<!-- chunk -->

### directness, has guided this book from the beginning, as usual in his understated

<!-- chunk -->

### loving way. Beth Wareham, my editor; Susan Moldow, my publisher; and all my

<!-- chunk -->

### friends and supporters at Simon & Schuster have supported me from the

<!-- chunk -->

### beginning to the end, over and over again believing in and making possible the

<!-- chunk -->

### birth of sometimes radical and often unexpected ideas. Sandi Mendelson, my

<!-- chunk -->

### publicist, and her team chip away at the noise in the media to get the truth to

<!-- chunk -->

### break through. Marc Stockman just “gets it” like no one else. He took

<!-- chunk -->

### scribblings on a napkin and helped me create a world of good from a naked hope

<!-- chunk -->

### for change. It was a good day when you showed up. Jeff Radich, who creates

<!-- chunk -->

### beauty and mini-miracles from my too often rough work. And Jessica Cerretani,

<!-- chunk -->

### who takes the edges off my writing and makes it go down easier. Liana Baum for

<!-- chunk -->

### her help making ideas into pictures. And Spencer Smith, my comrade in words

<!-- chunk -->

### who has given more than his mind to this book. He has given his heart and soul

<!-- chunk -->

### often when there was little left. Thank you!!!

<!-- chunk -->

### The community that helped me write this book extends to well over a

<!-- chunk -->

### hundred people, all of whom I unfortunately can’t name here. You know who

<!-- chunk -->

### you are—thank you, thank you, and thank you. I must mention a few special

<!-- chunk -->

### people who have inspired, helped, and supported me—Jeffrey Bland, who

<!-- chunk -->

### cracked open my world twelve years ago and it has never been the same; Sidney

<!-- chunk -->

### Baker, one of the greatest unrecognized and original thinkers of our time—in

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine and in life; my friends at the Institute for Functional Medicine—

<!-- chunk -->

### Laurie, David, Bethany, Robert, Jennifer, Joe, and Susan, and the many unnamed

<!-- chunk -->

### who just make it happen at IFM. And all those who have supported me from the

<!-- chunk -->

### beginning with their time and money to launch the future of medicine: John

<!-- chunk -->

### Bitzer, Stephen and Sandy Muss, Maja Hoffmann and Stanley Buchthal,

<!-- chunk -->

### Adelaide Gomer, Alicia Wittink, Ritchie Scaife, Jerry and Emy Lou Baldridge,

<!-- chunk -->

### Donna Karan, Daphne Barak, and so many more, including those who have yet

<!-- chunk -->

### to know how great a difference they can make with so little.

<!-- chunk -->

### And without friendship and my whole community I couldn’t do what I do—

<!-- chunk -->

### thank you for being there even when I am not—and for those unnamed, you who

<!-- chunk -->

### all know who you are: Marc David, David and Zea Piver, Jonathan and Michelle

<!-- chunk -->

### Kalman, Dan and Ditte Ruderman, Paul and Andrea DeBotton, Andy and Lisa

<!-- chunk -->

### Corn, Davidi and Ruth Gilo, David Ludwig, and the list goes on and on. I want

<!-- chunk -->

### to especially thank my good friend Damon Giglio, a generous and passionate

<!-- chunk -->

### soul who has given of himself over and over to be a catalyst for transformation

<!-- chunk -->

### and good in the world. And of course, there are all my cocreators of medicine’s

<!-- chunk -->

### transformation who have touched me and taught personally, and each continue to

<!-- chunk -->

### create seismic shifts in our way of thinking and living. Thank you for supporting

<!-- chunk -->

### me and trusting me and guiding me: Dean Ornish, Mehmet C. Oz, James

<!-- chunk -->

### Gordon, Andrew Weil, Jon Kabat Zinn, Leo Galland, David Perlmutter, Frank

<!-- chunk -->

### Lipman, Jay Lombard, Patrick Hanaway, Robert Hedaya, Joel Evans, Catherine

<!-- chunk -->

### Willner, David Eisenberg, Bethany Hayes, David Jones, Tracy Gaudet, Kirk

<!-- chunk -->

### Daffner, Kenneth Pelletier, Peter Libby, and Martha Herbert.

<!-- chunk -->

### My whole life would have taken a different turn if not for Kathie Swift, my

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritionist, and coconspirator who first inspired me to ask the questions that

<!-- chunk -->

### ultimately led to this book. Her tireless hours of assistance, work, dedication to

<!-- chunk -->

### our patients, to food, and to our work to change health care, in more ways than I

<!-- chunk -->

### can count, are essential to my life. Thank you. Without the support of my team at

<!-- chunk -->

### the UltraWellness Center, where I do my real work of seeing patients, I couldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### begin to do half of everything else. You are all my foundation and at the core of

<!-- chunk -->

### my life. Your contributions wash over me daily, thank you for showing up and

<!-- chunk -->

### believing. Thank you Donna, Liz, Deb, Heather, Maggie, Pam, Sarah, and Erica.

<!-- chunk -->

### And Nina—you are the glue that makes everything stick together and the balm

<!-- chunk -->

### that gets our patients well when nothing else has.

<!-- chunk -->

### Last, and most important, my family has put up with the dangers of my

<!-- chunk -->

### passion (early mornings, late nights, and too many absences to remember). I

<!-- chunk -->

### could not have done this without all your love and belief in what I am doing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thank you Pier, Rachel, Misha, Thor, Ace, Ruth, Richard, Saul, Jesse, Carrie,

<!-- chunk -->

### Michael, Ben, Sarah, Paul, Lauren, Jake, and Zachary. It is for you and because

<!-- chunk -->

### of you that I wake up every day grateful and joyful.

### * Brain allergies are reactions to food that can take many forms, including

### mood disorders, attention deficit disorder, autism, insomnia, and just plain brain

### fog.

†

<!-- chunk -->

### Autoimmunity is an abnormal immune response to the body’s own tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### It usually occurs because of “molecular mimickry,” which is where the body

<!-- chunk -->

### confuses some of its own tissue with a foreign invader. In this case, antibodies

<!-- chunk -->

### against gluten also attack your own tissue.

*

<!-- chunk -->

### Those who have an SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) or genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### variation of the enzyme THP2 have an 80 percent reduction in ability to make

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that you can overcome this weakness by taking folate and

<!-- chunk -->

### the supplement 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan), which is normally produced from

<!-- chunk -->

### 5-HTP dietary tryptophan, the molecule that is the next step in the process of

<!-- chunk -->

### making serotonin. If you take 5-HTP, you skip that weak step.

### Dr. Robert Heaney, one of the world’s leading vitamin D researchers, in a

<!-- chunk -->

### recent groundbreaking editorial in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

### about the delayed (yet very serious) consequences of taking less than the optimal

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts of nutrients for life, said that “because the current [vitamin]

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendations are based on the prevention of [deficiency] disease only, they

<!-- chunk -->

### can no longer be said to be biologically defensible. The pre-agricultural human

<!-- chunk -->

### diet... may well be a better starting point for policy. The burden of proof should

<!-- chunk -->

### fall on those who say that these more natural conditions are not needed and that

<!-- chunk -->

### lower intakes [of nutrients] are safe.”

<!-- chunk -->

### * Testing for heavy metals is performed by taking a chelating agent, then

<!-- chunk -->

### collecting your urine to measure the amount your body excretes. This test is

<!-- chunk -->

### usually done only by Functional Medicine doctors or doctors specially trained in

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification.

<!-- chunk -->

### † Removal of dental mercury or silver fillings should be performed only by a

<!-- chunk -->

### biological dentist. See www.iaomt.org to find a biological dentist.

<!-- chunk -->

### * Bioidentical hormones are hormones identical to those made by your body,

<!-- chunk -->

### rather then synthetic hormone molecules, which have more side effects and

<!-- chunk -->

### increased risks.

<!-- chunk -->

### †Note that for this quiz there are only two scores. Low-level problems are

<!-- chunk -->

### treated on the six-week program. If you have severe problems, I strongly

<!-- chunk -->

### encourage you to seek the assistance of a physician trained in Functional

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Grass-fed means that the animals you eat spend their lives roaming and

<!-- chunk -->

### eating grass in a pasture, as they evolved doing. Grass-fed animals are not closed

<!-- chunk -->

### up in a stockyard, which means they have much less need for antibiotics. In

<!-- chunk -->

### addition, they move and eat a healthier, more natural diet, which means they are

<!-- chunk -->

### leaner. And they eat grass, which leads to higher amounts of omega-3 fats,

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamins, and minerals in the meat than grain-fed animals.
