# Brain Energy

# Praise for Brain Energy

<!-- chunk -->

### “Brain Energy is a dramatic breakthrough in understanding mental illness

<!-- chunk -->

### by a leading Harvard psychiatrist who provides a revolutionary road map

<!-- chunk -->

### for people suffering from depression, anxiety, bipolar disease, in fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### almost any brain disorder. The discoveries of brain science have forced us

<!-- chunk -->

### to reimagine mental health and provide hope in a field that for many has not

<!-- chunk -->

### provided significant relief from suffering. If you suffer any mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### challenges (who hasn’t), then this book just might change your life.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Mark Hyman, MD, senior advisor at the Cleveland Clinic Pr_R for

<!-- chunk -->

## Functional Medicine and 14-time New York Times bestselling author

<!-- chunk -->

### “Brain Energy provides a long-awaited unifying mechanism underlying a

<!-- chunk -->

### vast spectrum of mental illness conditions. And this new paradigm will

<!-- chunk -->

### undoubtedly usher in potent therapeutic interventions for pervasive

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric conditions for which standard pharmaceutical approaches have

<!-- chunk -->

### proven minimally effective. Christopher Palmer’s work empowers patients

<!-- chunk -->

### and their health care providers alike.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —David Perlmutter, MD, #1 New York Times bestselling author of

<!-- chunk -->

## Grain Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### “Dr. Palmer takes a provocative and insightful look into the origins of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, which have profound implications for how we treat the

<!-- chunk -->

### disease . . . and for our diet.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Jason Fung, MD, nephrologist and author of three bestselling health

<!-- chunk -->

## books

<!-- chunk -->

### “Psychiatry will never be the same. The medical profession needs to apply

<!-- chunk -->

### Biochem 101 if it’s going to solve mental illness—and metabolic illness,

<!-- chunk -->

### while they’re at it. Christopher Palmer poses the hypothesis, supports it

<!-- chunk -->

### with data, and, in my humble opinion, nails the treatment: feed the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### what it needs.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Robert H. Lustig, MD, MSL, emeritus professor of pediatrics at

<!-- chunk -->

## UCSF and author of Metabolical

<!-- chunk -->

### “For more than two decades, Dr. Palmer has organized world leaders in

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatry to educate clinicians about emerging innovations in the field. He

<!-- chunk -->

### challenges the status quo with this brave new idea in Brain Energy that

<!-- chunk -->

### instructs us to seek simple solutions to human problems, rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical ones that can only change biology, not lived experience. Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy is a book all psychiatric professionals should read as a useful

<!-- chunk -->

### criticism of our field’s major deficits. It is a book all people should read to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand how much they can

<!-- chunk -->

### do (and not do) for the sake of their mental health. Basic health is self-

<!-- chunk -->

### evident but takes courage to commit to taking exquisite care of your body

<!-- chunk -->

### and, by extension, your brain.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Lois W. Choi-Kain, MD, MEd, director of the Gunderson Personality

<!-- chunk -->

## Disorders Institute and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard

<!-- chunk -->

## Medical School

<!-- chunk -->

### “After a bipolar episode at age nineteen, our son was seen by more than

<!-- chunk -->

### forty mental health practitioners and prescribed twenty-nine different

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. But it was not until he started on a ketogenic metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy under the guidance of Dr. Chris Palmer that he got his mind and his

<!-- chunk -->

### life back. Dr. Palmer’s metabolic approach has the potential to radically

<!-- chunk -->

### impact the world’s mental health epidemic. Brain Energy is a must-read.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —David Baszucki, founder and CEO of Roblox and cofounder of the

<!-- chunk -->

## Baszucki Group, and Jan Ellison Baszucki, author of A Small

<!-- chunk -->

## Indiscretion and cofounder of the Baszucki Group

<!-- chunk -->

### “If you have ever been dissatisfied with the rather hard-to-defend

<!-- chunk -->

### explanations of mental illness, this groundbreaking book is for you. Palmer,

<!-- chunk -->

### a practicing psychiatrist, not constrained by the received wisdom of the

<!-- chunk -->

### field, audaciously travels further than most. He puts forward a strong case

<!-- chunk -->

### for throwing away what we were taught about the causes, the diagnosis, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Instead, he brings the tiny

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, once mere bacteria, into center stage and takes you on an

<!-- chunk -->

### exhilarating intellectual journey to reveal the new beginnings of

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatry.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Zoltán Sarnyai, MD, PhD, professor and head of the Laboratory of

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychiatric Neuroscience, James Cook University, Australia

<!-- chunk -->

### “Dr. Christopher Palmer has written a must-read primer for anyone

<!-- chunk -->

### considering understanding and treating mental health. The book will guide

<!-- chunk -->

### you to understand why metabolism and mitochondria are fundamental to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep your brain healthy . . . a call to action to transform mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment. Read this book—and learn from one of the best.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Ana C. Andreazza, PhD, professor of pharmacology and psychiatry,

<!-- chunk -->

## University of Toronto and founder and scientific director,

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondrial Innovation Initiative

<!-- chunk -->

### “Dr. Palmer is uncanny in his synthesizing extant literature and providing a

<!-- chunk -->

### prescient thesis on the pathoetiologic and potentially therapeutic role of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolics of neuropsychiatric conditions. The thesis and framework

<!-- chunk -->

### proffered by Dr. Palmer provides for many

<!-- chunk -->

### prevention and therapeutic opportunities in psychiatry and take us one step

<!-- chunk -->

### closer to disease-modifying possibilities.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Roger S. McIntyre, MD, FRCPC, professor of psychiatry and

<!-- chunk -->

## pharmacology at the University of Toronto, Canada

<!-- chunk -->

### “Brain Energy, by Dr. Chris Palmer, is the much-needed new perspective on

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health that could revolutionize the way we think about, research, and

<!-- chunk -->

### treat mental health conditions. It’s a guaranteed best-seller, a book you

<!-- chunk -->

### won’t want to put down, and one that could change your life or that of a

<!-- chunk -->

### loved one. The nuance, clarity, and sensitivity with which Dr. Palmer

<!-- chunk -->

### addresses the complex issues of mental illness is nothing short of

<!-- chunk -->

### incredible. He brings his skills as a Harvard-trained clinical psychiatrist to

<!-- chunk -->

### bear in his writing, anticipating the reader’s next question and then weaving

<!-- chunk -->

### it into a narrative that is the perfect mix between science lesson and

<!-- chunk -->

### storybook. Filled with brilliant analogies, jaw-dropping statistics,

<!-- chunk -->

### fascinating scientific details, and moving patient stories, this book is an

<!-- chunk -->

### absolute must-read. And, speaking as both a PhD scientist myself and a

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvard medical student, I wish this book could be mandatory reading for

<!-- chunk -->

### the next generation of doctors. If it were, I’d suspect we’d see rates of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic diseases, including mental health conditions, start to dip within a

<!-- chunk -->

### generation. This book will change many lives.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Nicholas Norwitz, PhD in neurometabolism (University of Oxford)

<!-- chunk -->

## and Harvard Medical Student

<!-- chunk -->

### “There is so much we do not know about the relationship among

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, health, and disease. Thankfully, Dr. Christopher Palmer cuts

<!-- chunk -->

### through the noise and tackles mental disorders by focusing on first

<!-- chunk -->

### principles: metabolism is the foundation of brain health, and brain health is

<!-- chunk -->

### the foundation of our best future. Brain Energy is a book that cannot be

<!-- chunk -->

### read and incorporated into policy soon enough: mental disorders are an

<!-- chunk -->

### accelerating crisis, especially among children. This is not rocket science;

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s neuroscience.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Susan A. Masino, PhD, professor of applied science and

<!-- chunk -->

## neuroscientist at Trinity College

<!-- chunk -->

### “Kudos to Dr. Chris Palmer for penning a thought-provoking and superb

<!-- chunk -->

### book on the revolutionary breakthroughs occurring in psychiatry, a

<!-- chunk -->

### discipline in medicine that has suffered far too long and from too much

<!-- chunk -->

### stigma. It’s a must-read for all of us as we undoubtedly,

<!-- chunk -->

### without exception, have a family member or a dear friend battling a

<!-- chunk -->

### challenging psychiatric condition. There is finally optimism and light at the

<!-- chunk -->

### end of the dark tunnel.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Sanjiv Chopra, MBBS, MACP, FRCP, professor of medicine at

<!-- chunk -->

## Harvard Medical School and bestselling author

<!-- chunk -->

### “It is clear to me from clinical practice that what we eat and drink affects

<!-- chunk -->

### our brain function and mental health but I never understood why. Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### Palmer brilliantly connects the dots to explain why this is true. A pioneering

<!-- chunk -->

### work!”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Eric C. Westman, MD MHS, director of the Duke Keto Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

## Clinic

<!-- chunk -->

### “Dr. Palmer’s Brain Energy seemed to take me by the hand and gently walk

<!-- chunk -->

### me through the most complex of medical journeys—arriving at the most

<!-- chunk -->

### fascinating yet incredibly logical conclusions. Though not a scientist, I was

<!-- chunk -->

### able to follow and actually become riveted during every step of the journey.

<!-- chunk -->

### His rare ability to explain sophisticated scientific and medical concepts in

<!-- chunk -->

### lay terminology makes it accessible to a very wide audience. His case is

<!-- chunk -->

### carefully and thoroughly constructed. The dots are always connected. His

<!-- chunk -->

### frequent use of anecdotes and examples is also helpful. Visualizing

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism by comparing it to automobile traffic is kind of brilliant.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turning the Titanic of the understanding of mental health from genetic to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic underpinnings is not going to be easy, but Brain Energy seems to

<!-- chunk -->

### be a huge swing in the right direction.”

<!-- chunk -->

## —Jim Abrahams, director of The Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic

<!-- chunk -->

## Therapies

<!-- chunk -->

### “Not since the foundational theories of psychodynamics (Sigmund Freud)

<!-- chunk -->

### and behaviorism (John Watson) has a bold and potentially transformative

<!-- chunk -->

### new proposition emerged to explain the mounting epidemic of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness throughout the world and across the age-span. Dr. Chris Palmer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### groundbreaking theory is that abnormalities in brain energy metabolism are

<!-- chunk -->

### likely root causes of psychiatric conditions and that dietary and metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### approaches can be exploited to benefit patients, and even the general

<!-- chunk -->

### population at large. Brain Energy is a must-read for everyone interested in

<!-- chunk -->

### brain and mental health.”

# Introduction

<!-- chunk -->

### or more than twenty-five years as a psychiatrist and neuroscience

<!-- chunk -->

### researcher, I have been asked the question “What causes mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness?” countless times by patients and their family members. When I

<!-- chunk -->

### first began my career, I would give long answers that made me sound

<!-- chunk -->

### educated and competent. I’d talk about neurotransmitters, hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

### genetics, and stress. I would describe the treatments we would be using and

<!-- chunk -->

### offer hope that they would make things better. After a few years of this,

<!-- chunk -->

### however, I began to feel like a fraud. You see, people often weren’t getting

<!-- chunk -->

### that much better. Treatments would sometimes work for a few months, or

<!-- chunk -->

### even a year or two, but more often than not, the symptoms would come

<!-- chunk -->

### back. At some point, I began telling people the simple truth: “No one knows

<!-- chunk -->

### what causes mental illness.” Although we understand many risk factors, no

<!-- chunk -->

### one knows how they all fit together. I still tried to offer hope by assuring

<!-- chunk -->

### people that we had many different treatments at our disposal and that we

<!-- chunk -->

### would try one after another until we found one that worked. Sadly, for many

<!-- chunk -->

### of my patients, we never did.

<!-- chunk -->

### That all changed for me in 2016 when I helped a patient lose weight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tom was a thirty-three-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder, a cross

<!-- chunk -->

### between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. He had suffered from

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations, delusions, and mental anguish every day of his life over the

<!-- chunk -->

### last

<!-- chunk -->

### thirteen years. He was tormented by his illness. He had tried seventeen

<!-- chunk -->

### different medications, but none had worked. The medications sedated him,

<!-- chunk -->

### which reduced his anxiety and agitation, but they didn’t stop his

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations or delusions. What’s more, they’d caused him to gain over

<!-- chunk -->

### one hundred pounds. He had long been plagued by low self-esteem, and

<!-- chunk -->

### being so overweight only added to this. He had become a near hermit, and

<!-- chunk -->

### our weekly sessions were some of his only excursions into the outside

<!-- chunk -->

### world. This is partly why I agreed to help him lose weight: I was the doctor

<!-- chunk -->

### he saw most often, and he wasn’t in the market for a referral to a specialist

<!-- chunk -->

### he’d never met. More to the point, it was highly unusual for him to take

<!-- chunk -->

### action to improve his health in some way. Maybe losing weight could help

<!-- chunk -->

### him gain a sense of control over his life. After experimenting with several

<!-- chunk -->

### approaches without success, we decided to try the ketogenic diet—a diet

<!-- chunk -->

### low in carbohydrates, moderate in protein, and high in fat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within weeks, not only had Tom lost weight, but I began to notice

<!-- chunk -->

### remarkable and dramatic changes in his psychiatric symptoms. He was less

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed and less sedated. He began making more eye contact, and when

<!-- chunk -->

### he did, I saw a presence and spark there that I had never seen before. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### astonishingly, after two months, he told me that his longstanding

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations were receding and that he was rethinking his many paranoid

<!-- chunk -->

### conspiracy theories. He began to realize that they weren’t true and probably

<!-- chunk -->

### never had been. Tom went on to lose 150 pounds, move out of his father’s

<!-- chunk -->

### home, and complete a certificate program. He was even able to perform

<!-- chunk -->

### improv in front of a live audience, something that would have been

<!-- chunk -->

### impossible for him prior to the diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### I was flabbergasted. I had never seen anything like this in my entire

<!-- chunk -->

### career. While it’s possible that losing weight might reduce anxiety or

<!-- chunk -->

### depression in some people, this man had a psychotic disorder that had

<!-- chunk -->

### resisted more than a decade of treatment. Nothing in my knowledge or

<!-- chunk -->

### experience suggested that the ketogenic diet would treat his symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### There seemed to be no reason it should.

<!-- chunk -->

### I began digging into the medical literature and discovered that the

<!-- chunk -->

### ketogenic diet is a longstanding, evidence-based treatment for epilepsy. It

<!-- chunk -->

### can

<!-- chunk -->

### stop seizures even when medications fail to. I quickly realized an important

<!-- chunk -->

### connection—we use epilepsy treatments in psychiatry all the time. They

<!-- chunk -->

### include medications like Depakote, Neurontin, Lamictal, Topamax, Valium,

<!-- chunk -->

### Klonopin, and Xanax. If this diet also stops seizures, maybe that’s why it

<!-- chunk -->

### was helping Tom. Based on this additional information, I began using the

<!-- chunk -->

### ketogenic diet as a treatment with other patients and when it continued to be

<!-- chunk -->

### successful, I soon found myself collaborating with researchers around the

<!-- chunk -->

### world to explore it further, speaking globally on this topic, and publishing

<!-- chunk -->

### papers in academic journals demonstrating its effectiveness.

<!-- chunk -->

### I set out on a journey to understand how and why this diet worked for

<!-- chunk -->

### my patients. Along with its use in epilepsy, the ketogenic diet is also used in

<!-- chunk -->

### treating obesity and diabetes, and is even being pursued as a treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. At first, this was confusing and a bit overwhelming.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why would one treatment work for all of these disorders, even if only in

<!-- chunk -->

### some people? Ultimately, it was this question that opened the door to

<!-- chunk -->

### something much bigger than the inquiry I’d begun with. It forced me to

<!-- chunk -->

### uncover the connections between these different disorders and integrate this

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding with everything that I already knew as a neuroscientist and

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatrist. When I finally put all the pieces together, I realized that I had

<!-- chunk -->

### stumbled upon something beyond my wildest dreams. I had developed a

<!-- chunk -->

### unifying theory for the cause of all mental illnesses. I call it the theory of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is not a book about the ketogenic diet—or any diet at all. It’s also not

<!-- chunk -->

### solely concerned with serious mental illness; the scientific insights in this

<!-- chunk -->

### book apply to mild depression and anxiety as well. In fact, it may change

<!-- chunk -->

### the way you think about all human emotions and experiences. I am not

<!-- chunk -->

### offering a simple cure-all for mental illness, or advocating for any single

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment. The unexpected effectiveness of that particular treatment was

<!-- chunk -->

### only the first clue that started me on the path to a new way of understanding

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness. This book will share that understanding with you, taking you

<!-- chunk -->

### on a journey that I hope will transform the way you think about mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s a quick overview of what’s in store:

<!-- chunk -->

### •I’ll begin by reviewing where we are now in the mental health field:

<!-- chunk -->

### the problems and questions that plague us, and why they matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### •You’ll learn something that may seem shocking—mental disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### are not distinct entities. This includes diagnoses like depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, alcoholism, opioid addiction, eating

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. There is

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendous overlap in symptoms for different disorders, and many

<!-- chunk -->

### people are diagnosed with more than one. And even among disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### with symptoms that are very different, the underlying biological,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological, and social factors overlap significantly.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I’ll explore the surprising connections between mental disorders and

<!-- chunk -->

### some physical ones such as obesity, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes,

<!-- chunk -->

### pain disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. In order to truly

<!-- chunk -->

### understand what causes mental illness, these connections need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### understood as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### •This will all come together to reveal that mental disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders of the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### •In order to understand what this means, you’ll need to understand

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. It’s a lot more complicated than most people realize, but

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ll do my best to make it as simple as possible. Tiny things called

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are key. Metabolism and mitochondria can explain all

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I’ll discuss the differences between normal mental states and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. For example, we all experience anxiety, depression, and

<!-- chunk -->

### fear at different times in our lives. These experiences aren’t disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### —they are a normal part of being human. However, when these

<!-- chunk -->

### things happen at the wrong time or in an exaggerated way, they may

<!-- chunk -->

### cross the line from mental state to mental disorder. You’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### see that all mental states, even normal ones, relate to metabolism. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, “stress” is a mental state that affects metabolism—it takes a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic toll. If it occurs for prolonged periods of time or is

<!-- chunk -->

### extreme, it can lead to mental illness. But so can anything else that

<!-- chunk -->

### affects your metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I will share with you five broad mechanisms of action that can

<!-- chunk -->

### explain the clinical and neuroscientific observations we see in all

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I’ll show you that all the known contributing factors to mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, including things like genetics, inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, hormones, sleep, alcohol and drugs, love,

<!-- chunk -->

### heartbreak, meaning and purpose in life, trauma, and loneliness, can

<!-- chunk -->

### be tied directly to effects on metabolism and mitochondria. I’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrate how all these contributing factors affect metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### which then affects the function of cells, which can then result in

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### •You’ll learn that all current mental health treatments, including the

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological and social ones, likely work by affecting metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### •This new understanding of mental illness leads to new treatments,

<!-- chunk -->

### ones that offer the hope of long-term healing as opposed to just

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom reduction. They will sometimes be more difficult than just

<!-- chunk -->

### taking a pill, but they are well worth the effort. While more research

<!-- chunk -->

### will lead to additional new treatments, the exciting news is that many

<!-- chunk -->

### therapeutic options are available today.

<!-- chunk -->

### To be clear, I am not the first to suggest that metabolism and mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### are related to mental illness. In fact, I am building on decades of research.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without these other researchers and their pioneering work, this book

<!-- chunk -->

### wouldn’t exist. I’ll share many of their groundbreaking studies in the pages

<!-- chunk -->

### to come. However, for the first time, this book puts the pieces of the puzzle

<!-- chunk -->

### together to reveal one coherent theory. This theory integrates existing

<!-- chunk -->

### biological, psychological,

<!-- chunk -->

### and social research, and offers one unifying framework for explaining and

<!-- chunk -->

### treating mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain Energy not only provides long-elusive answers, it offers new

<!-- chunk -->

### solutions. I hope it will end the suffering and change the lives of millions of

<!-- chunk -->

### people throughout the world. If you or someone you love is affected by a

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness, it might just change your life, too.

# Part I

# Connecting the Dots


# What We’re Doing Isn’t Working

# MENTAL HEALTH TODAY

<!-- chunk -->

### he World Health Organization estimated that in 2017, almost

<!-- chunk -->

### million people on our planet suffered from mental health disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### This represents a bit over 10 percent of the world’s population, or one

<!-- chunk -->

### in every ten people. When substance use disorders are included in the

<!-- chunk -->

### count, the number climbs to 970 million people, or 13 percent of the global

<!-- chunk -->

### population. Anxiety disorders were the most common, affecting about 3.8

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of people around the world, followed by depression, affecting about

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.4 percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### Rates of these disorders are higher in the United States, with

<!-- chunk -->

### approximately 20 percent, or one in five people, diagnosed with a mental or

<!-- chunk -->

### substance use disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### These numbers give us a snapshot of the prevalence of mental disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### over a specific one-year period. But lifetime prevalence rates are much

<!-- chunk -->

### higher. In the United States, data now suggest that about 50 percent of the

<!-- chunk -->

### population will meet the criteria for a mental disorder at some point in their

<!-- chunk -->

### lives.


<!-- chunk -->

### Yes—half of all people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Estimating the rates of mental illness is difficult. People often deny their

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health problems to others or even to themselves. Having a mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness is stigmatized pretty much everywhere in the world. While societies

<!-- chunk -->

### have made important strides in recognizing things like depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety disorders as “real” illnesses, this progress is relatively recent, and it

<!-- chunk -->

### is far from universal. There are still people who see those suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### these disorders as simply “whiny” or “lazy.” On the other hand, while

<!-- chunk -->

### people with psychotic disorders are usually believed to have “real”

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses, they face a different kind of stigma. Many people are afraid of

<!-- chunk -->

### them or dismiss them as “crazy.” Then there are those with substance use

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders—not only do many see them as self-centered or morally weak, in

<!-- chunk -->

### some countries, such as some Middle Eastern ones, they are classified as

<!-- chunk -->

### criminals and can be incarcerated for using even alcohol. The effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### stigma can range from shame to outright discrimination, but stigma of any

<!-- chunk -->

### kind can motivate people to minimize or lie about symptoms. As such,

<!-- chunk -->

### prevalence statistics are most likely underestimates of the true scope of

<!-- chunk -->

### these disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### And as dire as these statistics are, the problem seems to be getting

<!-- chunk -->

### worse.

# A Growing Epidemic

<!-- chunk -->

### We have the best data for this in the United States, where researchers have

<!-- chunk -->

### been tracking mental health statistics for decades now. Rates of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness are on the rise. According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control),

<!-- chunk -->

### US adults over the age of eighteen had higher rates of mental illness in

<!-- chunk -->

### 2017 than in all but three of the years between 2008 and 2015. Of note, the

<!-- chunk -->

### youngest group (those aged eighteen through twenty-five) had the largest

<!-- chunk -->

### increase—rising 40 percent between 2008 and 2017.

<!-- chunk -->

### The rate of ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is rising in

<!-- chunk -->

### children and adolescents, increasing 41 percent in children four through

<!-- chunk -->

### seventeen between 2003 and 2012. This particular diagnosis and

<!-- chunk -->

### its reported upward trend attract considerable controversy. Some suggest

<!-- chunk -->

### that we are simply getting better at recognizing this disorder and providing

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment to children who need it to thrive. Others suggest that we are

<!-- chunk -->

### medicating normal behavior—that society and schools have come to expect

<!-- chunk -->

### too much from children, and that our expectations are unrealistic for what

<!-- chunk -->

### they are capable of at certain ages. Still others argue that the attention span

<!-- chunk -->

### of the American population has decreased across the board, likely due to

<!-- chunk -->

### increased time spent in front of screens, and this is being mistaken for

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD. Is the rate of this disorder truly increasing, or are these other factors

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for what we see in the data? We’ll further consider questions

<!-- chunk -->

### like this shortly. But ADHD isn’t the only diagnosis on the rise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression in children, adolescents, and young adults is increasing as

<!-- chunk -->

### well. From 2006 to 2017, rates of depression in the US increased by

<!-- chunk -->

### percent in children ages twelve to seventeen. In people ages eighteen to

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty-five, there was an increase of 49 percent. For adults over the age of

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty-five, the rate of depression supposedly stayed stable.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, much of this information is gleaned from surveys, and both

<!-- chunk -->

### the questions we ask and the way we ask them matters. Although surveys

<!-- chunk -->

### suggest that the rates of depression in adults are not increasing, many

<!-- chunk -->

### reports suggest that burnout is on the rise. Burnout is not an official

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric diagnosis in DSM-5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), but the World Health Organization

<!-- chunk -->

### recently added it to its list of mental disorders—the ICD-11 (International

<!-- chunk -->

### Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision). The criteria are similar to

<!-- chunk -->

### those for depression, but focus primarily on the stress of work and the work

<!-- chunk -->

### environment. There has been a lot of debate about whether burnout is

<!-- chunk -->

### simply a work-related form of depression, and for good reason: In one study

<!-- chunk -->

### looking at physician burnout, they found that those with mild burnout were

<!-- chunk -->

### three times more likely to meet criteria for major depression. Those with

<!-- chunk -->

### severe burnout were forty-six times more likely,


<!-- chunk -->

### suggesting little, if any,

<!-- chunk -->

### difference between these diagnostic labels. Like depression, burnout is also

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with much higher rates of suicide. Because burnout is not yet an

<!-- chunk -->

### official diagnosis in the DSM-5, US agencies don’t track its prevalence.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, a 2018 Gallup poll

<!-- chunk -->

### found that 23 percent of employees reported feeling burned out at work

<!-- chunk -->

### often or always, while another 44 percent felt burned out sometimes.


<!-- chunk -->

### These

<!-- chunk -->

### rates are much higher than those of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Suicide rates are increasing across most age groups. In 2016, nearly

<!-- chunk -->

### 45,000 people died by suicide in the United States alone. In general, for

<!-- chunk -->

### every person who dies by suicide, approximately thirty others attempt to

<!-- chunk -->

### kill themselves—putting the rate of suicide attempts at well over one

<!-- chunk -->

### million people per year. From 1999 to 2016, suicide rates increased in most

<!-- chunk -->

### US states, with twenty-five states seeing an increase of 30 percent or more.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another statistic, deaths of despair, tracks combined deaths in the United

<!-- chunk -->

### States from alcohol, drugs, and suicide. This statistic more than doubled

<!-- chunk -->

### between 1999 and 2017.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders, but the

<!-- chunk -->

### criteria for diagnosing them continue to evolve. This makes it difficult to

<!-- chunk -->

### assess changes over time. Some have argued that the rates have not changed

<!-- chunk -->

### in recent years.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, an annual household survey of approximately

<!-- chunk -->

### forty thousand US adults suggests that anxiety is increasing. Survey

<!-- chunk -->

### participants were asked, “How often did you feel nervous during the past

<!-- chunk -->

### days?” with five response options ranging from “all of the time” to “none of

<!-- chunk -->

### the time.” From 2008 to 2018, rates of anxiety increased by 30 percent. In

<!-- chunk -->

### the youngest group, ages eighteen to twenty-five, there was an 84 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### increase.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the more “common” diagnoses like depression and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### are thought of separately from mental disorders like schizophrenia—the

<!-- chunk -->

### term “serious mental illness” is often used by mental health professionals to

<!-- chunk -->

### talk about disorders that involve significant impairment and disability, such

<!-- chunk -->

### as those with psychotic symptoms. While this category includes some

<!-- chunk -->

### severe forms of depression and anxiety, it mostly refers to diagnoses like

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and the like. So what about these

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders? What’s happening with them? They’re increasing, too. Between

<!-- chunk -->

### 2008 and 2017, there was a 21 percent increase in serious mental disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### in those over the age of eighteen in the United States. For the younger

<!-- chunk -->

### group, those aged eighteen to twenty-five, the rate of serious mental illness

<!-- chunk -->

### doubled during that same period—less than a decade.


<!-- chunk -->

### The diagnosis of autism is increasing at an alarming rate.


<!-- chunk -->

### In 2000, autism

<!-- chunk -->

### affected about 1 in 150 children in the US; by 2014, it was about 1 in 59.

<!-- chunk -->

### The statistics for bipolar disorder are also concerning. From the mid-

<!-- chunk -->

### 1970s to 2000, the prevalence of bipolar disorder was somewhere in the

<!-- chunk -->

### range of 0.4 to 1.6 percent. By the early 2000s, it had increased to 4 to

<!-- chunk -->

### percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### In children and adolescents, this diagnosis was almost nonexistent

<!-- chunk -->

### prior to 1994, but it’s increasingly common now.

<!-- chunk -->

### These statistics are difficult to comprehend. Diagnoses like autism and

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder aren’t supposed to increase exponentially over such a short

<!-- chunk -->

### period of time. While anxiety and depression can be situational, these other

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders are generally regarded as firmly “biological,” and many

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers believe they are determined in large part by genetics. Clearly,

<!-- chunk -->

### the human species didn’t have an epidemic of genetic mutations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers, clinicians, and society at large are struggling to understand

<!-- chunk -->

### what to make of the sharp increase in mental illness. While there is no

<!-- chunk -->

### consensus explanation, plenty of people have theories—and generally

<!-- chunk -->

### speaking, these theories can be divided into two categories.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first category relies on the belief that the statistics are wrong, or

<!-- chunk -->

### that they don’t mean what we think they do. Many people think it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### impossible that the rates of mental disorders could increase so rapidly; they

<!-- chunk -->

### believe that these statistics are the result of doctors and/or patients seeing

<!-- chunk -->

### “disorders” that are not there. Here are three of the most prominent theories

<!-- chunk -->

### in this category:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.It’s the pharmaceutical companies! They are looking to sell pills to

<!-- chunk -->

### as many people as possible, and to sell pills, they have to convince

<!-- chunk -->

### both doctors and the public that they need them. They spend billions

<!-- chunk -->

### of dollars every year on marketing, sending samples to doctors to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep the name of their product top of mind. They run television ads

<!-- chunk -->

### that ask if the viewer has any of a variety of vague symptoms, like

<!-- chunk -->

### “decreased enjoyment.” If you do, you are instructed to “talk to your

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor and see if ‘drug X’ is right for you.” These types of

<!-- chunk -->

### advertisements feed into people’s tendencies to be hypochondriacs.

<!-- chunk -->

### These worried people then go to doctors and emerge with a new

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis, and of course, the pills to treat it.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.It’s laziness! People today don’t want to work at things. They also

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t want to experience any discomfort or think that they should

<!-- chunk -->

### have to. They increasingly categorize run-of-the-mill human

<!-- chunk -->

### emotions or experiences as “symptoms.” They flock to therapists to

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve these “symptoms.” Sometimes, they even go to the doctor to

<!-- chunk -->

### complain about them. People want quick and easy fixes; doctors are

<!-- chunk -->

### overworked and busy, and the easiest thing for them to do is write a

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.It’s this new generation of kids! Given that the rates are increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### most dramatically in children and young adults, it is clear that the

<!-- chunk -->

### blame lies with them—or their parents. Parents have pampered and

<!-- chunk -->

### spoiled this younger generation—catering to their every whim. These

<!-- chunk -->

### children and young adults have never been disciplined and also don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### have much willpower or perseverance. They get easily frustrated and

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelmed. When their parents are no longer there to fix things, or

<!-- chunk -->

### when anyone tells them “no,” they go into a crisis. These meltdowns

<!-- chunk -->

### get them diagnosed with some mental disorder. Or, unable to handle

<!-- chunk -->

### life in the real world, they look for a “mental illness” to blame.

<!-- chunk -->

### As appealing as these types of theories may be, they are likely not the

<!-- chunk -->

### answers. If you do not suffer from a mental health issue yourself, or have a

<!-- chunk -->

### child who does, or have daily contact with patients who do, it’s easy to

<!-- chunk -->

### assume that these people are simply whiners and complainers, and that

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors, patients, and parents are looking for quick fixes. It’s easy to

<!-- chunk -->

### dismiss a problem when that problem is far removed from you. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### when you are confronted with the real people behind these statistics and

<!-- chunk -->

### witness their suffering, these blanket assumptions become impossible to

<!-- chunk -->

### sustain. When someone you know to be a “good parent” has a

<!-- chunk -->

### seven-year-old who suffers from fits of rage, who is not sleeping, who is

<!-- chunk -->

### threatening to kill himself or other people, the problem begins to look like a

<!-- chunk -->

### real one. These behaviors are not normal. When a woman has such severe

<!-- chunk -->

### panic attacks that she stops leaving the house, this is not normal. When a

<!-- chunk -->

### person is so depressed that they sometimes cannot get out of bed in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning, this is not normal.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, the second category of theories about the increasing rates of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders accepts the statistics as real. These are people who believe that

<!-- chunk -->

### these illnesses are truly on the rise. They offer a variety of perspectives and

<!-- chunk -->

### possible explanations:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.It’s a good thing! These statistics are positive—they reflect a

<!-- chunk -->

### broader understanding of mental disorders and more awareness of

<!-- chunk -->

### how to identify them. There are many programs in schools and work

<!-- chunk -->

### environments on recognizing the symptoms of mental and substance

<!-- chunk -->

### use disorders. There are public service campaigns focused on suicide

<!-- chunk -->

### prevention. Celebrities are speaking out about their own mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health struggles, and there is more coverage of mental health in the

<!-- chunk -->

### media that is explicitly aimed at raising awareness and reducing

<!-- chunk -->

### stigma. People are increasingly getting the help they need, being

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed, and treated.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.It’s society! We have become increasingly dependent on technology

<!-- chunk -->

### and screens. As we sit and look at our phones, computers, or

<!-- chunk -->

### televisions, we have become both more sedentary and more isolated.

<!-- chunk -->

### We interact with each other less in “real life,” connecting through

<!-- chunk -->

### social media instead of spending time together or talking on the

<!-- chunk -->

### phone. People only post the parts of their lives that “look good,” so

<!-- chunk -->

### social media fosters unrealistic expectations and shame, not real

<!-- chunk -->

### connection. The pace of life is faster, too. Everyone is busy and over-

<!-- chunk -->

### scheduled—even children. Families aren’t having dinner together

<!-- chunk -->

### like they did in “the old days.” No wonder people feel burned out.

<!-- chunk -->

### No wonder so many people are developing mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s toxins, chemicals, and fake food! It is not just the behavior of

<!-- chunk -->

### society that has changed, it is the physical world we live in. We are

<!-- chunk -->

### exposing ourselves to toxins every day. The foods we eat are filled

<!-- chunk -->

### with artificial ingredients. New chemicals are everywhere—on our

<!-- chunk -->

### lawns, in our water supply, in personal hygiene products that we use

<!-- chunk -->

### morning and night. We create and surround ourselves with

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds we’d never encounter in nature, the effects of which—

<!-- chunk -->

### especially in combination with so many other compounds—we do

<!-- chunk -->

### not fully understand. These are leading to increases in all sorts of

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses, including cancer, obesity, and mental disorders, too, even if

<!-- chunk -->

### we don’t yet know precisely how.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many more of these “second category” theories for the rise of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health problems, but these are some of the most commonly

<!-- chunk -->

### discussed ones. None of these three are far-fetched. They might well play a

<!-- chunk -->

### role with at least some people, or at least some of the time. As I will explain

<!-- chunk -->

### later in this book, some of them almost certainly do.

<!-- chunk -->

### But as for number one on the list above—rationalizing the statistics as

<!-- chunk -->

### simply the result of improved recognition and diagnosis—the evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### shows that it isn’t just recognition that is increasing. The surveys comparing

<!-- chunk -->

### year-after-year data include samples of the entire population, regardless of

<!-- chunk -->

### whether people get diagnosed or not. These disorders are truly on the rise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Perhaps the most important point to note is that the rates of very

<!-- chunk -->

### different mental disorders—autism, bipolar disorder, depression, and

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD, to name a few—are all increasing at the same time. Why would

<!-- chunk -->

### that be? We think of bipolar disorder, ADHD, and depression as very

<!-- chunk -->

### distinct from one another, with distinct contributing causes. If these

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders are genetic, what happened to our genes? Is there a toxin causing

<!-- chunk -->

### numerous mutations? If the culprit is the stress of our fast-paced modern

<!-- chunk -->

### society, why are all of the disorders increasing? Wouldn’t more stress

<!-- chunk -->

### simply lead to more depression and anxiety? Certainly, stress doesn’t cause

<!-- chunk -->

### autism and bipolar disorder. Or does it? These statistics raise more

<!-- chunk -->

### questions than they answer.

<!-- chunk -->

### To add insult to injury, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken an additional

<!-- chunk -->

### toll. In June 2020, an estimated 40 percent of all US adults reported

<!-- chunk -->

### struggling with mental health or substance use issues. Eleven percent of the

<!-- chunk -->

### adults surveyed said they had considered suicide in the past thirty days.


# The Price We Pay

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental disorders are costly to society. The financial toll worldwide was

<!-- chunk -->

### $2.5 trillion in 2010 and is expected to reach $6 trillion by 2030.


<!-- chunk -->

### These

<!-- chunk -->

### figures include the costs of direct mental healthcare services

<!-- chunk -->

### (hospitalizations, doctor and therapist visits) and prescription medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there are also other financial costs that are more difficult to measure,

<!-- chunk -->

### including lost productivity due to employees becoming less focused or

<!-- chunk -->

### taking sick leave. These losses affect employers and employees, societies

<!-- chunk -->

### and individual sufferers. Depression is now the diagnosis that tops the list

<!-- chunk -->

### of disabling illnesses—above all other illnesses, including cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, cancer, and infections. Mental and substance use disorders are the

<!-- chunk -->

### leading cause of “years lost to disability” and “overall disease burden” in

<!-- chunk -->

### the US.


<!-- chunk -->

### Much more important than the financial costs of mental disorders is the

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering they cause to individuals and their families. They cause untold

<!-- chunk -->

### misery and despair. Mental illnesses can ruin people’s lives. They may lead

<!-- chunk -->

### to social isolation, disrupt school and career plans, and limit what people

<!-- chunk -->

### can expect for themselves in heartbreaking ways. The suffering almost

<!-- chunk -->

### always extends beyond the person with the disorder. Family life can be

<!-- chunk -->

### thrown into chaos. Divorce is a common consequence. Those closest to the

<!-- chunk -->

### sufferer can themselves develop mental disorders like anxiety or PTSD

<!-- chunk -->

### (posttraumatic stress disorder); they can simply burn out and abandon their

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering friend or family member to preserve their own health. At least half

<!-- chunk -->

### of the people in homeless shelters suffer from mental or substance use


<!-- chunk -->

### The same is true of prisons.


<!-- chunk -->

### Mental disorders can contribute

<!-- chunk -->

### to violence—not just the school shooters who make it into the headlines,

<!-- chunk -->

### but also domestic

<!-- chunk -->

### violence. Mental disorders can result in such extreme hopelessness that

<!-- chunk -->

### people take their own lives.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the majority of people, however, mental disorders don’t show

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves in dramatic and easily visible ways. Instead, people suffer alone

<!-- chunk -->

### in silence. They are ashamed. They don’t know what to do about their

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. Oftentimes, they don’t even know they have an illness. They

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t think of their symptoms as “symptoms”; they think their suffering is

<!-- chunk -->

### just a natural part of existence. They might believe that they are weak or

<!-- chunk -->

### inferior to others. They may think that they just need to make the most of

<!-- chunk -->

### the life they were given. They experience their distress, their symptoms, as

<!-- chunk -->

### an integral part of themselves or their life experiences.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, imagine a woman we’ll call Mary. Her father was an

<!-- chunk -->

### alcoholic and verbally and physically abusive. He found fault with

<!-- chunk -->

### seemingly everything that she did, and she grew to believe that she was

<!-- chunk -->

### stupid and had few redeeming qualities. She didn’t talk to people about her

<!-- chunk -->

### father’s rages; she assumed this would only cause more trouble and incite

<!-- chunk -->

### further punishment from him. By high school, she was depressed, isolated,

<!-- chunk -->

### and saw little hope for her future. This continued into her adulthood. Mary

<!-- chunk -->

### had trouble sleeping, had flashbacks of her father yelling at her, and startled

<!-- chunk -->

### easily at loud noises. It did not occur to her that any of this might constitute

<!-- chunk -->

### a “disorder,” much less be treatable. I see patients like Mary who have

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered like this for years before something brings them to treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many, many people like Mary never seek treatment at all.

# What About Treatment?

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatment for mental disorders is vitally important. It can reduce suffering.

<!-- chunk -->

### It can prevent disability. It can restore people’s dreams and potential.

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatment can save lives. In fact, it does. Many people benefit

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendously from present-day mental health treatments. Patients overcome

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction, find relief from psychotic episodes, learn to manage anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### recover from

<!-- chunk -->

### eating disorders—these victories are real and significant. The treatments we

<!-- chunk -->

### have work. Unfortunately, they just don’t work all the time or for everyone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at a success story first.

<!-- chunk -->

### John was a thirty-six-year-old engineer, married with two young

<!-- chunk -->

### children. Life had been pretty good for him . . . until he discovered his wife

<!-- chunk -->

### was having an affair. John wanted to save his marriage, but his wife wanted

<!-- chunk -->

### a different life, and she had decided to leave him. John was devastated and

<!-- chunk -->

### became severely depressed. He was unable to sleep more than two hours at

<!-- chunk -->

### a time. He couldn’t stop obsessing about how his life was now ruined. He

<!-- chunk -->

### couldn’t focus at work. He felt the only solution was to get his wife to

<!-- chunk -->

### return, but she wasn’t interested. He was tormented with guilt about all the

<!-- chunk -->

### ways he thought he’d failed as a husband, as a father, as a person. This went

<!-- chunk -->

### on for three months and showed no signs of improving—if anything, it was

<!-- chunk -->

### getting worse. Finally, John’s family encouraged him to see a psychiatrist.

<!-- chunk -->

### He came away with a prescription for an antidepressant and a sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### medication, and he started weekly psychotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within days, John was getting more sleep. This helped him to feel less

<!-- chunk -->

### disoriented and overwhelmed, but he was still distraught. Within a month,

<!-- chunk -->

### however, things started to turn around. His mood began to improve. He was

<!-- chunk -->

### able to stop the sleep medication and sleep normally on his own. He was

<!-- chunk -->

### managing to focus less on tortured ruminations and more on things that he

<!-- chunk -->

### could control. He focused on projects at work and around the house, and he

<!-- chunk -->

### made the decision to get into better shape. He started spending more quality

<!-- chunk -->

### time with his two children. He took the steps he’d been avoiding to finalize

<!-- chunk -->

### the divorce. After a few months, he was able to stop psychotherapy. After a

<!-- chunk -->

### year, he tapered off the antidepressant and continued to feel well. He started

<!-- chunk -->

### dating again.

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s story demonstrates the success of modern psychiatry. The

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of medications and psychotherapy alleviated his depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and anxiety and helped him cope with an extraordinarily stressful time in

<!-- chunk -->

### his life. John’s was not the only suffering lessened, either. Divorce is

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult for children—in fact, it increases their risk of experiencing mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health

<!-- chunk -->

### challenges of their own. Having a parent with severe depression also

<!-- chunk -->

### increases this risk. Treatment allowed John to be a better, more engaged

<!-- chunk -->

### father. So, helping John feel better was also beneficial to his children.

<!-- chunk -->

### John’s workplace benefited, too. While depressed, John still showed up at

<!-- chunk -->

### work every day, but he wasn’t able to focus, and he got less done.

<!-- chunk -->

### Successful treatment helped John be a more productive employee.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are countless stories like John’s, and it is easy to understand why

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers and clinicians in the mental health field like to tell them. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### important to highlight that treatments can work. It’s important to encourage

<!-- chunk -->

### people to seek help, to let them know their suffering can end. And

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals in any field want to focus on their successes. They don’t tend

<!-- chunk -->

### to advertise what’s not working. Unfortunately, in the mental health field,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is a lot that isn’t working. Not everyone gets a positive outcome like

<!-- chunk -->

### John. In fact, most don’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders in the United States. In 2020, an estimated 21 million adults

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced at least one depressive episode, representing 8.4 percent of all

<!-- chunk -->

### US adults. About 66 percent of them received some form of treatment.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, what happens to all of these people who get treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### depression? Do they get better—and most importantly, stay better—over

<!-- chunk -->

### the long run?

<!-- chunk -->

### One study tried to answer this by recruiting a group of people seeking

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for major depression from five different academic medical centers

<!-- chunk -->

### and following them for twelve years.


<!-- chunk -->

### The study included 431 people, and

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers assessed their symptoms of depression on a weekly basis. What

<!-- chunk -->

### they found was that even with treatment, 90 percent had persistent

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. On average, over the twelve-year period, the people in the study

<!-- chunk -->

### had symptoms of depression 59 percent of the time. Their symptoms would

<!-- chunk -->

### fluctuate, sometimes going away but then coming back, even with

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment, even if they took medications every day. In other words,

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of the people were not cured of their depression. They either

<!-- chunk -->

### continued to have low-grade lingering symptoms or they would come in

<!-- chunk -->

### and out of bouts of major depression. Depression was found to be a chronic,

<!-- chunk -->

### but episodic, illness. These researchers found that if people had only one

<!-- chunk -->

### episode of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, like John, the chances of a full and lasting recovery were

<!-- chunk -->

### greater. However, there weren’t many of those people.

<!-- chunk -->

### This study is not an outlier; it is a reflection of what anyone who has

<!-- chunk -->

### worked in the mental health field for a number of years already knows to be

<!-- chunk -->

### the case. Almost two-thirds of depressed patients don’t experience

<!-- chunk -->

### remission—meaning get all the way better, even temporarily—with the first

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment they are offered.


<!-- chunk -->

### As the statistics suggest, many people go on to

<!-- chunk -->

### suffer for years, despite trying treatment after treatment. It’s not just a

<!-- chunk -->

### failure of medications, either. Many people try numerous treatments—

<!-- chunk -->

### medications, psychotherapy, group therapy, meditation, positive thinking,

<!-- chunk -->

### stress management, and more. Some even try transcranial magnetic

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation (TMS) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, also known as

<!-- chunk -->

### “shock therapy”). People for whom no treatment seems to be very

<!-- chunk -->

### successful are said to suffer from “treatment-resistant depression,” though

<!-- chunk -->

### there are many more people who do find some relief, but not in a complete

<!-- chunk -->

### or durable way. The fact that depression is the leading cause of disability in

<!-- chunk -->

### the world clearly speaks to the lack of effectiveness of our current

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments. What are we missing? Why can’t we get most people with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression all the way better and keep them better?

<!-- chunk -->

### You may be wondering about the outlook for mental disorders other

<!-- chunk -->

### than depression. Sadly, the statistics for many other disorders are even

<!-- chunk -->

### worse. I won’t go through the data for every condition, but disorders like

<!-- chunk -->

### OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), autism, bipolar disorder, and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia are all at least as bad as depression in terms of both treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### success and the chronic nature of their afflictions.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many of these patients

<!-- chunk -->

### are told that they have lifelong disorders and that they will need to lower

<!-- chunk -->

### their expectations about what they will be able to achieve in life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Understandably, many patients are frustrated by the ineffectiveness of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health treatment. They hear stories like John’s and assume they

<!-- chunk -->

### should be cured like he was. They often come to believe that the

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals treating them are incompetent, or that they haven’t gotten the

<!-- chunk -->

### correct diagnosis, or that they just haven’t found the right pill yet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, these usually aren’t the reasons they aren’t getting better. For

<!-- chunk -->

### most people, it’s simply because our treatments don’t work all that well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some professionals in the mental health field won’t like this assessment or

<!-- chunk -->

### approve of me sharing it this way. They may fear that pessimism about

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment will deter people from seeking help. This is a legitimate concern.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is important that those suffering from mental illness reach out for support

<!-- chunk -->

### from professionals—sometimes this can be enough to keep someone alive

<!-- chunk -->

### through a suicidal crisis. Nonetheless, the data I’ve presented is accurate; to

<!-- chunk -->

### claim that mental health treatment works for everyone (or even most

<!-- chunk -->

### people), and works completely, is misleading at best. A bigger concern is

<!-- chunk -->

### that these types of claims can serve to further shame and stigmatize those

<!-- chunk -->

### with mental disorders. If people are told that our treatments work, and then

<!-- chunk -->

### those people don’t get better, some will blame the treatment or

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals, but others will blame themselves. And it isn’t just the

<!-- chunk -->

### patients: If we make these kinds of claims to families, other clinicians, and

<!-- chunk -->

### society at large, what happens when patients don’t get better? Do we say

<!-- chunk -->

### that the patient must have a “treatment-resistant” version of the disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### implying that they have a more severe form of mental illness (which may

<!-- chunk -->

### very well not be true) and possibly adding to the stigma they suffer? Or do

<!-- chunk -->

### we suggest that it is the patient’s fault? Is the person not trying hard enough

<!-- chunk -->

### in therapy? Does the person somehow “want” to be sick? Unfortunately,

<!-- chunk -->

### these kinds of implications are all too common from clinicians, family

<!-- chunk -->

### members, friends, and others. And so we are back where we began, with the

<!-- chunk -->

### choice to come clean and say that for most disorders, treatments don’t work

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term for the majority of people. This brings with it the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### discouraging those who need it from seeking treatment in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Given everything I’ve outlined in this chapter—that these disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### common and becoming more common, that they are an enormous burden

<!-- chunk -->

### on society both in terms of economic impact and human suffering, and that

<!-- chunk -->

### our treatments have proved unequal to the task of relieving that burden—it

<!-- chunk -->

### seems clear that mental illness is a global health emergency. We have

<!-- chunk -->

### poured money into research in the hope of shedding light on the problem

<!-- chunk -->

### and uncovering new solutions. In 2019, the National Institutes of Health

<!-- chunk -->

### (NIH)

<!-- chunk -->

### spent $3.2 billion on mental health research. What do we have to show for

<!-- chunk -->

### the research that has been done?

<!-- chunk -->

### This is what Dr. Tom Insel, the former director of the National Institute

<!-- chunk -->

### of Mental Health (NIMH), had to say in 2017 after leaving the NIMH:

<!-- chunk -->

## I spent thirteen years at NIMH really pushing on the

<!-- chunk -->

## neuroscience and genetics of mental disorders, and when I

<!-- chunk -->

## look back on that I realize that while I think I succeeded at

<!-- chunk -->

## getting lots of really cool papers published by cool scientists

<!-- chunk -->

## at fairly large costs—I think $20 billion—I don’t think we

<!-- chunk -->

## moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing

<!-- chunk -->

## hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of

<!-- chunk -->

## people who have mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### 19

<!-- chunk -->

### This was brave of Insel to acknowledge. Those in the mental health field

<!-- chunk -->

### know it to be true. So, again, what are we missing?

<!-- chunk -->

### The fact is, in order to make real progress, we have to be able to answer

<!-- chunk -->

### the question: “What causes mental illness?” And up until now, we have

<!-- chunk -->

### failed.


# What Causes Mental Illness and Why

# Does It Matter?

<!-- chunk -->

### nsanity, madness, anxiety, irrational fear, unrelenting depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction, suicide: Mental illness has been described in every human

<!-- chunk -->

### culture on Earth, stretching back from the present to antiquity. While we

<!-- chunk -->

### have seen that it is on the rise, it is far from a new affliction. And yet the

<!-- chunk -->

### question of what causes it continues to perplex us. Ancient scholars,

<!-- chunk -->

### philosophers, and poets, along with modern-day neuroscientists, physicians,

<!-- chunk -->

### and psychologists, have studied this question relentlessly, and come up with

<!-- chunk -->

### no definitive answer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many theories have been proposed over the past few millennia. In

<!-- chunk -->

### ancient times, mental illnesses were largely thought to be the result of

<!-- chunk -->

### supernatural forces. Punishment from God was a common belief. Demonic

<!-- chunk -->

### possession also had its heyday, with exorcism being the treatment of choice.

<!-- chunk -->

### While these kinds of views have persisted and resurfaced throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### history, a more scientific attitude emerged almost as soon as illness in

<!-- chunk -->

### general began to be looked at in a natural rather than supernatural light, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the conception

<!-- chunk -->

### of mental illness as a medical disorder was born. The ancient Greek

<!-- chunk -->

### physician Hippocrates was among those who took mental illnesses

<!-- chunk -->

### seriously; he postulated that they might be due to an imbalance of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body’s four vital fluids, or “humors.” An excess of one of these, black bile,

<!-- chunk -->

### was thought to cause depression—or melancholia; in fact the word

<!-- chunk -->

### “melancholy” comes from the Greek for “black bile.” (Interestingly, bodily

<!-- chunk -->

### substances—particularly feces, as it relates to the gut microbiome—are

<!-- chunk -->

### making a comeback in the theory of mental illness. More on that later.) Just

<!-- chunk -->

### as the birth of medicine transformed the way people thought of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, so, naturally, did the development of the field of psychology.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sigmund Freud famously theorized that mental disorders were due to

<!-- chunk -->

### unconscious desires or conflicts, and he framed the working of the mind in

<!-- chunk -->

### terms of nonphysical entities or forces—the id, the ego, and the superego.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other psychological theories have since been developed, many attempting

<!-- chunk -->

### to explain mental illness more “scientifically” based upon what we know

<!-- chunk -->

### about behavior and neuroscience. Modern cognitive or behavioral theories,

<!-- chunk -->

### for instance, might view an anxiety disorder as the result of internalized

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns of thought, or advocate changing certain behaviors as a way to

<!-- chunk -->

### change mental experiences. While psychological theories are still used in

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment today, most clinicians and researchers do not believe they can

<!-- chunk -->

### explain all mental disorders. From the mid-nineteenth century to the present

<!-- chunk -->

### day, there has been increasing evidence that mental illnesses have at least

<!-- chunk -->

### some biological components or influences. Chemical imbalances, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### changes, hormones, inflammation, and immune system problems are all

<!-- chunk -->

### believed to have possible roles in causing mental illness. Nonetheless, some

<!-- chunk -->

### authorities in the field feel that a physical model of mental states is too

<!-- chunk -->

### “reductionistic.” They say it reduces the complexity of human behavior,

<!-- chunk -->

### emotion, and experience to chemistry or biology, and that human

<!-- chunk -->

### experience cannot be explained by our mere molecules.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1977, Dr. George Engel, an internist and psychiatrist, developed a

<!-- chunk -->

### working model of what causes mental illness that is still widely used today.

<!-- chunk -->

### He called it the biopsychosocial model.


<!-- chunk -->

### It asserts that there are (1)

<!-- chunk -->

### biological factors, including genes and hormones; (2) psychological factors,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as

<!-- chunk -->

### upbringing and rigid beliefs; and (3) social factors, like poverty or a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### friends, that all come together for any given individual to produce a mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness. Another popular model is the diathesis–stress model. “Diathesis”

<!-- chunk -->

### means a biological predisposition to becoming ill, something like genetics

<!-- chunk -->

### or a hormonal imbalance. The stress in this model can be anything in the

<!-- chunk -->

### environment, such as getting fired from a job, drug use, or even an

<!-- chunk -->

### infection, that then pushes the already predisposed person to actually

<!-- chunk -->

### become ill. This model assumes that most people who develop mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders were likely to do so at some point or another in their lives—they

<!-- chunk -->

### were just waiting to be triggered. Both of these models present a picture of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness that attempts to account for many different factors all

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing to the development of a mental disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because, in fact, we have identified many factors that make people

<!-- chunk -->

### more likely to develop various mental disorders. And today, when we think

<!-- chunk -->

### about what causes mental illness, we often think in terms of these risk

<!-- chunk -->

### factors. They include things like stress, drug and alcohol use, hormonal

<!-- chunk -->

### issues, and a family history of mental illness, among others. The problem is

<!-- chunk -->

### that although we know of many such risk factors, not one of them is present

<!-- chunk -->

### in everyone with a specific disorder, and not one of them is sufficient, in

<!-- chunk -->

### and of itself, to cause any specific disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### An obvious example is PTSD. This is the disorder that causes people to

<!-- chunk -->

### experience fear, flashbacks, excessive anxiety, and feelings of numbness for

<!-- chunk -->

### months or years after living through a traumatic event. By definition,

<!-- chunk -->

### anyone with PTSD must have been exposed to a traumatic event, but only

<!-- chunk -->

### about 15 percent of people who experience such trauma end up developing

<!-- chunk -->

### PTSD. Even when two people experience the same traumatic event, one

<!-- chunk -->

### person can end up with severe PTSD while the other is spared entirely. In

<!-- chunk -->

### other words, trauma, on its own, does not “cause” PTSD. OK, you say,

<!-- chunk -->

### that’s because it results from a combination of risk factors. Unfortunately,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is no combination of risk factors “guaranteed” to result in PTSD,

<!-- chunk -->

### either. And so it goes with almost every other mental disorder. Sometimes,

<!-- chunk -->

### it seems easy to understand why someone develops mental illness. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, a woman who had a horrible, abusive childhood, who has a

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### and who was just left by her husband of ten years for another woman might

<!-- chunk -->

### develop clinical depression. Most people can understand why she might be

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed because she has many risk factors for developing clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. However, there are other people for whom mental illness seems

<!-- chunk -->

### to come from out of the blue for no reason at all.

# Decoding Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s take a look at one of the most clearly defined and understood mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders—major depression. Everyone gets depressed, but not everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### gets major depression. People with major depression feel sad or depressed

<!-- chunk -->

### most of the time, and they may experience fatigue, problems concentrating,

<!-- chunk -->

### and disrupted sleep. This disorder can rob people of all ability to experience

<!-- chunk -->

### pleasure and enjoyment from life, and it may leave them with

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelming feelings of hopelessness and even thoughts of suicide. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are nine symptoms in all, and to be diagnosed with major depression, a

<!-- chunk -->

### person must experience at least five of them for at least two weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many clearly established risk factors for the development of

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression. They include genetics or a family history of depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, the death of a loved one, the breakup of a relationship, conflict at

<!-- chunk -->

### work or school, and physical and sexual abuse. Various hormonal problems

<!-- chunk -->

### also make the list, including low thyroid hormone, high levels of cortisol,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the fluctuations in women’s hormones that can contribute to the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression in the postpartum period or around the time of menstruation. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, just being a woman doubles the risk of depression compared to being a

<!-- chunk -->

### man. Excessive drug or alcohol use is a risk factor, and even some less

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious prescription medications, like certain antibiotics or blood pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### medications, can increase risk as well. Then there are social issues, like

<!-- chunk -->

### being bullied or teased, having no friends, or simply feeling lonely most of

<!-- chunk -->

### the time. Poverty, malnutrition, and unsafe living environments also

<!-- chunk -->

### increase risk. Sleep disturbance is a big one: either too much or too little

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep puts people at risk for depression. Many physical illnesses make the

<!-- chunk -->

### list of risk

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic pain, diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Cancer is

<!-- chunk -->

### another risk factor—but not necessarily the way you might think. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### people would be stressed by a diagnosis of cancer and assume it’s only

<!-- chunk -->

### natural that such a devastating diagnosis might make someone depressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### That does happen for some people. However, some patients get clinically

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed before they even know they have cancer. This is a common

<!-- chunk -->

### occurrence with pancreatic cancer in particular—people find themselves

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed for seemingly no good reason, and then a few months later are

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Virtually all neurological disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with higher rates of depression, including strokes, multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. And

<!-- chunk -->

### interestingly, every other psychiatric disorder puts people at much higher

<!-- chunk -->

### risk for also developing major depression on top of their already existing


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s . . . a lot of risk factors. And they vary widely. Not just in the

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of things they are—biological, psychological, and social—but in how

<!-- chunk -->

### big of a role they are believed to play. For instance, while being a woman is

<!-- chunk -->

### a risk factor for major depression, no one would say that being a woman

<!-- chunk -->

### causes major depression. But there are certain factors that contribute more

<!-- chunk -->

### directly, and in fact many competing theories hold one factor or another to

<!-- chunk -->

### be the root cause of the disorder. Unlike those who subscribe to the

<!-- chunk -->

### biopsychosocial model, some professionals believe that major depression

<!-- chunk -->

### has a purely genetic, purely biological, or purely psychological origin—the

<!-- chunk -->

### rest of the risk factors are just window dressing.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most widely known of these single-cause theories is the

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical imbalance theory of depression—and in fact, of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### This theory suggests an imbalance in brain chemicals called

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters is the cause of all mental illness. Neurotransmitters are

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals that relay signals between brain cells. For depression, the most

<!-- chunk -->

### popular belief is that levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin are too low;

<!-- chunk -->

### thus, medications that increase serotonin levels will treat depression. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### of the most commonly prescribed medications for depression belong to a

<!-- chunk -->

### class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or

<!-- chunk -->

### SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil are in this category). They often do help

<!-- chunk -->

### resolve the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### of depression, which supports the theory that maybe a chemical imbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### is the cause. Other classes of medications that affect different

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter systems can also alleviate depression, so maybe it’s not

<!-- chunk -->

### just serotonin—maybe it’s various neurotransmitters in different people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nonetheless, many psychiatrists and researchers believe that at its root,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression always boils down to a chemical imbalance.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, there are many questions raised by this theory:

<!-- chunk -->

### •What causes the chemical imbalance in the first place?

<!-- chunk -->

### •If people are born with this chemical imbalance, why aren’t they

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed all the time, starting from birth?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Why do medications like SSRIs take weeks or months to work? We

<!-- chunk -->

### know they change neurotransmitter levels within hours, so why don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### they work immediately?

<!-- chunk -->

### •If it’s a fixed chemical imbalance, why do the symptoms wax and

<!-- chunk -->

### wane, even over short periods of time? Put another way, why do

<!-- chunk -->

### people have good days and bad days, even when taking medications

<!-- chunk -->

### consistently?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Why do the medications stop working in so many people? Why

<!-- chunk -->

### would the imbalance change, and if it does change, what makes it

<!-- chunk -->

### change?

<!-- chunk -->

### These questions are begging for answers, not just in relation to the

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis of depression, but for all psychiatric diagnoses. Unfortunately, the

<!-- chunk -->

### chemical imbalance theory doesn’t provide answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another widely known theory for the cause of major depression is the

<!-- chunk -->

### learned helplessness theory. In a nutshell, it holds that when people are

<!-- chunk -->

### unable to change adverse circumstances in their lives, they “learn” that they

<!-- chunk -->

### are helpless. This can apply to something like not being able to find a

<!-- chunk -->

### romantic relationship despite numerous attempts, or more direly, an abused

<!-- chunk -->

### child trying to get his father to stop hitting him. In either case,

<!-- chunk -->

### these people begin to feel powerless, and then they get depressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eventually they stop trying to do much at all. Why bother? Some experts

<!-- chunk -->

### assert that the cause of these people’s depression is their psychology. They

<!-- chunk -->

### have learned, and believe, that they are helpless. Obviously, getting the

<!-- chunk -->

### abused child out of that environment is of paramount importance. But even

<!-- chunk -->

### years later, that boy may still be depressed. The treatment is often based on

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of talk therapy that focuses on

<!-- chunk -->

### identifying and changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This therapy is

<!-- chunk -->

### based on the belief that when people are clinically depressed, it is likely

<!-- chunk -->

### because of thoughts that are based not so much on the reality of their

<!-- chunk -->

### current situation as on the helpless mindset developed in the past. The goal

<!-- chunk -->

### is to empower patients to challenge these thoughts and replace them with

<!-- chunk -->

### ones not so dire and hopeless. This will help them feel better and make

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in their lives, which will make them feel less helpless still, and this

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle will reinforce itself. This treatment works, at least for some people,

<!-- chunk -->

### which again supports the theory that this kind of problem might be a cause

<!-- chunk -->

### of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other theories about specific factors believed to be the

<!-- chunk -->

### cause of major depression—biological, psychological, and social. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### have led to the development of specific treatments and interventions that

<!-- chunk -->

### work with real people, at least some of the time. In fact, the theories

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves are often shaped by treatments that are effective for depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### using the logic that if a treatment works, even in some people, then it must

<!-- chunk -->

### be correcting a problem that was causing the illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medications used to treat major depression include those specifically

<!-- chunk -->

### known as “antidepressants,” which are commonly sorted into five different

<!-- chunk -->

### classes. These classes act on different neurotransmitters and receptors,

<!-- chunk -->

### including ones for serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants aren’t the only medications used to treat major depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others include anxiety medications, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants, antiepileptic medications, hormones, vitamins, and a wide

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of supplements, such as St. John’s wort. These all work in very

<!-- chunk -->

### different ways,

<!-- chunk -->

### and yet all are used routinely in treating depression, and all have been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to work for at least some people, some of the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychotherapy to treat depression also comes in many varieties. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### focus on relationships, others on thoughts and feelings, and others on

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors; some focus solely on changes in the present, and others on

<!-- chunk -->

### revisiting your past or childhood. Different types of psychotherapy can be

<!-- chunk -->

### very different from each other, yet there is at least some evidence that they

<!-- chunk -->

### can all be helpful to at least some people with depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, there are more aggressive treatments, like TMS, ECT, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### surgery, in which parts of the brain are severed or electrodes are implanted

<!-- chunk -->

### to stimulate the brain or the vagus nerve, the main nerve of the

<!-- chunk -->

### parasympathetic nervous system.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s a lot of different treatments! It’s difficult to understand how they

<!-- chunk -->

### can all treat the same set of symptoms. However, not one of these works for

<!-- chunk -->

### all people with depression. Why not? Are there just different causes of

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression in different people that require different treatments? And

<!-- chunk -->

### sadly, as I reviewed in the last chapter, there are millions of people who try

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment after treatment without finding even one that works.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the flip side, it’s important to point out that not everyone who

<!-- chunk -->

### develops major depression even gets treatment—in fact, the majority of

<!-- chunk -->

### sufferers throughout the world do not. Yet major depression will often

<!-- chunk -->

### resolve on its own. The symptoms can come and go, sometimes lasting a

<!-- chunk -->

### few weeks or months and then spontaneously disappearing. What causes

<!-- chunk -->

### some people’s symptoms to go away without any treatment? Why, for

<!-- chunk -->

### others, does depression become a chronic and debilitating illness? If we

<!-- chunk -->

### truly understand what causes this disorder, we should be able to answer

<!-- chunk -->

### these questions.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the picture gets more complicated still. In addition to risk factors or

<!-- chunk -->

### theories about what causes major depression, we have good evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### physical changes in the body that are associated with major depression—

<!-- chunk -->

### that is, they are found more often in those with the disease than those

<!-- chunk -->

### without it. These are changes that have been observed in people who

<!-- chunk -->

### already have the diagnosis, but they may also provide clues about the cause

<!-- chunk -->

### of the disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation is a big one. We know that when compared to those without

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, people with chronic depression, on average, have higher levels

<!-- chunk -->

### of inflammation, as measured by different biomarkers, such as C-reactive

<!-- chunk -->

### protein and interleukins.


<!-- chunk -->

### At this point, however, we don’t know for sure if

<!-- chunk -->

### the inflammation is causing the depression or if the depression is causing

<!-- chunk -->

### the inflammation. And if the inflammation is causing the depression, what

<!-- chunk -->

### starts the inflammation in the first place? Is it one or more of the risk factors

<!-- chunk -->

### that we’ve discussed so far? Or is it something else altogether that we just

<!-- chunk -->

### haven’t discovered yet? As usual, many people have theories—some

<!-- chunk -->

### speculate that it is a chronic infection, or an autoimmune disease, or

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to a toxin, or a bad diet, or having a “leaky gut,” and on and on—

<!-- chunk -->

### but these theories are not answers. What’s more, not everyone with chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### depression has higher levels of inflammation, at least not that we can

<!-- chunk -->

### measure. The research showing higher levels of inflammation is based on

<!-- chunk -->

### comparisons between groups of people: When looking at a group of people

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression and a group without, the group with depression has more

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation . . . but not every individual in the depressed group will have

<!-- chunk -->

### higher levels of inflammation than the individuals in the group without

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. In fact, researchers and clinicians have not identified any

<!-- chunk -->

### parameter for measuring inflammation in the body or brain that will

<!-- chunk -->

### consistently separate people who are suffering from depression from those

<!-- chunk -->

### who aren’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to differences in inflammation levels, we have identified

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in the brains of people with chronic depression. Some people

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression have shrinkage, or atrophy, of specific brain regions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### this can progress over time. Because these types of changes are often seen

<!-- chunk -->

### in neuro-degenerative disorders, some researchers speculate that depression

<!-- chunk -->

### might be a neurodegenerative disorder as well, or that it could represent the

<!-- chunk -->

### early stages of another neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer’s or

<!-- chunk -->

### Parkinson’s.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other researchers speculate that these changes might be the

<!-- chunk -->

### result of the increased inflammation associated with depression. We know

<!-- chunk -->

### that inflammation over a prolonged period of time can cause damage to

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue. For example, when a person’s knee is inflamed by arthritis, we know

<!-- chunk -->

### that permanent damage can result; the longer the inflammation lasts, the

<!-- chunk -->

### more the damage

<!-- chunk -->

### progresses. Maybe something like that is happening in the brain—the

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation comes first and causes damage to these brain regions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research has also found a number of differences in the way the brains

<!-- chunk -->

### of depressed people function. When comparing functional MRI scans of

<!-- chunk -->

### those with major depression to those without, depressed people seem to

<!-- chunk -->

### have decreased activity in some brain regions and increased activity in

<!-- chunk -->

### others, as well as differences in the way brain regions communicate with

<!-- chunk -->

### each other.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, as with all of these brain changes we’ve discussed,

<!-- chunk -->

### the studies have only shown relative differences between groups. And once

<!-- chunk -->

### again, we don’t know if these changes are the cause of depression or a

<!-- chunk -->

### consequence of it. Could another process be causing both the depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and these brain changes? We just don’t know yet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, let’s throw another wrench into the works—the gut microbiome.

<!-- chunk -->

### The human digestive system contains trillions of microorganisms, including

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They produce hormones, neurotransmitters, and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory molecules that get released into our gut and then absorbed

<!-- chunk -->

### into our bloodstreams. Research suggests that these microbes play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, anxiety, autism, and

<!-- chunk -->

### even schizophrenia.


<!-- chunk -->

### But microbiome research is relatively new, and we

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t yet know the details of which specific microorganisms might be

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial and which ones harmful, or in fact if it’s about the mere presence

<!-- chunk -->

### or absence of certain organisms at all; it could also be that the key lies in the

<!-- chunk -->

### balance of different types of organisms. More to the point, although some

<!-- chunk -->

### research in mice has found changes in depressive symptoms mediated

<!-- chunk -->

### through changes in the gut microbiome, we don’t yet know how to use this

<!-- chunk -->

### information to effectively treat depression or most other disorders.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, that’s a whirlwind tour through major depression—many of the risk

<!-- chunk -->

### factors, an overview of some theories about what causes it and the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments aimed at those causes, and some of the biological and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### changes that are seen in people with the disorder. So, given all that, how do

<!-- chunk -->

### we answer the question: “What causes major depression?”

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why the biopsychosocial model makes sense—there are

<!-- chunk -->

### biological things, psychological things, and social factors that may come

<!-- chunk -->

### together

<!-- chunk -->

### differently in different people to result in major depression. Put another

<!-- chunk -->

### way, there are different causes in different people. Some researchers and

<!-- chunk -->

### clinicians claim that there must be different types of depression—maybe

<!-- chunk -->

### one type that’s caused by social stressors and another type that’s caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### biological factors. Maybe there are dozens of different types of depression

<!-- chunk -->

### —all caused by these various risk factors. Maybe certain factors are

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible for certain symptoms, and if we did a better job of clustering

<!-- chunk -->

### these symptoms, we could identify these types and get a better handle on

<!-- chunk -->

### these causes. Unfortunately, this doesn’t appear to be the answer. Clinicians

<!-- chunk -->

### and researchers have struggled with this for decades, and the same set of

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms continues to come up over and over again across categories,

<!-- chunk -->

### regardless of the risk factors or perceived causes of the depression, whether

<!-- chunk -->

### they are biological, psychological, social, or some combination. The same

<!-- chunk -->

### constellation of symptoms has been found in countless people, in countless

<!-- chunk -->

### varieties of circumstance. In fact, the symptoms of major depression have

<!-- chunk -->

### been described in the Bible, historic texts, literature, poetry, and medical

<!-- chunk -->

### records dating back to Hippocrates. So what causes it? There must be an

<!-- chunk -->

### answer—one that ties together all the facts about the different risk factors,

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatments that work, and the brain and body changes that we see time

<!-- chunk -->

### and again.

<!-- chunk -->

### Is it possible that there are different processes leading to the same set of

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms in different people, completely independent of each other? Well,

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s possible, but it would be highly unlikely. You may have heard of

<!-- chunk -->

### Occam’s razor—it’s a general rule or guideline, also known as the law of

<!-- chunk -->

### parsimony. It is usually held to mean that the simplest, most unifying

<!-- chunk -->

### explanation is most likely to be correct. For example, all things being equal,

<!-- chunk -->

### if a patient comes in with a high fever, sore neck, and headache, it is less

<!-- chunk -->

### likely that the patient has a headache due to a brain hemorrhage and a sore

<!-- chunk -->

### neck due to a pinched nerve and a fever due to an infection than it is that

<!-- chunk -->

### the patient has meningitis—one diagnosis that explains all three signs and

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. In short, when faced with a situation like the one we have

<!-- chunk -->

### outlined for major depression, a unifying theory that can connect all the

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence in a logical and plausible way is most likely to be correct. Before

<!-- chunk -->

### we get too far down the road toward the answer, though, it is worth

<!-- chunk -->

### considering why it matters in the first place.

# Why the Cause Matters—Treating Symptoms Versus

# Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### When diagnosing someone with a disorder, we rely on signs and symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### People often use the term “symptoms” as a catchall, but the difference

<!-- chunk -->

### between signs and symptoms is a crucial one. Signs are objective indicators

<!-- chunk -->

### of an illness that can be observed or measured by someone else. Signs can

<!-- chunk -->

### include things such as a seizure, a blood pressure measurement, a laboratory

<!-- chunk -->

### value, or an abnormality seen on a brain scan. Symptoms are subjective

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences that a patient must tell someone about. Symptoms can include

<!-- chunk -->

### things such as moods, thoughts, or experiences of pain or numbness. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are very few signs in psychiatry. Instead, most of our diagnoses are based

<!-- chunk -->

### on symptoms, such as irritability, anxiety, fear, depression, abnormal

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts or perceptions, and impaired memory. Mental disorders can also

<!-- chunk -->

### include things that seem more “physical” than “mental,” like sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### disturbances, slowed movements, fatigue, and hyperactivity. Some of these

<!-- chunk -->

### can be observed, but clinicians often rely on patients to tell them about

<!-- chunk -->

### these, too, putting them into the category of symptoms as opposed to signs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, there are no laboratory tests, brain scans, or other objective

<!-- chunk -->

### tests that can accurately diagnose any mental disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Psychiatric diagnoses are all based on the concept of syndromes. A

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome is a cluster of signs and symptoms that commonly occur together,

<!-- chunk -->

### with a cause that is not yet known. One medical example that began in the

<!-- chunk -->

### 1980s was the syndrome of unusual infections and rare cancers that we

<!-- chunk -->

### called AIDS—acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Before we knew that

<!-- chunk -->

### it was due to a virus, it was a syndrome. In psychiatry, every diagnosis is a

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome. This is inherent to the definition of a psychiatric disorder. When

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms are caused by a medical or neurological condition, that

<!-- chunk -->

### alone excludes classifying them as a psychiatric disorder. Neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses, cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases can all affect the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain. When people with these conditions have mental symptoms, they are

<!-- chunk -->

### not necessarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. If a patient comes in

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from irritability, depression, and memory loss, and further

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluation

<!-- chunk -->

### reveals that these symptoms are the result of an infection or cancer, they are

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with that condition and treated by a medical specialist outside of

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatry, even if their mental symptoms are indistinguishable from those

<!-- chunk -->

### of a patient who “just” has depression. Psychiatrists and other mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals are left with everyone else—the ones for whom we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### know the exact cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is at the heart of the difficulty we’ve had in making progress in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health care. Without a clear cause, we end up treating symptoms as

<!-- chunk -->

### opposed to disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some treatments are designed to attack the root cause of an illness. The

<!-- chunk -->

### best example is an infectious disease. A bacterial infection can cause many

<!-- chunk -->

### signs and symptoms—fever, changes in blood cell counts, chills, pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### cough, and fatigue, to name a few. Definitive treatment for the infection is

<!-- chunk -->

### an antibiotic that eliminates the bacteria from the body. This type of

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment is sometimes referred to as a disease-modifying treatment. In this

<!-- chunk -->

### case, the treatment will cure the illness; after the course of antibiotics, the

<!-- chunk -->

### person will no longer have the infection. But there is another type of

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment commonly used in the medical field; treatments in this category

<!-- chunk -->

### are known as symptomatic treatments. They are designed to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, which can help people feel better, but they don’t directly change

<!-- chunk -->

### the course of the illness. For example, people with bacterial infections are

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly given symptomatic treatments like Tylenol to reduce fever.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptomatic treatments can reduce suffering and allow people to work and

<!-- chunk -->

### function normally, but they are not addressing the root cause. In the end,

<!-- chunk -->

### with or without Tylenol, either the body will fight off the infection on its

<!-- chunk -->

### own, the person will get antibiotic treatment, or the infection will progress

<!-- chunk -->

### and the person will die. Tylenol won’t really make much of a difference in

<!-- chunk -->

### which of these outcomes occur.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the mental health field, the reality is that most of our treatments are

<!-- chunk -->

### symptomatic. For most people, psychiatric medications, ECT, and TMS are

<!-- chunk -->

### usually symptomatic treatments. They don’t appear to address the root

<!-- chunk -->

### cause of the illness. For some, they can markedly reduce symptoms. In

<!-- chunk -->

### others, they can put the illness into remission, meaning that all the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### get completely better. There are people, like John, who can use

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants or other medications for a year or two and then live happily

<!-- chunk -->

### ever after without them. Does this mean that the medications were disease

<!-- chunk -->

### modifying? In some cases, like John’s, it’s possible they are. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### given the extremely high rates of continuing symptoms and relapses in most

<!-- chunk -->

### people with mental disorders, our treatments don’t appear to be modifying

<!-- chunk -->

### the diseases themselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### As for psychotherapy and social interventions, there are those who

<!-- chunk -->

### believe that these treatments are addressing root causes. In some cases, this

<!-- chunk -->

### makes sense. For example, if a woman is in a physically abusive

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship and is clinically depressed as a result, helping her leave that

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship and build a new and better life may resolve her depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many psychotherapists would argue that the root cause of the woman’s

<!-- chunk -->

### depression was being in an abusive relationship. However, we know that

<!-- chunk -->

### because she has gone through the experience of an abusive relationship and

<!-- chunk -->

### developed clinical depression, she is now at increased risk for developing

<!-- chunk -->

### depression again at some point in the future, even if she is never in another

<!-- chunk -->

### abusive relationship. Given this fact, it seems there may be more to the

<!-- chunk -->

### depression than just the abuse, and that treating this factor alone did not

<!-- chunk -->

### definitively address the root cause. What causes her to remain at higher risk

<!-- chunk -->

### of developing depression in the future? If we truly understand what causes

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness, we should be able to answer this question.

<!-- chunk -->

### People in the mental health field often use circular logic to support their

<!-- chunk -->

### theories about what causes mental illness. For example, they may claim that

<!-- chunk -->

### if something works to relieve symptoms, it must have been the cause to

<!-- chunk -->

### begin with. The fact that the woman in the example above found relief

<!-- chunk -->

### when her situation changed is used as evidence that this situation was the

<!-- chunk -->

### root cause of her clinical depression. The fact that many psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### medications help relieve the symptoms of mental illness is used as evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### that the root cause of mental illness must be a chemical imbalance. As

<!-- chunk -->

### logical as this may seem, it isn’t always true.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s an example to illustrate some of the flaws in this line of

<!-- chunk -->

### reasoning. Let’s go back to an infection that is causing a fever. If we didn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### know

<!-- chunk -->

### anything about infections or the causes of fever, and we were trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### figure it all out, we might do brain scans on people with fevers, looking for

<!-- chunk -->

### clues. Guess what we would see? We would see that the hypothalamus is

<!-- chunk -->

### overactive—that’s the part of the brain that controls the fever response. If

<!-- chunk -->

### we already knew that Tylenol works to reduce fevers, we might then do

<!-- chunk -->

### scans to research how Tylenol affects the brain. Lo and behold, we would

<!-- chunk -->

### see that Tylenol decreases this excessive activity in the hypothalamus!

<!-- chunk -->

### Based on this, we might logically conclude that the cause of the fever is a

<!-- chunk -->

### brain disorder involving the hypothalamus. We would have proof that a

<!-- chunk -->

### fevered patient’s brain activity is abnormal and that Tylenol works to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### that abnormal activity. But it would be deeply misguided to conclude that

<!-- chunk -->

### we’d identified the fever’s cause. What we really did was identify a part of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain that is involved in the production of a fever, and prove that a

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment that reduces fever affects that part of the brain as well. But

<!-- chunk -->

### Tylenol doesn’t treat infections. Reducing fever with that treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### wouldn’t change the course of the illness. Our fever and Tylenol brain scans

<!-- chunk -->

### only identified one aspect of the body’s response to an infection. We would

<!-- chunk -->

### better understand one symptom of the illness, or one part of its mechanism.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s useful information, but it doesn’t help us understand the root cause of

<!-- chunk -->

### the fever at all—an infection.

# Correlations, Causes, and Common Pathways

<!-- chunk -->

### To answer the question of what causes mental illness, it is important to

<!-- chunk -->

### think a little about how we go about asking such a question, and the tools

<!-- chunk -->

### and principles we use to explore it. When medical researchers are doing

<!-- chunk -->

### their detective work to determine what causes an illness, they often study

<!-- chunk -->

### groups of people with and without the illness to look for correlations. A

<!-- chunk -->

### correlation is a relationship or connection between two things, or variables.

<!-- chunk -->

### If two variables are correlated, it might imply a cause-and-effect

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship, which is ultimately what the researchers are looking for. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are many types of studies designed to look for correlations. Researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### might

<!-- chunk -->

### perform brain scans on groups of people with and without depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### look for differences—the association with inflammation mentioned earlier

<!-- chunk -->

### is a correlation, the result of noticing that two variables (depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation) seemed to occur more often together, implying a

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship. One common type of study is an epidemiology study, which

<!-- chunk -->

### assesses variables in large populations of people and looks for correlations

<!-- chunk -->

### that way. For example, researchers might measure people’s weight, follow

<!-- chunk -->

### them for ten years, and record how many suffer heart attacks over that ten-

<!-- chunk -->

### year period. They would then look at the rates of heart attacks for different

<!-- chunk -->

### groups of people based on their starting weights to see if weight was

<!-- chunk -->

### correlated with heart attacks. If they found that obese people had higher

<!-- chunk -->

### rates of heart attacks than thin people, they would conclude that there was a

<!-- chunk -->

### correlation between obesity and suffering a heart attack. Notice that I said

<!-- chunk -->

### “correlation.” Based on this study alone, they can’t say that being obese

<!-- chunk -->

### causes heart attacks. This is one of the tricky things about correlational

<!-- chunk -->

### research. People often misinterpret the findings and make assumptions that

<!-- chunk -->

### aren’t warranted.

<!-- chunk -->

### Correlation does not equal causation. Almost everyone has heard this.

<!-- chunk -->

### It means that a correlation does not necessarily tell us anything about cause

<!-- chunk -->

### and effect. Unfortunately, while most people are aware of the principle, they

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t apply it when interpreting research. If the study in the example I just

<!-- chunk -->

### discussed were released today, the headlines would likely read “Obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### Proven to Cause Heart Attacks,” further perpetuating the incorrect

<!-- chunk -->

### interpretation of studies like this. This may seem like semantics. You might

<!-- chunk -->

### be thinking, “Of course obesity causes heart attacks. What’s your point?”

<!-- chunk -->

### Well, as a matter of fact, obesity, in and of itself, does not cause heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks. It is a strong risk factor for having a heart attack, but it’s not a

<!-- chunk -->

### definitive cause. What’s the difference? Not all obese people experience

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attacks. If obesity causes heart attacks, all obese people should have

<!-- chunk -->

### them, and probably have them often. Also, there are plenty of people who

<!-- chunk -->

### are stricken by heart attacks who are not obese. If obesity is the cause of

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attacks, why would a thin person ever have one? Clearly, there must

<!-- chunk -->

### be more to heart attacks than obesity. So, what does cause a heart attack?

<!-- chunk -->

### The correct answer might

<!-- chunk -->

### be something along the lines of “the heart’s arteries develop atherosclerosis

<!-- chunk -->

### (thickening or hardening) and, at some point, become obstructed, resulting

<!-- chunk -->

### in some of the heart muscle dying or being damaged due to a lack of blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow.” What causes those things to happen? That’s where obesity comes in

<!-- chunk -->

### as a risk factor, but other risk factors also contribute to this process, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### genetics, cholesterol and lipid levels, blood pressure, a lack of exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

### stress, poor sleep, and smoking. There is a cascade of events that leads to a

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attack; this cascade of events occurs over years. Understanding the

<!-- chunk -->

### entire cascade of events is important, as it offers numerous opportunities to

<!-- chunk -->

### intervene with different treatments. If we assume the cause is obesity and

<!-- chunk -->

### focus all our treatments on this risk factor, we will fail to prevent heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks in many people. How we define the cause of illness matters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone likes simple answers. The way I just defined the cause of a heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attack is a complicated answer. As you will learn, this is also the case when

<!-- chunk -->

### answering the question: “What causes mental illness?”

<!-- chunk -->

### Correlations, or relationships between two variables, can exist for

<!-- chunk -->

### several reasons. The most common interpretations are cause or

<!-- chunk -->

### consequence: One variable causes the other or is a consequence of the other.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, if A and B are correlated, it might be because there is a

<!-- chunk -->

### cause-and-effect relationship, where A causes B or B causes A. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is another possibility—one that some people have trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding. Correlations can also reveal a common pathway or,

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes, a common root cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s assume we don’t yet know anything about the cold virus. All we

<!-- chunk -->

### know is that lots of people are showing up at the doctor with runny noses

<!-- chunk -->

### and sore throats. Some people also have other symptoms, such as headaches

<!-- chunk -->

### or fatigue, along with their runny noses and sore throats. Some have only

<!-- chunk -->

### one or the other—a runny nose or a sore throat—but many, many people

<!-- chunk -->

### have both. Researchers notice that there is a correlation between runny

<!-- chunk -->

### noses and sore throats. Since there is a correlation, there must be a

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship. But what relationship? Is it cause and effect? If so, which

<!-- chunk -->

### causes which? Many people seem to get their sore throats first and then

<!-- chunk -->

### develop runny noses, but not all—in fact, sometimes it is the opposite. So

<!-- chunk -->

### does the sore throat come first and cause the runny nose? Is it the other way

<!-- chunk -->

### around?

<!-- chunk -->

### Or are they both simply consequences of some unidentified illness that can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause both symptoms, and maybe even others?

<!-- chunk -->

### Even though this is a straightforward example of an infection with the

<!-- chunk -->

### cold virus, at one point in time this all needed puzzling out. One source of

<!-- chunk -->

### confusion might have been people with allergies developing runny noses

<!-- chunk -->

### and sore throats when pollen levels were high. These people would present

<!-- chunk -->

### with the same, or similar, symptoms, but from a different root cause—

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies instead of the cold virus. The researchers would have to work hard

<!-- chunk -->

### to tease these two groups apart, trying to sort patients in various ways. At

<!-- chunk -->

### the end of the day, the symptoms in question would likely be

<!-- chunk -->

### indistinguishable: a runny nose is a runny nose, whether it’s from allergies

<!-- chunk -->

### or a cold. Researchers might have more luck by noticing things like

<!-- chunk -->

### seasonal patterns, or that some people seem to spread their symptoms to

<!-- chunk -->

### others (those with the cold virus) while others don’t (allergies). Looking for

<!-- chunk -->

### and combining patterns would give the researchers important clues about

<!-- chunk -->

### how to distinguish the two groups. In the end, they would have to address

<!-- chunk -->

### this important question: Are the runny noses and sore throats in these two

<!-- chunk -->

### different groups of people related in some way? They are, after all, the same

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. Why?

<!-- chunk -->

### The answer is that they share a common pathway—inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation is part of the body’s process of healing tissue and/or fighting

<!-- chunk -->

### off an attack, and it occurs whenever the immune system is activated.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whether the body is mounting a defense against a cold virus or an allergen,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation is causing the runny noses and sore throats. Inflammation is

<!-- chunk -->

### the common pathway or process that produces the symptoms for both

<!-- chunk -->

### groups of patients, but that pathway is downstream from the root cause. To

<!-- chunk -->

### get to the root causes, the researchers will need to determine what’s causing

<!-- chunk -->

### the inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another way researchers might try to understand the symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### runny noses and sore throats and their causes might be to look at them

<!-- chunk -->

### separately. Not everyone has both symptoms, and some people with both

<!-- chunk -->

### have mostly one or the other. Our researchers might sort people into a group

<!-- chunk -->

### of those with primarily or only runny noses and another of those with

<!-- chunk -->

### primarily or only sore throats. This could make sense. After all, noses are

<!-- chunk -->

### different than throats. The treatments for the two symptoms are also

<!-- chunk -->

### different. Tylenol might help soothe the pain of sore throats, but it wouldn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### help runny noses. The most effective treatments for runny noses would

<!-- chunk -->

### primarily be things like pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, ingredients

<!-- chunk -->

### found in Sudafed and cold and flu medications. There might be some

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments that relieve both symptoms in some patients—for instance, an

<!-- chunk -->

### antihistamine in those with allergies—but Tylenol would help almost all

<!-- chunk -->

### sore throats, and pseudoephedrine almost all runny noses, while neither

<!-- chunk -->

### would affect the other symptom. This stark difference in treatments might

<!-- chunk -->

### support the categorization of people into a runny nose group or a sore throat

<!-- chunk -->

### group. The researchers might label these distinct disorders—runny nose

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder and sore throat disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Given that the treatments for these disorders are so distinct as well, they

<!-- chunk -->

### might instead think of these disorders as they relate to those treatments. The

<!-- chunk -->

### sore throat group might be thought of as having a Tylenol deficiency

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder: sore throats must be due to people not having enough Tylenol in

<!-- chunk -->

### their system, as correcting this deficiency seems to rectify the problem. The

<!-- chunk -->

### other group might be called pseudoephedrine deficiency disorder, as the

<!-- chunk -->

### effectiveness of the treatment clearly indicates a pseudoephedrine

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### As facetious as this seems, this is the very same logic that we use to

<!-- chunk -->

### conclude that depression is due to a serotonin deficiency and psychosis is

<!-- chunk -->

### due to too much dopamine. It makes sense, until you think about it with an

<!-- chunk -->

### example like the cold virus, which we understand well. In this context, it

<!-- chunk -->

### seems ridiculous. Yet that’s what we are doing in the mental health field

<!-- chunk -->

### today. We look at the treatments that work and assume that this tells us the

<!-- chunk -->

### story of what’s causing the disorders. And the disorders themselves are

<!-- chunk -->

### simply clusters of symptoms we have labeled disorders—the diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

### labels mean nothing in terms of cause and effect, or what is happening in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body or brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s return to our hypothetical researchers. These researchers have

<!-- chunk -->

### identified two distinct disorders—runny nose disorder and sore throat

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. The disorders have different symptoms and different treatments,

<!-- chunk -->

### so the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers are feeling pretty confident about this classification system. The

<!-- chunk -->

### problem is that, while there are people with just one disorder or the other,

<!-- chunk -->

### comorbidity is common—in other words, there are a lot of people who have

<!-- chunk -->

### both disorders. People diagnosed with runny nose disorder commonly also

<!-- chunk -->

### develop sore throat disorder. But it’s also true in reverse. Runny noses and

<!-- chunk -->

### sore throats are a good example of a bidirectional relationship. It means

<!-- chunk -->

### that if you have either disorder you are at much higher risk for developing

<!-- chunk -->

### the other one. It doesn’t matter which one starts first. A bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship often means that the two things share some common pathway.

<!-- chunk -->

### For runny noses and sore throats, as I’ve already discussed, the common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway is inflammation. Sometimes, in addition to a common pathway, a

<!-- chunk -->

### bidirectional relationship can also imply the same root cause. In this

<!-- chunk -->

### example, we already know that there is a common pathway (inflammation)

<!-- chunk -->

### and different root causes (the cold virus and allergies, among others).

<!-- chunk -->

### Comorbidity aside, given that the symptoms and treatments are

<!-- chunk -->

### different, researchers and clinicians might advocate for keeping runny nose

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder and sore throat disorder as separate diagnoses. But once someone

<!-- chunk -->

### comes along and identifies the common pathway or a root cause that

<!-- chunk -->

### produces both disorders, this should change. Why? Back to Occam’s razor

<!-- chunk -->

### —the law of parsimony. If there is a simpler explanation for something in

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, that explanation is more likely to be true. In this case, the

<!-- chunk -->

### explanation of the cold virus (a root cause) causing both disorders is much

<!-- chunk -->

### simpler than that of people developing both sore throat disorder (due to a

<!-- chunk -->

### Tylenol deficiency) and runny nose disorder (due to a pseudoephedrine

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance) at the same time. Identifying that allergies (a different root

<!-- chunk -->

### cause) can cause both disorders would be an equally valid reason to change

<!-- chunk -->

### the medical field’s approach to diagnosis based on these symptoms. And of

<!-- chunk -->

### course, identifying the common pathway (inflammation) would be

<!-- chunk -->

### especially helpful, as it would allow the development of more effective

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments—and also explain why the symptoms of two different root-cause

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, a cold and allergies, can be identical.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the same root cause can also result in different symptoms in

<!-- chunk -->

### different people . . . especially when preexisting vulnerabilities come into

<!-- chunk -->

### play. The flu

<!-- chunk -->

### is a great example. People infected with this virus usually experience a

<!-- chunk -->

### predictable array of signs and symptoms—fever, muscle aches, lethargy,

<!-- chunk -->

### and so on. Yet even though they all have the same illness, different people

<!-- chunk -->

### can have different symptoms to varying degrees. And in people with

<!-- chunk -->

### preexisting conditions, this difference can be magnified. A healthy twenty-

<!-- chunk -->

### year-old might spend a miserable weekend feeling achy and feverish and

<!-- chunk -->

### then bounce back quickly. On the other hand, a child with preexisting

<!-- chunk -->

### asthma might develop severe airway inflammation and end up in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hospital on a ventilator. A frail eighty-year-old man might experience

<!-- chunk -->

### devastating effects resulting in organ damage and death. These people’s

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering stemmed from a single root cause—infection with the flu virus—

<!-- chunk -->

### but that cause produced very different consequences.

<!-- chunk -->

### At this point, you can probably see both why the question of what

<!-- chunk -->

### causes mental illness matters and why it has remained so persistently

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult to answer. We in the mental health field are working with

<!-- chunk -->

### syndromes defined by symptoms and symptomatic treatments. Right now,

<!-- chunk -->

### we are treating infections with Tylenol. The goal is to understand the

<!-- chunk -->

### physiology of mental disorders, enabling us to develop effective treatments,

<!-- chunk -->

### and ideally, prevent these disorders before they occur.

<!-- chunk -->

### Causation is proving that one thing causes another. Correlational studies

<!-- chunk -->

### on their own simply cannot do this. They can suggest causation, or at least

<!-- chunk -->

### provide clues, but proving causation requires something more. One type of

<!-- chunk -->

### study that can prove causation is called a randomized controlled trial. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, to prove that the cold virus can cause a runny nose, researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### could take a group of people who are not sick, expose half of them to the

<!-- chunk -->

### cold virus by squirting the virus up their noses and the other half to a

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo (by squirting plain water up their noses). They could then record

<!-- chunk -->

### the number of people in each group who develop runny noses over the

<!-- chunk -->

### following five days. If the cold virus causes runny noses, the group exposed

<!-- chunk -->

### to the cold virus should have a much higher rate of runny noses than the

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo group. In fact, these studies have been done, and this is true.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the challenges in proving causation of a serious or life-

<!-- chunk -->

### threatening disorder in humans is that randomized controlled trials are

<!-- chunk -->

### unethical. Thus,

<!-- chunk -->

### even if we do have a plausible theory of what causes cancer, or mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, it will be unethical to expose people to this cause to test the theory

<!-- chunk -->

### definitively. So, what can be done in situations like this? Researchers are

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes allowed to do equivalent experiments on animals. In the mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health field, this can play a role, but it has some limitations given the nature

<!-- chunk -->

### of mental disorders. Another alternative would be to develop a scientific

<!-- chunk -->

### theory of what might be happening in the body or brain from beginning to

<!-- chunk -->

### end—the cascade of events that leads to mental illness, like the cascade of

<!-- chunk -->

### events we talked about earlier as leading to a heart attack. Once established,

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers can then study people who have already been exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### different risk factors and look for evidence of this cascade of events

<!-- chunk -->

### occurring in them. As you will learn, all of this research has already taken

<!-- chunk -->

### place; the evidence has been gathered. It’s just that no one has put it all

<!-- chunk -->

### together. That’s what this book does.

# O


# Searching for a Common Pathway

<!-- chunk -->

### ne of the challenges in determining what causes mental illness lies

<!-- chunk -->

### in defining what constitutes a mental illness in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dictionaries and reference books differ in their exact wording, but a

<!-- chunk -->

### good all-purpose version might be this: A mental illness involves

<!-- chunk -->

### changes or abnormalities in emotions, cognition, motivation, and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors resulting in distress or problems functioning in life. Context

<!-- chunk -->

### matters, though. One of the tricky things about defining mental illness is

<!-- chunk -->

### that many—even most—of the symptoms are considered “normal” in at

<!-- chunk -->

### least some circumstances.

<!-- chunk -->

### We all have emotions, for example, both pleasant and unpleasant ones.

<!-- chunk -->

### We might feel anxious when we face challenging or threatening situations.

<!-- chunk -->

### We might feel depressed when we experience a significant loss, such as the

<!-- chunk -->

### death of a loved one. Even something like paranoia can have an appropriate

<!-- chunk -->

### time and place. Have you ever watched a scary movie—one that truly

<!-- chunk -->

### terrified you? If so, you were likely a bit paranoid afterward. Some people

<!-- chunk -->

### look in their closets before they go to bed after watching such a movie. Or

<!-- chunk -->

### they hear sounds outside and feel terrified, imagining it’s a scenario from

<!-- chunk -->

### the movie. All of this is normal. However, at some point, intense unpleasant

<!-- chunk -->

### feelings and states should diminish, allowing you to go on with your life as

<!-- chunk -->

### before. Therefore, it’s important that any definition of mental illness

<!-- chunk -->

### somehow account for context, duration, and appropriateness.

<!-- chunk -->

### For an example of what I mean, consider “shyness.” Are people allowed

<!-- chunk -->

### to be shy? Is that normal? Most would say yes. So, at what point does

<!-- chunk -->

### shyness turn into an anxiety disorder such as social phobia? Drawing these

<!-- chunk -->

### lines is a matter of some debate in the field. One of the most notable

<!-- chunk -->

### controversies concerns depression—specifically whether, in some

<!-- chunk -->

### situations, these symptoms are “normal” and not an illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, is

<!-- chunk -->

### the “bible” of psychiatry. It defines all the different diagnoses, their

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnostic criteria, and provides some relevant information and statistics.

<!-- chunk -->

### The current version, updated in 2022, is known as “DSM-5-TR.” In DSM-

<!-- chunk -->

### IV, the diagnostic criteria for depression included a caveat called the

<!-- chunk -->

### bereavement exception.


<!-- chunk -->

### It suggested that if someone had symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression in the context of the loss of a loved one, clinicians should hold

<!-- chunk -->

### off on diagnosing depression. A professional might certainly offer support

<!-- chunk -->

### in the form of talk therapy, but prescribing medications wasn’t necessarily

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate. The exception had limits—among them, the depression should

<!-- chunk -->

### not last more than two months and should not produce suicidal thoughts or

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic symptoms. In DSM-5, however, the exception was removed

<!-- chunk -->

### altogether. This served to encourage clinicians to diagnose depression even

<!-- chunk -->

### in the context of stressful life events like the loss of a loved one. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### clinicians and researchers felt that the American Psychiatric Association

<!-- chunk -->

### (which produces the DSM) had gone too far in pathologizing experiences

<!-- chunk -->

### like grief. On the other hand, supporters of the exemption’s removal cited

<!-- chunk -->

### research showing that antidepressants can decrease symptoms of depression

<!-- chunk -->

### even in the context of grief. These advocates felt that not diagnosing the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem and offering medication treatment might be unnecessarily cruel.


<!-- chunk -->

### Despite such controversies, there are many situations that seem clear-

<!-- chunk -->

### cut. When someone has crippling hallucinations and delusions, or

<!-- chunk -->

### suffers from overwhelming fear and anxiety every time they leave their

<!-- chunk -->

### home, or can’t get out of bed for weeks at a time due to severe depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### most of us would agree that this constitutes a mental illness. The “unusual”

<!-- chunk -->

### or “inappropriate” nature or degree of their symptoms, the intensity of their

<!-- chunk -->

### distress, and their inability to function all suggest a serious problem that

<!-- chunk -->

### merits the diagnosis of a disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### The premise of the DSM, both the current and prior versions, is that

<!-- chunk -->

### there are distinct mental disorders with clear criteria that can be used to

<!-- chunk -->

### separate them from one another. In some cases, these distinctions are

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious. Schizophrenia is very different from an anxiety disorder. Dementia

<!-- chunk -->

### is different from ADHD. These distinctions are supposed to help guide

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment, predict what will happen to people with specific diagnoses (their

<!-- chunk -->

### prognosis), serve as a tool for clinicians and researchers to communicate

<!-- chunk -->

### more effectively with each other, and so on.

<!-- chunk -->

### The diagnoses in the DSM are given tremendous importance. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### required for clinical care and reimbursement by insurance companies. They

<!-- chunk -->

### are almost always needed to get research funding given that most mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness studies focus on just one disorder at a time. And they are critically

<!-- chunk -->

### important to the development and dissemination of treatments as well, since

<!-- chunk -->

### to get FDA approval for a drug, pharmaceutical companies must conduct

<!-- chunk -->

### large clinical trials of specific medications for specific disorders and show a

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit. Even interventions such as psychotherapy are normally studied in

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical trials designed around one specific diagnosis. So, in many ways, the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health field revolves entirely around these diagnostic labels.

<!-- chunk -->

### The field, however, has been plagued by debates over how to diagnose

<!-- chunk -->

### different mental disorders, especially since (as we discussed in the previous

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter) there are no objective tests to definitively diagnose any mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. Instead, we use checklists of symptoms and criteria. We ask

<!-- chunk -->

### patients and family members what they are feeling, witnessing, and

<!-- chunk -->

### experiencing; we investigate, cross-reference, and explore; and then we

<!-- chunk -->

### make a diagnosis based on the best match or matches.

<!-- chunk -->

### In some situations, these diagnostic labels are extremely useful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember John who developed major depression? His diagnosis helped

<!-- chunk -->

### inform his

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment, and the treatment worked. John got better—all the way better.

<!-- chunk -->

### After a year of doing well, he was able to stop treatment and remain well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The diagnostic criteria allowed John’s psychiatrist to recognize the disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### understand different treatment options, choose ones that were likely to

<!-- chunk -->

### work, and then discontinue the treatments after a defined period of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, it’s not so simple—or successful—for others.

# Sorting Out the Similarities

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the challenges in the mental health field is that no two people with

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders are completely alike, even when they get diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### the same disorder. There are two primary reasons for this—heterogeneity

<!-- chunk -->

### and comorbidity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Heterogeneity refers to the fact that people diagnosed with the same

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder can have different symptoms, severity of symptoms, levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### impact on their ability to function, and courses of illness. Not one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses requires that all criteria be met. Instead, it’s a minimum number

<!-- chunk -->

### —for example, a major depression diagnosis requires at least five of the

<!-- chunk -->

### nine criteria. This makes for a lot of variability. One person with major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression can have depressed mood, excessive sleep, problems

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrating, low energy, and be eating much more than usual, resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### weight gain. Another person with this diagnosis might be unable to sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### more than three hours, have lost their appetite and shed twenty pounds, and

<!-- chunk -->

### along with depressed mood and low energy be thinking about suicide.

<!-- chunk -->

### These patients have very different symptoms that require differing

<!-- chunk -->

### approaches to treatment. One is thinking about harming himself while the

<!-- chunk -->

### other isn’t. One can’t sleep, so might benefit from a sleeping pill, while the

<!-- chunk -->

### other one is sleeping too much. Despite these striking differences, both

<!-- chunk -->

### might benefit from an antidepressant or psychotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Alan Schatzberg is a prominent depression researcher and a

<!-- chunk -->

### professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who

<!-- chunk -->

### has called for rethinking the diagnostic criteria for major depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Those

<!-- chunk -->

### in

<!-- chunk -->

### this field are frustrated with the lack of understanding of this common

<!-- chunk -->

### illness and continued poor treatment outcomes—as I mentioned earlier, the

<!-- chunk -->

### likelihood of a full and complete remission of major depression symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### with the first antidepressant a patient tries is only about 30 to 40 percent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Schatzberg notes that some symptoms that commonly occur in people

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with major depression are not included in the core diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

### criteria. For example, anxiety is a common symptom in many people with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, but it’s not among the nine in the DSM. The same goes for

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability, which is experienced by about 40 to 50 percent of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Pain is common, too, with physical pain present in about

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of people with major depression compared to only about 15 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of the general population.


<!-- chunk -->

### Are our treatment outcomes so poor because

<!-- chunk -->

### we’re missing or failing to include the treatment of other diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms?

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s not just depression that causes so much confusion and debate.

<!-- chunk -->

### There’s tremendous heterogeneity in all the psychiatric diagnoses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes, the differences are stark and dramatic. Some people diagnosed

<!-- chunk -->

### with OCD are still able to work and function normally in life, while others

<!-- chunk -->

### are completely disabled by their symptoms. People diagnosed with autism-

<!-- chunk -->

### spectrum disorder can be wildly different from each other. There are high-

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning billionaire businesspeople with this diagnosis, while others live

<!-- chunk -->

### in group homes unable to care for themselves. So, are these singular

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses really the same disorders? Or are they all simply on a spectrum,

<!-- chunk -->

### with some people having severe forms of the illness while others have a

<!-- chunk -->

### mild form? Unfortunately, the complexities don’t end there.

<!-- chunk -->

### Comorbidity is the other big factor that accounts for differences in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with the same diagnosis. About half of the people diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### any mental disorder have more than one.


<!-- chunk -->

### We talked about comorbidity a bit

<!-- chunk -->

### in the last chapter: Remember my discussion of runny nose disorder and

<!-- chunk -->

### sore throat disorder? While some people had one or the other, many had

<!-- chunk -->

### both. A similar example in the mental health field is that of depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety. The majority of people diagnosed with major depression also have

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, and most people diagnosed with anxiety disorders also have major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. For example, in a survey of over nine thousand US households,

<!-- chunk -->

### 68 percent of people with major depression also met criteria for an anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder at some point in their lives, and several studies have found that

<!-- chunk -->

### one-half to two-thirds of adults with anxiety disorders also meet criteria for

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Antidepressants are commonly used to treat both

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety disorders, while anti-anxiety medications are

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly used to treat people with both anxiety disorders and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, where the diagnoses often overlap and the treatments are sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### identical, are they really different disorders? Is it possible that they are

<!-- chunk -->

### simply different symptoms of the same disorder? Could anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression—like runny noses and sore throats—share a common pathway?

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, diagnoses can change over time. Symptoms can come and go

<!-- chunk -->

### and morph into very different mental disorders, further complicating

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment and diagnosis, and bedeviling the quest to investigate the nature

<!-- chunk -->

### and cause of these disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at an example.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mike is a forty-three-year-old man with a chronic, disabling mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. But which one? When he was a child, he was diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD and started taking stimulant medications. They helped somewhat,

<!-- chunk -->

### but school remained difficult. He was often bullied and teased. He reported

<!-- chunk -->

### a lot of anxiety around these social stressors and received psychotherapy for

<!-- chunk -->

### social anxiety disorder. Some clinicians raised the possibility of Asperger’s

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome, then a diagnosis of its own on the autism spectrum, but they

<!-- chunk -->

### didn’t officially make this diagnosis. By adolescence, he’d developed

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of major depression—not surprising given both his academic and

<!-- chunk -->

### social stressors. He was started on an antidepressant, which helped a little.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within a few months, however, Mike began to develop symptoms of mania

<!-- chunk -->

### and was quickly diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He had hallucinations and

<!-- chunk -->

### delusions, and he was given medication targeting both his psychotic and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood symptoms. He was hospitalized several times. Over the next year,

<!-- chunk -->

### when his psychotic symptoms persisted and failed to respond to treatment,

<!-- chunk -->

### his diagnosis was changed to schizoaffective disorder. Also during this

<!-- chunk -->

### time,

<!-- chunk -->

### Mike began to develop obsessions and compulsions, and he was diagnosed

<!-- chunk -->

### with OCD as well. Over the following several years, on top of his

<!-- chunk -->

### continuing psychiatric symptoms, he began to smoke cigarettes and use

<!-- chunk -->

### recreational drugs. Eventually, he became chronically addicted to opioids.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, what is Mike’s diagnosis? According to DSM-5, he currently can be

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, opioid use disorder, nicotine use

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, OCD, and social anxiety disorder. But in the past, he also had

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD, major depression, bipolar disorder, and possibly even Asperger’s

<!-- chunk -->

### syndrome. You might make a case that the major depression diagnosis was

<!-- chunk -->

### a mistake—many people with bipolar disorder are diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression before they have a first manic episode that clarifies the

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnostic picture. The same might be argued about the change of diagnosis

<!-- chunk -->

### from bipolar to schizoaffective disorder. But even if you remove one or two

<!-- chunk -->

### of these, you are left with a lengthy list of what are all different disorders—

<!-- chunk -->

### supposedly with different causes and certainly different treatments. Yet

<!-- chunk -->

### Mike has just one brain. Are we to believe that he’s an extraordinarily

<!-- chunk -->

### unlucky individual who developed some half dozen separate and distinct

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders?

<!-- chunk -->

### While Mike’s story is extreme, having more than one diagnosis is

<!-- chunk -->

### common, as are changes in symptoms and diagnoses. Having problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction is also common in people with mental disorders. Stories like

<!-- chunk -->

### Mike’s raise serious questions about the validity of our diagnostic labels. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the diagnoses listed in DSM-5 are really separate and distinct disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### why do so many people have more than one of them? Why do they change

<!-- chunk -->

### over the course of a lifetime? Do some psychiatric disorders lead to others?

<!-- chunk -->

### If so, which ones come first, and what exactly happens to make them cause

<!-- chunk -->

### other disorders? Alternatively, are some just different symptoms or phases

<!-- chunk -->

### of the same underlying problem? Is it like runny nose disorder and sore

<!-- chunk -->

### throat disorder—two seemingly different disorders that respond to different

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments but share the common pathway of inflammation? Is there a

<!-- chunk -->

### common pathway for mental disorders, even ones that appear to be

<!-- chunk -->

### profoundly different from each other?

# Taking a Deeper Look

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have been trying for decades to figure out what makes

<!-- chunk -->

### individual disorders different from each other at a biological level.

<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, they don’t yet have any clear answers. In fact, as I’m about to

<!-- chunk -->

### share with you, the research to date suggests that different disorders might

<!-- chunk -->

### not actually be all that different from each other, even though symptoms can

<!-- chunk -->

### vary widely.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at three of the psychotic disorders—schizophrenia,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### The primary feature of a schizophrenia diagnosis is chronic psychotic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, like hallucinations or paranoia. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### is given to people who primarily have mood symptoms—manic and

<!-- chunk -->

### depressive episodes. However, people with bipolar disorder also commonly

<!-- chunk -->

### have psychotic symptoms when they get manic, and even sometimes when

<!-- chunk -->

### they get depressed, but these psychotic symptoms go away after the mood

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms improve. Schizoaffective disorder is a diagnosis that includes

<!-- chunk -->

### features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, including chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic symptoms and prominent mood symptoms. Most people consider

<!-- chunk -->

### these disorders unequivocally “real.” Many in the field hold these disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### apart from things like depression and anxiety, sometimes calling these the

<!-- chunk -->

### “biological” disorders. So, what do we know about them? What makes

<!-- chunk -->

### them different from each other?

<!-- chunk -->

### A lot of money has been spent researching this question. The NIMH

<!-- chunk -->

### funded a multisite study called the Bipolar Schizophrenia Network on

<!-- chunk -->

### Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP). This study included more than 2,400

<!-- chunk -->

### people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder;

<!-- chunk -->

### their first-degree relatives; and people without these disorders (normal

<!-- chunk -->

### controls). The researchers examined key biological and behavioral

<!-- chunk -->

### measures, examining brain scans, genetic testing, EEGs, blood parameters,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation levels, and performance on a variety of cognitive tests. They

<!-- chunk -->

### found that people with the disorders were different from the normal

<!-- chunk -->

### controls, but they couldn’t tell any of the diagnostic groups apart from each

<!-- chunk -->

### other. In other words, there were abnormalities in the brains and bodies of

<!-- chunk -->

### people with these disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### but no significant differences at all between those with bipolar disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### those with schizoaffective disorder, or those with schizophrenia. If they are

<!-- chunk -->

### truly different disorders, how can that be?

<!-- chunk -->

### On the one hand, when we consider more information, maybe these

<!-- chunk -->

### findings aren’t so surprising after all. First, although the diagnosis of

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia isn’t supposed to include prominent mood symptoms, the

<!-- chunk -->

### reality is that one of the common features of schizophrenia is a group of

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms called negative symptoms. These include blunting of facial

<!-- chunk -->

### expressions, severely reduced speech and thought, losing interest in life

<!-- chunk -->

### (apathy), getting no pleasure from life or activities (anhedonia), reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### drive to interact with others, loss of motivation, and inattention to hygiene.

<!-- chunk -->

### You might notice significant overlap with the symptoms of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, DSM-5 specifically cautions clinicians against making the

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis of major depression in people with schizophrenia, even though

<!-- chunk -->

### many of these negative symptoms are the same symptoms found in

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Instead, clinicians are encouraged to diagnose a schizophrenia

<!-- chunk -->

### spectrum disorder. The implication is that even though the symptoms might

<!-- chunk -->

### overlap, we shouldn’t call them the same thing. Why not? Is there science

<!-- chunk -->

### to support that recommendation? In reality, the DSM-5 acknowledges in its

<!-- chunk -->

### introductory remarks that we don’t know what causes any of the psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses. Therefore, if people are having the same symptoms, how can we

<!-- chunk -->

### say they are not caused by the same process?

<!-- chunk -->

### The treatments for these disorders overlap as well—more than you

<!-- chunk -->

### might think. Mood stabilizers, such as lithium, Depakote, and Lamictal, are

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly used in bipolar disorder and have approval from the FDA for

<!-- chunk -->

### such use. However, about 34 percent of people diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia are also prescribed these same mood stabilizers, even though

<!-- chunk -->

### by definition, those with this diagnosis aren’t supposed to have significant

<!-- chunk -->

### mood symptoms.


<!-- chunk -->

### Antidepressants are also commonly used in both bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder and schizophrenia. Studies show that almost all bipolar patients

<!-- chunk -->

### receive an antidepressant at some point in their illness for their depressive

<!-- chunk -->

### episodes, and about 40 percent of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia do,

<!-- chunk -->

### too.


<!-- chunk -->

### And then there are the antipsychotic medications. These are used for

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, and are

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribed to treat all the symptoms of these disorders, not just the

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic ones. The FDA has even approved many of these medications

<!-- chunk -->

### both as “antipsychotics” and as “mood stabilizers” for the treatment of

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, while all of this suggests quite a bit of overlap

<!-- chunk -->

### between bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### also true that the symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia can be

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatically different. Many people with bipolar disorder never have

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic symptoms. Many are never hospitalized, and many function quite

<!-- chunk -->

### well in life. Meanwhile, almost all people with schizophrenia will

<!-- chunk -->

### experience severe impairment in functioning, with the majority qualifying

<!-- chunk -->

### as disabled.


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s not to say that there aren’t high-functioning

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenics, or that bipolar disorder can’t be disabling. In fact, one study

<!-- chunk -->

### that followed 146 people with bipolar disorder for almost thirteen years

<!-- chunk -->

### found that the people were symptomatically ill about 47 percent of the time

<!-- chunk -->

### despite treatment.


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s difficult to keep a job when you are ill almost half

<!-- chunk -->

### the time. But there are definite differences in the usual presentation of these

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses. Could it be that people with schizophrenia have a more severe

<!-- chunk -->

### form of the same illness, or one less responsive to our current treatments,

<!-- chunk -->

### while people with bipolar disorder may have a milder illness and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms that respond better to our treatments, resulting in episodes of

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery?

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Bruce Cuthbert, the acting director of the NIMH at the time of the

<!-- chunk -->

### B-SNIP study, suggested, “Just as fever or infection can have many

<!-- chunk -->

### different causes, multiple psychosis-causing disease processes—operating

<!-- chunk -->

### via different biological pathways—can lead to similar symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

### confounding the search for better care.”


<!-- chunk -->

### However, the study failed to find

<!-- chunk -->

### any hallmark biological markers to distinguish the diagnoses. What

<!-- chunk -->

### Cuthbert didn’t mention is that we know that fever is itself a symptom, with

<!-- chunk -->

### one clearly defined biological pathway—inflammation that triggers the

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothalamus to increase body temperature. However, there are many

<!-- chunk -->

### things that can trigger the inflammation, such as infections or allergic

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions. Diverse infections

<!-- chunk -->

### can have the same symptoms, through common pathways, even when the

<!-- chunk -->

### infectious agents (bacterial or viral) are different.

<!-- chunk -->

### It seems very plausible that the symptoms of bipolar disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia all share a common pathway as

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

# Sorting Out the Overlaps

<!-- chunk -->

### I have now suggested that bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizoaffective disorder are possibly the same illness, but on a spectrum of

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms and with different responses to existing treatments. Earlier in the

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter I suggested that major depression and anxiety disorders might be

<!-- chunk -->

### similarly related and share a common pathway. For many people in the

<!-- chunk -->

### field, neither of these assertions is difficult to grasp or believe. Mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health professionals have struggled with these distinctions for decades and

<!-- chunk -->

### know all too well about the overlap in these disorders and their treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, the overlap doesn’t stop with these conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms overlap between all kinds of mental diagnoses, not just those

<!-- chunk -->

### you would expect to be related. As I’ve mentioned, many different

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, both mental and medical, can lead to psychotic symptoms. In

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, about 10 percent of patients diagnosed with major depression will have

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic symptoms.


<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety symptoms are also common in multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses. The overall prevalence of anxiety disorders in the general

<!-- chunk -->

### population is quite high to begin with—in any given year, about 19 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### will experience an anxiety disorder. When looking at lifetime prevalence,

<!-- chunk -->

### that number rises to 33 percent, meaning that one out of three people will

<!-- chunk -->

### meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder at some point in their life.


<!-- chunk -->

### rates in people with depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizoaffective disorder are much higher—about double. Sometimes, we

<!-- chunk -->

### just rationalize these symptoms away: “Wouldn’t you be anxious if you had

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia?” As appealing and intuitive as this sounds, it’s not so

<!-- chunk -->

### simple. There is a strong bidirectional relationship between schizophrenia

<!-- chunk -->

### and anxiety disorders. In other words, people who first manifest an anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### have anywhere from an eight-to thirteen-fold increased risk of developing

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

### Those are not trivial increases.

<!-- chunk -->

### But why should this be?

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2005, Dr. Ronald Kessler and colleagues reported the results of the

<!-- chunk -->

### US National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a household survey that

<!-- chunk -->

### included a diagnostic interview of more than nine thousand representative

<!-- chunk -->

### people across the United States.


<!-- chunk -->

### Overall, 26 percent of people surveyed

<!-- chunk -->

### met criteria for a mental disorder in the last twelve months—that’s one in

<!-- chunk -->

### four Americans! Of those disorders, 22 percent were serious, 37 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### were moderate, and 40 percent were mild. Anxiety disorders were most

<!-- chunk -->

### common, followed by mood disorders, then impulse control disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### which include diagnoses like ADHD. Of note, 55 percent of people had

<!-- chunk -->

### only one diagnosis, 22 percent had two diagnoses, and the rest had three or

<!-- chunk -->

### more psychiatric diagnoses. That means almost half the people met criteria

<!-- chunk -->

### for more than one disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Diagnostic overlap is easier to dismiss when we are talking about

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety disorders, perhaps because anxiety is a mental state we all

<!-- chunk -->

### experience. So let’s look at autism spectrum disorder. Most people don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### think of autism as a purely “mental” illness, but more as a developmental or

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorder that starts early in life. Yet 70 percent of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### autism have at least one other mental disorder and almost 50 percent have

<!-- chunk -->

### two or more.


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s also interesting to note that embedded in the criteria of

<!-- chunk -->

### autism spectrum disorder are many of the symptoms of obsessive-

<!-- chunk -->

### compulsive disorder (OCD).

<!-- chunk -->

### And what happens to people with autism over longer terms? Are they at

<!-- chunk -->

### higher risk for developing additional mental disorders? Again, the answer is

<!-- chunk -->

### often yes. A prominent feature of autism is impairment in social skills, so it

<!-- chunk -->

### stands to reason that a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder could follow if

<!-- chunk -->

### interactions caused anxiety. In such a case, many would assume the autism

<!-- chunk -->

### spectrum disorder came first, and that the social anxiety was an

<!-- chunk -->

### understandable consequence of the autism. However, it’s now well

<!-- chunk -->

### documented that autism itself puts people at higher risk for developing

<!-- chunk -->

### every other type of mental disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

### This includes mood disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, behavioral disorders, eating disorders, and substance use

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. How can this be? Is it just that autism is stressful? We know that

<!-- chunk -->

### stress can put people at risk for all sorts of mental disorders, and having

<!-- chunk -->

### autism is undoubtedly stressful. But as you will learn, the explanation is

<!-- chunk -->

### much more complex than that.

<!-- chunk -->

### This phenomenon isn’t limited to anxiety disorders or autism spectrum

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, either. Looking at eating disorders, bulimia nervosa occurs in

<!-- chunk -->

### about 1 percent of the population, anorexia nervosa in about 0.6 percent,

<!-- chunk -->

### and binge eating disorder (the newest disorder in the category) in about

<!-- chunk -->

### percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many people consider these societal disorders rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### biological brain disorders. Yet overall, 56 percent of people with anorexia,

<!-- chunk -->

### 79 percent of people with binge eating disorder, and 95 percent of people

<!-- chunk -->

### with bulimia have at least one other mental disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

### So here we go again

<!-- chunk -->

### —which one comes first? Do eating disorders cause other mental disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### or do other disorders cause eating disorders? Both: There is a bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship between eating disorders and other mental disorders. Which

<!-- chunk -->

### other disorders, you ask? All of them. The same is true of addiction. Again,

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s a bidirectional relationship. People with any substance use disorder are

<!-- chunk -->

### at higher risk of developing a mental disorder, and people with mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders are at much higher risk of using and abusing addictive substances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why is that?

<!-- chunk -->

### I could go on this way, diagnosis by diagnosis, but I won’t—an

<!-- chunk -->

### important 2019 study clarifies the bigger picture. In this study, researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### used a Danish health registry to analyze psychiatric diagnoses in almost six

<!-- chunk -->

### million people over seventeen years.


<!-- chunk -->

### What they found was that having

<!-- chunk -->

### any mental disorder dramatically increased the chances of that person later

<!-- chunk -->

### developing another mental disorder. There were strong bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships for everything! Even disorders that most people think are

<!-- chunk -->

### completely unrelated—schizophrenia and eating disorders, intellectual

<!-- chunk -->

### disability and schizophrenia. Mix and match them however you like. The

<!-- chunk -->

### odds ratios across the board in this study were generally between two and

<!-- chunk -->

### thirty. This means that if you were diagnosed with any mental disorder, you

<!-- chunk -->

### were two to thirty times more likely to later be diagnosed with another

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorder. Which one? Any of them! While some of the very high

<!-- chunk -->

### odds ratios are due

<!-- chunk -->

### to overlap in symptoms between different disorders, the point is that the

<!-- chunk -->

### odds ratios were elevated for all disorders in all directions.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s more, this bidirectional relationship also applied to mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders and so-called “organic” mental disorders. “Organic mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder” is the term used to refer to symptoms of a mental disorder that are

<!-- chunk -->

### thought to be caused by a medical condition or a medication. We discussed

<!-- chunk -->

### this briefly earlier: For example, if someone with cancer loses their appetite

<!-- chunk -->

### and gets depressed, they often are not diagnosed with major depression. The

<!-- chunk -->

### assumption is that these symptoms are due to the cancer, and not a true

<!-- chunk -->

### “mental” disorder. Yet the evidence of this study now shows that if people

<!-- chunk -->

### develop “mental” symptoms attributed to a medical problem, they are then

<!-- chunk -->

### much more likely to develop a mental disorder in the future—and vice

<!-- chunk -->

### versa. This finding certainly raises the question of whether separating

<!-- chunk -->

### “organic” mental disorders from the rest really makes sense.

<!-- chunk -->

### All told, this study raised several important questions. Bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, especially ones that are particularly strong in both directions,

<!-- chunk -->

### suggest a common pathway does exist. While the symptoms may differ,

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps our diagnoses are far more similar than we’ve long thought.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Danish study wasn’t the first piece of scholarship to suggest all

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders might share one common pathway. In 2012, Dr. Benjamin

<!-- chunk -->

### Lahey and colleagues studied the symptoms and prognosis of eleven

<!-- chunk -->

### different mental disorders in thirty thousand people.


<!-- chunk -->

### They looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### “internalizing” versus “externalizing” disorders. Internalizing disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### ones in which distress is thought to be directed inward, such as depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and anxiety disorders. Externalizing ones are when distress is outwardly

<!-- chunk -->

### directed, such as substance use disorders or antisocial behavior. They found

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendous overlap in these different disorders and raised the possibility of

<!-- chunk -->

### a “general factor” leading to all of them.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2018, doctors Avshalom Caspi and Terrie Moffitt took this research

<!-- chunk -->

### further by including all mental disorders in a review article, “All for One

<!-- chunk -->

### and One for All: Mental Disorders in One Dimension.”


<!-- chunk -->

### They reviewed a

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendous amount of research, including epidemiological studies, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### imaging studies, and studies of known risk factors for mental disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### such

<!-- chunk -->

### as genetics and childhood trauma. The data was exhaustive, encompassing

<!-- chunk -->

### research on people of different ages, including children, adolescents, and

<!-- chunk -->

### adults, and from many different parts of the world. After examining all this

<!-- chunk -->

### data, they found strong correlations among all mental disorders. When they

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at risk factors for mental disorders, they found that not one risk

<!-- chunk -->

### factor conferred risk only for a specific disorder—instead, each and every

<!-- chunk -->

### risk factor conferred risk for many. For example, one study they examined

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at the genetics of psychiatric disorders.


<!-- chunk -->

### The study evaluated more

<!-- chunk -->

### than three million siblings, hoping to identify which genes conferred risk

<!-- chunk -->

### for depression, anxiety, ADHD, alcoholism, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizoaffective disorder. Given that these are all different disorders, one

<!-- chunk -->

### would expect them to have different associated genes. However, the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers found that most of the genetic variations conferred risk for a

<!-- chunk -->

### broad range of disorders. There were no genes that were specific to only

<!-- chunk -->

### one disorder. Even childhood abuse confers risk for most mental disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### including PTSD, depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, eating

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### Given the never-ending overlap in correlations among all mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders and all of their risk factors, Caspi and Moffitt used a complex

<!-- chunk -->

### mathematical model to analyze these correlations in the hope of making

<!-- chunk -->

### sense of them. This model offered a shocking conclusion. It suggested that

<!-- chunk -->

### there appears to be one common pathway to all mental illnesses. Caspi and

<!-- chunk -->

### Moffitt called it the p-factor, in which the p stands for general

<!-- chunk -->

### psychopathology. They argued that this factor appears to predict a person’s

<!-- chunk -->

### liability to develop a mental disorder, to have more than one disorder, to

<!-- chunk -->

### have a chronic disorder, and it can even predict the severity of symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### This p-factor is common to hundreds of different psychiatric symptoms and

<!-- chunk -->

### every psychiatric diagnosis. Subsequent research using different sets of

<!-- chunk -->

### people and different methods confirmed the existence of this p-factor.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, this research was not designed to tell us what the p-factor is. It

<!-- chunk -->

### only suggests that it exists—that there is an unidentified variable that plays

<!-- chunk -->

### a role in all mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our job is to figure out what it could be.

# W


# Could It All Be Related?

<!-- chunk -->

### hat if I told you this common pathway that we’re searching for

<!-- chunk -->

### might not be limited to mental health conditions?

<!-- chunk -->

### As we’ve seen, the medical field currently separates mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders from other medical disorders. They are viewed as separate

<!-- chunk -->

### categories that have little to nothing to do with each other.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there are many medical disorders that commonly co-occur with

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders and vice versa. Yes—here we go again with bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships: Not only do mental disorders have strong bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships with one another, many metabolic and neurological disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### also have strong bidirectional relationships with mental disorders. These

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships provide important clues about the nature of the common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway that will help us solve the puzzle of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### To explore these relationships, I’m going to focus on three metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) and two neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders (Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy). All five of these conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### are commonly associated with mental symptoms like depression, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, and even psychosis. On the flip side, people who have mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders are at much higher risk of developing these five medical

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Clearly not all people with these medical disorders have a mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, and not all people with a mental illness develop any of these

<!-- chunk -->

### medical disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### When patients with one of these medical conditions do have mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness symptoms, they’re sometimes overlooked as normal reactions to

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult diseases. Those with heart failure are often depressed, which is

<!-- chunk -->

### presented as understandable given the severity of heart failure. And whether

<!-- chunk -->

### people with these conditions who are experiencing mental symptoms get

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with a “mental” disorder is up to clinicians, who have the

<!-- chunk -->

### discretion to attribute these mental symptoms to the “organic” illnesses. In

<!-- chunk -->

### the end, though, the symptoms are the same regardless of what cause they

<!-- chunk -->

### are attributed to. Depression is the same. Anxiety is the same. Paranoia is

<!-- chunk -->

### the same. The treatments are the same as well: antidepressants, anti-anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### medications, and antipsychotics are all commonly used in people with these

<!-- chunk -->

### “organic” disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Looking at these disorders more closely will illuminate the connections

<!-- chunk -->

### between metabolism, metabolic disorders, and disorders of the brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### whether mental or neurological. They will help us put the final pieces of the

<!-- chunk -->

### puzzle in place.

# Metabolic Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start with our three metabolic disorders: obesity, diabetes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular disease. The term “metabolic disorders” actually includes

<!-- chunk -->

### many more disorders, but it most commonly refers to disorders associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with metabolic syndrome. This is a syndrome that is diagnosed when people

<!-- chunk -->

### have three or more of the following conditions: increased blood pressure,

<!-- chunk -->

### high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, high triglycerides, and

<!-- chunk -->

### low HDL (or “good cholesterol”). People with metabolic syndrome are at

<!-- chunk -->

### increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### The connection between diabetes and mental illness has been known for

<!-- chunk -->

### more than a century. In 1879, Sir Henry Maudsley wrote, “Diabetes is a

<!-- chunk -->

### disease that often shows itself in families in which insanity prevails.” Many

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders are associated with higher rates of diabetes. People with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia are three times more likely to develop diabetes.


<!-- chunk -->

### People

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed with depression are 60 percent more likely to develop diabetes.


<!-- chunk -->

### What about the other way around? Are people with diabetes more likely

<!-- chunk -->

### to develop mental disorders? Yes. Most of the research has focused on

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and diabetes. People with diabetes are two to three times more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to develop major depression. Furthermore, when they get depressed,

<!-- chunk -->

### the depression lasts four times longer than it does in those without diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### At any given time, about one in four people with diabetes has clinically

<!-- chunk -->

### significant depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### What’s more, the depression appears to affect

<!-- chunk -->

### blood-glucose levels—diabetics with depression tend to have higher

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose readings than those without depression. However, it’s not just

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. One study of 1.3 million adolescents looked at rates of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness over the following ten years. Adolescents with diabetes were more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to suffer from a mood disorder, attempt suicide, visit a psychiatrist, or

<!-- chunk -->

### develop any psychiatric disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

## Obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that people with mental disorders are more likely to be

<!-- chunk -->

### overweight or obese. One study followed people diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for twenty years. When they were first

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosed, the majority were not obese. Twenty years later, 62 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### those with schizophrenia and 50 percent of those with bipolar disorder were

<!-- chunk -->

### obese.


<!-- chunk -->

### The obesity rate at the time for all adults in New York State, where

<!-- chunk -->

### the study was conducted, was 27 percent. Children with autism are

<!-- chunk -->

### percent more likely to be obese.


<!-- chunk -->

### One meta-analysis of 120 studies found

<!-- chunk -->

### that people with serious mental illness were three times more likely to be

<!-- chunk -->

### obese than people without a mental illness.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many people assume that our treatments are causing this obesity. While

<!-- chunk -->

### there’s no doubt that psychiatric medications are associated with weight

<!-- chunk -->

### gain—in fact it’s a common side effect of antidepressants and

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotics—treatments alone don’t provide the entire explanation. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, one study looked at people with ADHD who were either treated or

<!-- chunk -->

### not treated with medications, and then it assessed their rates of obesity over

<!-- chunk -->

### the ensuing years compared to people without ADHD. They found that all

<!-- chunk -->

### people with ADHD, whether treated or not, were more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity. Even though the primary treatment for ADHD is usually a

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant medication, which generally suppresses appetite, the people with

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD who were treated with stimulants were still more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity than those without ADHD. Those who didn’t take stimulants were

<!-- chunk -->

### even more likely to become obese.


<!-- chunk -->

### What about people who are obese? Are they more likely to develop a

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorder? Again, the answer is yes. People who are obese are

<!-- chunk -->

### percent more likely to develop depression or an anxiety disorder and

<!-- chunk -->

### percent more likely to develop bipolar disorder. One study found that

<!-- chunk -->

### weight gain around the time of puberty was associated with a fourfold

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in the risk of depression by age twenty-four.


<!-- chunk -->

### Obesity has been

<!-- chunk -->

### found to affect brain function in ways known to lead to mental disorders as

<!-- chunk -->

### well. For example, people with obesity have been found to have altered

<!-- chunk -->

### connections between brain regions as well as alterations in a region of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain called the hypothalamus


<!-- chunk -->

### that are common in people with mental


<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### Cardiovascular diseases—particularly heart attacks and strokes—also have

<!-- chunk -->

### bidirectional relationships with mental disorders. Again looking at

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, we find that 20 percent of people with heart attacks, 33 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### with congestive heart failure, and 31 percent with strokes experience major

<!-- chunk -->

### depression within a year of the event or condition.


<!-- chunk -->

### These rates of

<!-- chunk -->

### occurrence are three to five times higher than those in the US population as

<!-- chunk -->

### a whole.

<!-- chunk -->

### This seems easy to understand on the surface. Most people would be

<!-- chunk -->

### worried or depressed following a traumatic event like a heart attack or

<!-- chunk -->

### stroke. However, we’re witnessing another bidirectional relationship,

<!-- chunk -->

### suggesting this is more than just a psychological reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that depression affects the heart. In people who have never

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered a heart attack, experiencing major depression increases the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### having a future heart attack by 50 to 100 percent.


<!-- chunk -->

### In people who have

<!-- chunk -->

### already suffered a heart attack, being depressed doubles the chances that

<!-- chunk -->

### they’ll have another heart attack in the next year.

<!-- chunk -->

### And it doesn’t stop with depression. People diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are 53 percent more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### premature cardiovascular disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is even after controlling for risk

<!-- chunk -->

### factors like obesity and diabetes. A thirteen-year study of almost one

<!-- chunk -->

### million veterans found that individuals who were diagnosed with PTSD

<!-- chunk -->

### were twice as likely to have a transient ischemic attack (temporary

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of a stroke) and 62 percent more likely to have a stroke.


<!-- chunk -->

### We’ve long known that people with serious mental disorders such as

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe chronic depression die at a much

<!-- chunk -->

### younger age than they should. On average, they lose between thirteen and

<!-- chunk -->

### thirty years from their normal lifespans.


<!-- chunk -->

### Recent research from a Danish

<!-- chunk -->

### population database of more than seven million people suggests something

<!-- chunk -->

### more alarming.


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s not just the “serious” mental disorders that result in a

<!-- chunk -->

### shortened lifespan. All mental disorders—even mild or common ones, like

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety disorders or ADHD—are associated with shortened lifespans. On

<!-- chunk -->

### average, men with mental disorders lose ten years of life and women lose

<!-- chunk -->

### seven.

<!-- chunk -->

### What are these people dying from so early? Most think suicide is

<!-- chunk -->

### responsible, but it’s not. Although suicide rates are definitely higher in the

<!-- chunk -->

### mentally ill, the early deaths in this group are primarily due to heart attacks,

<!-- chunk -->

### strokes, and diabetes—metabolic disorders. We have just seen that people

<!-- chunk -->

### with mental disorders have much higher rates of these conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even before they die, we now know that people with chronic mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders appear to be aging prematurely. We can see this through a variety

<!-- chunk -->

### of metrics of the aging process. One such metric is the length of telomeres,

<!-- chunk -->

### which are the end caps of chromosomes. They tend to get shorter

<!-- chunk -->

### as people age. Shortened telomeres have been found in people with diseases

<!-- chunk -->

### that you would expect to be associated with aging, such as obesity, cancer,

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. They have also been found to be

<!-- chunk -->

### shorter in people with depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and substance

<!-- chunk -->

### use disorders.


# Neurological Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### Even though both neurological and mental disorders affect the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### both commonly include “mental” symptoms, they are distinguished based

<!-- chunk -->

### on one thing: Neurological disorders have at least one objective test or

<!-- chunk -->

### pathological finding that can be used in diagnosing the disorder. This can be

<!-- chunk -->

### an abnormality on a brain scan or EEG, or it can be a specific pathological

<!-- chunk -->

### finding in brain tissue or the fluid surrounding the brain. As I’ve already

<!-- chunk -->

### shared with you, mental disorders have no objective tests that can be used

<!-- chunk -->

### in diagnosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, which is a

<!-- chunk -->

### group of neurological disorders that impair brain function over time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Common symptoms of all dementias include memory disturbances, changes

<!-- chunk -->

### in personality, and compromised judgment. The hallmark findings in

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease are plaques and tangles in the brain. As people get

<!-- chunk -->

### older, their risk for Alzheimer’s goes up exponentially, doubling every five

<!-- chunk -->

### years after sixty-five. By age eighty-five, about 33 percent of all people will

<!-- chunk -->

### have Alzheimer’s disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### There are types of early-onset Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease that can be caused by rare genetic mutations or Down’s syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, for everyone else, it’s not clear exactly what causes it. Besides

<!-- chunk -->

### age, some of the known risk factors include a family history of the disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### head trauma . . . and metabolic disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Obesity in midlife, diabetes, and heart disease all increase the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### developing Alzheimer’s. So do the risk factors for metabolic disorders, like

<!-- chunk -->

### smoking cigarettes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise. Interestingly, one of the genetic risk factors involves a gene

<!-- chunk -->

### variant called APOE4—which codes for an enzyme related to fat and

<!-- chunk -->

### cholesterol metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Things often considered to be “mental” are also risk factors. Having

<!-- chunk -->

### depression earlier in life doubles a person’s chances of developing

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### Schizophrenia dramatically increases the chances,

<!-- chunk -->

### too—one study of more than eight million people found that if someone

<!-- chunk -->

### with schizophrenia lives to the relatively young age of sixty-six, they are

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those without

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia.


<!-- chunk -->

### And remember that large study of the Danish population

<!-- chunk -->

### that found bidirectional relationships among all the different psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders? Alzheimer’s disease was included under the category of organic

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, the label used to classify mental symptoms due to medical

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions, such as delirium and other types of dementia. In that study,

<!-- chunk -->

### every psychiatric disorder increased the chances of developing an organic

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorder—anywhere from a 50 percent increase up to a twentyfold

<!-- chunk -->

### increase. Unfortunately, Alzheimer’s disease wasn’t separated from the

<!-- chunk -->

### other organic mental illnesses, but the two most common organic mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders are delirium and Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first signs of Alzheimer’s disease are usually forgetfulness and

<!-- chunk -->

### “mental” symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, or personality changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once Alzheimer’s is diagnosed, almost all patients will develop psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms—97 percent in one study.


<!-- chunk -->

### These can include just about any you

<!-- chunk -->

### can think of—anxiety, depression, personality changes, agitation, insomnia,

<!-- chunk -->

### social withdrawal, you name it. About 50 percent of Alzheimer’s patients

<!-- chunk -->

### will develop psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, essentially every psychiatric symptom can emerge with Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. If that’s the case, what’s causing these symptoms? Is it the same

<!-- chunk -->

### cause as in people who develop mental symptoms and disorders earlier in

<!-- chunk -->

### life? One thing is certain: this overlap of identical symptoms means we

<!-- chunk -->

### can’t truly address the question of what causes mental illness without

<!-- chunk -->

### looking at Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### Epilepsy is a relatively rare brain disorder that also has a bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship with mental disorders. Epilepsy can begin at any age, but it

<!-- chunk -->

### most often begins in childhood, affecting about one in 150 children.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the cause is due to a clearly identified brain abnormality, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### a stroke, brain injury, tumor, or a rare genetic mutation. For most, however,

<!-- chunk -->

### the cause is unknown.

<!-- chunk -->

### People with epilepsy often have psychiatric symptoms. Sometimes these

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms lead to a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Other times, however,

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms are assumed to be due to the seizures themselves. There is no

<!-- chunk -->

### question that seizures can produce emotions, sensations, or behaviors that

<!-- chunk -->

### are unusual. However, people with epilepsy are also more likely to

<!-- chunk -->

### experience mental symptoms even when they are not seizing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Twenty to forty percent of children with epilepsy also have an

<!-- chunk -->

### intellectual disability, ADHD, or autism diagnosis.


<!-- chunk -->

### Anxiety disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### also common in those with epilepsy, occurring at a three- to sixfold higher

<!-- chunk -->

### rate compared to the general population.


<!-- chunk -->

### One study found that 55 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of people with epilepsy suffered depression, with one-third of all epileptics

<!-- chunk -->

### reporting at least one suicide attempt.


<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, the suicide attempts

<!-- chunk -->

### often occurred before the epilepsy diagnosis.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other studies have found a

<!-- chunk -->

### sixfold increase in bipolar disorder and a ninefold increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia.


<!-- chunk -->

### The data make clear that psychiatric diagnoses—across the

<!-- chunk -->

### board—are extraordinarily common with epilepsy.

<!-- chunk -->

### What about the other way around? Indeed, it appears that people with

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders are more likely to have epilepsy or experience seizures in

<!-- chunk -->

### general. Anywhere between 6 to 27 percent of children with autism will

<!-- chunk -->

### develop seizures.


<!-- chunk -->

### Signs of epilepsy show up on the EEGs of 16 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### children with ADHD.


<!-- chunk -->

### Additionally, children who have seizures are two

<!-- chunk -->

### and a half times more likely to already be diagnosed with ADHD.


<!-- chunk -->

### Later

<!-- chunk -->

### in life, a diagnosis of major depression increases the chances of having an

<!-- chunk -->

### unprovoked seizure sixfold.


<!-- chunk -->

### Seizures offer us an important clue on the way to our common pathway,

<!-- chunk -->

### further connecting the dots between metabolic, mental, and neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders: not only is there a relationship between epilepsy and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, there is a relationship between epilepsy and metabolic disorders as

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ve long known that hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures. This is commonly seen in diabetics—both types 1 and 2. Diabetics

<!-- chunk -->

### can get low blood sugar from either too much medication or not eating

<!-- chunk -->

### enough. However, are people with diabetes more likely to have seizures

<!-- chunk -->

### unrelated to severe hypoglycemia? Yes. Children with type 1 diabetes are

<!-- chunk -->

### three times more likely to develop epilepsy


<!-- chunk -->

### —six times more likely if the

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes begins before age six.


<!-- chunk -->

### Adults sixty-five and over with type

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes were found to have a 50 percent higher chance of developing

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy.


<!-- chunk -->

### What about obesity? You might think weight has nothing to do with

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy, and yet a large study showed that people who are extremely

<!-- chunk -->

### underweight or overweight were 60 to 70 percent more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy than people of a normal weight.


<!-- chunk -->

### That both being over- and

<!-- chunk -->

### underweight are risk factors may be a surprise, but as I’ll explain later, both

<!-- chunk -->

### extremes are stressful to metabolism. Additionally, women who are obese

<!-- chunk -->

### during pregnancy are more likely to give birth to children who go on to

<!-- chunk -->

### develop epilepsy, with rates increasing as the mothers get heavier. Women

<!-- chunk -->

### with a BMI greater than 40 have an 82 percent higher risk of having

<!-- chunk -->

### children with epilepsy—almost double the risk in the general population.


# Hiding in Plain Sight

<!-- chunk -->

### So here we are, faced with the curious fact that mental disorders have

<!-- chunk -->

### bidirectional relationships not only with each other, but with these

<!-- chunk -->

### seemingly very different medical disorders as well. Recall that bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships suggest a possible common pathway—something in common

<!-- chunk -->

### that is causing or contributing to all these disorders. Is that possible?

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people think they already know the reason for some of these

<!-- chunk -->

### connections, especially those between metabolic and mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ve talked about the stigma around mental disorders, but when it

<!-- chunk -->

### comes to metabolic disorders, people are often quick to judge as well. They

<!-- chunk -->

### think those who are obese, diabetic, or have heart attacks are simply not

<!-- chunk -->

### taking good care of themselves. They eat too much, smoke, and/or don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise enough. By and large, many believe these conditions arise from

<!-- chunk -->

### negligence—that they’re the fault of the diagnosed. Similarly, it seems

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious to many that mental disorders cause people to not take good care of

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves. For instance, depression causes people to lose energy and

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation. When that happens, they sit around all day, watch TV, and eat.

<!-- chunk -->

### They gain weight. They don’t exercise. Everyone knows that “stress”

<!-- chunk -->

### contributes to unhealthy habits. Almost by definition, people with mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders have more stress than most, or at least it feels that way to them.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, again, people with these stressful symptoms eat poorly and don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise enough. It’s no wonder that people with mental disorders have

<!-- chunk -->

### higher rates of metabolic disorders. What it really comes down to, in the

<!-- chunk -->

### eyes of many, is simple—these are issues of willpower and discipline.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s the conundrum, though. The rates of all these disorders have

<!-- chunk -->

### been skyrocketing over the past fifty years. Obesity, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular disease, and mental disorders. Why is that? Have we had an

<!-- chunk -->

### epidemic of laziness or self-destructive health behaviors in our society? Are

<!-- chunk -->

### people no longer capable of self-discipline? Do they just not care about

<!-- chunk -->

### their health? If you would answer “yes” to these questions, which many

<!-- chunk -->

### would, another question remains: Why? What has caused this “epidemic of

<!-- chunk -->

### laziness”?

<!-- chunk -->

### As we touched on in Chapter One, some might say it’s society. The

<!-- chunk -->

### faster pace of everything and the demands of that pace. The stress of

<!-- chunk -->

### modern life. Constant emails to attend to. Social media posts stacking up

<!-- chunk -->

### and vying for our attention. The pull to pick up your cell phone and always

<!-- chunk -->

### be watching, searching, scrolling, or checking. Others might say it’s the

<!-- chunk -->

### food supply—artificial ingredients and processed foods.

<!-- chunk -->

### As it turns out, these are likely contributing factors, but are they true

<!-- chunk -->

### causes? How do we get from any one of these “causes” to laziness, apathy,

<!-- chunk -->

### and burnout, which then cause people to overeat and not exercise, which

<!-- chunk -->

### then cause them to develop mental or metabolic disorders? How does that

<!-- chunk -->

### all actually work in the body and brain? And why doesn’t everyone subject

<!-- chunk -->

### to these forces end up diabetic and depressed? And where do the

<!-- chunk -->

### connections with neurological disorders, acknowledged as physical brain

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases, fit into all this talk of modern life and poor health habits? While

<!-- chunk -->

### most people think these mental and metabolic relationships are easy to

<!-- chunk -->

### explain, when you get down to the specifics of human physiology, things

<!-- chunk -->

### get significantly murkier.

<!-- chunk -->

### When providers talk to people about changing their health behaviors—

<!-- chunk -->

### eating less or exercising more—they often get similar answers: “It’s too

<!-- chunk -->

### hard,” or, “I don’t have enough energy.” These answers are almost always

<!-- chunk -->

### met with strong disapproval. They are viewed as excuses for laziness, or

<!-- chunk -->

### signs of not taking the issue seriously enough, or of a lack of discipline. But

<!-- chunk -->

### is it possible that instead of being excuses, answers like “It’s too hard” and

<!-- chunk -->

### “I don’t have enough energy” are actually clues giving us important

<!-- chunk -->

### information? Could inertia and lack of motivation be symptoms of a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problem? Is it possible that these people literally don’t have

<!-- chunk -->

### enough energy?

<!-- chunk -->

### As it turns out, it’s not just possible; there’s an abundance of evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### that it’s true. You see, metabolism involves the production of energy inside

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. As you’ll see in the coming chapters, people who have metabolic or

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illnesses have been found to have deficits in energy production

<!-- chunk -->

### inside their cells. These people are telling the truth. They really don’t have

<!-- chunk -->

### enough energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s not a motivational problem. It’s a metabolic one.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have been missing the elephant in the room.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s do a quick recap.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I’ve described the current state of affairs in the mental health field

<!-- chunk -->

### and why what we’re doing isn’t working.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I’ve explored evidence about the overlap and commonalities among

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, as well as the limits of our current methods of

<!-- chunk -->

### differentiating between diagnoses. We’ve seen that every

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorder leads to a much greater probability of developing

<!-- chunk -->

### another mental disorder—any one of them. These bidirectional

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships suggest that one common pathway might be involved in

<!-- chunk -->

### all mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### •I have also explored the evidence of bidirectional relationships

<!-- chunk -->

### between mental disorders and at least three metabolic and at least two

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorders: obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. This raises the possibility of one

<!-- chunk -->

### common pathway not just for mental disorders, but for all of these


<!-- chunk -->

### Already, this may seem impossible to reconcile. You might be yelling,

<!-- chunk -->

### “But these are all different diseases!" Schizophrenia is not the same thing as

<!-- chunk -->

### an eating disorder or a mild anxiety disorder. Cardiovascular disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder, epilepsy, diabetes, and depression are all different. They

<!-- chunk -->

### have different symptoms. They affect different parts of the body. They

<!-- chunk -->

### appear at different ages. Some of them, like a stroke, can kill people

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly. Others, like mild depression that lasts only a few months, might

<!-- chunk -->

### come and go away without any intervention.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s difficult to imagine that all these disorders share one common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway. If there is such a common pathway, it will have to be involved in

<!-- chunk -->

### many different aspects of how the body works. It will need to tie together

<!-- chunk -->

### everything that we already know about these different disorders—their risk

<!-- chunk -->

### factors and symptoms, the treatments that work. That’s a huge role for any

<!-- chunk -->

### bodily process or function to fill.

<!-- chunk -->

### As you will see in Part Two, metabolism fills this role.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yes: we have arrived at our common thread, the underpinning factor

<!-- chunk -->

### that lets us answer our tangled questions about causes and treatments,

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms and overlaps.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental disorders—all of them—are metabolic disorders of the brain.

# Part II

# Brain Energy


# Mental Disorders Are Metabolic

# Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### he following 1938 observation from physicists Albert Einstein and

<!-- chunk -->

### Leopold Infeld is critically important:

<!-- chunk -->

### Creating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and

<!-- chunk -->

### erecting a skyscraper in its place. It is rather like climbing a

<!-- chunk -->

### mountain, gaining new and wider views, discovering unexpected

<!-- chunk -->

### connections between our starting point and its rich environment. But

<!-- chunk -->

### the point from which we started out still exists and can be seen,

<!-- chunk -->

### although it appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad view

<!-- chunk -->

### gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous way up.


<!-- chunk -->

### For any new theory to be taken seriously, it must incorporate what we

<!-- chunk -->

### already know to be true. It can’t just replace it; it must tie together our

<!-- chunk -->

### existing knowledge and experience into a broader understanding—one that

<!-- chunk -->

### will widen our perspective and offer new insights.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental health professionals have various camps at the base of Einstein and

<!-- chunk -->

### Infeld’s mountain. Some believe mental illnesses are biologically based,

<!-- chunk -->

### that they arise from a chemical imbalance. They prescribe medications and

<!-- chunk -->

### have seen them work. Other professionals are focused on psychological and

<!-- chunk -->

### social issues. They have helped people through psychotherapy and social

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions and have seen these treatments work. They know with

<!-- chunk -->

### certainty that at least some mental disorders involve psychological and

<!-- chunk -->

### social issues; correcting these issues without any pills can solve the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem, at least for some patients. In reality, all these perspectives are

<!-- chunk -->

### correct. That this is so—and how it is so—can be seen clearly from the

<!-- chunk -->

### vantage point of our new theory: the theory of brain energy. This theory is

<!-- chunk -->

### based on one overarching concept—mental disorders are metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders of the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the medical world, new theories allow us to better understand the

<!-- chunk -->

### connections between treatments and disorders that we currently can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### explain. They help us better predict future research findings. And they help

<!-- chunk -->

### us develop more effective treatments for the future. The theory of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### energy will do all of this for mental disorders. But its impact is bigger than

<!-- chunk -->

### just mental health. This theory ties together medical disciplines that most

<!-- chunk -->

### people think are unrelated—psychiatry, neurology, cardiology, and

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrinology. Others, too. All these disciplines have their own camps at

<!-- chunk -->

### the base of the mountain as well. Sometimes they work with each other and

<!-- chunk -->

### the practitioners see the connections between disciplines, but far too often,

<!-- chunk -->

### they don’t. A patient might visit a cardiologist who prescribes their heart

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, an endocrinologist who manages their diabetes prescriptions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### a psychiatrist who prescribes medication for bipolar disorder, with these

<!-- chunk -->

### specialists never communicating with each other. I’m hopeful that the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### energy theory will change this, leading to better cross-specialty

<!-- chunk -->

### collaboration and more effective and comprehensive care. Given what

<!-- chunk -->

### we’ve already seen about the connections between these disorders, this kind

<!-- chunk -->

### of communication and collaboration seems only logical. It may soon be

<!-- chunk -->

### possible to treat or prevent all of these conditions with one integrated

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment plan.

<!-- chunk -->

### In order to prove, or at least strongly support, the theory of brain energy, the

<!-- chunk -->

### upcoming chapters will show that:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Metabolic abnormalities have consistently been found in people with

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, even those who don’t yet have the already-

<!-- chunk -->

### recognized metabolic disorders of obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Essentially all the risk factors for mental and metabolic disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### the same. The list includes biological, psychological, and social

<!-- chunk -->

### factors, ranging from things like diet and exercise, smoking, drug and

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol use, and sleep . . . to hormones, inflammation, genetics,

<!-- chunk -->

### epigenetics, and the gut microbiome. The list also extends to

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, love, having meaning and purpose in life, and stress

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. You can isolate any one of these factors and see that it’s been

<!-- chunk -->

### found to increase risk for both metabolic and mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Every one of these risk factors can be tied directly to metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### •All the symptoms of mental disorders can be tied directly to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, or more specifically, mitochondria, which are the master

<!-- chunk -->

### regulators of metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### •All current treatments in the mental health field, including

<!-- chunk -->

### biological, psychological, and social interventions, likely work by

<!-- chunk -->

### affecting metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### As we explore these lines of evidence, not only will it become clear that

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders are indeed metabolic disorders of the brain, it will become

<!-- chunk -->

### clear why this is important and what it means for treatment.

# The Metabolic Ripple Effect

<!-- chunk -->

### To suggest that so many different disorders stem from metabolic problems

<!-- chunk -->

### may sound far-fetched. Interestingly enough, while the medical field now

<!-- chunk -->

### groups obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease together as metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, that was not always the case. After all, they have very different

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, and they require different medications and different treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are still different specialties that focus on these different disorders—

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity medicine (obesity), endocrinology (diabetes), cardiology (heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks), and neurology (strokes). However, they all affect the entire body,

<!-- chunk -->

### and people who have one such disorder are at higher risk of having another

<!-- chunk -->

### one. Not everyone who is obese has a heart attack or diabetes. Not all

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetics are obese. Not all people who have a stroke have diabetes. But

<!-- chunk -->

### while different people have different signs and symptoms, they are all

<!-- chunk -->

### interconnected.

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of metabolic disorders on the body aren’t limited to an

<!-- chunk -->

### increased risk of the other metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks, and strokes. As we’ve already discussed, these people have

<!-- chunk -->

### increased rates of Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and mental problems, too.

<!-- chunk -->

### But people with metabolic disorders are also more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### innumerable other illnesses not usually viewed as metabolic. These include

<!-- chunk -->

### liver problems, kidney problems, nerve problems, brain problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### hormonal problems, joint problems, gastrointestinal problems, autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, and even cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people think that metabolic disorders are simple problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### simple solutions. They think they know the “root causes” of these disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### —behaviors like eating too much, not exercising enough, and/or smoking

<!-- chunk -->

### cigarettes. As long as people don’t overeat, or under-exercise, or smoke,

<!-- chunk -->

### they will be perfectly fine, metabolically speaking. See? Simple.

<!-- chunk -->

### But when it comes to metabolism, nothing is simple.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s look at an example. Mark was a seemingly healthy, thin, and fit

<!-- chunk -->

### forty-five-year-old man who developed multiple sclerosis (MS), an

<!-- chunk -->

### autoimmune disorder. To treat his MS, he was prescribed a medication

<!-- chunk -->

### called prednisone, a corticosteroid. Within weeks, he was bloated and

<!-- chunk -->

### gaining

<!-- chunk -->

### weight. Within a month, he developed pre-diabetes and was prescribed a

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes medication. Unfortunately, weight gain and high blood sugar are

<!-- chunk -->

### both known side effects of prednisone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the next six months, Mark gained forty pounds. Not all of this

<!-- chunk -->

### weight came out of nowhere; his behavior—specifically, his diet and

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise routine—changed dramatically. Up until his diagnosis, he had

<!-- chunk -->

### always eaten well and exercised vigorously several times a week. But

<!-- chunk -->

### corticosteroids like prednisone are known to increase appetite, and Mark

<!-- chunk -->

### had started craving and eating a lot of junk food, something he’d never

<!-- chunk -->

### done before. He tried to keep up with his exercise routine, but as he gained

<!-- chunk -->

### weight, it became harder and harder. He still managed to exercise some, but

<!-- chunk -->

### it was nothing like before. Mark’s risk markers for cardiovascular disease

<!-- chunk -->

### worsened, including an increase in his blood pressure and lipids. He was

<!-- chunk -->

### now well on his way to a heart attack or stroke. Oh . . . and he also

<!-- chunk -->

### developed anxiety and mild depression. But who wouldn’t be depressed and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxious in his situation? His doctor told him to try yoga and go on a diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, that advice wasn’t all that helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is the root cause of Mark’s metabolic disorders? Within six

<!-- chunk -->

### months of starting the corticosteroid, he developed diabetes and obesity.

<!-- chunk -->

### The evidence is overwhelmingly clear that the culprit was the medication,

<!-- chunk -->

### not Mark’s willpower or discipline. His cravings and lack of energy are

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of metabolic dysfunction. His depression and anxiety are also

<!-- chunk -->

### known side effects of this medication. In some ways, he’s lucky that he

<!-- chunk -->

### didn’t get manic or psychotic, which are also possible side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Reactions like Mark’s happen all the time with medications like

<!-- chunk -->

### prednisone. Other medications can cause these kinds of metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, too, including many psychiatric medications. But the takeaway

<!-- chunk -->

### here isn’t that one should never take these medications: autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders like Mark’s can cause permanent organ damage, and the side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of treatment are often determined to be a price worth paying when

<!-- chunk -->

### weighed against the severity of a disease. The point is that metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### problems are not simple, nor are they avoidable through sheer willpower.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medication is only one of many, many possible causes. For example, a

<!-- chunk -->

### person who has experienced

<!-- chunk -->

### horrible childhood abuse is likely to have altered levels of cortisol, the

<!-- chunk -->

### body’s equivalent hormone to prednisone. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people

<!-- chunk -->

### with a trauma history are more likely to develop metabolic disorders . . .

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental disorders, too. And once people develop a metabolic problem,

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms and lifestyle changes like Mark’s aren’t unusual at all.

# What Is Metabolism?

<!-- chunk -->

### When most people hear the word “metabolism,” they picture our bodies

<!-- chunk -->

### burning fat and calories. The common wisdom is that people with a “high

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism” are skinny and have trouble gaining weight, while people with

<!-- chunk -->

### a “low metabolism” are overweight and gain weight easily—even if they

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t eat that much. That’s where metabolism begins and ends for most

<!-- chunk -->

### people.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolism is about so much more than burning calories, though that’s

<!-- chunk -->

### part of it. It influences every aspect of the way our bodies function.

<!-- chunk -->

### To make energy, our bodies need food, water, vitamins and minerals,

<!-- chunk -->

### and oxygen—we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste

<!-- chunk -->

### product of metabolism. When we eat food, it gets broken down into

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids, along with the vitamins and minerals

<!-- chunk -->

### that are hopefully also there. All of this is absorbed into our bloodstream

<!-- chunk -->

### and shuttled around the body. Once nutrients arrive at cells and enter them,

<!-- chunk -->

### they are used as building blocks for things like proteins or membranes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some might be stored as fat for a rainy day. But most of these nutrients will

<!-- chunk -->

### be converted into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### energy molecule of the cell. ATP makes the machinery of the cell work.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s the basic, high school biology version of metabolism. A one-

<!-- chunk -->

### sentence definition might be the following: Metabolism is the process of

<!-- chunk -->

### turning food into energy or building blocks for growing and maintaining

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, as well as the appropriate and efficient management of waste

<!-- chunk -->

### products. Metabolism is how our cells work. Our metabolism determines

<!-- chunk -->

### our cellular health, how our bodies and brains develop and function, and

<!-- chunk -->

### how we allocate resources

<!-- chunk -->

### to different cells at different times to optimize our survival. Metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### allows some cells to grow and thrive and lets others shrivel up and die in a

<!-- chunk -->

### complex cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes healthy and advantageous

<!-- chunk -->

### cells over those that might be old, weak, or simply more expendable. As the

<!-- chunk -->

### body’s resource management system, metabolism is all about adaptation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Our environment is constantly changing, and so are our circumstances in

<!-- chunk -->

### the environment. As a result, our metabolism is constantly changing to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### up with the shifts around us. These adaptations in metabolism allow us to

<!-- chunk -->

### thrive in optimal environments or to simply survive in situations that are

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful to the body, like food scarcity. But the availability of food isn’t the

<!-- chunk -->

### only change metabolism responds to—numerous other factors play a role,

<!-- chunk -->

### like psychological stress, light exposure, temperature, how much sleep we

<!-- chunk -->

### get, hormone levels, and the amount of oxygen available to cells. At the end

<!-- chunk -->

### of the day, metabolism is the body’s battle to stay alive. Many biological

<!-- chunk -->

### authorities would say that metabolism defines life itself.

# Energy Imbalances

<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolism is how our body creates and uses energy. And we can think of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with metabolism as energy imbalances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with metabolism lead to problems in the way cells function.

<!-- chunk -->

### This goes for all cells in the human body. For instance, when heart cells are

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically compromised, they don’t work as well to pump blood. Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells need precise control. They need to be turned on at appropriate times

<!-- chunk -->

### and then turned off at appropriate times. When brain cells are metabolically

<!-- chunk -->

### compromised, these on/off processes can be disrupted. Precision is

<!-- chunk -->

### everything when it comes to brain function, and as we will see, this

<!-- chunk -->

### disruption can result in what we know as symptoms of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain is the most complicated organ in the human body. In fact, the

<!-- chunk -->

### adult human brain is estimated to have about one hundred billion neurons.

<!-- chunk -->

### On top of that, there are an additional ten to fifty glial cells per neuron. The

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons are “nerve cells,” and the glial cells are often thought of as support

<!-- chunk -->

### cells to the neurons. Combined, there are about one trillion to five trillion

<!-- chunk -->

### cells in the human brain. One group of researchers challenged this estimate,

<!-- chunk -->

### suggesting it’s closer to eighty-six billion neurons and eighty-four billion

<!-- chunk -->

### glial cells, or 170 billion cells total.


<!-- chunk -->

### Regardless, it’s a lot of cells!

<!-- chunk -->

### What coordinates the function of all these cells? Many people would

<!-- chunk -->

### say neurotransmitters, the cell’s messenger chemicals. We can think of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters as either “go” signals or “stop” signals, often categorized

<!-- chunk -->

### as excitatory (go) or inhibitory (stop). There are other variations, but these

<!-- chunk -->

### distinctions will suffice for now. They have been the primary focus of

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroscientists and biological psychiatrists for decades. But what controls

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters? How do cells know when to release them? Many would

<!-- chunk -->

### say their release is triggered by neurotransmitters from other cells. I’m sure

<!-- chunk -->

### you see the problems with this answer. It is partially correct. However, as I

<!-- chunk -->

### will discuss throughout the remainder of this book, there are numerous

<!-- chunk -->

### other factors that dictate the action of brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ve established that cells need energy to work. This energy is used

<!-- chunk -->

### for all sorts of different things throughout the body, including making

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles function, creating and regulating hormones, and making and

<!-- chunk -->

### releasing neurotransmitters. The parts of the body that need the most energy

<!-- chunk -->

### tend to be the parts of the body most affected by metabolic problems. As

<!-- chunk -->

### you might imagine, topping the list are the brain and the heart.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although the brain makes up about 2 percent of the body mass, it uses

<!-- chunk -->

### about 20 percent of the body’s total energy at rest. Brain cells are

<!-- chunk -->

### exquisitely sensitive to disruptions in energy supply, and when there’s a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problem somewhere in the body, the brain usually knows. Given

<!-- chunk -->

### that our brains are the control centers of our bodies, they ultimately control

<!-- chunk -->

### our perceptions of reality. When there is a metabolic problem somewhere in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body, we might perceive pain, experience shortness of breath, or feel

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigued or lightheaded. If there is a metabolic problem in the brain itself,

<!-- chunk -->

### the signs and symptoms can take just about any form. Sometimes they are

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious, such as confusion, hallucinations, or a complete loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### consciousness. Other times, they are more subtle, like fatigue, trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrating, or mild depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes metabolic problems are acute, meaning that they are abrupt and

<!-- chunk -->

### dramatic. These can take the form of a heart attack, a stroke, or even death.

<!-- chunk -->

### A heart attack, for example, is usually due to a blood clot in one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### arteries feeding the heart. Some of the heart cells stop getting enough blood

<!-- chunk -->

### and oxygen. This prevents them from producing enough energy. If blood

<!-- chunk -->

### flow isn’t restored quickly, the heart cells die. This is a metabolic crisis in

<!-- chunk -->

### the heart. A stroke is an acute metabolic crisis in the brain. The ultimate

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic crisis is death itself, where the cells in the entire body stop

<!-- chunk -->

### producing energy. Many paths can lead to this whole-body energy failure—

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, severe accidents, cancer. They all result

<!-- chunk -->

### in the cells of the body no longer producing enough energy, and it is the

<!-- chunk -->

### lack of energy production that results in death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Heart attacks, strokes, and death are all examples of absolute and acute

<!-- chunk -->

### energy problems that result in cell death. However, there are less dramatic

<!-- chunk -->

### situations in which the energy supply to cells is compromised: Instead of a

<!-- chunk -->

### complete shutdown of energy production, the cells simply aren’t getting

<!-- chunk -->

### enough energy. Instead of cell death, the cells don’t work quite right. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### of these metabolic problems can last for just a few minutes, while others

<!-- chunk -->

### might last for hours. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a good example.

<!-- chunk -->

### It most commonly occurs when people haven’t eaten in a while. In mild

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, it results in feeling hungry, irritable, fatigued, or having trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrating. In moderate cases, it might result in a headache or feeling

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed. In severe cases, it can result in hallucinations, seizures, or coma.

<!-- chunk -->

### If it progresses further, it can result in absolute metabolic failure—death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before things get so severe, however, most people implement the obvious

<!-- chunk -->

### solution—they eat something. This raises blood sugar, and things begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### function normally again. Even if they don’t eat anything, the body has

<!-- chunk -->

### systems in place that usually prevent severe hypoglycemia. However, for

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetics who inject insulin or take medication to more forcibly lower blood

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar, these severe consequences are a real possibility. You might notice

<!-- chunk -->

### that brain symptoms dominate the above list of effects, even though the

<!-- chunk -->

### hypoglycemia is occurring throughout the entire body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other metabolic problems are not acute but instead chronic disorders with

<!-- chunk -->

### long-lasting symptoms—like diabetes, for example. Many people think of

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes as high blood sugar. However, a paradoxical and interesting way to

<!-- chunk -->

### think about diabetes is as an energy shortage, or a deficit in energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production. Glucose is the primary fuel source for cells. In diabetes, cells

<!-- chunk -->

### have trouble converting glucose into energy. The levels of glucose in the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood can be high, sometimes very high, yet that glucose has trouble getting

<!-- chunk -->

### into cells where it can be used. Getting glucose from the bloodstream into

<!-- chunk -->

### cells requires insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Diabetics have

<!-- chunk -->

### either a shortage of insulin or insulin resistance—a condition in which the

<!-- chunk -->

### body is not as responsive to insulin. When cells don’t have enough glucose,

<!-- chunk -->

### they aren’t able to produce enough energy. When they don’t have enough

<!-- chunk -->

### energy, they don’t work right.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since glucose is the primary fuel source for most cells in the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes can affect many different parts of the body. But not everyone has

<!-- chunk -->

### the same problems. The symptoms of diabetes can be wide-ranging and can

<!-- chunk -->

### change over time. In the beginning, symptoms are usually mild. They can

<!-- chunk -->

### include things like urinating too much or losing weight unexpectedly. They

<!-- chunk -->

### can also include mental symptoms such as fatigue or trouble concentrating.

<!-- chunk -->

### As the illness progresses, different organs can be affected. Some people

<!-- chunk -->

### develop problems with their eyes, nerves, or brains. Some people have heart

<!-- chunk -->

### attacks or strokes. Others experience kidney failure or contract serious

<!-- chunk -->

### infections that are difficult to treat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why are the effects on people so different? Why don’t all diabetics end

<!-- chunk -->

### up with the same symptoms and the same body parts failing? The answer is

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated—and often related to metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolism is affected by numerous factors. It is always changing. And

<!-- chunk -->

### it is different in different cells of the body at different times. Some cells can

<!-- chunk -->

### be functioning normally while others are dying. Some cells may gradually

<!-- chunk -->

### malfunction as the result of chronic energy deprivation. Metabolism is not

<!-- chunk -->

### all-or-nothing. It is controlled at a variety of levels. Some of the factors that

<!-- chunk -->

### affect metabolism do so broadly, while others are specific to distinct parts

<!-- chunk -->

### of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. Some are specific to specific organs. Some are specific to specific

<!-- chunk -->

### cells.

# Metabolism Is Like the Flow of Traffic

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of it like this—the body is like a large city with lots of roads and

<!-- chunk -->

### highways. There is a lot of traffic. Each car is like a human cell. During

<!-- chunk -->

### rush hour, it can be hectic. If you’re in a car, it can feel chaotic. So many

<!-- chunk -->

### things to pay attention to: stoplights, cars changing lanes, someone on their

<!-- chunk -->

### cell phone swerving into your lane. If you look at the traffic from above,

<!-- chunk -->

### however—say, from the top of a skyscraper—it looks pretty orderly. The

<!-- chunk -->

### roads are organized. The cars and trucks are moving along. Some cars stop

<!-- chunk -->

### while other cars go. They wait their turn and then start going again. Cars go

<!-- chunk -->

### slow on certain roads but then speed up on highways. Some cars change

<!-- chunk -->

### lanes, and the cars around them have to slow down to let them in. Others

<!-- chunk -->

### might be having problems and be stuck on the side of the road. There might

<!-- chunk -->

### be some traffic accidents, causing other cars to take a detour. If you were to

<!-- chunk -->

### try to take in the specifics of each and every car at the same time, it would

<!-- chunk -->

### be overwhelming—there are too many cars, too many stoplights, too many

<!-- chunk -->

### other factors to keep in mind. But when you look at the big picture, traffic is

<!-- chunk -->

### moving along. The city is working. People are getting to where they need to

<!-- chunk -->

### go. The city is alive. It has energy; you can see it flow. This is the way to

<!-- chunk -->

### think about metabolism in the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Back to the question I posed earlier—why do some people with diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### have different symptoms? More important to the theory of brain energy, if

<!-- chunk -->

### all mental disorders are metabolic disorders, why doesn’t everyone with a

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorder have the same symptoms?

<!-- chunk -->

### Illnesses and symptoms are like traffic jams. Either traffic isn’t flowing

<!-- chunk -->

### optimally, or it stops altogether. One highway might represent the pancreas.

<!-- chunk -->

### An access road might represent a specific brain region that controls

<!-- chunk -->

### attention and focus.

<!-- chunk -->

### What causes a traffic jam on a given road or highway? Myriad things. Car

<!-- chunk -->

### accidents, road construction, potholes, or traffic signals failing to work. The

<!-- chunk -->

### design and maintenance of the roads play a role, and the cars and drivers

<!-- chunk -->

### do, too. Some parts of the city have more frequent traffic problems. This

<!-- chunk -->

### can be due to poor design, poor maintenance, or more aggressive or careless

<!-- chunk -->

### drivers on those roads. The areas of the city with regular traffic problems

<!-- chunk -->

### represent “symptoms” or “illnesses”—places where the traffic isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### “working” properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### When it comes to human illnesses and symptoms, we are talking about

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the body or brain that aren’t working properly. This is usually the

<!-- chunk -->

### result of an issue in one of three areas: the development, function, or

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance of human cells. Cells must develop properly in order to meet

<!-- chunk -->

### the needs of the body. Function is making sure all the parts are doing what

<!-- chunk -->

### they are supposed to be doing, in the right ways at the right times.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maintenance is keeping everything in good shape. This is analogous to

<!-- chunk -->

### traffic needing adequate design and construction of roads and bridges

<!-- chunk -->

### (development); all the cars, drivers, and traffic lights working properly

<!-- chunk -->

### (function); and the whole system being regularly serviced—cars tuned up,

<!-- chunk -->

### roads patched, stoplights tested, etc. (maintenance).

<!-- chunk -->

### In humans, these three things—development, function, and maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### of cells—ultimately depend upon one thing: metabolism. If there are

<!-- chunk -->

### problems with metabolism, there will be problems in one or more of these

<!-- chunk -->

### areas. If the problems are significant enough, there will be “symptoms.”

<!-- chunk -->

### So, what affects metabolism? Just like traffic in the city, many things!

<!-- chunk -->

### Diet, light, sleep, exercise, drugs and alcohol, genes, hormones, stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, and inflammation, to name a few. However, each of these

<!-- chunk -->

### things affects different cells in different ways. Depending upon the mix of

<!-- chunk -->

### factors that someone is exposed to, different cells and organs will be

<!-- chunk -->

### affected, resulting in different symptoms and different illnesses. Just like

<!-- chunk -->

### some roads are more susceptible to traffic jams, some cells are more

<!-- chunk -->

### susceptible to metabolic failure. Sometimes, parts of the body will function

<!-- chunk -->

### normally at times of low demand but begin to malfunction at times of

<!-- chunk -->

### increased demand—just like a rush-hour meltdown on a city highway that’s

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelmed by commuters.

<!-- chunk -->

### We’ve established that metabolism defines life itself; that it determines how

<!-- chunk -->

### cells function, that it affects and is affected by innumerable factors. In a

<!-- chunk -->

### way, of course mental disorders are related to metabolism. In essence,

<!-- chunk -->

### everything is! So what?

<!-- chunk -->

### What I’ll show in the coming chapters is that metabolism is, in fact, the

<!-- chunk -->

### only way to connect the dots of mental illness. It is the lowest common

<!-- chunk -->

### denominator for all mental disorders, all of the risk factors for mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, and even all of the treatments that are currently used. And,

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps most significantly, although metabolism is complex, solving

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problems is usually possible, oftentimes through straightforward

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Before I dive into the evidence for all of this, however, I first need to

<!-- chunk -->

### clarify what a mental disorder is in the first place. This question has long

<!-- chunk -->

### plagued the mental health field, and it centers on one issue in particular—

<!-- chunk -->

### the difference between normal mental states (especially stressful and

<!-- chunk -->

### adverse ones) and a mental disorder.

# A


# Mental States and Mental Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### s I discussed in Part One, one of the dilemmas in the mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### field is distinguishing between normal human emotions and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, especially since the symptoms can be the same. We all get

<!-- chunk -->

### anxious or mildly depressed from time to time. If we experience a

<!-- chunk -->

### devastating loss, such as the unexpected death of a spouse, we may get

<!-- chunk -->

### severely depressed for a period. These are all normal reactions. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### hardwired into our brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, when people are exposed to numerous stressors all at once, or

<!-- chunk -->

### when the stressors are extreme or overwhelming (such as being violently

<!-- chunk -->

### assaulted), these normal and understandable initial reactions can quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to what we call “mental illness.” The diagnoses are all over the map.

<!-- chunk -->

### Trauma or extreme stress can lead to anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD,

<!-- chunk -->

### eating disorders, substance use disorders, personality disorders, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis. How do stress and trauma lead to all these different disorders?

<!-- chunk -->

### And where is the line between a normal reaction to adversity and a

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder?

<!-- chunk -->

### Two issues have made these questions particularly difficult to answer: (1)

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms are the same, and (2) both mental states and mental disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to poor health outcomes. Nonetheless, distinguishing between

<!-- chunk -->

### normal mental states and mental disorders is critically important. Mental

<!-- chunk -->

### states are adaptive reactions to adversity. Mental disorders represent the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain malfunctioning. These distinctions have direct implications for

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment. Helping people cope with adversity is very different than treating

<!-- chunk -->

### a brain that is malfunctioning.

# Understanding “Normal”: Stress and the Stress

# Response

<!-- chunk -->

### Stressors are the psychological and social factors in the biopsychosocial

<!-- chunk -->

### model—the ones that people usually think of as the “mental” causes of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many clinicians and researchers still see biological factors as separate

<!-- chunk -->

### from psychological and social ones. For example, they might believe that

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations are due to a biological chemical imbalance, but that someone

<!-- chunk -->

### with schizophrenia can also suffer from low self-esteem, which is a

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological problem. They may try to address both, but they often see

<!-- chunk -->

### these issues as unrelated and separate. One requires medication, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### other requires talk therapy. I disagree with this dichotomous view. I think

<!-- chunk -->

### biological, psychological, and social factors are all interconnected and

<!-- chunk -->

### inseparable. Biology influences our psychology and how we get along with

<!-- chunk -->

### others. But our psychology and our interactions with other people influence

<!-- chunk -->

### our biology. These connections can impact all mental and metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. To begin unpacking this, let me start by making some

<!-- chunk -->

### overarching observations about our species.

<!-- chunk -->

### Humans are meant to live in groups. We seek out and attach to other

<!-- chunk -->

### people—parents, lovers, children, friends, teachers, and community

<!-- chunk -->

### members. These connections form a network of safety and support in our

<!-- chunk -->

### lives. We are biologically driven to want, and even need, these people.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a

<!-- chunk -->

### conundrum, though: While we must live with other people, other people are

<!-- chunk -->

### actually the primary sources of psychological and social stress. Most of

<!-- chunk -->

### these stressors revolve around relationships, roles, resources, and

<!-- chunk -->

### responsibilities. People can be stressed over expectations on them, financial

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, performance problems, relationship problems, or status in

<!-- chunk -->

### society. Some people experience chronic stressors due to socioeconomic

<!-- chunk -->

### status, abuse, neglect, race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, physical abilities,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive abilities, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and so many

<!-- chunk -->

### other factors. People can be harmed or threatened by other people. We

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes make each other feel unsafe. We sometimes make other humans

<!-- chunk -->

### feel like they aren’t good enough. There are countless reasons that humans

<!-- chunk -->

### stress other humans. And interestingly, the absence of other humans, or

<!-- chunk -->

### loneliness, is also a powerful stressor unto itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these stressors lead to the stress response, a complex array of

<!-- chunk -->

### biological changes in the brain and body. The stress response includes

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in four domains:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which results in

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol flowing through the bloodstream;

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.The sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, which results in

<!-- chunk -->

### adrenaline (epinephrine and norepinephrine) flowing through the

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream;

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.Inflammation;

<!-- chunk -->

### 4.Changes in gene expression, especially in the hippocampus.


<!-- chunk -->

### All of these changes, in turn, affect metabolism. They comprise a

<!-- chunk -->

### person’s response to adversity. They are not disorders. They set the stage

<!-- chunk -->

### for “fight or flight.” However, in most day-to-day stressful situations, we

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t fight or flee. Instead, we just stay put—but we get angry, or anxious,

<!-- chunk -->

### or irritable, or overwhelmed, or confused, or terrified, or hurt, or sad. Yet

<!-- chunk -->

### these core changes are still occurring in our bodies and brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### Different stressful situations result in different behaviors and emotions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some stressors make you want to yell at someone, such as the driver who

<!-- chunk -->

### cuts you off in traffic and then flips you off for no reason. Other stressors

<!-- chunk -->

### might make you ruminate and not sleep well, such as feeling unprepared for

<!-- chunk -->

### an important exam the next day. Others might make you want to curl up

<!-- chunk -->

### into a ball and cry, such as getting dumped by the love of your life. All of

<!-- chunk -->

### these situations involve the stress response. While similar mechanisms are

<!-- chunk -->

### involved, clear differences trigger different brain regions to create different

<!-- chunk -->

### responses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although these are normal, the stress response takes a toll—a metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### toll. The body uses energy to produce these changes, meaning less energy is

<!-- chunk -->

### available for other functions. Many of these responses create a state of high

<!-- chunk -->

### alert. In some situations, the person feels threatened and prepares to fight or

<!-- chunk -->

### argue with someone. In other situations, the person may feel wounded,

<!-- chunk -->

### vulnerable, or powerless and try to hide from the world. In either case,

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic resources are being mobilized. The heart is pumping faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blood pressure is increasing. Blood glucose is rising. Hormones are

<!-- chunk -->

### flowing. Inflammatory cytokines are being released. The body is mounting

<!-- chunk -->

### resources and energy for its own defense.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the stress is mild, people who are resilient and metabolically

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy deal with it. It can be over in a matter of seconds or minutes.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if a body is metabolically compromised, or if the stress is

<!-- chunk -->

### extreme, people can be pushed over the edge, and a new mental or

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorder can quickly emerge. For those with preexisting

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, symptoms can become even worse. That’s right: Stress can

<!-- chunk -->

### exacerbate every known mental and metabolic disorder. People with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression may get more depressed. People with alcoholism may fall off the

<!-- chunk -->

### wagon. People with schizophrenia may hallucinate. People with

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease may get agitated and combative. People with epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### may experience a seizure. People with diabetes may have their blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### skyrocket. And people with cardiovascular disease may have chest pain or a

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attack. Some people die—from stress alone. This is all well

<!-- chunk -->

### established.

<!-- chunk -->

### A separate medical field has tried to make sense of all of this—the field

<!-- chunk -->

### of psychosomatic medicine or mind-body medicine. Many healthcare

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals have observed the relationship between psychological and

<!-- chunk -->

### social factors affecting the health of the body. Practitioners in this field

<!-- chunk -->

### understand that all these risk factors play a role in human physiology. These

<!-- chunk -->

### factors are often referred to as the social determinants of health. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### social factors, such as poverty, abuse, or living in a high-crime

<!-- chunk -->

### neighborhood, can have huge consequences on health and longevity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the most compelling data on this comes from the adverse

<!-- chunk -->

### childhood experiences (ACEs) studies that started between 1995 and

<!-- chunk -->

### and looked at the number of adverse experiences that children and

<!-- chunk -->

### adolescents encounter and their effects on long-term health outcomes, both

<!-- chunk -->

### physical and mental. These ongoing studies have looked at stressors early in

<!-- chunk -->

### life, such as physical and sexual abuse, neglect, household substance abuse,

<!-- chunk -->

### household mental illness, exposure to domestic violence, and parental

<!-- chunk -->

### divorce, and then determined if these early experiences were associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with later health outcomes. A 2017 meta-analysis of thirty-seven such

<!-- chunk -->

### studies looking at twenty-three health outcomes in more than 250,000

<!-- chunk -->

### people found that they are.


<!-- chunk -->

### The more ACEs a child has, the more likely he

<!-- chunk -->

### or she will have poor health outcomes. ACEs increase the probability for

<!-- chunk -->

### physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes by 25 to 52 percent. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with two to three times higher rates of smoking, poor self-rated

<!-- chunk -->

### health, cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease. ACEs lead to a three-

<!-- chunk -->

### to sixfold increase in the rates of sexual risk-taking, poor mental health,

<!-- chunk -->

### problematic alcohol use, and illicit drug use. They also lead to more than a

<!-- chunk -->

### sevenfold increase in being the victim or perpetrator of violence, a tenfold

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in problematic drug use, and a thirtyfold increase in suicide

<!-- chunk -->

### attempts. ACEs clearly affect mortality. One study of 17,000 people that

<!-- chunk -->

### looked specifically at mortality data estimated that having six or more

<!-- chunk -->

### ACEs takes twenty years off a person’s life compared to those with no

<!-- chunk -->

### ACEs.


<!-- chunk -->

### These studies have led many people to conclude that ACEs cause both

<!-- chunk -->

### physical and mental illnesses. Some experts have gone so far as to suggest

<!-- chunk -->

### that ACEs, in particular childhood trauma and abuse, are likely the common

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway to all mental disorders. But let me remind you, these are

<!-- chunk -->

### correlations. They don’t prove causation. More importantly, not everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### who has

<!-- chunk -->

### a horrible childhood develops a mental disorder, and many people who end

<!-- chunk -->

### up with mental disorders have perfectly fine childhoods. Nonetheless, if

<!-- chunk -->

### these adverse experiences are playing some role in these different disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### how does that work? What is happening in the body and brain to cause all

<!-- chunk -->

### of this?

# Limited Resources

<!-- chunk -->

### For decades, researchers have been studying the biological effects of stress

<!-- chunk -->

### on the brain and body to better understand these relationships, hoping to

<!-- chunk -->

### identify the cause-and-effect pathways from stressful life events to poor

<!-- chunk -->

### health outcomes.

<!-- chunk -->

### We know that when the body is stressed, metabolic resources are being

<!-- chunk -->

### diverted to the fight-or-flight system. This leaves less energy available for

<!-- chunk -->

### other functions. Any cells that were already struggling can begin to fail.

<!-- chunk -->

### This can lead to metabolic and mental symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress also impairs the body’s ability to maintain itself. Cells engage in

<!-- chunk -->

### housekeeping functions daily. They get rid of damaged cell parts, various

<!-- chunk -->

### waste molecules, and misfolded proteins, and they make new ones to take

<!-- chunk -->

### their places in a process often called autophagy. Auto means “self” and

<!-- chunk -->

### phagy means “eat,” so this term literally means “to eat yourself.” Our cells

<!-- chunk -->

### degrade these old parts in waste-disposal systems called lysosomes. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### of this material is recycled and used to make new parts. High levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisol have been found to inhibit autophagy, slowing down or stopping

<!-- chunk -->

### this maintenance process.


<!-- chunk -->

### Problems with autophagy have been found in a

<!-- chunk -->

### wide variety of disorders including neurodegenerative,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodevelopmental, autoimmune, inflammatory, cancer, schizophrenia,

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder, autism, alcoholism, and major depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### Disturbances

<!-- chunk -->

### in autophagy are known to affect neuroplasticity and the maintenance of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to problems with autophagy, when cells are stressed, they

<!-- chunk -->

### also slow the process of making new proteins. This appears to conserve

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic resources for the body’s defense system. One way they delay

<!-- chunk -->

### making

<!-- chunk -->

### these proteins is by sequestering messenger RNA molecules (the

<!-- chunk -->

### instructions for new proteins) into little bubbles called “stress granules.”


<!-- chunk -->

### These have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, and high

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of cortisol stimulate their production.


<!-- chunk -->

### One additional way that stress can lead to maintenance problems is

<!-- chunk -->

### through sleep disruption. It is well established that stress can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia. Sleep is critically important to both physical and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s a time when the body prioritizes maintenance functions. When people

<!-- chunk -->

### aren’t sleeping well, their bodies aren’t doing this maintenance work. On

<!-- chunk -->

### top of that, sleep deprivation, in and of itself, is stressful and can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### higher levels of cortisol, which can make the problem even worse.

<!-- chunk -->

### All this stress, regardless of when it occurs, results in premature aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve already mentioned that all mental disorders are associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### premature aging, but stress alone can also cause it. One study tried to

<!-- chunk -->

### quantify the effects of stress on aging.


<!-- chunk -->

### The study recruited fifty-eight

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy premenopausal women who were mothers to either healthy or

<!-- chunk -->

### chronically ill children. The women’s average age was thirty-eight, and they

<!-- chunk -->

### did not yet have identified health problems. The researchers assessed three

<!-- chunk -->

### metrics of aging and asked the mothers to rate their perceived levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. The mothers with the highest levels of stress over the longest periods

<!-- chunk -->

### of time showed signs of accelerated aging compared to the lowest-stress

<!-- chunk -->

### women. On average, they aged ten years faster.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress clearly plays a role in human health and takes a serious metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### toll. It uses energy that could otherwise be used for proper cell function and

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance. When people are stressed in extreme ways or for prolonged

<!-- chunk -->

### periods of time, their bodies can get worn down and begin to malfunction,

<!-- chunk -->

### resulting in various physical and mental disorders, or just plain old aging. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain or body are already compromised and vulnerable, stress can make

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms worse, because the energy needed for the stress response is

<!-- chunk -->

### diverting energy from these vulnerable cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress-reduction practices, such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga,

<!-- chunk -->

### can play a powerful role in treatment (more on that in Part Three).

<!-- chunk -->

### However, they aren’t the solution for everyone. If a person is living in an

<!-- chunk -->

### adverse

<!-- chunk -->

### environment, turning off the stress response may not be possible or even

<!-- chunk -->

### advisable. Soldiers fighting in a war are in danger. And while their service

<!-- chunk -->

### directly results in greater risks for mental and metabolic disorders, their

<!-- chunk -->

### heightened stress response is protecting them. The same applies to people in

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous neighborhoods. Instructing people in dangerous environments to

<!-- chunk -->

### take deep breaths and be mindful isn’t the full answer. When they get to

<!-- chunk -->

### safety, these strategies might play a role, but the damage may already be

<!-- chunk -->

### done by then.

<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, stress may not be the cause of one’s mental illness at all.

<!-- chunk -->

### In that case, stress-reduction techniques likely won’t be all that helpful.

# Understanding “Disorders”: A New Definition of

# Mental Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### As I discussed in earlier chapters, the current classification of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders is fraught with problems—heterogeneity, comorbidity, and a lack

<!-- chunk -->

### of validity. None of the diagnoses are true and distinct disorders unto

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### The NIH has recognized this for some time and developed a new

<!-- chunk -->

### framework for thinking about mental illnesses—the Research Domain

<!-- chunk -->

### Criteria (RDoC). The RDoC starts fresh, ignoring our current diagnostic

<!-- chunk -->

### labels and classifications. Instead, the framework focuses on domains of

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning—emotion, cognition, motivation, and social behavior. It

<!-- chunk -->

### assumes ranges in these constructs from normal to abnormal, and it

<!-- chunk -->

### encourages researchers to explore these constructs from a perspective other

<!-- chunk -->

### than a diagnostic label. At one point, proponents of the RDoC were calling

<!-- chunk -->

### for a complete overhaul of our current psychiatric diagnostic criteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Changing psychiatry and the mental health field, however, is no easy feat,

<!-- chunk -->

### so our current diagnostic criteria remain, despite all the known flaws. RDoC

<!-- chunk -->

### remains only in the realm of research at this point. However, for our

<!-- chunk -->

### purposes, I am going to use this model to define mental illness in the

<!-- chunk -->

### context of the brain energy theory.

<!-- chunk -->

### It starts by setting aside DSM-5 diagnostic labels and focusing instead on

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. This doesn’t mean that some of the diagnoses aren’t useful.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many are. Our current diagnostic labels simply describe some of the more

<!-- chunk -->

### common ways that the brain malfunctions. After all, the brain works, or

<!-- chunk -->

### fails to work, in predictable ways, and we can use those common narratives

<!-- chunk -->

### to our benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### The human brain is like a machine—a very sophisticated and

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated machine, but a machine nonetheless. It has many parts all

<!-- chunk -->

### designed to do certain things. Some are fairly straightforward, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### making our muscles move or sensing what we feel or see. Other functions

<!-- chunk -->

### of the brain are more complicated, like sophisticated computer algorithms

<!-- chunk -->

### that are triggered in certain situations. In one way or another, all these brain

<!-- chunk -->

### functions can be tied to helping us survive, adapt to our environments, or

<!-- chunk -->

### reproduce.

<!-- chunk -->

### Given that the human brain has billions, if not trillions, of cells, and that

<!-- chunk -->

### each cell is a complicated machine itself, we face a potentially

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelming problem: with so many cells, it seems there’s an almost

<!-- chunk -->

### infinite number of ways that all of these “parts” could malfunction. For

<!-- chunk -->

### better or worse, this is where the mental health field has been focused, with

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers trying to understand how the machine works, step-by-step. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### an overwhelming task, the notion of wholly mapping something as

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated as the human brain, and waiting for this work to be finished

<!-- chunk -->

### has arguably limited our progress in better understanding and treating

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it doesn’t have to be so complicated. It turns out that all symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### of mental illness actually correspond to normal mental states or brain

<!-- chunk -->

### functions, but gone awry: present when they should not be, absent when

<!-- chunk -->

### they should be present, or more or less active or persistent than is

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate. These brain functions include things that relate to emotions,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, behavior, and motivation. As I will discuss, even some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### more bizarre-seeming symptoms of mental illness, such as delusions and

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations, can be tied to normal brain functions. Although we don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### know precisely how all of these functions work, we know they exist. That’s

<!-- chunk -->

### enough for our purposes here.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start with a simple definition, then: Mental illness is when the brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### not working properly. Normal brain functions are either overactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive, or absent. An easy example is having a panic attack for no

<!-- chunk -->

### clear reason. The panic system is beneficial when facing danger. It gets us

<!-- chunk -->

### moving. When it gets triggered for no clear reason, it’s dysfunctional and

<!-- chunk -->

### maladaptive. Sometimes the opposite can occur—brain functions that fail to

<!-- chunk -->

### activate in the right situations. Consider memory impairment in someone

<!-- chunk -->

### with dementia or a lack of social skills in someone with autism.

<!-- chunk -->

### When it comes to symptoms of mental illness, many people would say

<!-- chunk -->

### that they can’t possibly correspond to normal brain functions. It can seem

<!-- chunk -->

### like somehow the brain is doing unique and highly unusual things for no

<!-- chunk -->

### clear reason. I look at it differently. Like the parts of any machine, the parts

<!-- chunk -->

### of the brain are either working or they aren’t. If they perform their usual

<!-- chunk -->

### function, but get turned on at the wrong time, it can result in symptoms that

<!-- chunk -->

### seem bizarre. The same is true when normal brain functions fail to activate,

<!-- chunk -->

### or if two unrelated brain functions are mistakenly occurring at the same

<!-- chunk -->

### time.

# A Simple Example: Three Cars

<!-- chunk -->

### Let me use an analogy to explain how I think about the way people with

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness differ from those who are having “normal” stress reactions,

<!-- chunk -->

### even though their symptoms can be the same and they can both lead to poor

<!-- chunk -->

### health outcomes. I’ll describe three cars. Each is the same make and model,

<!-- chunk -->

### so in theory, they should have the same lifespan and overall “health.” Each

<!-- chunk -->

### represents a human being.

<!-- chunk -->

### Car A lives in California, where the skies are blue, and the roads are in

<!-- chunk -->

### great condition. The owner doesn’t drive much—maybe twice a week. Car

<!-- chunk -->

### A is housed in a garage and gets regular maintenance. Car A is living the

<!-- chunk -->

### good life!

<!-- chunk -->

### Car B lives in the mountains of New Hampshire, where the winters can

<!-- chunk -->

### be fierce, and the back roads are filled with potholes. The owner drives the

<!-- chunk -->

### car every day and doesn’t have a garage to store it in. When winter comes,

<!-- chunk -->

### Car B gets snow tires, and sometimes even snow chains. In a blizzard, Car

<!-- chunk -->

### B is using its headlights, windshield wipers, blinkers, snow tires and chains,

<!-- chunk -->

### and its four-wheel drive system. The brakes are applied often so that the

<!-- chunk -->

### driver doesn’t lose control. In these situations, Car B is getting very low gas

<!-- chunk -->

### mileage compared to Car A. Car B also has more maintenance problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### given the harsh winter environment and difficult driving conditions. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### end, Car B has more “health problems” and ends up living a shorter life

<!-- chunk -->

### than Car A.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cars A and B are “normal”—they are both doing what they are

<!-- chunk -->

### supposed to, given the environmental circumstances they’re in. Neither has

<!-- chunk -->

### a disorder. Car B has more health problems and ends up living a shorter life,

<!-- chunk -->

### but given the adversity it faces, this is normal. The adaptations it uses, such

<!-- chunk -->

### as snow tires and chains, four-wheel drive, and frequent braking, are like

<!-- chunk -->

### stress responses—depression, anxiety, fear, anger. They help Car B navigate

<!-- chunk -->

### its difficult environment and they serve extraordinarily useful purposes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without them, Car B would be much worse off.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now let me tell you about the third car. Car C lives in Indiana, where

<!-- chunk -->

### the weather is less harsh than New Hampshire, and the roads are in decent

<!-- chunk -->

### shape. It gets driven five days a week, sometimes in good weather and

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes in bad. But Car C has problems. It turns on its windshield wipers

<!-- chunk -->

### and blinkers even in sunny weather. The wiper blades are worn thin because

<!-- chunk -->

### they get used so much. They end up scratching the windshield. Car C

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes uses its four-wheel drive and travels only twenty-five miles per

<!-- chunk -->

### hour on the highway, even though it’s sunny and all the other cars are going

<!-- chunk -->

### sixty. When Car C drives at night, it doesn’t turn on its lights, even though

<!-- chunk -->

### they are needed. Car C has a disorder comparable to a mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although it has the exact same features and adaptive strategies as Cars A

<!-- chunk -->

### and B, it is using some of them at the wrong times and under the wrong

<!-- chunk -->

### circumstances. Meanwhile, it’s failing to use others that it should be using.

<!-- chunk -->

### Car C ends up needing quite a bit of maintenance. It also gets into traffic

<!-- chunk -->

### accidents. Car C’s disorder is seriously affecting its health and safety and

<!-- chunk -->

### impacting its ability to get along with other cars on the road. Car C ends up

<!-- chunk -->

### dying an early death.

<!-- chunk -->

### So . . . Cars A and B are “normal,” and Car C has a disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### People who are struggling with adversity, like Car B, often need help, even

<!-- chunk -->

### if their brains are not malfunctioning. Their biology is responding to their

<!-- chunk -->

### adverse life experiences in “normal,” predictable, and adaptive ways. To aid

<!-- chunk -->

### them, we need to change their environments or help them respond optimally

<!-- chunk -->

### to harsh conditions. For the most part, these are societal factors—things like

<!-- chunk -->

### war, poverty, food insecurity, abuse, systemic racism, homophobia,

<!-- chunk -->

### misogyny, sexual harassment, anti-Semitism, and many other societal

<!-- chunk -->

### “blizzards.” Changing society so that these blizzards no longer exist is the

<!-- chunk -->

### ideal way to deal with these issues. In the meantime, helping people cope as

<!-- chunk -->

### best as possible can also be helpful.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brains of people with mental disorders are malfunctioning. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### doing things at the wrong times or with the wrong intensity, or they are

<!-- chunk -->

### failing to do things that they should be doing—as in the case of Car C. You

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t need to know precisely how these work in order to determine if there

<!-- chunk -->

### is a problem or not, just like you don’t need to fully understand the inner

<!-- chunk -->

### workings of a car and its windshield wiper system to know if there is a

<!-- chunk -->

### problem or not. I imagine you’re thinking that the problem with Car C isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### with the car itself, but with the driver of Car C. In fact, you’re correct. I’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### get to that soon enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s important to point out that prolonged or extreme stress can lead to a

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder as well. At some point, Car B could easily develop maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### problems that result in adaptive strategies no longer working—maybe the

<!-- chunk -->

### lights stop working or the windshield wipers get worn thin and are no

<!-- chunk -->

### longer effective (underactive functions). Or the blinkers won’t turn off

<!-- chunk -->

### (overactive function). At that point, Car B would also have a disorder.

# A Human Example: Pain

<!-- chunk -->

### Now I’ll try to show you that this really does happen in the human body by

<!-- chunk -->

### focusing on an easy, straightforward example—pain. Since pain is

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled by nerve cells and brain regions, it serves as a perfect example

<!-- chunk -->

### for most of the mental symptoms I’ll discuss.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pain is a normal, healthy experience for humans—even though it is quite

<!-- chunk -->

### unpleasant. It saves our lives. It protects us from injuring ourselves. Pain is

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled by pain receptors, a nerve that goes to the spinal cord, another

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve that goes up to the brain, and then the regions of the brain that sense

<!-- chunk -->

### and process pain. The function and dysfunction of these neurons and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### regions gives us a simple framework that will help us better understand

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Broadly speaking, disorders of the pain system can be lumped into three

<!-- chunk -->

### categories based on the function of the cells in the pain system—overactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive, and absent.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Overactivity of the pain system is when people experience pain

<!-- chunk -->

### more frequently or intensely than they should. Clinicians and

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers will often describe this as hyperexcitability of the pain

<!-- chunk -->

### system. For example, people with diabetes can develop neuropathy,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the nerve cells or brain regions that process pain can fire when

<!-- chunk -->

### they shouldn’t or fail to turn off when they should. This causes pain

<!-- chunk -->

### even when nothing painful is happening. It can result in a chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### and debilitating pain condition for some people.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Underactivity can occur when people feel fewer pain signals than

<!-- chunk -->

### they should, which can also happen in people with diabetes. In

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to hyperexcitability, diabetic neuropathy can also result in

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced sensation, especially in the feet. The nerves aren’t working

<!-- chunk -->

### properly, and this results in underactivity of the pain system. We

<!-- chunk -->

### know the nerves are still there and alive because sometimes people

<!-- chunk -->

### feel something.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.Absence of pain can occur with prolonged and severe diabetes, but

<!-- chunk -->

### also with other conditions like spinal cord injuries or strokes. People

<!-- chunk -->

### feel absolutely nothing because the cells are dead or severely injured

<!-- chunk -->

### and no longer working.

<!-- chunk -->

### These three scenarios—overactivity, underactivity, and absence of function

<!-- chunk -->

### —are all disorders. The pain system isn’t working correctly.

<!-- chunk -->

### In some cases, it can be difficult to draw a line between normal pain and

<!-- chunk -->

### a pain disorder. One example is a herniated disc in the lower back causing

<!-- chunk -->

### pain. When the disc first becomes herniated, it’s not a disorder. The pain

<!-- chunk -->

### system is doing what it is supposed to do. If the pain goes on for a

<!-- chunk -->

### prolonged period of time, however, even after surgery and multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### medications, at some point we label it a pain disorder. What makes it a

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder? The nerves can become injured from the pressure of the herniated

<!-- chunk -->

### disc. These injured nerves can become hyperexcitable. They can send pain

<!-- chunk -->

### signals too often or too intensely. The point at which the pain goes from a

<!-- chunk -->

### normal response to a disorder is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish

<!-- chunk -->

### based on current diagnostic tests. In some cases, it’s not clear whether it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### normal or a disorder. However, when the pain becomes chronic, severe, and

<!-- chunk -->

### unprovoked, we call it a disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Regardless of whether pain is a normal response to an injury or a pain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, treating the pain is appropriate all the time. For example, we all

<!-- chunk -->

### know that people will feel pain when they get surgery. It’s normal and

<!-- chunk -->

### expected. However, we still treat it to alleviate suffering.

<!-- chunk -->

### This distinction between normal and abnormal is important. Doctors

<!-- chunk -->

### who treat pain need to have good clinical skills. They need to understand

<!-- chunk -->

### the many reasons that someone might be experiencing pain. They need to

<!-- chunk -->

### evaluate their patients for these causes before assuming that they have a

<!-- chunk -->

### pain disorder. If a patient comes in with foot pain, it might be due to a

<!-- chunk -->

### sprain, a muscle spasm, a broken bone, or a piece of glass wedged in the

<!-- chunk -->

### skin. Each cause requires very different treatments. Treating the pain as

<!-- chunk -->

### though it is due to pain disorder might bring some relief, but it won’t solve

<!-- chunk -->

### the problem. In fact, the problem may get worse. However, if no obvious

<!-- chunk -->

### causes for foot pain are present, the doctor might then diagnose a pain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. This same type of detailed cause-and-effect assessment is

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary when evaluating people for mental disorders. Again, helping

<!-- chunk -->

### people cope with adversity is very different than treating a malfunctioning

<!-- chunk -->

### brain.

# Back to Defining Mental Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s our new, simplified definition of mental illness: A mental illness is

<!-- chunk -->

### when the brain is not working properly. Now let’s expand on that

<!-- chunk -->

### definition: A mental illness is when the brain is not working properly over a

<!-- chunk -->

### period of time, and this causes mental symptoms, which lead to suffering or

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment in functioning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although this is a fairly short and concise definition, every part matters,

<!-- chunk -->

### and no part can be taken out of context. This definition includes four

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary components:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.The brain is not working properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.This results in mental symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.This malfunction occurs over a period of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### 4.The symptoms cause suffering or impairment in functioning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although these might seem like simple concepts, they can quickly get

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first component of this definition—the brain is not working

<!-- chunk -->

### properly—sounds straightforward. But it’s actually difficult to measure and

<!-- chunk -->

### assess based on current technologies, just like pain. We have many tests that

<!-- chunk -->

### can measure brain health and function, such as EEGs and neuroimaging

<!-- chunk -->

### studies. However, none of them is sensitive and specific enough to

<!-- chunk -->

### accurately diagnose a mental disorder. Measuring the function of

<!-- chunk -->

### microscopic brain regions is difficult. So, in the real world, how do we

<!-- chunk -->

### know if the brain isn’t working properly?

<!-- chunk -->

### That leads us to the second component of the definition—this results in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms. Symptoms are the best indicator of abnormal brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function. However, like pain, when it comes to symptoms of mental illness,

<!-- chunk -->

### most can be normal, healthy brain functions in the right circumstances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even something like hallucinations can occur in most people in the right

<!-- chunk -->

### circumstances. We all have hallucinations when we dream—we see things

<!-- chunk -->

### and hear

<!-- chunk -->

### things that aren’t there. When these things occur at the wrong time or when

<!-- chunk -->

### they fail to activate at the right time, they might represent a disorder. We

<!-- chunk -->

### can categorize the symptoms into the same three basic categories I used for

<!-- chunk -->

### pain—overactivity, underactivity, and absence of function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Component three—this malfunction occurs over a period of time—

<!-- chunk -->

### reinforces that the duration of symptoms matters. All of our brains fail to

<!-- chunk -->

### work perfectly at least some of the time, and this results in what we might

<!-- chunk -->

### call symptoms. Most of us have occasional lapses in our memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes, we think we hear a noise, but no one else hears it. Sometimes,

<!-- chunk -->

### we “wake up on the wrong side of the bed” and feel depressed for no clear

<!-- chunk -->

### reason. These are examples of the brain not working properly. These are not

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illnesses but common occurrences that can happen due to a variety

<!-- chunk -->

### of circumstances—a bad night’s sleep, an extraordinarily stressful situation,

<!-- chunk -->

### use of alcohol or drugs, or just having a bad day. These are usually short-

<!-- chunk -->

### lived experiences (also relating to metabolism) with an easy brain-body fix.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental illnesses need to be persistent problems with brain function that

<!-- chunk -->

### result in symptoms. The persistence of symptoms is currently part of our

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnostic process in the mental health field, but the amount of time varies

<!-- chunk -->

### by diagnosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### That brings us to component four of our definition: the symptoms cause

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering or impairment in functioning. We all have changes in emotions,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, motivation, and behaviors over the course of our lives. We learn.

<!-- chunk -->

### We grow. We meet new people and make changes. We go through

<!-- chunk -->

### challenging experiences. We suffer losses and setbacks. These fluctuations

<!-- chunk -->

### alone are not mental illness. Only when a person is distressed by these

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in an unusual way, or the changes prevent them from functioning in

<!-- chunk -->

### life, do we begin to consider the possibility of a mental illness. There is no

<!-- chunk -->

### question that this part of the definition is tricky, and the debates around the

<!-- chunk -->

### issue of suffering and impairment in functioning are complicated. Two

<!-- chunk -->

### issues are particularly important:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.People have the right to be unique, creative, make changes in

<!-- chunk -->

## their lives, and go against mainstream culture. Being different is

<!-- chunk -->

### not a mental illness. Yet other people’s rejection of uniqueness may

<!-- chunk -->

### cause suffering. For example, many teenagers go through a rebellious

<!-- chunk -->

### phase. This is often a normal part of growing up and separating from

<!-- chunk -->

### parents. This alone is usually not a mental illness. Many people go on

<!-- chunk -->

### diets and frequently check their weight. They begin to think more

<!-- chunk -->

### about what to eat and how they look. This is not automatically an

<!-- chunk -->

### eating disorder. Both situations involve changes in emotions,

<!-- chunk -->

### cognition, motivation, and behaviors, but unusual distress and the

<!-- chunk -->

### inability to function aren’t part of the picture.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Some people with mental disorders lack insight. They don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### realize that their symptoms are somehow abnormal. They don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### recognize how their symptoms affect their behavior and function.

<!-- chunk -->

### They have trouble understanding why other people perceive these

<!-- chunk -->

### changes as unusual. They may claim that they are perfectly normal.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if their symptoms are seriously impairing their ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### function in society, then a mental illness needs to be considered.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is common for people with hallucinations and delusions to lack

<!-- chunk -->

### insight into their illness. For instance, people with paranoia will say

<!-- chunk -->

### that they are really being persecuted—it’s not “mental,” it’s real.

<!-- chunk -->

### People with eating disorders will sometimes talk about how happy

<!-- chunk -->

### they are to be losing so much weight and looking better. They view

<!-- chunk -->

### any changes in functioning, such as devoting less time to school or

<!-- chunk -->

### friends, as the sacrifice needed to lose weight and look good. They

<!-- chunk -->

### may ignore the serious health problems that are evident to everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### else. Both will claim that their changes in emotions, cognition,

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation, and behaviors are normal and expected for anyone going

<!-- chunk -->

### through their circumstances. They will often deny any impairment in

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning. So, are these mental disorders? Yes. They are causing

<!-- chunk -->

### significant distress and/or impairment of functioning (this would

<!-- chunk -->

### include health problems), even if the person doesn’t see it or

<!-- chunk -->

### acknowledge it.

<!-- chunk -->

### These nuanced dilemmas sometimes make it difficult, if not impossible, to

<!-- chunk -->

### distinguish between being different and living in an unforgiving and rigid

<!-- chunk -->

### society versus having a mental illness. The mental health field has changed

<!-- chunk -->

### its stance around issues like this over the years, such as labeling

<!-- chunk -->

### homosexuality a disorder at one point in time and then reversing that

<!-- chunk -->

### decision.

# Symptoms of Mental Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### Now that we’ve arrived at and unpacked a new definition of mental illness,

<!-- chunk -->

### let me put it into action by outlining three broad scenarios that can produce

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of mental illness. They follow the model that I outlined for

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders of the pain system—brain functions that are overactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive, or absent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Overactive Brain Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### Overactivity or hyperexcitability of brain cells and networks has been

<!-- chunk -->

### documented in many mental disorders. When thinking about this

<!-- chunk -->

### phenomenon, we are looking for symptoms or brain functions that are

<!-- chunk -->

### occurring more often or more intensely than they should be, or at the wrong

<!-- chunk -->

### time.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fear and anxiety symptoms can result from hyperexcitability of the

<!-- chunk -->

### amygdala—one of the regions of the brain implicated in the fear response.

<!-- chunk -->

### These neurons may fire out of turn or not stop firing, which causes anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms at inappropriate times or an exaggerated fear response.

<!-- chunk -->

## Obsessions and compulsions can result from hyperexcitable cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### networks in the brain areas associated with grooming and checking

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors. We all normally groom ourselves and check things. OCD occurs

<!-- chunk -->

### when these systems are overactive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, are found in

<!-- chunk -->

### many mental and neurological disorders. They also occur in many people

<!-- chunk -->

### who never get diagnosed with any disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### The precise brain cells and regions that cause psychotic symptoms are

<!-- chunk -->

### currently unknown, despite decades of intensive research looking for them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nonetheless, there are a few ways that we can think about what might be

<!-- chunk -->

### happening in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The easiest way to understand psychotic symptoms is hyperexcitability

<!-- chunk -->

### of brain cells that process perceptions. For example, if the brain cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### networks that perceive sound are hyperexcitable, people will hear

<!-- chunk -->

### something that isn’t there—an auditory hallucination. Neurosurgeons can

<!-- chunk -->

### make people “hallucinate” by stimulating brain areas with an electrode.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hyperexcitable cells would be doing essentially the same thing.

<!-- chunk -->

### The problem might not be in the neurons that perceive sound but in

<!-- chunk -->

### other neurons that regulate them and slow them down. There are a group of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons called “cortical interneurons.” These neurons are known to be

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibitory, as they secrete gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, a

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter that slows activity in its target cells. Abnormalities in the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of these neurons have been found in many disorders, including

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and autism. This lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibition would result in overactivity of the neurons they are supposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### be inhibiting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another possibility is that psychotic symptoms are related to the sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### systems in the brain. As I mentioned, we all have hallucinations and

<!-- chunk -->

### delusions every day—in our sleep. When we dream, we hear things and see

<!-- chunk -->

### things that aren’t there. We can believe wild and crazy things. Many people

<!-- chunk -->

### have nightmares that include being chased or persecuted. If these

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences occur during sleep, they are just bad dreams, not mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. It’s possible that the same brain cells and networks that create

<!-- chunk -->

### these experiences at night are hyperexcitable and firing erroneously during

<!-- chunk -->

### the day in people with mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### For some delusions that can seem bizarre, such as Capgras syndrome in

<!-- chunk -->

### which people believe that their loved ones have been replaced by imposters,

<!-- chunk -->

### we actually do know some of the specific brain networks involved in this

<!-- chunk -->

### process.


<!-- chunk -->

### These areas of the brain appear to be overactive and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive.

<!-- chunk -->

### One important observation is that hallucinations are not as uncommon

<!-- chunk -->

### as most people would think. Researchers have found that 12 to 17 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of children ages nine to twelve and 5.8 percent of adults hallucinate during

<!-- chunk -->

### the day.


<!-- chunk -->

### Additionally, 37 percent of adults experience hallucinations when

<!-- chunk -->

### they are falling asleep, also known as “hypnagogic hallucinations.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Most

<!-- chunk -->

### of these people are not diagnosed with mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## Underactive Brain Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### Underactive brain cells and brain networks have been documented in many

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders. This concept easily explains at least some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms that we see. I distinguish underactive function from the absence

<!-- chunk -->

### of function because underactive function implies the cells are still alive and

<!-- chunk -->

### able to work at least some of the time. This is important, as it means that

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms will wax and wane. Sometimes things can seem normal, and

<!-- chunk -->

### other times the person can have symptoms. Here are some examples:

<!-- chunk -->

### •People with ADHD can have a reduction in the activity of

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus. These neurons help

<!-- chunk -->

### people focus, plan, and stay on task, so a reduction in their activity

<!-- chunk -->

### results in symptoms of ADHD.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Cognitive problems, such as memory impairment, can be due to

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced function of the neurons that are involved in the storage and

<!-- chunk -->

### retrieval of memories. These are clearly affected in Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease but also in most of the chronic psychiatric disorders. People

<!-- chunk -->

### with chronic mental disorders often have cognitive impairment, even

<!-- chunk -->

### if this isn’t part of their diagnostic criteria.

<!-- chunk -->

### •At least one aspect of depression can involve a reduction in the

<!-- chunk -->

### activity of a brain system called the default mode network.


<!-- chunk -->

### This

<!-- chunk -->

### results in a slowing or disorganization of normal brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### •“Emotional regulation” is a term used to describe symptoms in many

<!-- chunk -->

### different disorders, including mood, personality, and anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. There are brain systems that are designed to help us control

<!-- chunk -->

### our emotional responses and regulate our moods. In some people,

<!-- chunk -->

### these areas of the brain appear to be underactive, resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms such as unstable moods and anger outbursts.

<!-- chunk -->

## Absence of Specific Brain Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### Some mental disorders involve permanent changes in brain cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### connections. There are two primary causes of this—developmental

<!-- chunk -->

### problems and cell death. These problems are often associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, respectively. Cell

<!-- chunk -->

### death can also occur from things like a stroke or brain injury, which are

<!-- chunk -->

### different from neurodegenerative disorders, but these, too, can also result in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism is one example.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurons and/or connections between neurons appear to be missing or at

<!-- chunk -->

### least different.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with brain shrinkage and death of neurons. Once neurons die,

<!-- chunk -->

### there is usually no way to bring them back.

<!-- chunk -->

### In both cases, cells or connections that are supposed to be present are

<!-- chunk -->

### not, so the brain is unable to perform these functions. Symptoms due to

<!-- chunk -->

### these permanent changes are always present. They don’t wax and wane.

<!-- chunk -->

### The social deficits seen in autism are fixed. At least some of the cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### deficits seen in Alzheimer’s disease are also fixed. These don’t change from

<!-- chunk -->

### day to day. However, both autism and Alzheimer’s disease are also

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with ongoing mental symptoms that do wax and wane—anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis, and mood changes, to name a few.

<!-- chunk -->

### These three scenarios—overactive, underactive, and absent brain functions

<!-- chunk -->

### —can account for all symptoms of mental disorders. However, there are

<!-- chunk -->

### two additional situations that are worth mentioning, because at first glance,

<!-- chunk -->

### they may not appear to fit neatly into these categories: multifaceted brain

<!-- chunk -->

### adaptations and behavioral disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

## Multifaceted Brain Adaptations

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain sometimes has complicated responses to situations that involve

<!-- chunk -->

### multiple symptoms, with some of them representing activation of some

<!-- chunk -->

### brain functions and inactivation of others. I will discuss depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### hypomania,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the trauma response. All of these can be normal and adaptive when they

<!-- chunk -->

### occur at the right times under the right circumstances. They are similar to

<!-- chunk -->

### the activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems,

<!-- chunk -->

### which involve a complicated array of brain and body functions, some that

<!-- chunk -->

### get turned on and others that get turned off.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression is a normal reaction to many stressors, adversities, and

<!-- chunk -->

### losses. Almost everyone has been depressed at least once. It usually doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### last unrelentingly for two or more weeks, but it’s a normal brain response.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although it commonly includes changes in mood, energy, appetite, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, these changes can be very different in different people. Some people

<!-- chunk -->

### appear to have overactivity of the appetite system and others appear to have

<!-- chunk -->

### underactivity, resulting in eating too much or too little, respectively.

<!-- chunk -->

### Likewise, some people can sleep too much and others can’t sleep enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### Distilling depression into distinct symptoms, some that represent overactive

<!-- chunk -->

### or underactive brain regions, is likely to be the most effective and accurate

<!-- chunk -->

### way to understand depression, even though depression often involves many

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hypomania in many ways is the opposite of depression—people can

<!-- chunk -->

### feel great or euphoric, have increased energy, be more productive, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### get by on less sleep. This can also be normal. In fact, if it occurs in

<!-- chunk -->

### isolation, it’s not a diagnosable disorder according to DSM-5. Most people

<!-- chunk -->

### have experienced symptoms of hypomania at some point or another in life.

<!-- chunk -->

### This commonly occurs when people fall in love, but it can also occur when

<!-- chunk -->

### people are excited about a project or an accomplishment, or when they have

<!-- chunk -->

### a spiritual awakening. Again, it may not last five or more days, but it can

<!-- chunk -->

### occur, which suggests that these brain functions are hardwired into all of

<!-- chunk -->

### our brains.

<!-- chunk -->

### The trauma response is also normal. These symptoms include

<!-- chunk -->

### flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of situations that remind the person

<!-- chunk -->

### of the event, negative effects on mood and thinking (similar to depression),

<!-- chunk -->

### trouble sleeping, being on edge and hyperalert, and other symptoms. One

<!-- chunk -->

### research group studied women shortly after being raped and found that

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of them had these types of symptoms in the first weeks.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, all of

<!-- chunk -->

### these responses can be “normal.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These multifaceted brain adaptations become disorders when they are

<!-- chunk -->

### overactive. They can be activated at the wrong time, last too long, or result

<!-- chunk -->

### in excessive or exaggerated symptoms. In some cases, they can be activated

<!-- chunk -->

### out of the blue for no clear reason—a hyperexcitable activation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### system. In other cases, they can be activated for a clear reason, such as a

<!-- chunk -->

### major stressor in life, but then they fail to inactivate after an appropriate

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of time. They become “stuck” in an “on” position when they should

<!-- chunk -->

### be turning off. This is similar to hyperexcitable pain cells in many pain

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Sometimes they can fire for no clear reason, but other times, the

<!-- chunk -->

### slightest injury or just moving the wrong way can trigger pain.

<!-- chunk -->

## Behavioral Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### Some disorders are seen primarily as behavioral—in particular, substance

<!-- chunk -->

### use and eating disorders. These deserve special attention as well. Recall that

<!-- chunk -->

### they show strong bidirectional relationships with all mental disorders. I

<!-- chunk -->

### have said that mental disorders can be understood broadly as overactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive, or absent brain functions. But these are behaviors . . . ones that

<!-- chunk -->

### people “choose” to engage in. What do these behaviors have to do with the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain malfunctioning?

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three ways to think about it. The first is that eating and using

<!-- chunk -->

### addictive substances are behaviors that are controlled by our brains. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are clear pathways that control cravings, appetite, motivation, self-control,

<!-- chunk -->

### impulsivity, and novelty seeking. So, in some cases, if these parts of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain are overactive or underactive, they might drive people to engage in

<!-- chunk -->

### these behaviors, which can lead to problems. The second possibility is that

<!-- chunk -->

### people may have symptoms of other mental disorders (due to overactive or

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive brain regions) and use alcohol, drugs, or change eating

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors to cope with those symptoms. This is commonly referred to as the

<!-- chunk -->

### self-medication hypothesis. The third possibility is that some people can be

<!-- chunk -->

### perfectly fine and “normal” and begin to engage in these behaviors. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### can start using drugs or alcohol due to peer pressure alone. A person can

<!-- chunk -->

### start dieting due to peer pressure alone. As I will discuss later, all of these

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors can have powerful effects on metabolism and the brain. They can

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to metabolic abnormalities, which can lead to overactivity and

<!-- chunk -->

### underactivity of specific brain functions, that can then trap people in vicious

<!-- chunk -->

### cycles—ones that we call eating disorders and substance use disorders.

# A Complex Puzzle

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the challenges in identifying what causes mental illness is that the

<!-- chunk -->

### findings I’ve mentioned here, such as reduced default-mode network

<!-- chunk -->

### activity leading to depression, are not consistent across people with the

<!-- chunk -->

### same disorder, or even in the same person at different times. Other than in

<!-- chunk -->

### cases of developmental abnormalities or cell death, the symptoms wax and

<!-- chunk -->

### wane, and so can the neuroscience findings. That’s why we don’t yet have

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnostic tests. The developmental abnormalities are not consistent for

<!-- chunk -->

### specific disorders, either. They can affect a wide range of cell types and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain regions in different people, even people diagnosed with the same

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. When looking at brain changes and the way the brain functions in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness, heterogeneity and inconsistent findings are the name of the

<!-- chunk -->

### game.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s a lot to account for. It’s no wonder that the puzzle of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness has been so difficult to solve. What makes different parts of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### overactive or underactive, leading to symptoms of mental illness? What

<!-- chunk -->

### makes the symptoms wax and wane? What exactly is causing these

<!-- chunk -->

### developmental abnormalities or areas of cell shrinkage and death? Why are

<!-- chunk -->

### they different in different people? All of these questions need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### addressed by any theory that tries to account for all mental disorders. I’m

<!-- chunk -->

### excited to share with you that the brain energy theory can do it. And it’s all

<!-- chunk -->

### through one common pathway.


# Magnificent Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### now return to the discussion of metabolism in order to continue to put

<!-- chunk -->

### the pieces of the puzzle together. Recall the traffic analogy from Chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### Five where each car was like a human cell. I described metabolism as

<!-- chunk -->

### very complicated. It’s constantly changing, and may be different in different

<!-- chunk -->

### cells at different times. To be fair, that isn’t really one common pathway. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### more like hundreds of different metabolic pathways.

<!-- chunk -->

### But what controls metabolism? How do food and oxygen know where

<!-- chunk -->

### to go? What changes the metabolic rate in various cells? What makes some

<!-- chunk -->

### cells slow down, while others go faster? What is driving this intricate

<!-- chunk -->

### network of the human body?

<!-- chunk -->

### Some would say it’s the brain. Although the brain plays a critical role in

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, it can’t control metabolism in all the different cells of the body

<!-- chunk -->

### at the correct times. Like city traffic, there must be some degree of control

<!-- chunk -->

### at the level of each car, or in the case of the human body, at the level of

<!-- chunk -->

### each cell. Cells receive input from other cells telling them to stop or go.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cells in close proximity also have signals that make neighboring cells stop

<!-- chunk -->

### or go

<!-- chunk -->

### (think brake lights on a car). But some of the signals are sent all over the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. They might originate in a brain cell or a liver cell, but they then travel

<!-- chunk -->

### long distances to affect cells throughout the body. These processes all lead

<!-- chunk -->

### to a coordination of metabolism, just like city traffic is coordinated on many

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, too.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many things that make city traffic flow. The different types of

<!-- chunk -->

### roads and highways. The different speed limits on different roads. The stop

<!-- chunk -->

### signs and stoplights. These are all important to the organization and flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### city traffic. But in the end, the true and primary force controlling the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### traffic boils down to the drivers in the cars. They know the rules and they

<!-- chunk -->

### follow them. They make the cars go. They make the cars stop. They use

<!-- chunk -->

### turn signals. They look out for trouble. They steer the cars around problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### They drive the cars to their destinations. And even though the drivers don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### know what’s happening with all the other cars on all the other roads or

<!-- chunk -->

### highways, everything works.

<!-- chunk -->

### Do human cells have “drivers” making the cells stop and go? It turns

<!-- chunk -->

### out that they do. The drivers of human cells, and human metabolism, are

<!-- chunk -->

### called mitochondria. And they are the common pathway to mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### If you’ve ever taken a biology course, you likely remember that

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are the “powerhouses of the cell.” Mitochondria make energy

<!-- chunk -->

### for cells by turning food and oxygen into ATP. While there’s no question

<!-- chunk -->

### that their role in energy production is critical, mitochondria are so much

<!-- chunk -->

### more than powerhouses. Without them, life as we know it wouldn’t exist.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the 2005 book Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of

<!-- chunk -->

### Life, Dr. Nick Lane provides a thorough and compelling story of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and their role in human evolution.


<!-- chunk -->

### Although the title might

<!-- chunk -->

### suggest a pop culture quick read, Lane provides a rigorous scientific history

<!-- chunk -->

### of mitochondria and their role in human health and life itself.

# Mitochondrial Origins

<!-- chunk -->

### Once upon a time, the first mitochondrion (mitochondria is the plural of a

<!-- chunk -->

### single mitochondrion) was a bacterium. Researchers estimate mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### evolved from an independent living organism sometime between one and

<!-- chunk -->

### four billion years ago. A 1998 paper published in Nature suggests they

<!-- chunk -->

### share many genes with the modern-day Rickettsia prowazekii, a bacterium

<!-- chunk -->

### that causes typhus.


<!-- chunk -->

### Billions of years ago, another single-cell organism, an

<!-- chunk -->

### archaea, engulfed this ancestral mitochondrion. Instead of the

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrion dying after being engulfed, as usually happens, they both

<!-- chunk -->

### lived. This new organism is thought to have evolved into the first

<!-- chunk -->

### eukaryotic cell (a cell with a nucleus). The inside bacterium began to focus

<!-- chunk -->

### on making energy, and the outside organism could focus on getting food.

<!-- chunk -->

### Make no mistake—this is important. It is not a trivial fact.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thus, before there was a cell nucleus housing human DNA, and before

<!-- chunk -->

### there were other organelles, there was a mitochondrion—a single

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrion and a single host cell. Together, they were determined to

<!-- chunk -->

### survive. Actually, not just survive, but thrive. Like all forms of life—they

<!-- chunk -->

### were in it to win it. And win it they did!

<!-- chunk -->

### Over time, it was this symbiotic arrangement that allowed for

<!-- chunk -->

### multicellular life—essentially all life that we can see with our eyes today. In

<!-- chunk -->

### all eukaryotes, these internal bacteria evolved into mitochondria. In plants

<!-- chunk -->

### and algae (also eukaryotes), some of them also evolved into what we now

<!-- chunk -->

### call chloroplasts. Although mitochondria and chloroplasts have different

<!-- chunk -->

### names, they look and function similarly, and they are thought to be

<!-- chunk -->

### descended from the same bacterium from billions of years ago.

<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, it’s believed that this merger happened only once, and that all

<!-- chunk -->

### plants, animals, algae, and fungi that exist today descended from this same

<!-- chunk -->

### organism. For those who believe in God, this concept of a single event

<!-- chunk -->

### starting life as we know it might be reassuring. For those who don’t believe

<!-- chunk -->

### in God, it was just one of those unusual and unlikely events that shaped

<!-- chunk -->

### evolution for billions of years to come. Regardless of what you believe, it

<!-- chunk -->

### was an important event in the story of life.

<!-- chunk -->

### In evolution, being first matters. For example, when genes overlap among

<!-- chunk -->

### different organisms, they are usually believed to be more important than

<!-- chunk -->

### genes that are unique to specific species. The unique genes are thought to

<!-- chunk -->

### have occurred more recently in the evolutionary timeline, while the

<!-- chunk -->

### common genes developed much earlier. Things that have persisted for a

<!-- chunk -->

### long time are thought to be more essential to life. There are at least two

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons for this. The first is that evolution tends to get rid of things that are

<!-- chunk -->

### not essential or don’t confer some advantage in terms of survival or

<!-- chunk -->

### reproduction. If organisms evolve to no longer need a trait, it will no longer

<!-- chunk -->

### be selected for and will often eventually disappear. The second is that new

<!-- chunk -->

### genes and traits must develop with and adapt to the genes and traits that are

<!-- chunk -->

### already there. Mitochondria were in eukaryotic cells first. Initially, it was

<!-- chunk -->

### just a single bacterium and a single outside cell. Over time, the nucleus and

<!-- chunk -->

### other organelles developed. As important as these other organelles are,

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria were there first. They likely influenced the development of

<!-- chunk -->

### these other cell parts and became indispensable. In fact, these other cell

<!-- chunk -->

### parts don’t work correctly without mitochondria.

# Modern Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are no longer able to replicate themselves outside of a

<!-- chunk -->

### eukaryotic cell. In humans, mitochondria transferred most of their DNA to

<!-- chunk -->

### the cell’s nucleus, where human DNA resides. There are about 1,500

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial genes that are now embedded within human DNA. These

<!-- chunk -->

### 1,500 genes make proteins that are required to either create or maintain

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, and these proteins are shared with all the mitochondria in the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell. However, mitochondria didn’t give up all their DNA. Each one of them

<!-- chunk -->

### still has thirty-seven genes. Individual mitochondria can use that DNA on

<!-- chunk -->

### their own—and thus mitochondria maintain some degree of independence,

<!-- chunk -->

### both from each other and from the cell in which they reside. This is highly

<!-- chunk -->

### unusual in biology, and its purpose is the subject of debate. The point,

<!-- chunk -->

### however, is this: Mitochondria and human cells are now 100 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### committed to each other. Neither can survive without the other.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are tiny. On average, each human cell has about three to four

<!-- chunk -->

### hundred mitochondria.


<!-- chunk -->

### This means that there are about ten million billion

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in the human body. They make up about 10 percent of our

<!-- chunk -->

### body weight despite their tiny size. In metabolically demanding cells—such

<!-- chunk -->

### as brain cells—a single cell can contain thousands of mitochondria, with

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria making up 40-plus percent of the cell volume.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are busy. Although small amounts of ATP can be

<!-- chunk -->

### produced without mitochondria through a process called glycolysis,

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria produce the lion’s share of ATP, especially for brain cells. In

<!-- chunk -->

### the average human adult, they make about 9 ×


<!-- chunk -->

### ATP molecules every

<!-- chunk -->

### second.


<!-- chunk -->

### One group of researchers looked at brain cells using specialized

<!-- chunk -->

### imaging techniques and found that a single neuron in the human brain uses

<!-- chunk -->

### about 4.7 billion ATP molecules every second.


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s a lot of ATP!

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria move. This is a fairly recent discovery based on new

<!-- chunk -->

### techniques for studying living cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### When a cell is dead under the

<!-- chunk -->

### microscope, nothing moves, so it’s easy to see why researchers didn’t think

<!-- chunk -->

### that mitochondria would be mobile. Other organelles typically are not. The

<!-- chunk -->

### finding that mitochondria actually move around living cells was highly

<!-- chunk -->

### unexpected. If you’d like to see a video of mitochondria moving, you can

<!-- chunk -->

### see them in the PLOS Biology article in the endnotes.


<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other

<!-- chunk -->

### videos available online. There is a network of microtubules and filaments

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the cell, often referred to as the cytoskeleton, that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### use for their movement. There are many mechanisms involved, which are

<!-- chunk -->

### beyond our scope, but the point is simple—some mitochondria move

<!-- chunk -->

### around.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, it appears that not all mitochondria are moving. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### stay in one place, while others move.

<!-- chunk -->

### Why are they moving? Well, one reason is that they appear to go to the

<!-- chunk -->

### places in the cell where things are happening and where energy is needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy needs to be produced in the right amount, in the right place, at the

<!-- chunk -->

### right time, and it goes through an unimaginably fast recycling process that

<!-- chunk -->

### involves mitochondria. The mitochondria that aren’t moving appear to stay

<!-- chunk -->

### in places where things are always happening—either near factories where

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins are made (ribosomes) or synapses where there is a lot of activity,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is a very important fact relevant to how the brain functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers looking at brain cells under microscopes have known for

<!-- chunk -->

### decades how to identify where the synapses are—they look for the


<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are rapid recyclers. ATP is the energy currency of human

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. When it is used as energy, a phosphate group is removed, which turns

<!-- chunk -->

### it into adenosine diphosphate, or ADP. This ADP can’t supply much energy

<!-- chunk -->

### anymore, but if a phosphate group is added back to it, it’s as good as new.

<!-- chunk -->

### That’s what mitochondria do. They take ADP and turn it back into ATP by

<!-- chunk -->

### attaching a phosphate group, then transfer it out to the cell cytoplasm where

<!-- chunk -->

### it is needed. They give one ATP and recycle one ADP simultaneously. If

<!-- chunk -->

### there is a lot of activity in a particular part of the cell, you will find

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria there. They have to provide the ATP, but they also suck up all

<!-- chunk -->

### of the ADP and recycle it. You can think about mitochondria as little

<!-- chunk -->

### vacuum cleaners, going around the cell and sucking up ADP and churning

<!-- chunk -->

### out ATP.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember that I said there were billions of ATP molecules being used

<!-- chunk -->

### every second in just one brain cell? Well, if there isn’t a mitochondrion or

<!-- chunk -->

### two (well . . . maybe more than that) in the right place at the right time to

<!-- chunk -->

### both deliver all that ATP and recycle all the ADP, things will back up

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly and either slow down or stop working.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, mitochondrial movement is more important than just making

<!-- chunk -->

### sure enough energy is supplied in the right place at the right time. It’s also

<!-- chunk -->

### related to mitochondrial interactions with other organelles and with each

<!-- chunk -->

### other. These interactions are critically important to almost all cell functions

<!-- chunk -->

### and even gene expression.

<!-- chunk -->

### To demonstrate the role of mitochondria, I’ll first need to review some

<!-- chunk -->

### basic information on how neurons work. Although the function of any cell

<!-- chunk -->

### is complicated, and brain cells even more so, there are some basics that are

<!-- chunk -->

### directly regulated by mitochondria. Better understanding them will allow

<!-- chunk -->

### me to tie metabolism and mitochondria to distinct functions of brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ll use the next chapter to explain how all the symptoms of mental illness

<!-- chunk -->

### are directly related to mitochondria and metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurons have a resting membrane potential. Basically, this means that

<!-- chunk -->

### the inside of the cell has a negative charge compared to the outside of the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell. This charge is critically important to the function of the cell. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### created by ion pumps, which pump sodium, potassium, calcium, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### ions either inside or outside of the cell, or between compartments within the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell. These pumps all require energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cells do a lot of ion pumping in order to set themselves up to be ready

<!-- chunk -->

### to fire. When the cell is triggered, it sets off a cascade of events that results

<!-- chunk -->

### in the cell doing its thing, whether that entails releasing a neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### or a hormone, or doing something else. It’s like setting up a row of

<!-- chunk -->

### dominoes. It takes time and work to set them up, but it’s easy to push them

<!-- chunk -->

### all over by simply nudging one of them. Once they all fall down, they need

<!-- chunk -->

### to be set up again. That requires more work. Mitochondria provide almost

<!-- chunk -->

### all the energy needed to do all of this.

# What Else Do Mitochondria Do?

<!-- chunk -->

### Calcium levels play an important role in the function of cells. High levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium in the cytoplasm can trigger all sorts of things to happen. In many

<!-- chunk -->

### ways, calcium is an “on/off” switch. When levels are high, the cell is “on.”

<!-- chunk -->

### When levels are low, the cell gets turned “off.” Mitochondria are directly

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in calcium regulation. When mitochondria are prevented from

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning properly, calcium regulation is disrupted—and this important

<!-- chunk -->

### “off” switch can be as well.


<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, mitochondria are essential in

<!-- chunk -->

### turning cells both on and off. They provide the energy needed for ion

<!-- chunk -->

### pumping, and they also regulate the calcium levels that function as essential

<!-- chunk -->

### on/off signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Energy and mitochondria are required to turn cells both on and off. This

<!-- chunk -->

### may seem paradoxical, but it will make more sense if you think of the “off”

<!-- chunk -->

### switch as electronic brakes on a car that require energy to work. Without

<!-- chunk -->

### enough energy to apply the brakes fully and quickly at appropriate times,

<!-- chunk -->

### the car can become impossible to control and cause major disruptions in the

<!-- chunk -->

### flow of traffic. These dichotomous consequences of metabolic and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction are important to understand. Some cells will stay

<!-- chunk -->

### on

<!-- chunk -->

### too long when they are energy deprived, while other cells will fail to work. I

<!-- chunk -->

### will come back to this soon enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### Turning cells on and off is critically important. Understanding this

<!-- chunk -->

### function will help us explain most of the symptoms of mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, mitochondria actually do much more than that. Their role in

<!-- chunk -->

### human health is a cutting-edge, vigorous area of research that spans almost

<!-- chunk -->

### every field in medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s outline some of the other roles that mitochondria play that are

<!-- chunk -->

### important to their relationship with mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Help Regulate Metabolism Broadly

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2001, a peptide called humanin was first reported to have broad effects

<!-- chunk -->

### on metabolism and health.


<!-- chunk -->

### The gene for this peptide appears to reside on

<!-- chunk -->

### both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA. It was first discovered in

<!-- chunk -->

### research on Alzheimer’s disease. Since its discovery, two other peptides,

<!-- chunk -->

### MOTS-c and SHLP1–6, have been discovered and added to a new class of

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules called mitochondrially derived peptides. The genes for these

<!-- chunk -->

### peptides are on mitochondrial DNA, and these peptides are produced by

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. They are now of great interest to researchers. They have been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to have beneficial effects on illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### strokes, diabetes, heart attacks, and certain types of cancer. They also have

<!-- chunk -->

### broad effects on metabolism, cell survival, and inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

### existence of these peptides suggests that mitochondria are able to

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate with each other through these peptide signals in order to

<!-- chunk -->

### regulate metabolism throughout the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Help Produce and Regulate Neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters have been a primary focus in the mental health field. It

<!-- chunk -->

### turns out that mitochondria play critical roles in their production, secretion,

<!-- chunk -->

### and overall regulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurons often have one specific neurotransmitter that they specialize in

<!-- chunk -->

### making. Some make serotonin. Others make dopamine. The process of

<!-- chunk -->

### making a neurotransmitter takes energy and building blocks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria provide both. They play a direct role in the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### acetylcholine, glutamate, norepinephrine, dopamine, GABA, and

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin.


<!-- chunk -->

### Once made, neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles, or little

<!-- chunk -->

### bubbles, until they are ready to use. Vesicles filled with neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### travel down the axon to get to their ultimate release site. That takes energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The signal to release neurotransmitters depends upon the resting membrane

<!-- chunk -->

### potential and calcium levels that I discussed. Once that signal comes, the

<!-- chunk -->

### actual release of neurotransmitters also takes energy. Fascinatingly, once

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters are released at one location, the mitochondria move to

<!-- chunk -->

### another location of the cell membrane to release a new batch of

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters.


<!-- chunk -->

### Once released, neurotransmitters have their effect on

<!-- chunk -->

### the target tissue, whether it’s another nerve, muscle, or gland cell. After

<!-- chunk -->

### they are released from the receptors on the target cell, they are sucked back

<!-- chunk -->

### into the axon terminals (a process called reuptake), and you guessed it, that

<!-- chunk -->

### takes energy. They are then repackaged back into vesicles for the next

<!-- chunk -->

### round—yet more energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are normally found in large supply at synapses. When

<!-- chunk -->

### they are prevented from getting to the synapses, neurotransmitters don’t get

<!-- chunk -->

### released, even if there is ATP present.


<!-- chunk -->

### When mitochondria aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning properly, neurotransmitters can become imbalanced. Given that

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters are an important way for nerve cells to communicate with

<!-- chunk -->

### each other, imbalances can disrupt normal brain functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### The role of mitochondria in regulating neurotransmitters goes much

<!-- chunk -->

### further than just their involvement in synthesis, release, and reuptake.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria actually have receptors for some neurotransmitters, indicating

<!-- chunk -->

### a feedback cycle between neurotransmitters and mitochondria. They also

<!-- chunk -->

### have some of the enzymes involved in the breakdown of neurotransmitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as monoamine oxidase. They are involved in regulating the release of

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA, and they actually store GABA within themselves.


<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, several

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters are known to regulate mitochondrial function, production,

<!-- chunk -->

### and growth. Clearly, neurotransmitters are much more than just messengers

<!-- chunk -->

### between cells impacting mood. They are essential regulators of metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria themselves. I’ll come back to this later.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Help Regulate Immune System Function

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria also play an essential role in immune system function.


<!-- chunk -->

### This

<!-- chunk -->

### includes fighting off viruses and bacteria, but it also includes low-grade

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, something that has been found in most metabolic and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders to some degree. Mitochondria help regulate how immune cells

<!-- chunk -->

### engage with immune receptors. When cells are highly stressed, they often

<!-- chunk -->

### release components of mitochondria, which serve as a danger signal to the

<!-- chunk -->

### rest of the body, one that activates chronic, low-grade inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

### One study looked at specific types of immune cells called macrophages

<!-- chunk -->

### to see how these cells coordinate the complicated repair processes in wound

<!-- chunk -->

### healing. The cells do different things during different phases of healing. Up

<!-- chunk -->

### until this study, it wasn’t known how the cells know when and how to

<!-- chunk -->

### change between phases. The researchers found that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### specifically controlled these processes.


<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Help Regulate Stress Responses

<!-- chunk -->

### We now know that mitochondria help control and coordinate the stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response in the human body. This includes both physical and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### stressors. Physical stressors include things like starvation, infection, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### lack of oxygen. Mental stressors are anything that threatens or challenges us

<!-- chunk -->

### (as talked about in the previous chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

### When cells are physically stressed, they initiate a process called the

<!-- chunk -->

### integrated stress response. This is a coordinated effort by the cell to adapt

<!-- chunk -->

### to and survive adverse circumstances through changes in metabolism, gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression, and other adaptations. Many lines of research show that

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial stress itself leads to the integrated stress response.


<!-- chunk -->

### If the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell isn’t able to manage the stress, one of two things happens—it either

<!-- chunk -->

### triggers its own death, a process called apoptosis, or it enters into a

<!-- chunk -->

### “zombielike” state called senescence, which has been associated with aging

<!-- chunk -->

### and many health problems, such as cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

### Up until recently, it wasn’t known how the different aspects of the

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological stress response are all coordinated in the body and brain. It

<!-- chunk -->

### turns out that mitochondria play a critically important role! One brilliant

<!-- chunk -->

### study by Dr. Martin Picard and colleagues demonstrated this, and its title

<!-- chunk -->

### says it all: “Mitochondrial functions modulate neuroendocrine, metabolic,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory, and transcriptional responses to acute psychological

<!-- chunk -->

### stress.”


<!-- chunk -->

### These researchers were studying mice and genetically

<!-- chunk -->

### manipulated their mitochondria to see what effects these manipulations had

<!-- chunk -->

### on the stress response. They manipulated only four different genes—two

<!-- chunk -->

### located in mitochondria themselves and two located in the cell nucleus that

<!-- chunk -->

### code for proteins used exclusively in mitochondria. Each genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### manipulation resulted in different problems with mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, even with only four manipulations, they found that all the stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response factors were affected. This included changes in cortisol levels, the

<!-- chunk -->

### sympathetic nervous system, adrenaline levels, inflammation, markers of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, and gene expression in the hippocampus. Their conclusion was

<!-- chunk -->

### that mitochondria are directly involved in controlling all these stress

<!-- chunk -->

### responses, and if mitochondria aren’t functioning properly, these stress

<!-- chunk -->

### responses are altered.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Are Involved in Making, Releasing, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Responding to Hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are key regulators of hormones. Cells that make hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### require more energy than most. They synthesize the hormones, package

<!-- chunk -->

### them up, and release them, just as I described for neurotransmitters. It takes

<!-- chunk -->

### a lot of ATP to do this, and mitochondria are there to deliver it.

<!-- chunk -->

### For some hormones, mitochondria are even more important—this

<!-- chunk -->

### includes well-known names like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone. The

<!-- chunk -->

### enzymes required for initiating the production of these hormones are found

<!-- chunk -->

### only in mitochondria. Without mitochondria, these hormones aren’t made.

<!-- chunk -->

### But there’s more. Mitochondria in other cells sometimes have receptors for

<!-- chunk -->

### these hormones. So, in some cases, these hormones can begin in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in one type of cell and end with mitochondria in another type

<!-- chunk -->

### of cell.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Create Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Help

<!-- chunk -->

## Clean It Up

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria burn fuel—either carbohydrates, fats, or protein. Burning fuel

<!-- chunk -->

### can sometimes create waste products. When mitochondria burn fuel,

<!-- chunk -->

### electrons flow along the electron transport chain. These electrons are a

<!-- chunk -->

### source of energy usually used to make either ATP or heat. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes these electrons leak outside of the usual system. When they do,

<!-- chunk -->

### they form what are called reactive oxygen species (ROS).


<!-- chunk -->

### These include

<!-- chunk -->

### molecules such as superoxide anion (O


<!-- chunk -->

### -), hydrogen peroxide (H


<!-- chunk -->

### O


<!-- chunk -->

### ),

<!-- chunk -->

### hydroxyl radical (•OH), and organic peroxides. At one point, researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### believed ROS were simply toxic waste products. We now know small

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts of ROS actually serve a useful signaling process inside the cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, a 2016 paper published in Nature found that ROS were the

<!-- chunk -->

### primary regulators of heat production and energy expenditure—a broad

<!-- chunk -->

### measure of metabolic rate.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, large amounts of ROS are toxic and

<!-- chunk -->

### result in inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

### You may have heard the term oxidative stress—

<!-- chunk -->

### that’s what this is! ROS are known to cause damage to mitochondria and

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. They are associated with aging and many diseases. Given that ROS

<!-- chunk -->

### are produced right in the mitochondria and are highly reactive, they often

<!-- chunk -->

### damage mitochondria first. The mitochondrial DNA is unprotected, so large

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts of ROS are known to result in mitochondrial DNA mutations.

<!-- chunk -->

### These ROS can also damage the mitochondrial machinery itself. If they

<!-- chunk -->

### leak outside of the mitochondria, they can damage many different parts of

<!-- chunk -->

### the cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Additionally, mitochondria serve as ROS janitors. As well as producing

<!-- chunk -->

### ROS, mitochondria also clean up some of it up through an elaborate system

<!-- chunk -->

### of enzymes and other factors that serve to detoxify ROS.


<!-- chunk -->

### Cells have other

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant systems, too, but mitochondria play a role. When this

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification system fails, these ROS waste products can pile up and cause

<!-- chunk -->

### damage. This can lead to cellular dysfunction, otherwise known as aging,

<!-- chunk -->

### cell death, and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Are Shape-Shifters

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria change shape in response to different environmental factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes they are long and thin. Other times they are short and

<!-- chunk -->

### fat. Sometimes they are round. In addition to changing shape, they interact

<!-- chunk -->

### with each other in profound ways. They can merge to make just one

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrion—a process called fusion. They can divide and form two

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria—a process called fission. These changes in shape are very

<!-- chunk -->

### important to cell function. In 2013, two articles published in the journal

<!-- chunk -->

### Cell showed that the process of mitochondria fusing with each other

<!-- chunk -->

### significantly impacts fat storage, eating behaviors, and obesity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial changes in shape and their fusion with each other appear to

<!-- chunk -->

### create signals that can affect the entire human body. When mitochondria are

<!-- chunk -->

### prevented from doing these things, metabolic problems ensue, not just in

<!-- chunk -->

### the cells affected, but sometimes throughout the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Play a Primary Role in Gene Expression

<!-- chunk -->

### Nuclear DNA is where the human genome resides. It’s contained within the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell nucleus. Researchers once thought that genes controlled everything

<!-- chunk -->

### about the human body. They assumed that the nucleus was the control

<!-- chunk -->

### center of the cell. We now know that it’s not always about the genes

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves, but more about what causes certain genes to turn on or off. This

<!-- chunk -->

### is the field of epigenetics.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are primary regulators of epigenetics. They send signals

<!-- chunk -->

### to the nuclear DNA in several different ways. This is sometimes referred to

<!-- chunk -->

### as the retrograde response.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has long been known that the ratio of ATP to ADP, levels of ROS, and

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium levels can all affect gene expression. As you now know, these are

<!-- chunk -->

### all directly related to mitochondrial function. However, given that these are

<!-- chunk -->

### also markers of general cellular health and function, no one thought too

<!-- chunk -->

### much of it. They certainly didn’t think of it as a way for mitochondria to

<!-- chunk -->

### directly control the expression of genes in the nucleus.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2002, it was discovered that mitochondria are required for the

<!-- chunk -->

### transport of an important epigenetic factor, nuclear protein histone H1.


<!-- chunk -->

### This protein helps regulate gene expression and is transported from the

<!-- chunk -->

### cytoplasm to the nucleus, a process that requires ATP. Researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered, however, that ATP alone isn’t enough. Mitochondria must be

<!-- chunk -->

### present in order for this transfer to occur. Without mitochondria, this

<!-- chunk -->

### transfer doesn’t happen.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2013, it was discovered that mitochondrial ROS directly inactivate an

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme called histone demethylase Rph1p, which regulates epigenetic gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression in the cell nucleus.


<!-- chunk -->

### This process was found to play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### extending lifespan in yeast and is thought to possibly play a role in humans

<!-- chunk -->

### as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2018, two additional studies demonstrated even more of a role for

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in gene expression. The first was a report by molecular

<!-- chunk -->

### biologist Maria Dafne Cardamone and colleagues showing that a protein,

<!-- chunk -->

### GPS2, is released by mitochondria in response to metabolic stress.


<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolic stress can be caused by a lot of different things, but starvation is

<!-- chunk -->

### a clear example. After GPS2 is released by mitochondria, it enters the cell

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleus and regulates a number of genes related to mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis and metabolic stress.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another group of researchers, Dr. Kyung Hwa Kim and colleagues,

<!-- chunk -->

### found another mitochondrial protein, MOTS-c, that is coded for by

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial DNA and plays a role in gene expression.


<!-- chunk -->

### This was very

<!-- chunk -->

### unexpected. Up until about twenty years ago, everyone assumed that

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial DNA was just about machinery needed for ATP production.

<!-- chunk -->

### MOTS-c gets produced in response to metabolic stress as well. After

<!-- chunk -->

### MOTS-c is produced in the mitochondria, it makes its way into the nucleus

<!-- chunk -->

### and binds to the nuclear DNA. This results in the regulation of a broad

<!-- chunk -->

### range of genes—ones related to stress responses, metabolism, and

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, and most spectacularly, Dr. Martin Picard and colleagues

<!-- chunk -->

### experimentally manipulated the number of mitochondria with mutations in

<!-- chunk -->

### cells and found that as they increased the number of dysfunctional

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, more epigenetic problems and changes occurred.


<!-- chunk -->

### impact was on almost all of the genes expressed in the cells. Ultimately, in

<!-- chunk -->

### situations in which almost all the mitochondria were dysfunctional, the cells

<!-- chunk -->

### died. This study provided evidence that mitochondria are not just involved

<!-- chunk -->

### in the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, but possibly in the

<!-- chunk -->

### expression of all genes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Can Multiply

<!-- chunk -->

### Under the right circumstances, cells will make more mitochondria—a

<!-- chunk -->

### process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Some cells end up with a lot of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. These cells can produce more energy and function at a higher

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity. It is widely believed that the greater the number of healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in a cell, the healthier the cell. We know that the number of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria decreases with age. We also know that the number of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria decreases with many diseases. People who are considered the

<!-- chunk -->

### “fittest” among us—athletic champions—have more mitochondria than

<!-- chunk -->

### most, and their mitochondria appear to be healthier.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Are Involved in Cell Growth and Differentiation

<!-- chunk -->

### Cell growth and differentiation is a complicated process during which a

<!-- chunk -->

### generic stem cell becomes a specialized cell. Differentiation means that the

<!-- chunk -->

### cells become different from each other and take on specialized roles. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### become heart cells. Others become brain cells. Within the brain, different

<!-- chunk -->

### cells take on varying roles. Brain cells change throughout life. Some form

<!-- chunk -->

### new synapses. Some prune unnecessary parts. Some grow and expand when

<!-- chunk -->

### needed. This is neuroplasticity.

<!-- chunk -->

### This process of growth and differentiation involves activation of

<!-- chunk -->

### specific genes in the right cells at the right times. It also involves many

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling pathways. Lastly, it involves the production of building blocks for

<!-- chunk -->

### new cells and new cell parts, balanced with energy needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### It has long been known that mitochondria are essential to cell growth

<!-- chunk -->

### and differentiation. Most researchers assumed it was simply a matter of

<!-- chunk -->

### their powerhouse function since cell growth and differentiation require

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. Recent research, however, strongly suggests a much more active

<!-- chunk -->

### role. Their regulation of calcium levels and other signaling pathways are

<!-- chunk -->

### essential to this process.


<!-- chunk -->

### Their fusion with each other appears to send

<!-- chunk -->

### signals that activate genes in the nucleus. When mitochondria are prevented

<!-- chunk -->

### from fusing with each other, the cells don’t develop correctly.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other

<!-- chunk -->

### research has shown that mitochondrial growth and maturation is essential to

<!-- chunk -->

### proper cell differentiation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Still other research has shown a direct and

<!-- chunk -->

### essential role of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in the development of brain cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### The bottom line is that

<!-- chunk -->

### cells don’t develop normally when mitochondria aren’t functioning

<!-- chunk -->

### properly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Help Maintain Existing Cells

<!-- chunk -->

### In the previous chapter, I discussed autophagy and cell maintenance. It

<!-- chunk -->

### turns out that mitochondria are directly involved in this process, too. They

<!-- chunk -->

### generate many of the signals, such as ROS and other metabolic factors, that

<!-- chunk -->

### play a key role in autophagy. They also interact with other parts of the cell,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as lysosomes, that are involved in the process. Maintenance work

<!-- chunk -->

### takes energy and building blocks as well, and mitochondria are there to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide both.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria appear to be in a complicated feedback cycle with

<!-- chunk -->

### autophagy, as dysfunctional mitochondria can be removed and replaced

<!-- chunk -->

### with healthy mitochondria in a process known as mitophagy. Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### can be beneficiaries of autophagy, but they also play a role in stimulating

<!-- chunk -->

### autophagy more broadly for the entire cell.


<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Eliminate Old and Damaged Cells

<!-- chunk -->

### Cells die every day. There are two well-known types of cell death—

<!-- chunk -->

### necrosis and apoptosis. Necrosis occurs when a cell is abruptly killed, such

<!-- chunk -->

### as a heart cell dying during a heart attack. Necrosis is a bad thing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Apoptosis occurs when cells get old or damaged. Apoptosis is a planned

<!-- chunk -->

### process often referred to as programmed cell death—the signal to die

<!-- chunk -->

### actually comes from the cell itself. Overall, apoptosis is seen as an

<!-- chunk -->

### extraordinarily good thing for human health and survival. It allows old cells

<!-- chunk -->

### to be replaced by new ones. It eliminates damaged cells that might turn into

<!-- chunk -->

### cancer. Every day, about ten billion cells in the human body die and are

<!-- chunk -->

### replaced by new ones.


<!-- chunk -->

### It was once thought that genes in the nucleus controlled apoptosis. We

<!-- chunk -->

### now know that’s not true. It’s mitochondria. When mitochondria experience

<!-- chunk -->

### high levels of stress and accumulate large amounts of ROS, they begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### degrade. When this happens, they release a protein called cytochrome c,

<!-- chunk -->

### which then activates what are called “killing enzymes”—the caspases.

<!-- chunk -->

### These enzymes degrade everything in the cell until it dies. Many of the cell

<!-- chunk -->

### parts get recycled.

<!-- chunk -->

### Autophagy and apoptosis are somewhat related, but they are different

<!-- chunk -->

### processes. Autophagy is usually about repairing and replacing parts within a

<!-- chunk -->

### cell, but the cell usually remains alive. Apoptosis is the death of an entire

<!-- chunk -->

### cell. Nonetheless, they are both required for health and longevity, and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria play a role in both.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are even more types of cell death, beyond the scope of this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nonetheless, one review was able to link all of them to the functions of


# Putting It All Together

<!-- chunk -->

### Change is hard. Models, practices, and conceptual frameworks are difficult

<!-- chunk -->

### to shift. But what if our ideas about the control of cells have been all

<!-- chunk -->

### wrong?

<!-- chunk -->

### If we go back to our automotive analogy, I suggested that each cell was

<!-- chunk -->

### like a car in the congested traffic of a large city. If we look inside that car,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are many drivers—all the mitochondria. It might be easier to change

<!-- chunk -->

### the metaphor at this level and think of the inside of each cell as a factory.

<!-- chunk -->

### The factory receives supplies, such as glucose, amino acids, and oxygen,

<!-- chunk -->

### and performs a function. Some make neurotransmitters. Others make

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones. Some are muscle cells and cause the body to move.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are the workers inside those factories (mitochondria as

<!-- chunk -->

### workers is an analogy Nick Lane used in his book as well).


<!-- chunk -->

### There are

<!-- chunk -->

### many different roles and tasks for them. Some mitochondria help with the

<!-- chunk -->

### production and release of hormones or neurotransmitters. Others serve as

<!-- chunk -->

### janitors—helping to clean up ROS and other debris. Some help

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate with the nucleus—sending signals to turn genes on or off.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are the regulators of calcium, ROS, and other important signals in

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. They work together and communicate with each other—they fuse

<!-- chunk -->

### with each other, move around cells, and communicate with mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### other cells through hormones, such as cortisol, and through other

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanisms, such as mitochondrially derived peptides. And of course, they

<!-- chunk -->

### provide most of the power—or ATP—to make the factory work. When

<!-- chunk -->

### workers in one cell aren’t doing well, they not only affect

<!-- chunk -->

### the rest of the workforce in that cell, but they can also affect the workers in

<!-- chunk -->

### other cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the past twenty years, a lot of the new evidence on the role of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in the cell has been shocking and unexpected. Almost no one

<!-- chunk -->

### thought that mitochondria could control the regulation of genes in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleus—both on a daily basis and during cell growth and differentiation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their interaction with and regulation of other organelles, such as the

<!-- chunk -->

### endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, were also surprising. They were

<!-- chunk -->

### usually thought of as relatively insignificant, and very small, ATP factories.

<!-- chunk -->

### They were sometimes described as “little batteries.” Many researchers still

<!-- chunk -->

### see them this way.

<!-- chunk -->

### For centuries, researchers have been trying to figure out how cells work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Up until recently, they have focused primarily on all the big parts of cells

<!-- chunk -->

### and largely ignored the tiny little mitochondria. Many still think the

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleus, with its coveted human genome, is the control center. Others think

<!-- chunk -->

### that it’s all about the outside cell membrane and the different receptors that

<!-- chunk -->

### are embedded into it. Different neurotransmitters or hormones make cells

<!-- chunk -->

### do things. What if both takes have some truth in them, but the real story is

<!-- chunk -->

### about the mitochondria—the workers? Given all the roles that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### play in so many different aspects of cell function, is it possible that they are

<!-- chunk -->

### the real answer to understanding how cells work? What if all the different

<!-- chunk -->

### organelles in a cell are just big machines or storage sites to be used by

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria to do different tasks in a cell? Could the nucleus simply be a

<!-- chunk -->

### large storage center for the DNA, the blueprints of the cell, to be used when

<!-- chunk -->

### called for by the mitochondria? Could the other organelles be large

<!-- chunk -->

### machines, ones that make proteins (ribosomes) or waste disposal machines

<!-- chunk -->

### (lysosomes), to be used by the mitochondria for these different purposes?

<!-- chunk -->

### After all, mitochondria are the only organelles that move around the cell,

<!-- chunk -->

### interact with each other, and interact with all the other organelles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria were in the cell first. They were the first organelle. They were

<!-- chunk -->

### also an independent living organism at one point. In many ways, the

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence can’t rule this out.

<!-- chunk -->

### To be clear, I’m not suggesting that mitochondria have brains and make

<!-- chunk -->

### independent decisions on all of these functions. Instead, I am suggesting

<!-- chunk -->

### that they are like little robotic workers, doing what they are programmed to

<!-- chunk -->

### do. They are longtime, loyal servants to human cells. But like so many

<!-- chunk -->

### unappreciated servants and workers, maybe they deserve a little more

<!-- chunk -->

### respect and recognition for all that they do.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whether you like this analogy or not, even if you want to continue to

<!-- chunk -->

### think of mitochondria as nothing more than little batteries, one thing is

<!-- chunk -->

### abundantly clear and uncontroversial—when mitochondria aren’t working,

<!-- chunk -->

### neither is the human body or brain.


# A Brain Energy Imbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### n the previous chapter, I reviewed mitochondria in all their glory. Their

<!-- chunk -->

### function affects every cell in the human body. Their involvement in all

<!-- chunk -->

### aspects of cell function, neurotransmitters, hormones, inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### immune system function, regulation of gene expression, development, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the maintenance and health of cells results in widespread effects throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### the body and the brain. They are the drivers of cells and metabolism. They

<!-- chunk -->

### are the workforce of the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the question remains: Do we have evidence that metabolic problems

<!-- chunk -->

### are related to mental disorders? And how?

<!-- chunk -->

### Yes! There is an abundance of evidence that links problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism to mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I discussed in Chapter Five, physicians and researchers have known

<!-- chunk -->

### for well over a century that mental disorders appear to be linked to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders, such as diabetes. Direct evidence of metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities in people with mental disorders, even those who don’t yet

<!-- chunk -->

### have obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, dates back to at least the

<!-- chunk -->

### 1950s. Among the abnormalities found in markers of metabolism:

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### ATP, redox markers (the balance between oxidants, such as ROS, and

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidants), hormones, neurotransmitters, and lactate (a marker of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic stress). In the 1980s, it was discovered that infusing lactate into

<!-- chunk -->

### the vein of a person with panic disorder would often precipitate an

<!-- chunk -->

### immediate panic attack.


<!-- chunk -->

### As I already discussed, cortisol dysregulation also

<!-- chunk -->

### seems to play a role, at least in some people, and this is a metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neuroimaging studies have provided an overwhelming amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence for metabolic differences in the brains of people with mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared

<!-- chunk -->

### spectroscopic imaging (NIRSI) can measure localized changes in cerebral

<!-- chunk -->

### blood flow related to neural activity, which is an indirect marker of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and brain activity. Positron emission tomography (PET), blood-

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen-level-dependent imaging (BOLD), and single-photon emission

<!-- chunk -->

### computed tomography (SPECT) all measure some metric of metabolism—

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of glucose, oxygen, or a radioactive molecule that researchers inject

<!-- chunk -->

### into a person’s vein. All these imaging studies are measuring metabolism in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain because metabolism is a marker of brain activity. When neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### are active, they use more energy. When they are resting, they use less.

<!-- chunk -->

### These studies have provided us with a plethora of data demonstrating

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in the brains of people with mental disorders compared to the

<!-- chunk -->

### brains of healthy controls. Some brain regions are overactive, while other

<!-- chunk -->

### brain regions are underactive. More recently, researchers have turned to

<!-- chunk -->

### functional brain connectivity studies, which look at the interactions of two

<!-- chunk -->

### or more brain regions in attempts to determine which of those regions

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate with each other to perform specific tasks. However, even with

<!-- chunk -->

### all this research, heterogeneity and inconsistent findings have been the

<!-- chunk -->

### name of the game. If you don’t believe me, the American Psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### Association published a “Resource Document on Neuroimaging” in 2018 in

<!-- chunk -->

### which they concluded: “There are currently no brain imaging biomarkers

<!-- chunk -->

### that are clinically useful for any diagnostic category in psychiatry.”


<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers doing this neuroimaging work, however, have known

<!-- chunk -->

### for decades that there are differences in metabolism in the brains of people

<!-- chunk -->

### with mental disorders. At first glance, they may think that the theory of

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy offers nothing new. “Obviously mental disorders are related to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism! We’ve known that all along! Metabolism is everything in

<!-- chunk -->

### biology. What’s new here?”

<!-- chunk -->

### As I hope you’ll come to understand, there is something new here. And

<!-- chunk -->

### not just new, but revolutionary. While these researchers have been lost in

<!-- chunk -->

### the overwhelming complexity of metabolism and how the brain works,

<!-- chunk -->

### trying to figure out what is making some brain regions overactive and other

<!-- chunk -->

### brain regions underactive, they have failed to see the big picture of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. Most importantly, they have failed to see the role of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in all of it. By stepping back and looking at the bigger picture

<!-- chunk -->

### (even if that bigger picture is playing out on a microscopic level), we can

<!-- chunk -->

### find new ways to understand what’s happening with metabolism and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health and see new ways to address these problems.

# Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Mental Health

<!-- chunk -->

### But do we have evidence that mitochondria aren’t functioning properly in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with mental disorders?

<!-- chunk -->

### Yes! We now have an abundance of evidence.

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the past several decades, it has become clear that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### play a much larger role in human health than ever imagined. When

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria don’t function properly, the human body doesn’t function

<!-- chunk -->

### properly. Mitochondrial dysfunction is the term most frequently used to

<!-- chunk -->

### describe impairment in mitochondrial function. The diseases and illnesses

<!-- chunk -->

### that have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction are widespread,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the list includes almost all of the psychiatric disorders. It also includes

<!-- chunk -->

### the metabolic and neurological disorders that I have discussed—obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. In

<!-- chunk -->

### reality, it includes even more disorders—many cancers and Parkinson’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease are among them. I won’t be able to go into detail on all these

<!-- chunk -->

### different disorders. However, the framework that I am creating will apply to

<!-- chunk -->

### them as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The specific psychiatric disorders in which mitochondrial dysfunction has

<!-- chunk -->

### been identified include the following: schizophrenia, schizoaffective

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, autism, anxiety disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention

<!-- chunk -->

### deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anorexia nervosa, alcohol use disorder (aka

<!-- chunk -->

### alcoholism), marijuana use disorder, opioid use disorder, and borderline

<!-- chunk -->

### personality disorder. Dementia and delirium, often thought of as

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological illnesses, are also included.

<!-- chunk -->

### This list does not include every psychiatric diagnosis in DSM-5.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, that’s not necessarily because mitochondrial dysfunction does not

<!-- chunk -->

### exist in the other diagnoses; research just hasn’t been done on the other

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses yet. Nonetheless, this list is certainly broad enough to state that

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction has been found in a wide range of diagnoses that

<!-- chunk -->

### include pretty much every symptom found in psychiatry.

<!-- chunk -->

### If all this evidence has existed for a while, why hasn’t anyone else

<!-- chunk -->

### suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction is the common pathway to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic or mental disorders?

<!-- chunk -->

### Well . . . they have! To most people reading this book, this may seem

<!-- chunk -->

### like new information. However, this book is not the first to assert the

<!-- chunk -->

### importance of mitochondria in human health and disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Raymond Pearl published a book on the rate of living theory in

<!-- chunk -->

### 1928, in which he argued that longevity and diseases of aging, which

<!-- chunk -->

### include most of the metabolic diseases, are due to metabolic rate. In 1954,

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Denham Harman proposed the free radical theory of aging, which

<!-- chunk -->

### focused on ROS as the cause of age-related diseases. In 1972, he further

<!-- chunk -->

### developed this theory and proposed the mitochondrial theory of aging,

<!-- chunk -->

### which recognized the central role of mitochondria in the production of

<!-- chunk -->

### ROS. In recent years, there has been an explosion of research on

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and their relationship to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, and aging itself, with tens of thousands of research articles

<!-- chunk -->

### published in the medical literature.

<!-- chunk -->

### The psychiatric literature is filled with articles from respected scientists

<!-- chunk -->

### highlighting the role of mitochondria in mental disorders. A 2021 medical

<!-- chunk -->

### literature search came up with more than four hundred articles relating to

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, more than three thousand relating to

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, more than four thousand relating to Alzheimer’s disease, and

<!-- chunk -->

### more than eleven thousand relating to alcohol use. Some of this pioneering

<!-- chunk -->

### research has been close to home for me, coming from respected and

<!-- chunk -->

### internationally renowned colleagues, such as Professors Bruce Cohen and

<!-- chunk -->

### Dost Öngür at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where I have

<!-- chunk -->

### worked for more than twenty-five years.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2017, Dr. Douglas Wallace, the founder of the field of mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### genetics, published an article in JAMA Psychiatry, one of the leading

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric journals, audaciously claiming (as I do in this book) that all

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric disorders are the result of mitochondrial dysfunction.


<!-- chunk -->

### Being a

<!-- chunk -->

### geneticist, Wallace focused on mitochondrial genes. They mutate often due

<!-- chunk -->

### to ROS and the lack of protection of mitochondrial DNA. Wallace argued

<!-- chunk -->

### that the brain is the organ that will be most affected by a problem with

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production by mitochondria. He argued that different parts of the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain might fail first—likely because they are more sensitive to energy

<!-- chunk -->

### deprivation than others. This makes sense, given that most machines do

<!-- chunk -->

### have “weakest links.” The brain is likely the same. So, a small amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### energy deprivation might result in ADHD or depression and a larger

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of energy deprivation might result in other disorders, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia.

<!-- chunk -->

### The rebuttal was swift. Dr. Tamas Kozicz and colleagues argued that

<!-- chunk -->

### although people like “simple” explanations, psychiatric disorders do not

<!-- chunk -->

### lend themselves to such a simple explanation.


<!-- chunk -->

### They acknowledged that

<!-- chunk -->

### “suboptimal mitochondrial function” does appear to play a role in most

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric disorders. However, focusing solely on mitochondrial energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production cannot account for the diversity of symptoms that we see in the

<!-- chunk -->

### billions of people with mental disorders. Furthermore, it can’t even account

<!-- chunk -->

### for the diversity of symptoms that we see in people with rare genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial diseases. Even people with the same mitochondrial genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### mutation can have different symptoms. They argued that mental disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### are far too complex and different from person to person to be explained by a

<!-- chunk -->

### single factor.

<!-- chunk -->

### What these researchers failed to consider is how many other roles

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria play in cells apart from the production of energy. They also

<!-- chunk -->

### failed

<!-- chunk -->

### to recognize just how many different factors affect the function and health

<!-- chunk -->

### of mitochondria. When mitochondria don’t function properly, neither does

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain. When brain metabolism is not properly controlled, the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t work properly. Symptoms can be highly variable, but mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction is both necessary and sufficient to explain all the symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness.

# Defining This Root Cause

<!-- chunk -->

### As I just discussed in the previous chapter, mitochondria do a lot of

<!-- chunk -->

### different things. Defining what dysfunction means is difficult and has been

<!-- chunk -->

### a challenge to scientists; it can mean very different things in different

<!-- chunk -->

### research studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same can be said for cars. If a car is “dysfunctional,” what does that

<!-- chunk -->

### mean? It could mean that the engine sputters when traveling down the

<!-- chunk -->

### highway. It could mean that a tire is flat, and the car can’t move along the

<!-- chunk -->

### road as easily. It could mean that the lights and the turn signals aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### working. Those are all different problems with a car. They all result from

<!-- chunk -->

### different causes. But here’s an important point: Regardless of what is wrong

<!-- chunk -->

### with the car, if it’s on the highway with any of those problems, it will affect

<!-- chunk -->

### the other cars on the road. It will be more likely to slow down traffic or

<!-- chunk -->

### cause an accident. Traffic can slow or completely stop. The highway could

<!-- chunk -->

### “stop working” due to one car. In reality, the overwhelming majority of car

<!-- chunk -->

### accidents aren’t about the cars themselves but about the drivers of the cars.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drivers can also be “dysfunctional.” They can be on their cell phones. They

<!-- chunk -->

### can fall asleep at the wheel. They can be drunk. They can be high. They can

<!-- chunk -->

### have road rage. Regardless of the cause of the dysfunction, whether it’s the

<!-- chunk -->

### car or the driver, these wayward cars and drivers affect traffic in similar

<!-- chunk -->

### ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction is the same. It can be caused by many

<!-- chunk -->

### different things and can result in different problems for the mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### and for the cells in which they reside.


<!-- chunk -->

### Measuring the function of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria is difficult. Remember how tiny they are? There are usually

<!-- chunk -->

### hundreds and sometimes thousands of them in one cell. Cells are pretty tiny

<!-- chunk -->

### on their own.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction can stem from problems with the mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves. This includes genetic mutations or a shortage of mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### in the cell. As I mentioned, mitochondria have their own DNA. It is not

<!-- chunk -->

### protected in the same way that the human genome is protected; therefore,

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s prone to mutations. Mitochondria are producing ROS, and if they

<!-- chunk -->

### produce too much of it, it can damage the mitochondrial DNA or other

<!-- chunk -->

### parts. This can lead to defective mitochondria. When mitochondria are

<!-- chunk -->

### defective, they are supposed to be disposed of and recycled, with new ones

<!-- chunk -->

### taking their place. If this doesn’t happen, a cell can be left with a workforce

<!-- chunk -->

### shortage. It’s well established that the number of mitochondria in our cells

<!-- chunk -->

### decreases as we get older, resulting in less metabolic capacity for cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the workforce is decreased, whether through aging or

<!-- chunk -->

### malfunctioning mitochondria, productivity goes down. As the mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### continue to decline, the cell usually dies. This leads to organs and tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### shrinking. As the cells die off, the organs get weaker and more vulnerable

<!-- chunk -->

### to stress. Brains shrink. People lose muscle mass. The heart isn’t as strong.

<!-- chunk -->

### This phenomenon is also seen in people with chronic mental disorders. As I

<!-- chunk -->

### already mentioned, accelerated aging has been found in people with all

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### The more important cause of mitochondrial impairment is one that I’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### call mitochondrial dysregulation. Many of the factors that affect

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function come from outside the cell. They include

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, hormones, peptides, inflammatory signals, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### something like alcohol. Yep! Alcohol affects the function of mitochondria. I

<!-- chunk -->

### refer to this as dysregulation, as opposed to dysfunction, because in some

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, the mitochondria were functioning just fine, but their environment

<!-- chunk -->

### became hostile quickly and caused impairment—similar to people doing the

<!-- chunk -->

### best they can when they are highly stressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Defining which mitochondrial functions to focus on is critically

<!-- chunk -->

### important and varies in different studies. Some of these studies are done

<!-- chunk -->

### while mitochondria are still in living cells (in vivo), and others are done

<!-- chunk -->

### with mitochondria laid bare in a laboratory dish (in vitro).


<!-- chunk -->

### Many researchers have focused on ATP production. They can measure the

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of ATP relative to ADP in the cell cytoplasm and make assumptions

<!-- chunk -->

### about how well the mitochondria are functioning. The implications of this

<!-- chunk -->

### research are straightforward; ATP provides energy for the cell to work. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the levels are reduced, the cell won’t work as well. The levels of ATP to

<!-- chunk -->

### ADP are also important signals within cells. This ratio affects numerous

<!-- chunk -->

### aspects of cell function, including gene expression. Reduced levels of ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### have been found in a wide variety of disorders, including schizophrenia,

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder, major depression, alcoholism, PTSD, autism, OCD,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity. Even though most people think of obesity as a surplus of energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### many cells in the bodies and brains of people with obesity are actually

<!-- chunk -->

### deprived of ATP, due to mitochondrial dysfunction.


<!-- chunk -->

### Other researchers have focused on oxidative stress. Remember, this is a

<!-- chunk -->

### term used to describe the buildup of ROS. Recall that mitochondria create

<!-- chunk -->

### ROS, but they also help detoxify them through antioxidants. When

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria aren’t working properly, ROS build up and can cause damage

<!-- chunk -->

### to the cell in general, but more often to the mitochondria themselves,

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to a vicious feedback cycle. Numerous studies have found higher

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of oxidative stress in essentially all of the metabolic, neurological,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental disorders that I have been discussing. This has been linked to

<!-- chunk -->

### cell damage and accelerated aging.

<!-- chunk -->

### There have been three major shortfalls in the research on the role of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in health and disease to date:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Focus on just one function. Most studies have focused on only one

<!-- chunk -->

### function or aspect of mitochondria. They often fail to consider all the

<!-- chunk -->

### diverse functions. Some mitochondrial functions can be normal,

<!-- chunk -->

### while others are abnormal. Additionally, some functions can affect

<!-- chunk -->

### other functions. For example, studies that have looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial ATP production often view this as the primary, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes only, role of mitochondria. Any adverse outcomes that

<!-- chunk -->

### they see in the cells they are studying are attributed to this

<!-- chunk -->

### impaired ATP production. In reality, mitochondria that aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### producing enough ATP may also have trouble fusing with each other,

<!-- chunk -->

### or might be leaking large amounts of ROS, or might have trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### managing calcium levels in the cell. These functions may be more

<!-- chunk -->

### important to the cell deficits observed by the researchers, even if

<!-- chunk -->

### those functions weren’t measured. In some cases, ATP production

<!-- chunk -->

### might be normal, while these other functions are abnormal, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers might conclude that the mitochondria were functioning

<!-- chunk -->

### just fine when, in fact, they weren’t.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Differences between cells. Mitochondria are affected by numerous

<!-- chunk -->

### factors, both within the cell and from outside the cell. The number

<!-- chunk -->

### and health of mitochondria are not equally distributed among all cells

<!-- chunk -->

### in the body and brain. Some cells can have perfectly healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in abundance, while other cells can have defective or

<!-- chunk -->

### insufficient mitochondria. Researchers must study specific cells to

<!-- chunk -->

### determine whether mitochondria in those cells are playing a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### an illness. Studying a healthy immune cell may not offer any

<!-- chunk -->

### information about what’s happening in a malfunctioning brain cell.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.The role of feedback loops. The question of which comes first, the

<!-- chunk -->

### chicken or the egg, has led many researchers astray. Does

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction cause illness? Or does illness cause

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction? Are mitochondria simply innocent

<!-- chunk -->

### bystanders and the victims of some other destructive process?

<!-- chunk -->

### When thinking about causes and consequences, things can get

<!-- chunk -->

### confusing. There are many causes of mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are also many consequences. I’ll get to this soon enough.

<!-- chunk -->

### What’s confusing, though, is that causes can lead to consequences,

<!-- chunk -->

### but consequences can lead to causes. When we see this type of a

<!-- chunk -->

### pattern, we need to think about feedback loops. When it comes to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria, almost all things are regulated in a

<!-- chunk -->

### feedback loop.

<!-- chunk -->

### One example is in Alzheimer’s disease research. We know that

<!-- chunk -->

### the abnormal protein beta-amyloid accumulates in the brains of

<!-- chunk -->

### people with Alzheimer’s disease. This protein has been the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### target of research. We know the more beta-amyloid that is present,

<!-- chunk -->

### the more likely it is that someone will develop Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### We also know it is toxic to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many researchers have stopped there. They feel they

<!-- chunk -->

### have enough evidence that mitochondria are innocent bystanders of

<!-- chunk -->

### this destructive protein. What causes beta-amyloid to accumulate?

<!-- chunk -->

### They don’t know. They are still looking for that cause. What they

<!-- chunk -->

### have missed, however, is that mitochondrial dysfunction might very

<!-- chunk -->

### well be the cause of the accumulation of beta-amyloid itself. We

<!-- chunk -->

### have evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction begins even before

<!-- chunk -->

### beta-amyloid starts accumulating.


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s possible that it’s a positive

<!-- chunk -->

### feedback loop. Mitochondrial dysfunction causes a maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### problem in cells. This results in the accumulation of beta-amyloid (a

<!-- chunk -->

### protein that should be getting disposed of and recycled). This beta-

<!-- chunk -->

### amyloid accumulation then makes mitochondrial dysfunction even

<!-- chunk -->

### worse. This feedback loop results in the downward spiral that we

<!-- chunk -->

### call Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fortunately, research in the last twenty years has broadened

<!-- chunk -->

### substantially regarding the scope of mitochondrial function—all the

<!-- chunk -->

### different roles mentioned in the prior Chapter are from different studies

<!-- chunk -->

### looking at the diverse functions that mitochondria perform.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction or dysregulation ties everything that we

<!-- chunk -->

### already know about mental and metabolic disorders together in a coherent

<!-- chunk -->

### way. Mitochondria are the common pathway. For the scientists or purists, a

<!-- chunk -->

### better name for this theory might be the metabolic and mitochondrial theory

<!-- chunk -->

### of mental illness, as this would include the myriad tasks of mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### and how mitochondria can be influenced by all things that affect

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. (I’ll get to these in Part Three of the book.) However, because

<!-- chunk -->

### energy dysregulation does appear to account for the majority of symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### of mental illness, the short and catchy phrase “brain energy theory” works

<!-- chunk -->

### for me.

# How Mitochondrial Malfunction Leads to Mental

# Illness

<!-- chunk -->

### I will now show you how mitochondrial dysfunction can result in all the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain changes and symptoms that we see in mental disorders. Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### affect the development of the brain, the expression of different genes,

<!-- chunk -->

### synapse formation and destruction, and brain activity. They affect structural

<!-- chunk -->

### problems and functional problems. They tie together so much of what we

<!-- chunk -->

### already know and put it into one common pathway. Let’s walk through

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the science.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall that in order to understand much of the existing neuroscience on

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, I need to explain why some brain areas might be

<!-- chunk -->

### overactive, while others might be underactive, resulting in symptoms. I’m

<!-- chunk -->

### also looking for reasons why cells might develop abnormally and why some

<!-- chunk -->

### cells end up shrinking and dying, resulting in brain functions that are

<!-- chunk -->

### permanently absent. These concrete mechanisms of action will help us

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the symptoms of mental illness. They align with the framework

<!-- chunk -->

### that I outlined in Chapter Six.

<!-- chunk -->

### You might also recall from Chapter Five that I said that human illnesses

<!-- chunk -->

### are usually due to a problem in one of three areas: the development,

<!-- chunk -->

### function, or maintenance of cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### As it turns out, mitochondria play a role in all of these.

<!-- chunk -->

### I will now walk you through five broad consequences of mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction and dysregulation that can address all of this: decreased cell

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance, overactive brain functions, underactive brain functions,

<!-- chunk -->

### developmental problems, and cell shrinkage and cell death.

<!-- chunk -->

## Decreased Cell Maintenance

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the unique things about living cells, as opposed to non-living

<!-- chunk -->

### machines like cars, is that they require energy and metabolic resources to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain themselves. Cell parts need to be repaired and replaced in

<!-- chunk -->

### constant, never-ending turnover. All of this requires energy and metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### building blocks. One study estimates about one-third of the brain’s ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### production goes to cell maintenance or “housekeeping” functions.


<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### already described the roles of stress, cortisol, and mitochondria themselves

<!-- chunk -->

### in the process of autophagy, which is critically important in cell

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance. But, as usual, there’s more to the story.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria interact with other organelles to facilitate routine

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance functions. For example, they interact with lysosomes. When

<!-- chunk -->

### these interactions are prevented in experiments, waste products accumulate

<!-- chunk -->

### in the lysosomes.


<!-- chunk -->

### They also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),

<!-- chunk -->

### which has many roles including the folding of proteins. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### neurodegenerative disorders are associated with misfolded proteins in the

<!-- chunk -->

### ER. When these misfolded proteins accumulate, a process called the

<!-- chunk -->

### unfolded protein response (UPR) tries to mitigate the damage. One group of

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers found that there is a microprotein on the outer membrane of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, PIGBOS, that plays a key role in the UPR. When this protein

<!-- chunk -->

### was eliminated, the cells were much more likely to die.


<!-- chunk -->

### This strongly

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that mitochondria play a key role in this process as well. These are

<!-- chunk -->

### just some of the ways that mitochondrial dysfunction can cause problems

<!-- chunk -->

### with cell maintenance, which can lead to all of the maintenance problems

<!-- chunk -->

### and structural defects found in people with mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In some cases, structural defects in cells can lead to a positive feedback

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle that affects metabolism and can make it harder for cells to work. One

<!-- chunk -->

### specific example is myelin, which is an outer protective coating for neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### made by support cells called oligodendrocytes. Myelin makes it easier for

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons to send electrical signals. If a neuron has defects in its myelin

<!-- chunk -->

### coating, it will require more energy to work. An extreme example of this is

<!-- chunk -->

### multiple sclerosis, in which myelin is destroyed by an autoimmune process.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with problems in myelin

<!-- chunk -->

### production and maintenance. Consistent with the brain energy theory,

<!-- chunk -->

### defects in myelin have been identified in the brains of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, epilepsy,

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, and even obesity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Debris in the cell, another structural defect and maintenance issue, can

<!-- chunk -->

### impair mitochondria from moving around. For example, Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease is associated with the accumulation of a protein called tau, in

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to the beta-amyloid described earlier. Researchers who looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### the effects of tau protein on mitochondria found that it severely limited

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria’s ability to move around a cell.


<!-- chunk -->

### Their paths became

<!-- chunk -->

### obstructed from all the debris, and the tau proteins interfered with the

<!-- chunk -->

### cytoskeleton that mitochondria use for movement. When mitochondria are

<!-- chunk -->

### prevented from moving around a cell, the cell has trouble working properly,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the cell may shrink and/or die.

<!-- chunk -->

## Overactive Brain Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember our discussion of overactivity or hyperexcitability from Chapter

<!-- chunk -->

### Six? Mitochondrial dysfunction or dysregulation can cause this! Again, this

<!-- chunk -->

### is probably the most paradoxical thing about mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes when mitochondria aren’t working properly, parts of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### can actually become overactive as opposed to underactive—even though

<!-- chunk -->

### they may not have enough ATP.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the real world, hyperexcitability of cells is actually pretty common.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many medical conditions that are reflections of hyperexcitable

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. Seizures are a clear and extreme example in the brain. A heart

<!-- chunk -->

### arrhythmia can be due to hyperexcitable heart cells. A muscle spasm is a

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitable muscle cell. Chronic pain is due to a hyperexcitable nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### cell. These are all examples of cells firing when they shouldn’t, or not

<!-- chunk -->

### stopping when they should.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to overactivity and

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitability. There are at least three ways this can happen:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Recall that mitochondria are involved in ion pumping and calcium

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation, which are both required to turn cells “off.” If

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria aren’t functioning properly, these processes will take

<!-- chunk -->

### longer to perform, and cells can become hyperexcitable.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Sometimes, overactivity or hyperexcitability can be due to

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction in cells that are meant to slow down other cells, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA cells. If GABA cells aren’t working properly, then the cells

<!-- chunk -->

### they are

<!-- chunk -->

### supposed to inhibit will become unleashed and hyperexcitable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall from Chapter Six that cortical interneurons are one such

<!-- chunk -->

### example, and their dysfunction has been found in many mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.I discussed how maintenance problems can alter the structure of

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, such as problems with myelin or beta-amyloid. These

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance problems can cause hyperexcitability; for example, a

<!-- chunk -->

### lack of myelin can allow ions to leak into a cell and cause it to fire

<!-- chunk -->

### when it shouldn’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### One research group directly demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction

<!-- chunk -->

### causes hyperexcitability by deleting a protein in mice, sirtuin 3, known to

<!-- chunk -->

### be essential to mitochondrial health. Sure enough, the mice developed

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction, hyperexcitability, and seizures, and they died

<!-- chunk -->

### early deaths.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another research group turned stem cells from people with

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder and healthy controls into neurons and found that the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons from the people with bipolar disorder had mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### abnormalities and the cells were hyperexcitable.


<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, lithium

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced this hyperexcitability.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hyperexcitability of neurons has been found in many mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders. It causes seizures and can be measured in the brains of

<!-- chunk -->

### people with epilepsy. Hyperexcitability has also been found in the brains of

<!-- chunk -->

### people with delirium, PTSD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. It has even been

<!-- chunk -->

### measured in healthy rodents subjected to nothing more than chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### stress.


<!-- chunk -->

### Hyperexcitability can be difficult to measure, but we really don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### need to measure it. People can usually tell when it’s occurring because

<!-- chunk -->

### something is happening in their bodies or brains that shouldn’t be

<!-- chunk -->

### happening. Hyperexcitability of a pain cell causes pain. Hyperexcitability of

<!-- chunk -->

### the anxiety pathways in the brain causes anxiety. Hyperexcitability of any

<!-- chunk -->

### brain region that produces a human emotion, perception, cognition, or

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior will produce that experience.

<!-- chunk -->

## Underactive Brain Functions

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction or dysregulation can slow down or reduce the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of cells. Cells require energy to work. Mitochondria provide it.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are also the on/off switch for cells. They control calcium levels and

<!-- chunk -->

### other signals. Brain cells need energy to make and release neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### and hormones and to function properly. Reduced cell function alone

<!-- chunk -->

### explains many of the altered levels of neurotransmitters and hormones seen

<!-- chunk -->

### in people with mental disorders. Additionally, mitochondria are directly

<!-- chunk -->

### involved in making some of the hormones, such as cortisol, estrogen, and

<!-- chunk -->

### testosterone, so if they are dysfunctional or dysregulated, these hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### levels may be dysregulated, too.

<!-- chunk -->

## Developmental Problems

<!-- chunk -->

### Beginning in the womb until early adulthood, the human brain is rapidly

<!-- chunk -->

### growing and forming connections between neurons and other brain cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### These connections are vitally important, laying the groundwork, or

<!-- chunk -->

### “hardwiring,” for life. There are developmental windows—times when the

<!-- chunk -->

### hardwiring of the brain needs to take place in clear ways. If development

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t occur normally, this window can close, and the brain will never

<!-- chunk -->

### again have the chance to be “normal.” Mitochondria are critically important

<!-- chunk -->

### for all these tasks. As I discussed, they play critical roles in cell growth,

<!-- chunk -->

### differentiation, and synapse formation. When mitochondria are

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunctional or dysregulated, the brain doesn’t develop normally. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### important to keep in mind for neurodevelopmental disorders that begin in

<!-- chunk -->

### infancy or childhood, such as autism. Even at the end of life, our brains

<!-- chunk -->

### change in predictable ways. Cell growth and differentiation, as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity, or the changing and adaptability of neurons, are important

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout life. When mitochondria aren’t functioning properly, problems

<!-- chunk -->

### with all of this can occur. If cells or connections between cells are missing,

<!-- chunk -->

### this can result in permanently absent brain functions. These symptoms don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### wax and wane, because the cells and connections needed to perform these

<!-- chunk -->

### functions simply aren’t present.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cell Shrinkage and Cell Death

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to cell shrinkage, or atrophy. If the

<!-- chunk -->

### quantity or health of mitochondria declines, the cell gets stressed. Recall

<!-- chunk -->

### that mitochondria spread themselves throughout the cell. Some are always

<!-- chunk -->

### moving around, looking for work to do. If the workforce is reduced, they

<!-- chunk -->

### can’t keep the entire cell working. In some cases, mitochondria stop going

<!-- chunk -->

### to peripheral parts of the cell, such as axon terminals or dendrites. When

<!-- chunk -->

### they stop going there, those cell parts die. Inflammation ensues. Microglia,

<!-- chunk -->

### the immune cells of the brain, get to work and absorb some of these dead

<!-- chunk -->

### cell parts.


<!-- chunk -->

### As more and more mitochondria become impaired, more and

<!-- chunk -->

### more of the cell shrinks. If the process continues, the cell dies.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is well documented that the brains of people with chronic mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders show signs of cell shrinkage over time. Recall that they are aging

<!-- chunk -->

### prematurely. Different brain regions are affected in different people. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### areas, such as the hippocampus, are more commonly impacted, but even in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with the same diagnosis, such as schizophrenia, there can be

<!-- chunk -->

### numerous differences in the brain regions impacted.


<!-- chunk -->

### This comes back to

<!-- chunk -->

### heterogeneity. Mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation explain this

<!-- chunk -->

### heterogeneity. Given that numerous factors affect mitochondrial function

<!-- chunk -->

### (which I’ll get to just up ahead, in Part Three), they also affect different

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of the brain. So, depending upon the mix of risk factors or causes that

<!-- chunk -->

### people have, their brains will be affected differently. As I already

<!-- chunk -->

### mentioned, timing and development also matter. People who are affected at

<!-- chunk -->

### age fourteen will have brain differences from people not affected until

<!-- chunk -->

### thirty-nine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s put this all together using our car analogy. A car has many parts—a

<!-- chunk -->

### fuel tank, fuel that goes into the tank (gasoline), an engine, a battery for

<!-- chunk -->

### electrical energy, a steering system, and a braking system for stopping.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems can occur in different parts, and different symptoms can result. In

<!-- chunk -->

### some cases, the car may sputter or move slower (underactive function) if it

<!-- chunk -->

### gets water in the gas tank or if a spark plug has gone bad. If the battery

<!-- chunk -->

### begins to fail, it might be that the lights dim, or the windshield wipers slow

<!-- chunk -->

### down, or the radio doesn’t work, or the car won’t start at all (all underactive

<!-- chunk -->

### functions). These are very different symptoms, but they’re all related to

<!-- chunk -->

### energy—and usually with just one cause. Now let’s make the car like a

<!-- chunk -->

### living cell. Suddenly it requires energy to work and energy to maintain

<!-- chunk -->

### itself. Without enough energy, the tires start to deflate, the wheels get

<!-- chunk -->

### wobbly, the doors develop rust and holes (maintenance problems). The

<!-- chunk -->

### engine and battery get old. Battery acid starts to leak all over the engine

<!-- chunk -->

### (ROS). The oil hasn’t been changed in a while, and engine parts are getting

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged. This lack of maintenance makes the engine even worse (a

<!-- chunk -->

### positive feedback cycle). At some point, this car will become a danger to

<!-- chunk -->

### the other cars and the flow of traffic on the highway. The brakes stop

<!-- chunk -->

### working (hyperexcitability due to impaired off switch). Eventually, it may

<!-- chunk -->

### cause a car crash and shut down the highway. The car can be towed to the

<!-- chunk -->

### junkyard for recycling (apoptosis). If someone attempts to drive it again, it

<!-- chunk -->

### will continue to pose a danger to the other cars on the highway and the flow

<!-- chunk -->

### of traffic (metabolic and mental disorders).

# Brain Energy Theory Realized

<!-- chunk -->

### Now let’s see the brain energy theory in action. I’ll walk you through some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the evidence focusing on three different mental disorders and how we

<!-- chunk -->

### can conceptualize what’s happening to produce symptoms from a

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial and metabolic point of view.

<!-- chunk -->

## Major Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### We know from many studies that mitochondria are not functioning properly

<!-- chunk -->

### in people with chronic depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### For example, several lines of evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### have found that people with depression have lower levels of ATP, not only

<!-- chunk -->

### in brain cells, but also in muscle cells and circulating immune cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Decreased ATP production has been found in animal models of depression

<!-- chunk -->

### as well. Autopsy studies looking at brain tissue of people with chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### depression have found specific abnormalities in mitochondrial proteins,

<!-- chunk -->

### clearly implicating mitochondrial dysfunction.


<!-- chunk -->

### And as I already

<!-- chunk -->

### mentioned, levels of oxidative stress are elevated in people with depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another line of evidence includes blood biomarkers of depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many researchers have taken blood samples from thousands of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression looking for abnormalities or differences compared to healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### controls. Numerous biomarkers have been identified. A meta-analysis of

<!-- chunk -->

### forty-six such studies tried to make sense of the differences to see if there

<!-- chunk -->

### might be a common pathway or theme. There was! The biomarkers related

<!-- chunk -->

### primarily to amino acid and lipid metabolism, both of which relate to

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function.


<!-- chunk -->

### One specific biomarker of great interest is acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC).

<!-- chunk -->

### This molecule is produced within mitochondria and is important to energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production. It is critical for the function of the hippocampus, a brain region

<!-- chunk -->

### often implicated in depression. One group of researchers looked at levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### ALC in depressed and non-depressed people and found that the depressed

<!-- chunk -->

### people, on average, had lower levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, lower levels of ALC

<!-- chunk -->

### predicted the severity of depression, the chronicity of the illness, treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance, and even a history of emotional neglect. A subsequent study in

<!-- chunk -->

### 460 patients with depression found that ALC levels improved with effective

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant treatments, and that these levels could help predict who

<!-- chunk -->

### would experience a full remission.


<!-- chunk -->

### These researchers concluded, “New

<!-- chunk -->

### strategies targeting mitochondria should be explored to improve treatments

<!-- chunk -->

### of Major Depressive Disorder.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Perhaps the most direct and stunning evidence for the role of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in depression comes from an elegant study done in rats.


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers identified rats that had high levels of anxiety and depression-

<!-- chunk -->

### like behaviors and then studied a specific part of their brains, the nucleus

<!-- chunk -->

### accumbens, to see if there were differences in mitochondrial function and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### how the cells developed. They found both. The anxious/depressed rats had

<!-- chunk -->

### fewer mitochondria per cell, as well as differences in the way their

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria used oxygen to turn energy into ATP and in how

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria interacted with another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum

<!-- chunk -->

### (ER). The neurons themselves also looked different. Following the trail

<!-- chunk -->

### further, the researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### found that the mitochondria from these rats had lower levels of mitofusin-2

<!-- chunk -->

### (MFN2), a protein on mitochondrial membranes important to their ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### fuse with each other and with the ER. Here’s the stunning part. They then

<!-- chunk -->

### injected the anxious/depressed rats with a viral vector that significantly

<!-- chunk -->

### increased the levels of MFN2. And that changed everything! The

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria began functioning normally, the neurons began to look

<!-- chunk -->

### normal, and the anxiety and depression-like behaviors stopped. This

<!-- chunk -->

### strongly suggests a causal role for mitochondria in depression and anxiety .

<!-- chunk -->

### . . at least in rats.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the symptoms of depression fall neatly into the category of

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive functions or reduced metabolism. Changes in sleep, energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation, and concentration likely all relate to reduced function of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. The fatigue almost certainly extends to the muscles throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, given that mitochondrial dysfunction has been found there, too. In

<!-- chunk -->

### some cases, people will describe “leaden paralysis,” a situation in which

<!-- chunk -->

### they feel like their arms and legs are made of lead and it’s difficult to even

<!-- chunk -->

### move them. Mitochondrial dysfunction in their muscles might explain this.

<!-- chunk -->

### If their muscles don’t have enough energy, people will have difficulty

<!-- chunk -->

### moving them. Catatonia is an extreme version of metabolic failure—people

<!-- chunk -->

### can appear paralyzed from their illness and have severe difficulty moving or

<!-- chunk -->

### speaking.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bipolar Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### Direct evidence for metabolic abnormalities in bipolar disorder (and

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia) dates to 1956 when researchers noted abnormalities in

<!-- chunk -->

### lactate metabolism in patients.


<!-- chunk -->

### There are many studies documenting

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder, with findings similar to those

<!-- chunk -->

### found in people with depression. However, one important question is: What

<!-- chunk -->

### makes depression different than mania? Anyone who has seen people with

<!-- chunk -->

### these two conditions knows there is a big difference.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 2018, researchers published a review article, “A Model of the

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial Basis of Bipolar Disorder,” in which they proposed that

<!-- chunk -->

### depressive states appear to be energy-deficient states, while manic states

<!-- chunk -->

### appear to involve increased energy production in the brain.


<!-- chunk -->

### They cited

<!-- chunk -->

### several

<!-- chunk -->

### studies showing that manic states are associated with increased glucose and

<!-- chunk -->

### lactate utilization in the brain, both suggestive of increased mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production. Additionally, two neurotransmitters, glutamate and

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, have been found to be elevated in manic states, suggesting

<!-- chunk -->

### increased activity of these neurons. So, manic states appear to be one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### few unique situations in which mitochondria, at least in some brain cells,

<!-- chunk -->

### are producing more energy than normal. Although surprising, this is still

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction or dysregulation. The mitochondria are supposed

<!-- chunk -->

### to slow down at appropriate times, such as at night to allow for sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### Different brain cells are supposed to stop at certain times—like the traffic in

<!-- chunk -->

### a major city. In manic states, the mitochondria are hyperactive in terms of

<!-- chunk -->

### their production of energy, and this is making cells “go” when they

<!-- chunk -->

### shouldn’t. They aren’t yielding or slowing down at appropriate times. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the brain appear to be overactive.

<!-- chunk -->

### Several additional lines of evidence support this model.


<!-- chunk -->

### Bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### patients have been found to have higher than normal calcium levels,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially when they are manic—consistent with the hyperexcitability

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism that I outlined. In fact, researchers have confirmed changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### neuronal excitability in bipolar patients. For anyone who has seen people

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression or mania, this makes perfect sense. People with mania

<!-- chunk -->

### clearly have too much energy. People with depression clearly don’t have

<!-- chunk -->

### enough energy. It’s fascinating that this has been found at the cellular level.

<!-- chunk -->

### In people with bipolar disorder, once the manic episode resolves, they

<!-- chunk -->

### continue to have mitochondrial dysfunction, but it results in too little energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production overall. One group of researchers recently identified a

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial biomarker in blood cells showing a significant decrease in

<!-- chunk -->

### the number of mitochondria in both manic and depressed states that

<!-- chunk -->

### normalized when people were feeling well.


<!-- chunk -->

### This suggests that something

<!-- chunk -->

### might be disrupting either mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the entire body during disease states, not just in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### During manic episodes, one of the biggest dangers with too much

<!-- chunk -->

### energy is its effect on hyperexcitable cells. These are the cells that have

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged mitochondria, too few mitochondria, or structural damage due to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance problems. The short burst of energy during a manic phase isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### enough to correct the longstanding problems associated with mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. It’s not enough energy or time to repair the cells. Instead, it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### enough to cause major problems, like psychotic symptoms, anxiety, and

<!-- chunk -->

### agitation. An easy way to think about this is to go back to our car analogy.

<!-- chunk -->

### If a car is in poor shape with deflated and misaligned tires due to poor

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance, giving that car more gas suddenly is actually a dangerous

<!-- chunk -->

### thing. It’s not ready to handle more energy or more speed. It will be more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to crash and burn. That’s what happens when you give a

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitable cell too much energy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### PTSD can be understood as a hyperexcitable trauma response system. This

<!-- chunk -->

### system is a normal response to life-threatening events but is now turning on

<!-- chunk -->

### when it shouldn’t or failing to turn off when it should. For some people, this

<!-- chunk -->

### system appears to develop a lower threshold for firing. For example, many

<!-- chunk -->

### people with a trauma history will have clearly identified “triggers” that set

<!-- chunk -->

### off their symptoms. These can be places, people, smells, words, or even

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two areas of the brain are commonly affected, the amygdala and the

<!-- chunk -->

### medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The amygdala sets off the fear response

<!-- chunk -->

### and has been found to be hyperexcitable in PTSD. The mPFC is an area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain that inhibits the amygdala. By doing so, it can stop a panic

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction once someone realizes that there’s no need to panic. This area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain has been found to be underactive in people with PTSD, meaning

<!-- chunk -->

### that the person will have trouble stopping a panic reaction. Several lines of

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence have demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in people with

<!-- chunk -->

### PTSD, including autopsy studies showing abnormalities in mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### gene expression, reductions in total mitochondria, increased levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress, and reduced levels of ATP.


# A Unifying Example

<!-- chunk -->

### But can all mental disorders really be due to metabolism and mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction?

<!-- chunk -->

### Some people may still have a difficult time with this new way of

<!-- chunk -->

### conceptualizing mental disorders, as lumping all the disorders together

<!-- chunk -->

### under the pathway of metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction may seem

<!-- chunk -->

### like a stretch.

<!-- chunk -->

### To help address this concern, we should be able to look at situations in

<!-- chunk -->

### which we know mitochondrial function is impaired abruptly and see

<!-- chunk -->

### essentially all psychiatric symptoms emerge. As it turns out, we have a clear

<!-- chunk -->

### example for this test proof—delirium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Delirium is a serious condition defined as an acute mental disturbance.

<!-- chunk -->

### The word “acute” means that it happens rapidly. The “mental disturbance”

<!-- chunk -->

### can be any psychiatric symptom—confusion, disorientation, distractibility,

<!-- chunk -->

### fixation on certain topics, hallucinations, delusions, mood changes, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### agitation, withdrawal, dramatic changes in sleep, and personality changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every single symptom of any psychiatric disorder can occur during

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium. Even changes in eating behaviors and perception of body image

<!-- chunk -->

### that mimic an eating disorder have been observed during delirium.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, what causes delirium? The standard answer right now: No one

<!-- chunk -->

### knows for sure how it all works, but we know that when people are

<!-- chunk -->

### seriously ill, it can happen. Almost all medical disorders can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium. This includes things like infections, cancer, autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, heart attacks, and strokes. The more serious they are, the more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely they are to cause delirium. People admitted to intensive care units

<!-- chunk -->

### (ICUs) are much more likely to have delirium, with anywhere from 35 to

<!-- chunk -->

### percent of critically ill patients being diagnosed with it, depending upon the

<!-- chunk -->

### study.


<!-- chunk -->

### Medications can also do it. People starting new medications can have

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions that can cause delirium. Withdrawal from medications or

<!-- chunk -->

### substances, even toxic ones like heavy use of alcohol, can cause delirium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol withdrawal delirium has a special name, delirium tremens. It can

<!-- chunk -->

### be quite serious and life-threatening. The elderly are particularly vulnerable

<!-- chunk -->

### to

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium. People with preexisting dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### are even more vulnerable. Essentially, there are countless causes of

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium. As I will soon explore, they all affect mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### How is delirium diagnosed? When symptoms of delirium begin,

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes the cause is obvious. In some cases, the initial symptoms can be

<!-- chunk -->

### seen as a normal response to a medical condition. Many people who have

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attacks will have anxiety. It’s difficult to imagine not being anxious

<!-- chunk -->

### when facing a life-threatening situation. Physicians will often give people

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric medications, such as benzodiazepines, to reduce their anxiety. In

<!-- chunk -->

### this early phase, they usually don’t diagnose delirium or a psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, even though they are prescribing a psychiatric medication. The

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety is often seen as a normal, understandable reaction. However, if

<!-- chunk -->

### these anxiety symptoms are the start of delirium, the symptoms usually

<!-- chunk -->

### become more dramatic. People can develop panic attacks and severe

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety. This can quickly progress to confusion, disorientation, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations. This is common in frail, elderly people with heart attacks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although these symptoms can be identical to those of dementia or

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, physicians don’t assign these diagnoses. Instead, they

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnose delirium.

<!-- chunk -->

### But how do they think about this distinction? Most healthcare

<!-- chunk -->

### professionals know that the brain simply isn’t working right under the stress

<!-- chunk -->

### of a heart attack. They will attribute any and all new psychiatric symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### to the heart attack. Anything goes. Obsessions. Compulsions. Confusion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression. Agitation. Delusions. Anything! Healthcare professionals will

<!-- chunk -->

### lump all symptoms under the diagnosis of delirium. People with delirium

<!-- chunk -->

### won’t have all the symptoms of every mental disorder. They may have just

<!-- chunk -->

### a few. Some will develop symptoms of OCD. Others will look more

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed and withdrawn. Others will look manic and agitated. This doesn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### matter, either. Any combination of symptoms is irrelevant. They are all due

<!-- chunk -->

### to delirium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Delirium can sometimes occur more gradually. One of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### common causes of delirium in the elderly is a urinary tract infection, or

<!-- chunk -->

### UTI. This can be more difficult to recognize and diagnose. Oftentimes,

<!-- chunk -->

### these people don’t know they have a UTI. The brain shows the first signs of

<!-- chunk -->

### a problem, not the bladder. Elderly people who were otherwise fine a few

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks prior

<!-- chunk -->

### can begin to develop confusion and memory problems. Family members or

<!-- chunk -->

### healthcare professionals often become concerned about Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. The symptoms look exactly the same. These people can get

<!-- chunk -->

### confused often. They might get lost driving. They can have trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### remembering the names of people who they see every day. Once taken to a

<!-- chunk -->

### healthcare professional, a medical workup might then reveal the problem—

<!-- chunk -->

### a UTI. Treating the UTI can resolve all symptoms. Although it was due to

<!-- chunk -->

### an infection in the bladder, the symptoms came from the brain. Why?

<!-- chunk -->

### Because the brain is the most sensitive organ to energy deprivation, or

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction. It is the weakest link. It almost always shows at

<!-- chunk -->

### least some subtle signs first.

<!-- chunk -->

### How do these different medical conditions lead to the development of

<!-- chunk -->

### essentially every psychiatric symptom? Experts speculate about

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, stress responses, and inflammation.


<!-- chunk -->

### All of these are

<!-- chunk -->

### true. But how, exactly, do they fit together and lead to psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms? At this point, the medical community doesn’t have a coherent

<!-- chunk -->

### theory, but the brain energy theory offers one.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am not the first to suggest that delirium is due to metabolic problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1959, George Engel, the developer of the biopsychosocial model,

<!-- chunk -->

### proposed that delirium is due to disturbed brain energy metabolism, or

<!-- chunk -->

### “cerebral metabolic insufficiency.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Many researchers have expanded on

<!-- chunk -->

### this hypothesis since then.


<!-- chunk -->

### For example, PET imaging studies have

<!-- chunk -->

### revealed decreased brain glucose metabolism in people with delirium.


<!-- chunk -->

### Many serious medical conditions are known to directly impact metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondrial function. However, given that the medical community

<!-- chunk -->

### hasn’t been able to explain mental symptoms, it has not been clear if or how

<!-- chunk -->

### these metabolic and mitochondrial abnormalities might play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### causing the mental symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### How is delirium treated? The treatment depends upon the underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### cause or causes, and the specific symptoms. Once the medical condition

<!-- chunk -->

### that is causing delirium is identified, the standard treatments for that

<!-- chunk -->

### condition are implemented. This can be an antibiotic for the UTI or

<!-- chunk -->

### standard cardiology protocols for the heart attack. What about the mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms? Even though the symptoms fall under the label of delirium, we

<!-- chunk -->

### use

<!-- chunk -->

### just about anything and everything in psychiatry to control the symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sedating medications are commonly used—antipsychotics, mood

<!-- chunk -->

### stabilizers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. If the symptoms of delirium are extreme depression and a lack

<!-- chunk -->

### of energy, sometimes stimulants are used. We use medications to help with

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms, but really, we wait for the underlying medical condition to

<!-- chunk -->

### be fully treated. The symptoms of delirium usually go away once the

<!-- chunk -->

### medical condition resolves. It’s a temporary case of mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Does delirium really matter? Once the primary medical condition is

<!-- chunk -->

### identified, such as the heart attack, does it really matter if the person has

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms or not? Many people think it doesn’t. They don’t take the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms very seriously. They see them as annoying problems that

<!-- chunk -->

### just make delivering good care more difficult. For example, some

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiologists will ignore mental symptoms in the context of a heart attack.

<!-- chunk -->

### To them, the problem is plain and clear—it’s a heart attack. Whether the

<!-- chunk -->

### person is anxious or not doesn’t really matter. Even if a person is

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinating, they might think that doesn’t matter either. That is a problem

<!-- chunk -->

### for a consulting psychiatrist to deal with. It doesn’t pertain to the heart or

<!-- chunk -->

### the cardiologist’s job. Unfortunately, this all-too-common perspective is

<!-- chunk -->

### shortsighted. It ignores a tremendous amount of research showing that

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium does matter. Sometimes, it’s the difference between life and death.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the brain energy theory is correct, people with delirium should have

<!-- chunk -->

### more widespread or severe mitochondrial dysfunction than people without

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium. The “mental” symptoms are giving us a warning sign. If this is

<!-- chunk -->

### true, more widespread and severe mitochondrial dysfunction should mean a

<!-- chunk -->

### whole host of things. It should mean that people with delirium will be more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to develop a mental disorder, dementia, or a seizure. It should also

<!-- chunk -->

### mean they will be more likely to die. Are any of these things true? It turns

<!-- chunk -->

### out they all are.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and PTSD, are

<!-- chunk -->

### common after an episode of delirium. Higher rates of dementia and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive impairment have been consistently documented at three, twelve,

<!-- chunk -->

### and eighteen months after hospital discharge in people with delirium

<!-- chunk -->

### compared

<!-- chunk -->

### to people with the same illnesses who don’t have delirium.


<!-- chunk -->

### In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium in older people results in an eightfold increased risk of subsequent

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia. Hyperexcitable brain cells have also been well documented, with

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures being the most extreme consequence. In one study of people with

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium, 84 percent had abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs), with

<!-- chunk -->

### percent showing clear seizure activity.


<!-- chunk -->

### People with delirium are more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to die early. During a hospital admission, people with delirium are

<!-- chunk -->

### twice as likely to die early as those without delirium.


<!-- chunk -->

### After discharge from

<!-- chunk -->

### the hospital, the one-year mortality rates for people with delirium are 35 to

<!-- chunk -->

### 40 percent, much higher than in those without delirium.


<!-- chunk -->

### How do we make sense of this? Delirium tells us that there is

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain. Sometimes it can be reversible, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the person completely recovers. But not always. What this data suggests is

<!-- chunk -->

### that the mitochondrial dysfunction can persist or progress. Mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### the cells can become damaged—a reduction in the workforce of the cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### This leaves cells more vulnerable to continued dysfunction. Some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### cells themselves can actually die and not get replaced. All of this results in a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in the reserve capacity of different brain regions. Any of these can

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to mental disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, or seizures.

<!-- chunk -->

### What about people who show signs of a more subtle mental disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### say depression, during an ICU stay? If depression is also due to

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction, then we should expect that depression would be

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with higher death rates or seizures. Is this true? Yes, it is. Recall

<!-- chunk -->

### that I discussed the research showing that people who are depressed after a

<!-- chunk -->

### heart attack are twice as likely to have another one over the following year.

<!-- chunk -->

### And elderly people with depression are six times more likely to have

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures. Similar research has been done in patients with a wide variety of

<!-- chunk -->

### medical illnesses. After an ICU stay, patients with depression were

<!-- chunk -->

### percent more likely to die than those without depression in the two years

<!-- chunk -->

### following discharge.


<!-- chunk -->

### This and other research suggests that any mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, even if not formally diagnosed as delirium, are associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### higher rates of premature death. Arguably, mental symptoms are like the

<!-- chunk -->

### canary in the coal mine; they are sometimes the first indication of metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondrial failure.

<!-- chunk -->

### What about people with longstanding mental disorders? If their disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### are truly due to mitochondrial dysfunction, that should leave them more

<!-- chunk -->

### vulnerable to developing delirium if, in fact, delirium is due to

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction. Is this true? Yes, it is. Recall the Danish

<!-- chunk -->

### population study of more than seven million people.


<!-- chunk -->

### That study found that

<!-- chunk -->

### people with mental disorders—all of them—were more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### “organic” mental disorders, which includes the diagnoses of delirium and

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia. All told, depending upon the diagnosis, people were two to

<!-- chunk -->

### twenty times more likely to develop these disorders. Chronic mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses are like a warning light in a car. They give us a window into a

<!-- chunk -->

### person’s metabolic health. They tell us that the brain isn’t working right due

<!-- chunk -->

### to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction. If we ignore it, sometimes it will

<!-- chunk -->

### correct itself. If it continues and we turn a blind eye to it, symptoms and

<!-- chunk -->

### other illnesses will usually follow.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the example of delirium didn’t convince you, maybe this one will—

<!-- chunk -->

### the dying process. In some medical schools, students are taught a mantra of

<!-- chunk -->

### the dying process—“seizures, coma, death.” This is the sequence of events

<!-- chunk -->

### that commonly occur as people are dying. What this leaves out is delirium,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is almost universal. People will commonly hallucinate, become

<!-- chunk -->

### disoriented, have mood symptoms, or develop any of the other mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. Their brains are failing because the mitochondria in their brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells are failing. The dying process is unequivocally associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial failure. This short sequence of events—delirium, seizures,

<!-- chunk -->

### coma, and death—highlights all the consequences of mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction that I have been discussing. It highlights the paradox of both

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced cell function and hyperexcitable cells in the context of rapid

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial failure, culminating in death.

# The Question of Language and Our Path Toward

# Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### The theory of brain energy suggests that all mental disorders have the

<!-- chunk -->

### common pathway of mitochondria. When mitochondria aren’t working

<!-- chunk -->

### right,

<!-- chunk -->

### neither is the brain. If this is true, how much do our diagnostic labels

<!-- chunk -->

### matter? What should we call mental disorders?

<!-- chunk -->

### Our current diagnostic labels will likely persist for some time. Change

<!-- chunk -->

### is difficult and takes time. Furthermore, our current diagnoses do provide

<!-- chunk -->

### some useful information. They describe constellations of symptoms that

<!-- chunk -->

### people exhibit. Symptoms matter. They will require different treatments—at

<!-- chunk -->

### least different symptomatic treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, given the overlap discussed between the diagnoses, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### fact that people with the exact same diagnoses can have different

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, there is clearly room for improvement. Mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction or dysregulation provides an explanation for an unlimited

<!-- chunk -->

### number of symptoms in different people. We’ve seen that depending upon

<!-- chunk -->

### which brain cells and brain networks are involved, and which factors are

<!-- chunk -->

### affecting the function of mitochondria, people will have different

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. This establishes that a change in the way we think about mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders is warranted.

<!-- chunk -->

### One simple model would be to call all mental disorders delirium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maybe we separate transient delirium and chronic delirium. The transient

<!-- chunk -->

### type resolves within two to three months, and the chronic type lasts longer.

<!-- chunk -->

### This label would remind all clinicians that they need to keep looking for the

<!-- chunk -->

### cause or causes of the metabolic brain dysfunction instead of simply

<!-- chunk -->

### administering symptomatic treatments. This would largely follow current

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment protocols for delirium already in place, but it would expand these

<!-- chunk -->

### protocols to all who are currently labeled “mentally ill.”

<!-- chunk -->

### As some will resist the use of “delirium” for all mental disorders, we

<!-- chunk -->

### could, alternatively, call all mental disorders “metabolic brain dysfunction”

<!-- chunk -->

### and add specifiers for the different symptoms that people are experiencing.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, someone with prominent anxiety symptoms might receive the

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis of “metabolic brain dysfunction with anxiety symptoms.” A

<!-- chunk -->

### person with schizophrenia might receive the diagnosis of “metabolic brain

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction with psychotic, depressive, and cognitive symptoms.” In all

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, the primary diagnosis would remain the same, “metabolic brain

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction,” but the symptoms would change as treatments work or as the

<!-- chunk -->

### illness progresses or remits. Instead of having multiple diagnoses, as is

<!-- chunk -->

### commonly the case now, people would have one disorder, metabolic brain

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction, with the different symptoms of this disorder.

# The Brain Energy Theory . . . in a Nutshell

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s a quick recap of the brain energy theory:

<!-- chunk -->

### Mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain. Although most

<!-- chunk -->

### people think of metabolism as burning calories, it’s much more than that.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metabolism affects the structure and function of all cells in the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Regulators of metabolism include many things, such as epigenetics,

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, neurotransmitters, and inflammation. Mitochondria are the

<!-- chunk -->

### master regulators of metabolism, and they play a role in controlling the

<!-- chunk -->

### factors just listed. When mitochondria aren’t working properly, at least

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the cells in your body or brain won’t function properly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Symptoms of mental illness can be understood as overactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive, or absent brain functions. Mitochondrial dysfunction or

<!-- chunk -->

### dysregulation can cause all of these through five distinct mechanisms: (1)

<!-- chunk -->

### cell activity can be overactive; (2) cell activity can be underactive; (3) some

<!-- chunk -->

### cells can develop abnormally (leading to absent brain functions); (4) cells

<!-- chunk -->

### can shrink and die (also leading to absent brain functions); and (5) cells can

<!-- chunk -->

### have problems maintaining themselves (which can contribute to

<!-- chunk -->

### overactivity, underactivity, or absent brain functions). For example, if the

<!-- chunk -->

### cells that control anxiety are overactive, you will have anxiety symptoms. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the cells that control memory are underactive, you will have memory

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment. If metabolic problems occur at a young age, the brain can

<!-- chunk -->

### develop abnormally, which can occur in autism. If metabolic problems

<!-- chunk -->

### occur over long periods of time, cells can shrink and die, which is found in

<!-- chunk -->

### most chronic mental disorders and Alzheimer’s disease. And finally,

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance problems can

<!-- chunk -->

### leave cells in a state of disrepair and can contribute to any of these other

<!-- chunk -->

### problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, you’re likely wondering what causes metabolic and mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction or dysregulation. The answer is . . . lots of things. The good

<!-- chunk -->

### news is that many of them are probably already familiar to you. They will

<!-- chunk -->

### be the focus of the next and final section of the book. The exciting news is

<!-- chunk -->

### that most of them can be identified and addressed.

# Part III

# Causes and Solutions


# What’s Causing the Problem and

# What Can We Do?

<!-- chunk -->

### t’s time to fully revisit the known risk factors and theories for what

<!-- chunk -->

### causes mental illness through the new lens of brain energy, or

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria. If all mental disorders are metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders and if mitochondria are really the common pathway, then all

<!-- chunk -->

### known risk factors for mental illness must tie directly to metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, fitting together somehow. We must see evidence of cause and

<!-- chunk -->

### effect. Most of what I’m about to run through are well-established and

<!-- chunk -->

### irrefutable risk factors. Until now, though, no one has been able to connect

<!-- chunk -->

### them. In the following chapters, I will connect each one of them to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria, proving the link that has long been missing

<!-- chunk -->

### in the mental health field.

<!-- chunk -->

### The term risk factor is appropriate when cause-and-effect relationships

<!-- chunk -->

### are unknown. The brain energy theory changes this. Therefore, I will start

<!-- chunk -->

### using the term contributing causes instead of risk factors. For most people,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are several contributing causes that come together to result in illness;

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s not usually just one single root cause.

<!-- chunk -->

### A quick note on terminology: In this section, I’ll sometimes refer to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and other times talk about mitochondria. They are closely

<!-- chunk -->

### related, but they are not the same thing. Going back to our traffic analogy, it

<!-- chunk -->

### might help to think of the difference this way: Metabolism is the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### traffic, and mitochondria are the drivers and workers inside the cars. As

<!-- chunk -->

### discussed earlier, while the drivers are primarily responsible for the flow of

<!-- chunk -->

### traffic, they aren’t the only factor. Traffic is also affected by environment,

<!-- chunk -->

### weather, and unforeseen obstacles, including things like daylight or

<!-- chunk -->

### nighttime driving; rain, snow, or hailstorms; road construction; and other

<!-- chunk -->

### factors that are beyond the control of the drivers but require drivers to

<!-- chunk -->

### respond as well. So, mitochondria are always involved in metabolism, but

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problems or challenges are not always due to mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### “dysfunction.” Sometimes the mitochondria are doing what they are

<!-- chunk -->

### supposed to be doing under the circumstances, but the environment poses

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic challenges. To give an easy example, a woman could be

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically healthy, but if she takes a hallucinogen, she might begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinate right away. The drug dysregulates her metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, causing symptoms, but it’s unfair to mitochondria to say they

<!-- chunk -->

### are “dysfunctional.” They are simply doing their best under the

<!-- chunk -->

### circumstances, just like drivers in cars might be doing their best in a

<!-- chunk -->

### hailstorm.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the contributing causes I will discuss simply slow down

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and their function. Some of them, however, are outright

<!-- chunk -->

### assaults. Some can destroy the mitochondria in cells. Some can impair their

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to produce energy. Some can impair their ability to perform other

<!-- chunk -->

### functions, such as fusing with each other or sending signals to the DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### While some of these causes may be minor and go unnoticed initially,

<!-- chunk -->

### together with the occurrence of additional assaults they can result in enough

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial impairment to produce mental symptoms. Others can be

<!-- chunk -->

### decisive and catastrophic assaults on mitochondria that result in severe

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms immediately—such as mitochondrial poisons. These

<!-- chunk -->

### serious assaults often affect more than just the brain (all the cells in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body can be affected, for instance), and life-threatening situations can

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes result.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the contributing causes stimulate mitochondria and increase

<!-- chunk -->

### their production of energy, at least in the short run. This can sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### be beneficial. It can improve symptoms of reduced cell function, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### fatigue. At other times, however, it can result in problems of too much

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. This can be as simple as the inability to sleep at night after drinking

<!-- chunk -->

### coffee. Caffeine stimulates mitochondria. But remember hyperexcitable

<!-- chunk -->

### cells? If they get too much energy, it can mean trouble—anxiety, psychosis,

<!-- chunk -->

### or seizures. As different as these symptoms are, you’ll be surprised to see

<!-- chunk -->

### that sometimes one factor can trigger all of them. Prescription stimulants,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as Ritalin or Adderall, stimulate mitochondria. They can provide

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriate symptom relief in some people. However, they can also cause

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, psychosis, or seizures in other people.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three important themes to note when reviewing the different

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing causes:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.All directly impact metabolism and mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.All are associated with a wide variety of symptoms of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Not one of them is specific to any one disorder or

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom. This is consistent with the observation that all mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders have one common pathway: mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.All are also associated with metabolic and neurological disorders—

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and

<!-- chunk -->

### epilepsy. They are also associated with many other medical

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses, but I will focus on these five. The factors that I will be

<!-- chunk -->

### discussing can trigger exacerbations of these “physical” disorders as

<!-- chunk -->

### well. This supports the observation that mental disorders share a

<!-- chunk -->

### common pathway with these medical and neurological disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am not going to present an exhaustive scientific review of each factor.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is a tremendous amount of science to support each one. My goal here

<!-- chunk -->

### is to provide a broad overview for how all these contributing causes relate

<!-- chunk -->

### to metabolism, mitochondria, and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### I will begin with the biological factors and end with psychological and

<!-- chunk -->

### social factors. This is not to imply that biological factors are more

<!-- chunk -->

### important.

<!-- chunk -->

### In many cases, they aren’t. However, reviewing the biological factors first

<!-- chunk -->

### will set the stage for how psychological and social ones affect metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria.

# Why Different People Have Different Symptoms and

# Disorders—And Why Connections Persist Across

# Them

<!-- chunk -->

### I began to address this issue in Part Two, but it’s worth revisiting two

<!-- chunk -->

### questions as we move into looking at specific contributing causes and

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments. First:

<!-- chunk -->

### If all mental disorders are due to mitochondrial dysfunction or

<!-- chunk -->

### dysregulation, why is there so much variability in symptoms? How do

<!-- chunk -->

### malfunctioning mitochondria and metabolic toll cause one person to end up

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression, and another with OCD, for instance?

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two primary answers:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Differences in preexisting vulnerabilities. All people are different.

<!-- chunk -->

### This includes identical twins. Even when the genetic code is the same

<!-- chunk -->

### for two people, they are still different. At the end of the day, we are

<!-- chunk -->

### all products of our biological blueprints (genetics) and our past

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences and environmental exposures. Nature and nurture.

<!-- chunk -->

### Experiences and exposures include the psychological and social

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences we’ve had, but they also include metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental exposures. These begin at conception. Our bodies are

<!-- chunk -->

### constantly responding to the environment and its access to nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### and oxygen, hormones, temperature, light, and so many other factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### These all affect our metabolism and mitochondria, but specific

<!-- chunk -->

### factors affect some cells and not others. Over time, we develop parts

<!-- chunk -->

### of our brains and bodies that are strong and resilient, but also ones

<!-- chunk -->

### that are weaker and more vulnerable to failure. Metabolic failure of

<!-- chunk -->

### specific cells or brain networks is what causes mental symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

### so these areas of vulnerability influence which symptoms develop

<!-- chunk -->

### first. In essence, our metabolism is only as strong as its weakest link.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of it like the muscles of your body. Some of your muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### are stronger than others. If you have to lift something very heavy—a

<!-- chunk -->

### major stressor—the weakest muscles will likely fail first. This can

<!-- chunk -->

### be different in different people. If three people lift the same heavy

<!-- chunk -->

### object, one might sprain a wrist, another might pull a muscle in his

<!-- chunk -->

### leg, and a third might throw out her back. Same stressor—different

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms—that will require different treatments due to different

<!-- chunk -->

### vulnerabilities.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Differences in inputs. Cells and the mitochondria within them are

<!-- chunk -->

### affected by many inputs, ones that impact different parts of the body

<!-- chunk -->

### and brain at different times. In the following chapters, I will discuss

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing causes that affect mitochondria in one way or another.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of these are well-known risk factors for mental illness. Some of

<!-- chunk -->

### them will impact all the cells in the body and brain. However, most

<!-- chunk -->

### won’t. Many of these factors affect only some cells but not others.

<!-- chunk -->

### When faced with different situations or tasks, different body parts or

<!-- chunk -->

### brain regions need different amounts of energy. If energy were

<!-- chunk -->

### equally distributed throughout the body and brain, not only would it

<!-- chunk -->

### be a waste of energy for the cells that don’t need it, but it would

<!-- chunk -->

### divert precious energy from the cells that do need it. This means that

<!-- chunk -->

### some of these contributing causes will impact some brain regions but

<!-- chunk -->

### not others. This can lead to different symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The answers here lead directly to a second question:

<!-- chunk -->

### If there are clear differences in individual vulnerabilities and other

<!-- chunk -->

### factors that lead to differences in dysfunction, how are all mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders related? Why should having metabolic problems in one

<!-- chunk -->

### type of cell have anything to do with the function of other types of cells?

<!-- chunk -->

### To answer this, let’s go back to our analogy of metabolism: traffic in a

<!-- chunk -->

### city. There are many factors that determine whether city traffic flows

<!-- chunk -->

### smoothly or not. The same is true with metabolism. And at the same time,

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s all interconnected.

<!-- chunk -->

### A traffic problem can start in one small section of the city—a single car

<!-- chunk -->

### accident blocking a busy street. Likewise, a metabolic problem can start in

<!-- chunk -->

### one group of cells that cause symptoms related to what those cells do. The

<!-- chunk -->

### problem can start off contained to only those cells due to preexisting

<!-- chunk -->

### vulnerabilities and/or different inputs as I just outlined.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the problems persist, however, the symptoms can spread. When it

<!-- chunk -->

### comes to city traffic, if the car accident isn’t quickly removed, the traffic

<!-- chunk -->

### jam will become more widespread, affecting traffic in other parts of the city.

<!-- chunk -->

### If traffic problems are caused by poor road maintenance, then it can result

<!-- chunk -->

### in long-term problems. Metabolism is the same. A problem in one area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body will often spread over time. Why? Because metabolism is highly

<!-- chunk -->

### interconnected. It relies on feedback loops all over the body. So, if one area

<!-- chunk -->

### is not doing well, the rest of the body can be affected. If the problem isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### corrected, it will gradually take a toll and spread—sometimes over years or

<!-- chunk -->

### decades.

# Treatments and Success Stories

<!-- chunk -->

### For each of the contributing causes of mental illness, I will outline some

<!-- chunk -->

### strategies that can be used to address problems when possible. Some of

<!-- chunk -->

### them are standard, existing treatments. (Again, a new theory doesn’t replace

<!-- chunk -->

### what we already know to work.) Some of them will be new treatments that

<!-- chunk -->

### you likely haven’t considered before. As a rule of thumb, they fall into the

<!-- chunk -->

### following broad categories:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Treatments that remove or reduce things that are dysregulating

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria or metabolism, such as poor diet, sleep disturbances,

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol or drug use, some medications, or psychological/social

<!-- chunk -->

### stressors.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatments that correct for metabolic imbalances, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter or hormonal imbalances.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.Treatments that improve metabolism. I break these strategies into

<!-- chunk -->

### three categories:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mitochondrial biogenesis—There are ways to increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### number of mitochondria in your cells. Increasing the workforce

<!-- chunk -->

### improves metabolic capacity.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mitophagy—Getting rid of old, defective mitochondria and

<!-- chunk -->

### replacing them with new, healthy ones can also play a role.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rejuvenating the workforce improves metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Autophagy—Repairing structural damage that has occurred to

<!-- chunk -->

### your cells because of longstanding metabolic problems can be

<!-- chunk -->

### essential to long-term healing.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Chapter Twenty, I’ll give you an overarching approach and basic

<!-- chunk -->

### strategies to use in developing a comprehensive treatment plan. Please hold

<!-- chunk -->

### off on implementing any of the treatments that I discuss until you get to the

<!-- chunk -->

### very end of the book. You’ll need to understand all the different

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing causes and treatment approaches before deciding which ones

<!-- chunk -->

### will be appropriate for you.

<!-- chunk -->

### Along the way, I will also share stories of real people who have

<!-- chunk -->

### improved their mental health using metabolic interventions. Their names

<!-- chunk -->

### have been changed to protect their privacy, but their stories are true.

# Genetics and Epigenetics

<!-- chunk -->

### ental disorders run in families. This has been known for centuries

<!-- chunk -->

### and established now as fact based on tremendous amounts of

<!-- chunk -->

### research. This observation has led many people to conclude that the

<!-- chunk -->

### root cause of mental illness, at least for some people, must lie in their genes.

<!-- chunk -->

### When an illness runs in families, it’s largely assumed to be genetic, because

<!-- chunk -->

### genes are the way that information gets transmitted from parents to

<!-- chunk -->

### children. We now know that it’s not so simple.

# Genetics

<!-- chunk -->

### From 1990 to 2003, an international community of researchers began one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the largest scientific undertakings of our time: the Human Genome Project

<!-- chunk -->

### (HGP). Researchers began to sequence and map all the human genes—three

<!-- chunk -->

### billion letters, or base pairs, of DNA. The whole world was

<!-- chunk -->

### excited and full of hope about the potential for ending all kinds of illness,

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly those thought or known to be inherited. In psychiatry, we

<!-- chunk -->

### imagined that with a complete genetic blueprint, we could identify the

<!-- chunk -->

### genes responsible for each psychiatric disorder, find out what protein

<!-- chunk -->

### they’re coding for, develop medications to address the problems, and

<!-- chunk -->

### possibly even find cures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since the HGP was completed, researchers have discovered about 1,800

<!-- chunk -->

### genes responsible for various diseases and developed about two thousand

<!-- chunk -->

### genetic tests that can measure an individual’s genetic risk for certain

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases. Some patients can be tested to see if they will metabolize

<!-- chunk -->

### medications too slowly or fast. The effort has paid off in many ways. But

<!-- chunk -->

### sadly, not in psychiatry.

<!-- chunk -->

### The search for the genes that cause mental illnesses has largely come up

<!-- chunk -->

### empty-handed. It’s not for a lack of trying. Researchers have scoured the

<!-- chunk -->

### human genome, looking at the genes for neurotransmitters, the enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### that make them, and their receptors. These were the obvious targets—the

<!-- chunk -->

### chemicals in the chemical imbalance theory—serotonin, dopamine, and

<!-- chunk -->

### others. Unfortunately, no meaningful relationships have been found

<!-- chunk -->

### between these genes and mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Next, researchers decided to scan the entire genome for genes that

<!-- chunk -->

### might be related to mental illness via genome-wide association studies

<!-- chunk -->

### (GWAS). They kept an open mind and looked at every gene, even ones

<!-- chunk -->

### seemingly unrelated to the brain or psychiatry, in order to find the genes

<!-- chunk -->

### that cause mental illness. After these exhaustive searches, researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### identified a plethora of genes that might be related to psychiatric disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### but they found almost no genes that confer significant risk to a significant

<!-- chunk -->

### portion of the people with the disorders. Some very rare genes were

<!-- chunk -->

### identified that can confer high levels of risk, but for most people with

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, specific genes don’t confer large amounts of risk. On top

<!-- chunk -->

### of that, the vast majority of genes that have been found are not specific to

<!-- chunk -->

### individual disorders. Instead, they confer risk for many different

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric, metabolic, and neurological disorders. For example, some risk

<!-- chunk -->

### genes for psychosis confer risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### developmental delay, intellectual

<!-- chunk -->

### disability, and epilepsy.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, one gene confers risk for many disorders. For

<!-- chunk -->

### major depression, there is debate in the field, with some studies suggesting

<!-- chunk -->

### that there are genes that confer tiny amounts of risk (I’ll tell you about a

<!-- chunk -->

### couple of them soon), but other studies suggest that not even one gene has

<!-- chunk -->

### been found that confers significant risk, despite looking at more than 1.2

<!-- chunk -->

### million genetic variations in human DNA.


<!-- chunk -->

### The disappointment of not finding genetic answers to these inheritable

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders isn’t limited to psychiatry. It also applies to the metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These, too, run in

<!-- chunk -->

### families—often the same families that have mental illness. These

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions, too, have eluded easy answers in human DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even though thousands of genes confer tiny amounts of risk, how can

<!-- chunk -->

### we understand this in the context of the brain energy theory? If

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and metabolism account for all mental disorders, what do

<!-- chunk -->

### genes have to do with mental illness at all?

<!-- chunk -->

### To begin with, many of these risk genes are directly related to

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and metabolism. For example, a gene called DISC1 confers

<!-- chunk -->

### risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and autism. Researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### continue to look at all the roles this protein plays in cell function, but it has

<!-- chunk -->

### been found within mitochondria and is known to influence mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### movement, fusion, and contact with other parts of the cell. This, in turn,

<!-- chunk -->

### affects neuron development and plasticity.


<!-- chunk -->

### One of the strongest risk genes

<!-- chunk -->

### for mood disorders, CACNA1C, plays a major role in oxidative stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial integrity and function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another example is the APOE gene, which increases the risk for

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. This gene codes for a protein, Apolipoprotein E, that

<!-- chunk -->

### is related to fat and cholesterol transportation and metabolism. The gene

<!-- chunk -->

### comes in three forms: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. About 25 percent of

<!-- chunk -->

### people carry one copy of APOE4, and 2 to 3 percent have two copies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those with one copy are three to four times more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s, and those with two copies are about nine to fifteen times more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely.


<!-- chunk -->

### In support of the brain energy theory, this gene strongly impacts

<!-- chunk -->

### both metabolism and mitochondria. People in their twenties who have the

<!-- chunk -->

### APOE4 gene

<!-- chunk -->

### are more likely to already show signs of impaired glucose metabolism in

<!-- chunk -->

### their brains, and this impairment worsens over time.


<!-- chunk -->

### Apolipoprotein E appears to have direct effects on mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers looked at people who had different APOE types and measured

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins that impact mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics (their fusion and

<!-- chunk -->

### fission with each other), and oxidative stress.


<!-- chunk -->

### Those with the APOE4 allele

<!-- chunk -->

### had lower levels of these important mitochondrial proteins, and the levels

<!-- chunk -->

### correlated directly with symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Another study looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### astrocytes, important support cells in the brain, and found that APOE4

<!-- chunk -->

### impairs autophagy, mitochondrial function, and mitophagy.


<!-- chunk -->

### The good news

<!-- chunk -->

### is that they found that giving a drug that stimulates autophagy could reverse

<!-- chunk -->

### some of these abnormalities.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, does APOE4 increase risk for all of the metabolic and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders? It does increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, some other

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders, and epilepsy, but paradoxically, it appears to decrease the

<!-- chunk -->

### risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is where the complexity of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism comes in. Apolipoprotein E is not found equally in all cells in

<!-- chunk -->

### the human body. In the brain, it’s found primarily in astrocytes and

<!-- chunk -->

### microglia. These cells have specific functions. It appears that APOE4

<!-- chunk -->

### results in a very slow and gradual decline in their function, and these cells

<!-- chunk -->

### are more closely related to cognitive symptoms than other symptoms. So,

<!-- chunk -->

### these “parts” of the brain are the ones that will wear down and begin to fail

<!-- chunk -->

### over time, resulting in specific symptoms. However, once they begin to fail

<!-- chunk -->

### completely, then the other mental symptoms of Alzheimer’s begin due to

<!-- chunk -->

### the interconnections of these brain regions. So, as I discussed, this is an

<!-- chunk -->

### example of a preexisting vulnerability (a risk gene) and different inputs to

<!-- chunk -->

### different cells, both playing a role in causing some symptoms and not

<!-- chunk -->

### others. Nonetheless, this line of research still directly implicates metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria as the common pathway to Alzheimer’s.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondrial genetics are also complicated because mitochondria are

<!-- chunk -->

### influenced by genes in both the nucleus and within mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves. The genes within mitochondria are much more susceptible to

<!-- chunk -->

### mutations. Genetic mutations in mitochondria have been directly linked to

<!-- chunk -->

### numerous aspects of brain function, including behavior, cognition, food

<!-- chunk -->

### intake, and the stress response.


<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, mitochondrial genes have

<!-- chunk -->

### not been widely looked at in large population studies because most

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers have assumed that mitochondrial genes don’t matter all that

<!-- chunk -->

### much.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even for genes related to other proteins supporting other functions in

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, they, too, will have an impact on metabolism. Genes are the blueprints

<!-- chunk -->

### for different proteins that make up the human body. Just like different parts

<!-- chunk -->

### of a car, and all the variations of these parts in different makes and models

<!-- chunk -->

### of cars, some are more reliable and fuel efficient than others. Some are

<!-- chunk -->

### adapted for adversity and have shorter lives while others are adapted for

<!-- chunk -->

### fuel efficiency and longevity. Depending upon which ones you inherit, they

<!-- chunk -->

### can influence the function of your cells, your metabolism, and your overall

<!-- chunk -->

### health. They can also confer different degrees of susceptibility to metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### failure. When it comes to metabolism, there is always a “weakest link.”

<!-- chunk -->

### When the parts of a cell are different, some are going to be more vulnerable

<!-- chunk -->

### to failure than others.

<!-- chunk -->

### With this said and done, it is all but certain that for the majority of

<!-- chunk -->

### people with mental illness, the answer to their problem does not lie in the

<!-- chunk -->

### genes themselves. If genes don’t fully explain why mental disorders run in

<!-- chunk -->

### families, then what could it be?

# Epigenetics

<!-- chunk -->

### Epigenetics, which we covered briefly in Part Two, is the field dedicated to

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding what causes genes to turn on or off. Most of us have similar

<!-- chunk -->

### genes. We have essentially the same blueprints for how the body should

<!-- chunk -->

### work. Yes, there are obvious variations, such as height, skin color, and hair

<!-- chunk -->

### color. These are due to differences in our genes. But most of our genes are

<!-- chunk -->

### basically the same. The human body works in the same way in most people.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, what is clearly different is the expression of all these genes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Skin cells, brain cells, and liver cells all have the same DNA. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### epigenetics is responsible for making the different cells in the human body

<!-- chunk -->

### different from each other. These different cells express different genes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout the day, genes are getting turned on or off in cells. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### constantly changing based on environmental circumstances and the needs of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. In other words, the body is constantly adapting. Sometimes it

<!-- chunk -->

### needs to make a hormone, so those genes get turned on. Sometimes it needs

<!-- chunk -->

### to repair a cell, so those genes get turned on. Once done, these genes get

<!-- chunk -->

### turned off. Cells don’t waste resources.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are changes in gene expression that appear to be longer lasting

<!-- chunk -->

### than these constantly fluctuating ones. Some changes in gene expression are

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with traits in people. Some people have big muscles, others are

<!-- chunk -->

### skinny, while others are obese. Gene expression is different in these people

<!-- chunk -->

### over longer periods of time, even though they all have similar underlying

<!-- chunk -->

### genes. There are specific patterns of gene expression that have been

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with different traits, both physical and mental. These

<!-- chunk -->

### longstanding epigenetic changes are a way for the body to come up with a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic strategy and then stick with it. Epigenetics provides a memory of

<!-- chunk -->

### what the body has been through.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many ways that the body controls gene expression. One way

<!-- chunk -->

### is to modify the DNA itself by applying methyl groups to specific sites on

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA. These methyl groups then influence which genes get turned on or off.

<!-- chunk -->

### The methyl groups can be added or removed as needed, but at least at some

<!-- chunk -->

### sites, they appear to become more stable over time. Another way the body

<!-- chunk -->

### influences gene expression is through histones. These are proteins that

<!-- chunk -->

### DNA gets wrapped around. They, too, influence which genes get turned on

<!-- chunk -->

### or off. In addition to methylation and histones, there are many other factors

<!-- chunk -->

### that are involved in epigenetics. More and more are being discovered every

<!-- chunk -->

### year. They include factors like micro-RNAs, hormones, neuropeptides, and

<!-- chunk -->

### others. This field quickly becomes confusing and overwhelming, as there

<!-- chunk -->

### are so many factors that are involved in the epigenetic control of our DNA.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if you take a step back and look at the field from a broader

<!-- chunk -->

### perspective, things become less confusing. What influences epigenetics?

<!-- chunk -->

### What triggers all these different factors to change gene expression? Almost

<!-- chunk -->

### all of them revolve around metabolism and mitochondria. Factors thought

<!-- chunk -->

### to influence epigenetics include diet, exercise, drug and alcohol use,

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones, light exposure, and sleep—all related to metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria (as you will soon learn). As a specific example, smokers tend

<!-- chunk -->

### to have less DNA methylation of the AHRR gene compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### nonsmokers.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, if they stop smoking, this change in methylation is

<!-- chunk -->

### reversible.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the end, it’s important to think about epigenetics as metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### blueprints for cells. Epigenetics simply reflect the gene patterns that allow

<!-- chunk -->

### cells to do their best to survive and cope with their environments. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### if they get stuck in a maladaptive pattern or if the appropriate signals aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### being sent, that can become problematic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall that mitochondria are regulators of epigenetics. They influence

<!-- chunk -->

### gene expression through levels of ROS, levels of glucose and amino acids,

<!-- chunk -->

### and levels of ATP. Also recall that mitochondria appear to control the

<!-- chunk -->

### expression of essentially all genes for a cell. I already told you about the

<!-- chunk -->

### study that found that as the number of defective mitochondria in a cell

<!-- chunk -->

### increases, the number of gene expression abnormalities also increases.

<!-- chunk -->

### It turns out that epigenetic factors are heritable. This occurs in different

<!-- chunk -->

### ways. I’ll discuss a few of them.

<!-- chunk -->

## Womb Environment

<!-- chunk -->

### As a fetus is growing inside the womb, it is bathed in metabolic signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Food, oxygen, vitamins, and minerals play an obvious and critical role.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, the mother’s hormones, neuropeptides, use of alcohol, drugs,

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription medications, and so many other factors are also playing roles.

<!-- chunk -->

### One example of epigenetics playing a clear role in the transmission of

<!-- chunk -->

### both metabolic and mental disorders is the famous Dutch winter famine,

<!-- chunk -->

### which took place between 1944 and 1945 due to the German occupation of

<!-- chunk -->

### the Netherlands. Researchers have studied the babies that were conceived or

<!-- chunk -->

### carried during this famine and compared them to the general population and

<!-- chunk -->

### even their own siblings who were born when the mothers had normal access

<!-- chunk -->

### to food. The babies born during the famine were more likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### both metabolic and mental disorders later in life. This and other

<!-- chunk -->

### studies led to the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, which proposes that babies

<!-- chunk -->

### deprived of proper nutrition in utero are more likely to develop obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life. Unfortunately, this

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothesis overlooks or ignores the fact that these babies are also more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to develop mental disorders. These babies were found to have double

<!-- chunk -->

### the risk for schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder, as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### increased rates of depression, bipolar disorder, and addiction.


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### have been studying the pancreas to understand the elevated rates of

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, the heart to understand the elevated rates of cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, and the brain to understand the psychiatric and neurological

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders but have failed to see the metabolic connection among all of them.

<!-- chunk -->

## Early Life

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of the factors that regulate epigenetics, metabolism, and mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### get transferred to the baby after birth through behaviors and early life

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences. Many studies have looked at caregiver behaviors toward

<!-- chunk -->

### infants early in life and their impact on long-term health outcomes. They

<!-- chunk -->

### typically align with the ACEs studies that I already described. Caregiver

<!-- chunk -->

### neglect and deprivation have profound effects on children for life. They

<!-- chunk -->

### include both metabolic and mental disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms play a

<!-- chunk -->

### role in all of this.

<!-- chunk -->

### A concrete example down to the molecular level is the passing of a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic factor from mothers to children in breast milk. One such

<!-- chunk -->

### molecule is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. This is a critically

<!-- chunk -->

### important coenzyme that can be derived from vitamin B3 (niacin), or the

<!-- chunk -->

### body can make it using the amino acid tryptophan from protein. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### essential to mitochondria for energy production but also plays a role in the

<!-- chunk -->

### maintenance of DNA and epigenetics. Low levels of this enzyme are known

<!-- chunk -->

### to impair mitochondrial function and cause epigenetic changes, and have

<!-- chunk -->

### been associated with aging and many diseases.


<!-- chunk -->

### One group of researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at mice and the long-term outcomes of their babies after

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementing new mothers with NAD or not.


<!-- chunk -->

### The mothers who got extra

<!-- chunk -->

### NAD lost more weight postpartum, a nice metabolic benefit. But their

<!-- chunk -->

### babies really benefited from this! The baby mice had improved blood

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose control, physical performance,

<!-- chunk -->

### and many brain changes, including less anxiety, improved memory, reduced

<!-- chunk -->

### signs of “learned helplessness” (a marker of depression), and they even had

<!-- chunk -->

### greater neurogenesis into adulthood. Clearly, this metabolic/mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme given in infancy impacted their brains and “mental” symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### for life. Mothers will naturally have different levels of this coenzyme that

<!-- chunk -->

### they transfer to their babies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma

<!-- chunk -->

### The most widely studied phenomenon of how epigenetics relate to mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health is the intergenerational transmission of trauma. Dr. Rachel Yehuda,

<!-- chunk -->

### a leading authority in this field, outlined decades of research in a

<!-- chunk -->

### comprehensive review article: “Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma

<!-- chunk -->

### Effects: Putative Role of Epigenetic Mechanisms.”


<!-- chunk -->

### This field dates back

<!-- chunk -->

### to 1966, when an astute psychiatrist, Dr. Vivian Rakoff, noticed that

<!-- chunk -->

### children of Holocaust survivors appeared to sometimes have more severe

<!-- chunk -->

### forms of mental illness than their parents, even though it was the parents

<!-- chunk -->

### who spent time in the concentration camps. She asserted that somehow

<!-- chunk -->

### these things were connected. Many at the time didn’t believe this. Those

<!-- chunk -->

### who did assumed that the parents must somehow be teaching their children

<!-- chunk -->

### to be afraid, anxious, or depressed, and this must be the reason for the

<!-- chunk -->

### connection. It must be a psychological or social cause. Numerous studies

<!-- chunk -->

### followed and began to identify a pattern of parental trauma and poor mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health outcomes in their children—and even their grandchildren. But still,

<!-- chunk -->

### almost everyone assumed that this was due to upbringing. The parents must

<!-- chunk -->

### be teaching their children to be stressed and afraid of the world.

<!-- chunk -->

### This assumption was first challenged in the 1980s when researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered differences in how people respond to cortisol. People exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma—and their children—have different levels of sensitivity to

<!-- chunk -->

### glucocorticoids. In particular, exposure to high levels of cortisol in utero

<!-- chunk -->

### appear to “program” children, resulting in higher risk for developing mental

<!-- chunk -->

### and metabolic disorders later in life. With the genetic and epigenetic

<!-- chunk -->

### revolution came the discovery that many of these people have differences in

<!-- chunk -->

### methylation patterns of the glucocorticoid receptor and other DNA regions

<!-- chunk -->

### (promoter

<!-- chunk -->

### regions) associated with the stress response system. Most recently, it has

<!-- chunk -->

### been discovered that even fathers might be passing on their traumatic

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences through epigenetic mechanisms in sperm, such as micro-RNA

<!-- chunk -->

### (miRNA) molecules, which are known to modify gene expression. Studies

<!-- chunk -->

### have now shown that sperm in both mice and men have miRNAs that get

<!-- chunk -->

### transmitted to offspring. Levels of specific miRNAs (449 and 34) have been

<!-- chunk -->

### shown to be directly affected by levels of stress dating all the way back to

<!-- chunk -->

### early childhood experiences of the fathers.


<!-- chunk -->

### In mice who are exposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### early stressful life events, these levels were dramatically reduced in sperm

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, and their male offspring also had these same low levels in their sperm

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, demonstrating transgenerational transmission of stress. In human

<!-- chunk -->

### studies, men were given the ACEs questionnaire, and it turned out that men

<!-- chunk -->

### with the highest levels of stressful life events had the lowest levels of these

<!-- chunk -->

### exact same miRNAs, up to a three-hundredfold reduction.

<!-- chunk -->

### The timing of the stress appears to matter and can influence brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function in different ways.


<!-- chunk -->

### Fetal exposure to a mother’s stress results in

<!-- chunk -->

### higher rates of learning impairment, depression, and anxiety later in life. In

<!-- chunk -->

### the first few years of life, separating a child from his/her mother can result

<!-- chunk -->

### in higher levels of cortisol throughout life, while severe abuse can result in

<!-- chunk -->

### lower levels of cortisol. Although paradoxical, both states take a metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### toll and can be tied directly to mitochondria, given that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### initiate production of cortisol.

<!-- chunk -->

### This line of research continues to this day, but what it clearly

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrates is that epigenetics appears to be playing a significant role in

<!-- chunk -->

### the transmission of mental disorders from parents to children, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### grandchildren.

# What Genetics and Epigenetics Can Tell Us About

# Causes—and Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Although some have been disappointed with our inability to find specific

<!-- chunk -->

### genes related to mental disorders, at the end of the day, I believe it’s a good

<!-- chunk -->

### thing. We now know that there are usually not “abnormal” genes that cause

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness. It’s much more likely that the transmission of mental illness

<!-- chunk -->

### from parents to children takes place through epigenetic mechanisms. The

<!-- chunk -->

### hopeful aspect of this insight is that most of these epigenetic mechanisms

<!-- chunk -->

### are known to be reversible!

<!-- chunk -->

### The effects of in utero stress, micro-RNA levels, and levels of NAD are

<!-- chunk -->

### changeable, sometimes through lifestyle interventions alone. The other

<!-- chunk -->

### hopeful aspect of this is that people are not usually born with “bad genes”

<!-- chunk -->

### that make it impossible for them to be healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall my analogy of the three cars—A, B, and C. They were all the

<!-- chunk -->

### same make and model, and therefore, they all had the same blueprints (or

<!-- chunk -->

### genes). But they were very different from each other. The two primary

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons for the differences in the health, maintenance, and longevity of the

<!-- chunk -->

### cars were (1) the environment and (2) a dysfunctional driver applying

<!-- chunk -->

### adaptive strategies at the wrong times or failing to use adaptive strategies

<!-- chunk -->

### when needed. In human terms, this means that the primary causes of mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness are usually not in our genes, but instead in our environments or the

<!-- chunk -->

### drivers of our cells, mitochondria. So, you’re likely wondering what makes

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria dysfunctional. I’ll get to many of these factors in the

<!-- chunk -->

### remainder of the book.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even for people with the APOE4 gene allele—one that impairs

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function over time—there is hope for healing. Not everyone

<!-- chunk -->

### with this gene develops Alzheimer’s disease. I mentioned the study that

<!-- chunk -->

### found that increasing autophagy can lessen the problem. I will get to more

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments in the following chapters, including some that specifically

<!-- chunk -->

### improve autophagy, but for now, understand that mental illnesses, even ones

<!-- chunk -->

### like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, are likely not due to genetic defects

<!-- chunk -->

### that are permanent and fixed. Metabolic problems are reversible.


# Chemical Imbalances,

# Neurotransmitters, and Medications

<!-- chunk -->

### now come back to the chemical imbalance theory. The theory of brain

<!-- chunk -->

### energy doesn’t challenge the observations that neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances play a role in mental disorders, nor does it challenge the

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical trials that have demonstrated improvement in symptoms using

<!-- chunk -->

### medications that affect neurotransmitters. And I certainly don’t mean to

<!-- chunk -->

### challenge the real-world experience of the many people who have been

<!-- chunk -->

### helped, or even saved, by psychiatric medications. All of these are true and

<!-- chunk -->

### based on an abundance of evidence. However, as I’ve already pointed out,

<!-- chunk -->

### the chemical imbalance theory leaves many questions unanswered and fails

<!-- chunk -->

### to restore lives for far too many people.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain energy theory offers new ways to understand neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances and the effects of medications. Mitochondria and metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### explain the underactivity and overactivity/hyperexcitability of specific brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells that result in these imbalances and the problem of either too much or

<!-- chunk -->

### too little neurotransmitter activity. However, neurotransmitters also go on to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce their own effects in target cells, resulting in stimulation or

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibition of mitochondria in those cells. This quickly becomes like a chain

<!-- chunk -->

### of dominoes, where metabolic disruption in one set of cells results in

<!-- chunk -->

### problems in other cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people talk about neurotransmitters as simple entities with simple

<!-- chunk -->

### functions. Serotonin makes us feel good. Dopamine drives psychosis and

<!-- chunk -->

### addiction. Norepinephrine helps us focus. Although there is some truth to

<!-- chunk -->

### these statements, these simplistic views of neurotransmitters and the

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders associated with them are almost farcical. The brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, and mental disorders are all much more complicated than

<!-- chunk -->

### that.

<!-- chunk -->

### Neurotransmitters are not just simple on/off signals between cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Research in the past decade has greatly expanded our view of their role in

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondrial function. Neurotransmitters and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are in a feedback cycle with each other. Mitochondria affect

<!-- chunk -->

### the balance of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters affect the balance of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria and their function.

<!-- chunk -->

### As mentioned in Chapter Seven, mitochondria play a key role in the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of many neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, glutamate,

<!-- chunk -->

### norepinephrine, dopamine, GABA, and serotonin. Mitochondria also have

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors for some important neurotransmitters directly on their

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes, such as benzodiazepine and GABA receptors. These aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### present on all mitochondria in all cells, but they have been identified in at

<!-- chunk -->

### least some cell types. Mitochondria also have one important enzyme known

<!-- chunk -->

### to most psychiatrists: monoamine oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### degradation and regulation of some very important neurotransmitters, such

<!-- chunk -->

### as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. All these neurotransmitters

<!-- chunk -->

### directly impact the function of mitochondria, and mitochondria directly

<!-- chunk -->

### impact the balance of these neurotransmitters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin, a neurotransmitter best known for its role in depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety disorders, has a very prominent and complex role in metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondrial function.


<!-- chunk -->

### It is a primitive and highly conserved

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter found in all animals, worms, insects, fungi, and plants. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### known to control appetite, digestive tract functions, and metabolism of

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrients broadly. About 90 percent of the serotonin in the human body is

<!-- chunk -->

### actually located in the digestive tract, not the brain. Recent research has

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated a direct role of serotonin in regulating the production and

<!-- chunk -->

### function of mitochondria within cortical neurons, enhancing their

<!-- chunk -->

### production of ATP and decreasing oxidative stress.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, not only does

<!-- chunk -->

### serotonin increase mitochondrial function immediately, it results in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial biogenesis—one of the ways to improve metabolism! In

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to this clear and direct link, there’s even more to the story.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is converted into melatonin, an important hormone in the

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation of sleep, which plays a powerful role in metabolism as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Serotonin is also the product of an important metabolic pathway, the

<!-- chunk -->

### kynurenine pathway, that involves the fate of the amino acid tryptophan.

<!-- chunk -->

### When people eat protein that contains tryptophan, it has many possible

<!-- chunk -->

### fates. Two important ones are getting converted into serotonin or

<!-- chunk -->

### kynurenine. Kynurenine eventually leads to higher levels of the critically

<!-- chunk -->

### important molecule NAD that I already told you about. NAD has a

<!-- chunk -->

### profound influence on the health and function of mitochondria because it is

<!-- chunk -->

### essential to energy production and managing electrons. Problems with the

<!-- chunk -->

### kynurenine metabolic pathway have been found in many psychiatric and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, Tourette’s syndrome, dementia, and others. Obviously,

<!-- chunk -->

### medications that affect serotonin levels will have a direct impact on

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria through all these mechanisms. This fact

<!-- chunk -->

### likely explains why and how these medications work for disorders like

<!-- chunk -->

### depression and anxiety.

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA is also an important neurotransmitter with a wide range of

<!-- chunk -->

### functions. It is best known for its role in anxiety disorders because

<!-- chunk -->

### medications that increase GABA activity, such as Valium, Klonopin, and

<!-- chunk -->

### Xanax, produce a calming, anti-anxiety effect. However, abnormalities of

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmission have also been found in other disorders, including

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia and autism. Mitochondria directly influence and sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### control GABA activity. One group of researchers found that mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### ROS levels regulate the strength of GABA activity.


<!-- chunk -->

### Fascinatingly, another research group demonstrated a more direct link

<!-- chunk -->

### between GABA, mitochondria, and mental symptoms. This study was done

<!-- chunk -->

### in flies and involved a known, but rare, genetic defect associated with both

<!-- chunk -->

### autism and schizophrenia. The researchers showed that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### actually sequester GABA inside themselves, thereby directly controlling its

<!-- chunk -->

### release. When this process was prevented by the genetic defect, social

<!-- chunk -->

### deficits resulted. When the researchers corrected GABA levels or the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of mitochondria, the social deficits were corrected. These

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers directly tied a known, but rare, genetic defect to mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### function, GABA, and social deficit symptoms.


<!-- chunk -->

### GABA doesn’t just affect mental functions, it also plays a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders like obesity. One group of researchers found that

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA plays an important role in brown adipose tissue, a special type of fat

<!-- chunk -->

### that gets turned on when you get cold and also plays an important role in

<!-- chunk -->

### overall body metabolism. Problems with GABA signaling in this type of fat

<!-- chunk -->

### result in mitochondrial calcium overload and metabolic abnormalities often

<!-- chunk -->

### found in people who are obese.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, these few examples illustrate how

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria can control GABA activity, and GABA activity can affect

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function, creating a feedback cycle.

<!-- chunk -->

### One final example is dopamine. Dopamine is released from neurons,

<!-- chunk -->

### binds to receptors, and then is usually taken back up into the releasing

<!-- chunk -->

### neuron for another round. However, some of it ends up inside cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### needs to be managed . . . by, you guessed it, mitochondria. They have the

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme, monoamine oxidase, that degrades it. This process directly

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulates mitochondria to produce more ATP.


<!-- chunk -->

### But there’s more to the

<!-- chunk -->

### story. A recent discovery showed that dopamine is directly involved in the

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation of glucose and metabolism.


<!-- chunk -->

### The dopamine D2 receptor is well

<!-- chunk -->

### known to most psychiatrists because almost all antipsychotic medications

<!-- chunk -->

### affect this specific receptor. We now know that dopamine D2 receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### aren’t located just

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain, they are also found in the pancreas and play a critical role in

<!-- chunk -->

### the release of insulin and glucagon. It has long been known that

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotic medications can affect weight, diabetes, and metabolism. The

<!-- chunk -->

### science is now catching up to explain why. More intriguing, however, is the

<!-- chunk -->

### possibility that these effects on insulin might be playing a direct role in the

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotic effect. It may have nothing to do with dopamine D2 receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### in the brain. I’ll share more about insulin and why this might be possible in

<!-- chunk -->

### the next chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### These few examples illustrate some of the connections between

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, mitochondria, and metabolism.

# Psychiatric Medications, Metabolism, and

# Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### Medications that increase or decrease the levels of serotonin, GABA, or

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine will clearly have an impact on mitochondria and metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### through the mechanisms that I have already outlined. This includes many

<!-- chunk -->

### classes of antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and antipsychotics.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an example, we all know that Valium can reduce anxiety. One study

<!-- chunk -->

### looked directly at the impact of Valium on anxiety and social dominance

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors in rats to determine precisely how it was working.


<!-- chunk -->

### researchers already knew that reduced mitochondrial function in an area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain called the nucleus accumbens (NAc) causes social anxiety

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors, so they wanted to determine if Valium was somehow affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### this area. They found that Valium was working by activating another area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain called the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which sends dopamine to

<!-- chunk -->

### the NAc. This dopamine increases mitochondrial function in the NAc,

<!-- chunk -->

### resulting in higher ATP levels, and this leads to reduced anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### enhanced social dominance. When the researchers blocked the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### dopamine, this therapeutic effect was lost. But here’s the kicker—when they

<!-- chunk -->

### blocked mitochondrial respiration in the NAc, the therapeutic effects were

<!-- chunk -->

### also lost, even though those cells were still getting the enhanced dopamine.

<!-- chunk -->

### These

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers concluded that their findings “highlight mitochondrial function

<!-- chunk -->

### as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety-related social dysfunctions.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Different medications affect mitochondria in vastly different ways. One

<!-- chunk -->

### review article, “Effect of Neuropsychiatric Medications on Mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### Function: For Better or For Worse,”


<!-- chunk -->

### highlights a paradox: some

<!-- chunk -->

### medications appear to improve mitochondrial functions while others impair

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a class of antidepressants, increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine right outside of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. These stimulate mitochondrial activity. Lithium, a mood

<!-- chunk -->

### stabilizer, has been found to increase ATP production, enhance antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

### capacities, and improve calcium signaling within cells, all related to


<!-- chunk -->

### Quite a few antipsychotic medications are known to cause serious

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological problems, sometimes permanent ones, like tremors, muscle

<!-- chunk -->

### rigidity, and tardive dyskinesia (TD), an involuntary movement disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many studies have documented impairment in mitochondrial function at the

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular level, including decreased energy production and increased

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress, caused by these medications.


<!-- chunk -->

### One study looked at spinal

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid from patients with schizophrenia, some of whom had TD, and found a

<!-- chunk -->

### direct correlation between markers of impaired mitochondrial energy

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and the symptoms of TD.


<!-- chunk -->

### These and many other researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### have concluded that mitochondrial dysfunction is the most likely

<!-- chunk -->

### explanation for these neurological side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### In my own work with patients for more than twenty-five years now, I

<!-- chunk -->

### have seen firsthand how psychiatric medications can impair metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Weight gain, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and

<!-- chunk -->

### even premature death are all well-known side effects for many of these

<!-- chunk -->

### medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### How does this make sense? If mental symptoms are due to

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction/dysregulation, how can impairing them further

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce mental symptoms?

<!-- chunk -->

### The answer comes down to hyperexcitable cells. When a cell is

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitable, there are two ways to reduce symptoms:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.

<!-- chunk -->

### Improve mitochondrial function and energy production so that the

<!-- chunk -->

### cell can repair itself and function normally again. However, this

<!-- chunk -->

### strategy comes with the risk that symptoms might get worse initially,

<!-- chunk -->

### given that hyperexcitable cells can’t stop themselves sometimes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, when they get more energy initially, they may not be

<!-- chunk -->

### prepared to manage it appropriately, and hyperexcitability may occur.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Manage these cells by shutting them down—in other words,

<!-- chunk -->

### suppress their function by inhibiting their mitochondria. This will

<!-- chunk -->

### stop symptoms, at least in the short run. However, this strategy

<!-- chunk -->

### comes with the risk that it might make matters worse over time

<!-- chunk -->

### because it may worsen the mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is obviously a very concerning situation. A treatment that can help in

<!-- chunk -->

### the short run might make things worse in the long run. Unfortunately, the

<!-- chunk -->

### dilemma of hyperexcitability isn’t even this simple. The brain is

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated, and so is this issue. There are two other considerations:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.All cells are likely not impacted in the same ways. Recall that cells

<!-- chunk -->

### have different inputs. Medications target specific cells. Some cells

<!-- chunk -->

### may have improved mitochondrial function, while other cells may

<!-- chunk -->

### not be affected, while still others may have impairment. In all the

<!-- chunk -->

### studies done, the researchers had to choose specific cells to study.

<!-- chunk -->

### They certainly didn’t study all the cells in the brain and body.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Even if medications impair mitochondrial function broadly, we need

<!-- chunk -->

### to consider the consequences of not treating the person.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hyperexcitable cells spewing out lots of neurotransmitters, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### glutamate or dopamine, are known to be toxic to the brain. The

<!-- chunk -->

### overall benefits to the person may still outweigh the risks. An

<!-- chunk -->

### extreme example is when someone is seizing—they are clearly

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from a case of hyperexcitable brain cells. Stopping them is

<!-- chunk -->

### of paramount importance. People can die if they seize too long. And

<!-- chunk -->

### in fact, many epilepsy treatments, such as Depakote, are known to

<!-- chunk -->

### impair mitochondrial function, which then slows, and, with hope,

<!-- chunk -->

### stops the hyperexcitability.


<!-- chunk -->

### I know that people crave simple answers to dilemmas like this. “So,

<!-- chunk -->

### should people take medications that are known to impair mitochondria? Yes

<!-- chunk -->

### or no?” Unfortunately, I can’t offer a universal answer to this question

<!-- chunk -->

### because different situations require different interventions. Clearly, in

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous or life-threatening situations, these medications can be

<!-- chunk -->

### lifesaving. However, I’ve mapped out some of the issues to consider. The

<!-- chunk -->

### good news is that these questions can be addressed in research studies, so

<!-- chunk -->

### more research might better inform our treatment approaches in the future.

<!-- chunk -->

### What is clear already, however, is that suppressing mitochondrial function

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term is not a path to healing. At best, it’s a path to reducing symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The theory of brain energy answers numerous questions that the mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health field has been unable to answer to date. It outlines why medications

<!-- chunk -->

### that target serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine can all be used to treat

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. They all enhance the function of mitochondria. A logical

<!-- chunk -->

### question, then, is “Why doesn’t everyone respond to the same

<!-- chunk -->

### medications?” This comes back to preexisting vulnerabilities and different

<!-- chunk -->

### inputs to different cells. For example, the symptoms of depression come

<!-- chunk -->

### from many brain regions, not just one. Brain circuits are connected and

<!-- chunk -->

### communicate with each other. If one area is malfunctioning, it will impact

<!-- chunk -->

### the other areas, too. Some will be more responsive to serotonin while others

<!-- chunk -->

### will be more responsive to norepinephrine, and yet they are connected. So,

<!-- chunk -->

### if one brain region is metabolically compromised, it will impact the other

<!-- chunk -->

### brain regions, just like a traffic jam in one part of the city slowly backing up

<!-- chunk -->

### traffic in other parts of the city. Metabolic problems are connected and can

<!-- chunk -->

### spread.

<!-- chunk -->

### This theory also helps us understand why medications take time to

<!-- chunk -->

### work. For example, SSRIs are likely working by increasing mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis and improving the function of mitochondria. This process takes

<!-- chunk -->

### time; it doesn’t occur overnight, even though SSRIs increase serotonin in

<!-- chunk -->

### a matter of hours. It’s not the serotonin per se that results in improvement,

<!-- chunk -->

### but the impact that serotonin has on mitochondria and metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Restoring metabolic health takes time—probably about two to six weeks—

<!-- chunk -->

### which is the time it usually takes for SSRIs to start working as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### We can also understand why one medication can be used for a wide

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of disorders. For example, antipsychotic medications can be used

<!-- chunk -->

### for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### agitation in dementia because they reduce hyperexcitability in many cell

<!-- chunk -->

### types. Suppressing mitochondrial function can stop the problematic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. But anyone who has taken these medications knows that they

<!-- chunk -->

### come with side effects, like reduced function in cognitive areas of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### and increased appetite. In the elderly, they even come with a warning of

<!-- chunk -->

### increased risk of death.

<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, we can now understand why some psychiatric medications

<!-- chunk -->

### can induce other symptoms, such as antidepressants inducing anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### mania, and psychosis in some people. Antidepressants generally increase

<!-- chunk -->

### energy in the brain. In people with preexisting vulnerabilities who already

<!-- chunk -->

### have metabolically compromised cells, this can quickly lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitability and associated symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### On top of the usual psychiatric medications, the brain energy theory

<!-- chunk -->

### offers reasons why “metabolic” medications might also play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health. Interestingly, psychiatrists have been using some of these for

<!-- chunk -->

### decades now.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many blood pressure medications, such as clonidine, prazosin, and

<!-- chunk -->

### propranolol, are used in psychiatry. These medications are prescribed for a

<!-- chunk -->

### wide variety of disorders, including ADHD, PTSD, anxiety disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### substance use disorders, and Tourette’s syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study looked at three classes of “metabolic” medications in more

<!-- chunk -->

### than 140,000 patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic disorders to see if these medications had any impact on self-harm

<!-- chunk -->

### or the need for psychiatric hospitalization.


<!-- chunk -->

### They found that they did. The

<!-- chunk -->

### drug classes included “statins” for cholesterol (hydroxylmethyl glutaryl

<!-- chunk -->

### coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), blood pressure medicines (L-type

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium channel

<!-- chunk -->

### antagonists), and diabetes medicines like metformin (biguanides). Across

<!-- chunk -->

### the board, these medications had an impact on the “mental” metrics,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially in reducing self-harm. The brain energy theory offers

<!-- chunk -->

### explanations for why these might help. Statins are known to impair

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function and reduce inflammation, calcium channel blockers

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce hyperexcitability by decreasing the amount of calcium in cells, and

<!-- chunk -->

### metformin is also known to play a direct role in mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metformin gets confusing quickly, however, as the effects appear to be

<!-- chunk -->

### dependent upon the dose. Most studies have found that metformin impairs

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function, but some have found an increase in mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis and ATP production.


<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, I want to point out that reducing or stopping psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### medications can be difficult and dangerous. This always needs to be done

<!-- chunk -->

### with the supervision of a medical professional. Symptoms can get worse

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly and new symptoms can emerge. Many patients become acutely

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed, suicidal, manic, or psychotic when they stop medications

<!-- chunk -->

### abruptly or decrease them too rapidly. This doesn’t mean that people can’t

<!-- chunk -->

### discontinue medications; it just means that it isn’t something to undertake

# Success Story: Jane—Agitated in the Nursing Home

<!-- chunk -->

### Early in my career, I worked in some nursing homes as a psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### consultant. One person that I met was Jane, an eighty-one-year-old woman

<!-- chunk -->

### with Alzheimer’s disease. I was asked to see her for “agitation.” The nurses

<!-- chunk -->

### reported that she would stay up at night screaming, and at other times sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### for more than twelve hours at a stretch. Her screaming was disturbing the

<!-- chunk -->

### other residents, and they wanted me to prescribe something to stop this

<!-- chunk -->

### behavior. It had been going on for more than six months, and she had

<!-- chunk -->

### already been prescribed five tranquilizing medications, including two

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotics and anti-anxiety medications. Nothing was working. A

<!-- chunk -->

### medical workup had already been conducted and they couldn’t find

<!-- chunk -->

### anything wrong with her.

<!-- chunk -->

### I met with Jane for all of five minutes in the dining room, where she

<!-- chunk -->

### was propped into an adult high chair. When I sat down to speak with her,

<!-- chunk -->

### she couldn’t understand me. She was saying random words and phrases

<!-- chunk -->

### (something called “word salad” in psychiatry), and she was smearing her

<!-- chunk -->

### food all over herself and her high chair. I had enough information to make

<!-- chunk -->

### my diagnosis. She was delirious. The most likely cause? The sedating

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. I wrote my note and instructed the physician to get her off as

<!-- chunk -->

### many of those medications as possible, as quickly as possible, but to be

<!-- chunk -->

### mindful that some might need to be slowly tapered. The physician ended up

<!-- chunk -->

### stopping most of them right away.

<!-- chunk -->

### I came back three weeks later. As I was walking down the hall, I was

<!-- chunk -->

### confronted by an elderly woman I had never met before. She asked me if I

<!-- chunk -->

### was Dr. Palmer, and I said I was. She reached out and hugged me, with tears

<!-- chunk -->

### in her eyes, and thanked me profusely for saving her sister. I told her that

<!-- chunk -->

### she must be mistaken; I didn’t know her or her sister. She then told me that

<!-- chunk -->

### her sister was Jane. It turns out that for the past couple of years, she had

<!-- chunk -->

### been visiting Jane three times a week. They used to have pleasant

<!-- chunk -->

### conversations and share meals, but the last six months had been a

<!-- chunk -->

### nightmare. Jane was angry, confused, and just not “human” anymore. This

<!-- chunk -->

### was heartbreaking for her sister to witness. But about ten days ago, her

<!-- chunk -->

### sister told me, things began to change. Jane had stopped screaming and her

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep was improving. She knew her sister again, and they could have

<!-- chunk -->

### conversations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anyone who has visited a nursing home knows this is not a rare story. It

<!-- chunk -->

### represents a common dilemma: people with dementia can become agitated

<!-- chunk -->

### and disruptive for a variety of reasons—an infection, poor sleep, or even a

<!-- chunk -->

### seemingly minor stressor, such as moving to a new room. These can all

<!-- chunk -->

### cause delirium. Jane was likely delirious when her symptoms began six

<!-- chunk -->

### months before I met her, before she was prescribed any psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. Her screaming and sleep disruption were the reasons that these

<!-- chunk -->

### medications were prescribed in the first place. And they likely helped, at

<!-- chunk -->

### least temporarily. The nurses and physicians likely saw that these

<!-- chunk -->

### medications sedated Jane and decreased her screaming, and so they

<!-- chunk -->

### continued to prescribe them. When the symptoms came back, they tried

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing the doses or adding new medications.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the surface, it’s understandable how Jane ended up on so many

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. However, several of them are known to impair mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### function. This means that they can help in the short run, but they come with

<!-- chunk -->

### the risk of making matters worse in the long run. That appears to be what

<!-- chunk -->

### happened to Jane. By the time I saw her, whatever caused her initial

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium had probably passed, and she was delirious because of the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments she was receiving.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most healthcare professionals know that tranquilizing medications can

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes make elderly people delirious. What’s going to be more difficult

<!-- chunk -->

### for the mental health field to grapple with is the possibility that this might

<!-- chunk -->

### happen in young people, too. The brain energy theory suggests that it could,

<!-- chunk -->

### and my own clinical practice for the past twenty-five years suggests that it

<!-- chunk -->

### probably does, at least in some cases. You’ll hear about one such person

<!-- chunk -->

### later in the book.

<!-- chunk -->

### This doesn’t mean that antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications

<!-- chunk -->

### shouldn’t be used or can’t put symptoms into remission. I believe they do

<!-- chunk -->

### work for some people, and I continue to prescribe them to this day. But for

<!-- chunk -->

### Jane, they clearly ended up making her mental symptoms even worse.

<!-- chunk -->

### Removing the offending medications brought Jane back.

# Hormones and Metabolic Regulators

<!-- chunk -->

### ormones are chemical messengers that are produced in one type of

<!-- chunk -->

### cell and then travel through the body to impact other cells. The

<!-- chunk -->

### human body produces numerous hormones. All of them affect

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function and cause epigenetic changes in their target cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones change the metabolism of cells. In turn, they can play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### both mental and metabolic disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I’ve discussed, mitochondria supply energy for the production and

<!-- chunk -->

### release of hormones, and they initiate the process for several key hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormone levels are affected by a wide variety of factors. These include

<!-- chunk -->

### biological, psychological, and social factors. Hormones are one mechanism

<!-- chunk -->

### for the body to respond to stress and opportunities in the environment. In

<!-- chunk -->

### some cases, just the normal release of specific hormones can affect mood,

<!-- chunk -->

### energy, thoughts, motivations, and behaviors. Testosterone is an obvious

<!-- chunk -->

### example. Think of all the effects that it can have on men. Hormonal

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances can be caused by many factors, including autoimmune

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, stress, aging, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the cells that

<!-- chunk -->

### make the hormones.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many regulators of metabolism and mitochondrial function

<!-- chunk -->

### beyond hormones and neurotransmitters. They include things like

<!-- chunk -->

### neuropeptides, mitokines, adipokines, myokines, RNA molecules, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### messengers. Why so many factors? Because they all control different

<!-- chunk -->

### aspects of metabolic function in different cells under different

<!-- chunk -->

### circumstances. When thinking about the control of traffic, most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stoplights in a city are activated independently of each other. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are some stoplights on long roads that might be coordinated with each

<!-- chunk -->

### other. These hormones and metabolic regulators, like the different

<!-- chunk -->

### stoplights, are controlling metabolism in different cells to produce desired

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. There are many roads and desired effects in the human body, hence

<!-- chunk -->

### the need for so many regulators.

<!-- chunk -->

### I won’t provide a review of all the hormones and their relationships to

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and metabolic health. That could fill an entire book. Instead, I’ll

<!-- chunk -->

### briefly review a few—cortisol, insulin, estrogen, and thyroid hormone—in

<!-- chunk -->

### order to illustrate some of the connections between hormones, metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria.

# Cortisol

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no question that cortisol, metabolism, mitochondria, and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms are all interconnected, as I’ve discussed in previous chapters.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cortisol plays an important role in the stress response. High levels have

<!-- chunk -->

### been associated with all the metabolic disorders and numerous mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, including anxiety, fear, depression, mania, psychosis, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive impairment. High levels in utero affect fetal development and

<!-- chunk -->

### play a role in epigenetics, which can lead to the later development of both

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic and mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cortisol always begins in mitochondria, which have the enzyme that

<!-- chunk -->

### initiates its production. After cortisol gets released into the bloodstream,

<!-- chunk -->

### it enters cells and binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which then

<!-- chunk -->

### turns thousands of genes on or off by binding to specific sites on DNA

<!-- chunk -->

### called glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). The proteins from these

<!-- chunk -->

### genes then have widespread effects on cells, all related to metabolism. In

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to GRs in the cytoplasm and GREs located within the cell nucleus,

<!-- chunk -->

### it turns out that they are also located directly on/in mitochondria, too. In

<!-- chunk -->

### some ways, it’s fair to say that cortisol begins and ends with mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### At one point in psychiatry, there was hope that cortisol would be the

<!-- chunk -->

### first definitive biomarker for mental illness. The dexamethasone

<!-- chunk -->

### suppression test, which measures fluctuations in cortisol throughout the day,

<!-- chunk -->

### was widely studied. Unfortunately, cortisol levels can actually be too high

<!-- chunk -->

### or too low in different psychiatric patients. Some people have high levels

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the day while others, especially those with severe trauma

<!-- chunk -->

### histories, can have abnormally low levels. The story gets complicated

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly, and there’s still debate about how and why this happens. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### my purpose is simply to illustrate that cortisol is a hormone that directly

<!-- chunk -->

### connects metabolism and mitochondria with both metabolic and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. That much is clear and unequivocal.

# Insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people know insulin for its role in diabetes. People with type

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes have low levels because the pancreas is not making enough. People

<!-- chunk -->

### with type 2 diabetes are “insulin resistant,” meaning that insulin isn’t

<!-- chunk -->

### working effectively to allow glucose to be used as an energy source. I’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### already discussed the strong bidirectional relationships between diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Emerging evidence over the past fifteen years suggests that

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are important regulators of insulin production and secretion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are involved in glucose metabolism and sensing how much

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose is available. They ramp up production and secretion of insulin as

<!-- chunk -->

### needed.


<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are known to play a significant role in both types 1 and

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, with some experts speculating that mitochondrial dysfunction may

<!-- chunk -->

### be the primary cause. Numerous lines of evidence support these views. One

<!-- chunk -->

### review paper outlining some of the evidence suggests that mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### appear to be important to the cause, complications, management, and

<!-- chunk -->

### prevention of both types 1 and 2 diabetes.


<!-- chunk -->

### Insulin itself stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria to produce more ATP and also stimulates mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis, as measured in muscle tissue.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, when researchers did

<!-- chunk -->

### this study in people with type 2 diabetes, these effects were blunted or

<!-- chunk -->

### absent. This means that diabetics, over time, may develop even more

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction due to insulin resistance—sparking a vicious

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle. It suggests that insulin resistance can be both a cause and a

<!-- chunk -->

### consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### But the story of insulin in brain health only begins with diabetes. It

<!-- chunk -->

### plays a powerful and direct role in brain function, too.


<!-- chunk -->

### Insulin receptors are

<!-- chunk -->

### located throughout the brain, and they are involved in regulating whole-

<!-- chunk -->

### body metabolism, appetite, reproductive functions, liver functions, fat

<!-- chunk -->

### stores, and body temperature. Brain insulin also modulates neurotransmitter

<!-- chunk -->

### activity and mitochondrial function within brain cells. Changes in insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling have been associated with impairment of neuronal function and

<!-- chunk -->

### synapse formation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Insulin has been shown to influence GABA, serotonin, and dopamine

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons specifically.


<!-- chunk -->

### One group of researchers demonstrated that insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### alone can increase GABA activity.


<!-- chunk -->

### We know that insulin resistance can

<!-- chunk -->

### occur in the brain. When it does, it can result in mitochondrial dysfunction,

<!-- chunk -->

### which can then lead to neurotransmitter imbalances, which can then lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### overactivity and underactivity of neurons. I’ll walk you through a sample of

<!-- chunk -->

### the evidence to support this.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to being located on neurons, insulin receptors are also found

<!-- chunk -->

### on support cells, such as astrocytes, that play a role in providing energy for

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons. These cells can affect mood and behaviors. In animal experiments,

<!-- chunk -->

### when these insulin receptors were genetically removed, it resulted in

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in brain energy metabolism and also anxiety and depressive

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors.


<!-- chunk -->

### Insulin resistance would have similar effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another animal study more directly linked brain insulin with

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities.


<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### genetically

<!-- chunk -->

### removed brain-specific insulin receptors. This resulted in mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction, as measured by decreased ATP production and increased ROS.

<!-- chunk -->

### And sure enough, the animals displayed anxiety and depressive-like

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have evidence that insulin resistance might be playing a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### people, too. Dr. Virginie-Anne Chouinard and colleagues of mine at

<!-- chunk -->

### Harvard and McLean Hospital did brain scans in people with schizophrenia

<!-- chunk -->

### and bipolar disorder and looked at the levels of insulin resistance in their

<!-- chunk -->

### brains.


<!-- chunk -->

### They included people with recent-onset psychosis, but also their

<!-- chunk -->

### siblings who did not have psychiatric symptoms and healthy controls. We

<!-- chunk -->

### know the siblings are at higher risk of developing a mental disorder since

<!-- chunk -->

### their family members developed one. What they found was fascinating. The

<!-- chunk -->

### brains of the people with psychosis had insulin resistance compared to the

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy controls, but the normal siblings also showed signs of insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance, suggesting that insulin resistance might be a risk factor that runs

<!-- chunk -->

### in families. These researchers went on to find differences in mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### function between the patients with psychosis and their normal siblings. This

<!-- chunk -->

### all suggests that insulin resistance might come first, which then leads to

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction, which then leads to psychosis. Interestingly,

<!-- chunk -->

### none of the groups (patients, siblings, or controls) differed in terms of body

<!-- chunk -->

### mass index, body fat, cholesterol levels, or physical activity—so you would

<!-- chunk -->

### never be able to tell they had insulin resistance in their brains by looking at

<!-- chunk -->

### their outward appearance or talking to them about exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### An even more compelling study followed almost 15,000 children as

<!-- chunk -->

### they grew from the ages of one to twenty-four.


<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers measured

<!-- chunk -->

### fasting insulin levels at ages nine, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-four. They

<!-- chunk -->

### also measured the children’s risk for psychosis. What they found was

<!-- chunk -->

### alarming. Children who had persistently high insulin levels (a sign of

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin resistance) beginning at age nine were five times more likely to be at

<!-- chunk -->

### risk for psychosis, meaning that they were showing at least some worrisome

<!-- chunk -->

### signs, and they were three times more likely to already be diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder or schizophrenia by the time they turned twenty-four. This

<!-- chunk -->

### study clearly demonstrated that insulin resistance comes first, then

<!-- chunk -->

### psychosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease is also known to involve insulin resistance in the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some are calling it “type 3 diabetes.” Strong evidence has emerged that the

<!-- chunk -->

### brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease are not getting enough energy

<!-- chunk -->

### from glucose due to insulin resistance, and that this results in mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. The areas of the brain most affected have the most plaques and

<!-- chunk -->

### tangles, the hallmarks of this disorder.


<!-- chunk -->

## Insulin as a Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### So, based on all this evidence, can insulin play a role in treating mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders?

<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, the use of insulin in psychiatry isn’t new. From 1927 to

<!-- chunk -->

### the 1960s, insulin coma therapy was widely used in the treatment of serious

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders. Clinicians would inject patients with large doses of

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin until they went into a coma. This process was repeated a few times

<!-- chunk -->

### per week. Most reports from that era suggested that it was a highly effective

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment, at least for some people. At one point, it was the most widely

<!-- chunk -->

### used treatment for psychosis and severe depression in the Western world. It

<!-- chunk -->

### fell out of favor due to the advent of psychiatric medications. By no means

<!-- chunk -->

### do I want it to come back. However, insulin is making a comeback in the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health field.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease researchers have been using intranasal insulin in

<!-- chunk -->

### clinical trials for a few years now. Squirting insulin into the nose is the

<!-- chunk -->

### easiest and quickest way to get high levels of insulin directly into the brain,

<!-- chunk -->

### which overrides insulin resistance. Early results were promising. A pilot

<!-- chunk -->

### trial of intranasal insulin in 105 participants with mild cognitive impairment

<!-- chunk -->

### or Alzheimer’s disease showed maintenance of cognitive abilities and

<!-- chunk -->

### improved brain glucose metabolism as measured by PET imaging over four

<!-- chunk -->

### months.


<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, a larger subsequent trial in 289 people over twelve

<!-- chunk -->

### months showed no benefit, but there were concerns that the insulin delivery

<!-- chunk -->

### device may have malfunctioned.


<!-- chunk -->

### One research study used intranasal insulin in sixty-two patients with

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder to see if it could improve their cognitive function over

<!-- chunk -->

### eight

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks. The people who got insulin showed improvement in executive

<!-- chunk -->

### function compared to those who got placebo.


<!-- chunk -->

### Clearly, more research is needed before insulin makes it into clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### practice, but some researchers are working on that.

<!-- chunk -->

### Much more important for treatment, however, is measuring your insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### and blood glucose levels to identify problems like insulin resistance,

<!-- chunk -->

### hypoglycemia, and other issues. Although the correlation between what’s

<!-- chunk -->

### happening in the brain and what can be measured from the blood in your

<!-- chunk -->

### veins isn’t always direct, this information can be helpful, and sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### invaluable. There are many tests and tools available—fasting glucose and

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin levels, oral glucose tolerance tests, continuous glucose monitoring

<!-- chunk -->

### devices, and others. You’ll need to work with your healthcare provider to

<!-- chunk -->

### get these. If you identify a problem, there is a good chance this could be

<!-- chunk -->

### playing a role in your mental symptoms. There are many ways to address

<!-- chunk -->

### this problem that I’ll discuss in the coming chapters. Lifestyle changes can

<!-- chunk -->

### be a powerful intervention—in particular, diet and exercise.

# Estrogen

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people think of estrogen as it relates to reproductive capacity in

<!-- chunk -->

### women, but that’s only one of its many roles. The title of a science review

<!-- chunk -->

### article says it all, “Estrogen: A Master Regulator of Bioenergetic Systems in

<!-- chunk -->

### the Brain and Body.”


<!-- chunk -->

### Estrogen has profound effects on metabolism. It is known to play an

<!-- chunk -->

### important role in mental health, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. It also impacts brain metabolism directly and has widespread

<!-- chunk -->

### effects on mood, cognition, and other brain functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria make estrogen. As with cortisol, they control the first step

<!-- chunk -->

### in its synthesis. Mitochondria also contain estrogen receptors. Like cortisol,

<!-- chunk -->

### estrogen can sometimes begin and end with mitochondria. Most estrogen

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, however, are not on mitochondria but instead on the outside of

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. They are found widely throughout the brain on

<!-- chunk -->

### both neurons and glial cells, in both men and women. They are also found

<!-- chunk -->

### widely throughout the body. Nonetheless, many of the signaling pathways

<!-- chunk -->

### of estrogen, even when it binds to the receptor outside the cell, end up

<!-- chunk -->

### converging on mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Estrogen levels fluctuate throughout the month in menstruating women.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many women experience “mental” and “metabolic” symptoms related to

<!-- chunk -->

### changes in estrogen levels. This can include changes in mood, appetite, and

<!-- chunk -->

### cravings. In fact, there is a diagnosis—premenstrual dysphoric disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### (PMDD)—to describe some of the mental symptoms when they are severe.

<!-- chunk -->

### But for women diagnosed with other mental disorders, symptoms can also

<!-- chunk -->

### fluctuate like clockwork around their periods. This goes for all mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms—depression, anxiety, bipolar symptoms, psychotic symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration problems, etc.—true to the theory of brain energy. As I

<!-- chunk -->

### discussed earlier, women are twice as likely to develop depression as men.

<!-- chunk -->

### These hormonal fluctuations and their effects on women’s metabolism may

<!-- chunk -->

### explain some of this. Additionally, the blood loss from menstruation results

<!-- chunk -->

### in the loss of metabolic resources, such as iron, which can also take a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic toll.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of high risk for mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, likely due to both hormonal changes and, more importantly, the

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic toll of pregnancy. The nutrients and metabolic resources that it

<!-- chunk -->

### takes to create a child are enormous. This leaves women’s bodies

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically vulnerable. If you think about it, pregnancy comes with

<!-- chunk -->

### increased risks for both metabolic and mental disorders—weight gain (more

<!-- chunk -->

### than needed to carry a healthy child), gestational diabetes, eclampsia (which

<!-- chunk -->

### includes hypertension and seizures), and, of course, exacerbations of most

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders. Postpartum depression is well known, but some women

<!-- chunk -->

### experience postpartum mania or psychosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Menopause is associated with plummeting estrogen levels. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### women experience mental symptoms, including depression, anxiety, mania,

<!-- chunk -->

### and even psychosis. Women who had depression prior to menopause are

<!-- chunk -->

### five times more likely to become depressed around the time of menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain energy metabolism decreases broadly. One study looked at forty-three

<!-- chunk -->

### women over their transition into menopause and found that not only did

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy metabolism decline, but this was directly correlated with a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in mitochondrial health.


<!-- chunk -->

### After menopause, women are known to

<!-- chunk -->

### be at elevated risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease compared to men. In

<!-- chunk -->

### some women, these brain metabolism abnormalities can correct themselves

<!-- chunk -->

### over time, but in others, they appear to become permanent, likely putting

<!-- chunk -->

### these women at increased risk for mental disorders and Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. Researchers found a direct link between memory, estrogen, and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in rhesus monkeys.


<!-- chunk -->

### They found that female monkeys with

<!-- chunk -->

### poor memory had more malformed, donut-shaped mitochondria at synapses

<!-- chunk -->

### in the prefrontal cortex. When they surgically induced menopause in the

<!-- chunk -->

### monkeys, sure enough, they showed signs of memory impairment and the

<!-- chunk -->

### numbers of malformed, donut-shaped mitochondria increased. When they

<!-- chunk -->

### gave the monkeys estrogen replacement therapy, the memory problems and

<!-- chunk -->

### the mitochondrial abnormalities both improved.

<!-- chunk -->

## Estrogen as a Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Oral contraception is used by millions of women. These pills usually

<!-- chunk -->

### contain both estrogen and progesterone. They sometimes have adverse

<!-- chunk -->

### mood effects, but ironically, are also sometimes used to treat mood

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, such as PMDD. So, it can be confusing: Do they help, or do

<!-- chunk -->

### they hurt? In the end, there are likely differences between women, with

<!-- chunk -->

### some experiencing benefits and others experiencing adverse effects. One

<!-- chunk -->

### study looked at more than one million women between the ages of fifteen

<!-- chunk -->

### and thirty-four taking birth control pills and found that they were somewhat

<!-- chunk -->

### more likely to experience depression or use an antidepressant compared to

<!-- chunk -->

### women not on the pills.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another study looked at half a million fifteen-

<!-- chunk -->

### year-old women and found that those who were taking birth control were

<!-- chunk -->

### twice as likely to attempt suicide and three times more likely to commit

<!-- chunk -->

### suicide.


<!-- chunk -->

### Birth control pills don’t have the same levels of hormones that

<!-- chunk -->

### naturally occur in the body, so this may explain these findings. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### important for women with mood symptoms to work with their doctors to

<!-- chunk -->

### manage the risk of unwanted pregnancy and also their mental health needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hormone replacement therapy after menopause may play a role for some

<!-- chunk -->

### women. In fact, with all this emerging evidence for the role of estrogen in

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain, doses of estrogen may need to be reevaluated to optimize brain

<!-- chunk -->

### health.

# Thyroid Hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### Thyroid hormone is known as the master regulator of metabolism. As far as

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers can tell, it acts on every cell in the human body. Thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone increases metabolism, revving up mitochondria. It plays a

<!-- chunk -->

### profound role in growth, development, temperature regulation, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of every organ, especially the brain. When people have too much

<!-- chunk -->

### or too little thyroid hormone, problems are almost always evident.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although some of the mechanisms of action of thyroid hormone are still

<!-- chunk -->

### being worked out, what is clear and unequivocal are its effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. Thyroid hormone, either directly or indirectly, stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria to produce ATP or heat. Mitochondria have thyroid hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors, so they sometimes get the signal directly. However, thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone also acts through genes in the nucleus, which then impact

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. Thyroid hormone is also known to stimulate mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis, increasing the total number of mitochondria in cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### It also

<!-- chunk -->

### induces mitophagy—the mitochondrial repair process.


<!-- chunk -->

### As you know by

<!-- chunk -->

### now, these have powerful effects on human health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland is underactive,

<!-- chunk -->

### producing less thyroid hormone than the body requires. It’s most commonly

<!-- chunk -->

### due to an autoimmune disorder, but there are several other causes, too. It

<!-- chunk -->

### can lead to many metabolic and mental symptoms, including weight gain,

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity, heart disease, fatigue, brain fog, and depression. What is less well

<!-- chunk -->

### known is that it is also linked to bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### When hypothyroidism occurs during development, it can lead

<!-- chunk -->

### to profound neurological deficits (cretinism). The brain energy theory offers

<!-- chunk -->

### new ways

<!-- chunk -->

### to understand all of this. It connects all of these seemingly different

<!-- chunk -->

### illnesses through one pathway: mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Hormone as a Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Thyroid hormone has been used as a treatment for mental disorders for

<!-- chunk -->

### decades, even when people have normal levels. It is commonly used in

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment-resistant depression and bipolar disorder. However, the field has

<!-- chunk -->

### not been able to explain how or why it works. The brain energy theory

### provides an obvious explanation. Not only does thyroid hormone increase

<!-- chunk -->

### However, increasing metabolism comes with the risk of overstimulating

# Success Story: James—“It’s My Thyroid”

<!-- chunk -->

### When I first met him, James was a fifty-four-year-old man with a thirty-

<!-- chunk -->

### year history of bipolar disorder. He had recurrent depression every fall that

<!-- chunk -->

### would last until spring, despite trying more than twenty antidepressants and

<!-- chunk -->

### mood-stabilizing medications. His depression was crippling, often leaving

<!-- chunk -->

### him unable to get out of bed. He had also been diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and sleep apnea. His

<!-- chunk -->

### normal doses of thyroid medication—enough to increase his hormone levels

<!-- chunk -->

### into the “healthy” range—had done nothing to improve his depression, but

<!-- chunk -->

### we decided to try high-dose thyroid hormone as a treatment. It made a huge

<!-- chunk -->

### difference! His levels of thyroid hormone were now abnormally high, so we

<!-- chunk -->

### had to keep an eye out for side effects, such as heart arrhythmias and

<!-- chunk -->

### osteoporosis. But overall, he tolerated it quite well, and it changed his life.

<!-- chunk -->

### His recurrent depressions were all but gone. After about ten years of

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment with a high-dose of thyroid hormone, he was able to decrease the

<!-- chunk -->

### dose to a normal range and has continued to do well to this day. He still

<!-- chunk -->

### uses a low-dose antidepressant and sleep medication occasionally, but he

<!-- chunk -->

### hasn’t experienced a severe depression in many years now. At the time I

<!-- chunk -->

### used this treatment with James, I didn’t know how or why it worked. Now I

<!-- chunk -->

### do: brain energy.


# Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### nflammation plays an important role in metabolism, mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### function, mental health, and metabolic health. Therefore, it plays an

<!-- chunk -->

### important role in the theory of brain energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s start with an overarching observation—many people think of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation as a bad thing. Low-grade inflammation is often found in

<!-- chunk -->

### people with metabolic and mental disorders. Many speculate that

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroinflammation might be the root cause of at least some mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorders. Cytokine storms (an overactive inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### response) can kill people with COVID. Lingering inflammation is one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the primary suspects for the cause of long COVID, in which people have

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and neurological symptoms for months or years after infection.

<!-- chunk -->

### Autoimmune disorders are when inflammation and the immune system are

<!-- chunk -->

### attacking a person’s own body. A “leaky gut” can cause chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. For all these reasons, we have heard that inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### causes much of what ails us. We are told to decrease inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, inflammation isn’t always bad. It occurs all the time. It’s usually

<!-- chunk -->

### a normal process that plays countless beneficial roles in the human body. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is involved in fighting off infections and healing injuries. It serves

<!-- chunk -->

### important signaling functions. It is involved in the normal stress response.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammatory cytokines are a way to send stress signals throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### body and brain. Microglial cells, the brain’s immune cells, play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### brain development, learning, and memory. Without inflammation, we would

<!-- chunk -->

### die.

# Inflammation, Metabolism, and Mental States

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation is one way that the body allocates and uses metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### resources, thereby directly affecting metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### When inflammatory cytokines get released, more blood flows to that

<!-- chunk -->

### area of the body, bringing with it oxygen, glucose, amino acids, and fats to

<!-- chunk -->

### be used in some way. The inflammation is “calling” for these resources, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the body is allocating energy and supplies. This can occur due to infections

<!-- chunk -->

### or injuries, or in response to old or dying cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation can trigger the production of more immune cells and

<!-- chunk -->

### antibodies. These can be lifesaving when fighting off viruses, bacteria, and

<!-- chunk -->

### even newly formed cancer cells, but it takes energy and resources to make

<!-- chunk -->

### these. The body prioritizes dealing with these situations as they threaten the

<!-- chunk -->

### survival of the organism. Other times, the body is allocating resources to

<!-- chunk -->

### make adaptive changes, such as increasing the size of muscles after a

<!-- chunk -->

### workout or directing metabolic resources to specific brain regions for new

<!-- chunk -->

### learning. Even in these situations, inflammation is calling resources to these

<!-- chunk -->

### sites. In all these scenarios, there are fewer metabolic resources available to

<!-- chunk -->

### all the other cells in the body. In other words, inflammation takes a toll—a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic toll.

<!-- chunk -->

### High levels of inflammation can change emotions, thoughts,

<!-- chunk -->

### motivations, and behaviors. For example, when people have a viral

<!-- chunk -->

### infection or cancer, the high levels of inflammation cause mental changes as

<!-- chunk -->

### well. People become lethargic, withdrawn, unmotivated, less confident, and

<!-- chunk -->

### more likely

<!-- chunk -->

### to want to climb into bed and rest. These are all adaptive. They are normal

<!-- chunk -->

### and healthy, even though they make people feel miserable. These changes

<!-- chunk -->

### allow for the conservation of metabolic resources. The body is fighting for

<!-- chunk -->

### its survival. This is no time to go out playing, exercising, or even

<!-- chunk -->

### reproducing. All available resources need to be used for survival. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers have called this conservation-withdrawal behavior and have

<!-- chunk -->

### used these observations to better understand some of the symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### But it can go in the other direction, too. Mental states can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. One fascinating study looked at humans and monkeys who

<!-- chunk -->

### were lonely and found that loneliness increased the stress response and

<!-- chunk -->

### induced a specific pattern of immune cell activation.


<!-- chunk -->

### This left the lonely

<!-- chunk -->

### people and monkeys with chronic, low-grade inflammation. They were also

<!-- chunk -->

### more vulnerable to getting a viral infection. The researchers went so far as

<!-- chunk -->

### to infect the monkeys with a virus, and sure enough, the lonely monkeys

<!-- chunk -->

### had an impaired immune response. This helps explain why a mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom like loneliness has been linked to higher rates of not just mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders but also cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and

<!-- chunk -->

### premature death.


<!-- chunk -->

### When inflammation occurs for a prolonged period, or when it is

<!-- chunk -->

### extreme, the metabolic toll can trigger or exacerbate mental and metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. When infections, allergies, cancers, and autoimmune disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### flare up, there can be an increase in new-onset mental disorders or an

<!-- chunk -->

### exacerbation of mental symptoms in people with existing disorders. To give

<!-- chunk -->

### one surprising example, people with runny noses (rhinitis) from something

<!-- chunk -->

### like hay fever are 86 percent more likely to develop depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### These

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory conditions are also well-known causes of delirium in the

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly. Likewise, there can be an increase in the symptoms of metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Blood sugar goes up in people with diabetes. People with

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular disease can see an increase in blood pressure, experience

<!-- chunk -->

### chest pain, or suffer another heart attack.

<!-- chunk -->

### A large population study of more than one million children in Denmark

<!-- chunk -->

### found that children hospitalized for serious infections were 84 percent more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to develop a subsequent mental disorder and 42 percent more likely

<!-- chunk -->

### to be prescribed a psychiatric medication.


<!-- chunk -->

### The biggest risk was within

<!-- chunk -->

### three

<!-- chunk -->

### months of the infection. In teens, there was an eightfold increase in OCD.

<!-- chunk -->

### In case you’re thinking that all the kids were just “anxious” because they

<!-- chunk -->

### got hospitalized, the most common diagnoses included schizophrenia,

<!-- chunk -->

### OCD, personality disorders, mental retardation, autism, ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and tic disorders. These are

<!-- chunk -->

### serious brain disorders, not just “anxiety” due to a hospitalization. And as

<!-- chunk -->

### you’ll note, the diagnoses are widespread, not specific to any one disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is consistent with the brain energy theory.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are just a couple of examples of the research demonstrating that

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory conditions can lead to the development or exacerbation of

<!-- chunk -->

### both mental and metabolic disorders. But is there evidence that

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are involved?

# Inflammation and Mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation and mitochondria are in a complex feedback loop.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are involved in many aspects of the normal inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### response, turning it both on and off. Inflammation, in turn, can impair

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction, even from

<!-- chunk -->

### other causes, can lead to inflammation. It’s all a vicious cycle. I’ll walk you

<!-- chunk -->

### through some of the evidence supporting this.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria play a role in normal inflammation. In the chapter on

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, I already shared with you the study demonstrating that they

<!-- chunk -->

### are responsible for the different phases of wound healing in macrophages.

<!-- chunk -->

### One scientific article, “Mitochondria in Innate Immune Responses,”

<!-- chunk -->

### reviewed the many complex ways in which mitochondria are directly or

<!-- chunk -->

### indirectly involved in many aspects of the immune response, including

<!-- chunk -->

### fighting viruses and bacteria, but also playing a role in cell damage and

<!-- chunk -->

### stress.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another paper published in Cell found that mitochondria appear to

<!-- chunk -->

### play a role in immune cell death when the time comes to turn off the

<!-- chunk -->

### immune response.


<!-- chunk -->

### If mitochondria are not functioning properly in these

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, there will be problems with inflammation and immune cell function.

<!-- chunk -->

### It can lead to either an overactive or

<!-- chunk -->

### underactive immune and inflammatory response. These have been observed

<!-- chunk -->

### in many mental and metabolic disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation directly impacts the function of mitochondria. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), an inflammatory cytokine, has been

<!-- chunk -->

### found to directly inhibit mitochondrial function.


<!-- chunk -->

### A more important

<!-- chunk -->

### example is that of interferon, another inflammatory cytokine. Its production

<!-- chunk -->

### is strongly influenced by mitochondria, but it has also been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### directly inhibit three mitochondrial genes, resulting in changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function.


<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, interferon has been shown to directly

<!-- chunk -->

### suppress mitochondrial ATP production in some brain cells.


<!-- chunk -->

### What makes

<!-- chunk -->

### this such an important example is that interferon can be given to people as a

<!-- chunk -->

### medication when treating serious infections or cancers. Shortly after

<!-- chunk -->

### starting interferon, all hell can break loose in terms of psychiatric symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### —essentially, anything goes. The list includes depression, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability, insomnia, suicidal behavior, manic symptoms, anxiety, psychotic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, concentration difficulties, and delirium.


<!-- chunk -->

### All existing mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders can get worse with interferon. So here we go again. One drug,

<!-- chunk -->

### interferon, can produce every symptom known to psychiatry. Why?


<!-- chunk -->

### There are numerous other ways in which inflammation, immune cells,

<!-- chunk -->

### and cytokines can impact mitochondrial function, but for our purposes, the

<!-- chunk -->

### bottom line is that inflammation can cause mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation can also affect brain development. In a fetus or young

<!-- chunk -->

### child, the brain can develop abnormally due to inflammatory conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### For example, pregnant women with infections are 80 percent more likely to

<!-- chunk -->

### have a child with autism.


<!-- chunk -->

### There are many animal models of autism in

<!-- chunk -->

### which researchers inject inflammatory molecules into pregnant mice in

<!-- chunk -->

### order to induce autism in the offspring. How can we tie this all together?


<!-- chunk -->

### Inflammation can also be a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells directly impacting

<!-- chunk -->

### the inflammatory and immune response, if mitochondria in other types of

<!-- chunk -->

### cells aren’t functioning properly, that can also lead to the chronic, low-

<!-- chunk -->

### grade inflammation that we see in many people with metabolic and mental


<!-- chunk -->

### Cells that are metabolically compromised can fall into a state of disrepair.

<!-- chunk -->

### They can have maintenance problems, shrink, or die. They can have high

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of oxidative stress. All of this triggers inflammation. The cells send

<!-- chunk -->

### out signals, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), that they are

<!-- chunk -->

### in need of repair. Dead cells need to be disposed of properly. Inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### serves these purposes. In fact, mitochondria themselves, or at least parts of

<!-- chunk -->

### them, are known to be powerful DAMPs. When they are released from a

<!-- chunk -->

### struggling cell, it triggers inflammation. Inflammation in these cases is a

<!-- chunk -->

### normal response; it’s not the primary problem, but instead a symptom of a

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problem. Interfering with it likely won’t change a thing. In fact,

<!-- chunk -->

### in some cases, it might make things worse, as it can interfere with the

<!-- chunk -->

### normal healing process. The low-grade inflammation associated with all the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and metabolic disorders is likely a consequence of widespread

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic dysfunction. To address the problem, we need to understand what

<!-- chunk -->

### is causing the metabolic problems in the first place. This can include a wide

<!-- chunk -->

### variety of factors, like a poor diet, stress, hormonal problems, a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep, heavy use of alcohol or drugs, and other toxins. You’ll hear more

<!-- chunk -->

### about some of these soon enough. In order to address the problem, we must

<!-- chunk -->

### address the metabolic dysfunction in the cells. If we can restore metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### health, the inflammation will stop.

# The Role of Inflammation in Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### For decades, suppressing inflammation has been an area of great interest to

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers. They have been studying antioxidants and anti-inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### agents for both metabolic and mental disorders. Billions of dollars have

<!-- chunk -->

### been spent on this research. The list of agents includes things like vitamin

<!-- chunk -->

### E, omega-3 fatty acids, N-acetylcysteine, and nonsteroidal anti-

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory medications like ibuprofen. When all is said and done, they

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t appear to be all that effective as treatments. Their use in depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes has been

<!-- chunk -->

### disappointing, at best, even though all these disorders have been associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with higher levels of chronic inflammation. One meta-analysis showed

<!-- chunk -->

### slight benefits for some of these agents for some mental disorders, but the

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements were minimal and usually not clinically meaningful.


<!-- chunk -->

### On

<!-- chunk -->

### top of that, given that inflammation plays a role in normal brain and body

<!-- chunk -->

### functions, it’s possible that suppressing it with medications may have

<!-- chunk -->

### unintended adverse consequences over the long run.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, does inflammation matter in treatment? It does.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, there are many lifestyle factors that I already mentioned that can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause widespread metabolic dysfunction, which can then lead to chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. Addressing these can play a powerful role in decreasing

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and addressing metabolic and mental disorders. Taking an

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant to counteract the negative effects of these lifestyle factors

<!-- chunk -->

### simply doesn’t work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Autoimmune disorders are associated with high levels of inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### and play a role in mental and metabolic disorders. Addressing these is

<!-- chunk -->

### important. Sometimes, it might require anti-inflammatory treatments. In

<!-- chunk -->

### other cases, it might require addressing hormone deficiencies. You’ll need

<!-- chunk -->

### to work with your healthcare provider on all of this.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic infections can also be a serious problem. When the body is

<!-- chunk -->

### unable to eliminate a viral or bacterial infection, it takes a metabolic toll

<!-- chunk -->

### and can lead to problems. HIV, chronic Lyme disease, hepatitis, and others

<!-- chunk -->

### can play a role in metabolic and mental health. You’ll need to work with

<!-- chunk -->

### your healthcare provider to address these with optimal care.

<!-- chunk -->

### Allergies can also lead to chronic inflammation. Sometimes, allergens

<!-- chunk -->

### can be avoided, but other times, you may need to work with your healthcare

<!-- chunk -->

### provider to select appropriate treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dental hygiene can also affect inflammation, and in turn, can impact

<!-- chunk -->

### both metabolic and mental disorders. It’s important to brush and floss your

<!-- chunk -->

### teeth regularly and get regular dental checkups. This is one way to reduce a

<!-- chunk -->

### source of inflammation in your body.


<!-- chunk -->

### •Inflammation plays a powerful role in mental and metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Inflammation always affects metabolism, and metabolic problems

<!-- chunk -->

### often increase levels of inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### •For many people, poor diet, lack of exercise, poor sleep, smoking,

<!-- chunk -->

### use of alcohol or drugs, and other lifestyle factors are the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### causes of low-grade inflammation. Addressing these directly is more

<!-- chunk -->

### important than trying to reduce inflammation through other means,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as taking an antioxidant pill.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Inflammation impacts mental states, and mental states can cause

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Mitochondria are directly and indirectly involved with inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### and immune cell function.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Inflammation and mitochondria are in a complex feedback cycle,

<!-- chunk -->

### and this can play an important role in metabolic and mental health.

# S


# Sleep, Light, and Circadian Rhythms

<!-- chunk -->

### leep, light, and circadian rhythms are all interconnected. They play a

<!-- chunk -->

### powerful role in metabolism, mitochondrial function, metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, and mental disorders. Although the biology of these topics

<!-- chunk -->

### is complex, I’ll offer a high-level overview and a sample of the

<!-- chunk -->

### evidence to demonstrate that these contributing causes all play a role in the

<!-- chunk -->

### theory of brain energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we sleep at night, our bodies and brains enter a “rest and repair”

<!-- chunk -->

### state. The overall metabolic rate and temperature of the body decline while

<!-- chunk -->

### cells perform maintenance functions and make needed repairs vital to both

<!-- chunk -->

### short-term and long-term health. The brain undergoes many changes in

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons that are thought to play a role in learning and memory

<!-- chunk -->

### consolidation. Without sleep, cells can fall into a state of disrepair and

<!-- chunk -->

### begin to malfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is part of the body’s overall metabolic strategy. It is guided by

<!-- chunk -->

### circadian rhythms. The body has “clocks,” both in the brain and in virtually

<!-- chunk -->

### all cells, that govern many biological processes. In the end, they all relate to

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. An area of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic

<!-- chunk -->

### nucleus (SCN) plays a key role. The SCN detects light from our eyes and

<!-- chunk -->

### generates hormonal and nervous system responses. These signals, in turn,

<!-- chunk -->

### influence the peripheral clocks in all the cells of the body by turning

<!-- chunk -->

### thousands of genes throughout the body on or off. The circadian rhythm is

<!-- chunk -->

### largely driven by two things—light and food. It gets synchronized to cycles

<!-- chunk -->

### of light or dark and feeding or fasting.

<!-- chunk -->

### An optimal amount of sleep for adults is about seven to nine hours per

<!-- chunk -->

### night but varies among people. Age, activity level, and other factors play a

<!-- chunk -->

### role. Infants and children need more sleep as their bodies are growing. The

<!-- chunk -->

### elderly require less sleep. When people are ill, they need more sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### temporarily, as sleep helps conserve energy. Sleep allows metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### resources to be devoted to growth, maintenance, and repair functions.

<!-- chunk -->

### When a person’s safety is threatened, sleep needs to wait. Rest and

<!-- chunk -->

### repair are never as important as survival. This includes not just physical

<!-- chunk -->

### survival but also status in society. Anything that has us worried, including

<!-- chunk -->

### most psychological and social stressors, can disrupt sleep. This is normal,

<!-- chunk -->

### not a disorder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep problems can be defined as too much, too little, or poor-quality

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep. Any of them can take a metabolic toll. Problems sleeping can

<!-- chunk -->

### exacerbate all mental and metabolic disorders. Sleep deprivation can

<!-- chunk -->

### worsen depression, mania, anxiety, dementia, ADHD, schizophrenia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### substance use disorders. It can also exacerbate metabolic disorders. People

<!-- chunk -->

### with diabetes can see their blood sugars rise. People with obesity can gain

<!-- chunk -->

### more weight. People who have already had a heart attack can have another

<!-- chunk -->

### one. These are all examples of sleep problems worsening existing disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, they can also be contributing causes to the onset of such

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. There have been many studies of normal, healthy people being

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep deprived. If the sleep deprivation is extreme, it can result in

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, mania, and psychosis. Genetic

<!-- chunk -->

### studies have found an association between the clock genes and autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.


<!-- chunk -->

### Long-term studies

<!-- chunk -->

### looking at people who don’t get enough sleep have found that they are more

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to develop all the metabolic disorders as well. It can lead to and

<!-- chunk -->

### exacerbate epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, too.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleep is in a feedback cycle with mental and metabolic disorders. These

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders themselves can cause sleep problems, which can then make the

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders even worse. It’s well described that sleep problems are a common

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom of most mental disorders. What’s less well known is that sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### problems are also more common in people with obesity, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many different types of sleep disorders, including obstructive

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep apnea, when people have obstructed airways at night and stop

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing, and restless legs syndrome, when people can’t stop moving their

<!-- chunk -->

### legs at night. The most common sleep disorder, however, is plain old

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, we see strong bidirectional relationships between sleep, mental, and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders. Clearly, something is going on here. We know that

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep problems result in a stress response and increase levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. I’ve already discussed how those can impact mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders. But there’s more to the story once again. We have

<!-- chunk -->

### several lines of evidence demonstrating a feedback cycle between

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, sleep, and circadian rhythms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sleep and Circadian Rhythms Impact Mitochondrial Function

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are synchronized with our circadian rhythms. Energy

<!-- chunk -->

### production decreases at night to allow for sleep. It increases during the day,

<!-- chunk -->

### so that we can go out into the world to work and play.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers have identified a specific protein, DRP1, that plays a

<!-- chunk -->

### central role in mitochondrial fission and ATP production.


<!-- chunk -->

### The circadian

<!-- chunk -->

### clock controls this protein, which then synchronizes mitochondrial function

<!-- chunk -->

### with our daily rhythm. Interestingly, DRP1 is necessary for feedback to the

<!-- chunk -->

### circadian clock, suggesting that mitochondria may be influencing the clocks

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves through this feedback mechanism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study looked at mice and the effects of sleep deprivation on

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function in four different brain regions. They found that

<!-- chunk -->

### sleep-deprived mice had impairment of mitochondrial function in all four

<!-- chunk -->

### brain regions, but especially in the hypothalamus, an area of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### known to regulate metabolism and many hormones, such as cortisol.


<!-- chunk -->

### Hormones play a role in sleep and mitochondrial function as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Abnormal levels of cortisol through the night can be caused by sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. Cortisol levels can then impact brain function and cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment.


<!-- chunk -->

### Melatonin, which increases at night and decreases in the

<!-- chunk -->

### morning, has been found to directly stimulate mitophagy. The lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin-induced mitophagy has been tied to cognitive deficits in mice.


<!-- chunk -->

### This research suggests that poor sleep leads to mitochondrial dysfunction,

<!-- chunk -->

### which then leads to cognitive impairment, which can then lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. This hypothesis was further supported by another

<!-- chunk -->

### research group that deprived mice of sleep for nine months and then looked

<!-- chunk -->

### at mitochondrial function and the accumulation of beta-amyloid. Sure

<!-- chunk -->

### enough, the sleep-deprived mice had higher levels of mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction and beta-amyloid accumulation compared to the control

<!-- chunk -->

### group.


<!-- chunk -->

### This research helps us understand why and how chronic sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### deprivation is a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### One more example—remember NAD? This metabolic coenzyme is

<!-- chunk -->

### controlled by circadian clocks and directly influences mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### activity, resulting in more ATP production.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, when your circadian

<!-- chunk -->

### rhythm is off, your production of NAD will be off, which will throw off

<!-- chunk -->

### your mitochondrial function and your mental and metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mitochondria Play a Role in Controlling Sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### The regulation of sleep involves numerous neurons and neurotransmitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### and many aspects are still being worked out. By no means is this a simple

<!-- chunk -->

### topic.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, recent research does implicate at least one direct role for

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. A 2019 Nature article looked at neurons that are known to

<!-- chunk -->

### induce sleep in the fruit fly to determine what makes them turn on and off.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, what makes these flies fall asleep? The researchers found

<!-- chunk -->

### that it’s mitochondria. The levels of ROS in mitochondria were linked

<!-- chunk -->

### directly to

<!-- chunk -->

### specific receptors that induce sleep. The researchers summarized the

<!-- chunk -->

### importance of this finding: “Energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### —three processes implicated independently in lifespan, ageing, and

<!-- chunk -->

### degenerative disease—are thus mechanistically connected.”


<!-- chunk -->

### What these

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers left out are mental disorders, which are also connected to all of

<!-- chunk -->

### this.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another group of researchers looked at fruit flies with mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### defects and found that they, too, had disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns, further implicating mitochondria as crucial players.


<!-- chunk -->

### A study in

<!-- chunk -->

### humans with mitochondrial defects found that almost 50 percent had sleep-

<!-- chunk -->

### disordered breathing problems.


<!-- chunk -->

## Light Impacts Mitochondria and the Brain

<!-- chunk -->

### Light stimulates mitochondria, and different wavelengths of light have

<!-- chunk -->

### different effects. For example, red light tends to stimulate ATP production.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, blue light tends to inhibit ATP production and, instead, increase

<!-- chunk -->

### ROS production.


<!-- chunk -->

### The different wavelengths affect different proteins on

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. If too much of any spectrum of light is applied, mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### can produce too much ROS. This oxidative stress can damage mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves and everything else in the cell.

<!-- chunk -->

### The clearest example of “too much” light is in skin cells. When people

<!-- chunk -->

### lay out in the sun, the photons of light stimulate mitochondria in their skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### When exposure is excessive, it can lead to premature aging of the skin

<!-- chunk -->

### (moles and wrinkles) or even skin cancer.


<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria are thought to

<!-- chunk -->

### play an important role in all of this.

<!-- chunk -->

### Light exposure also affects the brain. There are at least three ways this

<!-- chunk -->

### occurs:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.I already told you about the SCN. It detects light through our eyes

<!-- chunk -->

### and sends circadian signals throughout the brain and body. These, in

<!-- chunk -->

### turn, impact mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Light exposure on your skin increases a molecule called urocanic

<!-- chunk -->

### acid (UCA) in the bloodstream. UCA travels to the brain where it

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulates neurons that make glutamate. This has a direct impact on

<!-- chunk -->

### learning and memory.


<!-- chunk -->

### So, light exposure can help you think better.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.Researchers can deliver red and near-infrared light to the scalp and

<!-- chunk -->

### even inside the nose. This treatment is called brain

<!-- chunk -->

### photobiomodulation. These lights increase ATP production, change

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium levels, and stimulate epigenetic signals through direct

<!-- chunk -->

### actions on mitochondria. They are thought to enhance the metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity of neurons, have anti-inflammatory effects, and stimulate

<!-- chunk -->

### neuroplasticity.


# The Effect of Sleep, Light, and Circadian Rhythms

# on Symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### There are countless ways that modern humans mess up sleep. We take our

<!-- chunk -->

### phones to bed with us. We read in bed—with a light, of course. We wake up

<!-- chunk -->

### in the middle of the night and turn on our computers and televisions. We

<!-- chunk -->

### stay up late gaming or binge-watching Netflix. We work night shifts. We

<!-- chunk -->

### stay out all night and party. We pull all-nighters to finish important projects

<!-- chunk -->

### due the next day. We travel far distances and get jet-lagged. All these

<!-- chunk -->

### behaviors impact our circadian rhythms and sleep, taking a metabolic toll.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others can’t sleep, no matter how hard they try. Their minds race with

<!-- chunk -->

### worry and anxiety. They get restless. They wake up in a panic and can’t get

<!-- chunk -->

### back to sleep. They snore loudly and wake up constantly. They have

<!-- chunk -->

### flashbacks of their childhood abuse. They’re afraid to sleep. Their beds

<!-- chunk -->

### have become torture chambers. This also takes a metabolic toll.

<!-- chunk -->

### On a daily basis, sleep, light, and circadian rhythms have important

<!-- chunk -->

### effects on symptoms. People with mood disorders can experience

<!-- chunk -->

### fluctuations based on the time of day; this is called diurnal variation. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### wake up feeling very depressed, but their moods improve as the day goes

<!-- chunk -->

### on. People with dementia can get agitated and more confused at night—

<!-- chunk -->

### something

<!-- chunk -->

### called sundowning. Likewise, some people with schizophrenia can get more

<!-- chunk -->

### symptomatic at night, too. The brain energy theory offers a new way to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand these well-known phenomena through mitochondria and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Seasons can also affect symptoms. People with seasonal affective

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, or depression during the winter months, are largely thought to be

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering from reduced exposure to sunlight. People with bipolar disorder

<!-- chunk -->

### can experience manic and depressive episodes around the change in

<!-- chunk -->

### seasons. The brain energy theory offers a new way to understand these

<!-- chunk -->

### changes, too.

# Sleep, Light, and Circadian Rhythms as Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Adequate sleep is critically important to mental and metabolic health. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are many ways it can play a role in treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, you might want to assess your sleep using these basic questions

<!-- chunk -->

### (any “no” responses are worrisome):

<!-- chunk -->

### •Are you getting seven to nine hours of sleep every night?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you sleep well through the night?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you wake up feeling refreshed?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Are you able to sleep well without the use of pills or substances?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you feel reasonably awake and alert throughout the day?

<!-- chunk -->

### (Frequent naps or nodding off are worrisome signs.)

<!-- chunk -->

### If you have chronic sleep problems, talk with your healthcare professional

<!-- chunk -->

### to determine what might be causing them. You might have obstructive sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### apnea, restless legs syndrome, a hormonal imbalance, or other reason for

<!-- chunk -->

### your sleep problem. Interventions such as sleep hygiene and cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can play a role in treatment. These

<!-- chunk -->

### can

<!-- chunk -->

### be done in person with a therapist, but both are now accessible over the

<!-- chunk -->

### internet, too.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sleeping pills, including over-the-counter supplements such as

<!-- chunk -->

### melatonin, can be helpful as short-term interventions for unusually stressful

<!-- chunk -->

### situations. However, sleeping pills impair the normal architecture of sleep,

<!-- chunk -->

### which may impact some of the benefits of natural sleep. They can also

<!-- chunk -->

### impair metabolism and mitochondrial function over time, so chronic use

<!-- chunk -->

### can potentially make your problems worse. Try to normalize your sleep

<!-- chunk -->

### without the use of pills. If you’ve been using sleeping pills for years, you

<!-- chunk -->

### may need professional help to get off them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Next, assess your light exposure (any “no” responses may be

<!-- chunk -->

### problematic).

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you get exposure to natural light most days, even if just through

<!-- chunk -->

### a window?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you get outside?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you open the curtains or shades to allow light in?

<!-- chunk -->

### •When you sleep, are you in a dark room with minimal or no lights?

<!-- chunk -->

### •Do you avoid exposure to video screens while in bed (phone,

<!-- chunk -->

### television, tablet, etc.)?

<!-- chunk -->

### Correcting any problems with light exposure, either not enough during the

<!-- chunk -->

### day or too much at night, can play a role in treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Bright-light therapy is an intervention that involves sitting in front of a

<!-- chunk -->

### light every morning for about thirty minutes. These are special lights that

<!-- chunk -->

### are 10,000 lux (a measure of light intensity) that mimic exposure to sunlight

<!-- chunk -->

### but are generally safe on the eyes. Bright-light therapy has been used in a

<!-- chunk -->

### wide variety of disorders, including seasonal affective disorder, bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder, major depression, postpartum depression, insomnia, traumatic

<!-- chunk -->

### brain injury, and dementia.


<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, light exposure might even play a

<!-- chunk -->

### role in treating obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### Light

<!-- chunk -->

### therapy can

<!-- chunk -->

### help to regulate your circadian rhythms and normalize your sleep, which, as

<!-- chunk -->

### you now know, can have powerful effects on your metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. I should warn you that I have seen some patients with bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder develop hypomania and even mania from bright-light therapy, so

<!-- chunk -->

### please use it cautiously if you have had mania in the past.

<!-- chunk -->

### I also mentioned brain photobiomodulation. This is still considered

<!-- chunk -->

### experimental but is being studied for a variety of conditions, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### dementia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### •Sleep, light, and circadian rhythms are all interconnected.

<!-- chunk -->

### •They all play a powerful role in metabolism, mitochondrial function,

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health, and metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Diagnosing the cause of sleep problems is important, as it may

<!-- chunk -->

### require specific treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### •There are many things that people can do to regulate sleep.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Controlling light exposure and/or using bright-light therapy can play

<!-- chunk -->

### a role in treatment for some people.

# Success Story: Kaleb—A Twelve-Year-Old Boy

# Struggling in School

<!-- chunk -->

### Kaleb lived in an upper-middle-class town and had a reasonably good life,

<!-- chunk -->

### although his parents were divorced (one on the list of adverse childhood

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences). He also had a strong family history of mental illness—his

<!-- chunk -->

### mother, father, aunts, uncles, and grandparents had suffered from

<!-- chunk -->

### depression, suicide attempts, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, and/or

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia. Beginning in preschool, he had difficulties. As he grew

<!-- chunk -->

### older, he

<!-- chunk -->

### clearly met the criteria for ADHD; he ran wild at times and was often

<!-- chunk -->

### distractible. He would get frustrated with schoolwork and throw tantrums.

<!-- chunk -->

### He started psychotherapy. His parents and teachers tried many

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions, both disciplinary strategies and behavioral rewards. Nothing

<!-- chunk -->

### worked. He started a stimulant for his ADHD, which helped for about a

<!-- chunk -->

### week, but then he couldn’t sleep. That only made the problems worse.

<!-- chunk -->

### Different doses and different stimulants were tried, but the sleep problems

<!-- chunk -->

### weren’t improving. Sleeping pills were considered, but his parents decided

<!-- chunk -->

### to stop the stimulant instead.

<!-- chunk -->

### His trouble at school worsened. His IQ and learning abilities were high;

<!-- chunk -->

### they weren’t the problem. He got support at school via an individualized

<!-- chunk -->

### education program (IEP), and eventually he was enrolled in a special

<!-- chunk -->

### education track for students struggling with social/emotional problems. He

<!-- chunk -->

### began reporting chronic depression. When frustrated, he would jab himself

<!-- chunk -->

### with a sharp pencil. When really frustrated, he would threaten suicide. In

<!-- chunk -->

### seventh grade, both the school and his therapist began recommending a

<!-- chunk -->

### mood stabilizer for presumed bipolar disorder. His parents refused and

<!-- chunk -->

### instead wanted to try a “metabolic” treatment plan.

<!-- chunk -->

### We chose two interventions based on the metabolic basis of bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. One issue we set out to address was insulin resistance. For the past

<!-- chunk -->

### couple of years, Kaleb had been gaining weight, especially around his

<!-- chunk -->

### waist, which is a marker of insulin resistance. He had taken to eating lots of

<!-- chunk -->

### sweets immediately after school “to deal with the stress of the day” and also

<!-- chunk -->

### after dinner “as a treat.” His parents allowed it given how stressful school

<!-- chunk -->

### had been for him. To address this, we recommended that he cut out all

<!-- chunk -->

### sweets during the school week. He wasn’t thrilled about this part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment plan but agreed to try it. The second intervention was aimed at

<!-- chunk -->

### better regulating his circadian rhythms and sleep, both of which are known

<!-- chunk -->

### to play a role in bipolar disorder. We used bright-light therapy every

<!-- chunk -->

### morning for at least thirty minutes. This has been shown to be effective for

<!-- chunk -->

### bipolar depression, at least in some people, and it has few side effects.


<!-- chunk -->

### He

<!-- chunk -->

### already played video games every morning “to wake up,” so we introduced

<!-- chunk -->

### the bright light while he played his video games so that it didn’t require a

<!-- chunk -->

### change in his routine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Within one month, things began to improve. His tantrums at school stopped.

<!-- chunk -->

### His depression and his focus improved. School was becoming more

<!-- chunk -->

### manageable for him.

<!-- chunk -->

### The following year, in eighth grade, Kaleb got his best grades ever—

<!-- chunk -->

### straight As. In 2020, two years after beginning these interventions, he

<!-- chunk -->

### started high school during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many of his

<!-- chunk -->

### peers were struggling with depression, anxiety, and social isolation, he

<!-- chunk -->

### thrived. He got straight As again and was taken off his IEP after the first

<!-- chunk -->

### semester. The new school couldn’t believe this well-behaved, top student

<!-- chunk -->

### was on an IEP in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Kaleb has been on this treatment plan for four years now and continues

<!-- chunk -->

### to thrive. Clearly, this specific plan won’t work for all kids who are

<!-- chunk -->

### struggling, but it worked for Kaleb. The brain energy theory helps us

<!-- chunk -->

### understand how and why.

# Food, Fasting, and Your Gut

<!-- chunk -->

### hat we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat have direct effects

<!-- chunk -->

### on metabolism and mitochondria. Everyone knows that diet plays a

<!-- chunk -->

### role in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. What most

<!-- chunk -->

### people might not know is that diet also has profound effects on mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health and the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### This field is massive. Tens of thousands of research articles and

<!-- chunk -->

### countless textbooks have explored the effects of diet on metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. Most of this research has focused on obesity, diabetes,

<!-- chunk -->

### cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and longevity. Although

<!-- chunk -->

### these researchers don’t usually see the connection with mental health, by

<!-- chunk -->

### now, I hope you do.

<!-- chunk -->

### The connections go far beyond correlations. They overlap at the level of

<!-- chunk -->

### neural circuits in the brain and, of course, the entire network of metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria within the human body. For example, the neural circuits

<!-- chunk -->

### that drive appetite and eating behaviors have also been directly implicated

<!-- chunk -->

### in addiction to tobacco, alcohol, and heroin.


<!-- chunk -->

### That’s not too surprising to

<!-- chunk -->

### most people. What might be more surprising is that the neural circuits for

<!-- chunk -->

### loneliness overlap directly with the neural circuits that warn of starvation.


<!-- chunk -->

### This study, published in Nature, showed that chronic social isolation in the

<!-- chunk -->

### fruit fly led to increased eating and decreased sleep. A “social” problem led

<!-- chunk -->

### to changes in appetite and sleep. When the researchers artificially

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated the neural circuit for social isolation, it caused the flies to eat

<!-- chunk -->

### more and sleep less. Another study identified specific GABA and serotonin

<!-- chunk -->

### neural circuits that were directly involved in obesity and anxiety and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.


<!-- chunk -->

### One neural circuit plays a role in how much you weigh and

<!-- chunk -->

### how you feel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some people call this field nutritional psychiatry, one that looks at the

<!-- chunk -->

### role of diet in mental health. Personally, I feel this is too narrow. It’s more

<!-- chunk -->

### than how diet affects brain function. It’s also about how our mental states

<!-- chunk -->

### affect our metabolism, which can impact appetite and feeding behavior,

<!-- chunk -->

### which can affect overall health. It’s a bidirectional relationship. Metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### affects mental, and mental affects metabolic.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I said, this field is massive. I can’t possibly do it justice in one

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter. Nonetheless, I will give you a tiny taste (see what I did there?) of

<!-- chunk -->

### how this field relates to mental health by running through several food-

<!-- chunk -->

### related topics and tracing how they act as contributing causes under the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy theory.

# Vitamins and Nutrients

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the easiest places to start is with vitamins and nutrients. Several

<!-- chunk -->

### vitamin deficiencies are known to cause mental and neurological disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Correcting these vitamin deficiencies can sometimes completely solve the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem. Along with hormonal imbalances, vitamin deficiencies are one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the few examples in psychiatry where there is a clearly identified problem

<!-- chunk -->

### with a simple treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Three of the best-known vitamin deficiencies that can result in mental

<!-- chunk -->

### and neurological symptoms include thiamine, folate, and vitamin B12.

<!-- chunk -->

### These vitamins should be routinely checked in patients with psychiatric and

<!-- chunk -->

### neurological disorders because if they are low, there is a clear treatment for

<!-- chunk -->

### them. What do these vitamins do? They are all required for energy

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism within mitochondria. If a person is deficient in these vitamins,

<!-- chunk -->

### they will have impaired energy production within mitochondria, aka

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction.

<!-- chunk -->

### True to the theory of brain energy, the symptoms associated with these

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiencies are widespread and include most diagnostic categories. There

<!-- chunk -->

### are many physical symptoms as well as mental symptoms. The mental ones

<!-- chunk -->

### include depression, apathy, loss of appetite, irritability, confusion, memory

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment, sleep disturbances, fatigue, hallucinations, and delusions, to

<!-- chunk -->

### name just some of them. Deficiencies in these vitamins in pregnant women

<!-- chunk -->

### can also result in developmental abnormalities in their children,

<!-- chunk -->

### highlighting the role of mitochondria in development.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other vitamins and nutrients that can easily be

<!-- chunk -->

### connected to mitochondria and metabolism, but I’ll move on. As I said, this

<!-- chunk -->

### field is massive.

# Food Quality

<!-- chunk -->

### Our food supply has changed dramatically in the last fifty years. Plants have

<!-- chunk -->

### been genetically modified. Cattle, pigs, and chickens are pumped with

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics and growth hormones to make them fatter. Processed foods are

<!-- chunk -->

### filled with artificial ingredients and often devoid of nutrition, including

<!-- chunk -->

### fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Understanding the effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### all these hormones and chemicals on human metabolism is far from clear,

<!-- chunk -->

### but research suggests they do have an impact.

<!-- chunk -->

### Junk food is often described as “junk” not only because it lacks

<!-- chunk -->

### important nutrients, but also because it usually contains highly processed

<!-- chunk -->

### and unnatural ingredients, which have been linked to poor metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have all heard arguments about which ingredients are bad for us. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### blame fat; others blame carbohydrates; still others blame animal-sourced

<!-- chunk -->

### products. The controversies are endless. I’ll walk through three examples of

<!-- chunk -->

### dietary factors that have been directly linked to mitochondrial function and

<!-- chunk -->

### both metabolic and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are man-made, processed fats that were

<!-- chunk -->

### originally marketed as a healthier alternative to saturated fats. We were told

<!-- chunk -->

### that “healthy vegetable shortening” was far better than lard. For years,

<!-- chunk -->

### TFAs were ubiquitous in the US food supply. Tragically, it turns out that

<!-- chunk -->

### they are in fact toxic to human health, and they have now been banned in

<!-- chunk -->

### the US. Their use has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, depression, behavioral aggression, irritability, and Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### Although the exact mechanisms are still unclear, one animal study

<!-- chunk -->

### tried to figure it out by assessing what impact TFAs might have on rats and

<!-- chunk -->

### their babies.


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers gave pregnant and lactating rats either TFAs or

<!-- chunk -->

### soybean/fish oil with their diets. When the baby rats were born, they got a

<!-- chunk -->

### normal diet without TFAs. At sixty days, the babies from the mothers who

<!-- chunk -->

### got TFAs showed greater anxiety, higher levels of ROS, greater

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, and reduced glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus.

<!-- chunk -->

### This one study demonstrates how several things I’ve discussed so far are all

<!-- chunk -->

### interconnected. A single factor in a mother’s diet ended up affecting her

<!-- chunk -->

### children’s anxiety, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and

<!-- chunk -->

### glucocorticoid receptor levels, which plays a role in the stress response.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wow! Luckily, these have been banned in the US as of 2018, but could

<!-- chunk -->

### something like this account for the higher rates of depression and anxiety in

<!-- chunk -->

### the youth of America? I described how parents can transmit a vulnerability

<!-- chunk -->

### to mental illness from their own trauma history. What this research suggests

<!-- chunk -->

### is that if your mother ate trans fats while she was pregnant with you, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### possible that this might play a role in your metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes, junk food isn’t called junk because of the “bad” things in it,

<!-- chunk -->

### but instead because of the “good” things that it doesn’t contain. Let’s look

<!-- chunk -->

### at fiber. As you likely know, fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, and whole

<!-- chunk -->

### grains and is highly recommended these days. Most experts are certain that

<!-- chunk -->

### it plays a beneficial role in metabolic health and aging. Some studies

<!-- chunk -->

### suggest that it also plays a role in mental health. High levels of adherence to

<!-- chunk -->

### the Mediterranean diet, which includes lots of fruits, vegetables, whole

<!-- chunk -->

### grains, and olive oil, has been associated with lower rates of depression and

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive impairment.


<!-- chunk -->

### One of the biggest benefits of fiber is its conversion

<!-- chunk -->

### by microbes in the gut into butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid. Butyrate, in

<!-- chunk -->

### turn, serves as a primary fuel source for the mitochondria in gut cells

<!-- chunk -->

### (colonocytes). It also plays a role in liver cells. One research group found

<!-- chunk -->

### that butyrate directly changes mitochondrial function, efficiency, and

<!-- chunk -->

### dynamics (fusion/fission), and that these changes directly impact insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance, fat accumulation in the liver, and overall metabolism.


<!-- chunk -->

### There are

<!-- chunk -->

### strong connections between the gut and the brain that I’ll get to shortly, but

<!-- chunk -->

### interestingly, butyrate itself appears to directly play a role in sleep! And

<!-- chunk -->

### even more fascinating is that the mechanism appears to be located in the

<!-- chunk -->

### liver or the vein going to the liver (portal vein). Researchers studied mice to

<!-- chunk -->

### work this all out.


<!-- chunk -->

### They injected butyrate into their guts or their portal veins

<!-- chunk -->

### and found that the mice slept 50 to 70 percent more. When they injected

<!-- chunk -->

### butyrate into other parts of their bodies, it did nothing for sleep. Another

<!-- chunk -->

### research study found that butyrate decreases neuroinflammation in aging

<!-- chunk -->

### mice, something that might protect against Alzheimer’s disease.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes, it’s not about one specific ingredient. Instead, it might have

<!-- chunk -->

### more to do with how much we eat. Junk food can be addictive, at least for

<!-- chunk -->

### some of us. We all know the saying, “You can’t eat just one.” Is overeating

<!-- chunk -->

### the problem? This can lead to high levels of insulin and blood glucose,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially in people with insulin resistance. I already told you how insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance is related to mental disorders and mitochondria. Does high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose play a more direct role? Some research suggests that it does.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study in diabetic rats found that high levels of glucose directly

<!-- chunk -->

### impaired mitochondria, as measured by decreased ATP production,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased oxidative stress, and decreased antioxidant capacities, and that all

<!-- chunk -->

### of this likely damages neurons.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another study looked at human endothelial cells (cells that line arteries)

<!-- chunk -->

### to see if high glucose levels affect their mitochondrial function. They found

<!-- chunk -->

### that it does. Although it didn’t change baseline energy production, when the

<!-- chunk -->

### cells were stressed, those exposed to high levels of glucose had impaired

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to produce more energy. Again, a paradox. More glucose, or fuel, led

<!-- chunk -->

### to lower levels of ATP.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another study looked at twenty people with diabetes to see what impact

<!-- chunk -->

### high blood glucose had on their mood and brain function.


<!-- chunk -->

### They used a

<!-- chunk -->

### clamp technology to artificially control blood glucose and exposed all the

<!-- chunk -->

### people to both normal and high glucose levels. High glucose led to

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment in processing speed, memory, and attention, and also led to

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced energy levels, increased sadness, and anxiety. This research

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that if people with insulin resistance overeat comfort foods, it

<!-- chunk -->

### might actually cause them to feel sad and anxious and have cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, a meta-analysis of forty-six studies that included over 98,000

<!-- chunk -->

### participants who did not yet have diabetes looked at levels of blood glucose

<!-- chunk -->

### to see if this increased risk for brain changes related to Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers found that higher levels of blood glucose increased risk for

<!-- chunk -->

### higher levels of amyloid and brain shrinkage.


<!-- chunk -->

### Could elevated blood glucose account for the higher rates of depression

<!-- chunk -->

### and Alzheimer’s disease in people with diabetes? All of this research

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that it might play a role.

<!-- chunk -->

### But wait . . . it’s another feedback loop! It turns out mitochondria play a

<!-- chunk -->

### direct role in controlling glucose levels. A study published in Cell found

<!-- chunk -->

### that mitochondria in the cells of the ventromedial nucleus of the

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothalamus (VMH), an area of the brain known to regulate glucose levels

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the body, were critical in this regulation.


<!-- chunk -->

### Their fission with

<!-- chunk -->

### each other and their levels of ROS directly control glucose levels

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the body. So, if these mitochondria aren’t functioning properly,

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose regulation will be off. This, in turn, might cause sadness, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### and increase the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

# Obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### Obesity is a complex topic. Most people think of it as a problem of

<!-- chunk -->

### overeating—people are eating more calories than they are burning. But

<!-- chunk -->

### “eating more calories than they are burning” has two parts. Sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### people are eating too much food—in that case the question is why they are

<!-- chunk -->

### eating

<!-- chunk -->

### too much. But the second part of the equation is burning calories. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### people who struggle with obesity can eat very little and still fail to lose

<!-- chunk -->

### weight. Therefore, a better question is this: Why are those who are obese

<!-- chunk -->

### storing so much fat and/or not burning it? The reality is that almost

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone overeats on occasion. Think of Thanksgiving. Those who are thin

<!-- chunk -->

### can feel stuffed even into the next day. This drives them to eat less. Or their

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism increases to burn off the excess calories. Either way, they go on

<!-- chunk -->

### being thin. Obese people don’t have the same responses. In fact, sometimes,

<!-- chunk -->

### when obese people lose weight, their metabolism plummets. It fights their

<!-- chunk -->

### efforts to lose weight.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are complex topics. I’m not going to try to address them here.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead, my goal is to highlight that obesity does play a role in metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondrial function, and mitochondria play a role in obesity. These

<!-- chunk -->

### things, in turn, are all related to mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve mentioned that loneliness, anxiety, depression, and sleep share

<!-- chunk -->

### some neural circuits with appetite and feeding behaviors. What would

<!-- chunk -->

### happen to someone if these neural circuits were hyperexcitable? Well, that

<!-- chunk -->

### person would feel depressed, anxious, inappropriately lonely, have trouble

<!-- chunk -->

### sleeping, and would overeat. Do you know anyone like that? I can tell you

<!-- chunk -->

### that I’ve met many people exactly like this in my career as a psychiatrist.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both obesity and mental disorders are associated with mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. When people have both, these conditions can make each other

<!-- chunk -->

### worse. Mental disorders can lead to even more weight gain. Obesity can

<!-- chunk -->

### lead to even more depression, anxiety, and bipolar symptoms. One study

<!-- chunk -->

### looked at bipolar patients, some who were obese and others who weren’t,

<!-- chunk -->

### and found that the obese patients had more depressive episodes than the

<!-- chunk -->

### thin ones.


<!-- chunk -->

### Obesity itself was playing a role in their mood symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### One way to understand some of this is through insulin. I’ve already

<!-- chunk -->

### shared some information about insulin, mitochondrial function, and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function. People with obesity usually have insulin resistance, in both their

<!-- chunk -->

### bodies and brains. One group of researchers specifically looked to see if

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction is playing a role, and sure enough, they found

<!-- chunk -->

### signs of mitochondrial impairment in both the brains and livers of insulin-

<!-- chunk -->

### resistant rats.


<!-- chunk -->

### Insulin resistance takes on a life of its own, though. The pancreas responds

<!-- chunk -->

### to insulin resistance by pumping out more insulin. If a little isn’t working,

<!-- chunk -->

### then send out a lot. That helps! But the problem is that higher levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin usually make insulin resistance even worse over time. They drive

<!-- chunk -->

### hunger and weight gain. And one of the problems with higher and higher

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of insulin is that insulin resistance alone inhibits mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### biogenesis, compounding the metabolic problem.


<!-- chunk -->

### In the brain, insulin plays a direct role in how mitochondria respond to

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. When insulin signaling is working fine, mitochondria respond to

<!-- chunk -->

### stress effectively. One way to stress mitochondria in mice is to feed them a

<!-- chunk -->

### high-fat diet (HFD), which usually leads to obesity. Researchers studied

<!-- chunk -->

### mice with insulin resistance being fed an HFD and found impairment in the

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response in mitochondria.


<!-- chunk -->

### When they gave the mice intranasal

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin, the mitochondria responded normally again, and interestingly, the

<!-- chunk -->

### mice gained less weight. So, helping mitochondria function properly helped

<!-- chunk -->

### the mice deal more effectively with the HFD.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another research group also looked at the role of mitochondria in brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells of mice given an HFD.


<!-- chunk -->

### They found that microglial cells were

<!-- chunk -->

### causing brain inflammation in response to the HFD. This occurred before

<!-- chunk -->

### the mice gained any weight. When they looked further to see what was

<!-- chunk -->

### driving the changes in the microglial cells, they found that it was

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. There was an increase in a specific mitochondrial protein,

<!-- chunk -->

### UCP2, that was driving changes in mitochondrial dynamics (movement,

<!-- chunk -->

### fusion, and fission). When the researchers deleted this protein, the mice no

<!-- chunk -->

### longer had brain inflammation, and shockingly, did not develop obesity

<!-- chunk -->

### even though they continued to have access to the high-fat diet. Instead,

<!-- chunk -->

### these mice ended up eating less and were burning more calories. This study

<!-- chunk -->

### suggests that mitochondria are, in fact, key players in how the brain and

<!-- chunk -->

### body respond to high-calorie foods. Two other studies published in Cell

<!-- chunk -->

### confirm a direct role of mitochondria in brain cells in the regulation of

<!-- chunk -->

### feeding behaviors, obesity, and leptin resistance.


<!-- chunk -->

### When I first read this study, I was confused. The researchers clearly

<!-- chunk -->

### demonstrated a direct role of mitochondria in both brain inflammation and

<!-- chunk -->

### subsequent obesity. However, they interfered with what the mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### were normally doing. So, one way to look at this study is to think that the

<!-- chunk -->

### microglial mitochondria were dysfunctional and the researchers prevented

<!-- chunk -->

### them from making a mistake. Another way to look at it is that these

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria were receiving erroneous signals from somewhere else in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, maybe the gut microbiome, or gut cells, or the liver. Or maybe it was

<!-- chunk -->

### due to insulin resistance, as I described earlier. But another distinct

<!-- chunk -->

### possibility is that the mitochondria were doing exactly what they are

<!-- chunk -->

### programmed to do; they may have been looking out for the long-term health

<!-- chunk -->

### of the organism. At this point, we don’t know what the correct response

<!-- chunk -->

### should be to a toxic diet. Maybe obesity is a better survival strategy when

<!-- chunk -->

### consuming toxic foods. We can’t be certain that preventing the

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and obesity in this case would lead to better health outcomes

<!-- chunk -->

### or longevity, but I suppose that study would be easy enough to do. As you

<!-- chunk -->

### can see, it’s complicated. And then again . . . it’s not. If you want to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### obesity in mice, don’t feed them the toxic diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Just for the record, the “high-fat diet” can also contain other unhealthy

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients, such as sucrose—it’s often the evil combination that is so

<!-- chunk -->

### fattening. I mention this because I will soon be discussing a different type

<!-- chunk -->

### of high-fat diet that usually results in weight loss and lower levels of

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, so it’s not the fat, per se.

# Fasting, Starvation, and Eating Disorders

<!-- chunk -->

### Fasting is going without food. For any amount of time, really. We all fast

<!-- chunk -->

### when we sleep. That’s why breakfast has its name—it’s breaking a fast.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fasting for longer periods of time results in many changes to metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria. Interestingly, it can also have profound, beneficial effects

<!-- chunk -->

### on the human body. To most people, this is surprising. We usually think

<!-- chunk -->

### about our bodies needing food and nutrients. We’ve all heard that we need

<!-- chunk -->

### three square meals a day. Some of us have been told to eat six or eight times

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the day. We need to keep fueling our bodies. We need the

<!-- chunk -->

### energy.

<!-- chunk -->

### For infants, this is unequivocally true—most need feedings every two

<!-- chunk -->

### hours. For children who are growing, this can be true as well. But for

<!-- chunk -->

### adults, there is now a tremendous amount of science to suggest that eating

<!-- chunk -->

### all the time actually harms health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fasting prompts the body to be frugal and encourages autophagy, which

<!-- chunk -->

### has tremendous healing potential. The body hunkers down and makes do

<!-- chunk -->

### with what it has. It’s time to tap those fat stores. We all know that can be

<!-- chunk -->

### good. But there’s more to the story than that. Each and every cell responds,

<!-- chunk -->

### and mitochondria are right there to direct things. They immediately change

<!-- chunk -->

### shape. They elongate themselves, fuse with each other, and form long

<!-- chunk -->

### tubular networks.


<!-- chunk -->

### What ensues is a spring-cleaning, if you will. The cells

<!-- chunk -->

### identify old and defective proteins and cell parts. They are the first to go in

<!-- chunk -->

### a massive recycling campaign. These proteins and parts are shuttled to

<!-- chunk -->

### lysosomes for degradation. These nutrients are then recycled; some get used

<!-- chunk -->

### for energy, while others might be used for new, essential proteins and cell

<!-- chunk -->

### parts. The cells are looking for anything and everything that is expendable

<!-- chunk -->

### in a carefully orchestrated reboot.

<!-- chunk -->

### So, what about the cells’ mitochondria? Are they also getting

<!-- chunk -->

### destroyed? Well, the defective ones are, as mitophagy also gets activated

<!-- chunk -->

### during this process. But the healthy mitochondria are now working with

<!-- chunk -->

### each other in the long tubular networks. They keep up the pace of ATP

<!-- chunk -->

### production during this process, and these networks protect them from being

<!-- chunk -->

### recycled. When the person eats again, the cell parts that got destroyed get

<!-- chunk -->

### replaced. These replacement parts are new and healthy, and they often

<!-- chunk -->

### include some new mitochondria!

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if people go without food for too long, at some point, it turns

<!-- chunk -->

### into starvation. The body mounts a defense strategy. It lowers metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### broadly to conserve energy. Heart rate slows. Body temperature declines.

<!-- chunk -->

### People become sluggish, irritable, unmotivated, distractible, obsessed with

<!-- chunk -->

### food, and somewhat depressed. Paradoxically, symptoms of hypomania can

<!-- chunk -->

### emerge within the first week or two of starvation. This is likely an adaptive

<!-- chunk -->

### strategy to give the starving person enough energy, motivation, and

<!-- chunk -->

### confidence to get food, no matter what.

<!-- chunk -->

### As I’m sure you know, this is not good. It’s life-threatening. Cells begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### malfunction and die off. Organs are struggling, and this includes the brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The list of mental symptoms and diagnoses includes depression, irritability,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, mania, eating disorders, confusion, memory disturbances,

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations, and delusions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Perhaps the best evidence for the mental effects of starvation come from

<!-- chunk -->

### the famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment, in which thirty-six healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### men were subjected to semi-starvation diets (half their normal daily

<!-- chunk -->

### calories) for twenty-four weeks, and then received twenty weeks of

<!-- chunk -->

### “rehabilitation.” The men lost significant amounts of weight and showed

<!-- chunk -->

### signs of slowed metabolism. They experienced wide-ranging and

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes severe mental symptoms, including depression, anxiety, fatigue,

<!-- chunk -->

### poor concentration, and obsessions with food. Some became transiently

<!-- chunk -->

### hypomanic. Interestingly, it was during the refeeding period that some had

<!-- chunk -->

### the most difficulty. Depression got worse in some of them. Others began

<!-- chunk -->

### binging and purging. Some developed body image concerns. One man cut

<!-- chunk -->

### off three fingers. This study is often used today to understand some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of anorexia and bulimia. Starvation itself can cause mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms.


<!-- chunk -->

### This leads to a discussion of eating disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### For some people, an eating disorder can start through societal pressure

<!-- chunk -->

### to lose weight and be thin. Young, female ballet dancers are an obvious

<!-- chunk -->

### example. Many young women who dance are told in no uncertain terms that

<!-- chunk -->

### they must be thin to compete. There is tremendous pressure to lose weight.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the girls and women who follow these recommendations, they can put

<!-- chunk -->

### themselves into starvation. This can start the vicious cycle of metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disturbances that impact brain function. The parts of the brain that control

<!-- chunk -->

### feeding behaviors are impacted, but so are the parts of the brain that

<!-- chunk -->

### interpret how they perceive their bodies. They can develop severe

<!-- chunk -->

### distortions in body image, thinking they are fat when they are truly

<!-- chunk -->

### emaciated. This sometimes verges on delusional, because the way they

<!-- chunk -->

### perceive themselves can be so far removed from how they really look.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers looked at a mouse model of anorexia to see if, in fact, there is

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial impairment in the brain, and sure enough, they found

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress and

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment of specific parts of mitochondria within the hypothalamus.


<!-- chunk -->

### A

<!-- chunk -->

### study of forty women, half with anorexia and the other half without, found

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial dysfunction in the white blood cells of those with anorexia.


<!-- chunk -->

### However, other people can develop an eating disorder because of a

<!-- chunk -->

### preexisting vulnerability. Eating behaviors impact metabolism, whether it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### overeating or undereating. For some, this can result in short-term,

<!-- chunk -->

### rewarding feelings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Binge eating can make some people feel better because it provides more

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin and glucose to struggling brain cells, and it stimulates the reward

<!-- chunk -->

### centers in the brain. This may be the quickest and easiest way to overcome

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin resistance—eat a lot of sugar. Unfortunately, as I just discussed, this

<!-- chunk -->

### makes matter worse over time. For others, restricting eating can improve

<!-- chunk -->

### mood because it can provide stress hormones or ketones (you’ll hear more

<!-- chunk -->

### about these soon) that can be helpful to struggling brain cells. These two

<!-- chunk -->

### extremes of overeating and undereating can both produce rewarding

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences in different people. So, for people with preexisting mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders who are already struggling, changing eating behaviors can be

<!-- chunk -->

### appealing. For some, it can become a way of life, even if it causes health

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. This likely explains why people with all mental disorders are

<!-- chunk -->

### more likely to develop an eating disorder. They are looking for ways to feel

<!-- chunk -->

### better.

# The Gut-Brain Axis and the Microbiome

<!-- chunk -->

### Over the past few decades, a growing body of research suggests that our

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal tract plays an important role in both metabolic and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many signals get sent from the digestive tract to the brain, and vice versa.

<!-- chunk -->

### There appear to be many mechanisms by which this communication occurs.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ll briefly look at a few of them.

<!-- chunk -->

### First, it has become increasingly clear that the trillions of bacteria,

<!-- chunk -->

### fungi, and viruses in our guts play an important role in human health,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. For example,

<!-- chunk -->

### animal studies

<!-- chunk -->

### have shown that gut microbes can affect weight. In one study, researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### found that the microbiome in obese mice extracts more nutrients and

<!-- chunk -->

### calories from food than in thin mice. When this obese microbiome is

<!-- chunk -->

### transferred to thin mice, the thin mice gain weight.


<!-- chunk -->

### There is also increasing evidence for the role of the gut microbiome in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders. Animal models and small human trials have shown that

<!-- chunk -->

### the gut microbiome appears to play a role in depression, anxiety, autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders. There is also evidence

<!-- chunk -->

### for the role of the gut microbiome in epilepsy and neurodegenerative


<!-- chunk -->

### Gut bacteria get first dibs on all the food we eat. They produce a variety

<!-- chunk -->

### of metabolites, neurotransmitters, and hormones that they secrete into our

<!-- chunk -->

### guts. These get absorbed into our bloodstream and can affect our

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and brain function.

<!-- chunk -->

### A second way that signals get sent from the gut to the brain is through

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones and neuropeptides that are produced in the cells that line the

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal tract. These, too, are known to travel throughout the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### including to the brain, and have widespread effects on metabolism and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, the gut has an intricate nervous system unto itself that

<!-- chunk -->

### communicates directly with the brain and vice versa. The vagus nerve plays

<!-- chunk -->

### an important role in this communication. As I mentioned, about 90 percent

<!-- chunk -->

### of the body’s total serotonin is produced in the intestinal tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### This field of the gut-brain axis and the microbiome can quickly become

<!-- chunk -->

### overwhelming when one begins to think about all the different microbes,

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolites, hormones, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and other factors

<!-- chunk -->

### involved. However, there is a clear connection between all these factors.

<!-- chunk -->

### They all relate to metabolism and mitochondria. There is evidence that gut

<!-- chunk -->

### microbes send signals directly to mitochondria in the cells lining the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### and immune cells. These signals have been shown to change mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, alter the barrier function of the gut cells, and can lead to

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation.


# Food, Fasting, and the Gut Microbiome as

# Treatments

<!-- chunk -->

### There are at least eight different ways that dietary interventions can be

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful in addressing mental symptoms:


<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Addressing nutritional deficiencies, such as folate, vitamin B12, and

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2.Removing dietary allergens or toxins. For example, some people

<!-- chunk -->

### have an autoimmune disorder called celiac disease that results in

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation and other metabolic problems in response to gluten.

<!-- chunk -->

### This can also affect brain function. I’ve described the toxic effects of

<!-- chunk -->

### TFAs. There are many other dietary ingredients that can also impair

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3.Eating a “healthy diet,” such as the Mediterranean diet, may play a

<!-- chunk -->

### role for some people.

<!-- chunk -->

### 4.Exploring fasting, intermittent fasting (IF), and fasting-mimicking

<!-- chunk -->

### diets (more below on all three) that stimulate autophagy and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitophagy to improve metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

### 5.Improving the gut microbiome (more on how below).

<!-- chunk -->

### 6.Improving metabolism and mitochondrial function with a dietary

<!-- chunk -->

### intervention. This includes changes in insulin resistance, metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### rate, the number of mitochondria in cells, the overall health of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, hormones, inflammation, and many other known

<!-- chunk -->

### regulators of metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### 7.Dietary changes that result in losing weight can help to mitigate the

<!-- chunk -->

### problems associated with obesity.

<!-- chunk -->

### 8.Dietary changes that result in gaining weight can be a life-saving

<!-- chunk -->

### intervention for those who are severely underweight.

<!-- chunk -->

### A comprehensive discussion of all these areas is beyond the scope of this

<!-- chunk -->

### book. Instead, I’ll discuss a few highlights.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamins and Nutraceuticals

<!-- chunk -->

### Addressing vitamin and nutritional deficiencies is important. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### taking twenty-plus vitamins and supplements is not the answer to most

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problems. Sometimes, excessive use of vitamins and supplements

<!-- chunk -->

### can actually cause metabolic problems. Healthy metabolism is about

<!-- chunk -->

### balance—not too much and not too little.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many vitamins and supplements, or nutraceuticals, might play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### improving mitochondrial function and production. The list of possibilities is

<!-- chunk -->

### long. It includes L-methylfolate, Vitamin B12, SAMe, N-acetylcysteine

<!-- chunk -->

### (NAC), L-tryptophan, zinc, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, nicotinamide

<!-- chunk -->

### riboside, alpha-lipoic acid, arginine, carnitine, citrulline, choline, co-

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme Q10, creatine, folinic acid, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, resveratrol,

<!-- chunk -->

### pterostilbene, and antioxidants.


<!-- chunk -->

### It’s unlikely that all of these will be

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial for all people, and by no means should anyone take all of these at

<!-- chunk -->

### the same time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s a great example to illustrate this caution. Researchers gave

<!-- chunk -->

### patients with bipolar depression one of three treatments: (1) a

<!-- chunk -->

### “mitochondrial cocktail,” (2) NAC alone, or (3) placebo for sixteen weeks

<!-- chunk -->

### as an add-on to their existing treatments.


<!-- chunk -->

### The mitochondrial cocktail

<!-- chunk -->

### included N-acetylcysteine, acetyl-L-carnitine, Co Q10, magnesium,

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium, vitamin D3, vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin A, biotin,

<!-- chunk -->

### thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinamide, calcium pantothenate, pyridoxine

<!-- chunk -->

### hydrochloride, folic acid, and vitamin B12. Wow! That’s a cocktail. And

<!-- chunk -->

### guess what they found? No difference in any of the groups.

<!-- chunk -->

### Again, low levels of these vitamins and other factors may simply be a

<!-- chunk -->

### consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, not the cause of it. If that’s the

<!-- chunk -->

### case, adding more may not solve the problem. And pills like this don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### automatically stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy. But dietary

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions, good sleep, stress reduction, removing mitochondrially

<!-- chunk -->

### impairing medications, and exercise can!

<!-- chunk -->

## Diet and Fasting

<!-- chunk -->

### I shared with you that people who adhere to the Mediterranean diet (MD)

<!-- chunk -->

### are less likely to develop depression. But for people who are already

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed, can adopting this diet improve symptoms? It appears that it can,

<!-- chunk -->

### at least for some people. One trial, cleverly called the SMILES trial,

<!-- chunk -->

### randomized sixty-seven people with major depression to groups that

<!-- chunk -->

### encouraged people to follow the MD or a social support group (the control

<!-- chunk -->

### group). Participants continued their existing treatments for depression

<!-- chunk -->

### (medications or therapy). After twelve weeks, 32 percent of the people in

<!-- chunk -->

### the MD group achieved remission compared with only 8 percent in the

<!-- chunk -->

### control group.


<!-- chunk -->

### Is there any evidence that this is due to metabolism or

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria? Well, we have at least one study to call upon.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers looked at monkeys (cynomolgus macaques) fed an MD

<!-- chunk -->

### versus a Western diet (standard American diet) for thirty months and then

<!-- chunk -->

### measured brain mitochondrial function, energy utilization patterns, and

<!-- chunk -->

### biomarkers such as insulin levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### They found diminished bioenergetic

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns between brain regions in the monkeys getting the Western diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### which correlated with levels of insulin and glucose. The mitochondria in the

<!-- chunk -->

### MD-fed animals maintained normal differences between brain regions,

<!-- chunk -->

### whereas the mitochondria in the Western-fed animals lost these normal

<!-- chunk -->

### distinctions. The brain areas affected are known to play a role in diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### and Alzheimer’s disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is also evidence that fasting, intermittent fasting (IF), and fasting-

<!-- chunk -->

### mimicking diets may play a role in treating mental disorders. They all result

<!-- chunk -->

### in the production of ketone bodies, which are made when fat is being used

<!-- chunk -->

### as an energy source. Fat gets turned into ketones. And, interestingly, this

<!-- chunk -->

### process occurs exclusively in mitochondria, yet another role for these

<!-- chunk -->

### magnificent organelles.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ketones are an alternate source of energy to cells. They also serve as

<!-- chunk -->

### important metabolic signaling molecules, resulting in epigenetic changes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ketones can be a rescue energy source to insulin-resistant brain cells. While

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose might have trouble getting into these cells, ketones can get inside

<!-- chunk -->

### pretty easily. Fasting also results in autophagy, as I’ve described. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### several versions of IF. Some restrict eating to eight to twelve hours per day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Others allow one meal a day. And others restrict nighttime eating.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have evidence that IF improves mood and cognition, and protects

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons from damage in animal models of epilepsy and Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. One group of researchers set out to understand how and why.


<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll never guess what they found—it’s mitochondria! When researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### put mice on an IF routine, they found that the hippocampus, a brain region

<!-- chunk -->

### often involved in depression, anxiety, and memory disorders, was largely

<!-- chunk -->

### driving the improvements from IF. It appeared to be due primarily to higher

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of GABA activity, which reduced hyperexcitability. Then the

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers went further to understand what was causing this change in

<!-- chunk -->

### GABA activity. They removed sirtuin 3 from the mice in two different ways

<!-- chunk -->

### —recall that this protein is exclusive and essential to mitochondrial health.

<!-- chunk -->

### When they did this, all the benefits were lost. This clearly implicates

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria directly in the benefits of IF on brain health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another review article outlines many of the ways that IF is thought to

<!-- chunk -->

### promote brain health, including reducing oxidative stress and inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### improving mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing brain-

<!-- chunk -->

### derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), improving neuroplasticity, and

<!-- chunk -->

### promoting cellular stress resistance.


<!-- chunk -->

### These are powerful healing

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions not currently available in a pill.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fasting-mimicking diets can replicate the benefits of fasting for longer

<!-- chunk -->

### periods of time without the risk of starvation. The best-known example is

<!-- chunk -->

### the ketogenic diet. You likely recall that it was this diet and its profound

<!-- chunk -->

### impact on one of my patients that led me on this journey.

<!-- chunk -->

### The story of the ketogenic diet begins with epilepsy. Since the time of

<!-- chunk -->

### Hippocrates, fasting was known to stop seizures and was used as a

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment in many cultures. With the advent of modern medicine, however,

<!-- chunk -->

### this was largely believed to be religious folklore and likely nonsense. That

<!-- chunk -->

### changed in the 1920s when a physician published a research article about

<!-- chunk -->

### fasting stopping seizures in a boy. The problem with fasting is that if it’s

<!-- chunk -->

### done too long, people die of starvation—not a very effective intervention.

<!-- chunk -->

### And when people start eating normally again, the seizures usually come

<!-- chunk -->

### right back. In 1921, Dr. Russell Wilder developed the ketogenic diet, a diet

<!-- chunk -->

### high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates, to address this

<!-- chunk -->

### challenge. His desire was to see if the diet could mimic the fasting state, but

<!-- chunk -->

### prevent starvation, to treat epilepsy. Lo and behold, it worked. The

<!-- chunk -->

### ketogenic diet reduced or stopped seizures in about 85 percent of the people

<!-- chunk -->

### who tried it. By the 1950s, it had fallen out of favor as a growing number of

<!-- chunk -->

### antiepileptic medications came to market. Taking a pill is much easier than

<!-- chunk -->

### doing this diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, about 30 percent of patients with epilepsy don’t improve

<!-- chunk -->

### with any of the pills we have to offer, so the ketogenic diet was resurrected

<!-- chunk -->

### in the 1970s at Johns Hopkins for use in treatment-resistant epilepsy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Clinical use of this diet has grown around the world since. Many clinical

<!-- chunk -->

### trials have shown efficacy, and a 2020 Cochrane Review (a gold-standard

<!-- chunk -->

### meta-analysis) concludes that children with treatment-resistant epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### who eat ketogenic diets are three times more likely to achieve seizure

<!-- chunk -->

### freedom and six times more likely to experience a 50 percent or greater

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in seizures than children getting usual care.


<!-- chunk -->

### The ketogenic diet is now the best-studied dietary intervention for its

<!-- chunk -->

### effects on the brain. Neurologists, neuroscientists, and pharmaceutical

<!-- chunk -->

### companies have been studying this diet for decades trying to better

<!-- chunk -->

### understand its anticonvulsant effects. It provides an alternate fuel source,

<!-- chunk -->

### which can be a lifeline to insulin-resistant brain cells. It also changes

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitter levels, regulates calcium channels, decreases

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, improves the gut microbiome, increases overall metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### rate, reduces insulin resistance itself, and most importantly, induces both

<!-- chunk -->

### mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis.


<!-- chunk -->

### After people are on this diet for

<!-- chunk -->

### months or years, their cells have more healthy mitochondria. This can result

<!-- chunk -->

### in long-term healing. Many people can stop the diet after two to five years

<!-- chunk -->

### and remain well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research for the diet’s efficacy in treating mental health disorders is

<!-- chunk -->

### in the early stages. In my own work, I have seen people with severe,

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment-resistant psychotic disorders achieve full remission of their

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms for long periods of time through a ketogenic diet.


<!-- chunk -->

### You’ll hear

<!-- chunk -->

### about one at the end of this chapter. The effects of the diet in the first year

<!-- chunk -->

### are just like a medication. People need to remain on the diet religiously.

<!-- chunk -->

### They can’t stop it for “cheat days,” just like they can’t stop their

<!-- chunk -->

### medications for cheat days. All hell can break loose if they do. I should

<!-- chunk -->

### point out that it’s common to use epilepsy treatments in psychiatry. We use

<!-- chunk -->

### many of them for almost all types of mental disorders. So, in many ways,

<!-- chunk -->

### this is nothing new. It just happens to be a dietary intervention. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### several clinical trials for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia getting

<!-- chunk -->

### underway currently.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease researchers looked at twenty-six patients who all

<!-- chunk -->

### got twelve weeks of the ketogenic diet and twelve weeks of a low-fat diet,

<!-- chunk -->

### separated by a ten-week washout period.


<!-- chunk -->

### Participants did the diets in

<!-- chunk -->

### different orders and the assessments were blinded. At the end of the study,

<!-- chunk -->

### the researchers found that when people were on the ketogenic diet, they had

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in daily function and quality of life. I should point out that

<!-- chunk -->

### this is one of the few studies to demonstrate improvement in symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### Alzheimer’s disease. Most studies, like the intranasal insulin studies I told

<!-- chunk -->

### you about, only prevent progression of the disease. They don’t reverse it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Obviously, this was a small trial that needs to be replicated in more people

<!-- chunk -->

### over longer periods of time, but the basic science certainly supports why

<!-- chunk -->

### and how this might be working.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many versions of the ketogenic diet, including ones for

<!-- chunk -->

### weight loss, diabetes management, and epilepsy, and they don’t always

<!-- chunk -->

### have the same effects. The foods can also be tailored to personal

<!-- chunk -->

### preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, meat-only (the “carnivore diet”), or

<!-- chunk -->

### a diet with both animal and plant-sourced foods. Those with medical or

<!-- chunk -->

### mental disorders should only do this diet with medical supervision, as there

<!-- chunk -->

### are risks and side effects, and prescription medications usually need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### adjusted or stopped safely.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Gut Microbiome

<!-- chunk -->

### As mentioned, there is no question that the gut microbiome plays a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and metabolic health. In terms of proven interventions, however, this

<!-- chunk -->

### field is in its infancy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are four types of interventions to consider:

<!-- chunk -->

### 1.Avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotic exposure if possible. Antibiotics are known to disrupt the

<!-- chunk -->

### microbiome, and they can sometimes directly cause mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. In addition to not taking antibiotics unless necessary, it’s

<!-- chunk -->

# Success Story: Mildred—It’s Never Too Late!

<!-- chunk -->

### Mildred had a horrible, abusive childhood. There is no doubt that she

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered from symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. At age

<!-- chunk -->

### seventeen,

<!-- chunk -->

### she was also diagnosed with schizophrenia. She began having daily

<!-- chunk -->

### hallucinations and delusions. She became chronically paranoid. Over the

<!-- chunk -->

### ensuing decades, she tried different antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing

<!-- chunk -->

### medications, but her symptoms continued. She could no longer care for

<!-- chunk -->

### herself and was assigned a court-appointed guardian. She was miserable.

<!-- chunk -->

### She tried to kill herself numerous times, once drinking a bottle of cleaning

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid. On top of her mental symptoms, she was obese, weighing

<!-- chunk -->

### pounds.

<!-- chunk -->

### At age seventy, after fifty-three years of being tormented and disabled

<!-- chunk -->

### by her schizophrenia, her doctor encouraged her to go to a weight-loss

<!-- chunk -->

### clinic at Duke University. They were using the ketogenic diet as a weight-

<!-- chunk -->

### loss method. She decided to give it a try. Within two weeks, not only did

<!-- chunk -->

### she begin to lose weight, she noticed significant improvement in her

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic symptoms. She said that for the first time in years, she was able

<!-- chunk -->

### to hear the birds singing outside. The voices in her head were no longer

<!-- chunk -->

### drowning them out. Her mood was also improving, and she began to have

<!-- chunk -->

### hope. She was able to taper off all her psychiatric medications. Her

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms went into full remission. She also lost 150 pounds and has kept it

<!-- chunk -->

### off to this day.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now, thirteen years later, she remains symptom-free, off medication,

<!-- chunk -->

### and doesn’t see any mental health professionals. Having learned to take care

<!-- chunk -->

### of herself, she got rid of the guardian, too. When I last spoke with Mildred,

<!-- chunk -->

### she said she was happy and excited to be alive. She asked me to share her

<!-- chunk -->

### story with anyone and everyone willing to listen. She hopes that her story

<!-- chunk -->

### might help others escape the living hell that she had to endure for decades.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stories like Mildred’s . . . just don’t happen in psychiatry. Even with the

<!-- chunk -->

### best traditional treatments that we have to offer, this is unheard of.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mildred’s story and the theory of brain energy say it is possible. It is a new

<!-- chunk -->

### day in the mental health field, one filled with hope for more stories like

<!-- chunk -->

### Mildred’s.


# Drugs and Alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### t’s well known that drugs and alcohol can lead to mental disorders, and

<!-- chunk -->

### that people with mental disorders are more likely to use drugs and

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol. Think of the young man smoking too much marijuana who ends

<!-- chunk -->

### up with schizophrenia. Or the alcoholic who develops dementia. Or the

<!-- chunk -->

### cocaine addict with bipolar disorder. Most people think these are just the

<!-- chunk -->

### results of toxic drugs on the brain. Or that maybe these people were

<!-- chunk -->

### predisposed to mental illness and the drugs pushed them over the edge.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both assertions are true. But exactly how do they cause mental illness? Up

<!-- chunk -->

### until now, no one could say for sure. The brain energy theory offers clear

<!-- chunk -->

### answers: drugs and alcohol converge on metabolism and mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most drugs fit into one of two categories—they either stimulate or

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibit cells. This includes alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine,

<!-- chunk -->

### amphetamines, and opiates. Some drugs work on specific cells in the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### or body, while others have broader effects on different types of cells. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, alcohol and marijuana, which I’ll focus on soon, both have broad

<!-- chunk -->

### effects

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the body. They act through receptors mostly found on the

<!-- chunk -->

### surfaces of cells, which then impact the mitochondria within those cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, mitochondria also have their own receptors for marijuana,

<!-- chunk -->

### nicotine, alcohol, and Valium right on their membranes. These drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### directly impact mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs and alcohol form a feedback loop with metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. People can enter this feedback loop in different ways, but

<!-- chunk -->

### once they get in, it can be difficult to get out.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some people start using drugs or alcohol due to peer pressure or other

<!-- chunk -->

### social influences. They can be perfectly happy and metabolically healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### when they begin. Using excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol over time,

<!-- chunk -->

### however, impairs metabolism and mitochondrial function. Once impaired,

<!-- chunk -->

### people can get to a point in which they “need” the substances to feel

<!-- chunk -->

### normal. Notice that I used the word “normal” and not “good.” Initially,

<!-- chunk -->

### when people begin using drugs and alcohol, they often feel good. This

<!-- chunk -->

### reinforces the behavior. People like feeling good. But over time, the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### adapts to these substances and tries to counteract them. As the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### changes, people can begin to feel “bad” when they aren’t using the

<!-- chunk -->

### substance. This leads to a vicious cycle in which they now need the

<!-- chunk -->

### substance just to feel normal. They often can’t get the same high that they

<!-- chunk -->

### once got. When they try to go without the substance, they suffer in some

<!-- chunk -->

### way. This usually drives them to use again. And now they are trapped.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other people get into drugs and alcohol because they are already

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically compromised. They already suffer from depression, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### insecurity, psychosis, or something distressing. They are looking to feel

<!-- chunk -->

### better. If their symptoms are bad enough, they will try anything. As a broad

<!-- chunk -->

### overview, if they suffer from symptoms of underactive cells, such as some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the symptoms of depression, taking something that is stimulating will

<!-- chunk -->

### make them feel better. If they suffer from symptoms of overactive or

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitable brain cells, such as anxiety or psychosis, taking something

<!-- chunk -->

### that is sedating and inhibits cell activity can make them feel better. If the

<!-- chunk -->

### substance works well, they can get hooked. In some ways, who can blame

<!-- chunk -->

### them? They just want to feel better. Sometimes, people don’t necessarily

<!-- chunk -->

### feel “better” with substances;

<!-- chunk -->

### they just feel “different”—numb or out of it. For some, this can be

<!-- chunk -->

### preferable to the way they feel otherwise. In any case, this is probably why

<!-- chunk -->

### all mental disorders are associated with higher rates of substance use


<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs and alcohol can have immediate effects on mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### function that can result in symptoms of many psychiatric disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Different drugs can quickly produce hallucinations, delusions, manic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. I can’t review all of this in one chapter, but I’ll share some

<!-- chunk -->

### highlights of how alcohol and marijuana can impact mitochondria.

# Alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### Alcohol has profound effects on metabolism and mitochondria. When

<!-- chunk -->

### consumed in excess, it’s known to be toxic to the liver and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria play a primary role in this toxicity. I’ll walk you through

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the science.

<!-- chunk -->

### When people drink alcohol, the liver does most of the processing. An

<!-- chunk -->

### enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts it into acetaldehyde,

<!-- chunk -->

### a toxic molecule to cells. Another enzyme, cytochrome P450 2E1

<!-- chunk -->

### (CYP2E1), can also make this conversion. CYP2E1 happens to be located

<!-- chunk -->

### directly on mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum. Yet another enzyme,

<!-- chunk -->

### aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), then converts acetaldehyde into a less

<!-- chunk -->

### toxic molecule, acetate. ALDH comes in two forms: one that ends up in the

<!-- chunk -->

### cytoplasm and another that ends up inside mitochondria. Acetate then gets

<!-- chunk -->

### used by mitochondria as a fuel source. As you can see, mitochondria are

<!-- chunk -->

### playing a role in all of this.

<!-- chunk -->

### If people binge drink, these enzyme systems back up, and acetaldehyde

<!-- chunk -->

### levels rise. The first signs of problems are with mitochondria. They swell

<!-- chunk -->

### up, have trouble producing ATP, and create more ROS. Numerous studies

<!-- chunk -->

### have documented mitochondrial impairment, and even destruction, from

<!-- chunk -->

### large doses of alcohol.


<!-- chunk -->

### This is likely the cause of death in alcohol

<!-- chunk -->

### poisoning.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chronic alcohol consumption leads to chronic oxidative stress, a sign of

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial impairment. This leads to inflammation, which only makes

<!-- chunk -->

### the problems worse. All of this is occurring throughout the body, but

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly in the liver and brain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even short periods of heavy alcohol use can have lasting effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers looked at adolescent rats exposed to two weeks of binge

<!-- chunk -->

### drinking and the effects on mitochondria in their brains over time.


<!-- chunk -->

### They

<!-- chunk -->

### found that binge drinking immediately impaired mitochondrial function, not

<!-- chunk -->

### surprising after what I just shared with you. However, the effects in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocampus lasted into adulthood, with reduced levels of mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins, reduced ATP production, and problems managing calcium.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,

<!-- chunk -->

### has been studying the connections between addiction and metabolism for

<!-- chunk -->

### years now and is a pioneer in this field. She and others have discovered

<!-- chunk -->

### some surprising findings in chronic alcoholics. When people drink alcohol,

<!-- chunk -->

### their brains use less glucose as an energy source and instead use acetate

<!-- chunk -->

### from alcohol.


<!-- chunk -->

### Over time, alcoholics develop a problem with brain glucose

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. Their brain cells become energy deprived when they are

<!-- chunk -->

### sober.


<!-- chunk -->

### When they drink alcohol again, acetate fuels these struggling brain

<!-- chunk -->

### cells and provides relief. This brain energy deficit may be one of the

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons that alcoholics have trouble staying away from alcohol. Volkow and

<!-- chunk -->

### others set out to see if they could help these struggling brain cells with

<!-- chunk -->

### something other than alcohol. They turned to the ketogenic diet.

<!-- chunk -->

### They recruited thirty-three people with alcohol use disorder and

<!-- chunk -->

### admitted them to a detox unit.


<!-- chunk -->

### Half of them got a ketogenic diet and the

<!-- chunk -->

### other half got the standard American diet for twelve weeks. The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxed participants using standard protocols and conducted a variety of

<!-- chunk -->

### blood tests and brain scans looking at brain metabolism in targeted regions.

<!-- chunk -->

### They found that people who got the ketogenic diet needed less detox

<!-- chunk -->

### medication and had fewer withdrawal symptoms. They also reported fewer

<!-- chunk -->

### cravings for alcohol. Brain scans showed improved brain metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced levels of brain inflammation compared to those on the standard

<!-- chunk -->

### American diet. This pilot study demonstrated that a dietary intervention,

<!-- chunk -->

### seemingly unrelated to alcoholism, could make a big difference in the

<!-- chunk -->

### brains, and symptoms, of real people. This is how science can change the

<!-- chunk -->

### mental health field.

<!-- chunk -->

### I want to point out one caution. As part of this work, the researchers tested

<!-- chunk -->

### what impact the diet might have on blood alcohol levels if a person were to

<!-- chunk -->

### drink. They tested rats on the ketogenic diet and found that their blood

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol levels increased fivefold compared to rats on a normal diet, even

<!-- chunk -->

### though they all got the same amount of alcohol. This means that if people

<!-- chunk -->

### with alcohol use disorder were to try the ketogenic diet on their own, it

<!-- chunk -->

### could be dangerous if they drink. They could get much more intoxicated

<!-- chunk -->

### than usual. I don’t mean to imply that interventions like this can’t be used,

<!-- chunk -->

### but issues like this need to be considered, and people need to develop a safe

<!-- chunk -->

### way to manage these risks.

# Marijuana

<!-- chunk -->

### Marijuana is increasingly popular. Many people tout it as a “cure-all” for

<!-- chunk -->

### whatever ails you. It is thought to be good for seizures, pain disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD. And yet, it can also cause mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, including learning and memory impairment, a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### motivation, and possibly psychotic disorders.


<!-- chunk -->

### The brain energy theory offers a straightforward way to understand all

<!-- chunk -->

### these observations. They all relate to metabolism and mitochondria. The

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms that improve are due to hyperexcitability. Any substance that

<!-- chunk -->

### reduces mitochondrial function in the correct cells could reduce these

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. However, such a substance could also cause symptoms if it

<!-- chunk -->

### impairs mitochondrial function too much. Is there any evidence that

<!-- chunk -->

### marijuana impacts mitochondria in these ways? Well, by now, you know I

<!-- chunk -->

### wouldn’t ask that question if the answer wasn’t a resounding yes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marijuana affects the endocannabinoid system in the human body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Receptors for cannabinoids are found throughout the body, but they are

<!-- chunk -->

### highly concentrated in the brain. There are primarily two types of receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### —CB1 and CB2. These are located on cell membranes, but CB1 receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### are also located directly on mitochondria. Because there are different types

<!-- chunk -->

### of receptors located on a wide variety of cells throughout

<!-- chunk -->

### the body, it’s not fair to say there is one universal effect on all cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, the predominant theme in neurons is that marijuana slows the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of mitochondria through CB1 receptors.


<!-- chunk -->

### Brain imaging studies of

<!-- chunk -->

### almost eight hundred adolescents, some who used marijuana and others

<!-- chunk -->

### who didn’t, showed that the regions of the brain highest in CB1 receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### showed “accelerated age-related cortical thinning” in the marijuana users,

<!-- chunk -->

### meaning that marijuana’s effects on these mitochondrial receptors was

<!-- chunk -->

### likely the cause of these brain areas getting thinner.


<!-- chunk -->

### A mouse study published in Nature found that mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### astrocytes have a direct role in mediating the effects of marijuana—they

<!-- chunk -->

### control the amount of glucose and lactate (energy sources) going to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons.


<!-- chunk -->

### This, in turn, has direct effects on social behaviors. All of this is

<!-- chunk -->

### mediated through the CB1 receptors on mitochondria. When these receptors

<!-- chunk -->

### were activated by THC (the active ingredient in marijuana), it led to a

<!-- chunk -->

### reduction in both mitochondrial function and energy sources going to

<!-- chunk -->

### neurons. It also led to social withdrawal behaviors. When the researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### removed mitochondrial CB1 receptors, THC no longer had the same effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### The mitochondria weren’t impacted in the same ways; the energy sources

<!-- chunk -->

### going to neurons weren’t reduced; and the social withdrawal behaviors

<!-- chunk -->

### didn’t occur, even though the mice were still being exposed to marijuana,

<!-- chunk -->

### and CB2 receptors were available on cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another study from Nature tried to determine what causes the memory

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment from marijuana use. The researchers were ultimately hoping to

<!-- chunk -->

### better understand how memory works. The CB1 receptors on mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### again play a key role. The researchers found that marijuana’s effect on CB1

<!-- chunk -->

### receptors directly impacted mitochondrial movement, synapse function, and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation. When they deleted the CB1 receptors, marijuana no

<!-- chunk -->

### longer had any of these effects, and memory wasn’t impaired. These

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers concluded: “By directly linking mitochondrial activity to

<!-- chunk -->

### memory formation, these data reveal that bioenergetic processes are

<!-- chunk -->

### primary acute regulators of cognitive functions.”


<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, brain

<!-- chunk -->

### energy and mitochondria play a primary role in our ability to remember.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many other addictive substances that impact metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, but I hope these two examples give you an idea of how

<!-- chunk -->

### substance use fits into the theory of brain energy.

# Drug and Alcohol Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Drug and alcohol treatment programs play a powerful role in improving

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and metabolic health. Reducing or stopping the use of substances

<!-- chunk -->

### that impair mitochondrial function is critically important.

<!-- chunk -->

### Entire books are written on this topic. I won’t try to review their

<!-- chunk -->

### conclusions here. Numerous strategies are available, including inpatient

<!-- chunk -->

### detox, residential programs, outpatient therapy, group therapy, medication-

<!-- chunk -->

### assisted treatments, twelve-step programs, and halfway houses.

<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, a new area of research is on the use of psychedelics as a

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment for some psychiatric disorders. I’ll get to that in Chapter 18.


<!-- chunk -->

### •Drugs and alcohol affect your metabolism and mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Withdrawing from them can also impact metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria in different ways.

<!-- chunk -->

### •It’s important to assess your use of substances, including tobacco,

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol, caffeine, supplements, marijuana, and recreational drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### These might be playing a role in your metabolic and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### •If you are using any of these heavily, it could be an important

<!-- chunk -->

### contributing cause to any metabolic or mental symptoms you are

<!-- chunk -->

### having. You will likely need to address this before trying other

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions. If you have trouble doing this on your own, consider

<!-- chunk -->

### seeking professional help.

# E


# Physical Activity

<!-- chunk -->

### xercise is good for health. Many studies show that people who

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise are less likely to develop metabolic disorders, such as obesity,

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This is one reason that exercise is

<!-- chunk -->

### so strongly recommended.

<!-- chunk -->

### The same is true in relation to mental health. A study of 1.2 million

<!-- chunk -->

### Americans found that those who exercised had 43 percent fewer days of

<!-- chunk -->

### poor mental health, even after controlling for physical and

<!-- chunk -->

### sociodemographic characteristics.


<!-- chunk -->

### This study found that any type of

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise was better than no exercise, but that the largest benefits were seen

<!-- chunk -->

### for team sports, cycling, and aerobic and gym activities. The optimal “dose”

<!-- chunk -->

### was forty-five minutes, three to five times per week.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people stop there. That’s enough information to make a

<!-- chunk -->

### recommendation. If someone exercises for forty-five minutes, three to five

<!-- chunk -->

### times per week, that should solve the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### I truly wish it was that simple, but it’s not. I’ve seen many patients who

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise regularly and still have crippling schizophrenia or depression. I

<!-- chunk -->

### want to explore the nuances of being active. Giving simple explanations

<!-- chunk -->

### with simple answers isn’t going to address our mental health problems. If

<!-- chunk -->

### people follow the “forty-five minutes three to five times a week” advice and

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t see results, they give up in frustration and disappointment. Don’t

<!-- chunk -->

### worry if you’re an exercise advocate—I’m still going to recommend

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise in the end.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first thing to highlight was that the study with 1.2 million people

<!-- chunk -->

### was a correlational study. As you know by now, correlation doesn’t equal

<!-- chunk -->

### causation. It’s possible that people who exercise already have good mental

<!-- chunk -->

### and metabolic health, and that allows them to exercise. This would be

<!-- chunk -->

### reverse causation.

<!-- chunk -->

### To illustrate how complicated this can all be, I’ll tell you about another

<!-- chunk -->

### study. This one followed 1,700 women at midlife for twenty years to see if

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise prevents cognitive decline.


<!-- chunk -->

### Most people would assume it does.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, menopause

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms, hormone therapy use, and presence of diabetes and

<!-- chunk -->

### hypertension, they found that exercise didn’t make any difference in

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive symptoms. They concluded that “physical activity observed in

<!-- chunk -->

### later life may be an artifact of reverse causation.” So, the news headline for

<!-- chunk -->

### this study is that exercise doesn’t prevent cognitive decline. But this isn’t so

<!-- chunk -->

### clear-cut. They “controlled” for diabetes and hypertension, as though

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise is independent of these variables. We know that it’s not! Exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### decreases the likelihood of both, and may thereby decrease the risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### cognitive decline, too. We know they are all interrelated. And yet, some

<!-- chunk -->

### researchers and academic journals assume they aren’t.

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise has been studied as a treatment for mental disorders, with

<!-- chunk -->

### depression being the most studied illness. The results are mixed, with some

<!-- chunk -->

### studies showing benefits and others not. A 2017 meta-analysis looking at

<!-- chunk -->

### exercise as a treatment for major depression included thirty-five studies

<!-- chunk -->

### with almost 2,500 participants.


<!-- chunk -->

### Their conclusion: “Trials with less risk of

<!-- chunk -->

### bias suggested no antidepressant effects of exercise and there were no

<!-- chunk -->

### significant

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of exercise on quality of life, depression severity or lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### remission during follow-up.” That’s disappointing!

<!-- chunk -->

### And yet the World Health Organization begs to differ. They issued a

<!-- chunk -->

### report in 2019 entitled Motion for Your Mind. They summarized their

<!-- chunk -->

### findings as follows: “A review of the evidence for the benefits of physical

<!-- chunk -->

### activity for people with depression, schizophrenia and dementia indicated

<!-- chunk -->

### improved mood, slowed cognitive decline, and delayed disease onset . . . ”


<!-- chunk -->

### So, what are we supposed to believe? Does exercise help or not? It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### tempting to err on the “safe” side and tell everyone to exercise, but if it

<!-- chunk -->

### doesn’t actually work, that just sets people up for failure and makes the

<!-- chunk -->

### person recommending it seem less credible.

<!-- chunk -->

### In otherwise healthy people, it’s known that exercise can improve

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic health. It’s known to induce both mitochondrial biogenesis and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitophagy—the two things we are looking to do. This occurs not only in

<!-- chunk -->

### muscle cells but also in brain cells. Increasing mitochondria in brain cells

<!-- chunk -->

### should be helpful. So why don’t treatment studies consistently show a

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit?

<!-- chunk -->

### One reason may be insulin resistance. A study published in Cell found

<!-- chunk -->

### that it may block the benefits of exercise. Researchers had thirty-six people

<!-- chunk -->

### with varying levels of insulin resistance exercise and measured a plethora of

<!-- chunk -->

### biological measures before and after. They found that there were significant

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### repair, and growth factor responses, with most of these beneficial processes

<!-- chunk -->

### being dampened or even reversed in those with insulin resistance.


<!-- chunk -->

### As I’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### already discussed, many people with chronic mental disorders have insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance, so this may explain at the cellular level why exercise might be

<!-- chunk -->

### harder for them and why it might not work.

<!-- chunk -->

### I suspect that the more important issue is that many people are taking

<!-- chunk -->

### substances and/or have lifestyle factors that impair mitochondrial function,

<!-- chunk -->

### and these are interfering with the beneficial effects of exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Athletes, trainers, and coaches have long known that it takes more than

<!-- chunk -->

### just exercise itself to improve performance. All the factors that I discuss in

<!-- chunk -->

### this book play a role. If someone wants to improve their physical

<!-- chunk -->

### performance through exercise, they also need to pay attention to eating a

<!-- chunk -->

### proper diet, getting good sleep, and refraining from alcohol and drug use,

<!-- chunk -->

### among other things. For example, as I already discussed, alcohol can

<!-- chunk -->

### damage mitochondria and prevent mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is why we’ve all heard the advice that if you’re training for an

<!-- chunk -->

### important athletic event, or even if you just want to lose weight, you need to

<!-- chunk -->

### stop drinking. Improving metabolism involves many lifestyle factors in

<!-- chunk -->

### combination, not just one.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medications can also play an adverse role. In theory, any medication

<!-- chunk -->

### that impairs mitochondrial function might prevent exercise from working.

<!-- chunk -->

### One study looked directly at this issue for the commonly prescribed

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes medication metformin. Researchers had fifty-three older adults

<!-- chunk -->

### participate in twelve weeks of aerobic training and assigned half of them to

<!-- chunk -->

### take metformin and the other half a placebo. Both groups experienced some

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits from the exercise, such as a reduction in fat mass, glucose, and

<!-- chunk -->

### insulin levels. However, improvements in muscle mitochondrial function

<!-- chunk -->

### were abrogated in the people taking metformin. The metformin group had

<!-- chunk -->

### no overall change in whole-body insulin sensitivity, even though the

<!-- chunk -->

### placebo group experienced improvement. These researchers summarized

<!-- chunk -->

### their findings in the title of their study: “Metformin Inhibits Mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### Adaptations to Aerobic Exercise Training in Older Adults.”


<!-- chunk -->

### So, in all the

<!-- chunk -->

### studies looking at the effects of exercise for weight loss, diabetes, or mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, we would need to know if any of those participants were taking

<!-- chunk -->

### metformin. If they were, they were likely being set up for failure to improve

<!-- chunk -->

### their mitochondrial function, and this might be the reason some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### studies showed no benefit.

<!-- chunk -->

### Metformin is one of the “mildest” diabetes medications with the fewest

<!-- chunk -->

### side effects. Many other diabetes medications, including insulin itself, cause

<!-- chunk -->

### weight gain and even more insulin resistance over time. But it’s not limited

<!-- chunk -->

### to diabetes medications. As you now know, some psychiatric medications,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially the antipsychotic medications, are known to cause serious

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial dysfunction. People taking any of

<!-- chunk -->

### these medications will likely fail to get the full benefits of exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### The research on exercise for mental illness didn’t factor any of this into

<!-- chunk -->

### their studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mitochondria play a direct role in translating exercise into beneficial

<!-- chunk -->

### effects in the brain. When people exercise, one of the benefits is that they

<!-- chunk -->

### usually develop new neurons in the hippocampus from stem cells. This

<!-- chunk -->

### process has been found to be directly related to both mood and cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. The growth of these stem cells into new neurons depends upon

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria. When researchers genetically manipulated mitochondria to

<!-- chunk -->

### inhibit or enhance their function, the development of these new neurons

<!-- chunk -->

### was inhibited or enhanced, respectively.


<!-- chunk -->

### Based on this research, it appears

<!-- chunk -->

### likely that if someone has poor mitochondrial function in this brain region,

<!-- chunk -->

### they may not get the same benefits from exercise that other people get.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if we can restore their mitochondrial health, it’s possible that we

<!-- chunk -->

### can change this.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a rule of thumb, exercise can do one of two things: It can help

<!-- chunk -->

### people maintain their current abilities, or it can improve their abilities. This

<!-- chunk -->

### translates into maintaining your current metabolic status or improving it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking a leisurely walk around the block helps people maintain their

<!-- chunk -->

### current metabolic status. This is useful. It’s certainly better than losing

<!-- chunk -->

### strength or ability. However, to improve metabolic capacity, people need to

<!-- chunk -->

### push themselves. They must work toward getting faster, stronger, more

<!-- chunk -->

### flexible, doing more reps, or achieving some other metric of increased

<!-- chunk -->

### capacity. We know that when this happens, the number of mitochondria in

<!-- chunk -->

### their muscle and brain cells increase, and the health of those mitochondria

<!-- chunk -->

### improve as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the challenges with exercise is that asking people who are

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolically compromised to push themselves involves risk. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### risks of injury and even heart attacks. Therefore, exercise needs to be

<!-- chunk -->

### managed in a safe way. Physical therapists, personal trainers, and others

<!-- chunk -->

### will play an essential role for some people.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bigger challenge is getting people who are metabolically

<!-- chunk -->

### compromised to follow through with an exercise routine. They lack energy

<!-- chunk -->

### and motivation. Their metabolism is doing this to them. It’s not their fault.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overcoming this inertia can be difficult. Nonetheless, it can be done with

<!-- chunk -->

### support, encouragement, and education.

# Exercise as a Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### Should everyone exercise? I would say yes. But it’s important to keep in

<!-- chunk -->

### mind that it will be much harder for people with chronic mental disorders,

<!-- chunk -->

### and they may not notice benefits right away. It’s also important to take an

<!-- chunk -->

### inventory of all the factors that might be impairing your mitochondria and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism; reducing or eliminating these will allow exercise to work.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nonetheless, exercise won’t be the answer for everyone. As I’ve been

<!-- chunk -->

### discussing, there are many factors that play a role in metabolic and mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health. Exercise is only one of them. For people with vitamin or hormone

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiencies, for example, exercise isn’t going to solve the problem, but it

<!-- chunk -->

### certainly won’t hurt.


<!-- chunk -->

### •Exercise can play a role in preventing mental and metabolic


<!-- chunk -->

### •Exercise may be more difficult if you have insulin resistance or any

<!-- chunk -->

### condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. It may take

<!-- chunk -->

### longer to show benefits. This doesn’t mean it won’t work; it just

<!-- chunk -->

### means that you should try to be patient and not expect immediate

<!-- chunk -->

### results.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Identifying, removing, and/or reducing substances and lifestyle

<!-- chunk -->

### factors that impair mitochondrial function will be required to realize

<!-- chunk -->

### the full benefits of exercise. These can sometimes negate the benefits

<!-- chunk -->

### of exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

### •

<!-- chunk -->

### Exercise can be an effective treatment for some people with mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, but for others, it may not be the solution.

<!-- chunk -->

### •People with injuries or physical limitations should work with their

<!-- chunk -->

### healthcare provider to implement an exercise program safely. This

<!-- chunk -->

### may include working with a physical therapist.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Even if exercise doesn’t improve your mental symptoms, you should

<!-- chunk -->

### still exercise, as it offers numerous other health benefits. Humans are

<!-- chunk -->

### meant to move.

# M


# Love, Adversity, and Purpose in Life

<!-- chunk -->

### etabolic and mental health require a combination of both biological

<!-- chunk -->

### and environmental factors. I’ve told you about many of the

<!-- chunk -->

### biological factors. The environment includes many things—food,

<!-- chunk -->

### shelter, temperature, light, infections, allergens, and lifestyle choices—

<!-- chunk -->

### some of which we’ve covered. But it also includes people, experiences,

<!-- chunk -->

### love, and purpose in life. Although most people see these latter constructs

<!-- chunk -->

### as psychological and social issues and often assume they aren’t related to

<!-- chunk -->

### biology, they actually play profound roles in metabolism. They are all

<!-- chunk -->

### interrelated and inseparable. We adapt and respond to our environments, for

<!-- chunk -->

### better or worse.

# Use It or Lose It

<!-- chunk -->

### The phrase “use it or lose it” is usually associated with exercise and muscle

<!-- chunk -->

### strength. When people use, or stress, certain muscles, they become larger

<!-- chunk -->

### and more resilient. Not only do they grow in size, but they also develop

<!-- chunk -->

### more mitochondria. This is true even when the size of the muscles isn’t that

<!-- chunk -->

### much larger. For example, some long-distance runners can be very thin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their muscles aren’t all that big, yet they contain more mitochondria than

<!-- chunk -->

### the muscles of people who don’t run. These mitochondria give their

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles the endurance they need to go long distances.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not using muscles results in atrophy, or shrinking. This can be striking

<!-- chunk -->

### when people break a bone and are in a cast for several weeks. Their muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### shrink rapidly. Why? When the body isn’t using something, it diverts

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic resources from it. The body is always adapting and adjusting. It

<!-- chunk -->

### spends its energy wisely. If muscles aren’t being used, they don’t get much

<!-- chunk -->

### glucose or as many amino acids. They quickly shrink. The good news is

<!-- chunk -->

### that the body keeps a memory of what those muscles once were. Once the

<!-- chunk -->

### cast comes off, the muscles quickly return to their normal size if they get

<!-- chunk -->

### used in the same ways again. This truly depends on what size they were

<!-- chunk -->

### beforehand. Big bodybuilders will quickly regain their massive muscles,

<!-- chunk -->

### while frail, elderly people will only get a tiny amount of muscle growth.

<!-- chunk -->

### This concept of “use it or lose it” applies to more than just muscles. It

<!-- chunk -->

### also applies to the brain. The best evidence for this comes from studies of

<!-- chunk -->

### children as their brains are developing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some human skills and traits need to be acquired at the right times. The

<!-- chunk -->

### brain undergoes “developmental windows” during which it is ready to learn

<!-- chunk -->

### and adapt. However, the “environment” must offer experiences needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### acquire these skills or else they can be altered for life. Social skills are one

<!-- chunk -->

### example.

<!-- chunk -->

### Social skills are important to human survival. They allow us to live in

<!-- chunk -->

### families, towns, and societies. They require two things to develop properly:

<!-- chunk -->

### (1) normal brain development to acquire and store the information and (2)

<!-- chunk -->

### learning experiences from other humans. If either is absent, problems will

<!-- chunk -->

### be

<!-- chunk -->

### obvious. The biology side can be understood in terms of brain development,

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, and metabolism, as I have already discussed. The

<!-- chunk -->

### environment side depends upon parents and caretakers primarily. There is a

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendous amount of literature looking at the effects of attachment,

<!-- chunk -->

### neglect, abuse, and social deprivation on human development. Many of us

<!-- chunk -->

### would say these things relate to love, or a lack thereof. They play a

<!-- chunk -->

### profound role in human development, including the acquisition of social

<!-- chunk -->

### skills. Children deprived of appropriate learning opportunities often lack the

<!-- chunk -->

### skills needed to navigate the world effectively. In extreme cases, the

<!-- chunk -->

### consequences can be catastrophic.

<!-- chunk -->

### The findings of researchers studying Romanian orphans exemplifies

<!-- chunk -->

### how tragic this can be. The orphanages where these children were housed

<!-- chunk -->

### were profoundly neglectful, and the children who experienced this neglect

<!-- chunk -->

### were found to suffer from a range of diagnostic categories including autism,

<!-- chunk -->

### learning disorders, mental retardation, PTSD, anxiety disorders, impulse

<!-- chunk -->

### control disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders, and even psychotic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. Once again, numerous diagnostic categories, not just one. Their

<!-- chunk -->

### brains were deprived of the appropriate opportunities to learn how to be

<!-- chunk -->

### “human” in society and the consequences were sometimes devastating. The

<!-- chunk -->

### malnutrition, stress, and trauma they experienced undoubtedly also played

<!-- chunk -->

### roles, but so did the lack of appropriate learning experiences.

<!-- chunk -->

### These children’s brains didn’t develop normally. If areas of the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### that perform certain functions aren’t being used, they don’t grow and thrive.

<!-- chunk -->

### One research group studied metabolic brain scans of ten such children and

<!-- chunk -->

### compared them to normal control and even epileptic children.


<!-- chunk -->

### Sure

<!-- chunk -->

### enough, they found widespread areas of reduced brain glucose metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### indicating a brain energy problem in these former Romanian orphans.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes, these deficits can be corrected later in life; but in some cases,

<!-- chunk -->

### they appear to be permanent. Developmental windows can close, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### opportunity for normal brain development can be lost forever.

<!-- chunk -->

### It’s not always so extreme. For example, children exposed to more

<!-- chunk -->

### screen time are more likely to develop ADHD. There are two ways to

<!-- chunk -->

### interpret this observation. One explanation is that the environment is

<!-- chunk -->

### driving the subsequent diagnosis of ADHD. These children are learning that

<!-- chunk -->

### constant stimulation is the norm given the content on the screens. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### not learning patience, focus, and concentration even if their brains are ready

<!-- chunk -->

### to learn. These developing brain networks will receive fewer metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### resources since they aren’t being used, much like the unused muscle. They

<!-- chunk -->

### may not develop normally, or they may not be as strong and robust as they

<!-- chunk -->

### could otherwise be. This can result in ADHD symptoms. However, it’s also

<!-- chunk -->

### possible that this could be due to reverse causation, and biology might be

<!-- chunk -->

### the problem. If these children have inadequate metabolism in specific brain

<!-- chunk -->

### regions, they may be unable to focus. This may drive them to use screens as

<!-- chunk -->

### a source of entertainment. If this explanation is correct, then correcting the

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic issue will be the first step in solving the problem.

<!-- chunk -->

### The concept of strengthening brain regions is obvious to most of us

<!-- chunk -->

### through clichés like “practice makes perfect.” This applies to learning a

<!-- chunk -->

### new language, playing basketball, or learning to play the piano. When we

<!-- chunk -->

### use our brains in specific ways, neurons grow, adapt, and form new

<!-- chunk -->

### connections. If we use them, they grow. If we don’t, they wither. This all

<!-- chunk -->

### relates to metabolism and mitochondria. They adapt to our needs.

# Stress

<!-- chunk -->

### I now return to stress. I have discussed this throughout the book and have

<!-- chunk -->

### already told you how it plays a powerful role in mental and metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### health. I’ll review some highlights, share some new information, and then

<!-- chunk -->

### get to treatments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recall that the stress response requires energy and metabolic resources.

<!-- chunk -->

### These resources are being diverted from other cells throughout the brain

<!-- chunk -->

### and body, and these other cells can suffer. For example, if a young boy is

<!-- chunk -->

### chronically stressed, he will have more difficulty learning in school. It’s not

<!-- chunk -->

### necessarily because he isn’t trying. The stress response is taking energy that

<!-- chunk -->

### could otherwise be used for brain functions like focus, learning, and

<!-- chunk -->

### memory.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress puts cellular maintenance functions on hold. If it occurs for a

<!-- chunk -->

### prolonged period, it can result in maintenance problems in cells, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### ones not being used much, which can lead to symptoms of mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders. Any cells that are already metabolically compromised

<!-- chunk -->

### can begin to malfunction under stress, which can exacerbate symptoms of

<!-- chunk -->

### mental and metabolic disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Part Two, I talked about how mitochondria play a critical role in the

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response. They influence all aspects of the stress response, including

<!-- chunk -->

### the production and regulation of key hormones and neurotransmitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system responses, inflammation, and epigenetic changes. When

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria are not functioning properly, all of these can be affected.

<!-- chunk -->

### One research study demonstrated a direct relationship between everyday

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and changes in mitochondrial function in humans.


<!-- chunk -->

### The researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### developed a test of mitochondrial health that includes both the quantity and

<!-- chunk -->

### function of mitochondria within white blood cells and assessed whether this

<!-- chunk -->

### metric was associated with daily stress. They studied ninety-one mothers,

<!-- chunk -->

### some who had children with autism and others who had neurotypical

<!-- chunk -->

### children, and assessed their daily mood and stress levels to see if these were

<!-- chunk -->

### related to the mitochondrial health index (MHI). They found that they were.

<!-- chunk -->

### Overall, the mothers who had high levels of stress and low moods had

<!-- chunk -->

### lower MHI. But of course, stress levels and moods can change on a daily

<!-- chunk -->

### basis. The researchers looked at this specifically. When the mothers were in

<!-- chunk -->

### a positive mood, the MHI went up afterward, sometimes within one day. In

<!-- chunk -->

### other words, the health and function of mitochondria in white blood cells

<!-- chunk -->

### were changing in response to the mothers’ daily moods and stress levels.

<!-- chunk -->

### This research demonstrates how stress can lead to impairment in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function, which can then affect overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

### All humans experience stressful life events. In the 1960s, Dr. Thomas

<!-- chunk -->

### Holmes and Dr. Richard Rahe, both psychiatrists, studied five thousand

<!-- chunk -->

### medical patients to see how stressful life events can contribute to physical

<!-- chunk -->

### illness. They identified some common life events and ranked them by how

<!-- chunk -->

### much they impacted overall health. The Holmes-Rahe Stress Inventory is

<!-- chunk -->

### still available today and can give you a sense of what life events are most

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful. Some top ones include the death of a spouse or close family

<!-- chunk -->

### member, divorce, personal injury, getting fired, and even retiring. These

<!-- chunk -->

### select

<!-- chunk -->

### ones involve some type of loss—losing someone important to you, losing

<!-- chunk -->

### your health, or losing your job (even voluntarily). What makes these so

<!-- chunk -->

### stressful? There are many reasons, and they can be different for different

<!-- chunk -->

### stressors, but one common theme is that they all relate to purpose in life.

# Purpose in Life

<!-- chunk -->

### Humans are driven to have a sense of purpose. I believe this is hardwired

<!-- chunk -->

### into our brains, given that this single construct has been highly associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with both metabolic and mental health. When people lack a sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### purpose, it appears to induce a chronic stress response and can lead to many

<!-- chunk -->

### poor health outcomes. Purpose in life is multifaceted, however. It usually

<!-- chunk -->

### includes many things, not just one. The stress inventory that I just

<!-- chunk -->

### mentioned highlights three possibilities: relationships, taking care of

<!-- chunk -->

### yourself and staying healthy, and having a job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Viktor Frankl, an Austrian psychiatrist who was taken prisoner by

<!-- chunk -->

### the Nazis during World War II, deserves credit for highlighting the powerful

<!-- chunk -->

### role of meaning and purpose in life. In his book Man’s Search for Meaning,

<!-- chunk -->

### he described his observations of the other prisoners in the concentration

<!-- chunk -->

### camp. Most became severely depressed, for obvious reasons. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### some did not. Some of the prisoners appeared to hold on to hope that they

<!-- chunk -->

### might live and escape. Frankl argued that the common denominator among

<!-- chunk -->

### them was that they all had a sense of purpose in life: they had a reason to

<!-- chunk -->

### fight and try to stay alive.


<!-- chunk -->

### Frankl went on to develop a psychotherapy,

<!-- chunk -->

### logotherapy, based on the construct of meaning and purpose in life. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### of its tenets are still embedded in current mainstream psychotherapies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The concept of purpose in life continues to be studied today and has

<!-- chunk -->

### been highly correlated with a wide range of metabolic and mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### outcomes. It’s not surprising that a low sense of purpose in life is associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with depression, given that depression itself might make people feel this

<!-- chunk -->

### way. It may just be circular logic. However, a lack of purpose is also

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with metabolic disorders and even longevity, consistent with the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy

<!-- chunk -->

### theory. For example, one study of nearly seven thousand US adults ages

<!-- chunk -->

### fifty-one to sixty-one found that those who had the lowest sense of purpose

<!-- chunk -->

### in life were about 2.5 times more likely to die an early death than those with

<!-- chunk -->

### a strong sense of purpose in life.


<!-- chunk -->

### They were dying of heart attacks, strokes,

<!-- chunk -->

### respiratory disorders, and gastrointestinal conditions. These researchers

<!-- chunk -->

### noted other studies showing that a strong sense of purpose leads to lower

<!-- chunk -->

### levels of cortisol and inflammation, which might explain these health

<!-- chunk -->

### benefits. A 2016 meta-analysis of ten prospective studies that included over

<!-- chunk -->

### 136,000 participants also found that having a higher sense of purpose in life

<!-- chunk -->

### was associated with reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.


<!-- chunk -->

### When discussing purpose in life, it’s important to include spirituality

<!-- chunk -->

### and religious beliefs. For many, these play a powerful role in how they

<!-- chunk -->

### understand their existence. Researchers have studied the effects of religious

<!-- chunk -->

### beliefs and practices on a variety of health outcomes and, in general, have

<!-- chunk -->

### found many beneficial effects. For example, one study looking at adults at

<!-- chunk -->

### high risk for depression found that those who reported religion or

<!-- chunk -->

### spirituality to be highly important were 90 percent less likely to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### depression compared to those who reported them of low importance.


<!-- chunk -->

### researchers conducted brain scans on these people and found differences in

<!-- chunk -->

### the thickness of certain brain regions based on how important religion and

<!-- chunk -->

### spirituality were to the participants. These brain differences may explain the

<!-- chunk -->

### protection against depression. The Nurses’ Health Study followed almost

<!-- chunk -->

### ninety thousand women for more than fourteen years and found that women

<!-- chunk -->

### who attended religious services at least once per week were five times less

<!-- chunk -->

### likely to commit suicide than those who never attended religious services.


<!-- chunk -->

### A systematic review of religious beliefs and practices and their effects on

<!-- chunk -->

### health found a beneficial relationship with several other health outcomes,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as decreased rates of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.


<!-- chunk -->

### One challenge with this type of data, however, is the possibility of reverse

<!-- chunk -->

### causation again—it might be that people who are already healthy are able to

<!-- chunk -->

### attend religious services and connect with people there, but people who are

<!-- chunk -->

### already depressed or metabolically compromised aren’t. Despite this

<!-- chunk -->

### possibility, I’ll soon share with you data that suggests some religious

<!-- chunk -->

### practices,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as meditation and ritual prayers, might directly help improve

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondrial health, so these may, in fact, play a causal

<!-- chunk -->

### role in improving health outcomes.

<!-- chunk -->

### For those who don’t believe in God, I don’t mean to imply that you

<!-- chunk -->

### need to start believing in God to improve your health. I share this

<!-- chunk -->

### information because it relates to purpose in life and has been found to

<!-- chunk -->

### influence both metabolic and mental health. There are other ways to find

<!-- chunk -->

### purpose that can play just as powerful a role.

# Addressing Love, Adversity, and Purpose with

# Treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### All of this can play a role in treatment. First, it’s important to point out a

<!-- chunk -->

### general rule of thumb for human health—people need to develop and

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain full lives, ones that include what I call the four Rs: close

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, meaningful roles in which they contribute to society in some

<!-- chunk -->

### way, adherence to responsibilities and obligations (not just to the people in

<!-- chunk -->

### one’s life, but to society as a whole, such as not breaking laws), and having

<!-- chunk -->

### adequate resources (money, food, shelter, etc.).

<!-- chunk -->

### Many societal factors can interfere with people’s abilities to achieve all

<!-- chunk -->

### of this, including war, trauma, poverty, malnutrition, neglect, racism,

<!-- chunk -->

### homophobia, misogyny, all the ACEs, and so many others. Efforts are

<!-- chunk -->

### needed to address these social problems, for as long as these continue,

<!-- chunk -->

### mental illness will continue to exist. However, people who have been

<!-- chunk -->

### affected by these barriers and atrocities can still recover. They can use

<!-- chunk -->

### science-based approaches to understanding and addressing the impact of

<!-- chunk -->

### these experiences on their metabolism and mitochondria. I’m hopeful this

<!-- chunk -->

### book and the theory of brain energy will help at least some of them.

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychotherapy

<!-- chunk -->

### Addressing the myriad of psychological and social factors that can impact

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism is an important part of treatment. Friends, family, coworkers,

<!-- chunk -->

### teachers, mentors, or people in the community can often help. Some people,

<!-- chunk -->

### however, will need professional help in the form of psychotherapy.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are countless books and academic articles on how psychotherapy

<!-- chunk -->

### can improve mental health. I won’t even try to review all the research.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead, I’ll share just a few of the benefits and some possible reasons why

<!-- chunk -->

### it works:

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can help people resolve conflicts with other people

<!-- chunk -->

### and with their roles in life. When people are unable to do this on their

<!-- chunk -->

### own, it increases stress, which takes a toll on metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can offer specific skills and strategies to reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### stress and cope with symptoms, which can improve metabolism

<!-- chunk -->

### broadly.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can help people change behaviors. Cognitive

<!-- chunk -->

### behavioral therapists have long known that changing behaviors can

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes result in changes in thoughts and feelings. Clinicians

<!-- chunk -->

### treating eating disorders or substance use disorders are often focused

<!-- chunk -->

### on changing behaviors. Addressing behaviors to enhance sleep can

<!-- chunk -->

### produce benefits. As I’ve discussed, all these behaviors play a direct

<!-- chunk -->

### role in metabolism and mitochondrial function.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can help people understand who they are and what

<!-- chunk -->

### they want from life. This can help some people develop a sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### meaning and purpose, which impacts both mental and metabolic


<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can provide new learning to overcome maladaptive

<!-- chunk -->

### beliefs, behaviors, and responses. For example, when people are

<!-- chunk -->

### traumatized, they can sometimes overgeneralize the danger of things

<!-- chunk -->

### that they remember from that experience. Someone who associates

<!-- chunk -->

### certain music, clothes, or cologne with their abuser might be

<!-- chunk -->

### triggered by these everyday experiences. If the abuser is no longer a

<!-- chunk -->

### threat, this is not adaptive or helpful, even though it is

<!-- chunk -->

### understandable. One type of therapy, prolonged exposure, can

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce the stress response to these triggers, which can improve

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic health.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can “exercise” underused brain circuits. Remember

<!-- chunk -->

### “use it or lose it”? If a brain region is underdeveloped, some types of

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapy can help. Treatments that focus on empathy,

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, social skills, or improving cognitive abilities can all

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthen brain circuits that have been underdeveloped. This

<!-- chunk -->

### assumes that these brain regions are metabolically healthy enough to

<!-- chunk -->

### learn and store new information. In some cases, they may not be. In

<!-- chunk -->

### these situations, a different metabolic intervention might be needed

<!-- chunk -->

### first. Once brain health is restored, however, “exercising” and

<!-- chunk -->

### restoring health to these brain regions will still be needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can simply offer a relationship with a compassionate

<!-- chunk -->

### and helpful human being. It has long been known that the

<!-- chunk -->

### “therapeutic alliance,” or a good relationship between the therapist

<!-- chunk -->

### and client, plays a role in psychotherapy outcomes. We come back to

<!-- chunk -->

### one of the realities of human existence: We all need other people. We

<!-- chunk -->

### need relationships in which we can express ourselves and be

<!-- chunk -->

### ourselves. Without them, metabolic health can become compromised

<!-- chunk -->

### due to a chronic stress response. For those who don’t have

<!-- chunk -->

### meaningful relationships, psychotherapy can provide one. Obviously,

<!-- chunk -->

### a goal should be to help these people develop sustaining relationships

<!-- chunk -->

### outside of therapy. However, this can take time. For some people,

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of their brain dysfunction can make it difficult to achieve.

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychedelic Therapy

<!-- chunk -->

### One emerging treatment related to all of this is the use of psychedelic drugs

<!-- chunk -->

### in psychiatry. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin or “magic mushrooms,”

<!-- chunk -->

### are receiving increasing attention as a possible treatment for depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### PTSD, and other conditions, with small pilot trials showing benefits. One

<!-- chunk -->

### research group explored how and why these work. They noted,

<!-- chunk -->

### “psychedelics can reliably and robustly induce intense, profound, and

<!-- chunk -->

### personally meaningful

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences that have been referred to as ‘mystical-type’, ‘spiritual’,

<!-- chunk -->

### ‘religious’, ‘existential’, ‘transformative’, ‘pivotal’ or ‘peak’.”


<!-- chunk -->

### They

<!-- chunk -->

### surveyed 866 users of psychedelics over time and found alterations in

<!-- chunk -->

### metaphysical beliefs that often persisted for longer than six months. These

<!-- chunk -->

### persistent metaphysical beliefs were correlated with improved mental health

<!-- chunk -->

### outcomes. This line of research suggests that psychedelics might work by

<!-- chunk -->

### connecting people with spirituality or God, or offering them a sense of

<!-- chunk -->

### meaning and purpose. I should point out that using these on your own is not

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended. The research trials are pairing the use of psychedelics with

<!-- chunk -->

### guided therapy sessions in order to maximize benefits. Using them on your

<!-- chunk -->

### own may result in a “bad trip” or could possibly even trigger a manic or

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotic episode.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress Reduction

<!-- chunk -->

### Reducing stress is an important part of treatment. In addition to all the ways

<!-- chunk -->

### that psychotherapy and talking with other people can help reduce stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are two ways that people can do this on their own: (1) reduce or

<!-- chunk -->

### eliminate stressful environmental factors or (2) attempt to reduce your

<!-- chunk -->

### stress response when it is safe to do so.

<!-- chunk -->

### The easiest way to manage stress is to reduce or eliminate stressors

<!-- chunk -->

### when possible. For some, this is a realistic goal. A highly demanding work

<!-- chunk -->

### or school environment that is overwhelmingly stressful can be managed.

<!-- chunk -->

### The employee can find a new job, or the student and parents can reduce

<!-- chunk -->

### course load, seek academic accommodations for a disability, or change

<!-- chunk -->

### schools to find a better fit. Creating a life that is manageable, pleasurable,

<!-- chunk -->

### and rewarding is something we should all strive to do.

<!-- chunk -->

### When stressful life events occur, people will experience a stress

<!-- chunk -->

### response. This is normal and expected. But when the threatening situation is

<!-- chunk -->

### no longer a danger, reducing the stress response can have powerful,

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Stress-reduction practices have been used for millennia. Some of these

<!-- chunk -->

### are not usually thought of as “stress-reduction techniques,” but instead as

<!-- chunk -->

### longstanding religious practices, such as meditation, praying, and chanting.

<!-- chunk -->

### Additional practices include yoga, Pilates, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### breathing techniques. Many of these interventions have been shown to

<!-- chunk -->

### improve both mental and metabolic health. I won’t review all the

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions and health conditions, as there are many. However, I will

<!-- chunk -->

### share a couple of studies directly linking these benefits to metabolism and


<!-- chunk -->

### Researchers from Harvard Medical School had long known that the

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation response can play a powerful role in both mental and metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### health. The relaxation response, or RR, is a term they use to describe any of

<!-- chunk -->

### the stress-reduction techniques I already mentioned, such as meditation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Studies have demonstrated improvement in hypertension, anxiety,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and aging itself. They set out to

<!-- chunk -->

### better understand how this intervention works. They recruited nineteen

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy, long-term practitioners of daily RR practice, nineteen healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### controls, and twenty people who recently completed eight weeks of RR

<!-- chunk -->

### training. They took blood samples from all of them and looked at

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in gene expression. For those doing RR, they found significant

<!-- chunk -->

### differences in genes related to “cellular metabolism, oxidative

<!-- chunk -->

### phosphorylation, generation of reactive oxygen species and response to

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidative stress.” As you now know, these are directly related to


<!-- chunk -->

### In a follow-up study, the researchers recruited twenty-six people who

<!-- chunk -->

### had been practicing regular RR techniques for four to twenty years and

<!-- chunk -->

### another group of twenty-six people who had never regularly practiced RR

<!-- chunk -->

### but were willing to complete eight weeks of training.


<!-- chunk -->

### All the participants

<!-- chunk -->

### were then asked to listen to a twenty-minute RR recording and, in a

<!-- chunk -->

### different session, a twenty-minute health education recording. Blood

<!-- chunk -->

### samples were taken before, immediately after, and fifteen minutes after

<!-- chunk -->

### listening to each recording, and these samples were analyzed for gene

<!-- chunk -->

### expression. The researchers found that “RR practice enhanced expression of

<!-- chunk -->

### genes associated with energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, insulin

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion and telomere maintenance, and reduced expression of genes

<!-- chunk -->

### linked to inflammatory response and stress-related pathways.” A specific

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial protein (mitochondrial ATP synthase) and insulin were the

<!-- chunk -->

### top two upregulated molecules. These researchers concluded, “Our results

<!-- chunk -->

### for the first time indicate that RR elicitation, particularly after long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### practice,

<!-- chunk -->

### may evoke its downstream health benefits by improving mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### energy production and utilization and thus promoting mitochondrial

<!-- chunk -->

### resiliency . . . ” As you now know, this is precisely what we are trying to do

<!-- chunk -->

### to improve mental and metabolic health!

<!-- chunk -->

## Rehabilitation Programs

<!-- chunk -->

### Many people with chronic mental disorders lack the skills needed to

<!-- chunk -->

### independently survive and thrive in society. Some don’t know how to make

<!-- chunk -->

### friends. Others don’t know how to manage a daily schedule. Still others

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t know how to hold a job. Many feel they lack purpose in life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Their symptoms prevent most of these people from doing these things.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even if they learned how to do them prior to their illness, they might now

<!-- chunk -->

### be out of practice. For those who developed their illnesses at a young age,

<!-- chunk -->

### they may never have learned these skills in the first place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Restoring metabolic health to their brains won’t automatically teach

<!-- chunk -->

### them everything they need to know. They need training and practice. It’s

<!-- chunk -->

### like rehabilitation after a sports injury. You have to first restore the function

<!-- chunk -->

### of the muscles, bones, ligaments, or tendons, but then the person must also

<!-- chunk -->

### practice and build up strength again. Without this practice, abilities won’t

<!-- chunk -->

### be restored.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are currently rehabilitation programs that offer education, job

<!-- chunk -->

### training, and basic life skills to people with chronic mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, current research suggests they aren’t very effective. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### likely because brain function was not restored first. If people are trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### do tasks when their brains aren’t working properly, they are being set up for

<!-- chunk -->

### failure. It’s like an athlete trying to run a marathon with a torn ligament.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, if we can restore proper brain function, then rehabilitation has a

<!-- chunk -->

### decent chance of working. The goal is to help people live as productive

<!-- chunk -->

### members of society. Many of them have been beaten down for years and

<!-- chunk -->

### may feel hopeless about this goal. This hopelessness also needs to be

<!-- chunk -->

### addressed.

<!-- chunk -->

### In all of this, compassion from other humans is required. Job programs

<!-- chunk -->

### and reentry into society are needed. These people have to find reasons to

<!-- chunk -->

### live. They need to feel useful. They need to feel respected. All of this

<!-- chunk -->

### requires the involvement of other people.


<!-- chunk -->

### •Our environment and experiences play a critical role in our

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic and mental health.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Close relationships are important to human health.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Everyone should strive to have at least one role in society that

<!-- chunk -->

### allows them to contribute and feel valued. This can take the form of

<!-- chunk -->

### being a student, employee, caretaker, volunteer, mentor, or other role.

<!-- chunk -->

### It can be as simple as having household chores.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapy can play an important role in your metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Psychotherapists can add many new tools to their arsenals using the

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy theory. They can assist people in implementing

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic treatment plans, which may include diet, exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure to light, and all the other possibilities mentioned in this

<!-- chunk -->

### book.

<!-- chunk -->

### •People with chronic mental disorders may have a lot of catching up

<!-- chunk -->

### to do if they restore their brain health. Their full recovery will require

<!-- chunk -->

### rehabilitation, job training, and other programs.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Society needs to work together to ensure that everyone has adequate

<!-- chunk -->

### relationships, roles, resources, and responsibilities. All humans are

<!-- chunk -->

### not created with equal abilities, but that doesn’t mean that all humans

<!-- chunk -->

### can’t contribute, be safe and secure, and live meaningful lives.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compassion and kindness are essential to this process.

# Success Story: Sarah—Exercise and Finding Her

# Purpose

<!-- chunk -->

### Sarah was seventeen years old when I first met her. She had been diagnosed

<!-- chunk -->

### with ADHD and a learning disability in the eighth grade, had suffered from

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety and insomnia for as long as she could remember, and began having

<!-- chunk -->

### panic attacks at age fourteen. She was also depressed and had low self-

<!-- chunk -->

### esteem. She struggled in school, despite taking medications for her ADHD,

<!-- chunk -->

### and she had few friends. She had a strong family history of mental illness,

<!-- chunk -->

### with her mother, brother, sister, grandmother, two uncles, and an aunt all

<!-- chunk -->

### having been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorders, and/or bipolar

<!-- chunk -->

### disorder. That didn’t bode well for her long-term outcome. She had already

<!-- chunk -->

### tried eight different medications, which helped with her ability to

<!-- chunk -->

### concentrate, but also came with side effects and continuing symptoms. She

<!-- chunk -->

### would sometimes get so depressed that she would stay in bed all day. On

<!-- chunk -->

### top of her mental symptoms, she also had migraine headaches and frequent

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach pains.

<!-- chunk -->

### She got into college and did her best, but she struggled. Her family

<!-- chunk -->

### expected her to finish college, and this stressed her even more. She often

<!-- chunk -->

### felt that she could never live up to people’s expectations. She tried more

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressants, but they didn’t help.

<!-- chunk -->

### Things changed when she decided to take Pilates classes. She loved

<!-- chunk -->

### them! She began exercising regularly and noticed that many of her mood

<!-- chunk -->

### and anxiety symptoms were getting better. At age twenty-three, she got a

<!-- chunk -->

### job as an instructor at the studio—she was now exercising almost every day

<!-- chunk -->

### for hours per day. That was the game-changer for her. She came to an

<!-- chunk -->

### appointment after about two months on the job saying, “I feel great! I’ve

<!-- chunk -->

### never felt this good in my entire life.” On top of the exercise, she had

<!-- chunk -->

### become passionate about helping others improve their health, had made

<!-- chunk -->

### new friends, and now had a boyfriend. Despite her parents’ expectations

<!-- chunk -->

### that she finish college, she decided to drop out and focus on exercise as her

<!-- chunk -->

### career. That was almost ten years ago and Sarah continues to do well to this

<!-- chunk -->

### day. She still takes stimulant medication for her ADHD symptoms, but was

<!-- chunk -->

### able to stop

<!-- chunk -->

### all the other medications. After tapering off them, she said she actually felt

<!-- chunk -->

### even better.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sarah’s story highlights the power of exercise as a metabolic treatment,

<!-- chunk -->

### but also the psychological and social aspects of finding meaning and

<!-- chunk -->

### purpose in life, stress-reduction practices, having a social support network,

<!-- chunk -->

### and not letting the expectations of others rule us. We are all different, and

<!-- chunk -->

### want—and need—different things. Sarah found her own way to metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### and mental health.

# Why Do Current Treatments Work?

<!-- chunk -->

### hat do talking, chemicals, electricity, magnetic fields, and brain

<!-- chunk -->

### surgery have in common? They are all evidence-based treatments

<!-- chunk -->

### for mental disorders! So, why do they work? They all impact

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve already addressed medications and psychotherapy in earlier

<!-- chunk -->

### chapters. Now, I’d like to briefly explain how I think about these other

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments in the context of the brain energy theory. If this theory is true,

<!-- chunk -->

### there should be plausible explanations for why these treatments work, at

<!-- chunk -->

### least for some people.

# ECT and TMS

<!-- chunk -->

### Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation

<!-- chunk -->

### (TMS) are effective interventions for a wide variety of mental disorders.

<!-- chunk -->

### For some conditions, such as severe depression or catatonia, ECT is

<!-- chunk -->

### considered

<!-- chunk -->

### the gold standard and most effective treatment that we have available. Why

<!-- chunk -->

### do they work? The field doesn’t currently offer a comprehensive

<!-- chunk -->

### explanation. Changes in neurotransmitter levels and hormones are thought

<!-- chunk -->

### to play a role, as well as increased neuroplasticity. The brain energy theory

<!-- chunk -->

### offers one comprehensive explanation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Electricity from ECT and electromagnetic energy from TMS deliver

<!-- chunk -->

### energy directly to the brain. There’s probably no better example of a

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment being related to “brain energy.” This energy stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, and in turn, mitochondrial biogenesis. When we push

<!-- chunk -->

### ourselves in exercise, the body senses that it needs more capacity, so it

<!-- chunk -->

### produces more mitochondria to deliver this capacity. ECT and TMS appear

<!-- chunk -->

### to do the same thing. This can improve neurotransmitter and hormonal

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalances, as well as increasing neuroplasticity. These findings can be

<!-- chunk -->

### understood through mitochondria.

<!-- chunk -->

### The direct effects of ECT on mitochondria have not been extensively

<!-- chunk -->

### studied. However, one group of researchers did demonstrate increases in

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial activity of the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex of rats after

<!-- chunk -->

### delivering ECT.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another group found increased mitochondrial biogenesis

<!-- chunk -->

### and enhanced synapse formation in the hippocampus after just one ECT

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment.


<!-- chunk -->

### They also found that a series of ten treatments resulted in lasting

<!-- chunk -->

### improvements in the number of mitochondria and synapse formations three

<!-- chunk -->

### months later.

<!-- chunk -->

### TMS has been shown to improve oxidative stress, reduce inflammation,

<!-- chunk -->

### increase neuroplasticity, and impact neurotransmitter levels.


<!-- chunk -->

### As you know,

<!-- chunk -->

### these all relate to mitochondrial function. The evidence for the direct effects

<!-- chunk -->

### of TMS on mitochondria, however, is also sparse. One study found an

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in ATP levels in a rat model of stroke.


<!-- chunk -->

### Another study found

<!-- chunk -->

### increased mitochondrial integrity after TMS treatment, also in a rat model

<!-- chunk -->

### of stroke.


<!-- chunk -->

### Interestingly, psychiatry isn’t the only field that uses electricity to fix

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic problems. Cardiology commonly uses cardioversion (or shocking

<!-- chunk -->

### of the heart) when the heart is failing metabolically. Sometimes it just needs

<!-- chunk -->

### a jump-start.

# Brain Surgery and Electrical Stimulators

<!-- chunk -->

### Brain surgery is sometimes used as a last resort in people with chronic,

<!-- chunk -->

### debilitating mental disorders. Sometimes it can help. Why?

<!-- chunk -->

### This is fairly straightforward. If an area of the brain is overactive due to

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperexcitable brain cells, cutting it off from the rest of the brain can

<!-- chunk -->

### decrease symptoms. This is commonly done in epilepsy treatment. The

<!-- chunk -->

### same applies to hyperexcitable brain regions causing mental symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other cases, some brain surgeries implant electrodes to stimulate

<!-- chunk -->

### cells. This, too, is straightforward. It’s a way to stimulate underactive brain

<!-- chunk -->

### regions. It’s used in cardiology when pacemakers are implanted to deal with

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced function of the pacemaker cells of the heart. It works much the

<!-- chunk -->

### same way for underactive brain regions. Paradoxically, fast-paced

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulators can sometimes suppress overactive brain regions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Electrical stimulators have also been applied to the vagus nerve. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### called vagal nerve stimulation, or VNS. This has been helpful for epilepsy

<!-- chunk -->

### and depression, and is also being studied for PTSD, Alzheimer’s disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### schizophrenia, OCD, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia.


<!-- chunk -->

### Again, one treatment for so many seemingly unrelated conditions. The

<!-- chunk -->

### brain energy theory connects them all.


<!-- chunk -->

### For severe, treatment-resistant conditions or in life-threatening

<!-- chunk -->

### emergencies, ECT, TMS, VNS, and/or brain surgery can all play a role in

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment. However, the brain energy theory offers numerous other

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment options before these might be needed.


# Putting It All Together

# DEVELOPING YOUR METABOLIC

# TREATMENT PLAN

<!-- chunk -->

### When a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not

<!-- chunk -->

### the flower.

<!-- chunk -->

## -Alexander den Heijer

<!-- chunk -->

### he above quote is a powerful metaphor for addressing problems with

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria. In most cases, there is not a “defect” in

<!-- chunk -->

### the person but in the environment. “Fixing” a mental illness requires

<!-- chunk -->

### identifying the problems and addressing them. The “environment” in this

<!-- chunk -->

### case is writ large. It includes all factors that affect metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, such as diet, exercise, stress, light, sleep, hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, relationships, love, and meaning and purpose in life, to name

<!-- chunk -->

### just a few. Yes, some people may have inherited epigenetic factors, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### micro-RNAs, and these might be a contributing cause to their mental

<!-- chunk -->

### illness, but these can be changed, too. Metabolism is malleable, and there

<!-- chunk -->

### are many ways to improve it.

<!-- chunk -->

### You will recall that I compared all mental illnesses to delirium. Each and

<!-- chunk -->

### every case of delirium is different, even though the symptoms can be

<!-- chunk -->

### similar and the diagnosis the same. Solving the problem of delirium

<!-- chunk -->

### requires medical detective work to understand what is causing it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oftentimes, it’s more than one thing—a perfect storm in which many

<!-- chunk -->

### assaults on mitochondria are occurring at the same time. They all need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### identified and dealt with. This applies to every case of mental illness as

<!-- chunk -->

### well.

<!-- chunk -->

### The brain energy theory supports existing treatments for mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders. These will continue to play an important role. However, it also

<!-- chunk -->

### calls for radical changes. To address problems with metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### comprehensive approaches are usually required. Sometimes, identifying a

<!-- chunk -->

### simple problem and delivering a single treatment can work. Vitamin and

<!-- chunk -->

### hormone deficiencies are examples, and sometimes, simply taking an

<!-- chunk -->

### antidepressant can do the trick. But unfortunately, more often than not,

<!-- chunk -->

### simple solutions are usually not the answer.

<!-- chunk -->

### This goes against a pervasive message that we hear on a daily basis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Everyone wants simple solutions. We see on television every day that we

<!-- chunk -->

### can fix our problems with a pill. We just need to talk to our doctors and get

<!-- chunk -->

### those new prescriptions. If one pill doesn’t do it, by all means, take more.

<!-- chunk -->

### We hear the same messages from diet gurus and health experts. Don’t eat

<!-- chunk -->

### fat, and you’ll lose weight. Take this vitamin or supplement, and that will

<!-- chunk -->

### fix things.

<!-- chunk -->

### These messages, of course, are alluring. All we need to do is take a pill

<!-- chunk -->

### or do a simple intervention to fix our problems. They are much more

<!-- chunk -->

### appealing than doing the complicated work of figuring out what’s actually

<!-- chunk -->

### wrong, and then correcting the problem or problems, which might include

<!-- chunk -->

### making lifestyle changes. In reality, the simplistic fixes usually don’t work,

<!-- chunk -->

### at least not fully or permanently. The skyrocketing rates of mental and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic disorders are a clear testament to the failure of this approach. The

<!-- chunk -->

### field of medicine is increasingly recognizing this with its push toward

<!-- chunk -->

### personalized medicine, which acknowledges that there are many pathways

<!-- chunk -->

### to illness and that one-size-fits-all solutions often don’t work. People need

<!-- chunk -->

### unique treatment plans tailored to their individual situations and

<!-- chunk -->

### requirements.

# Working with a Clinician

<!-- chunk -->

### When treating serious mental disorders, it’s critically important that you

<!-- chunk -->

### work with a competent clinician. Serious mental disorders can be

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous, and people should not expect to treat these without help.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Serious” symptoms include things like hallucinations, delusions, suicidal

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking or behaviors, self-injury, aggression, out-of-control substance use,

<!-- chunk -->

### severe eating disorders, and other dangerous behaviors. These are not do-it-

<!-- chunk -->

### yourself projects to handle on your own at home. You deserve competent

<!-- chunk -->

### and compassionate medical care, so please get help developing and

<!-- chunk -->

### implementing your metabolic treatment plan. It’s important that you have

<!-- chunk -->

### support and expertise to get to a healthy and safe place as quickly as

<!-- chunk -->

### possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### For those with chronic disorders, even if just mild or moderate, you may

<!-- chunk -->

### also need to work with a clinician. A thorough medical evaluation might

<!-- chunk -->

### reveal factors that are playing a role in your illness.

# Where to Start

<!-- chunk -->

### All the contributing causes and interventions I have discussed are

<!-- chunk -->

### interrelated and affect each other. If one factor is off, others will be, too. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, if your sleep is off, your eating behavior and use of substances

<!-- chunk -->

### might be as well. Even something like the gut microbiome can be affected

<!-- chunk -->

### by sleep, light exposure, and stress. So if your microbiome is off, changing

<!-- chunk -->

### these other contributing causes might correct that issue. Alternatively,

<!-- chunk -->

### changing your microbiome might improve your sleep or stress levels. Think

<!-- chunk -->

### of everything as being part of one or more feedback loops. Therefore, all

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatments outlined in this book are possible treatments for you, even if

<!-- chunk -->

### you don’t recognize that you have a problem in these areas. Addressing

<!-- chunk -->

### mental symptoms might require changes in your sleep, diet, or light

<!-- chunk -->

### exposure.

<!-- chunk -->

### In some cases, it won’t be clear what’s causing your metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### dysfunction. Worry not. Treatment approaches can still work. The goal of

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment will be to use interventions that are known to improve

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondrial function and/or increase the supply of mitochondria. In most

<!-- chunk -->

### cases, if our cells have enough normal and healthy mitochondria, they

<!-- chunk -->

### function properly. Mitochondria know what to do. They can often fix the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem on their own.

<!-- chunk -->

### Some of you might be overwhelmed by all the treatment options. When

<!-- chunk -->

### trying to improve your metabolic health, recognize that success requires a

<!-- chunk -->

### multifaceted approach that will take time. But this means you don’t have to

<!-- chunk -->

### do everything at once—nor should you. Start with one treatment, try it for a

<!-- chunk -->

### few weeks or months, and then add additional treatments as needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oftentimes, as your metabolism begins to improve, it gives you more

<!-- chunk -->

### energy and motivation. This makes it easier to make other changes. As

<!-- chunk -->

### people begin to feel better, they often surprise themselves with how much

<!-- chunk -->

### more they can accomplish. When people complete their “metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment plans,” they often don’t recognize themselves. Not only can they

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce their symptoms of mental illness, lose weight, or have more exercise

<!-- chunk -->

### endurance, but they usually also notice stress reduction, more self-

<!-- chunk -->

### confidence, more connections with people, newfound abilities, and other

<!-- chunk -->

### life-enhancing positives.

<!-- chunk -->

### In most cases, you can decide what intervention you want to start with.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once you choose one, make it a SMART goal: Specific, Measurable,

<!-- chunk -->

### Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Once you master one intervention, add

<!-- chunk -->

### another. Keep going until you achieve your desired results.

<!-- chunk -->

### In some cases, however, one intervention may need to take priority over

<!-- chunk -->

### all others, as it could be having catastrophic effects on your metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Two obvious examples are heavy substance use or living in an abusive

<!-- chunk -->

### environment. For those who are heavily using alcohol or drugs, the other

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions will likely be futile until the substance use stops, so address

<!-- chunk -->

### that first. For people in physically abusive relationships, the first step

<!-- chunk -->

### should be to focus on a plan to get out of that environment, as difficult and

<!-- chunk -->

### dangerous as that might be. People in this situation will likely need

<!-- chunk -->

### tremendous support from family, friends, or a domestic violence program.

<!-- chunk -->

### Trying other metabolic interventions without this first step will likely be

<!-- chunk -->

### futile to address their mental and metabolic problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### All the interventions I’ve discussed have the potential to change your

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. As a rule of thumb, metabolic interventions can have four

<!-- chunk -->

### types of effects on the body and the brain:

<!-- chunk -->

## 1.Initiation—When you first make a change, this can abruptly shift

<!-- chunk -->

### your metabolism. Sometimes, this can be helpful. Other times, it can

<!-- chunk -->

### make things worse, at least initially.

<!-- chunk -->

## 2.Adaptation—Whenever you make a metabolic change, your body

<!-- chunk -->

### will work to adapt. These adaptations are usually designed to

<!-- chunk -->

### counteract the effects of the metabolic intervention. They usually

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t negate the intervention, but they will often lessen its effects

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to the initiation phase.

<!-- chunk -->

## 3.Maintenance—At some point, your metabolism will become fully

<!-- chunk -->

### adapted to the intervention and your body and brain will feel more

<!-- chunk -->

### stable. You can always increase the dose or intensity of the

<!-- chunk -->

### intervention, which will then take you back to the initiation and

<!-- chunk -->

### adaptation phases again.

<!-- chunk -->

## 4.Withdrawal—If metabolic interventions are reduced or stopped

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly, there is usually a withdrawal reaction. Metabolism will often

<!-- chunk -->

### rebound too high or too low in these situations, which can produce

<!-- chunk -->

### withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### All these situations can happen with all the treatments I’ve mentioned,

<!-- chunk -->

### including medications, light therapy, changes in diet, changes in the gut

<!-- chunk -->

### microbiome, supplement use, and even psychological and social

<!-- chunk -->

### interventions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember that you’re looking for interventions that will improve your

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolic health over the long run. So, even if an intervention makes things

<!-- chunk -->

### worse initially, such as experiencing irritability when starting a new diet, if

<!-- chunk -->

### the maintenance phase will lead to improved metabolic health, it’s worth

<!-- chunk -->

### pursuing. Obviously, it needs to be done in a way that is safe and tolerable,

<!-- chunk -->

### but getting to the maintenance phase is the goal. Likewise, other things,

<!-- chunk -->

### such as heavy alcohol use, can make things feel better in the short run

<!-- chunk -->

### (initiation phase), but can impair metabolism over the long run

<!-- chunk -->

### (maintenance phase). Stopping its use (withdrawal phase) can be

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly difficult and dangerous for heavy drinkers. It’s important to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep these in mind, as starting and stopping treatments needs to be done

<!-- chunk -->

### safely.

# Inpatient and Residential Treatment Programs

<!-- chunk -->

### For some people with serious mental disorders, designing a comprehensive

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment plan might be impossible to do on their own. By definition, they

<!-- chunk -->

### have impaired brain function. They may not be able to stay on task, learn

<!-- chunk -->

### new information easily, stick to a diet, or fit all the changes into a daily

<!-- chunk -->

### schedule. It doesn’t mean they can’t do it, or that they won’t benefit from it,

<!-- chunk -->

### but they may need help. For others, mental symptoms can sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### threaten their safety or the safety of others and trying treatments on an

<!-- chunk -->

### outpatient basis may be dangerous. For all these people, we need to develop

<!-- chunk -->

### inpatient and residential metabolic treatment programs. These programs can

<!-- chunk -->

### customize treatment plans to people’s specific needs. They can provide

<!-- chunk -->

### support not only through professionals working at the program, but through

<!-- chunk -->

### the peer support from other participants. These will be environments where

<!-- chunk -->

### everyone is working to improve their mental and metabolic health together.

# Designing Your Treatment Plan

<!-- chunk -->

### •If you have serious, dangerous, or chronic symptoms, you should

<!-- chunk -->

### work with a clinician.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Identify contributing causes that are leading to severe metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### impairment or threatening your safety (e.g., suicide attempts, severe

<!-- chunk -->

### substance use, living in a physically abusive environment, an

<!-- chunk -->

### out-of-control eating disorder, severe lack of sleep, etc.). If you have

<!-- chunk -->

### any of these, you need to address them first.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Choose one or more of the treatments outlined in this book that you

<!-- chunk -->

### think might help.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Implement the treatment and give it at least three months to start

<!-- chunk -->

### working.

<!-- chunk -->

### •If the treatment improves any of your symptoms, even if just a little

<!-- chunk -->

### bit, keep doing it.

<!-- chunk -->

### •If a treatment doesn’t help at all after three months, feel free to stop

<!-- chunk -->

### it.

<!-- chunk -->

### •If a treatment helps but doesn’t resolve all your symptoms, add

<!-- chunk -->

### another treatment. You are now developing your multifaceted

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment plan.

<!-- chunk -->

### •Continue to add or try treatments until you achieve your desired

<!-- chunk -->

### results.

<!-- chunk -->

### Your goals might change over time. Initially, you might only want to get rid

<!-- chunk -->

### of one symptom. That’s fine. As life goes on, you might decide that you’d

<!-- chunk -->

### like to improve some other areas as well. Life is a journey. We all have

<!-- chunk -->

### areas of strength, but we also all have areas of weakness and vulnerability.

<!-- chunk -->

### No one is perfect. I hope that you will make the most of your life and strive

<!-- chunk -->

### to improve your health as much as possible. But I also hope that you can

<!-- chunk -->

### reach a point of gratitude for the health and strength that you do have and

<!-- chunk -->

### simply enjoy it.

### Beth began psychiatric treatment at age nine after being diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### ADHD. She was prescribed stimulants and did well in school, getting

<!-- chunk -->

### mostly

<!-- chunk -->

### As and Bs. However, she was still impulsive and often interrupted people.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a result, she didn’t have many friends, often felt criticized or rejected by

<!-- chunk -->

### others, and struggled with low self-esteem. By high school, things were

<!-- chunk -->

### much worse. She had chronic depression, was frequently suicidal, and

<!-- chunk -->

### began cutting herself with knives or razor blades. She tried antidepressants,

<!-- chunk -->

### more stimulants, mood stabilizers, anxiety medications, and even

<!-- chunk -->

### antipsychotics, but her symptoms only worsened. By the time she was in

<!-- chunk -->

### college, she had been hospitalized many times.

<!-- chunk -->

### Beth was twenty-one when I first met her. She was diagnosed with

<!-- chunk -->

### chronic depression, panic disorder, borderline personality disorder,

<!-- chunk -->

### premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and ADHD. She was on five medications,

<!-- chunk -->

### and they clearly weren’t helping. In fact, she was often lethargic and out of

<!-- chunk -->

### it. She had been in a few car accidents as a result. She had returned home

<!-- chunk -->

### during her summer break from college for more intensive psychiatric

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment. At first, I prescribed even more antipsychotic and mood-

<!-- chunk -->

### stabilizing medications, which often gave her new side effects or simply

<!-- chunk -->

### didn’t work. At the same time, we began dialectical behavior therapy

<!-- chunk -->

### (DBT), which is a type of psychotherapy focused on skills that can help

<!-- chunk -->

### people better manage their emotions, suicidal impulses, and self-injury.

<!-- chunk -->

### Beth and I both believed that medications had not helped her and, in

<!-- chunk -->

### fact, may have contributed to her problems, so we agreed to slowly taper

<!-- chunk -->

### her off them. This was extremely difficult and dangerous. Almost every

<!-- chunk -->

### time we reduced a medication, even if just by a tiny amount, she would

<!-- chunk -->

### experience an increase in symptoms—depression, suicidal impulses, or

<!-- chunk -->

### urges to cut herself. We used DBT skills to manage these symptoms and

<!-- chunk -->

### keep her safe, but we continued on with the medication taper. It took several

<!-- chunk -->

### years to get her off everything. By the time we did, things were much better.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was able to keep herself safe, had been able to hold a job, and had

<!-- chunk -->

### finished college.

<!-- chunk -->

### The next phase of her recovery started with exercise. She began riding

<!-- chunk -->

### her bicycle outside and really got into it. She decided to work up to a

<!-- chunk -->

### charity ride. She then joined Weight Watchers to lose some weight, which

<!-- chunk -->

### helped even more. Her psychiatric symptoms were all but gone now. After

<!-- chunk -->

### many

<!-- chunk -->

### long discussions between us and her family and friends, we agreed that she

<!-- chunk -->

### no longer needed therapy or any psychiatric treatment. But that didn’t stop

<!-- chunk -->

### her metabolic treatment! Beth went on to become an accomplished athlete,

<!-- chunk -->

### competing in triathlons and ultramarathons. She got married. She got a full-

<!-- chunk -->

### time job.

<!-- chunk -->

### Today, about ten years later, Beth continues to feel great and has no

<!-- chunk -->

### psychiatric symptoms. When I ran into her father (who happens to be a

<!-- chunk -->

### physician) recently, he gave me an update on how well she was doing and

<!-- chunk -->

### said, “You know that you saved her life. You really did. I can’t imagine that

<!-- chunk -->

### she would still be here today if it wasn’t for you.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Beth’s case illustrates the common problem of having multiple

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnoses, getting lots of treatment, and still not doing well. In fact, it

<!-- chunk -->

### appears all but certain that the medications were contributing to her

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, if not causing them. This doesn’t mean that medications can’t be

<!-- chunk -->

### immensely helpful for some people. I think they can be. However, for Beth,

<!-- chunk -->

### they appeared to be making matters worse. Some of the medications that

<!-- chunk -->

### she was taking are known to impair metabolism and mitochondrial function,

<!-- chunk -->

### so the brain energy theory offers an explanation for her improvement off the

<!-- chunk -->

### medications. But that wasn’t enough for her full recovery. She also

<!-- chunk -->

### exercised, and lost weight, and found love, and a job, and self-respect.

<!-- chunk -->

### These all played a role in her extraordinary recovery.


# A New Day for Mental and

# Metabolic Health

<!-- chunk -->

### he brain energy theory offers a new model of mental health. It’s about

<!-- chunk -->

### much more than just brain function; it’s about metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### mitochondria, which impact almost all aspects of human health, aging,

<!-- chunk -->

### and longevity. This new model cuts across diagnostic categories and

<!-- chunk -->

### addresses many disorders all at once. It applies not only to those diagnosed

<!-- chunk -->

### with “mental” illness, but also to those who suffer from related metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain disorders. Almost all people with these

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders have at least some “mental” symptoms, and people with mental

<!-- chunk -->

### disorders are more likely to develop these related disorders. This new

<!-- chunk -->

### model offers the hope of preventing illnesses and keeping people happy,

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy, and productive for longer than is currently possible.

<!-- chunk -->

### The theory of brain energy is a significant breakthrough that finally

<!-- chunk -->

### connects the dots to give us a clearer picture of mental illness. The science

<!-- chunk -->

### and evidence are integrated into one framework, uniting the biological,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological, and social theories of mental illness. As we embrace the idea

<!-- chunk -->

### that mental disorders are no longer syndromes but metabolic disorders of

<!-- chunk -->

### the brain, new solutions become obvious. We need to restore brain energy

<!-- chunk -->

### by normalizing metabolism and the function of mitochondria. Once we do

<!-- chunk -->

### this, the symptoms of mental illness will begin to resolve.

<!-- chunk -->

### The good news is that this new understanding lets us apply existing

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments more effectively and suggests novel treatment options we

<!-- chunk -->

### already have access to, including all the treatments I’ve shared in this book.

<!-- chunk -->

### We don’t have to wait years before trying them. This doesn’t mean that

<!-- chunk -->

### what we have now is enough—not all interventions will work for everyone,

<!-- chunk -->

### and we need more research and additional treatments. Finding new

<!-- chunk -->

### treatments, however, will be immensely easier now that we’ve connected

<!-- chunk -->

### the dots and identified the core problem. It’s a problem that can now be

<!-- chunk -->

### solved with science and research, no longer some abstract mystery waiting

<!-- chunk -->

### on a miracle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Once we begin thinking about all these disorders through the lens of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and mitochondria, the possibilities for improvement are

<!-- chunk -->

### endless. We can develop diagnostic tools to assess people’s metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### health. We can develop evidence-based strategies and therapeutics to

<!-- chunk -->

### address metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction. We can focus on better

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding the impact on mitochondria and metabolism of medications,

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol, tobacco, recreational drugs, diets and foods, and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### But we need resources to do this work. We need big changes! We need

<!-- chunk -->

### multidisciplinary healthcare teams working together to restore metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### health in people. These teams will include physicians, nurses,

<!-- chunk -->

### psychotherapists, social workers, physical and occupational therapists,

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmacists, dietitians, personal trainers, health and wellness coaches, and

<!-- chunk -->

### many others. Health insurance will need to cover some of these costs. The

<!-- chunk -->

### biotech and pharmaceutical industries will need to rise to the challenge of

<!-- chunk -->

### developing more effective therapeutics. Government will need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### involved. We need research funding for all this work and parity for mental

<!-- chunk -->

### health services. We may also have metabolic toxins in our everyday lives

<!-- chunk -->

### that need to be regulated and/or eliminated. And of course, each and every

<!-- chunk -->

### one of us will need

<!-- chunk -->

### to do our part as well. We need self-help groups, support groups, and

<!-- chunk -->

### advocacy initiatives. We need a society that is just, fair, compassionate,

<!-- chunk -->

### peaceful, and cooperative. We need to ensure that all people have

<!-- chunk -->

### opportunities to live meaningful lives. People need to feel safe. They also

<!-- chunk -->

### benefit from feeling respected. Obviously, this is all easier said than done.

<!-- chunk -->

### In many ways, it represents a type of utopia. We all know that will take time

<!-- chunk -->

### to achieve. But we don’t need to wait for utopia in order to do something.

<!-- chunk -->

### And so, I call on you and ask for your help. To turn this hope into

<!-- chunk -->

### reality, we need a grassroots movement. Just as there were movements for

<!-- chunk -->

### HIV/AIDS and breast cancer, we desperately need a movement calling for

<!-- chunk -->

### radical changes in the way we understand and treat mental illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Educating and informing people will take time and effort. You can help by

<!-- chunk -->

### spreading the word about the theory of brain energy. This movement needs

<!-- chunk -->

### you, your friends, and your family. I’m not asking for myself, but on behalf

<!-- chunk -->

### of the countless people who are suffering from mental illness alone and in

<!-- chunk -->

### silence; on behalf of those begging for more effective treatments and better

<!-- chunk -->

### lives; on behalf of those who are tormented on a daily basis by their mental

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms; on behalf of those who have lost all hope; on behalf of all the

<!-- chunk -->

### people who continue to hide in their homes in shame and humiliation from

<!-- chunk -->

### the stigma of mental illness; and in memory of the countless people who

<!-- chunk -->

### couldn’t hold on and are no longer with us. Let’s put an end to this

<!-- chunk -->

### suffering, once and for all. Let’s not waste another day.

# Acknowledgments

<!-- chunk -->

### When I began writing Brain Energy, some people recommended that I make

<!-- chunk -->

### it a simple self-help book as opposed to a more rigorous science book

<!-- chunk -->

### because simple messages are easier to sell and many publishers aren’t

<!-- chunk -->

### interested in science books. I want to thank my publisher, BenBella, and in

<!-- chunk -->

### particular Leah Wilson and Alexa Stevenson, for believing in me and this

<!-- chunk -->

### book and for recognizing that people are, in fact, interested in science and

<!-- chunk -->

### complexity, especially when it has the potential to transform a field and

<!-- chunk -->

### improve people’s lives.

<!-- chunk -->

### To my editor, Alexa Stevenson, thank you for your keen insights, honest

<!-- chunk -->

### feedback, and for encouraging me to include more science and evidence,

<!-- chunk -->

### not less. Your initial “healthy skepticism” of the brain energy theory pushed

<!-- chunk -->

### me to write an immensely better book.

<!-- chunk -->

### To my literary agent, Linda Konner, thank you for your fierce

<!-- chunk -->

### representation of this work. I knew you were tough when I met you, but

<!-- chunk -->

### seeing you in action took it to a whole new level.

<!-- chunk -->

### To the entire team at BenBella, thank you for your creativity, attention

<!-- chunk -->

### to detail, adherence to timelines, and everything else that goes into

<!-- chunk -->

### producing an amazing book.

<!-- chunk -->

### To my early reviewers—Karen Weintraub, Anne Rauch, Julianne

<!-- chunk -->

### Torrence, Amy Yuhasz, and my brother, David Palmer—your

<!-- chunk -->

### encouragement

<!-- chunk -->

### and critiques of early drafts gave me the energy and confidence to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### writing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Finally, to all the patients I’ve worked with over the past 31 years (I’m

<!-- chunk -->

### including medical school in these years), every single one of you helped me

<!-- chunk -->

### write this book, because I learned something about mental illness and the

<!-- chunk -->

### human condition from each of you. Thank you for the honor and privilege

<!-- chunk -->

### of being your psychiatrist. Thanks to the ones who were willing to try my

<!-- chunk -->

### “metabolic treatments,” and especially those willing to share their stories in

<!-- chunk -->

### this book or appear publicly with me in presentations, on television, and on

<!-- chunk -->

### national radio. To the ones who never got better under my care despite

<!-- chunk -->

### trying treatment after treatment, I want to apologize on behalf of myself and

<!-- chunk -->

### my profession. It was you who taught me to question and challenge my own

<!-- chunk -->

### work and the mental health field, and to not accept the unacceptable

<!-- chunk -->

### paradigm. You inspired me to ponder endlessly about neuroscience,

<!-- chunk -->

### physiology, and human existence. You forced me to look for better answers.

<!-- chunk -->

### My greatest hope is that this book might represent the beginning of those

<!-- chunk -->

### answers.
