mineral water to one part of fresh, sugar-free juice. The diluted juices are sipped throughout the day. Ideally, a different juice is used each day: celery, carrot, papaya, cranberry, berry, apple, pineapple, and other fruits or vegetables that have not been consumed on a daily basis. Citrus fruits should be avoided. Low-allergen protein supplements, such as Ultra Clear, MEDIPRO Protein Powder, pure free-form amino acids, N Foods, and Vivonex, may be added after the third day. In addition, liberal amounts of pure water should be consumed throughout the day to dilute and flush out toxic substances.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: This approach works for most patients with Candida yeast

infections because the juice is so dilute that it rarely creates a problem. However, commercially prepared juices (especially tomato and citrus juice) often contain molds, which can be problematic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fruit and/or Vegetable Plan

In the fruit and/or vegetable plan, the patient consumes unlimited amounts of clean, fresh fruit and melons and raw, steamed, or baked veg- etables throughout the day. If Candida overgrowth is severe, or if weight loss is desired, vegetables should be emphasized and fruits limited.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Caveman (Caveperson) Plan

The caveperson plan consists of the following basic foods that the caveperson consumed, after the major allergenic foods have been eliminated: vegetables, fruits, berries, honey, nuts, seeds, beans, peas, sprouts, roots, gourds, poultry, fish, seafood, and wild game.

<!-- chunk -->

## Procedure

<!-- chunk -->

## Beginning the Elimination Diet

An ideal elimination diet begins as follows: • 2 days of diluted juices • Fruits and vegetables for the next 2 days • The caveperson diet for 2 days or until symptoms clear Any one, or any combination, of the previously described elimi- nation plans will clear the patient of allergenic substances. If after days the patient’s symptoms have not diminished (or disappeared), continue the diet for another 5 days. If symptoms are not clear in days, begin to rotate foods because the patient may be reacting to a food or substance he or she is consuming every day. (Unsuspected environmental allergens may be contributing to the symptoms also; see “Helpful Hints and Suggestions” later in this chapter.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Testing by Challenge Ingestion

One suspect food is introduced every other day. The object is to give the patient sufficient calories, build a reliable list of safe foods, and delay unpleasant reactions for as long as possible. The challenge should begin with rarely ingested foods that are least likely to cause adverse reactions. Foods that are known to cause severe reactions should not be tested with challenge.

<!-- chunk -->

## Suggested testing sequence. Introduce foods back into the diet

in the following order whenever possible: vegetables, fruits, melons, beans, nuts and seeds, yeasts, dairy products, and finally, grains. When dairy is added, goat products should be tested first: plain yogurt, cheeses, and then milk. Follow the same process with cow’s milk. Grains are best tested in the following order (gluten-containing grains are in italics): quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, wild rice, brown rice, millet, barley, spelt, kamut, teff, oats, rye, corn, and lastly, wheat. Dietary supplements should also be tested one at a time.

<!-- chunk -->

## Food and symptom diary. The patient records, chronologically in

a notebook, all foods, liquids, supplements, moods, symptoms, and reactions. The foods eaten throughout the day should be noted in either pencil or blue or black ink. Symptoms are highlighted or circled in colored ink so that those adverse reactions stand out clearly. In 2 to weeks, a repetitive pattern of symptoms will be clearly visible, allowing for identification and elimination of the problematic foods or food combinations that cause symptoms. In the beginning, a patient may not be able to describe in exact words how he or she feels, so a numbering system may be useful for noting general moods throughout the day. Numbers go from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent); feeling sort of medium, neither poor nor excellent, would be recorded as a 5. In general, depending on the patient’s health and motivation, foods causing a mild reaction should be avoided for 3 months, and those causing a severe reaction are best avoided for at least 6 months before being reintroduced.

<!-- chunk -->

## Testing children. Play a game with children to make testing fun.

Have them draw a picture of how they feel, or write their names before and after testing a substance. Note all before-and-after differences in the drawings or writings.

# THE DIVERSIFIED ROTATION DIET

The basic concept of the diversified rotation diet is to achieve the following: • Eliminate all major allergenic substances. • Eat the remaining foods once every 4 days. • Allow 2 to 4 days between food families. Rotation can be simplified by using a template—the “master chart”—with foods correctly arranged according to their botanical family classifications. The spacing of the foods and food families is organized into four columns, one for each day, so the patient simply chooses foods from the appropriate column each day. A color-coding system further simplifies the process of choosing the correct foods. See Appendix 11 for an easy-to-follow template. The chart provides 4 days between specific foods and 2 days between food families. A sec- ond chart (Master Chart II) may be needed for severely sensitive indi- viduals. It provides 4 days between specific foods and 4 days between food families. If necessary, it can be easily adapted to a 7-day rotation.

## Using the Master Charts

The clinician uses a pencil to cross out the major allergens, plus any known or suspected problem foods, in each of the four columns. The patient may eat the remaining foods from the appropriate column throughout the day. The foods that are not crossed out are allowed in the diet. Arrows on the chart ( ↔ ) indicate a food that is essentially the only food of a family and that is not cross-reactive with other foods. Therefore it is not restricted to any one particular day and can be moved to another column if additional food choices are needed. Patients who will be rotating foods for any length of time will wel- come the benefits of using the color-coding system. A color is assigned to each day. Each column represents a day: day 1, green, is column 1; day 2, yellow, column 2; day 3, blue, column 3; and day 4, red, column 4. After day 4, the patient returns to day 1 and repeats the process. Food containers are labeled and color-coded to coordinate with the color of the day; for example, green labels, twist-ties, or rubber bands are placed on all containers of foods for day 1. The color-coding system enables the entire family to see at a glance which foods the patient is permitted to eat on each day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Modifications for Vegans

The master charts can be used for vegans. Simply cross out all foods of animal origin. Legumes (beans and peas) are generally an important part of the vegan diet; thus all legumes should be tested, one at a time, begin- ning with the least allergenic, rarely eaten beans and proceeding to soy and tofu, with peanuts tested last. Depending on the allergic response to legumes, the patient may be able to tolerate legumes daily, as long as he or she eats a different legume each day. In other words, although the 4-days-between-foods rule continues to be honored, the 1-day- between-food-families rule may be ignored for less-sensitive patients.

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Preparation

For testing purposes, fresh, organic foods should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, frozen or dehydrated foods are a better choice than canned goods. Most vegetables are best eaten raw, steamed, or baked. Fish, poultry, and meat are best poached, steamed, sautéed, baked, or simmered in a slow cooker (e.g., crock-pot). Soups and stews are fine. Use only sea salt for seasoning; all spices and flavorings must be avoided unless they are individually tested. Blood glucose levels may need to be stabilized with small, frequent meals throughout the day. Have the patient prepare four mixtures of “trail mix”—nuts and dried fruits—one for each day (refer to the mas- ter chart for specific food choices). A supply of healthy snacks must be maintained everywhere: home, school, office, and automobile.

## Helpful Hints and Suggestions

<!-- chunk -->

## Control of Withdrawal Symptoms and Allergenic Reactions

Vitamin C buffered with calcium, potassium, and/or magnesium is suggested as the daily source of vitamin C for allergenic individuals. These substances help balance an acidic body pH and are valuable for neutralizing unpleasant allergic reactions. Stabilization of pH eases the symptoms of withdrawal from allergenic foods and the cravings that occur when the patient is breaking an addiction, whether it is to sugar, wheat, coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, or a drug. For daily supplementation, begin with 1/8 teaspoon of buffered vitamin C powder (or one 500 mg capsule) in 1/2 cup of water three times a day (between meals and at bedtime). Gradually increase the dosage by an additional 1/8 teaspoon (1 capsule) per dose every days until the patient reaches bowel tolerance—loose stool, gas, or diarrhea—at which point the dosage is reduced. As the patient improves, the vitamin C requirement will likely lessen, and the dos- age can be reduced again.

<!-- chunk -->

## Note: Buffered vitamin C should not be taken with meals because it

may neutralize stomach acid, which is commonly deficient in patients with food allergy and/or intolerance (see Chapter 14). For temporary relief of symptoms or to neutralize an adverse reaction, the patient should mix and drink 1/2 teaspoon of buff- ered vitamin C in 1/2 cup of water or dilute juice. Available com- mercial products include Klaire Labs Bicarbs (see http://www.klaire labs.com), Cardiovascular Lab’s Tri-Salts (see http://www.cardiovas- cularlabs.com), and Alka Seltzer gold label (not the blue label, see http://www.alkaseltzer.com); if none of these products is available, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in 1/2 cup of water can be useful.

<!-- chunk -->

## Environmental Allergies

If the patient does not respond to the diet in a timely fashion, and all other possibilities have been ruled out, the clinician should sus- pect environmental and/or chemical sensitivities. The first step in this instance is to eliminate the use of all scented toiletries, room sprays, and cleaning solutions in the home and workplace.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ensuring Adequate Protein Intake

The most allergenic foods tend to be those highest in protein; thus care must be taken to ensure that the patient is consuming ade- quate amounts of protein. Patients with multiple food allergies may need to be referred to an experienced nutritionist to develop a balanced diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Patience

The clinician must be especially supportive and patient with individ- uals who have received only long-term conventional treatment. You may be the first physician to discuss the rewards of listening to their bodies and explain how symptoms are the body’s way of communi- cating. Learning to pay attention to what they eat and drink and the possible adverse symptoms is a vital part of getting well again.

## 383CHAPTER 47 Soft Tissue Manipulation: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Potential

# HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF SOFT TISSUE

# MANIPULATION: THE BIG PICTURE

For every therapeutic intervention, we must first determine how best to use the technique and/or intervention. For soft tissue manipulation, there are localized responses that will be addressed later in this chapter; this section is devoted to how soft tissue manipulation affects overall health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune System

Clinically, many who practice soft tissue manipulation have noted various immune responses from patients and clients. The evidence for these effects has been elucidated, mostly through studies of massage therapy. Because the immune system receives messages and is con- trolled by the nervous and endocrine systems, the effects of soft tissue manipulation regarding the immune system are neuroendocrine in nature.20

<!-- chunk -->

## Emotional

Soft tissue manipulation has been shown to help the emotional sta- tus of individuals experiencing depression, eating disorders, excessive anger, rage, rejection, and fear. Using soft tissue manipulation as an adjunct therapy when treating individuals with emotional distress can have widespread systemic effects that may prove to be necessary.21–26

<!-- chunk -->

## Endocrine

Inappropriate amounts of hormones will cause a breakdown in this important system of control. Most notable, especially with regard to soft tissue manipulation, is excess cortisol. Soft tissue manipulation has been found to decrease inappropriately elevated levels of corti- sol. The effects of chronically high cortisol levels occur at the hypo- thalamic–pituitary–axis level and can disrupt and create aberrations in neuroendocrine function. In addition, soft tissue manipulation has also been shown to raise low levels of dopamine and serotonin; this effect has implications in treating addictions, eating disorders, depres- sion, and more.27–31 What this author is referring to in this subsection is the effect that soft tissue manipulation has on our ability to maintain homeo- stasis or homeodynamics after the introduction of a stressful stim- ulus. According to Selye and proponents of the General Adaptation Syndrome line of thought, our physical, biochemical, and emotional beings can withstand a certain amount of stress.32 Everyone has a differ- ent threshold, and soft tissue manipulation allows the practitioner the opportunity to remove layers of stress so that we can adapt and thrive.

# DEFINITION: FUNCTIONAL SOFT TISSUE

As noted in the introduction, thoughts, ideas, and theories surrounding soft tissue diagnosis and manipulation are evolving. The phrase “func- tional soft tissue” has been used by this author and others. The idea that muscles, bones, tendons, fascia, and ligaments are separate entities is an idea that, although true in a histological sense, is not the whole truth in a functional sense. A more clinically useful idea is that all of these structures transmit tension. Some of them contract, others resist tension, others give way to tension; the bottom line is they all respond and transmit tension. What many consider the apex of the soft tissue evolution is that soft tissue pathologies exist when the transmission of this tension is altered. As a result, various authors have developed ideas that link all connective and soft tissues together functionally. Myers developed the “Anatomy Trains” idea, and Stecco developed ideas that link soft tissues together functionally through fascial motor units, cen- ters of coordination, centers of perception, and centers of fusion. Ida Rolf was on the cutting edge of these ideas and looked at the physical body as a transmitter of tension.7–9,15 Taking the idea of functional soft tissues one step further, the fitness and performance professions are evolving closely with the clinical soft tissue manipulation professions to develop very integrative and useful movement therapies. These movement therapies bridge the gap between more passive soft tissue manipulative techniques and exercise. Many effective soft tissue manipulative techniques include active movement and mobilization on the patient’s and/or client’s part. These therapeutic procedures, combined with more passive soft tissue interventions, are proving to be more effective than passive techniques alone.33

# SOFT TISSUE PATHOLOGIES

Many of the focal soft tissue lesions and dysfunctions listed can be clas- sified as myofascial points; some are more descriptive, whereas others are the terminology used when describing a diagnosis. This author feels it necessary to note that this is not a comprehensive list of poten- tial soft tissue points and/or lesions, but that most, if not all, soft tissue lesions will fall into these categories: • Tender points • Trigger points • Fascial densifications • Strains/sprains • Fibrosis • Adhesions • Chapman’s reflex points Researchers and clinicians have used different terminology to describe similar phenomena, resulting in confusion of what is essen- tially an uncomplicated pattern. In the musculature and connective tissues of the body, often in the regions of the origins and insertions of the muscles, soft tissue points are often commonly found at motor points and in the muscle belly. The commonality, despite differing opinions on diagnostic criteria and the manner in which they are assessed, is palpable, sensitive areas of altered structure resulting from injury, anoxia, irritation, stress, aberrant reflex activity, and/or aber- rant movement patterns. Another commonality to these points is their size, which ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 cm across, and their feel, which is described either as harder or firmer than surrounding normal tissue or as having an “edematous,” “boggy,” “fibrous,” or “stringy” feel.34 It is often noted that these localized areas of altered structure and function occur in bands of stressed fibers, both fascial and muscular. In all cases, such localized areas are, to a greater or lesser degree, sensitive or tender out of proportion to the amount of pressure exerted.35 All these points are potential “trigger points,” but only those that, upon pressure, are noted to refer pain or other symptoms to a distant (tar- get) area and that are recognizable as “familiar” to the individual are classified as such points.36,37

## Methods of Identification

Despite all of the advances in imaging, the most widely used clinical procedure to identify soft tissue pathology is a combination of move- ment, special (orthopedic) tests, and skilled palpation. The diagnostic use of movement patterns will be discussed in the next section; they, too, can be used to locate focal soft tissue lesions and points.16,38–40 The definitions of the previously mentioned soft tissue pathologies can be and are debated. Often, clinicians name a focal soft tissue lesion a “trigger point” when many more of us would call it a “tender point.” Likewise, fascial densifications can be tender points, trigger-point adhesions, and/or fibrosis. Then there are reflex points that can eluci- date functional and pathological problems in and around the viscera; Chapman’s points are examples of such points.

## 384SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

There are a variety of methods by which soft tissue changes may be located through palpation. They include the following: • Traditional massage methods—mainly palpatory awareness during various massage strokes like effleurage, petrissage, tapotement, and vibration. • Specific palpation techniques—such as those developed by mas- sage, naturopathic, chiropractic, physical therapy, and osteopathic schools. The common thread is the development of fine motor skills and palpatory awareness, the foundation of which is a solid knowledge of structural and functional anatomy. • Neuromuscular technique—a method of combined assessment and therapy developed in the 1930s by Stanley Lief, an Ameri- can-trained naturopathic and chiropractic physician working in Europe. • Skin distraction, pinching, and gliding techniques All of these, as well as other methods of palpation, may be used to identify areas of local soft tissue dysfunction that may be either sources or results of reflex activity or other local adaptive responses. All of these techniques are used to assess and notice areas of tone, texture, and temperature abnormalities as well as developmental and structural asymmetry. The analysis of the available information present in localized areas of the soft tissues requires consideration of a variety of classifications and systems. It is necessary to examine some of the systems that have described the same tissue changes in different ways, to compare the similarities and differences in the descriptions of points (discrete, usually sensitive areas of altered structure and function in the soft tissue) and the diagnostic and therapeutic significance ascribed to them.

## Aberrant Movement Patterns

As noted in the introduction, soft tissue diagnostics and therapeutics are evolving into a more functional paradigm; with this evolution comes a journey into the idea that movement patterns will help clini- cians elucidate soft tissue dysfunction and focal lesions.4–9,11,36

<!-- chunk -->

## Methods of Identification

The simplest description of detecting and diagnosing movement patterns is that they are performed through observation and patient movements (active and passive). All of the techniques for this type of assessment have this in common; which movements and how they should be performed are debatable. Simple, single planar movement patterns have been assessed by many.6,11 These are often easier to assess, but their relevance has been questioned over the past 10 years. Multiplanar movement patterns have been purportedly better, more accurate, and more clinically rel- evant in the assessment of soft tissue and other neuromusculoskele- tal structures.4–9,36 There is no definitive proof as to which strategy and which motions are the most clinically relevant. Clinicians have begun to use patterns described as “primitive” by Gray Cook and Kyle Kiesel.4,5 The aforementioned clinicians and authors designed a suc- cinct and concise assessment of seven movements. These movements range from deep squats to toe touches, lunges, push-ups, and active straight leg raises. The assessment of these motions has been given a point system: 0 means there is pain with the movement pattern; 1 is difficulty performing it even after some compensatory correction; is difficulty performing it without said compensation but having the ability to perform it with said compensation; and 3 is full ability and stability while performing each pattern. The relevance of each pat- tern is speculative and debatable. Gray36 designed a complex assess- ment of movement patterns through triplanar movements. Although the theory behind his assessments is similar to Cook’s and others, his procedures are unique. This is not a concise and neatly packaged tech- nique, but many clinicians are seeing great results with their patients using Gray’s theories and applications.

## Soft Tissue Manipulation Techniques

Therapeutic efforts and techniques may be directed toward the diag- nosis and treatment of the mechanical aspects of dysfunction (trauma, strain, aberrant movement patterns, etc.) and toward the use of the available information from such reflex areas in a more wide-ranging, holistic approach to the health of the patient.37 General, rhythmic techniques are often employed on the soft tis- sues to relieve local dysfunction and/or to prepare for subsequent adjustment of osseous structure. There are common threads to each technique; many use rocking and other rhythmic movements, compression and ischemic compression, and a variety of contacts (hands, digital pressure, elbows, and various devices). In all of the available soft tissue techniques, the objectives are the improvement of circulation and drainage; release of contracture, fibrosis, and/or adhesion; greater range of movement; decreased pain and improved movement; and stability. Most soft tissue methods can be applied in a stimulatory as well as a relaxing or inhibitory manner, but care should be taken to prevent stimulation from becoming an irritation. Table 47.1 presents a survey of various soft tissue techniques and a brief description of each.

## The Potential of Soft Tissue Manipulation

The professions that use manual medicine are experiencing a resur- gence in the tradition of “hands-on” assessment, treatments, and therapies. The musculoskeletal system is both the greatest energy consumer and the largest organ of sensory input in the body. This primary machinery of life has long been unappreciated in

therapeutic terms. The development of methods such as strain/ counterstrain, muscle energy technique, fascial manipulation, trig- ger-point therapy, and neuromuscular technique and research, as well as other reflex systems, ensures that the diagnostic and thera- peutic potential of the soft tissues is increasingly being recognized and used. Korr, the premier osteopathic researcher of the second half of the 20th century, summarized another vital implication of soft tissue dysfunction—interference with axonal transport mechanisms—as follows: Any factor that causes derangement of transport mechanism in the axon or that chronically alters the quality or quantity of the axonally transported substances could cause the trophic influences to become detrimental. This alteration in turn would produce aberrations of structure, function and metabolism, thereby contributing to dys- function and disease. Almost certainly to be included among these harmful factors are the deformation of nerves and roots, such as com- pression, stretching, angulation and torsion that are known to occur all too commonly in the human being and that are likely to disturb the interaxonal transport mechanisms, intraneural microcirculation and the blood-nerve barrier. Neural structures are especially vulner- able in their passage over highly mobile joints, through bony canals, intervertebral foramina, fascial layers and tonically contracted mus- cles. Many of these biomechanically induced deformations are of course subject to manipulative amelioration and correction.41


This survey touched on some of the many ways in which soft tissue dys- function may impinge upon the economy of the body as a whole. Soft tissue manipulation is an important diagnostic and treatment modal- ity and should be considered an integral part of the practice of any physician or practitioner whose intent is to care for the whole person. Although a great variety of assessment, diagnostic, and treatment proce- dures exist, there are common threads that transcend their differences.

## 387CHAPTER 48 Spirituality, Religion, and Healing

to spiritual traditions (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, etc.) and the practices that arise from the cultures and communities surround- ing these traditions. In contrast, spirituality is a much more amorphous term that has been used increasingly in many societies by people who may be uncomfortable with the “institutions” of organized religions but still seek a sense of wholeness, connection, or simply peace in their lives. Spirituality, then, depends on a variety of beliefs concerning the soul, theology, ritual, culture, and so forth. Within specific traditions, there are differing definitions. This might include “being saved” (Evangelical Christian), “submission” (Islam), or “nonattachment” (Buddhism). To favor the idea that one of these concepts is the “truth” is to endorse certain spiritual viewpoints while dismissing others. Given the world’s spiritual diversity, each view must be interpreted within the context of its a particular tradition. These traditions share the fundamental goal of giving meaning to the experience and concept of spirit, but each has unique perspectives and values. This creates challenges for the study of spirituality and health, especially in multicultural societies. In the West, the default response has been to either follow Christian theology or to make definitions that are often secular and less specific to any one religious tradition. These definitions are more “transcendental” in scope and seek to make all humans and human behavior spiritual rather than allowing for specificity in religious expression based on the individual patient. These definitions tend to make the meaning of spir- ituality “fuzzy” or even “vague and contradictory.”5,6 This also conflates spiritual, religious, and psychological factors, reduc- ing the validity of the terms—such as when a psychological factor like optimism is used as a “spiritual” metric. This can confound results and become tautological. If, however, the meaning of research terms varies from common use, the results may lack ecological validity. These chal- lenges can be seen in the common complaint that very spiritual people are somehow “better” than others or that one must be spiritual to be ethical or compassionate. Broad definitions that universalize spirituality can be espe- cially damaging in pluralistic settings, such as in science and multicultural contexts. To remedy this, we recommend distinguishing between religion and spirituality.7 For some, all spiritual beliefs and practices are completely within the framework of their religion. For 20% to 30% of Americans, spirituality is largely outside religion.8,9 A Pew survey found that 24% of Americans say they go to the religious services of at least one faith other than their own. Spiritual and religious pluralism is the norm for many places in the world, especially the United States.10,11 Although Christianly still dominates the American scene, there are other growing and powerful influences shaping American religious heterodoxy, such as the spiritual traditions of Asia, principally Buddhism and Hinduism (especially medi- tation and yoga), Islam, and nonreligious spiritual-like experiences.

# WHY RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY ARE

# IMPORTANT IN HEALTH CARE

It is likely that among our Neolithic ancestors there was little distinc- tion between spirituality and physical healing. Most tribal societies involve shamans in healing, even of the physical body. Most major healing traditions also postulate and have a close connection between the spiritual and physical bodies in their treatment models.12 The separation between spirituality and health care is largely a modern, Western phenomenon. Although the advent of the scientific method has created break- throughs in evidence-based health care, the consequence for conven- tional medicine is a lack of emphasis on context in any given treatment. The research on “complementary and integrative medicine” and “optimal healing environments” has demonstrated the need for better attention to whole-person health care that has only recently started to return to the healthcare system.13,14 In contrast, systems of Eastern medicine, such as Ayurveda or the chakra system in India, acupuncture or tai chi in China, and meditation or singing bowls in Tibet (to name a few), regularly incorporate priests, sha- mans, or spiritual healers together with prescribed treatments and rituals to address not only the symptoms but also the root of the disease itself.15 Just as a psychologist might ask probing questions to understand the cause of one’s mental distress, in many parts of the world, disease may not only be a physical problem but a result of spiritual misalignment or dis-ease. Within a Christo-centric framework, science in the West has sought to distance itself from such a model, for fear that assigning spiritual val- ues to a physical problem may result in the outdated and even danger- ous conflation of placing responsibility for illness on the patient or the patient’s “sins.” This, of course, can lead to ostracization or even mal- treatment from a medical perspective, which we indeed must try to avoid. However, what if one’s religious or spiritual beliefs do not include the concept of sin? In a Buddhist or Hindu context, one’s disease might have much more to do with karma, a concept that assigns no more responsibil- ity to an individual than the act of being born! Of course, once one has a disease (much like karma), it is possible to do something to treat it, which must occur by addressing not just the symptoms of the illness but also the whole person, and that is where spirituality and ritual become important. More and more, the defining “spiritual” experiences of people in the West stem from adopting the religious practices of other traditions, such as yoga from Hinduism or meditation or mindfulness, which largely came to the United States from the Buddhist tradition. Because Buddhism is a nontheistic religion (that is, it does necessitate a belief in God), spiritual Westerners find it particularly appealing, and mindful- ness has found large applications as a primarily nonreligious spiritual practice. It is important to remember, however, that these now secu- larized practices have spiritual and even religious roots.16 Therefore what “spiritual” means to any one patient can vary widely and has great implications for health care. For example, one might identify as Jewish or Christian but may not be able to readily assume the rituals, practices, or even belief system based on these identities alone. Patients want greater attention to spirituality when they are in the hospital. A 2003 survey of more than 1,700,000 patients, involving 33% of all US hospitals, showed that patient satisfaction with the emotional and spiritual aspects of care had some of the lowest ratings and was an area in great need of improvement.17 The Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation requires all hospitals to have a process and place to assess the “spiritual health” of all patients. This is usually done by tak- ing some sort of “spiritual history”18,19 (discussed later in the chapter). Prayer is a common practice in the United States and is often directed toward health concerns. A national survey in 2004 revealed that 35% of respondents used prayer for health concerns; 75% of these prayed for wellness, and 22% prayed for the healing of specific medi- cal conditions. Of those praying for specific medical conditions, 69% found prayer very helpful. Factors independently associated with the increased use of prayer included age 33 to 53 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.6), age more than or equal to 54 years (OR, 1.5), female sex (OR, 1.4), and education beyond high school (OR, 1.5). Patients with depression, chronic headaches, back and/or neck pain, digestive problems, and allergies were also associated with more frequent prayer. Only 11% of respondents described using or discussing prayer with their physicians. Most people in the United States believe that spirituality can pow- erfully affect human health and want physicians to include faith as part of a comprehensive doctor–patient interview20: • A Gallup poll published in 1990 found that 94% of patients admit- ted to hospitals stated they believed that spiritual health is as important as physical health, 77% believed that physicians should consider their spiritual needs as part of their medical care, and 37% wanted their physician to discuss their religious beliefs more.21

## 388SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

• A telephone survey conducted in 2002 found that 80% of respon- dents believed God acts through physicians to cure illness; 40% believed God’s will was the most important factor in recovery; and 69% said they would want to speak to someone about spiritual con- cerns if seriously ill, although only 3% would initiate a conversation about spiritual factors with a physician.22 Even outside of a faith tradition, nonreligious spirituality is used in finding meaning, whole-person healing, and the cultivation of caring patient–provider relationships. It seems clear, then, that spirituality, in its various manifesta- tions, such as religion, prayer, rituals, meditation, meaning and pur- pose, exceptional experiences, and behavior, is a core component of holistic health care. An individual is not only a body but also a spiritual being. Caring for the whole person, then, requires that we ask about and work with the spiritual dimension of health care. But what does this mean in daily practice? How do we address spiritual- ity in routine health care? When is it most needed, and who should provide such care?

# RESEARCH ON RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL

# PRACTICES AND HEALTH

The scientific research on religion, spirituality, and health is a growing field. There are measures for spiritual belief, practice, and experience, as well as research linking spirituality and health.23,24 However, the subjective nature of spirituality and the inability to randomize patients to most spiritual practices require correlative and mixed-methods approaches for their evaluation, including systematic qualitative research. The following is a brief summary of research on spiritual- ity, religion, prayer, and the effects of intention and selected “biofield” practices common in spiritual practices.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Health Effect of Religious and Spiritual Practices

There is considerable research showing that participation in religious and spiritual activities, including churchgoing, Bible study, prayer groups, rituals (both community and private), or other behavior ori- ented to a “higher being” or “God,” correlates with health outcomes. Summaries of these studies have been done by a number of scholars, such as Harold Koenig, Larry Dossey, Daniel Benor, Stephan Schwartz, Marilyn Schlitz, Wayne Jonas, and others. My colleagues and I exam- ined this research extensively and published a critical appraisal in the book Healing, Intention and Energy Medicine: Science, Methodology and Clinical Implications, from which a summary is provided for this chapter.25 Nearly 200 studies examining the health effects of religious and spiritual behaviors on various conditions and outcomes have been published. Most of this research shows that religious practices are associated with beneficial effects on health. This includes reduced mortality, improved physical health and quality of life, and reduced mental illness and drug abuse. More than 75% of these studies report statically significant effects on those associations. Few studies report (or even measure) the adverse effects associated with religious prac- tices. The vast majority of this research is epidemiological. This blunts the certainty of these associations because multiple confounding fac- tors besides religious behavior, such as changes in diet, lifestyle and behavior, social connections, and risk and resilience factors, are hard to control. These confounding factors cannot be randomly distrib- uted, but they can be approximated with control comparisons and analyzed.

## Intercessory and Healing Prayer

There are a few studies of prayer—defined as healing intention or appeals toward a “higher being or force.” Most of these studies examine if health outcomes changed compared with no or less prayer. A review was conducted by John Astin, who focused on randomized studies of distant healing and prayer for clinical conditions. Astin’s review included a total of 13 randomized studies on prayer involving patients. Of these, six (46%) reported statistically significant effects of prayer on at least one outcome and a mean effect size across trials of 0.30, which is considered small in most clinical research. The research had an average quality score of 45% of the maximum using a standard quality score for controlled studies.26 No effects at this level of evidence were reported for the healing of warts or for alcoholic relapse in a small trial.27 Four more randomized, controlled trials were published after this review. One was positive, and three reported no significant effects from distant prayer.

## “Bioenergy” Healing Research

What is often called “energy healing” involves the intentional direc- tion of spiritual “energy” or a hypothesized “biofield” toward a patient, with the goal of improved health. A review of clinical studies of energy healing was conducted by Sara Warber, MD; Gaia Kile, MSN, NP; and Brenda Gillespie, PhD, of the University of Michigan. The review focused on randomized controlled trials of clinical conditions treated with these energy methods. Nineteen randomized controlled trials involving 1122 patients were included. All but one were on Therapeutic Touch—a semiformalized process used by nurses and others in which a practitioner holds his or her hand over the patient. Eleven (58%) of the studies reported statistically significant effects, with a mean effect size of 0.60—a moderate effect. Positive effects were found for the alle- viation of pain in burn patients and reduced anxiety in institutional- ized elderly patients. There have been more than 50 studies published on laboratory models of energy research involving mainly cellular and animal models. Although much of the findings are reported as positive, an overview shows no studies that were independently replicated at this time.

## Qigong

Qigong is an ancient energy healing method developed in China that claims to accumulate and direct this energy, which is called “qi.” Although a vast amount of Chinese literature exists, it is difficult to evaluate because it is mostly in Chinese. We examined both clinical and laboratory studies of “external qi” (qi projected from a practi- tioner). The evaluation of clinical studies also captures qigong prac- tice, or “internal qi” (qi cultivated by meditation and exercises). In the latter, we focused on blood pressure because this area has the largest amount of evaluable literature. A review was conducted by Michael Mayer, PhD, OMD. Thirty-three controlled studies (out of 72 reports) on the effects of qigong on hypertension were reviewed. All studies reported positive effects, but only five of the studies were randomized. However, the quality of the research was poor (quality score of 13% of maximum). No high-quality replications were done. One study reported adverse effects. A review of the laboratory (cell and animal) studies of qigong was done by Juliann Kiang, PhD, and Ping Y. Lu. Kiang and Lu sorted through studies from multiple databases (including those in Chinese). Fifty-eight studies (out of 130 reports) had enough detail to review. Studies reported positive effects on a variety of outcomes, including cancer growth and cellular and enzyme changes and immune mod- ulation, in both animals and cell culture. However, the quality of the research was poor (quality score of 20% of maximum), and there were no independent, high-quality replications. Significant publication bias is likely in both the clinical and laboratory studies because pos- itive studies are published much more often than studies showing no effects.28,29

## Direct Effects of Intention

There are many studies, including high-quality, independent repli- cations, examining the effects of intention on biological and physical parameters. One set of studies examines if a person can affect the con- ductivity of the skin of another person using mental intention. Another body of research involves examining whether people can alter chance events (e.g., the throw of a die or an electronic random event genera- tor [REG]) by intention. In both these sets of research, there is a clear and highly statistically significant effect of intention on the outcome. Intention clearly has direct effects on a number of parameters. However, these effects are small (often less than 5% difference from controls). Although these studies have proven that intention does have effects, how these studies relate to prayer and other spiritual practices is unclear.

## The Effect of Healing in a Clinical Setting

What is the effect of having a spiritual healer as part of medical prac- tice? Two studies have been described by Tim Harlow, MBchB, DCH, and one study was described by Harald Walach, PhD. Initial observa- tions indicated benefits from introducing healers into a clinic where controlled assessments of healing effect were performed. A healer was brought into the conventional practice without compromising conven- tional medical care or altering the healer’s methods. The healer resulted in an improvement in the symptoms and well-being of some (but not all) of the chronically ill patients and changed the perceptions and behavior of doctors, other providers, and patients about spiritual heal- ing. Physicians took more time to listen, and patients communicated more often about the complementary therapies they were using. In a study by Harald Walach, PhD, 12 chronically ill patients offered distant healing had improved quality of life compared with those not treated by healers. This effect was significant, both statistically and clinically. When including these additional quality criteria, the evidence level is B because no high-quality meta-analysis or independent replication has been done.

## Advancing Research on Spirituality and Health

There is clearly a need for further research on the relationship between religion, spirituality, and health. But advancing the field is complex. Not only do concepts and definitions in spirituality and healing vary widely, but the models of research used for more tangible constructs often do not provide a good fit with the subtle aspects of spirituality, such as meaning, transcendence, the sacred, prayer, holiness, and so forth. Although measures of spiritual experiences and religious prac- tice have been developed, these may not capture the meaning of faith for many people. Dr. Chris Feudtner, a palliative care pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, has designed a thoughtful model of research allowing fluid “mediation between domains,” both the concrete and fluid concepts in spirituality in health.30 In summary, there is evidence to suggest that mind and matter interact in a way that is consistent with the assumptions of distant heal- ing. Mental intention has effects on nonliving random systems (e.g., random number generators) and may have effects on living systems. Although conclusive evidence that these mental interactions result in the healing of specific illnesses is lacking, further quality research should be pursued. For further information, there are a number of ref- erences providing details on any part of this analysis.31

# WHO PROVIDES SPIRITUAL CARE?

With the separation of the spiritual and physical in modern medicine and the decline of formal religions in the West, the role of spiritual care has been distributed across a wide variety of groups. Although spiri- tual healing, prayer groups, meditation, and other faith-based prac- tices continue to be widespread, modern professional spiritual care has been largely consolidated in clinical pastoral care providers. Before 1906 and what was called the Emmanuel Movement, psychotherapy was part of the domain of both ministers and physicians. However, after the emergence of psychotherapy as a formal discipline, the prac- tice of psychotherapy was formalized under the medical domain, and chaplains wanting to do psychological counseling were required to get special training and certification in that skill.32 During this time, for- mal hospital chaplaincy and clinical pastoral education (CPE) emerged as the professional certification for min isters. Those with CPE training are now hired by hospitals specifically to provide spiritual care services. They largely deal with providing spiritual support and care in areas such as depression and pain, dealing with anxiety and anger, coping with the effects of treatments, and dealing with loss and death.33 Although ministers have denominational training, CPE provides skills for dealing with multidenominational, multifaith, and even non- religious beliefs and contexts. Care of hospital staff to assist in coping with stress, burnout, and traumatic experiences is also a frequent role of hospital chaplains. Chaplains also have a role in assisting with ethical decisions in health care. Challenging treatment decisions and withdrawal of treat- ment in seriously ill patients and differences in opinions between fam- ily members or between medical professionals and family members all may require spiritual discernment and assistance from chaplains. However, medical personnel often do not know how or when to use chaplains in these decisions. Whereas 88% of healthcare providers say that chaplains should be on hospital ethical committees, for example, only 22% to 32% of those committees actually appoint chaplains.34 Recently, organized educational courses have emerged to help health- care professionals learn how to better deal with religious and spiritual issues and how to work more closely with chaplains in health care. Those wanting to learn how to work more closely on these issues would be wise to take such training. One of the most fully developed is the yearly course conducted by Dr. Christina Puchalski, founder of the George Washington Institute of Spirituality and Health (GWish), which provides a comprehensive introduction to team-based spiritual and healthcare integration.35 Faith communities have often been integral to the provision of health- care, from Catholic and Jewish hospital systems to community-based multidenominational groups seeking to address poverty, housing, food insecurity, safety, and other social determinants of health. Recently, the National Academy of Medicine convened a workshop to explore novel faith–health community collaborations addressing population health delivery. The workshop (1) provided an overview of faith-based assets in communities and their relationship to population health and the work of health improvement, (2) highlighted areas where faith-based health assets are using evidence to inform their work and demonstrating effectiveness in improving health outcomes, (3) provided examples of effective partner- ships involving faith-based health assets, and (4) shared lessons learned from working with faith-based assets that could contribute toward princi- ples for engagement of healthcare organizations and public health agencies. Here, a prominent body is giving space, time, and thought on how the gap between medical care and faith care could be better filled.36 Those wanting to affect public health and the “upstream” determinants of health and dis- ease could do so by getting more involved in these community–healthcare collaborations.

and teams described previously? How can they bring in the mental and spiritual aspects of a patient’s life without going beyond their professional domain of providing medical care? One approach is to conduct an “integrative health” visit. Integrative health (IH) is the coordinated intersection of conventional care, complementary med- icine, and self-care. The goal of IH is to move from the former to the latter by providing the dialogue and support to help a patient to become engaged in self-care in a rational and evidence-based way. The IH visit starts by asking the patient to describe “what matters” to him or her in life and reflect on what he or she most lives for. What gives the patient meaning, purpose, and joy in life? It is by connecting “what matters” to “what’s the matter” that patients both begin and sustain their healing journey. I do this with two tools that get at this very “existential” (shall we say “spiritual”) dimension of a person. The first tool is the Personal Health Inventory (PHI). The PHI is a simple two-page questionnaire given to patients before a visit. It asks them to state what is most important to them in their lives and then to rate (on a scale of 1 to 5) where they are and where they are ready to change in three other domains that determine health: behavioral, social, and emotional and environmental. The PHI sets the stage for a dialogue during the integrative visit to discuss all the domains of healing of a person. Fig. 48.1 shows the elements of the PHI. The second tool is used during the visit. It is called the HOPE Note. HOPE stands for Healing-Oriented Practices and Environments, and the tool is designed to elicit more details of the patient’s personal determinants of health and start a Personal Health Plan (PHP). HOPE asks questions about lifestyle (diet, activity, sleep, stress man- agement); the social and emotional dimension (social support, lone- liness); the mental and spiritual dimension (mental attitude; goals and joys in life); and the external environment (exposure to beauty, art, and nature). The discussion seeks to link the mental and spiri- tual dimension to the other healing pathways of a person. Table 48.1 shows the questions of the HOPE Note.37 This approach allows a holistic assessment of the individual in an everyday office visit. From this, the patient’s needs and wants can be taken into account and merged into the patient’s own personal health plan. From that point, support in the patient’s healing journey is provided to actualize the plan. This provides truly patient-centered care. Such care requires a team that includes expertise in medicine, social determinants, lifestyle and behavior change, and spiritual care. It also includes the patient and family members as part of the team.

# CONCLUSIONS

The mental and spiritual dimension is a core part of all human beings. As such, any healthcare system or provider that seeks to care for the whole person needs to address this dimension. We know that patients need and want to address spiritual issues when they are ill. We know that there is evidence for the reality and effectiveness of spiritual prac- tices on health outcomes. There are professionals and groups trained and prepared to assist in helping patients with religious and spiritual needs. Tools and training are available to bring the mental and spiri- tual dimension into the practitioner’s daily encounters with patients. Thus it is important for all physicians and other healthcare providers to address the core dimension of spirituality in their practice.

# HISTORY

<!-- chunk -->

## Contributions and Influences From Antiquity

There were a variety of strands of medicine that came together at the crossroads of Islamic history that proved to be of tremendous signifi- cance for the birth of Islamic medicine in general and for Unani med- icine in particular.6 First, there was the synthesis of the ancient sciences (including medicine) of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations in Greek life and thought, centered in Alexandria. Only in the light of recent archeological and anthropological discoveries have we discovered the high level of scientific sophistication that was present in these two king- doms. The medical knowledge attributed to these earlier civilizations became forged in the fire of the Greek intellect into an even more sys- tematic model of diagnostics and therapeutics. Second, the main centers of Greco-Hellenistic learning were pushed farther East as a result of a decline of intellectual energies due to shifting political and economic realities constantly confronting and fracturing Western Christendom. This encouraged two other civiliza- tions to take up the reins of the transmission of essential elements of Greek knowledge: Persian and Harr ā nian (i.e., Sabaean). The Sabaeans were independent heirs to the Babylonian and Greek scientific estates through their reliance on the wisdom contained in Hermeticism and neo-Pythagoreanism. Also, it was in the city of Jundishapur that the Persians vivified the sciences coming out of India and China. In summary, the “scientific knowledge that originated in India, China, and the Hellenistic world was sought out by Arab and Muslim scholars and then translated, refined, synthesized, and augmented at different centers of learning, starting at Jundishapur in Persia around the 6th century—even before the coming of Islam—and then moving

## The Torchbearers of Islamic Medicine

With the advent of the Islamic spiritual tradition, one must mention the intellectual power and genius found in the physicians of Islam. For if history did not give birth to these giants in the field of medicine, one could not really speak in the present tense at all of contemporary Unani medicine, let alone its subtle historical influences on the charac- ter of modern conventional medicine.

Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn ibn ‘abd All ā h ibn S ī na was born in the city of Bukh ā ra in what is today Uzbekistan. He was the preeminent physi- cian of his time, earning the epithet of “Prince of Physicians.” He began studying medicine at the precocious age of 13, became a physician at years of age, attended to kings and princes at 18 years of age, and was appointed as court physician to the ruler of a Persian province at 20 years of age. His literary corpus includes Kit ā b as-Shif ā ’ (The Book of Healing, which was primarily a text of encyclopedic proportions on medicine and philosophy) and al-Qan ū n fi ‘l-Tibb (The Canon of Medicine, a one-mil- lion-word text summarizing the entire Hippocratic and Galenic tradi- tions and describing the Syro-Arab and Indo-Persian medical practices of his time). The Canon quickly was, for several hundreds of years, the standard medical textbook of the Islamic, medieval Christian, and later Indo-Pakistani worlds. Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was “a five-vol- ume compendium of Greek and Islamic healing that became one of the principal textbooks in European universities centuries later.”9 It is from this remarkable polymath that Unani medicine draws its breath of life. Avicenna is perceived by some to be the “father of Unani medicine,” and his Canon its gospel (Fig. 49.2).3

Abu al-Q ā sim al-Zahr ā w ī (976–1013 ad) is considered to be the greatest surgical figure in Islamic medicine. He was also original in this medical arena in inventing and manufacturing the requisite sur- gical instrumentation that did not exist, or existed previously in very crude form only, to conduct operations as painlessly and effectively as possible. Some of these instruments of surgery have not changed sig- nificantly in design for more than 1000 years. A more comprehensive sketch of the significance of Albucasis in the field of surgery can be found in Kasule.11 Abu al-Wal ī d Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Rushd12 (1126–1198 ad) was born in Cordoba, where he trained in law and philosophy, although he made his living as a physician. He wrote his Kit ā b al-Kulliyy ā t (the Latin translator’s Colliget, The Book of General Principles) in which he covered the whole field of medicine in abridged form (Fig. 49.3).

Isma’ ī l Sharaf al-D ī n al-Jurj ā ni followed Avicenna by one generation, producing the most important medical encyclopedia in the Persian language, the Zakhira-i Khwarizmshahi (Treasury Dedicated to the King of Khwarazm). The size, as well as the style of the work, places it between Avicenna’s Canon and Rhazes’s Continens. Muhammad Husayni Nurbakhski was a physician of 15th-cen- tury Safavid, Persia, who wrote a large medical work entitled The Quintessence of Experience. He was the first person to identify and treat several common diseases, including whooping cough. The 16th and 17th centuries were the major centuries in which Islamic medicine spread into India and came to be known as al-Tibb al-Yun ā n ī (Unani medicine). One of the major patrons of the medical arts in India during this time was Dara Shuk ū h, a Mogul prince who was also a Sufi and a student of the Vedanta. ء Ayn al-Mulk al-Shir ā z ī was responsible, at least in large part, for composing The Medicine of Dara Shuk ū h, which is the last great medical encyclopedia written in the world of Islam.

# METAPHYSICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL

# FOUNDATIONS

Unani medicine’s philosophical underpinnings are tied to the Islamic spiritual tradition. The true and original meaning of the word philos- ophy as philo-sophia (“love of wisdom”) has only accidental affinities to what is termed philosophy in the modern lexicon today. Traditional philosophy as philo-sophia was, and still is, tied to a spiritual vision of humanity and the cosmos.

<!-- chunk -->

## Epistemology and Ontology

Epistemology and ontology deal directly with the nature of knowl- edge—what something “is,” how it is obtained, and its methods of use—and the study of existence or “being,” respectively. Because Unani medicine is rooted in the Islamic tradition, it is from this spir- itual source where one must search for the answers to the questions regarding its theories on knowledge and existence. Within the Islamic world, as well as other traditional religious worlds, knowledge has a definite hierarchical structure.13-15 This hierarchy maintains the essential links that exist between Heaven and Earth, between God and humans. First, there exists an acknowl- edgment of a presiding Divine Knowledge (i.e., God as wise and all-knowing). Following this is the knowledge found in Revelation (i.e., a perfect dispensation from Heaven that enlightens the human intellect).16 As this revelatory knowledge sparks the heart’s depths, it necessarily begins to involve the mind–intellect in its quest for knowl- edge of this earthly domain (‘ilm al-dunya), this physical world. Ontologically, the “being-ness” of humanity is intimately connected with the Being of God. God is seen as the Supreme Being Alone, with- out whom nothing can rightfully claim existence for itself. Thus God’s Being is termed W ā jib al-Wuj ū d (“Necessary Being”). In this light, humanity—and everything else in the world of forms—is seen as “bor- rowing” its existence from the indispensable nature of Divine Being.

## Cosmology and the Human Microcosm

The basic cosmologic premise in Islam, as well as in other traditions such as Hinduism, Christianity, and Judaism, is that the Absolute Truth of Divinity (al-Haqq) manifests Itself in the world of forms and within the human heart in a process called the “arc of descent.”17 There is in response to this arc of descent of the Divine a reciprocal “arc of ascent” of the human spirit.18 These adw ā r (“arcs” or “cycles”) of descent and ascent relate directly to the interdependence of all things on all levels of existence. Everything in creation is perceived as acknowledging, in one form or another, the all-pervading Divine Presence. From the tradi- tional view, the human being is seen as the most concentrated theoph- any (i.e., a locus of Divine Presence in the world of forms), especially as it concerns the qualities of an active intellect and free will. According to the Hermetic dictum, “As above, so too below,” the human being acts as a mirror to the Divine. Furthermore, the Sufis (the mystics of Islam) have a popular saying that addresses this reality on the cosmic scale: al-ins ā n qawn sagh ī r wa ‘l-qawn ins ā n kab ī r (“The human is a small universe, and the universe is a large human”).

## 396SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

The guiding principle of the dynamic interplay between the Divine Order and the rest of creation is called Tawh ī d (“the principle of Divine Unity”). All of the traditional sciences in Islam agree that there exists a dependence of creation on the Divine, an interdependence between all forms in the cosmos, and an intradependence of all ele- ments within each specific form. There is an obvious analogy to the profound knowledge found in that sacred oriental symbol of the Tao’s tai chi (“Supreme Principle of Unity”) with the complementing and harmonizing forces of yin and yang. This is also known in Islamic cos- mologic language as al-wahdah fi ‘l-kathrah wa ‘l-kathrah fi ‘l-wahdah (“the one in the many and the many in the one”). Unani medicine bases its medical theories of diagnosis and treat- ment on this specific understanding of the intradependent relation- ships that exist between the four humors as it concerns the subtle (lat ī f) aspects of human physiology and spiritual psychology (Fig. 49.4).19

## Teleology and Spiritual Correspondences

The teleological component of Unani medicine’s philosophy entails extracting “meaning” and “purpose” in relation to the realities of cre- ation and the human experience. To what end is human life? What is the goal of all of creation? Is there a plan or purpose that governs the created order and all of its particular elements? The Qur’ ā n explicitly states that inna li ‘Ll ā hi wa inna ilayhi r ā ji’ ū n (“Verily we belong to God, and to Him is our return”). The human race hurls itself forward, in time and space, toward an inevitable reunion with its Creator. It is this understanding of the nature of things that permits traditional hak ī ms (the “doctors” of the Unani medical tradition) to find solace in the fact that every patient is ultimately a patient at the doorsteps of the Divine Doctor. The notion of forcing “heroic” measures upon the sacred human frame is problematic to the philosophical principles upon which Unani medicine is based. This is not to say that surgery and trauma care are perceived in a negative light in Unani medicine. Rather, the question is really one of proportions. The traditional Tab ī b (“man of medicine,” or physician) always has an eye to the Divine within the human temple. This is really a cultivated virtue that the hak ī ms practice as part of their art to remain true to the doctrine that “God is everywhere present”; that in keeping with the wisdom of Plato, it is the “eye of the soul” that witnesses “t ō Agath ō n” (“the Supreme Good”). Therefore any decision made by a hak ī m must include an analysis of the risk-to-benefit ratio within the larger ethical framework of the Divine’s presence in human life. As a prayerful supplication of ء Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and the spiritual pole of Shiite Islam, says: Y ā man Ismuka daw ā ’, wa dhikruka shif ā ’ (“Oh Ye whose Name is a sacred medicine, and in whom remembrance of Thee [dhikruka] is a healing balm … ”).

# UNANI MEDICAL THEORY IN PRINCIPLE

<!-- chunk -->

## Vis Medicatrix Naturae

It is only with the “eye of the heart” (ayn al-qalb) that the doctors of Unani medicine are able to gain proper intuition of vision con- cerning the state of the jism al-lat ī f (the “subtle body”) of the patient in whom is found the flowing, dynamic streams of the humors. It is at the level of the subtle body that the hak ī m desires to enliven the self-healing power, the vital force, or the vis medicatrix naturae to affect a change in the patient’s being in the direction of health and wellness. It is this particular “organizing principle” (al-quwwa al-mudabbirah), as a component of the hidden physiology of the subtle body, that affects a harmonizing reaction in the face of “dis- ease” or illness. One may perceive the vis as being the thread that holds the fabric of the human body, mind, and soul together in close conjunction with the spirit. This is the general medical theory of the “healing power of nature” that Unani medicine posits as a guiding principle, on which is built more complex specific understandings of human health and disease.

## A Personal Thought on the Invisible Vis or Quwwa

We encounter many opportunities in life that allow us to witness obvious demonstrations of the vis medicatrix naturae. An everyday example of the obvious workings of the vis is a paper cut. Many of us have had this experience and have considered it a very irritating situ- ation. However, if we look carefully at what is actually happening, we cannot but assume that the “natural healing instinct” in the human body, when undergoing injury or trauma, is to mobilize mechanisms that will allow for self-preservation and homeostasis, which would be disorder and chaos. Why should the body even mobilize these mechanisms to begin with? We know to a great degree the science behind these mechanisms, but what we do not know is why these mechanisms should initiate such a nonentropic response. This is still a mystery. As simple as a paper cut is, it is usually followed by a natural biochemical and physiological inclination toward wound healing (homeostatic repair). We usually never see a paper cut to a finger pro- gressively develop into an open wound, fester with pus and infection, turn gangrenous or necrotic, and die, necessitating amputation of the finger; this is simply not the natural, instinctual response of the human body. In actuality, what we do see happen is the influence of this orga- nizing principle—call it what you may: qi, prana, vis, quwwa, ki, and so forth—leading the organism’s biochemistry toward a healing homeo- stasis, not a death-inducing “diseased” disturbance. There is yet another common example that relies heavily on the signaling of this “power” or “quwwa” for healing, and that is surgery. How many times have we heard what surgeons say after surgery? It usually goes something like “Well, it’s now up to the patient to heal” S A N G UI N E C H O L E RI C P H L E G M A TI C M E L A N C H O LI C Touchy Aggressive Excitable Changeable Impulsive Optimistic ActiveQuiet CalmLeadership STABLE UNSTABLE I N T R O V E R T E D E X T R O V E R T E D Carefree Lively Easygoing Responsive Talkative Outgoing Sociable Even-tempered Reliable Controlled Peaceful Thoughtful Careful Passive Unsociable Reserved Pessimistic Sober Rigid Anxious Moody Restless

or “I’ve done all I can; the rest is up to the patient” or “I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up to see how you’re healing.” What do statements like this really mean? I believe that what is actually being invoked is a subconscious acknowledgment of and reliance upon the vis. However, because the language of modern conventional medicine does not give this ever-present healing power a name, it is vicariously mentioned under ambiguous terms, phrases, and allusions. All other traditional systems of medicine in the world have a name for this “ele- phant in the room” as a distinct reality.

## The Doctrine of the Seven Naturals

There are hosts of medical systems around the world with their own understanding of what constitutes the primary and basic functional components that cause health to reign or disease to take root, prog- ress, and finally manifest in constellations of signs and symptoms of illness. In Chinese medicine, we have physiological concepts such as qi, blood, yin, and yang. In conventional medicine, physiology is dominated by the key concepts of organic issues relating to organ tissue morphology (anatomy) and fluid dynamics (medical biochem- istry; Fig. 49.5). In Unani medicine, these concepts fall under the strict heading of um ū r al-tab īء iyyah (“principles of natural physiology”), comprising the “Seven Naturals” that are the pillars and determinants of health. These are as follows (Fig. 49.6): Elements (ark ā n) Temperaments (miz ā j) Humors (akhl ā t) Organs (a ء d ā ’) Forces, drives, faculties, or powers (quww ā t) Actions or functions (af ءā l) Pneuma or spirit substance (r ū h)

<!-- chunk -->

## Elements, Qualities, Properties, and States

The elements are the simple building blocks of matter in nature, including the human body. They are nondivisible, but they do have qualities that are both active and passive that determine the states of matter. They are as follows: Fire (n ā r), which is hot and dry (h ā r and y ā bis): determines the ener- getic state. Air (haw ā ’), which is hot and wet (h ā r and ratab): determines the gas- eous state. Water (m ā ’), which is cold and wet (b ā rid and ratab): determines the liquid state. Earth (ardh), which is cold and dry (b ā rid and y ā bis): determines the solid state. These elements do not mean literally clods of dirt, buckets of water, and so forth. “Likewise, the burning fire that we see is not the element fire, which is really the potentiality of fire within the substance.”20

<!-- chunk -->

## Temperaments

The interplay between the qualities of the elements leads ultimately to a uniform configuration of a temperament. “Each [Temperament] is named after a certain Humor, and is characterized by the predominance of that Humor and its associated basic qualities.”21 The classical temperaments correlate well to today’s psychological constitutional types: choleric, melan- cholic, phlegmatic, and sanguine. Imbalances of temperaments cause dis- harmony, especially on the mental and emotional fronts. The following is a concise, but thorough medical depiction of the temperaments (Table 49.2).

## Humors

There is no doubt that the principle of the humors (Akhl ā t) originated with the “father of medicine,” Hippocrates, describing it in his book entitled Tab īء at al-Ins ā n.22 He observed upon examination of blood

that the red portion of fresh blood is the blood humor (Dam; corre- sponding to the sanguinous temperament), the white material mixed with blood is the phlegm humor (Balgham; related to the phlegmatic temperament), the yellow-colored froth on top is the yellow bile humor (Safra; corresponding to the choleric temperament), and the heavy part that sediments down is the black bile humor (Sauda; related to the melancholic temperament).20 It is important to realize that the humor associated with the blood and called “sanguine” is not identical with the blood drawn by phle- botomy. Nor is the phlegm the same physical phlegm produced by the lungs. Cameron Gruner, MD, called them “quasi-material,” or what some have termed “semi-gaseous vapors.”20 Similarly, qi is beyond physical or corporeal form. Qi and the Seven Naturals are really and truly best understood as a “formless substance,” often referred to in the language of philosophy as a Platonic “form” or “idea.”23 Ultimately, it is understood that true “health is a harmony of [these] humors.”20

<!-- chunk -->

## Organs

The organ component in the doctrine of the Seven Naturals is actually very straightforward. There are four primary organs that the rest of the organs support and whose work they may enlist. These are as follows: Heart: the seat of vital power and heat Brain: the seat of sensations and movements Liver: the seat of all vegetative, nutritive, and eliminative powers Gonads: the seat of generative capacity for reproduction of the species The medical traditions of antiquity all agree that when consider- ing an approach that is centered on health, wellness, and prevention, the two most important organs to focus emphasis on are the liver and the colon. Modern medicine focuses its emphasis on the heart and the brain, for good reason. “Miracles” occur every day in emergency rooms, operating rooms, trauma care facilities, burn units, first-line responder ambulance services, life flight transportation services, etc. “In fact, emergency medicine is one of the most legitimate and impres- sive achievements of [modern] orthodox medicine.”20

<!-- chunk -->

## Forces, Energies, Faculties, Drives, or Powers

The groundwork energies that animate the Seven Naturals are termed forces or faculties (quww ā t). These forces are the legitimate activating principles for the functioning of the humors. Without the quww ā t, there would be no accomplishment of organ function or of anything else. There are primarily three faculties that give rise to a variety of functions. These faculties are: Natural (as in “from the world of nature”) or vegetative faculty (quw- wah tab īء iyyah): governs the nutritive power of the liver and repro- ductive powers of the generative organs. Vital or animal faculty (quwwah hayw ā niyyah): responsible for pre- serving the integrity of the vital force. Psychic or soul faculty (quwwah nafs ā niyyah): controls the brain and the rational faculty. “It is of significance to note that in Arabic as in many other languages the words for breath (nafas) and soul (nafs) are related. Therein lies a profound cosmological principle which is also related to the invocation of the Name of God (dhikr) as the central technique of Sufism for spiritual realization.”4

<!-- chunk -->

## Actions or Functions

Functions or actions (af ءā l) are the manifesting activities of the previ- ously mentioned humoral and organ powers. The functions ultimately are the by-products of the will or power of the humors and organs. For example, the heart’s function is to beat; the stomach’s function is to receive food and drink and prepare them for further digestive pro- cessing; the brain’s function is to allow for reception of stimuli, with higher functioning allowing for the expression of reason and thought.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pneumata or Spirits

The spirit (R ū h) is the otherworldly vehicle for the transmission of that divine spark of life force, a heavenly command that “descends upon this mixture of the humors and which is the subtle body standing intermediate between the physical body comprised of the humors and the force of life which comes from the world above. It is worth drawing attention to the similarity between the words r ū h (spirit) and r ī h (the wind or air) in Arabic.”4 The spirit or r ū h in its medical sense is, according to Muslim phys- iologists, and following Galen, of three kinds: Vital Spirit: hot and dry; has its center in the left ventricle of the heart; preserves life; causes the body to grow, move, and reproduce; and travels within the arteries. Psychic Spirit: cold and wet, has its center in the brain, causes sen- sation and movement, and moves within the nerves. Natural Spirit: hot and wet; has its center in the liver; is concerned with the reception of food, growth, and reproduction; and travels within the veins.4 Thus there is an association between physical health and spiritu- ality. “According to some of Avicenna’s writings, and in keeping with the Hermetic Tradition, Avicenna sees these natural laws as embody- ing a component of Divine creative perfection, which to him explains the tendency inherent in natural systems to direct themselves toward a point of … equilibrium.”24 Another aim toward understanding the physiology and pathology of the doctrine of the Seven Naturals involves answering the question “to what end?” The answer to this has to do with achieving a healthy constitution for every patient by meeting the goals of the six essential causes (of health; al-asb ā b al-sittah al-dhar ū riyyah)22: • Air • Food and drink • Body movement and repose • Mental movement and repose • Sleeping habits • Retention and evacuation It is these basic causal pillars that ultimately guide the hak ī m toward satisfying the criteria for health as set forth by Avicenna himself in his Canon of Medicine, which are as follows25: • The complexion of an individual is pleasing, with shades and color that are normal to the individual’s respective biological environment. • Body build is medium, neither too lean nor too heavy. • Hair is not too profuse nor scanty. • The feel of the body is balanced in respect to heat, cold, moisture, and dryness. • Sleep and wakefulness are moderate. • Movements are free and easy. • Intellectual functions and memory are good. • Habits and behavior are balanced between timidity and assertive- ness, anger and calm, leniency, humor, pride, and humility. • Growth and repair are rapid, whereas deterioration is slow. • Dreams are interesting and pleasing. • Food is enjoyable. • Food is digested and assimilated normally. • Excretory functions are regular.

## Pulse

<!-- chunk -->

## 401CHAPTER 49 Unani Medicine

Quality of impact (strong, weak, moderate) Duration of cycle (fast, slow, moderate) Duration of pause (successive, different, moderate) Between beats (full, empty, moderate) Compressibility (hard, soft, moderate) Pulse perspiration (full, empty, moderate) Regularity Order and disorder (ordered, irregular, irregularly disordered) Rhythm (similar, different, out of rhythm) Avicenna’s pulse diagnosis was so profound that he even “recog- nized ‘physiological psychology’ in treating illnesses involving emo- tions. From the clinical perspective Ibn Sina developed a system for associating changes in the pulse rate with inner feelings which has been viewed as predating the word association test of Carl Jung. He is said to have treated a seriously ill patient by feeling the patient’s pulse and reciting aloud to him the names of provinces, districts, towns, streets, and people. By noticing how the patient’s pulse quickened when names were mentioned, Ibn Sina deduced that the patient was in love with a girl whose home Ibn Sina was able to locate by the digital [pulse] examination. The man took Ibn Sina’s advice, married the girl, and recovered from his illness” (Fig. 49.7).26

## Uroscopy, the “Urine Wheel,” and the “Alvine Discharge”

<!-- chunk -->

## (Fig. 49.8)

Unani medicine demonstrates sophistication in realizing that there is much legitimate insight and wisdom to be gained through the macro- scopic study of urine (often termed uroscopy) and stool. These tissues of the body reveal indices of the body’s internal metabolic terrain and activity. For example, “urine wheels” were used by hak ī ms to forward assumptions about diagnosis or prognosis, treating urine essentially as a “liquid window through which physicians felt they could view the body’s inner workings.”27 “Laboratory medicine began 6000 years ago with the analysis of human urine, which was called uroscopy until the 17th century and today is termed urinalysis. From ancient times until the Victorian era, urine was used as the primary diagnostic tool. Physicians spoke of urine as a ‘divine fluid’, or a window into the body. Babylonian and Egyptian physicians began the art of uroscopy. Uroscopy, from the word ‘uroscopia,’ means ‘scientific examination of urine.’ The word is derived from the Greek ‘ouron’ meaning ‘urine’ and ‘skopeo’, meaning to ‘behold, contemplate, examine, inspect.’”27 Building on the uroscopy and medicine of Galen, “Theophilus Protospatharius, a seventh century physician, wrote De Urinis. This manuscript from Byzantium was the first publication exclusively on the subject of urine.”27 It was later used in the system of Unani medi- cine and translated for use down through the European Middle Ages. In Avicenna’s system of urine inspection, “important points to be considered in using urine in diagnosis are color, density, turbidity,

sediment, quantity, froth, and odor.”25 Of course, one can quickly see allusions in these criteria to even modern macroscopic urinaly- sis. However, even collection techniques were considered. “Ismail of Jurjani, an 11th century physician, recommended collecting the full amount (of urine) over 24 hours in a large clean vessel and keeping it out of the sun or heat, which could alter color. Ismail also recognized that food and aging altered urine, and required a good night’s sleep and empty stomach before collection. He wrote about this in what became the most comprehensive instructional book on urine collec- tion and examination”27 of his time. Stool analysis and the patient’s history of bowel movements were also tools used by hak ī ms that allowed for the responsible investi- gation into the possible causes of illness. Stool has “certain charac- teristics vis-à-vis color, odor, volume, and consistency,” 22 whereas bowel movement history includes “time, duration, and frequency of defecation.”22 Just to give a brief example, differing stool colors approximate dif- fering illnesses and imbalances of humors. Hakim Moinuddin Chishti summarized this category of investigation by what stool color signifies from an Unani medicine point of view in his book’s section called “The Alvine Discharge”20: • White stool: an obstruction of the passages carrying bile; is seen with jaundice. • Red stool: reveals the crisis point of a disease. • Black stool: means high oxidation; maturing of a disease caused by imbalance of the black bile humor; bad sign; presence of blood in small or great quantities, which is a sign of diseases of the liver, intestinal ulcer, or rupture of internal vessels. • Green stool: indicates diminished internal heat. • Yellow stool: sign of the imbalance of the yellow bile humor (at the onset of illness); is a sign that the body is eliminating harmful substances (at the resolution of an illness). • Multicolored, pus-filled, sticky stool: very grave sign of the degen- eration of internal organs.20

## The Practice Framework

Because of the obvious difficulties that confronted personalized phy- sician-to-patient travel and care, Avicenna drew up plans on the cen- tralizing and standardizing of medical operations for the masses in hospitals. “These hospitals kept records of all their patients and their medical care, something done for the first time in medical history.”26 “From the tremendous impetus of advancement of medicine sup- plied by Avicenna, the Arabs took the huddled masses of sick and established them in sleek and elegant hospitals. Their hospitals were immense structures with courtyards and had features such as lecture halls, libraries,26,28 mosques and chapels (they treated people of all reli- gious beliefs), charity wards, kitchens, and dispensaries. All patients were attended by qualified male and female nurses. The mood at the magnificent Mans ū r Hospital of Cairo is reflected in the following account of the amenities arranged for the benefit of all patients: ‘Day and night, fifty reciters intoned the Qur’ ā n aloud. At nightfall, musicians played soft melodies to induce drowsiness in the patients. Professional storytellers entertained the sick with their tales. When the patients left the hospital, they were given enough money so that they would not have to resume work immediately.’”20 Furthermore, even before Avicenna’s lifetime and progressive influence, “there was a separate hospital in Damascus for lepers, while, in Europe, even six centuries later, lepers were condemned and burned to death by royal decree.”26 The Bimaristans (hospital systems) and smaller “mobile hospitals,” which could possibly be regarded as the first ambulances in the world, dedicated to serving under times of civil or community distress, urgency, or emergency,26 were complex in structure and function.

## Therapeutic Modalities

The bridge of therapies, in time and space, between Unani medicine and North American holistic and naturopathic medicine had much to do with the cross-pollinating of research, scholarship, practice, and politics of Europe’s (especially old Germany’s) “back to nature” movements, which made the trans-Atlantic shift and became rooted in the medical movements known as Eclectic Medicine,29 Thomsonian Medicine, the American Medical School of Vitalism (which was philo- sophically opposed to scientific materialism30), and the Nature Cure,31 wherein, like Unani medicine, “the patient is kept close to nature during illness.”22 Examples of this North American connection with Unani medicine are found in the lives of personalities such as Nicholas Culpeper,32 Benedict Lust, Henry Lindlahr, or William Kellogg, along with their applied therapies. “By the time of the early eighteenth century, the Tibb system was the basis of virtually all medicine in the civilized world, having been translated and formed as the basis of the work of such men as Father Sebastian Kneipp (1821–1897) and Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), the founder of homeopathy, who is reputed to have known Arabic and read Avicenna’s works.”20 In this regard, it is important to remember that historically (Fig. 49.9): The practical approaches of the Greeks and Romans were the antecedents of the 19th century nature cure pioneers. They were the only forms of medicine available, and, to this extent, naturopathic and orthodox medicine had what Saks describes as “a relatively undifferentiated past.” Indeed, both schools of medicine claim Hip- pocrates as their progenitor. There is no doubt that Hippocrates set many of the principles we hold dear as naturopathic physicians; in particular, the concept of the healing power of nature ( … vis med- icatrix naturae) … Hippocrates advocated dietary adjustments,

fasting, physical therapy, rest, and herbal medicines, but even he and his followers were not above using chemical drugs.33 For those who perceive that there is no doubt of Hippocrates’s influence on setting the practical and theoretical standards for con- temporary naturopathic medicine, then it must hold true that by direct historical relevance—and all that has been stated previously in this chapter regarding this—naturopathic medicine is without ques- tion an offspring of the life and thought of the “prince of physicians,” Avicenna. It was Avicenna, with his singular intellect, who synthesized and expanded upon all who came before him in his Canon and other works and who handed down humoral medicine, along with its practi- cal therapeutics, to generations of physicians after him. In the late 1950s, a small group of BCNO (British College of Natu- ropathy, now formally recognized as the British College of Osteo- pathic Medicine) graduates, medical herbalists, and homeopaths formed the Research Society for Naturopathy to explore a wider range of treatment modalities. They ran seminars on such topics as humoral therapy … 33

## Food-Based or Dietary Therapies

The objective of dietary therapy ( ء il ā j bil ghida) is to properly regulate a patient’s appetite, in terms of quality or quantity, to maintain the balance of the humors and strengthen the vital force. This is accom- plished by prescribing patients food-based protocols, such as restric- tion, fasting25,34 (which is an effective, natural process of detoxification and healing25), liquid diets, excess eating, semisolid diet, bland diets, and so on.22 Attention should be paid to the seasons and the require- ments of the body in relationship to the environment as to what foods to recommend, depending on the “degree of effectiveness of types of cereals, of leguminous plants, vegetables, root crops, fruits, types of meat, types of milk, of honey and sweet-meats, of water, of drinks, and [edible] aromatic herbs.”8 Ultimately, “food is one of the most potent and yet safe instruments of establishing balance in a disturbed organism.”25 This is in line with the Hippocratic proclamation, “Let food be your medicine and medi- cine be your food,” as well as conforming to the first principle of ther- apy, which stipulates “first do no harm.” “It is not accidental that the Andalusian physician Ab ū Marw ā n ibn Zuhr in the 12th century wrote the first scientific work on diet ever composed, the Kit ā b al-Aghdiyah (“The Book of Diet”).”4

## Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and the Black Seed

Historically, and as far as pharmacology and the materia medica is con- cerned, among the Arab inheritors of Greek knowledge and wisdom, “it is sufficient to say that Dioscorides was indisputably the greatest authority, that his work was many times translated and elaborated”8 by scholars such as al-Biruni, Ibn-Bajjah (Avempace), and al-Idrisi (the famous geographer whose maps purportedly influenced the maritime travels and adventures of Christopher Columbus; Fig. 49.10).35 The predominant therapeutic modality in Unani medicine is with- out doubt ء il ā j bil daw ā ’ (pharmacotherapy). Raw materia medica resources for this therapy came from the plant (90%), mineral (5%), or animal (5%) kingdoms. As Khan noted, “in treatment the principle that each human being is a reflection of all creation is followed by using a whole range of substances.”25 Some examples of Unani medicine phytotherapy include the con- ditions and their respective remedies shown in Table 49.3.

## The spiritual lore and medicine of the black seed. There is no

doubt that the most well-known herb used in Unani medicine, and revered by the cultures of the Middle East and Asia, is the black seed (al-habba al-sauda, or al-habba al-barakah [“the black seed” or “the seed of grace”]). It also goes by the scientific name Nigella sativa (Fig. 49.11).36 The Prophet of Islam specifically mentioned the black seed as he exhorted members of his community to “Use the black seed, which is a healing for all diseases except al-S ā m, and al-S ā m is Death.”37 With such a pronouncement, one may infer that the prophet was the proto- typic hak ī m. This observation is important to note because more than 1.6 billion people in the world follow, as closely as possible, the life and thought of the prophet of Islam. Thus the prophet’s statement regarding the black seed elevates and ennobles this plant beyond its investigated scientific benefits. However, it was posited that “advancements in the methods of analytical chemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and microbiology, etc. have led to the discovery of many active principles of the N. sativa [seed] such as nigellicine, nigellidine, nigellimine-N-oxide, thymo- quinone, dithymoquinone, thymohydroquinone, nigellone, thymol, arvacrol, oxy-coumarin, 6-methoxycoumarin, and 7-hydroxy-cou- marin, alpha-hedrin, steryl-glucoside as well as rich amounts of

## Environmental Regimens

There are primarily three regimental therapies22 to take advantage of as part of Unani’s movement and manual medicine approach (Fig. 49.12): • Activity (riy ā dh ā t), which usually means some form of voluntary movement or exercise with the purpose of achieving the following: • Organs that perform their functions efficiently • Better absorption and assimilation of food and nutrition • Clearing of pores in the skin • Removal of waste products through the lungs • Strengthening the physique • Massage (tadl ī k), which is physical pressure and movement given by another through gentle or aggressive touching, moving, or rub- bing of muscles and soft tissues for the purpose of achieving the following: • Bracing the body • Relaxation response • Decreased body fat • Enhanced circulation • Good organ function • Thermarium baths (hamm ā m ā t), which are found around the world. These baths sometimes contain mineral constituents (e.g., sulfur) that leech out of the terrestrial basin holding these waters; the benefits of these hot baths include the following: • Releasing waste products and impurities through the skin • Reducing the viscosity of the humors • Reducing obesity Of these regimental therapies, it is without a doubt the thermo- hydrotherapeutic hamm ā m (the thermarium) that many people may be acquainted with. The hamm ā m is probably more familiar to Western ears as the “Turkish Bath.” Worldwide today, there are many medical and recreational resort facilities that incorporate traditional baths of this nature in cavernous, underground, or open-air commu- nal systems. What follows is an average description of a hamm ā m experience39: Traditionally the hamm ā m is made up of a number of chambers with domed white roofs. The “istir ā ha” is the “rest salon,” where visitors are received and un-robed. The inner sanctum of the ham- m ā m is usually set down from the istir ā ha, with further descents into the various steam rooms. The walls of the steam rooms are custom- arily made from hajar habash (a black stone) which holds heat for a long time. Once you have achieved a good sweat [ta ء r ī k], you then proceed on to another warm room where the hamm ā mi greets you. The hamm ā mi is the person who cleans or exfoliates your body and gives you a [vigorous] massage. One person commented, “I was pummeled, stretched, twisted like a pretzel, and scrubbed with a floor-like brush for about an hour.” However, you do emerge glow- ing and gleaming with your metabolism raring and your fat cells pummeled and detoxified. Finally, you are returned to one of the outer chambers, wrapped up in a robe, and led to a cubicle to rest and relax and enjoy mint tea or juice.39 History records that knowledge of the “medical benefits of the hamm ā m dates back to 200 B.C. when Hippocrates stated, ‘Give me the power to create a fever and I shall cure any disease.’ Essentially, the steam bath induces a hyperthermia, which raises the body tem- perature above normal. Hyperthermia stimulates the immune system by increasing production of antibodies and interferon (an antiviral protein with cancer fighting capabilities). A good healthy sweat can help relieve pain and stiffness of joints and muscles, treat respira- tory problems like sinusitis, and ward off symptoms of colds or flu. It is also excellent for detoxification, and especially in conjunction with massage it can reduce cellulite by releasing toxins from fat cells. Also, increased blood flow stimulates metabolism and rejuvenates the skin.”39 In the West, “hydrotherapy enjoyed a great resurgence in 18th and 19th century Austria and Germany, and was a key part of Father Sebastian Kneipp’s system of natural therapeutics, which went on to become the basis for Naturopathy. For example, in many European countries that have hot springs or spa resorts, [hydrotherapy] treat- ments are a recognized subspecialty of medicine.”40

## 405CHAPTER 49 Unani Medicine

Abu al-Q ā sim al-Zahr ā w ī (known to the West as Albucasis), who was one of the greatest surgeons of antiquity that “took surgery [jarh] out of the hands of barbers and put it into the realm of scientific medi- cine”8; and images of surgical interventions involving hemorrhoidal correction, bone-setting, reductions of dislocations of joints, dental procedures (“Muslim physicians would even make false teeth from the bones of animals4), and so forth.4 “Surgery was also used by the Arabs to correct cataracts.”41 Many hak ī ms accept the fact that today, it is probably best to tri- age the surgical option for patients to surgeons who have been edu- cated and trained in modern medical schools. The same would hold true for cauterization (kay; healing through heating or burning of tis- sue), which today is accomplished with the help of lasers, bloodletting (fas ā d; releasing of venous blood to purge toxic or disturbed humoral physiology), and leeching (ta ء l ī k; the use of leeches to evacuate “cor- rupt” blood).42 Other therapies, such as cupping (hajam ā t) and cathartic colonic purgatives (ish ā l), are often used hand in hand as supportive or adjunct therapies to surgery as well.

## Pneumatology, Wellness, and the “Infallible Remedy”

Hak ī ms were often part of guilds, craft orders, or philosophical schools of thought that were supported by influential political or religious lead- ers of their time. Also, these guilds were mostly attached to one of the many mystical brotherhoods of Islam, known as Sufi Tar ī qahs (which were spiritually or esoterically oriented “Paths” or “Initiatic Orders” leading to God, realization, and enlightenment for the aspirant).43 A hak ī m (male doctor) or hak ī ma (female doctor) was usually invested in practicing more than just his or her medical science but also turning his or her mind, soul, heart, and spirit toward heaven in pursuit of the perfection of the virtues. The very word hak ī m has as its etymological basis the linguistic root reference in Arabic to someone’s attainment of spiritual hikmah (wisdom, sagacity, or saint- liness) through the practice of the virtues. These virtues are such things as beauty of character; wisdom; respect and compassion for all of creation; charity through self-sacrifice and altruism; and most important of all, constant “remembrance” (dhikr) of God as Divine All-Possibility. In this light, there is a natural concern and goal on the part of the hak ī m for improving the lot of patients in regard to their mental and emotional well-being, not just caring and tending to the health of the physical body. Unani medicine doctors have always known that wellness is a state of wholeness, a wholeness that cannot be learned through an academic investigation of health and disease. True wellness is a state of total sat- isfaction and contentment, a state of understanding that everything is as it should be (otherwise, metaphysically speaking, God would not be God, and we would not be we). Hak ī ms teach that wellness can be approached through various life lessons, experiential methods, and psychospiritual disciplines. Lao Tzu explained that “at the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are, and you know what you want.”42 The hak ī m will often prescribe a variety of treatments with guidance (“huda”)—when tending to the soul of a person—by precipitating in the patient a pro- found desire to be a more “balanced, emotionally stable, and success- ful individual who is able to make better decisions and realize better achievements in life.”26 This is accomplished through the practice of pneumatology (traditional psychospiritual counseling and healing), which includes some of the following subjects: Prayers (personal, supplicatory, or intercessory)44 Meditation (fikr), with breath and sacred sound45 Contemplation or intellection (tasawwur bil ء aql)46 Dhikr (remembrance through repetition of a sacred formula or Divine Name): This would be very similar to the “Jesus Prayer” or the “Ave Maria” within Orthodox and Western Christianity, as well as the tradition of Japa Yoga within Hinduism. Recitation of holy scripture: “The Qur’an in its totality, and certain sections and verses in particular, is curative of serious conditions not amenable to other forms of treatment. The methods of using the Qur’an are many: Ta ء w ī dh (“seeking refuge from harm or evil” with God), Da ء wah [“supplication for help from God”], and Ruqya [reciting sacred verse to a sick person].”25 Solitude in nature: We should remember the contemporary resurgence of the direct healing power of nature in the movement of eco-psy- chology and all that it has to offer. Visualization47 Music therapy: “In addition to baths, drugs, kind and benevolent treatment given to the mentally ill, music therapy and occupational therapy were also employed. These therapies were highly devel- oped. Special choirs and live music bands played daily to entertain the patients by singing, music, and other light-hearted perfor- mances.”26 Forgiveness for self and others48 Elimination of unhealthy and disturbed attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors, such as “arrogance, pride, self-deception, lack of con- centration, giddiness, frivolousness, irreverence, degrading others, forgetfulness, fear of failure, hypocrisy, excessive emotionality, severe anger, and being inconsiderate.”45,49 Philosophical counseling50,51 Making pilgrimages to local and international holy sites or cities such as Jerusalem, the Ka ء ba, Benares, Angkor Wat, the shrine of our Lady of Guadalupe, Lourdes, Mt. Shasta, Mt. Fuji, and so forth52

## The “Infallible Remedy”

The “Infallible Remedy” is the recitation, in the original sacred Arabic language, of the first chapter of the Noble Qur’ ā n 41 times for 40 days during the interval between the obligatory canonical dawn prayer and the optional prayer immediately after it. “The Prophet said: ‘In S ū rat al-F ā tihah there is a balm for all ailments.’ He went on to provide the specific instructions for utilizing this most treasured remedy … The accumulated experience of the Sufis confirms that the reading and reciting of S ū rat al-F ā tihah with true faith and sincere conviction, cures all maladies, whether spiritual or worldly, external or internal … The Companions [of the Prophet] used to read it for treatment of diseases, both physical and men- tal.”45 If, for whatever reason, one cannot accomplish this level of intensity or precision in the recitation of the opening chapter of the Holy Qur’ ā n as methodically instituted and practiced by the Prophet of Islam himself, then “simply recite 11 times: Bismi Ll ā h ir-Rahm ā n ir-Rah ī m [‘In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.’].”45 The opening chapter of the Qur’an is in Arabic, translated and transliterated. This allows those who do not read Arabic to simply pronounce the words and phrases and thus benefit from the sacred sonorous quality of the recitation as it surrounds and penetrates the human body and its immediate environment with theurgic energy and influence from Above (Fig. 49.13).

## 408SECTION 3 Therapeutic Modalities and Practice Specialties

• There was a system for the inspection of drugs and pharmaceuti- cals—the equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration— in Baghdad 1000 years ago. • The European system of medicine was based on the Arabic system, and even as recently as the early 19th century, students at the Sorbonne had to read the Canon of Avicenna as a condition for graduating. • Unani-Tibbi hospitals were, from the beginning, free to all without discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, ethnicity, or social sta- tus. • Unani-Tibbi hospitals allocated different wards for each classifica- tion of disease. • Hospitals had unlimited water supplies and bathing facilities. • Before the advent of the printing press, there were extensive hand- written libraries in Baghdad (80,000 volumes), Cordova (600,000 volumes), Cairo (2 million volumes), and Tripoli (3 million vol- umes). • All Unani-Tibbi hospitals kept patient records. • A hospital was established for lepers. As many as six centuries later in Europe, they were still burning lepers to death by royal decree. • In 830 ad, nurses were brought from Sudan to work in the Qayrawan hospital in Tunisia. • A system of fountain-cooled air was devised for the comfort of patients with fever. • Avicenna described the contamination of the body by “foreign bod- ies” before infection, and Ibn Khatima also described how “minute bodies” entered the body and caused disease—well in advance of Pasteur’s discovery of microbes. • Al Razi was the first to describe smallpox and measles. He was accu- rate to such a degree that nothing has been added since then. • Avicenna described tuberculosis as being a communicable disease. • Avicenna devised the concept of anesthetics. The Arabs developed a “soporific sponge” (impregnated with aromatics and narcotics and held under the patient’s nose), which preceded modern anesthesia. • The Arab surgeon Al Zahrawi was the first to describe hemophilia. • Al Zahrawi was also the first surgeon in history to use cotton, which is an Arabic word, as a surgical dressing for the control of hemor- rhage. • Avicenna accurately described the surgical treatment of cancer, say- ing that the excision had to be radical and remove all diseased tis- sue, including amputation and the removal of veins running in the direction of the tumor. He also recommended cautery of the area if needed. • Avicenna, Al Razi, and others formed a medical association for the purpose of holding conferences so that the latest developments and advancements in the field of medicine could be debated and passed on to others.53 So it seems ironic that “what began as an advanced medical system that set world standards has now come to be regarded as a system of folk medicine. This decline coincided with the decline of the Islamic Empire and the dissolution of the Caliphate, as these were directly responsible for the direction and impetus of Islamic scientific scholars in all fields.”41 The decline of this ancient system of medicine also proves, if proof be needed, that “the achievements of the Unani-Tibbi practitioners of today bear little resemblance to those of their illustrious predecessors, and some of those claiming to practice traditional medicine are woe- fully ill-equipped”41 to do so. Most individuals passing themselves off as Unani practitioners today would be labeled by most knowledgeable persons as folk healers or country herbalists, but not hak ī ms of the Avicennan type. Today, it is in the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent or, more generally speaking, the sub-Himalayan regions of the Orient, that Unani med- icine continues to thrive as a living school of medicine, competing with three other systems of health care: Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and modern Western medicine. Although current, mod- ern “Western antipathies to things-Arabic and Muslim”54,55 seem to have stalled the advance of Unani medicine into the stadium of complementary and alternative therapies in the West, it is slowly and gradually gaining ground as an optional healthcare system for many patients. In India, the government has set up a Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, which also has a licensing system for traditional practitioners.41 India has 18 colleges of Unani medicine, about Unani hospitals, and nearly 1400 beds for inpatients. In addition, there are nearly 900 dispensaries of Unani medicines and about 30,000 reg- istered practitioners. In India alone, the number of persons serviced by Unani medicine is estimated to be at least 23 million from more than 220 villages.56 Unfortunately, the details of the overall medical situation in Pakistan and other countries are not as well known or are simply not available.57 One commentator wrote, “Since both Ayurveda and Greek Medicine are constitutionally based, it’s not surprising that improv- ing basic constitutional strength, resilience and resistance to disease should be a very important therapeutic objective in both systems. The methods and modalities employed are also quite similar: diet is first and foremost, followed by simple herbal remedies, lifestyle modifi- cation, massage and bodywork, hygienic purification treatments and exercise/gymnastics/yoga. Being humor-based, both systems consider self-poisoning, or auto-intoxication with toxic metabolic residues and superfluous morbid humors to be the primary cause of all disease and pathology, for which they prescribe various hygienic purification treatments and regimes. The Ayurvedic word for toxins, “ama” means, “crude” or “raw”—residues from faulty or incomplete pepsis that hav- en’t been properly integrated into the body and its functioning, and therefore impede it. The word ama has its equivalent in the word ‘cru- dities,’ a common term for toxins in Greek Medicine.”58 In the humble opinion of this author, there is no better time than the present for discovering the beauty, mystery, and power of Unani medicine. This gift from the East—along with Ayurveda and tradi- tional Chinese medicine—will reveal itself to serious seekers as a very real healthcare option offering natural, safe, and effective approaches to healing.

Sometimes physiologic fever is coincident with such disturbances, but according to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) this type of fever “constitutes a deep spiritual cleansing causing ‘the sins to fall off like leaves being shed from a tree.’ These fevers burn off impurities on the soul level.” 50. “In ancient and pre-modern times, people saw the practical value of philosophy as a guide for living. . . But then, in the early 1980’s, German philosopher Gerd Achenbach decided to revive the old and time-honored practice and offered his services as a philosophical counselor for those seeking to solve their problems philosophically. In 1982, Achenbach founded the Society for Philosophical Praxis to establish philosophical counseling as a profession. Praxis is a Greek word meaning the practical application of a branch of learning—in this case philosophy—to solve life’s problems. In classical Greek astrology and counseling, Praxis also refers to one’s career, life path, or calling. Helping clients find their career or life path is a specialty of philo- sophical counseling.” For further information about this technique of counseling, see Osborn. 51. Osborn D.

# Pharmacology of Natural

# Medicines

Careful review of the scientific literature reveals a considerable amount of research documenting the clinical efficacy, phar- macological activity, and toxicology of numerous “natural” medicines. An important purpose of this section is the crit- ical evaluation, from a scientific standpoint, of the historical and clinical use of natural medicines, especially botanicals. Although plants have been used as medicines since antiquity, appreciation of them as effective medicinal agents was greatly diminished until the later part of the 20th century. It is hoped that this section will further revive the appreciation for and the safe and effective use of botanical medicines. Some plant constituents are discussed as separate entities, and for several botanicals, these constituents may be the most appropriate therapeutic substances. However, we believe that the whole herb should be used whenever possible. Many studies have demonstrated that, in many instances, the physiological and pharmacological effects of a particular plant constituent are diminished when it is given as an isolated component rather than in its naturally occurring environment. Furthermore, besides synergistic and enhancing effects, there appear to be factors in most plants that prevent many of the adverse effects of isolated plant constituents. In understanding the pharmacology, pharmacognosy, and historical use of plants, the student of natural medicine is once again inspired by the miracle of nature as well as the intuition and empiri- cism that ancient herbalists possessed. We hope that this section will help better inform our readers of the impressive uses, and potential dangers, of these natural medicines. We also want to stress that botanical medicine should not be used simply as a substitute for the drugs commonly used to treat disease. The true physician of natural medicine will use them as part of the treatment of the whole person and in the context of addressing the causes of the disease and promoting health, not simply treating symptoms. Finally, considering the unfortunate, continuing trend of forever-increasing use of prescription drugs—and in too many instances polypharmacy with unpredictable results (especially in the elderly)—the astute physician of natural medicines needs to be expert in the potential for interaction between natural and conventional medicines. These interactions can take many forms, such as enhancing or inhibiting: a drug’s rate of absorption, the intended pharmaceutical effects, the rate of detoxifica- tion, and so forth. Far more research is now available on drug–herb–nutrient interactions than when the first edition came out in 1985. Almost every natural medicine covered in this textbook now has a robust drug interactions subsection.

Cholagogue: a compound that stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder. Choleretic: a compound that promotes the flow of bile. Cholestasis: the stagnation of bile within the liver. Cholinergic: mimic the action of acetylcholine affecting the parasympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system and the release of acetylcholine. Coenzyme: a necessary nonprotein component of an enzyme, usually a vitamin or mineral. Compress: a pad of linen applied under pressure to an area of skin and held in place; may include an herbal extract. Decoctions: aqueous extracts prepared by boiling the botanical material with water for a specified period, followed by straining or filtering. Demulcent: a substance soothing to irritated mucous membranes. Emulsify: to disperse large fat globules into smaller uniformly distributed particles that can remain in suspension in water. Enteric coated: a way of coating a tablet or capsule to ensure that it does not dissolve in the stomach so it can reach the intestinal tract. Enzyme: an organic catalyst that facilitates chemical reactions. Essential oils: also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils, or essences. They are usually complex mixtures of a wide variety of organic compounds (e.g., alcohols, ketones, phenols, acids, ethers, esters, aldehydes, oxides) that evaporate when exposed to air. They generally represent the odorif- erous principles of plants. Extracts: concentrated forms of natural products obtained by treating crude materials containing these substances with a solvent and then removing the solvent completely or partially from the preparation. The most commonly used extracts are fluid extracts, solid extracts, powdered extracts, tinctures, and native extracts. Flavonoid: a generic term for a group of flavone-containing compounds that are found widely in nature. They include many of the compounds that account for plant pigments (anthocyanins, anthoxanthins, apigenins, flavones, flavonols, bioflavonols, etc.). These plant pigments exert a wide variety of physiological effects in the human body. Fluid extracts: these extracts are typically hydroalcoholic solutions with a strength of one part solvent to one part herb. The alcohol content varies with each product. They are, in essence, concentrated tinctures, constructed to represent 1 grain of the crude drug to 1 minim of fluid extract. Glycosides: sugar-containing compounds composed of a glycone (sugar component) and an aglycone (non–sugar-containing component) that can be cleaved through hydrolysis. The glycone portion may be glucose, rhamnose, xylose, fructose, arabinose, or any other sugar. The aglycone portion can be any kind of organic compound (e.g., sterols, triterpenes, anthraquinones, hydroquinones, tannins, carotenoids, anthocyanidins). Infusion: tea produced by steeping a botanical in hot water. Laxative: a substance that promotes the evacuation of the bowels. LD 50 : the dosage that will kill 50% of the animals taking the substance. Lipotropic: promoting the flow of lipids to and from the liver.

Native extracts: high-potency extracts prepared via concentration under reduced pressure at low temperatures until all solvent is removed. Oleoresins: primarily mixtures of resins and volatile oils. They either occur naturally or are made by extracting the oily and resinous materials from botanicals with organic solvents (e.g., hexane, acetone, ether, alcohol). The solvent is then removed under vacuum, leaving behind a viscous, semisolid extract that is the oleoresin. Examples of prepared oleoresins are paprika, ginger, and capsicum. Powdered extract: a solid extract that has been dried to a powder. Putrefaction: the process of breaking down protein compounds by decay or rotting. Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): the estimated amount of a nutrient considered to support health. Resins: complex oxidative products of terpenes that occur naturally as plant exudates or are prepared by alcohol extraction of botanicals that contain resinous principles. Saponins: nonnitrogenous glycosides, typically with sterol or a triterpene as the aglycone, that possess the common property of foaming, or making suds, when strongly agitated in aqueous solution. Solid extracts: thin to thick, viscous liquids or semisolids prepared from native extracts by adjusting the latter to the specific strength with suit- able diluents. Typically, these extracts are 4:1, that is, one part extract is equivalent to, or derived from, four parts of crude herb. Standardized extracts: an herbal extract standardized to a defined concentration of a specific compound, usually the one considered most clinically active. Strength: the potency of an extract or the strength of a botanical extract, which is generally expressed in two ways. If they contain known active principles, their strength is commonly expressed in terms of their content of active principles. Otherwise, their strength is expressed in terms of their concentration of the crude drug. Thus a strength of 4:1 means one part of extract is equivalent to, or derived from, four parts of crude drug. A strength of 1:5 represents one part of extract comparable to 0.2 parts of the crude drug. This ratio method of expressing drug strength does not accurately measure potency because there may be wide variation between manufacturers. Tinctures: alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions usually containing the active principles of botanicals in low concentrations. They are usually prepared by maceration or percolation or by dilution of their corresponding fluid or native extracts. The strengths of tinctures are typically 1:10 or 1:5. Alcohol content varies. Tonic: a substance that exerts a gentle strengthening effect on the body.

## 412SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


Onions and garlic, due to their similar constituents, have many of the same pharmacological effects. However, significant differences make one more advantageous than the other in certain conditions. One of the key nutritional qualities of onions is their high con- tent of quercetin. To determine uptake as well as in vivo antioxidant effects of quercetin from onions, six healthy, nonobese, normocholes- terolemic female volunteers participated in a randomized two-phase crossover supplementation trial to compare the antioxidant effects associated with (1) a meal of fried onions, and (2) a meal of fried onions and fresh cherry tomatoes.3 Plasma flavonoids, lymphocyte DNA damage, plasma ascorbic acid, tocopherols and carotenoids, urinary malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine were determined to assess flavonoid absorption and antioxidant efficacy. The results indicated that the flavonoid glucosides (quercetin-3-glu- coside and isorhamnetin-4-glucoside) were significantly elevated in plasma after ingestion of the onion-only meal, and the increases were associated with increased resistance of lymphocyte DNA to DNA strand breakage. A significant decrease in the level of urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine was evident 4 hours after ingestion of the onion meal. After the combined tomato and onion meal, only quercetin was detected in plasma. Endogenous base oxidation was decreased, but resistance to strand breakage was unchanged. No sig- nificant change in the excretion of urinary malondialdehyde occurred after either meal. The conclusions from the study were that both meals—onions and onions with tomatoes—led to transient decreases in biomarkers of oxidative stress, although the biomarkers affected differed. It is possible that the differences in patterns of response reflect the different uptakes of flavonoids, but the underlying mech- anism is not yet understood. Onion has a combination of fructans, dietary flavonoids, and organosulphur compounds with functional benefits against diseases. Some of these benefits are a reduction of blood fibrinogen concentration, the enhancement of blood’s fibri- nolytic activity, antioxidant activity, lipid peroxidation inhibition, a reduction of serum cholesterol, a reduction of respiratory and skin infections, and a decreased risk of diabetes.4

## Antimicrobial Activity

Although onions exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic activ- ity, it is not nearly as potent as that of garlic. This suggests that garlic may be better indicated in cases of infection,5 but onion can usually be con- sumed in larger quantities than garlic, which may increase the concentra- tion of antimicrobial constituents in vivo to approximate those of garlic.


Like garlic, onions and onion extracts were shown to decrease blood lipid levels, increase fibrinolysis, decrease platelet aggregation, and lower blood pressure in several clinical studies.6,7 Onion oil, compared with garlic oil, was a stronger inhibitor of the enzymes cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, which mediate eicosanoid metabolism (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes).8 This suggests that onions would also have a greater effect on inhibition of platelet aggregation and other events mediated by eicosanoids. In addition, extracts of onion have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation via inhibition of diphosphate, epinephrine, arachidonic acid, adenosine, and collagen-induced plate- let aggregation and inhibiting the action of platelet-activating factor.9 Garlic and onion consumption was associated with lower levels of cho- lesterol and triglycerides, as well as an increase in fibrinolytic activity10 (see Chapter 51 for details). Because the quantity of onion consumed in the study cited was so much larger than that of garlic (600 g of onion per week compared with 50 g of garlic), an argument could be made that onion consumption was the major determinant. Onion consumption may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease due to its quercetin content. Epidemiological data suggest that those who consume a diet rich in quercetin-containing foods might have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. In a double-blind, ran- domized, cross-over study, subjects ingested an onion soup containing either a high or a low amount of quercetin. Plasma quercetin concen- trations and platelet aggregation and signaling were assessed after soup ingestion. The high-quercetin soup contained 69 mg total quercetin compared with the low-quercetin soup containing 5 mg total quer- cetin. Plasma quercetin concentrations were significantly higher after AB

the ingestion of the high-quercetin soup than after the ingestion of the low-quercetin soup, and the high-quercetin soup also influenced some aspects of platelet aggregation and signaling.11


Onions were shown to have significant oral hypoglycemic action, comparable to that of the prescription oral hypoglycemic agents tolbutamide and phenformin.12,13 The active hypoglycemic princi- ple in onions is believed to be allyl propyl disulfide, although other constituents, such as quercetin and anthocyanidin, may play a sig- nificant role as well. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that allyl propyl disulfide lowers glucose by competing with insu- lin (also a disulfide) for degradation sites, thereby increasing the half-life of insulin. Other mechanisms, such as increased hepatic metabolism of glucose or increased insulin secretion, have been proposed. In one assessment of the hypoglycemic activity of onion consumption in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the ingestion of 100 g of onion caused a considerable reduction in fasting blood glucose levels by about mg/dL in relation to insulin (145 mg/dL) in patients with type 1 diabetes, and it reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 40 mg/dL compared with glibenclamide (81 mg/dL) in patients with type 2 diabetes, as measured hours later.14 The same dose of onion produced a significant reduction in induced hyperglycemia (glucose tolerance test) by about 120 mg/dL com- pared with water (77 mg/dL) and insulin (153 mg/dL) in patients with type 1 diabetes, and it considerably reduced the glucose tolerance test by 159 mg/dL in relation to water (55 mg/dL) and glibenclamide (114 mg/ dL) in patients with type 2 diabetes, as measured after 4 hours.

## Antiasthmatic Action

Onions have historically been used as antiasthmatic agents. Their action in asthma, as well as in other conditions associated with increased lipoxygenase derivatives (leukotrienes), such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, appears to be greater than that of garlic. The net effect is similar to that of cortisol, which inhibits all eicosanoid metabolism via inhibition of phospholipase. Inhibition of leukotriene formation and onion’s quercetin and isothiocyanate content are likely the primary factors responsible for onion’s antiasthmatic effects. These effects have been confirmed in experimental studies.15,16

## Antitumor Effects

Various forms of cancer are associated with an imbalance between the activities of two enzymes, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) reg- ulate the activity of HDACs and are being used in cancer treatment. Onions have been reported to show potential HDAC-inhibitory activ- ity, exhibiting antitumor effects through the activation of cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and autophagy, angiogenesis inhibition, and mitotic cell death in cancer cells.17 An onion extract was found to be cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and to arrest tumor growth when tumor cells were implanted in rats.18 The onion extract was shown to be nontoxic, with a dose as high as 40 times that of the cytotoxic dose for the tumor cells causing no adverse effects on the host. Another species, Allium ascalonicum (shallots), was shown to exhibit significant antileukemic activity in mice.19 In addition, sulfides found in onions were shown to be effective agents for controlling tumors in both in vitro and in vivo models, and the antitumor effects are likely caused by reversing the antitumor immune system.20 One human study evaluated onion consumption and stomach can- cer in more than 120,000 men and women between 55 and 69 years of age.21 After a 3.3-year follow-up, 139 stomach cancers were diagnosed. The researchers found a strong inverse association between onion consumption and stomach cancer incidence but no association with the use of leeks or garlic.

## Hair Tonic Effects

Topical application of onions has been shown to help alopecia areata, a patchy and nonscarring hair-loss condition. Any hair-bearing sur- face may be involved in alopecia areata, and different modalities of treatment have been used to induce hair regrowth. One study com- pared the effectiveness of topical crude onion juice with tap water in the treatment of patchy alopecia areata.22 The patients were divided into two groups. The group treated with onion juice consisted of 23 patients (16 males and 7 females) ranging in age from 5 to years old (mean, 22.7 years), and the control group consisted of patients (8 males and 7 females) ranging in age from 3 to 35 years old (mean, 18.3 years). The two groups were advised to apply the treatment twice daily for 2 months. Regrowth of terminal coarse hairs started after 2 weeks of treatment with crude onion juice. At 4 weeks, hair regrowth was seen in 17 patients (73.9%). At 6 weeks, hair regrowth was observed in a total of 20 patients (86.9%) and was significantly higher among males (93.7%) compared with females (71.4%). In contrast, with tap water, hair regrowth was apparent in only two patients at 8 weeks of treatment, with no sex differences. These results indicate that crude onion juice can be an effective topi- cal therapy for patchy alopecia areata.

# CLINICAL APPLICATION AND DOSAGE

This chapter highlights the medicinal value of onions, particularly in cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory con- ditions. Onions can be eaten liberally as part of a nutritious diet. Therapeutic dosages in the various forms are typically equal to 50 to 150 g/day of raw onion.


Virtually no reports of toxicity have been documented. However, people with heartburn may note an aggravation of symptoms. One study evaluated symptoms of acid reflux in 16 normal subjects and patients with heartburn.23 Subjects were studied with an esophageal pH probe for 2 hours after eating a plain hamburger and a glass of ice water, and then on another day after an identical meal plus a slice of raw onion. In the patients without acid reflux, ingestion of onions did not increase any of the variables measured (number of reflux epi- sodes, pH less than 4, time of pH less than 4, heartburn episodes, and belches). In contrast, subjects with heartburn experienced a significant increase in all variables. Although the authors of the study concluded that onions could be a potent and long-lasting reflexogenic agent in patients with heartburn, an alternative explanation might be that onions simply improved digestive acid secretion, making the symp- toms of reflux more noticeable.


There are no confirmed drug interactions with onion consumption. Theoretically, because onion consumption may improve blood sugar control, patients with type 2 diabetes taking oral hypoglycemic drugs need to monitor glucose levels because dosage levels of the medication might need to be adjusted.

## 415CHAPTER 51 Allium sativum (Garlic)

In 1721, during a widespread plague in Marseilles, France, four condemned criminals were recruited to bury the dead. The gravedig- gers proved to be immune to the disease. Their secret was a concoction they drank consisting of macerated garlic in wine. This became known as vinaigre des quatre voleurs (“four thieves” vinegar), and it is still available in France today. Garlic’s antibiotic activity was noted by Pasteur in 1858. Garlic was used by Albert Schweitzer in Africa to treat amebic dysentery and as an antiseptic in the prevention of gangrene during World Wars I and II.


Although garlic has a wide range of well-documented effects, its most important clinical uses are in the areas of infection, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular disease.

## Antimicrobial Activity

Garlic has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against many genera of bacteria, viruses, worms, and fungi.4–7 These findings support the historical use of garlic in the treatment of various infectious conditions.

## Antibacterial Activity

Dating back to 1944, studies demonstrated that both garlic juice and allicin inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Brucella, and Vibrio species at low concentrations.7–9 In more recent studies, using serial dilution and filter paper disk techniques, fresh and vacuum-dried powdered garlic preparations were found to be effective antibiotic agents against many bacte- ria, as listed in Box 51.1.4–7,10,11 In these studies, the antimicrobial effects of garlic were compared with commonly used antibiotics, including penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythro- mycin, and tetracyclines. Besides confirming garlic’s well-known antibacterial effects, the studies demonstrated its efficacy in inhibiting the growth of bacteria that had become resistant to one or more of these antibiotics.7 Garlic administration has also been shown to significantly reduce the number of coliforms and anaerobes in the feces.12 One clinical application of garlic’s antibacterial activity may be in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori. A clinical investigation indicated that garlic intake for long durations (years) was associated with a significantly lower average antibody titer. This suggests an indirect inhibitory effect on the reproduction of H. pylori and possibly prevention of more serious peptic ulcer diseases.13

## Antifungal Activity

Garlic demonstrated significant antifungal activity in many in vitro and in vivo studies.4,14–19 From a clinical perspective, inhibition of Candida albicans has the most significance because both animal and in vitro studies showed garlic to be more potent than nystatin, gentian violet, and six other reputed antifungal agents.4,15–17 Although allicin and the volatile oil fraction are clearly the most potent active anti-Candida components,20,21 aque- ous garlic extracts have been shown in vivo to be effective, even at a dilution of 1:100, against the common tinea corporis, capitis, and cruris fungal skin infections.15 One study compared the effects of garlic tablets (1500 mg/d × 7 days) and fluconazole (150 mg/d × 7 days) on Candida vaginitis in 100 married women (aged 18–44 years).22 The results of micro- scopical evaluation and vaginal discharge culture showed signifi- cant differences before and after intervention in both groups, with the overall symptoms of the disease (i.e., redness of the vulva and vagina, discharge, pustulopapular lesions, and abnormal cervix) improving by about 60% in the garlic tablet group and 71.2% in the fluconazole group. In another study at a major Chinese hos- pital, garlic therapy alone was used effectively in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, one of the most serious fungal infections imaginable.18

## Antiviral Effects

Garlic’s antiviral effects have been demonstrated by its protection of mice from infection with intranasally inoculated influenza virus and by its enhancement of neutralizing antibody production when given with influenza vaccine.24 The in vitro virus-killing effects of fresh garlic, allicin, and other sulfur components of garlic were determined against herpes simplex types 1 and 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, vaccinia virus, vesicular sto- matitis virus, and human rhinovirus type 2. The order for virucidal activity was as follows: ajoene > allicin > allyl methyl thiosulfinate > methyl allyl thiosulfinate. Ajoene was found in oil macerates of garlic but not in fresh garlic extracts. No antiviral activity was found for alliin, deoxyalliin, diallyl disulfide, or diallyl trisulfide. Fresh garlic extract was virucidal against all viruses tested. The virucidal activity of commercial products was found to be dependent on their preparation processes. Those produc- ing the highest level of allicin and other thiosulfinates had the best virucidal activity.25 The antiviral activity of an allicin-containing garlic supplement was investigated in 146 subjects randomized to receive a placebo or an allicin-containing garlic supplement, one capsule daily, over a 12-week period.26 The garlic-treatment group had significantly fewer colds than the placebo group (24 vs. 65 patients). The placebo group, in contrast, recorded significantly more days challenged virally (366 vs. 111 patients) and a significantly longer duration of symptoms (5.01 vs. 1.52 days). This study indicates that allicin-containing garlic supplements can prevent the common cold virus.

## Immune-Enhancing Effects

Extensive research has shown that garlic has many immune-potentiat- ing properties, most of which are thought to be due to volatile factors composed of sulfur-containing compounds: allicin, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and others. For example, in vitro studies with alli- cin showed that it stimulated enhanced cell-mediated cytotoxicity in human peripheral mononuclear cells. In animal models, multiple administration of allicin elicited marked antitumor effects via immu- nostimulatory mechanisms.27 Fresh garlic, commercial products containing allicin, and aged garlic preparations have all shown these immune-enhancing properties. Garlic has been shown to enhance the pathogen-attacking activity of T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, which increase the secretion of interleukin and natural killer (NK) cell activity.28–31 The increase in killer cell activity was a remarkable 140% in those who ate the equivalent of two bulbs a day and 156% in those who consumed 1800 mg of odorless, aged garlic. Healthy human participants (n = 120), between 21 and 50 years of age, were recruited for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled parallel-intervention study to consume 2.56 g aged garlic extract (AGE)/d or placebo supplements for 90 days during the cold and flu season.32 After 45 days of AGE consumption, γδ -T and NK cells proliferated better and were more activated than cells from the placebo group. After 90 days, although the number of illnesses was not significantly different, the AGE group showed reduced cold and flu severity, with a reduction in the number of symptoms, the number of days participants functioned suboptimally, and the number of work/ school days missed.

## Anticancer Effects

The famous Greek physician Hippocrates prescribed eating garlic as a treatment for cancer. Animal research and some human studies sug- gest this may have been well-founded advice. It must be kept in mind that much of garlic’s anticancer effect is likely an indirect effect via its effect on the immune system. Nonetheless, several garlic compo- nents have displayed significant anticancer effects, including enhanc- ing Phase II metabolizing enzymes, antioxidant properties, inhibition of the formation of nitrosamines, direct tumor growth inhibition, and the ability to induce apoptosis.33–51 Human studies showing garlic’s anticancer effects are largely based on epidemiological studies.33–37 These studies typically show an inverse relationship between cancer rates and garlic consumption. Human studies have also shown that garlic inhibits the formation of nitrosamines (powerful cancer-causing compounds formed during digestion).47,48


Garlic appears to be an important protective factor against heart dis- ease and strokes via its ability to affect the process of atherosclerosis at many steps (Fig. 51.3). Because there is substantial clinical infor- mation on garlic’s beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, the pharmacology is discussed later in the “Clinical Applications” section.

## Anti-inflammatory Effects

Garlic extract has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity in experimental models of inflammation.2,12 This activity is probably a result of garlic’s inhibition of the formation of inflamma- tory compounds.

parallel-design trial was conducted to assess the anti-inflamma- tory and analgesic effects of a garlic supplement on serum resistin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ) concentrations and on pain severity in overweight or obese women with knee osteoarthri- tis (OA).52 Eighty postmenopausal overweight or obese women (25 ≤ body mass index [BMI] ≤ 40 kg/m2, age 50–75 years) with mild to moderate knee OA were randomly divided into two groups to receive twice-daily garlic tablets (total: 1000 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. At week 12, although serum TNF- α levels did not change significantly within or between the two groups, resistin concentra- tions were significantly decreased in the garlic group (6.41 ± 2.40– 5.56 ± 2.16 ng/mL; P = 0.008). After supplementation, pain scores were also significantly lower in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (5.3 ± 2.3 vs. 6.2 ± 2.5; P = 0.043).

## Hypoglycemic Action

Garlic and onions have often been used in the treatment of diabetes. Allicin has been shown to have significant hypoglycemic action. This effect is thought to be due to increased hepatic metabolism, increased release of insulin, and the insulin-sparing effect.53 The latter mech- anism appears to be the major factor because allicin and other sulf- hydryl compounds in garlic and onions compete with insulin (also a disulfide protein) for insulin-inactivating compounds, which results in an increase in free insulin. Interestingly, when allicin was administered to groups of rats fed a high-fructose diet, the control group that was fed a diet enriched by fructose alone continued to gain weight, whereas the groups fed allicin did not.54 This study indicates that garlic may have some practical use in weight control. Raw crushed garlic has been shown to have beneficial effects in individuals with metabolic syndrome and may be used as an accompa- nying remedy for prevention and treatment. In one study, 40 patients with metabolic syndrome underwent treatment with 100 mg/kg body weight of raw crushed garlic 2 times per day added to a standard diet for 4 weeks.55 Results showed that raw crushed garlic significantly reduced the components of metabolic syndrome, including waist cir- cumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose, and significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

## Miscellaneous Effects

Garlic possesses diuretic, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, and expecto- rant action.1,10 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that fermented garlic extract improved serum of gamma-glu- tamyl transferase (GGT) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in adults with mild hepatic dysfunction.56 It is also a carminative, anti- spasmodic, and digestant, making it useful in cases of flatulence, nau- sea, vomiting, colic, and indigestion.12,57

# COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS

The modern use of garlic primarily features the use of commercial preparations designed to offer the benefits of garlic without the odor. The marketplace is swamped with garlic products, and each manu- facturer claims its product is the best. However, there are vital con- siderations when choosing a garlic product to prescribe. First, if the primary goal is to lower cholesterol or blood pressure, as well as exert immune-enhancing or antimicrobial effect, it is important to ensure that the product provides a sufficient level of allicin. Because allicin is not actually in the product at significant levels, manufacturers often refer to the allicin potential or allicin yield. These terms signify the amount of allicin produced when allinase is activated in the garlic tab- let or powder. The next issue is not so simple to tell from a label. It involves the quality and character of the enteric coating of the tablet. For the allicin to be liberated within the intestinal tract, the tablet must not only be resistant to the stomach’s acid, but it must disintegrate rapidly when it reaches the small intestine. According to research conducted by the renowned garlic experts Lawson et al.,58 when 24 brands of enter- ic-coated garlic were analyzed for tablet dissolution using an approved method (U.S. Pharmacopoeia dissolution method 724A), only one brand released the amount of allicin claimed on the label. The sec- ond-best brand released only 44% of its label claim, and 75% of the brands released less than 10% of their label claim. Failure to deliver an effective dosage of allicin most assuredly does not lower cholesterol or blood pressure. Why so many garlic products fail to deliver allicin is basically due to two major problems. First, many of the garlic products con- tained little alliinase activity. Alliin was found to be plentiful, but because the activity of alliinase was low, the level of allicin formed was also low. Next, many tablets contained excipients (e.g., binders and fillers) that actually inhibit alliinase activity. The alliinase activ- ity in 63% of the brands was less than 10% of the expected activity. The inability to release an effective dose of allicin would explain why so many studies on garlic supplements fail to show benefits in lowering cholesterol or blood pressure.59 For example, studies done transition metal complexation ion channel regulation protein modification signal transduction radical scavenger anti-inflammation

on one particular garlic supplement before 1993 were mostly pos- itive. The results from these positive studies were the main reason garlic supplements have been allowed to refer to cholesterol-low- ering activity in Germany and the United States. However, most studies published since 1995 have failed to show a consistent effect in lowering cholesterol.60–62 Although the authors of the negative studies on garlic believe that the underlying reason for the results was a better-designed study, a more likely explanation is that they were due to a poor- er-quality tablet. Specifically, research conducted by Lawson showed that tablets manufactured before 1993 were twice as resis- tant to disintegration in acid as tablets manufactured after 1993 and that the older tablets released three times the amount of allicin than the more recently manufactured tablets.58 Examination of package labels shows several changes in tablet excipients between the pre- 1993 and post-1993 tablets. Again, these excipients are believed to block allinase activity. Importantly, most studies that show a positive effect of garlic and garlic preparations in reducing cholesterol and blood pressure are those that use products that deliver a sufficient dosage of allicin, other garlic components such as S-allylcysteine, and garlic extracts (e.g., AGE) that protect against atherosclerosis via additional mechanisms, including protection against low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and improvement of endothelial cell function. Kyolic, the AGE manufactured by the Wakunaga Wakunaga Phar- maceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), is a highly standardized AGE produced by extraction and aging of organic fresh garlic, at room temperature, for 20 months. The process increases antioxidant levels and converts allicin to mostly stable water-soluble organosulfur com- pounds, such as S-allylmercaptocysteine and S-allylcysteine. These compounds have high bioavailability and considerable antioxidant effects.63,64 AGE has minimal cholesterol-lowering and antimicrobial effects, but based on good clinical data, it does have antiatheroscle- rotic, antiaging, and anticancer effects. The antioxidant effects of AGE have been shown to prevent LDL oxidation65 and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation via increased nitric oxide production and decreased output of inflam- matory cytokines. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 15 men with angiographically proven coronary artery dis- ease, AGE supplementation for 2 weeks significantly improved brachial artery flow–mediated endothelium-dependent dilation by 44%.66 In a double-blind study of AGE in normal, healthy individ- uals, dosages between 2.4 and 7.2 g/day were shown to produce a dose-dependent selective inhibition on platelet aggregation and adhesion.67 In a 1-year study, AGE was shown to produce a modest reduction in the calcium score of 7.5, determined by electron beam tomography, whereas the placebo group demonstrated an average increase in calcium scores of 22.2.68,69 Epidemiological and animal studies suggest AGE and its organosulfur constituents, such as S-allylcysteine and S-allylmercaptocysteine, have anticarcinogenic effects. Several clinical studies validated an anticancer effect for AGE. In one dou- ble-blinded study in patients with colorectal polyps using high- AGE (AGE 2.4 mL/day) and low-AGE (AGE 0.16 mL/day) doses, in 37 patients chosen as efficacy evaluated subjects, 47.4% (9/19 patients) in the high-AGE and 66.7% (12/18 patients) in the low- AGE group had at least one new adenoma for the first and second interval (0–12 months after intake). The decrease rate of at least one adenoma was 50.0% (7/14 patients) in the high-AGE group for the second interval (6–12 months after intake), whereas there was no decrease in subjects in the low-AGE group.70 The difference from baseline for total size of adenomas increased in the low-AGE group, whereas an increase in the high-AGE group was suppressed for the second interval. The difference from baseline for the total size of adenomas in subjects who had adenomas at baseline increased in the low-AGE group and decreased in the high-AGE group for the second interval. The results of this study suggest the possibility of preventive and therapeutic effects of AGE on colorectal adenomas, although it would be necessary to investigate these results in larg- er-scale and longer-term trials. In a double-blind study in patients with advanced cancer, the pri- mary end point used was a quality of life (QOL) questionnaire based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy. The sub–end points were changes in NK cell activity and salivary cortisol levels before and after administering AGE. The group consisted of 42 patients with liver cancer (84%), 7 patients with pancreatic cancer (14%), and 1 patient with colon cancer (2%). Drug compliance was relatively good in both the AGE and placebo groups. Although no difference was observed in QOL, both the number of NK cells and NK cell activity increased sig- nificantly in the AGE group.71


Although garlic has long been used in infectious conditions, a use sup- ported by its antimicrobial and immune-enhancing properties, the primary clinical use of garlic has focused on its role in cardiovascular disease. Specifically, garlic is recommended primarily for its ability to lower cholesterol and blood pressure in the attempt to reduce the risk of dying prematurely from a heart attack or stroke. In addition to the use of garlic preparations, garlic consumption as a food should be encouraged in patients with high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cholesterol-Lowering Activity

One of the major areas of focus in garlic’s ability to offer significant protection against heart disease and strokes has been the evaluation of its ability to lower blood cholesterol levels.1,72–76 Unfortunately, the results are inconsistent. Most, but not all, of the double-blind, place- bo-controlled studies in patients with initial cholesterol levels greater than 200 given a commercial garlic preparation, providing a daily dose of at least 10 mg alliin or a total allicin potential of 4000 mcg, showed an ability to lower total serum cholesterol levels by about 10% to 12%. In addition, LDL cholesterol decreased by about 15%, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels usually increased by about 10%, and triglyceride levels typically dropped by 15%,1,58,59,76–83 whereas most trials not using products that delivered this dosage of allicin failed to produce a lipid-lowering effect.58–62 However, based on some clini- cal trials, even using a well-defined garlic preparation is not sufficient assurance that positive results will be seen.84–87 One study worth mentioning evaluated the effect of raw garlic and two commonly used garlic supplements against a placebo on cholesterol concentrations in adults with moderate hypercholester- olemia. In the trial, 192 adults with low-density lipoprotein choles- terol (LDL-C) concentrations of 130 to 190 mg/dL were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatment arms: raw garlic, powdered garlic supplement, AGE supplement, or placebo. Garlic product doses equivalent to four average-sized garlic cloves a day were given 6 days/week for 6 months. None of the forms of garlic used, including raw garlic, had statistically or clinically significant effects on LDL-C or other plasma lipid concentrations in adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia.87 At present, it can be concluded that the cholesterol-lowering effects of supplemental garlic preparations on cholesterol levels are extremely variable and modest at best. Nonetheless, the combination of lowering

LDL and raising HDL can greatly improve the HDL/LDL ratio, a signif- icant goal in the prevention of heart disease and strokes. Garlic prepa- rations exert several other beneficial effects in preventing heart disease and strokes (discussed under “Platelet Aggregation Inhibition”) and have also been shown to improve blood sugar control in diabetics with hyperlipidemia.88 In addition to taking a garlic supplement, individuals with high cholesterol levels should eat more garlic and onions because increased dietary intake of garlic and onions can also lower cholesterol lev- els.72–75,89 In a 1979 population study, researchers studied three populations of vegetarians in the Jain community in India who con- sumed differing amounts of garlic and onions.90,91 Numerous favor- able effects on blood lipids, as shown in Table 51.1, were observed in the group that consumed the largest amount. Blood fibrinogen (discussed in “Fibrinolytic Activity”) levels were highest in the group eating no onions or garlic. The study was quite significant because the subjects had nearly identical diets, except in garlic and onion ingestion.

## Hypertension

Garlic has demonstrated hypotensive action in both experimen- tal animal models and humans with hypertension.72–75,92–96 A meta-analysis of published and unpublished randomized controlled trials of garlic preparations was conducted to determine the effect of garlic on blood pressure relative to placebo.92 Eight trials (seven double-blind, one single-blind) were identified as meeting analytic criteria. A total of 415 subjects were included in the analysis. All tri- als used a dried garlic powder standardized to contain 1.3% alliin at a dosage of 600 to 900 mg/day (corresponding to 7.8 and 11.7 mg of alliin or the equivalent of approximately 1.8–2.7 g of fresh garlic daily). The meta-analysis concluded that garlic preparations designed to yield allicin lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures over a 1- to 3-month period. The typical drop from pooled data was 11 mm Hg in the systolic and 5 mm Hg in the diastolic. This degree of blood pressure reduction in hypertensives can be quite significant. If the blood pressure–lowering effects of garlic can be maintained, the risk of stroke may be reduced by an estimated 30% to 40% and the risk of heart attack by 20% to 25%.

<!-- chunk -->

## Platelet Aggregation Inhibition

Excessive platelet aggregation is strongly linked to atherosclerosis, heart disease, and strokes. Garlic preparations standardized for alliin content, as well as garlic oil and AGE, have all demonstrated signif- icant inhibition of platelet aggregation.67,72–75,97,98 In one study, patients with increased platelet aggregation were given either 900 mg/ day of a dried garlic preparation containing 1.3% alliin or a placebo for 4 weeks.97 In the garlic group, spontaneous platelet aggregation disap- peared, the microcirculation of the skin increased by 47.6%, plasma viscosity decreased by 3.2%, diastolic blood pressure dropped from an average of 74 to 67 mm Hg, and fasting blood glucose concentration dropped from an average of 90 to 79 mg/dL.

## Fibrinolytic Activity

Epidemiological studies have suggested that excessive fibrinogen for- mation is a major primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease.99 Garlic preparations standardized for alliin content and garlic oil as well as both fried and raw garlic have been shown to significantly increase serum fibrinolytic activity in humans.100,101 This increase occurs within the first 6 hours after ingestion and continues for up to 12 hours.

## Prevention of Low-Density Lipoprotein Oxidation and

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Vascular Effects

Growing evidence indicates that LDL oxidation plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, substances that prevent oxidation of LDL may slow down atherosclerosis. Garlic is known to exert antioxidant activity and has recently been shown to exert significant effects on preventing LDL oxidation.65,66,102–105 In one study, healthy human volunteers given 600 mg/day of a garlic preparation providing 7.8 mg alliin for 2 weeks had a 34% lower sus- ceptibility to lipoprotein oxidation compared with controls.102 These results are significant given the short amount of time in which they were produced, coupled with the importance of reducing lipoprotein oxidation. A placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involved 23 subjects with coronary artery disease who had at least 75% blockage in one to three major coronary arteries. Two and 4 hours after the subjects ingested a single 300-mg dose of garlic powder, the atherogenicity of their sera was markedly decreased, less cholesterol had accumulated, and there were lower levels of oxidized LDL in human aortic smooth muscle cells cultured with patients’ sera after treatment compared with those cul- tured with sera obtained before administration of garlic. After 3 weeks of therapy at 300 mg, three times daily, blood serum atherogenicity was decreased twofold compared with initial levels.106 Because AGE has also shown an ability to prevent LDL oxidation,104 it is likely that S-allylcysteine and other nonallicin components of gar- lic play a major role in the protection against LDL oxidation. Studies have also shown garlic or garlic components to exert posi- tive effects on endothelial function, vascular reactivity, and peripheral blood flow.107–109 For example, a randomized, double-blind, place- bo-controlled trial demonstrated that supplementation with garlic extract favorably modifies endothelial biomarkers, such as high-sensi- tivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and total antioxidant status, associ- ated with cardiovascular risk.110


On the basis of extensive clinical research, a commercial garlic prod- uct should provide a daily dose equal to at least 4000 mg of fresh garlic. This dosage translates to at least 10 mg alliin or a total allicin potential of μ g. Alternatively, AGE at a dosage of 2.4 to 7.2 g/ day can be used.


For the vast majority of individuals, garlic is nontoxic at the dosages commonly used. For some, however, it can irritate the digestive tract and cause heartburn. Others are apparently unable to effectively detox- ify allicin and other sulfur-containing components. Prolonged feeding of large amounts of raw garlic to rats resulted in anemia, weight loss, and failure to grow.111 Although the exact toxicity of garlic has yet to be definitively determined, side effects are rare at the recommended dos- age. Garlic is thought to be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Two studies showed that babies liked breast milk better from mothers who ate garlic.112,113

Generally, garlic supplements should not be used in patients taking anticoagulant drugs (e.g., Coumadin) or in those scheduled for elective surgery because of garlic’s effects on platelet aggregation. The excep- tion to this warning is AGE because it appears safe for use in patients on warfarin therapy.114 Although garlic components have shown an ability to affect cyto- chrome P450 enzymes, they do not appear to interfere with drug metabolism.115,116

## Anthraquinones

In 1851 the cathartic action of aloe was discovered to be caused by aloin, a lemon yellow powder formed from drying of the bitter latex (Fig. 52.2). From this material several anthracenes have been isolated, the major anthraquinone being barbaloin. Barbaloin and aloin are often referred to synonymously. Although aloe contains other anthraquinone derivatives, including the anthracene known as aloe-emodin, barbaloin is consid- ered the most potent cathartic. As a whole, most of the anthraquinone compounds in aloe are water-soluble glycosides easily separated from the water-insoluble resinous material. However, rhein (4,5-dihydroxy- anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid) is a lipophilic anthraquinone in Aloe sp. that has been shown to exert many pharmacological effects beyond any laxative effect, including hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, anti- inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities.3

## Saccharides

Recent research on A. vera has focused on the glycoprotein, mucopoly- saccharide, and polysaccharide constituents.4,5 Aloe contains the poly- saccharides galactose, xylose, arabinose, and acetylated mannose or acemannan. The latter has received considerable research attention and has shown significant antiviral and immunopotentiating effects, as well as osteogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activity. Acemannan is a water-soluble, long-chain polydispersoid β (1,4)-linked mannan polymer interspersed with O-acetyl groups found mainly in aloe gel.6

## Prostanoids

Several prostanoid compounds have been discovered in A. vera extracts.7 The conversion of essential fatty acids to prostanoids by the enzyme cyclooxygenase in a plant such as A. vera is rare. The major unsaturated fatty acid in the plant is γ -linolenic acid (C18:3), which can be converted to icosatrienoic acid, the precursor to prostaglan- dins of the 1 series. The 1 series prostaglandins are known to exert more favorable effects on inflammation, allergy, platelet aggregation, and wound healing. The presence of γ -linoleic acid or prostaglandins, or both, in a stable medium, along with inhibitors of thromboxane synthesis, may be another important chemical characteristic of aloe responsible for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects.

## Superoxide Dismutase

Extracts from the parenchymatous leaf gel and the rind of aloe (A. bar- badensis Miller) have been shown to contain seven electrophoretically identifiable superoxide dismutases (SODs). Two of these seven are mangano SODs, whereas the other five activities are cupro-zinc SODs.8

## Other Constituents

Other biological active compounds found in A. vera include the following: • A serine carboxypeptidase • Salicylates • Minerals • Vitamins • Sterols • Amino acids Box 52.1 provides a partial listing of the remarkably diverse range of compounds isolated from A. vera.


A. vera has a storied history of use. Mesopotamian clay tablets dated 1750 bc indicate that A. vera was used for medicinal purposes. Egyptian

## 423CHAPTER 52 Aloe vera (Cape Aloe)

records from 550 bc also mentioned aloe for infections of the skin. The ancient Greeks were also aware of aloe’s medicinal effects, because both Pliny (23–79 ad) and Dioscorides (first century ad) wrote of aloe’s ability to treat wounds and heal infections of the skin. A. vera is still widely used in many traditional systems of medicine. In India, for example, in addition to external applications, aloe (whole leaves, the exudate, and the fresh gel) is used as a cathartic, stomachic, and anthelmintic. A. vera has been adopted into their materia medicas by many cultures of the world.1 In the United States the history of aloe can be traced as far back as the United States Pharmacopoeia of 1820, where a number of aloe preparations were described. Most of these preparations were designed to take advantage of aloe’s laxative effects. By the early 1900s, more than 27 different aloe preparations were in popular use. In 1920 aloe began being cultivated for pharmaceutic use. A major development in the modern use of aloe occurred in when a group of physicians successfully used the fresh juice to treat a patient with facial burns caused by radiographs.9 The relief offered by aloe in the topical treatment of burns, minor irritations, skin ulcers, and other skin disorders is a major reason why companies supplying dermatological and cosmetic products have incorporated aloe into many of their formulations. Although more and more of aloe’s medicinal effects are being con- firmed, it is still predominantly administered without direct medical supervision. Therefore the history and folk use of aloe are continuing to evolve.


The pharmacology of aloe is surprisingly diverse. Its laxative, immune potentiation, antimicrobial, and wound-healing activities help explain its wide-ranging folk and clinical applications.

## Laxative Effects

Although physicians have prescribed the whole aloe leaf as a cathartic for more than 2000 years, it was not until 1851 that the active princi- pal aloin was discovered.1 In small doses, aloin acts as a tonic to the digestive system, giving tone to the intestinal muscle. At higher doses, it becomes a strong purgative. Its actions are most obvious on the large intestine, where it increases colonic secretions and peristaltic contrac- tions. In combination with strychnine and belladonna, aloin became one of the most popular laxatives for chronic constipation for many years. Because aloin often causes painful contractions, other anthraqui- none laxatives like cascara and senna are now much more popular.10,11 A substantial amount of research activity continues in an effort to understand the laxative effects of aloe. Research using the rat large intestine showed that the increase in water content of the large intestine induced by barbaloin preceded the stimulation of peristalsis, attended by diarrhea. Therefore it was suggested that the increase in water con- tent was a more important factor than the stimulation of peristalsis in the diarrhea induced by barbaloin.12 Further studies by the same researchers suggested that aloe-emodin-9-anthrone (AE-anthrone) produced from barbaloin in the rat large intestine might be the actual chemical mediator of this effect. AE-anthrone not only caused an increase in the intestinal water content but also stimulated mucus secretion.13

## Bowel Detoxification

In 1985 Bland14 reported the effect of orally consumed A. vera juice on urinary indican, gastrointestinal pH, stool culture, and stool specific gravity in a semicontrolled study of 10 (5 men and 5 women) healthy human subjects.14 Urinary indican (see Chapter 30) is used as an indi- cator of the degree to which either dietary protein is malabsorbed or intestinal bacteria are engaged in putrefactive processes. After a full week of drinking 6 oz. of A. vera juice three times daily, urinary indican levels decreased one full unit. This suggests that regular A. vera juice consumption can lead to improved protein digestion and assimilation or reduced bacterial putrefaction, or both.

## Inhibition of Gastric Acid Secretion

With Heidelberg gastric analysis, A. vera juice was shown to increase gastric pH by an average of 1.88 U. This supports the findings of other researchers that A. vera gel can inhibit the secretion of hydrochloric acid. The Heidelberg test also demonstrated that A. vera juice can slow down gastric emptying, possibly leading to improved digestion. Six of the 10 subjects showed marked alterations in stool cultures after the week-long study. This implies that A. vera juice may exert some bacteriostatic or fungistatic activity. In the four subjects with positive cultures for yeast, there was a reduction in the number of yeast colonies. Stool specific gravity was reduced after the week of drinking A. vera juice. This implies improved water retention, yet none of the subjects complained of diarrhea or loose stools.

## Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity

Aloe demonstrated activity against many common bacteria and fungi in several studies. In a detailed review of these studies, the researchers assayed the antimicrobial properties of an A. vera extract and reviewed the work of others.15-17 Both mean inhibitory and mean lethal con- centrations were determined and compared with silver sulfadiazine (SSD), a potent antiseptic used in the treatment of extensive burns. As shown in Table 52.1,18 the antimicrobial effects of A. vera compare quite favorably with those of SSD. A 60% A. vera extract was found to be bactericidal against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. agalactiae. Concentrations of 70% aloe were bacteri- cidal for Staphylococcus aureus, 80% for Escherichia coli, and 90% for S. faecalis and Candida albicans. Organisms inhibited in other studies

## Antiviral Effects

Acemannan (acetylated mannose) in injectable form has been approved for veterinary use in fibrosarcomas and feline leukemia. Its action in feline leukemia is quite impressive. Feline leukemia, like AIDS, is caused by a retrovirus (feline leukemia virus). The virus is so lethal that once cats develop clinical symptoms, they are usually euthanized. Typically more than 70% of cats die within 8 weeks of the onset of clini- cal signs. In a study of 44 cats with clinically confirmed feline leukemia, acemannan was injected (2 mg/kg) weekly for 6 weeks and the cats were reexamined 6 weeks after termination of treatment.19 At the end of the 12-week study, 71% of the cats were alive and in good health. Acemannan demonstrated significant antiviral activity against sev- eral viruses, including feline AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza virus, and measles virus.20-22

## Immune Enhancement

Acemannan is a potent immunostimulant.18,23-25 Among the effects noted for acemannan are the enhancement of macrophage release of interleukin (IL)-1- α , cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and nitric oxide release, as well as phagocytosis and nonspecific cytotoxicity. Acemannan also enhances T-cell function and interferon production, although these actions may also be caused by enhanced macrophage function. Macrophage production of cytokines IL-6 and tumor necro- sis factor- α were dependent on the dose of acemannan provided. These effects can be substantial. For example, in one study, acemannan was shown to enhance the macrophage respiratory burst (twofold increase above the media controls), phagocytosis (45% compared with 25% in controls), and killing of C. albicans (38% killing of C. albicans com- pared with 0%–5% killing in controls).26

## Hematopoietic Effects

Several complex carbohydrates have been found to significantly stim- ulate hematopoiesis. CARN 750, a polydispersed β -(1,4)-linked acetyl- ated mannan isolated from the A. vera plant, has been shown to have hemato-augmenting properties. Subcutaneous injections of 1 mg/ mouse of CARN 750 optimally increased hematopoietic progenitors, measured as IL-3, supported colony-forming units, culture (CFU-C) and high proliferative potential colony-forming cell (HPP-CFC) assays in the spleen. Providing 2 mg/animal of CARN 750 optimally increased bone marrow cellularity, frequency, and absolute number of HPP- CFCs and CFU-Cs. The hematopoietic activity of CARN 750 increased with the frequency of administration. The greatest increase in activity occurred in mice myelosuppressed with radiation.27

## Anti-inflammatory Activity

A. vera has been shown to exert a number of anti-inflammatory actions, including blocking of the generation of inflammatory mediators like thromboxanes and bradykinin, reducing neutrophil infiltration during inflammation, and reducing edema. Several compounds in aloe are responsible for these actions. The most important are glycoproteins, which inhibit and actually break down bradykinin, a major mediator of pain and inflammation; various anthraquinones; and salicylates. These anti-inflammatory substances may be of significance in both topical and oral applications. One comprehensive study evaluated the effects of aqueous, chlo- roform, and ethanol extracts of A. vera gel on carrageenan-induced edema in the rat paw and neutrophil migration into the peritoneal cavity stimulated by carrageenan. The capacity of the aqueous extract to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase activity was also evaluated. The aqueous and chloroform extracts decreased the edema induced in the hind paw and the number of neutrophils migrating into the peritoneal cavity, whereas the ethanol extract only decreased the number of neutrophils. The aqueous extract was also found to inhibit prostaglandin E 2 pro- duction from arachidonic acid, demonstrating an inhibitory action on cyclooxygenase. The aqueous extract contained anthraglycosides, reductor sugars, and cardiotonic glycosides, whereas the ethanol extract contained saponins, carbohydrates, naphthoquinone, sterols, triterpenoids, and anthraquinones. The chloroform extract contained sterols and anthraquinones.28 Another useful aspect of aloe is its ability to inhibit lipid peroxi- dation and scavenge free radicals. One study measured the activity of seven anthraquinones and four anthrones against nonenzymatic and enzymatic lipid peroxidation in vitro and their ability to scavenge free radicals. Using rat hepatocytes exposed to strong oxidizing agents, dithranol and anthrone provided the strongest inhibition of nonen- zymatic peroxidation. Rhein anthrone and aloe-emodin showed the highest inhibitory activity against peroxidation of linoleic acid cata- lyzed by lipoxygenase. Anthrone, dithranol, and rhein anthrone were the most effective free radical scavengers.29

## Alcohol Detoxification

Oral administration of aloin (300 mg/kg) given 12 hours before administration of alcohol (3 g/kg) significantly decreases the blood alcohol area under the curve by a remarkable 40%. This suggests an increase in the rate of blood alcohol elimination from the body of 45% to 50%. Analysis of hepatic triglyceride levels revealed that both etha- nol and aloin given alone significantly increased the triglyceride levels in a comparable manner. However, the level obtained by the combined treatment of aloin and ethanol was not statistically different from that produced by either treatment alone. The levels of serum l-aspar- tate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and l-alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activities were not increased by acute alcohol intoxi- cation, aloin alone, or the combined treatment of alcohol and aloin.30


The topical effects of A. vera appear to be caused by a combination of enhancement of wound healing along with anti-inflammatory, mois- turizing, emollient, and antimicrobial actions.31 A. vera contains a num- ber of compounds necessary for wound healing, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc. Unlike many other anti-inflammatory substances, A. vera has been shown to stimulate fibroblast and connective tissue formation, thereby promoting wound repair. Finally, aloe appears to stimulate the epidermal growth and repair process, including increas- ing the manufacture of supportive glycosaminoglycans, presumably as a result of its polysaccharides.32 Mannose-6-phosphate, the major sugar in the A. vera gel, may be its most active growth substance.33 Another interesting effect of aloe in wound healing is its ability to counteract the wound-healing suppression effects of cortisone. In one study, A. vera at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg daily for 4 days blocked the wound-healing suppression of hydrocortisone acetate up to 100% using the wound tensile strength assay. The authors suggested this response was because of the growth factors present in A. vera masking the wound-healing inhibitors.34

## Skin Health, Wound Healing, Burns, Frostbite, etc.

Despite growing consumer awareness of A. vera’s soothing effects on burns and wound healing during the past 50 years, few human studies

## 425CHAPTER 52 Aloe vera (Cape Aloe)

have been conducted.35 Virtually all of the studies support the topi- cal use of A. vera gel, especially in minor burns or skin inflammation. There is also some support for use in more severe tissue damage. Although limited, the human research has been promising. For example, one study found A. vera gel quite successful in three patients with chronic leg ulcers of 5, 7, and 15 years’ duration.36 The gel was applied to the ulcers on gauze bandages. Rapid reduction in ulcer size was noted in all three subjects, and complete resolution occurred in two. Encouraging results were also reported for acne and seborrhea. In a study of 27 patients with a partial-thickness burn wound, treat- ment with A. vera gel was compared with Vaseline gauze. The average time of healing in the aloe gel area was a statistically significant and dramatic 1 week shorter: 11.9 days compared with 18.2 days for the Vaseline gauze–treated wound. Histological evaluation showed early epithelialization in the A. vera gel–treated area.37 In another double-blind study, the efficacy of A. vera cream for partial-thickness burn wounds was studied and compared with that of SSD. Thirty patients with similar types of second-degree burns at two sites on different parts of the body were included in this study. Each patient had one burn treated with topical SSD and one treated with aloe cream, randomly. The rate of reepithelialization and healing of the partial thickness burns was significantly faster in the site treated with aloe than in the site treated with SSD (15.9 vs 18.73 days, respectively; P <0.0001).38 Another study compared the therapeutic effects of systemic pent- oxifylline with topical A. vera cream in the treatment of frostbite. The frostbitten ears of 10 New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to one of four treatment groups: untreated controls, those treated with A. vera cream, those treated with pentoxifylline, and those treated with A. vera cream and pentoxifylline. The control group had a 6% tissue survival. Tissue survival was notably improved with pentoxifylline (20%), was better with A. vera cream (24%), and was best with the combination therapy (30%).39 Aloe may also prove useful in more severe tissue injuries, such as those seen in necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis usually mani- fests as a low-grade cellulitis that quickly deteriorates to a limb- and life-threatening soft tissue infection. Immediate surgical débridement is essential, followed by aggressive wound management. An interesting report described excellent results in two cases. Case 1 was a 72-year- old female who, upon presenting to the emergency department with a “sore bottom,” was diagnosed with five problems: • Anal-rectal abscess • Fournier’s gangrene • Ulcerative colitis • Chronic blood loss/anemia • Protein caloric malnutrition After débridement, her anal-rectal wound extended from the labia to the left buttock. Care was multidisciplinary and included applying a water-based aloe gel and saline-soaked gauze twice a day. After 45 days, the wound exhibited a pink base with granulation tissue and contrac- tion of the wound edges. Case 2 was a 48-year-old male with seroma of the left leg secondary to a crush injury. Within 3 days he developed deep vein thrombosis in that leg, as well as two large seroma cavities on either side of the thigh. Care included packing with aloe gel and saline-soaked sponges. Two weeks after admission, the anterior wound was covered with a split-thick- ness skin graft, whereas partial closure of the lateral cavity was attempted unsuccessfully with retention sutures. After 5 weeks, healing was complete for the anterior wound and 95% complete for the posterior wound.40 A double-blind study also showed that patients with pressure sores responded equally to an acemannan hydrogel wound dressing or a moist saline gauze wound dressing.41 Several studies have also shown that topical aloe preparations can accelerate healing from surgical wounds. In one of the more recent studies, 90 women who had undergone cesarean delivery were ran- domly divided into two groups. In one group, the wound was dressed with aloe vera gel, whereas simple dressing was used in the control group. Wound healing was assessed 24 hours and 8 days after the cesarean operation using a standard scale. A significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to the wound healing score 24 hours after the operation, with 45 women in the aloe vera group and 35 in the control group obtaining a zero score.42 A topical cream containing 0.5% Aloe vera juice powder showed benefits posthemorrhoidectomy. Application of the cream on the sur- gical site was shown to be effective in reducing postoperative pain both on resting and during defecation, healing time, and analgesic require- ments in the patients compared with the placebo group.43 Oral ingestion of aloe preparations may also help promote wound healing. In particular, sterol-rich extracts. Sterolic fractions of aloe stimulate collagen and hyaluronic acid production in human dermal fibroblasts. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled study an oral aloe sterol supplement was shown to promote very positive effects on skin elasticity, hydration, and the collagen scores in 64 healthy women (age range 30–59 years; average 44.3 years). The improved collagen score was based on the measured collagen content in the dermis by ultrasound.44

## Psoriasis

Several studies have shown topical treatment with aloe preparations may help psoriasis. One double-blind, placebo-controlled study eval- uating the clinical efficacy and tolerability of topical A. vera extract 0.5% in a hydrophilic cream obtained impressive results. Sixty patients (36 males and 24 females) aged 18 to 50 years (mean 25.6 years) with slight to moderate chronic plaque–type psoriasis and psoriasis area, and severity index (PASI) scores between 4.8 and 16.7 (mean 9.3) were enrolled and randomized to two groups. The mean duration of the disease before enrollment was 8.5 years (range 1–21 years). Patients self-administered trial medication topically at home three times daily for 5 consecutive days/week (maximum 4 weeks active treatment). Patients were examined on a weekly basis, and those showing a pro- gressive reduction of lesions, desquamation followed by decreased ery- thema, infiltration, and lowered PASI score were considered healed. The study was scheduled for 16 weeks with 12 months of follow-up on a monthly basis. The treatment was well tolerated by all the patients, with no adverse drug-related symptoms and no dropouts. By the end of the study, the A. vera extract cream had cured 25 of 30 patients (83.3%) compared with the placebo cure rate of only 2 of 30 patients (6.6%), resulting in significant clearing of the psoriatic plaques (328 of 396, or 82.8%) versus placebo (28 of 366, or 7.7%), and a decreased PASI score to a mean of 2.2.45 In another study, the efficacy of topical A. vera was compared with 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide (TA) in mild to moderate plaque psori- asis. After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean PASI score decreased from 11.6 to 3.9 in the A. vera group and from 10.9 to 4.3 in the TA group. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index scores decreased from 8.6 to 2.5 in the A. vera group and from 8.1 to 2.3 in the TA group. These results indicated that both treatments had similar efficacy in improv- ing the quality of life of patients with mild to moderate psoriasis.46

## Radiation Burns

Research into the topical applications of A. vera gel began in the 1930s for the treatment of radiation burns. During the 1930s, radiographs were used therapeutically for cancer, eczema, and other skin com- plaints, and as a depilatory agent. In 1935 Collins and Collins9 reported

## 426SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

the success of A. vera gel in a single case, a woman with a patch of severe x-ray dermatitis on her forehead. The woman had tried various medical treatments for 8 months, only to have her condition worsen. The Collinses were going to perform a skin graft, but as a temporary measure applied a preparation of fresh whole A. vera leaves to reduce the itching. The result was that “Twenty-four hours later she reported that the sensation of itching and burning had entirely subsided,” and by 5 weeks “there was complete regeneration of the skin of the fore- head and scalp, new hair growth, complete restoration of sensation, and absence of scar.” Five months after treatment was started, there was complete healing. The following case reports, although not as pos- itive as this initial study, clearly indicated that A. vera was effective in some cases. Until the 1940s most of the studies on aloe were reported case histories.4 To substantiate these case studies, animal studies began to appear in the literature. Rowe and colleagues35 performed several stud- ies in rats with radiation-induced ulcers and determined that fresh aloe pulp was effective, whereas dried aloe powder was not.4,34 In 1953 Lushbaugh and Hale,36 working for the US Atomic Energy Commission, produced one of the most convincing studies of the effi- cacy of A. vera gel. Twenty albino rats were exposed to β -radiation, and different treatments were used on quadrants of the affected area of each animal. The treatments used were fresh A. vera leaf, a commercial A. vera ointment, application of a dry gauze bandage, and an untreated control. Both fresh A. vera and the A. vera ointment produced clear improvements. At the end of 2 months, the A. vera–treated areas were completely healed, whereas the other two areas had not yet healed at the end of 4 months. A large placebo-controlled, double-blind study cast doubt on the efficacy of aloe for severe radiation burns. Three Phase III randomized trials were reported in this study. The first one was double-blind, used a placebo gel, and involved 194 women receiving breast or chest wall irradiation. The second trial randomized 108 such patients to A. vera gel versus no treatment. Skin dermatitis was scored weekly during both trials both by patients and by health care providers. Skin dermatitis scores were virtually identical on both treatment arms during both tri- als.47 The aim of the study was to see if topical A. vera gel would be beneficial in reducing the identified skin side effects of radiation ther- apy, including erythema, pain, itching, dry desquamation, and moist desquamation compared with aqueous cream. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of other factors known to predict severity of radi- ation skin reaction (i.e., breast size, smoking habit, and one or more drainages of lymphocele after surgery) on other skin side effects. The third study involved more than 225 patients with breast cancer after lumpectomy or partial mastectomy who required a course of radiation therapy using tangential fields. Like the other two studies, A. vera gel did not significantly reduce radiation-induced skin side effects.48 These surprising results might be explained by another study that compared the efficacy of commercially available gels with an aceman- nan-rich extract from aloe leaves in the treatment of irradiated mice. Male C3H mice received graded single doses of γ -radiation ranging from 30 to 47.5 Gy to the right leg. In most experiments, the gel was applied daily, beginning immediately after irradiation. To determine the timing of application for the best effect, gel was applied beginning on days −7, 0, or +7 relative to the day of irradiation (day 0) and con- tinuing for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 weeks. The right inner thigh of each mouse was scored on a scale of 0 to 3.5 for severity of radiation reaction from the seventh to thirty-fifth day after irradiation. Dose–response curves were obtained by plotting the percentage of mice that reached or exceeded a given peak skin reaction as a function of dose. The researchers found that although the acemannan-rich extract gel was highly effective, the commercially available gel showed no improvement over the control. They also found that the aloe gel had to be applied immediately after irradiation and continued for at least 2 weeks. There was no effect if the aloe gel was applied only before irradiation or beginning 1 week after irradiation. Clearly, the quality and concentration of aloe constituents are crucial if clinical results are to be obtained.53 In addition, the phys- ical form of the preparation (e.g., gel vs. cream) may be important, as a study using a well-defined aloe extract in a cream showed no benefit in protecting against radiation injury to the skin in women being treated for breast cancer.49 One area where A. vera gel has shown some benefit is in acute radiation-induced proctitis (ARP), a common side effect that affects up to 50% of patients receiving radiotherapy. In a double-blind pla- cebo-controlled trial, 20 consecutive patients with ARP after exter- nal-beam radiation therapy of pelvic malignancies were randomized to receive either A. vera 3% or placebo ointment, 1 g twice daily for 4 weeks. These patients presented with at least two of the following symptoms: rectal bleeding, abdominal/rectal pain, diarrhea, or fecal urgency. A symptom index and lifestyle effect was calculated by the addition of the scores from a questionnaire. Results showed a signifi- cant (P < 0.05) improvement in the symptom index for diarrhea, fecal urgency, clinical presentation total, and lifestyle effect. Hemorrhage and abdominal/rectal pain did not improve significantly. The odds ratios for advantage of A. vera over placebo for “clinical presentation total” was 3.97.

## Gastric Ulcers, Ulcerative Colitis, and Rectal Disorders

Internal use of A. vera gel to treat peptic ulcers was first studied in 1963.50 Twelve patients with x-ray–confirmed duodenal ulcers were given 1 tablespoon of an emulsion of A. vera gel in mineral oil once daily. At the end of 1 year, all patients demonstrated complete recovery and no recurrence. On the basis of experimental evidence, the follow- ing factors were considered responsible for the effectiveness: • A. vera gel inactivates pepsin in a reversible fashion. When the stomach is devoid of food, pepsin is inhibited by A. vera gel; how- ever, in the presence of food, pepsin is released and allowed to digest the food. • The gel inhibits the release of hydrochloric acid via interference with histamine binding to the parietal cells. • A. vera gel is an extremely good demulcent that heals and prevents aggravating irritants from reaching the sensitive ulcer. A. vera gel has also been shown to useful for ulcerative colitis. In the double-blind study, 44 patients were randomly given oral A. vera gel or placebo, 100 mL twice daily for 4 weeks. Clinical remission, improve- ment, and response occurred in 9 (30%), 11 (37%), and 14 (47%), respectively, of 30 patients given aloe vera, compared with 1 (7%), (7%), and 2 (14%), respectively, of 14 patients taking placebo. The Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index and histological scores decreased significantly during treatment with A. vera (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively), but not with placebo.51 A topical cream containing 0.5% A. vera juice powder showed ben- efits in the treatment of chronic anal fissures.52 The aloe cream was applied by the patients to the wound site three times per day for weeks. There were statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001) in chronic anal fissure pain, hemorrhaging upon defection, and wound healing before and at the end of the first week of treatment with the aloe cream compared with the control group. This aloe preparation was also shown to be great benefit after hemorrhoidectomy (men- tioned previously).

## Oral Mucosal Disorders

The topical benefits of aloe preparations extend to the oral mucosa. According to a systematic review, aloe preparations have been

## 427CHAPTER 52 Aloe vera (Cape Aloe)

evaluated in 15 clinical trials ranging in size from 20 patients to patients with clinically diagnosed oral mucosal lesions. Most of the studies showed statistically significant clinical improvement in such conditions as oral lichen planus, submucous fibrosis, burning mouth syndrome, radiation-induced mucositis, candida-associated denture stomatitis, xerostomic patients, and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.53 Oral submucosa fibrosis is a chronic, complex, premalignant con- dition linked most often to betel nut chewing. Given A. vera’s anti-in- flammatory, wound-healing, antioxidant, and antineoplastic activities, it would appear to be an effective intervention. In the most recent study, the clinical response to A. vera juice or gel was comparable to that of intralesional injections of hydrocortisone and hyaluronidase combined with oral antioxidant supplementation.54 In the treatment of lichen planus, results from five double-blind clinical trials indicate that aloe vera is more efficient than placebo and has a comparable effect to triamcinolone acetonide.53,55 In the most recent study, 40 patients with lichen planus were randomly divided into two equal groups. Group A patients received aloe vera gel, whereas group B patients received triamcinolone acetonide. When clinical signs and symptoms were observed after 8 weeks of therapy, it was deter- mined that aloe vera gel was more effective than triamcinolone aceton- ide in the treatment of oral lichen planus.56

## Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Although acemannan has demonstrated some direct antiviral activ- ity against HIV-1 by inhibiting glycosylation of viral glycoproteins, its main promise in treating AIDS and HIV may be to enhance the action of azidothymidine (AZT), one of the antiviral drugs used in the treatment of AIDS. In vitro studies have shown that acemannan combined with suboptimal noncytotoxic concentrations of AZT or acyclovir acts synergistically to inhibit the replication of HIV and her- pes simplex type 1 (HSV-1).22 On the basis of these studies, as well as preliminary human studies, researchers believe that the use of ace- mannan may reduce the amount of AZT required by as much as 90%. In addition to AZT’s cost, its use is often associated with severe side effects, including anemia and granulocytopenia resulting from bone marrow suppression. Preliminary clinical studies have suggested that acemannan and A. vera may be beneficial when administered orally in HIV-positive individuals. For example, in one study, 14 HIV patients prescribed oral acemannan (800 mg/day) demonstrated significant increases in circulating monocytes/macrophages. In particular, there were signifi- cant increases in the number of large circulating monocytes, indicat- ing improvement in phagocytizing, processing, and presenting cells in the blood.57 In a study of 15 AIDS patients receiving an oral dose of acemannan (800 mg/day), the average scores of Modified Walter Reed (MWR) Clinical Evaluation scoring, absolute T-4, absolute T-8, and p24 core antigen levels all improved in those surviving (Table 52.2) at the end of 900 days. Two patients died of AIDS, and another com- mitted suicide. From this study and others, it has been suggested that prognostic criteria to determine the most responsive patients are those with an absolute T-4 count greater than 150/mm3 and p24 levels less than 300. Unfortunately, a follow-up study did not reproduce these early, promising results. A comprehensive study assessed the safety and effi- cacy of acemannan as an adjunctive to antiretroviral therapy among male patients (mean age, 39 years) with advanced HIV disease receiv- ing zidovudine (ZDV) or didanosine (ddI).58 The randomized, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial provided a large dose of acemannan (400 mg orally four times daily). Eligible patients had CD4 counts of 50 to 300/ μ L twice within 1 month of study entry and had received months of antiretroviral treatment (ZDV or ddI) at a stable dose for the month before entry. CD4 counts were made every 4 weeks for weeks. p24 antigen was measured at entry and every 12 weeks there- after. Sequential quantitative lymphocyte cultures for HIV and ZDV pharmacokinetics were performed in a subset of patients. The mean baseline CD4 counts were 165 and 147/ μ L in the pla- cebo and acemannan groups, respectively; 90% of the patients were receiving ZDV at entry. Six patients in the acemannan group and five in the placebo group developed AIDS-defining illnesses. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups at 48 weeks with regard to the absolute change or rate of decline of the CD4 count. Among ZDV-treated patients, the median rates of CD4 change (ACD4) in the initial 16 weeks were −121 and −120 cells/year in the placebo and acemannan groups, respectively; ACD4 decline from week 16 to 48 was 0 and −61 cells/year in the acemannan and placebo groups, respec- tively (P = 0.11). No statistical difference between groups occurred with regard to adverse events, p24 antigen, quantitative virology, or pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four patients, 11 receiving placebo and receiving acemannan, discontinued study therapy prematurely (none as a result of serious adverse reactions). The decreased, but not statisti- cally significant, rate of loss of CD4 cells in the acemannan group from weeks 16 to 48 provides a possible ray of hope that long-term use, such as reported previously, may be of value, and should be investigated.


A. vera also exhibits a hypoglycemic effect in both normal and alloxan- induced diabetic mice.59 Research began in humans with a small study of five patients with type 2 diabetes ingested half a teaspoonful of aloe four times daily for 14 weeks. Fasting blood sugar in each patient fell from a mean of 273 to 151 mg/dL with no change in body weight. The authors concluded that aloe lowered blood glucose levels by an unknown mechanism.60 A more recent and larger study (49 men and 23 women) provided more support for the efficacy of aloe in combi- nation with glibenclamide in diabetes. Although there was no response to glibenclamide alone, the combination was effective.61 The patients were provided with 1 tablespoon of aloe gel and 5 mg of glibenclamide twice daily, with 5 mg twice daily of glibenclamide serving as the con- trol. After 2 weeks, fasting blood sugar decreased significantly in the treated group, and by day 42 had decreased from an average of mg/dL to a remarkable 148 mg/dL. Although the drop in serum cho- lesterol was insignificant, serum triglycerides decreased from 223 mg/ dL to (again remarkable) 128 mg/dL by day 42. In a systematic review of five randomized controlled trials with A. vera preparations involving 415 participants with prediabetes or early stage type 2 diabetes, results showed that A. vera supplementation sig- nificantly reduced the concentrations of fasting blood glucose, glyco- sylated hemoglobin A1c (Hb A 1c ), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol at the same time increasing serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels.

(but not described) in all of these studies combined. The evidence showed that A. vera can effectively reduce the levels of FBG, HbA1c, triglyceride, TC, and LDL-C, and increase the levels of HDL-C in these patients. The proposed mechanism is improved insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated muscle protein kinase.62

## Asthma

Oral administration of an extract of A. vera for 6 months was shown to produce good results in the treatment of asthma in some individuals of various ages.63 The exception was the fact that the A. vera extract was not effective in patients dependent on corticosteroids. The mechanism of action is thought to be via restoration of protective mechanisms, followed by augmentation of the immune system. The extract used in the study was produced from the supernatant of fresh leaves stored in the dark for 7 days at 4°C. The dosage was mL of a 20% solution of the aloe extract in saline twice daily for weeks. Eleven of 27 patients (40%) without corticosteroid dependence reported significant improvement at the study’s conclusion. Studies indicate that subjecting the leaves to dark and cold results in an increase in the polysaccharide fraction. One gram of the crude extract obtained from leaves stored in the cold and dark produced mg of neutral polysaccharide, compared with only 30 mg produced from leaves not subjected to cold or dark.

## Antioxidant Support

Daily ingestion of an A. vera gel extract for 14 days was shown to increase plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in healthy volunteers without any clinical side effects.63

## Cancer Prevention

Aloe preparations and components have been shown to exert antigeno- toxic and chemopreventive effects in a time-course and dose-dependent manner.64,65 Aloe preparations have also shown efficacy in treatment of spontaneous neoplasms in dogs and cats.66 These studies suggest A. vera may also play a role in humans. One clinical study sought to evalu- ate whether the concomitant administration of aloe could enhance the therapeutic results of melatonin in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom no effective standard anticancer therapies were available. The study included 50 patients with lung cancer, gastrointestinal tract tumors, breast cancer, or brain glioblastoma who were treated with mel- atonin alone (20 mg/day orally in the dark period) or melatonin plus A. vera tincture (1 mL twice daily). A partial response was achieved in two of 24 patients treated with melatonin plus aloe and in none of the patients treated with melatonin alone. Stable disease was achieved in of 24 and in seven of 26 patients treated with melatonin plus aloe or melatonin alone, respectively. Therefore the percentage of nonprogress- ing patients was significantly higher in the group treated with melatonin plus aloe than in the melatonin group (14 of 24 vs. 7 of 26; P <0.05). The percentage of 1-year survival was also significantly higher in patients treated with melatonin plus aloe (9 of 24 vs. 4 of 26; P <0.05).67

## Contraception

An interesting new application of aloe is as a spermicide. Twenty samples of fresh ejaculate from healthy human volunteers between 20 and 30 years of age were treated in vitro with a 1% concentration of zinc acetate combined with lyophilized A. barbadensis (at concen- trations of 7.5%–10%). The combination of zinc acetate with lyo- philized A. barbadensis was shown to possess powerful spermicidal and antiviral effects. This was attributed to their concentration of minerals (boron, barium, calcium, chromium, copper, iron, potas- sium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc), which were toxic to the sperm tail, causing instant immobilization. Studies with rabbit vaginal epithelium showed no irritation. This is important because nonoxynol-9, the active spermicidal ingredient used in vagi- nal contraception for more than 30 years, appears to cause cell mem- brane damage in vaginal and cervical epithelium and may possibly have teratogenic effects.68


A. vera gel can be applied liberally for topical applications. A wide range of products are available on the market; however, simple pure A. vera gel is sufficient. A. vera juice can be consumed orally as a beverage or tonic. Although detailed information is currently lacking as to the optimal dose for these types of products, it is recommended that no more than 1 quart be consumed daily. The dose of acemannan being used in HIV/AIDS patients is 800 to 1600 mg/day. This corresponds to a dose of approximately 0.5 to 1 L/ day for most A. vera juice products. However, there may be great vari- ation in the amount of acemannan in various products.


Although rare, hypersensitivity reactions manifesting as generalized, nummular, eczematous, and papular dermatitis have been reported as a result of topically applied A. vera preparations. In general, topical aloe preparations are not useful for treating deep vertical wounds such as those produced during laparoscopy.69 Oral aloe preparations are extremely well tolerated. There are a few reports of aloe preparations inducing elevations in hepatic enzymes and even acute liver injury.70 Thus it may be appropriate to perform annual assessment of liver function enzymes. There are also a few case reports of aloe ingestion leading to thyroid dysfunction (reduced serum triiodothyronine).


Like other stimulant laxatives, excessive use of aloe dried juice/latex may interact with several drugs. Large doses of aloe may increase the risk of toxicity of antiarrhythmic drugs. Theoretically, potential for adverse effects exists when aloe dried juice/latex is used excessively along with herbs containing cardiac glycosides (e.g., black hellebore, Canadian hemp roots, digitalis leaf, pheasant’s eye plant, pleurisy root, squill bulb leaf scales, Strophanthus seeds) or with cardiac glycoside drugs (e.g., digoxin). Overuse of aloe dried juice/latex can exacerbate the potassium loss caused by corticosteroids, diuretics, horsetail, and licorice root. As a result of the hypoglycemic effects of internally consumed A. vera gel, people using glyburide drugs to control blood sugar (e.g., Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase) should monitor blood glucose levels closely. Aloe dried juice/latex causes shorter gastrointestinal transit time, so it may reduce the absorption of some drugs. Concomitant use of aloe with other stimulant laxative herbs might increase the risk of potassium depletion. In addition to senna leaves and pods and cascara bark, the two herbs most widely used for this purpose, stimulant laxative herbs also include wild cucumber fruit (Ecbolium elaterium), blue flag rhizome, alder buckthorn, European buckthorn, butternut bark, castor oil, colocynth fruit pulp, gamboge bark exudate, jalap root, black root, manna bark exudate, podophyl- lum root, rhubarb root, and yellow dock root.

## Angelica archangelica

A. archangelica is also rich in coumarins and is particularly phototoxic. Coumarins including osthole, angelicin, osthenol, umbelliferone, arch- angelicine, bergapten, and ostruthol are found in significant concentra- tions, with osthole composing nearly 0.2% of the root. The root is also a good source of flavonoids, including archan-gelenone and caffeic acids. The root contains 0.3% to 1% volatile oil, composed mainly of β -phel- landrene, α -pinene, borneol, limonene, and four macrocyclic lactones.3,4

## Angelica sinensis and Angelica acutiloba

In Asia, angelica’s reputation is perhaps second only to ginseng. Predominantly regarded as a female remedy, angelica has been used to treat dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, metrorrhagia, and menopausal symptoms, and to facilitate a healthy pregnancy and easy delivery. Angelica is also used in the treatment of abdominal pain, anemia, inju- ries, arthritis, migraine headache, and many other conditions.3,5

## Angelica archangelica

One of the most highly praised herbs in old herbal texts, A. arch- angelica was used in all Northern European countries as a protection against contagion, for purifying the blood, and for curing every con- ceivable malady; it was considered a sovereign remedy for poisons, agues, and all infections. According to one legend, A. archangelica was revealed in a dream as a cure for the plague. One explanation for the name is related to its blooming near May 8, the feast day of Michael the Archangel. A. archangelica has been used for a wide variety of conditions, including flatulent dyspepsia, pleurisy, respiratory catarrh, and bronchitis. The plant was believed to possess carminative, spasmo- lytic, diaphoretic, expectorant, and diuretic activity.6 A prospective, open-label trial of Feru-guard, a combination of ferulic acid and an extract of A. archangelica, led to significantly reduced subscale scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, indicating that it may be effective for treating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.7

## Angelica atropurpurea

American angelica’s therapeutic use mirrors that of European angelica. It is most commonly used for heartburn and flatulent colic.8


The pharmacology of Angelica spp. primarily relates to high couma- rin content. However, unlike other scientific investigations of botani- cal medicines, most research on Angelica spp. has been done on plant extracts, rather than isolated constituents. The overwhelming majority of studies have been done on the Asian species. Some of the pharmaco- logical activities demonstrated include the following: • Phytoestrogen activity • Cardiovascular effects • Smooth muscle–relaxing effects • Antioxidant effects • Analgesic activity • Antiallergic, immunomodulating, and direct antitumor activity • Antimicrobial activity A B C

## Phytoestrogen Effects

Phytoestrogens (i.e., plant estrogenic substances) are components of many medicinal herbs with historical use in conditions that are now treated by synthetic estrogens. Chinese and Japanese angelica con- tain weakly active phytoestrogens, much lower in activity than other phytoestrogens, and approximately no more than 1:400 are active as estrogen.9 This helps explain why angelica was used in conditions of both excessive and deficient estrogen. Phytoestrogens demonstrate an adaptogenic effect by competing with estrogen for binding sites. When estrogen levels are low, they can exert some weak estrogenic activity; when estrogen levels are high, they reduce overall estrogenic activity by occupying estrogen receptor sites. This alterative action of phy- toestrogens is probably the basis of the plant’s use in amenorrhea and menopause. Japanese angelica has demonstrated uterine tonic activity, causing an initial increase in uterine contraction followed by relaxation.10,11 In addition, administration of Japanese angelica to mice resulted in an increase in uterine weight, an increase in the DNA content of the uterus and liver, and an increase in glucose use by the liver and uterus.1,10 Because of these and other effects, angelica has been referred to as a uterine tonic. Administration of a standardized ethanol extract in ovariectomized rats exhibited stimulation of the uterine histoarchitecture, a signifi- cant cornification in the vaginal epithelium, and a reduction of serum luteinizing hormone concentration, showing the estrogenic nature of the extract. Furthermore, the administration of the extract in intact female rats provoked a significant modification of the vaginal smear in 67% of treated rats.3,12


Angelica possesses significant hypotensive action largely due to its vasodilator activity.1,10 Dihydropyranocoumarins and dihy- drofuranocoumarins from Umbelliferous plants have been shown to possess significant coronary vasodilatory, spasmolytic, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitory properties.13 The mechanism of action appears to be a result of calcium-channel antagonism. Agents that interact with calcium channels (calcium channel blockers) are involved in the treatment of wide-ranging conditions, including hypertension and angina. Umbelliferous plants, such as angelica, may offer similar effects. Angelica provides additional cardiovascular effects, including neg- ative inotropic and antiarrhythmic action.1

## Smooth Muscle–Relaxing Activity

Calcium-channel–blocking compounds are also capable of relax- ing the smooth muscles of visceral organs. Essential oil of angelica demonstrated relaxing action on the smooth muscles of the intestines and uterus, whereas the water extract produced an initial contraction and then prolonged relaxation.1,10,11 This confirms its historical use in the treatment of intestinal spasm and uterine cramps. Its action on other smooth muscles could explain its hypotensive action (vascu- lar smooth muscle) and historical use in asthma (bronchial smooth muscle).

## Analgesic Activity

Both Chinese and Japanese angelica have demonstrated pain-reliev- ing and mild tranquilizing effects in experimental studies in ani- mals.1,10,14,15 Angelica’s analgesic action was 1.7 times that of aspirin in one study.15 Several dimetric phthalides, including angesinenolides, exhibit inhibitory activity against COX-2.16 Its analgesic activity, com- bined with its smooth muscle–relaxing activity, supports its histori- cal use in such conditions as uterine cramps, trauma, headaches, and arthritis.

## Activity

Angelica has a long history of use by Chinese and Japanese herbalists in the prevention and treatment of allergic symptoms in individuals who are sensitive to various substances (e.g., pollen, dust, animal dander, food).1,17 Its action is related to its ability to inhibit the production of immunoglobulin-E in a selective manner. Because immunoglobu- lin-E levels in patients with atopic conditions are typically 3 to 10 times greater than the upper limit of normal, angelica may offer some benefit by reducing these elevated antibodies. Coumarin compounds have demonstrated immune-enhancing activity in both healthy and cancer patients.18,19 Coumarins have been shown to stimulate macrophages and increase phagocytosis, offering significant protection against metastasis and growth of tumor cells.18 Upon coumarin administration, macrophages are activated and thus capable of entering the tumor, where a specific destruction of tumor cells may occur.18,19 Coumarin compounds of angelica and the polysaccharides of the water extract of Japanese angelica have demonstrated immune-mod- ulating and antitumor activity. They have been shown to possess mitogenic activity to B lymphocytes, interferon-producing activity, antitumor activity, and activation of both classic and alternative com- plement pathways.20–24 Chinese angelica has been shown to increase murine interleukin-2 production, stimulate the reticuloendothelial system, and increase the production of tumor necrosis factor.25–27 The antitumor effects of angelica appear to result from the polysaccharide components because these compounds have been shown to exert anti- tumor effects on experimental tumor models in vivo and inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro.28–30 The time-effect relation of cytokine response also suggests that macro- phages and natural killer cells involved in nonspecific immunity were primarily activated, and helper T cells were secondarily affected by angelica polysaccharides.31 The effects by coumarins, polysaccharides, and extracts of Angelica spp. would seem to support the historical use of angelica as an adjunct in cancer therapy.

## Kidney Effects

A 24-week, prospective, multicenter, and randomized controlled trial was performed on 158 patients with primary glomerulonephritis.32 Compared with patients taking losartan, there was a significant con- tinual decrease of proteinuria in the A. sinensis group throughout the 24-week time frame of the study, and from week 16 to week 24, there was a significant reduction in proteinuria.

## Antimicrobial Activity

Extracts of Chinese angelica have been shown to possess antibacte- rial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, whereas extracts of Japanese angelica exhibited no antibacterial action.9 The inconsistency may be secondary to different essential oil concen- trations of the extracts used in the studies. The oil of A. archangelica has also exhibited significant antifungal and anthelmintic properties but virtually no antibacterial activity.4,33,34 Because other herbs have much greater antimicrobial activity, Angelica spp. would be considered a less-than-optimum antimicrobial agent.

Angelica spp. have been used worldwide to treat multiple conditions. At present, A. archangelica and A. atropurpurea are most indicated as expectorants, antispasmodics, and carminatives in the treatment of respiratory ailments, gas, and abdominal spasm. Chinese angelica (A. sinensis or polymorpha) and Japanese angelica (A. acutiloba) appear most useful in the treatment of disorders of menstruation, menopause

(especially hot flashes), atopic conditions, smooth muscle spasm (e.g., uterine cramps, migraines, abdominal spasm), and possibly as an immunostimulatory adjunct in cancer therapy.

## Menopause

By far the most popular use of Angelica spp. has been the use of A. sinensis in the treatment of menopausal complaints. Although a dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled study in women showed no significant benefit, the preparation used (a dried aqueous extract) was clearly lacking some of the important volatile compounds, although it was standardized for ferulic acid content.35 A study conducted in China showed that a combination of A. sinensis, Paeonia lactiflora, Ligusticum monnieri, Atractylodes chinensis, Sclerotium poriae, and Alisma orienta- lis was effective in roughly 70% of women experiencing menopausal symptoms.36 In an in vitro study with human bone, the aqueous extract of A. sinensis was found to directly stimulate proliferation, alka- line phosphatase activity, protein secretion, and type I collagen synthe- sis in a dose-dependent manner.37 Also, in a double-blind study, the combination of 100 mg angelica, 60 mg soy isoflavones, and 50 mg of black cohosh extract significantly reduced menstrual migraines.38 An herbal product, EstroG-100, containing a combination of standardized extracts of Cynanchum wilfordii, Phlomis umbrosa, and Angelica gigas, was tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 64 pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women.39 The constituting symp- toms of vasomotor, paresthesia, insomnia, nervousness, melancholia, vertigo, fatigue, rheumatic pain, and vaginal dryness were significantly improved in the EstroG-100 group, without weight gain or any serious side effects. The estrogenic aspect of dong quai has been called into question for women with estrogen-dependent breast cancer. In vitro studies have shown that the aqueous extract of dong quai stimulated the growth of breast cancer cells, resulting in the caution against its use in herbal preparations for the treatment of peri- or postmenopausal symptoms, especially in women with breast cancer, pending further study.40


• Dried root or rhizome: 1 to 2 g orally, or by infusion, three times a day • Tincture (1:5): 1.0 to 2 mL, three times a day • Fluid extract (1:1): 0.5 to 2 mL, three times a day


Angelica is generally considered to be of low toxicity. However, it con- tains many substances that may induce photosensitivity. This should be kept in mind when using any Umbelliferous plant. This photore- active activity can be used therapeutically in the treatment of vitiligo and psoriasis. Use of Angelica spp., particularly A. sinensis, in men may lead to gynecomastia.41


Angelica species may interfere with anticoagulants. Although ani- mal studies showed no significant variation in the pharmacokinetic parameters of warfarin after dong quai treatment for either single-dose administration or steady-state concentrations of warfarin, there was a single case report of dong quai possibly being responsible for raising the international normalized ratio in women on long-term coumadin therapy. Therefore, in patients on anticoagulant therapy, caution is advised, and monitoring is necessary.42

copper sulfate), and adding antimony chloride to create the appearance of the white precipitate formed in true absinthe.5 At the same time, a new phenomenon termed absinthism was becoming widely known. This syndrome was a result of chronic absinthe overindulgence and included bursts of violent aggressiveness followed by prolonged depression, trem- bling, hallucinations, seizures, and death.7 However, the presence of adulterated, low-quality, high-ethanol absinthe products on the market and the inability to distinguish the effects of ethanol abuse from those of other compounds in the mixture made it difficult to be certain exactly what was causing absinthism. The levels of the purported neurotoxins thujones in true absinthe were 2 to 4 mg per drink, far below the 10 mg/ kg levels needed to induce neurological damage in numerous animal experiments.8 In the early 20th century, absinthe was banned in most of Europe and the United States. Absinthe, usually with limits on thujones content, is now legal again in many places, including Europe and the United States. The Eclectics regarded wormwood as a digestive tonic useful in atonic dyspepsia, as a potential treatment for roundworms, and for topical application to sprains and bruises.9 The dangers of absinthism were well known to these turn-of-the-century American natural physi- cians, but they did not seem clear on the various problematic elements in the history of absinthe discussed previously.


The study of wormwood has focused on four major actions: digestive effects, antiparasitic effects, endocrine effects, and effects on the central nervous system. Growing evidence suggests it is also a potent tumor necrosis factor- α inhibitor. Various reported effects of isolated α - and β -thujone may also be relevant to wormwood’s effects.

## Digestive Effects

In a controlled clinical trial, wormwood tincture and thujones-free wormwood tincture were both shown to significantly increase bile and pancreatic enzyme secretion in humans, compared with water.10 The levels of secretion were assessed intraduodenally. These effects seem to be common to many bitter herbs that contain sesquiterpene lactones. Wormwood extract had a modest antidiarrheal effect in one rat model unrelated to infection.11

## Hepatic Effects

Pretreatment of mice with 500 mg/kg of wormwood extract decreased the 100% lethality of 1 g/kg acetaminophen to 20%.12 The toxicity of carbon tetrachloride was also reduced by pretreatment of rats with wormwood. Administering 500 mg/kg wormwood extract to rats 6 hours after toxic but sublethal doses of acetaminophen (but not

carbon tetrachloride) significantly reduced hepatic damage. An aque- ous extract of wormwood protected mice against carbon tetrachloride- and immune-mediated liver damage, partly by reducing oxidation and partly by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α and interleukin-1.13

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiparasitic Effects

Wormwood does not appear to contain the same active constituents as sweet Annie (Artemesia annua), notably artemisinin, yet aqueous extracts of wormwood showed antimalarial effects in vitro.14 In mice, oral administration of extracts using 95% ethanol of wormwood was shown to have a potent schizonticidal effect against Plasmodium ber- ghei, although not as potent as chloroquine.15,16 Activity of wormwood against multidrug-resistant P. falciparum has been demonstrated in vitro.16 Crude extracts of wormwood have been reported to inhibit other organisms in vitro or in animals, including Trypanosoma brucei, Trichinella spiralis, Leismania amazonensis, Hymenolepsis nana, Naegleria fowleri, and Toxocara cati.17–23 Crude extract of wormwood was ineffective at treating infection with the nematode Haemonchus contortus in gerbils, although infusions and tinctures were effective at treating this infection in sheep and calves.24,25 Apparently, research in India has shown an effect for wormwood against Entamoeba histolytica, but details of this publication could not be obtained.26

## Endocrine Effects

Wormwood has repeatedly been shown to be antidiabetic and hypo- glycemic in multiple animal models of diabetes.27–30 Contrary to the picture of thujones as largely harmful, a mixture of α - (70%) and β -thujone (20%) 5 mg/kg/day normalized lipid levels in diabetic rats, with no reported adverse effects.31 A mixture of green tea and worm- wood has been shown to both enhance glycemic control and lower ele- vated lipid levels.

## Neurological Effects

Structural and biosynthetic similarities have long been noted among α - and β -thujone and tetrahydrocannabinol from Cannabis sativa (marijuana).32 Although thujones weakly bind cannabinoid receptors in animals and human receptors in vitro, they do not appear to activate them.33 Wormwood oil also lacked significant cannabimimetic activity in this assay. Thujones’ purported hallucinogenic and epileptogenic effects have been disproven except at extremely high concentrations, and “absinthism” has been largely proven to be a result of alcohol- ism.34,35 An 80% ethanol extract of wormwood was a strong musca- rinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptor agonist in vitro.36 Methanol extracts of wormwood at concentrations of 100 to 200 mg/kg signifi- cantly reduced memory loss and motor incoordination after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.37


Wormwood was officially approved by the German Commission E for the treatment of patients with dyspepsia, loss of appetite, and biliary dyskine- sia.38 Human research showing that wormwood could increase digestive secretions supports the use of wormwood for loss of appetite, although much more specific work is necessary for definitive proof of efficacy.10 Two preliminary open trials have found wormwood teas effective for reducing symptoms and serum transaminase levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B.39,40 Neither found adverse effects of using up to 6 g per day for 4 weeks. One randomized, single-blind trial found that wormwood was not more effective than placebo for patients with non- alcoholic fatty liver disease.41 A randomized, double-blind clinical trial of Crohn’s disease found that wormwood extract, standardized to 0.2% to 0.38% absinthin and 0.25% to 0.52% total volatile oil (without thujone), in a base of rose petal, cardamom, and mastic gum or ginger (500 mg three times per day), was more effective than placebo at preventing relapse at 20 weeks.42 All patients were tapered off corticosteroids after 2 weeks on the medication. At a dose of 750 mg three times per day, this same extract has been shown to lower TNF- α levels in patients with Crohn’s disease over 6 weeks.43 In an uncontrolled trial, the same extract mentioned earlier, at a dose of 600 mg three times per day in 10 patients with immunoglob- ulin-A nephropathy not responding to immunosuppressive medica- tions, was effective at decreasing proteinuria and blood pressure over 6 months.44 Glomerular filtration rate remained stable, and there were no adverse effects. Wormwood ointment, liniment, and piroxicam were compared in a double-blind, randomized noninferiority trial in adults with knee osteoarthritis.45 After application of the assigned medication three times daily for 28 days, all groups had improved significantly com- pared with baseline; there was no significant difference between the groups on outcome measures (assessment of pain, stiffness, and phys- ical function). All treatments were very safe. In a small clinical trial, 32 Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes were treated with either Gymnema sylvestre (gurmar), Citrullus colocynthis (bitter apple), wormwood, or placebo capsules for 30 days, all at a dose of 500 mg twice per day.46 Blinding and randomization were not described. All three herbs significantly decreased fasting blood glucose compared with placebo, with no significant changes in lipid levels.


Wormwood is primarily used in three forms—tea, tincture, and cap- sule. Volatile oil should not be used. A typical dose of tea is 1 g (1–2 tsp) dried leaf and flower per cup of water, steeped for 10 to 15 min- utes.47 The tea should be covered during steeping to retain as many volatile constituents as possible. A cup of tea is sipped before meals three times daily. Thujones are water insoluble, so aqueous extracts of the plant are generally low in thujones. A typical dose of tincture is 0.5 to 1 mL three times daily mixed with 2 to 4 oz water, sipped before meals. A typical capsule dose is 2 to 3 g/day in divided doses.48 Daily thujone intake should be <0.1 mg/kg/day.49


Although much toxicity is ascribed to wormwood, it now appears that this is largely the result of poor research methodology in the early 20th century and improperly conflating thujones, wormwood volatile oil, and absinthe.34 Any toxicity attributed to the use of various forms of the beverage absinthe must not be confused with the use of teas or tinctures in medicinal doses. Alpha-thujone is considered a neurotoxin and convulsant compound, although these effects are only seen at supratherapeutic doses.2,50 Beta-thujone, present in much higher levels in wormwood, is generally considered much less toxic.51 In mice, α - and β -thujone both antagonized γ -aminobutyric acid-A receptors and induced seizures.52 Alpha-thujone was a much stronger convulsant than β -thujone in this study. This study confirmed previous findings that thujone is rapidly metabolized by the liver and removed from the body in animals.53 A 31-year-old man who drank 10 mL of wormwood volatile oil, mistakenly believing it was identical to absinthe, became agitated, belligerent, and incoherent and developed tonic-clonic seizures.54 Haloperidol improved his mental function, but acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis were discovered, becoming worse a day later.

## 436SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Seventeen days after discharge from the hospital, he had recovered completely. More recently, another case was reported of a 53-year- old woman who drank an unspecified amount of wormwood tea and developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure; she recovered completely.55 A 31-year-old woman who drank wormwood tea was reported to develop disorientation, amnesia, and fever but recovered completely.55 These effects have never been documented to occur in patients being treated with reasonable doses of medicinal extracts of or crude wormwood. In one naturopathic medical practice, nine patients over a 3-year period were identified who had been treated with a bitters formula including 11% tincture of wormwood, generally as a treat- ment for dyspepsia or malabsorption.56 Administered at a dose of teaspoon (5 mL) three times daily, patients would have been exposed to approximately 0.5 mL wormwood tincture three times daily for weeks to months. For the eight patients with available laboratory data, there was no evidence of renal, hepatic, or other damage. One patient showed improvement in serum liver enzyme levels while taking the bitters formula. None of the patients developed seizures or other signs or symptoms of neurotoxicity. Although retrospective, this study did support the notion that wormwood in this form and at this dose is safe for use in adults as a digestive aid. Thujones stimulate 5-aminolevulinate synthase in vitro, leading to large increases in porphyrin levels.57 Although it seems likely that porphyrogenic levels of thujones could be achieved by drinking large volumes of absinthe or volatile oil, levels of intake of tincture, tea, or capsules of wormwood are far lower and unlikely to lead to such high levels. Porphyrogenic effects have not been clearly documented to be induced by wormwood in humans, although thujones and thu- jone-containing herbs such as wormwood should be avoided by people with porphyria until more information is available.


No confirmed drug interactions exist for wormwood. It should be avoided in combination with chronic ethanol abuse due to historic reports pertaining to absinthe. Given the low doses of tinctures used, this should not represent any health threat related to ethanol ingestion. Wormwood could theoretically have synergistic porphyrogenic effects with other drugs that can induce porphyric attacks, including barbitu- rates, hydantoins, and carbamazepine.

## Antineoplastic Effects

Mounting evidence suggests that artemisinin compounds have potent anticancer activity. Artemisinin and quercetagetin 6,7,3 ′ ,4 ′ -tetramethyl ether, a flavonoid found in sweet wormwood, both showed activity against several tumor types in vitro.17 Dihydroartemisinin and arte- sunate have also been investigated and found to inhibit cancer cells significantly in vitro.18,19 The presence of ferrous iron appears to be essential for this activity, and sufficient quantities of iron may be nec- essary to prevent cancer cells from becoming resistant to artemisinin compounds.18,20 A combination of ferrous sulfate and dihydroartemisinin proved effective at limiting the growth of implanted fibrosarcomas in rats.21 The combination did not appear to cause adverse effects. Ferrous sul- fate or dihydroartemisinin administered alone was not effective in this model.

## Malaria

A meta-analysis confirmed that artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artesunate, and arteether are potent, effective, and safe in patients with uncomplicated malaria compared with other anti- malarial agents.22 In cases of severe or cerebral malaria, these agents appeared to be at least as effective as quinine.23 No artemisinin com- pound has been shown to work better than any other, although there is a relative dearth of studies examining this question. It should be noted that most trials have been conducted in Southeast Asia, an area with a high incidence of multidrug-resistant malaria. Profligate use of artemisinin and derivatives by itself (instead of coupled with other drugs and measures as should be) is associated with rising resistance to these agents (Fig. 55.1).24 Tú Y ō uy ō u won the Nobel prize for medicine and physiology for her part in the discovery of artemisinin for malaria—the first Chinese woman to win any Nobel prize, and she did so without a postgraduate degree, without ever working outside of China, and without belonging to any scientific academies. Rising artemisinin resistance, which occurs for a wide range of rea- sons including widespread sales of counterfeit drug, use of single arte- misinin instead of combination therapy, and the expense of the drug, has led to a new approach to malaria. This approach uses whole sweet wormwood and not artemisinin, and as will be shown, has shown it is more effective. Based on several prior small trials,25,26 a large double-blind trial was conducted, involving 957 patients aged 5 years and older with malaria in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.26a Of these, 943 completed the trial. Participants were randomized to artesunate 4 mg/kg and amodiaquine 10 mg/kg (ASAQ) once daily for three days, an infusion of sweet wormwood providing at most 8.5 mg artemisinin per day, or an infusion of Artemisia afra (African wormwood), which had mini- mal artemisinin. Both infusions were made by adding 5 g of stem and leaf of the respective herbs to 1 L of boiled water and letting it infuse for 10 minutes. It was then strained and drunk in three equal portions throughout the day for 7 days. The dose was the same for children and adults. All patients therefore received some active treatment. They simultaneously received either a placebo tablet (in the herbal infusion groups) or a placebo infusion (made using just 0.2 g of herb, in those taking active ASAQ). On every clinical measure that matters, sweet and African worm- wood were significantly superior to artesunate-amodiaquine. Cure (defined as absence of parasitemia after 28 days) was seen in 89% of African and 96% of sweet wormwood patients, significantly supe- rior compared to just 34% of those receiving ASAQ. Fever resolution occurred within 24 hours with either herb, compared to the signifi- cantly longer 48 hours for ASAQ. After 14 days, no patient taking sweet or African wormwood had detectable gametocytes in their blood, while 2% of the drug group did not have clearance. Adverse effects occurred in significantly fewer patients taking wormwood than those taking drugs (5% vs. 43% respectively). This study calls into question the entire idea of approaching infec- tious diseases using single molecules. A significant shift of focus of research on malaria treatment and prevention should now go towards complex medicines as are found in herbs. It is particularly notable that the dramatic reduction in gametocytes could open a completely new approach to preventing malaria, as this is the form of the parasite that gets into mosquitos, completing the plasmodial life cycle.

## Schistosomiasis

Several double-blind trials conducted in China, the Ivory Coast, and Egypt proved that artemether is effective in reducing the risk of devel- oping schistosomiasis compared with placebo.27–29 Similar to the work with malaria cited above, a large double-blind trial has assessed the efficacy of sweet and African wormwood in 800 patients with schis- tosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.29a Of these, completed the trial. Patients were randomized to either take prazi- quantel 60 mg/kg daily for 3 days or the same dose of the herbal infu- sions described in the malaria section. All subjects taking praziquantel also took low-dose herb infusions (0.2 g/L) as a placebo, or if they were taking the herbal infusions at full strength, a placebo tablet. The teas were again administered for 7 days. All subjects in both herb groups had 100% elimination of eggs in their stools by day 14; this was significantly faster than by day in the praziquantel group. Egg counts dropped by 91% in both herb groups, significantly better than the 67% reduction achieved by the drug. Melena and serum eosinophil levels declined equally well in all groups; hemoglobin levels rose significantly better in the praziquan- tel and African wormwood groups compared to those taking sweet wormwood. Vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache were common (16% -27% incidence) in the praziquantel group while none of the wormwood groups suffered any significant adverse effects. These herbs should now be considered the standard of care for schistosomiasis, as they are clearly superior in every way to praziquantel based on this very large, rigorous trial.


An early case study in a 72-year-old Indian man found that artesunate intramuscularly (IM) 60 mg daily for 15 days followed by artesunate 50 mg once daily by mouth for 6 weeks reduced the size of a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by 70% and resolved symptoms.30 Several other case studies appeared in 2002, including patients with lymphoma, lung, breast, and skin cancer, suggesting that artemisinin and/or artesu- nate resulted in dramatic improvement.31 Two cases of metastatic uveal melanoma progressing under conventional chemotherapy had disease stabilization, and one was alive for over 4 years at the time of publica- tion, when artesunate was added to their programs.32 A case series of patients with prostate cancer (5 postprostatectomy) found that 7 had improvements in their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels; all were still alive and without metastasis with an average 9-month follow-up.33 The only known double-blind, randomized trial involved patients with resected colorectal cancer treated with oral artesunate

200 mg daily or placebo for 14 days before surgery and found a signifi- cantly reduced risk of cancer recurrence in those treated with artesu- nate.34 More randomized controlled trials are certainly warranted to determine the optimal dosing and efficacy of artemisinin and artesu- nate for cancer patients.

# ARTHRITIS

In a controlled trial (blinding was not described), 159 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized to take leflunomide and meth- otrexate alone or coupled with 30 g of sweet wormwood extract daily for 48 weeks.35 All measures of symptomatic relief and objective mea- sures of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and citrullinated protein antibody levels, were improved significantly more in the sweet wormwood group compared with controls. Corticosteroids were able to be used less in the sweet wormwood group compared with controls, and there were fewer adverse effects as well. A supercritical carbon dioxide extract of sweet wormwood was tested in 42 patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis.36 This dou- ble-blind, randomized trial compared 75 mg or 150 mg twice daily of the extract with placebo over 12 weeks. Only the low-dose extract group had significant improvements in symptoms, particularly pain, compared with baseline. Between-group comparisons were unfortu- nately not provided, raising concerns that neither dose of the extract may have been superior to placebo. In an open-label extension of this trial, 28 patients completed an additional 6 months of treatment, and it was found that the benefits seen in the double-blind portion were maintained, with no significant adverse effects.37 A

## Antioxidant Response

No ubiquitination Mutated K13 Mitochondrion Fig. 55.1 Proposed mechanisms of artemisinin resistance. (A) Relevant biochemical pathways. In ring-stage parasites, artemisinin is primarily activated by heme produced in the process of hemoglobin digestion (1) although heme biosynthesis in mitochondria may also contribute (2). Activated artemisinins alkylate nearby proteins in an indiscriminate manner, leading to cell death (3). In artemisinin-sensitive parasites, a transcrip- tional factor with the potential to upregulate protein turnover and oxidative damage responses is bound via the K13 adaptor (4), leading to its ubiquitination and proteolysis (5). K13 mutation disrupts this binding (6), allowing the factor to enter the nucleus (7), with upregulation of a range of transcriptional responses that can mitigate the downstream consequences of artemisinins (8). (B) Proposed phenotypes associated with artemisinin resistance. The overall length and proportion of time spent in each stage appear relatively fixed in a given strain (A). By extending their ring stage (B), parasites increase the period of reduced vulnerability to artemisinins. An alternative is to increase the proportion of parasites entering dormancy (C), a natural phe- nomenon observed in all parasite strains that allows escape from relatively short-duration artemisinin expo- sures in patient treatments. Finally, increasing the proportion of parasites that differentiate into gametocytes (D) at a given timepoint could improve the chances of transmission before treatment is administered.

## 440SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


The historical dosage of sweet wormwood tea is 5 g/1 L water in three to four divided doses, although doses of up to 30 g daily have also been used.20,35 The dose of a 1:5 tincture of dried leaf is difficult to extrapo- late because a higher ethanol concentration (60%–70%) could be used, which would greatly improve the ability of the solvent to draw artemis- inin into the final product. A rough estimate would be 1 to 3 mL three times a day for a healthy adult. The usual dose of isolated artemisi- nin as a prescription drug for uncomplicated malaria is 500 to mg/day for 5 days.20,38 Food does not appear to significantly affect the absorption of artemisinin.39 Artemisinin and sweet wormwood should not be used for more than 5 to 7 days continuously because they stop being absorbed and stop working at that point.


The only common adverse effects from the use of sweet wormwood are nausea, loss of appetite, and dizziness.38 Vomiting is rare. Neurotoxic effects have been observed in experimental animals treated with arte- misinin derivatives and in a small handful of humans.40 These effects have not been observed during the use of whole sweet wormwood or its extracts. Sweet wormwood should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation until more data are available regarding its safety in these sit- uations. Artemisinin derivatives have frequently been used safely in children, particularly when administered by suppository.41 A single case of encephalopathy has been reported in one breast cancer patient being treated with artemisinin.42


Artemisinin compounds generally show more rapid parasite clear- ance and fever reduction when combined with mefloquine than either agent given by itself, according to a meta-analysis of clinical trials.18 Mefloquine’s neurological toxicity does not appear to be altered by combination with artemisinin compounds, although the tendency to induce severe vomiting may be slightly lessened. Artemisinin compounds can be combined safely with doxycycline and tetracycline, according to the results of two clinical trials, although at least one of these trials suggested the combination was less effective than artemether combined with mefloquine.43,44 Another double-blind trial found that the combination of artesunate and tetracycline was equally effective and much safer than quinine and tetracycline.45 Artemisinin may interfere slightly with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. In one trial, artemisinin by itself led to insignificantly more rapid par- asite clearance than artemisinin combined with sulfadoxine-pyrimeth- amine.46 Fever relief was achieved equally rapidly, and adverse effects were absent in both groups. Further research is necessary to determine for certain if there is any negative effect from combining these two agents. Grapefruit juice initially increases the bioavailability of oral arte- mether, although it does not stop the inevitable decline in bioavailabil- ity of this compound that occurs with repeated dosing over a few days.47 Single case studies suggest that artesunate may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity in cancer patients being treated with the drug temozolomide.48

## Propolis

The primary use of propolis has been in immune system enhance- ment and infections. Propolis has inherent antimicrobial activity that protects the hive block from viruses, bacteria, and other organisms. Propolis has shown considerable antimicrobial activity in in vitro studies.8–10 Propolis also stimulates the immune system, according to preliminary human studies.11,12 In vitro and animal studies have also shown that propolis exerts some antioxidant, liver-protecting, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties.13–17 A key use of propolis is protecting against and shortening the duration of the common cold. A preliminary human study reported that propolis extract (PE) reduced upper respiratory infections in children.11 In a dou- ble-blind study of 50 patients with the common cold, the group taking PE became symptom-free far more quickly than the placebo group.18 Another possible application of propolis is in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. An anecdotal article described an interesting case of ulcerative colitis that responded to propolis therapy.19 The author suggested that the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of propolis might be of value in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. The antimicrobial properties of propolis may also help protect against parasitical infections in the gastrointestinal tract. One prelimi- nary study of children and adults with giardiasis showed a 52% rate of successful parasite elimination in children and a 60% rate in adults in those given PE (amount not stated).20 However, these results are not as impressive as those achieved with conventional drugs used against giar- diasis, so propolis should typically not be used alone for this condition. Propolis may also have an effect on vaginal infections. In one study, 97 vaginal yeast strains were evaluated for susceptibility to nystatin and PEs. All the yeasts tested were inhibited by low concentrations of PE (maximum of 393.19 mcg/mL of the total flavonoid content), includ- ing an isolate resistant to nystatin, regardless of the clinical conditions of the women and the species of yeast isolated.21 Propolis has exerted many positive effects on the oral cavity in clinical studies. This includes its use as a mouthwash, showing benefits in reduc- ing dental plaque22 and gingivitis,23 healing oral wounds,24 improving periodontal pocket depths in type 2 diabetics,25 and reducing the severity and promoting the resolution of oral mucositis associated with chemo- therapy.26 In the study on oral mucositis, on day 7 of the study, there were significant differences in the incidence rates of oral wounds, muco- sitis, and oral cavity erythema between the propolis group and the pla- cebo group, with 65% of the propolis group having complete healing. Propolis has also been shown to exert some benefit in type 2 dia- betes in terms of improvement in blood sugar control, periodontal health, antioxidant activity, and healing of foot ulcers (topical use). However, the degree of absolute improvement in any of these areas is not sufficient on its own. For example, in one double-blind study, a dosage of 900 mg per day of propolis showed statistically significant advantage over the placebo, but after 12 weeks, the fasting blood sugar only dropped from an average of 152 to 134 mg/dL, and the glyco- sylated hemoglobin A1C only dropped from 8.2% to 7.4%.27 Neither of these improvements reached targeted goals in type 2 diabetes. Similar results were seen in another study using a dosage of 400 mg per day of a propolis product.25 Nonetheless, propolis appears a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with problems with blood sugar control. Finally, one of the key components of propolis, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, has been shown to exert selective estrogen-receptor modulation.28 This action, along with inhibition of receptor activator nuclear factor- κ B ligand (RANKL)-activated signaling, implied that it might be an effective agent against osteoporosis. RANKL is essential for osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival. Low concen- trations of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (<1 mcM) dose-dependently inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in cell and bone mar- row macrophage cultures, as well as decreasing the capacity of human osteoclasts to resorb bone.29

## Royal Jelly

Some research on royal jelly found a cholesterol-lowering effect. Specifically, 11 human studies have been published, 8 of which were double blind.30,31 Of the double-blind studies, only three used an oral preparation. An injectable form was used in the other studies. The results of a detailed analysis of the double-blind studies indicated that with oral preparations, despite shortcomings in the design of the stud- ies and lack of standardization with commercial preparations used, royal jelly decreased total cholesterol levels by about 14% in patients with moderate to severe elevations in blood cholesterol levels (initial values ranging from 210–325 mg/dL). Better results may be achieved when using higher-quality royal jelly products.


• Bee pollen: usually 1 to 3 tablespoons a day • Propolis: 100 to 500 mg three times a day • Royal jelly: 50 to 250 mg of royal jelly one to two times a day


Allergic reactions are the most common adverse reactions. If there is a known allergy to conifer and poplar trees, the use of bee products should be avoided. Allergic reactions can range from mild (e.g., mild gastrointestinal upset) to severe (e.g., asthma, anaphylaxis [shock], intestinal bleeding, and even death in people who are extremely aller- gic to bee products).32


No drug interactions have been reported.

in various animal foods such as salmon and other fish, egg yolks, shellfish, milk, and poultry. Carotenoids are also frequently added to foods as colorants. Table 57.1 lists carotenoids with provitamin A activity found in common food sources, whereas Table 57.2 lists some important carotenoids that have no vitamin A activity. The structures of two of these, lycopene and zeaxanthin, are illustrated in Figs. 57.2 and 57.3. According to a detailed analysis of the levels of carotenoids in fruits and vegetables, lycopene is found in few.4 Table 57.3 lists the foods that contained lycopene. These values indicate that lycopene lev- els are retained in food processing. Astaxanthin is a vibrantly deep red pigment found predom- inantly in marine life. When microalgae rich in astaxanthin are consumed by salmon, lobster, shrimp, krill, and other sea life, the intense red pigmentation results in these animals having red or pink flesh or outer shells. Salmon is the richest source, with differ- ent species having different levels. Here are the levels per 6-ounce serving: Wild Sockeye salmon 6.4 mg Wild Coho salmon 3.6 mg Farmed Atlantic salmon 1.6 mg Pink salmon 1.2 mg

## Absorption

Various factors are known to influence the absorption efficacy of vita- min A and carotenoids. Although retinol does not require bile acids to assist absorption, carotenoids do. Other factors that affect vitamin A and carotenoid absorption include the following: • The presence of fat, protein, and antioxidants in the food • The presence of bile and a normal complement of pancreatic enzymes in the intestinal lumen • The integrity of the mucosal cells The absorption efficiency of dietary vitamin A is usually quite high (80%–90%), with only a slight reduction in efficiency at high doses. In contrast, β -carotene’s absorption efficiency is much lower (40%–60%), and it decreases rapidly with increasing dosage. Carotene supplements are better absorbed than the carotenes from foods.5 Supplying only β -carotene, whether natural or synthetic, may exert a detrimental effect on the absorption of other carotenes. For example, β -carotene supple- mentation has been shown to inhibit the absorption of lutein.6 Studies in humans have shown that with β -carotene supplementation, the absorp- tion of lutein can drop by more than 50%.7 Interestingly, the absorption of lutein from vegetables is five times greater than that of β -carotene.8

## Transformation in the Intestinal Mucosa

As stated earlier, of the more than 600 carotenoids that have been rea- sonably well characterized, only about 30 to 50 are believed to have pro- vitamin A activity. However, carotenoids provide the majority of dietary vitamin A for those who have the genetics for conversion. Provitamin A carotene conversion to vitamin A depends on diverse factors: • Genetics • Protein status • Thyroid hormones • Zinc • Vitamin C

The conversion diminishes as carotene intake increases and when serum retinol levels are adequate. Beta-carotene and other provitamin A carotenes were originally believed to be cleaved by carotene dioxy- genase at the 15,15’ double bond, which would yield two molecules of all-trans retinal. However, it has been established that the dioxy- genase enzyme nonspecifically attacks any one of the double bonds of the β -carotene, resulting in the formation of a corresponding apo- β - carotenal or retinal.9 The apocarotenal formed can either be degraded to retinal or absorbed. The retinal formed is then converted to retinol by retinaldehyde reductase. Uncleaved provitamin A carotenoids, apocarotenoids, and non–provitamin A carotenoids, like retinol, are transported in the chylomicra.

## Genetics of Conversion of Carotenoids to Vitamin A

Evolving research is showing that many humans are not very effective converting beta-carotene into vitamin A. The enzyme 15,15΄-mono- oxygenase (BCMO1) responsible for converting beta-carotene to vitamin A has six common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that result in the production of a slow to almost completely ineffective BCMO1.10–12

<!-- chunk -->

## Transport, Storage, and Excretion

No specific carrier protein exists in the plasma for carotenoids. These compounds are typically transported in human plasma in association with the plasma lipoproteins, particularly by low-density lipoprotein (LDL). As a consequence, patients with high serum cholesterol or LDL levels tend to have high serum carotene levels. The concentrations found in the plasma usually reflect the dietary concentration, with β -carotene typically comprising only 20% to 25% of the total serum carotene level.13 Lycopene is the most predominant carotenoid in human plasma, accounting for more than 50% of the carotenoids in human serum. Owing to its lipophilic nature, lycopene is found to concentrate in the LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein fractions and not in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions of the serum cholesterol. Interestingly, although trans-lycopene constitutes the predominant isomer in food sources, in human plasma, 50% of the total lycopene has been found as cis isomers. Whether this is due to in vivo isomeri- zation or preferential absorption of cis-lycopene is still unclear. Little is known about in vivo metabolism of lycopene. Carotenes may be stored in adipose tissue, the liver, other organs (the adrenals, testes, and ovaries have the highest concentrations), and the skin (Table 57.4). Deposition in the skin results in carotenodermia. This is a benign (and probably beneficial) state. Carotenodermia not directly attributable to dietary intake or supplementation, however, may indicate a deficiency in a necessary conversion factor (e.g., zinc, thyroid hormone, vitamin C, or protein). Astaxanthin behaves differently than other carotenoids due to its unique structural and chemical properties.14 Astaxanthin possesses six qualitative features that are important to distinguish: • It can span the entire depth of the cell membrane to protect both the external and internal cell membranes. • It crosses the blood–brain and blood–retinal barriers to provide its protective properties to the eyes and brain. • It is more easily incorporated into many cells, including skin, mus- cle, and nerves. • It does not become a prooxidant and increase free radical prolifer- ation.

# PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL

# ACTIVITY

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant Activity

In general, carotenes exert significant antioxidant activity, whereas the antioxidant activity of vitamin A is relatively minor.1 However, its antioxidant actions are specific in that they are involved primarily in scavenging singlet molecular oxygen and, to a much lesser extent, peroxyl radicals. The efficacy of the various carotenoids for physical quenching is related to the number of conjugated double bonds pres- ent in the molecule, determining their lowest triplet energy level. The most efficient singlet oxygen-quenching carotene is the open-ring carotenoid lycopene,15 whereas even more potent is the xanthophyll astaxanthin.16 The antioxidant activity of carotenes is thought to be responsible for their anticancer effects. Because aging is associated with free radi- cal damage, a hypothesis developed that carotenes may protect against aging as well. Evidence seems to support this hypothesis. It appears that tissue carotenoid content is the most significant factor in deter- mining the maximal life-span potential (MLSP) of mammalian spe- cies (r = 0.835 for 12 mammalian species, and for primates alone, r = 0.939).17 For example, the human MLSP of approximately 90 years correlates with a serum carotene level of 50 to 300 mg/dL, whereas other primates, such as the rhesus monkey, have an MLSP of approximately 34 years, correlating with a serum carotene level of 6 to 12 mg/dL. Although β -carotene has received most of the attention, many carotenoids that have either low or no vitamin A activity exert much greater protection compared with β -carotene. For example, β -carotene generates vitamin A much more efficiently than α -carotene, but α - carotene is approximately 38% stronger as an antioxidant and 10 times more effective in suppressing liver, skin, and lung cancer in animals compared with β -carotene. Even more powerful are lycopene, lutein, and astaxanthin. Studies have shown astaxanthin to exhibit the highest overall antioxidant activity.16 In singlet oxygen quenching, astaxanthin is 11 times stronger than beta-carotene. In total free radical elimina- tion, natural astaxanthin is: • 14 times stronger than vitamin E • 18 times stronger than proanthocyanins • 21 times stronger than synthetic astaxanthin • 54 times stronger than beta-carotene The antioxidant effects of carotenoids are believed to be a key mechanism of action for their role as a protective factor against in aging-related, chronic degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, strokes, cancer, macular degeneration, and neurodegen- erative diseases. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown the association with an increased intake or higher blood levels of various carotenoids and lower incidence of these diseases and aging-related disorders.

## Anti-inflammatory Activity

In addition to their antioxidant effects, many carotenoids also act directly and indirectly on many aspects of inflammation that include cellular signaling cascades, such as nuclear factor κ B (NF- κ B), mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor erythroid 2– related factor 2 (Nrf2).18 In particular, astaxanthin has shown signif- icant anti-inflammatory effects.19 These effects were quite evident in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Subjects took either astaxanthin (12 mg per day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Results showed a steady trend toward improvement in both pain levels and daily satisfaction from the beginning of the study to a midway point after 4 weeks, and then increasing improvement during the last 4 weeks of the study. By the end of 8 weeks, the pain scores had dropped by 35% in the group taking astaxanthin, and the satisfaction scores improved by 40%.20 These effects were also stud- ied in soccer players.21 In a double-blind study, 40 male soccer play- ers were randomly assigned to astaxanthin (4 mg daily) and placebo groups. After 90 days, results showed a number of benefits with astax- anthin, including a rise of salivary secretory IgA levels, a decrease in prooxidant-antioxidant balance, a decrease in muscle enzymes levels, and a significant blunting of the systemic inflammatory response as noted by C-reactive protein.

## Immune System

Carotenoids have demonstrated significant effects in enhancing immune function.22 Some of these effects are probably related to an ability to prevent stress-induced thymic involution, as well as promote thymus growth and function and increase interferon’s stimulatory action on the immune system.23 Interferon is a powerful immune- enhancing compound that plays a central role in protection against viral infections.

## Reproduction

Beta-carotene reportedly has a specific effect in fertility distinct from its role as a precursor to vitamin A. In bovine nutritional studies, cows fed β -carotene–deficient diets exhibited delayed ovulation and an increase in the number of follicular and luteal cysts.24,25 The corpus luteum has the highest concentration of β -carotene of any organ measured.26 The carotene cleavage activity changes with the ovulation cycle, with the highest activity occurring during the midovulation stage. It has been speculated that a proper ratio of carotene to retinol must be main- tained to ensure proper corpus luteum function. Because the corpus luteum produces progesterone, inadequate corpus luteum function could have significant deleterious effects. Inadequate corpus luteum secretory function is one of the characteristic features of infertile or irregular menstrual cycles, or both.27 Furthermore, reduced corpus luteum function and an increased estrogen-to- progesterone ratio has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including ovarian cysts, premenstrual tension syndrome, fibrocystic breast disease, and breast cancer.28 Because supplemental β -carotene given to cows significantly improves corpus luteum function in cows and reduces the incidence of ovarian cysts (42% in control group vs. 3% in the β -carotene group), it may have similar effects in humans. Astaxanthin has also shown benefit in improving reproductive function in animals. Human research has focused exclusively on male fertility and its effects on sperm to date. A double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized study was done in 30 couples who had been unsuccessfully trying to conceive for more than 12 months. In each couple, the men were diagnosed as being infertile according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, whereas the women showed no signs of infertility. The men in the treatment group were administered 16 mg per day of natural astaxanthin along with other antioxidants, and the men in the control group received placebos. At the end of the study, significant differences between the two groups included the following: • Sperm linear velocity increased in the astaxanthin group. • Reactive oxygen species decreased in the astaxanthin group. • Of the astaxanthin-treated couples, 54.5% got pregnant, versus 10.5% of the placebo couples. The researchers commented that the results in this trial were bet- ter than those in similar trials in which other antioxidants were used. “Functional improvement may be related to the reduction of reactive oxygen species resulting in enhancement of linear velocity and reduc- tion of DNA damage.”29

## Photoprotection

Photo-oxidative processes play a role in the pathology of light-exposed tissues, including the eyes and skin. Age-related macular degeneration affects the macula lutea of the retina, the area of maximal visual acuity. It is a major cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly in the United States. Macular pigments protect against the photo-oxidative processes, which may be related to the antioxidant activities of the macular carotenoids or their light-filtering effects. Lutein and zeaxan- thin are responsible for the coloration of the macula lutea. It is import- ant to point out that neither lycopene, α -carotene, or β -carotene is found in this tissue. Lutein supplementation has proven particularly beneficial in offering protection against macular degeneration, as well as improving visual acuity in the early stages of the disease.30 In regard to protecting the skin against oxidative damage, although clinical applications have focused on β -carotene (discussed later in the chapter), there is evidence indicating that lycopene and astaxan- thin may be better suited for this application.31,32 For example, in a double-blind trial, lycopene completely inhibited UVA1- and UVA/ B-induced upregulation of genes in the skin that are indicators of oxi- dative stress, photodermatoses, and skin aging.31

# COMMERCIAL FORMS

Six primary sources of carotenes are on the market: • Synthetic all-trans β -carotene • Beta- and α -carotene from the algae Dunaliella • Mixed carotenes from palm oil • Lutein • Lycopene • Astaxanthin Of the three sources of β -carotene, mixed carotenes from palm oil carotenes seem to be the best form (Table 57.5). Palm oil carotenes appear to give much better antioxidant protection compared with either synthetic or algal derived beta-carotene. The carotene complex of palm oil closely mirrors the pattern in high-carotene foods. In par- ticular, whereas the synthetic version only provides the trans config- uration of β -carotene, natural carotene sources like palm oil provide β -carotene in both a trans and cis configuration: • 60% β -carotene (both trans and cis isomers) • 34% α -carotene • 3% γ -carotene • 3% lycopene Palm oil carotenes are absorbed about 4 to 10 times better than synthetic all-trans β -carotenes.32–35 Carotenes from Dunaliella have also been shown to be well absorbed.36 The widespread health con- cerns over the use of “tropical oils” like palm and coconut do not apply to carotene products extracted from palm oil because the fat content is minimal. In addition, the real problem with palm oil occurs when it is processed (i.e., partially hydrogenated).

## 447CHAPTER 57 Beta-Carotene and Other Carotenoids

Lutein is derived primarily from marigold flowers, whereas lyco- pene is derived from tomato extracts. Astaxanthin is most often derived from Haematococcus pluvialis, an astaxanthin-rich type of algae. Although astaxanthin is found in certain fish oil supplements such as salmon, herring roe, or krill oil, the amounts in these sources are much lower than those provided from extracts of H. pluvialis. For example, the level of astaxanthin naturally occurring in a capsule of salmon or krill oil is in the range of 100 mcg (0.1 mg). That amount is not much compared with the 4 to 12 mg per capsule found in most astaxanthin supplements derived from H. pluvialis. There are other sources of astaxanthin on the market, but these forms are produced from either chemical synthesis or from genetically modified yeast (Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, formerly Phaffia rhodozyma). These synthetic forms are approved as feed additives and are often fed to salmon in fish farms to give them red flesh, but the synthetic forms dif- fer in stereochemistry and esterification. The synthetic form is also times less effective as an antioxidant, so it is unlikely to have the same benefits as natural astaxanthin.37


The primary clinical applications of carotenoids are as follows: • Prevention of cancer • Prevention of cardiovascular disease • Prevention of cognitive decline and dementia • Macular degeneration and visual processing (see Chapter 195, Macular Degeneration) • Immune enhancement • Vaginal candidiasis • Photosensitivity disorders Although there is great overlap, it is important to understand that each carotenoid that may exert greater benefit in specific clinical indications.

## Prevention of Cancer

Most epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between dietary beta-carotene intake and various cancers, especially those involving epithelial tissues (e.g., lung, skin, uterine cer- vix, gastrointestinal tract, and breast cancer).38–42 The epidemiological association is much stronger for beta-carotene than for vitamin A. This may reflect beta-carotene’s superior antioxidant, immune-potentiat- ing, and anticarcinogenic activity. Here is an important consideration. Although most of the epidemi- ological studies employed dietary questionnaires to determine intake, when blood levels were used instead, the results were even better for carotene intake reducing cancer risk. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of dietary intake and blood con- centrations of carotenoids and breast cancer risk, beta-carotene intake as determined by dietary questionnaire was associated with a reduced breast cancer risk with a relative risk (RR) of 0.95. In contrast, the sum- mary RR for blood concentrations of μ g beta-carotene/dL was 0.82. Interestingly, only beta-carotene was associated with a reduction in RR of the six dietary carotenes assessed in this analysis (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein/zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids). Although there is no argument that a diet high in carotenes protects against cancer, the big question is: “Can β -carotene supplementation reduce the risk of cancer?” The answer appears to be that synthetic β -carotene supplementation does not. Three highly publicized reports on cancer prevention trials featuring synthetic all-trans β -carotene in high-risk groups produced negative results. Taking a close look at each of these studies is important to help put things into perspective.

## Prevention Study Group

This study’s population was 29,000 men in Finland who smoked and drank alcohol.43 The men were given β -carotene (20 mg/day) or vita- min E, or both. The results of this study indicated an 18% increase in lung cancer in the β -carotene group. This result was not totally unexpected, as studies in primates demonstrated that when ani- mals were fed alcohol and β -carotene, they experienced an increase in liver damage as a result of oxidative damage.44 Other researchers have pointed out that β -carotene is susceptible to oxidative damage.45 The protection against the oxidative damage of β -carotene is the pres- ence of other antioxidant nutrients.46 The absence of these protective nutrients could result in the formation of cancer-causing compounds, stressing the importance of relying on foods and broader-spectrum nutritional antioxidant support. Adding support to this statement is the fact that the group receiving both β -carotene and vitamin E did not show an increase in cancer. In the group not receiving β -carotene supplements, there was a strong protective effect of high dietary β - carotene and blood carotene levels against lung cancer. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the protection offered by β -carotene is only apparent when other important antioxidant nutrients are pro- vided and may not be provided by the synthetic forms.

## Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial

The second trial reporting on the role of β -carotene in a high-risk group is the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET).47 This study comprised more than 18,000 U.S. male and female smokers and

asbestos workers. It was halted 21 months prematurely in January after 4 years of intervention indicated that β -carotene supplementation (30 mg/day) increased lung cancer by 28% and overall deaths by 17%. Although this appears dramatic, a closer look at the numbers and per- centages puts them into proper perspective. Among active smokers, the risk of lung cancer during the CARET study was 5 per 1000. The 28% increase found with β -carotene supplementation increased this number to roughly 6 per 1000.47 Interestingly, once again in the group not taking β -carotene, the lowest rate of cancer was found among individuals with the highest blood β -carotene levels, and in former smokers, β -carotene supple- mentation actually reduced cancer risk by 20%.

## The Physician’s Health Study

The Physician’s Health Study was composed of 22,071 U.S. male phy- sicians who took either 50 mg of β -carotene or a placebo every other day for 12 years. Results demonstrated no significant effect—positive or negative—on cancer or cardiovascular disease, even in the group (11%) that smoked.48

## General Comments on the “Negative” Studies

Although scientific research is clear that diets high in antioxidants are protective against many cancers, the data are not as solid with antiox- idant supplements. Three main points should be kept in mind when discussing research with antioxidants: • The antioxidant system of the body relies on a complex interplay of many different dietary antioxidants. • Taking any single antioxidant nutrient is not enough. Total pro- tection requires a strategic, comprehensive dietary and supplement program. • Although dietary supplements are important, they cannot replace the importance of consuming a diet rich in antioxidants. A shortcoming of many dietary studies is that researchers often focus on the effects of just one factor. In a way, this is like judging an entire symphony by listening to a single trombone. Such research has its value, but it is not complete and often raises more questions than it answers. Another issue is that not all antioxidants are created equal. When it comes to quenching free radicals, each may have a somewhat different (and usually narrow) range of activity. For example, β -carotene is an effective quencher of a free radical known as singlet oxygen but is vir- tually powerless against the dozens of other types of free radicals. As a result, it has a narrow range of benefit and is susceptible to being dam- aged itself and forming a free radical without additional antioxidant support. Most antioxidants require some sort of “partner” antioxidant that allow them to work more efficiently. Additionally, research has shown that β -carotene itself can become damaged if used alone (i.e., without its partner antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium). For example, although studies showed that synthetic β -carotene sup- plements given alone actually increased the risk of cancer in smok- ers, when β -carotene was given along with vitamin E and selenium, it reduced cancer deaths by a significant 13%.43 Damaged β -carotene is extremely toxic to the liver, the lining of the arteries, and the lungs. This fact alone may explain some of the disappointing results from recent β -carotene studies. The results of these three studies indicate that synthetic β -carotene supplementation may have adverse effects in high-risk groups for can- cer and cardiovascular disease. These studies do not invalidate the hun- dreds of studies showing the preventive effect of a diet rich in carotenes and nutritional antioxidants against cancer and cardiovascular disease. These results seem to indicate the need for a diet high in carotenes, and if carotene supplementation is desired, people should not smoke, natural forms should be used, and the β -carotene needs to be protected against the formation of toxic derivatives by taking extra vitamins C and E and selenium. That said, even studies with β -carotene supple- mentation that also used additional vitamins C and E failed to show a protective effect against either cancer or cardiovascular disease.49,50

## Other Prospective Cancer Prevention Studies

In addition to these three highly publicized studies, several prospective and double-blind studies have shown promising results. In particular, β -carotene supplementation is especially effective in the treatment of early cancerous lesions of the oral cavity and esophagus.51,52 Although β -carotene has been shown to exert these benefits on its own (in dos- ages ranging from 15–180 mg/day), one of the most positive studies showing a reduction in cancer risk with supplemental β -carotene to date is one that featured a broader supplement program. The Linxian Cancer Chemoprevention Study was a prospective study of 30,000 rural Chinese adults. In one substudy, subjects received one of four supplement programs: • Retinol and zinc • Riboflavin and niacin • Vitamin C and molybdenum • Beta-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium (dosages one to three times greater than the U.S. recommended daily allowance) The latter group demonstrated a 13% decrease in cancer deaths and a reduction of 9% in overall deaths.53,54 These results again support the notion that a combination of antioxidants is superior to high levels of any single antioxidant.

## Lycopene in Prostate Cancer

In one of the first detailed studies of lycopene protection against cancer, Harvard researchers discovered that men who consumed the highest levels of lycopene (6.5 mg/day) in their diet showed a 21% decreased risk of prostate cancer compared with those eating the lowest levels.55 Men who ate two or more servings of tomato sauce each week were 23% less likely to develop prostate cancer during the 22 years of the study than men who ate less than one serving of tomato sauce each month. In addition to a protective effect, lycopene may exert a thera- peutic effect as well. In a study of patients with existing prostate can- cer, lycopene supplementation (15 mg/day) was shown to slow tumor growth, shrink the tumor, and lower the level of prostate-specific anti- gen (PSA), a marker of cancer activity, by 18%.56 In another study, the efficacy of lycopene (4 mg/day) plus orchi- dectomy was compared with orchidectomy alone in the management of advanced prostate cancer.57 Fifty-four patients with histologically confirmed metastatic prostatic cancer and a performance status of 0 to 2 (WHO) were entered into the trial. At 6 months there was a signifi- cant reduction in PSA level in both treatments, but it was more marked in the lycopene group (mean 9.1 and 26.4 ng/mL). After 2 years, these changes were more consistent in the lycopene group (mean 3.01 and 9.02 ng/mL). Eleven (40%) patients in the orchidectomy-alone group and 21 (78%) in the lycopene group had a complete PSA response, with a partial response in 9 (33%) and 4 (15%) and progression in 7 (25%) and 2 (7%), respectively. Bone scans showed that in the orchidectomy arm, only 4 (15%) patients had a complete response ver- sus 8 (30%) in the lycopene group, with a partial response in 19 (70%) and 17 (63%) and progression in 4 (15%) and 2 (7%), respectively. Of the 54 patients who entered the trial, 19 (35%) died: 12 (22%) in the orchidectomy group and 7 (13%) in the lycopene group. Researchers concluded that adding lycopene to orchidectomy produced a more reliable and consistent decrease in serum PSA level; it not only shrunk the primary tumor but also diminished the secondary tumors, pro- viding better relief from bone pain and lower urinary tract symptoms

and improving survival compared with orchidectomy alone. Lycopene appears to be most useful in the early stages of prostate cancer because no clinically relevant benefits were shown for patients with advanced stages of the disease in one clinical trial. Lycopene also does not appear to be effective for androgen-independent prostate cancer.58 Lycopene does, however, appear to be helpful in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). In one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with histologically proven BPH free of prostate cancer were randomized to receive either lycopene at a dose of 15 mg/day or pla- cebo for 6 months.59 The primary end point of the study was the inhi- bition or reduction of increased serum PSA levels. Symptoms of the disease, as assessed via the International Prostate Symptom Score ques- tionnaire, were improved in both groups, with a significantly greater effect in men taking lycopene supplements. In a 6-month repeat-biopsy randomized trial among men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), 58 partici- pants consumed a placebo or lycopene (30 mg/day). Pre- and posttreat- ment biopsies were immunostained and digitally scored. Pathologists blindly reviewed each biopsy to score histologic features. There were no meaningful differences between the groups in PSA, IGF-1, or IGF- binding protein 3 concentrations, nor any significant differences in expression of MCM-2 or p27 in epithelial nuclei or prevalence of can- cer. However, more extensive atrophy and less extensive HGPIN was more common in the lycopene group.57 Despite large differences in serum lycopene after intervention, no treatment effects were apparent on either the serum or benign tissue end points. Larger studies are war- ranted to determine whether changes observed in the extent of HGPIN and focal atrophy can be replicated.

## Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease

Just as in the case of cancer prevention, although a high intake of carotene-rich foods appears to be protective, the same may not be true for supplementation with synthetic β -carotene.1–3,60,61 Double-blind trials wherein people were supplemented with β -carotene alone or placebo have not found benefit for synthetic β -carotene supplementa- tion.61 Three of four trials reported a higher risk of cardiovascular dis- ease in the β -carotene groups compared with those receiving placebo. Again, a major issue with much research on carotenes in cardio- vascular disease protection has been the focus on β -carotene. It may not be the most important marker of protection. A large clinical study evaluating the relationship between carotene status and heart attack (acute myocardial infarction) found that lycopene, but not β -carotene, was protective.62 Lycopene, lutein, and astaxanthin exert greater anti- oxidant activity compared with β -carotene in general but specifically against LDL oxidation.63–65 Beta-carotene is likely of less importance compared with many other carotenes, especially lycopene, astaxanthin, and lutein, because it does not get incorporated into LDL effectively, although it may help protect the endothelium. These other carotenoids exert more signifi- cant effects. For example, lutein is especially important in protecting against LDL oxidation. On the basis of analysis of the different sub- types of LDL, it has been found that lycopene, β -carotene, and cryp- toxanthin were mainly located in the larger, less dense LDL particles, whereas astaxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin were found preferentially in the smaller, denser LDL particles.63,66 Because the smaller, denser LDL subtype is most easily oxidized, astaxanthin, lutein, and zeaxan- thin are particularly important in protecting against damage to LDL cholesterol. Despite the focus on protecting LDL cholesterol from damage, it appears that the protective effect of carotenoids against the develop- ment of atherosclerosis does not occur early in the progression (i.e., they exert little effect on protecting against oxidative damage to LDL cholesterol) but, rather, later on by some undetermined mechanism. This conclusion is based on studies indicating that carotenoid- enriched diets are associated with less atherosclerotic plaque formation.

## Prevention of Cognitive Decline and Dementia

Astaxanthin exerts a number of key protective mechanisms against age-related decline in cognitive function. Because astaxanthin can cross the blood–brain barrier, and because it is a strong and high-quality antioxidant and has anti-inflammatory actions as well, it is logical that it should help prevent neurologic impairment associated with aging because these conditions are directly related to oxidation and inflam- mation in the brain. Astaxanthin also promotes neurogenesis and plasticity, factors that decline with aging. Neurogenesis is now widely accepted to occur throughout adulthood, primarily in the hippocam- pus, the key area of the brain essential for learning and memory.67 This ability to directly affect neurogenesis and plasticity in the hip- pocampus is an emerging explanation for some of the observed effects with astaxanthin supplementation. Effects include not only delaying or ameliorating the cognitive impairment associated with normal aging but also improving cognitive function as well. For example, in one double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 96 healthy middle- aged or elderly subjects were randomly to take either placebo, 6 mg of astaxanthin per day, or 12 mg of astaxanthin per day for 12 weeks. Improvements in the CogHealth battery score were found in the 12-mg group after 12 weeks. Improvements were noted earlier in the Groton Maze Learning Test in both the 6-mg and 12-mg groups.68

## Immune Enhancement

Carotenes demonstrated a number of immune-enhancing effects in recent studies.27 However, these effects were demonstrated as far back as 1931, when it was found that a diet rich in carotenes, as deter- mined by blood carotene levels, was inversely related to the number of school days missed by children.69 Originally, it was thought that the immune-enhancing properties of carotenes were due to their conver- sion to vitamin A. Now it is known that carotenes exert many immune system–enhancing effects independent of any vitamin A activity. In one study, the relationship of plasma concentrations of six major carotenoids ( β -carotene, α -carotene, β -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin) with the incidence and severity of acute respi- ratory infections was determined.70 The incidence rate ratio of acute respiratory infections at high β -carotene status was 0.71 (95% confi- dence interval [CI] 0.54–0.92) compared with the group with a low β -carotene concentration. Interestingly, α -carotene, β -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin were not related to the incidence or severity of infections, indicating that β -carotene may exert the most significant immune-enhancing effects. One of the most impressive studies with supplemental β -carotene was conducted on normal human volunteers.71 Results demonstrated that oral β -carotene (180 mg/day, approximately 300,000 international units [IU]) significantly increased the frequency of OKT4+ (helper/inducer T cells) by approximately 30% after 7 days and the frequency of OKT3+ (all T cells) after 14 days.47 Because T4+ lymphocytes play a critical role in determining host immune status, this study indicates that oral β -carotene may be effective in increasing the immunologic competence of the host in conditions characterized by a selective diminution of the T4 subset of T cells, such as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cancer. However, rather than supplementing the diet with synthetic β - carotene, it may be more advantageous to use natural carotene sources or to increase the intake of carotene-rich foods. In another study, healthy college students were randomly assigned to one of the follow- ing groups: • Group A, the control group • Group B, a group that used a 15-mg (25,000 IU) β -carotene supple- ment daily

## 450SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

• Group C, a group that consumed approximately 15 mg β -carotene per day from carrots Better results (i.e., increase in white blood cell number and func- tion) were achieved in the group eating the carrots versus those taking the carotene supplement.72 Astaxanthin also demonstrates significant immune-enhancing effects. In one double-blind clinical trial in healthy, young women averaging just over 20 years old, the women were separated into three different groups: the control group took a placebo, and the two treatment groups took either 2 mg of astaxanthin per day or 8 mg per day over 8 weeks. Results showed that at either dosage, astaxanthin19: • Increases the total number of antibody-producing B cells • Amplifies the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells • Leads to increased numbers of T cells • Stimulates lymphocyte (white blood cell) counts • Significantly increases delayed-type hypersensitivity response • Dramatically decreases DNA damage • Reduces C-reactive protein (CRP), the key marker for systemic inflammation

## Vaginal Candidiasis

It is a well-established fact that women are more susceptible to vag- inal candidiasis when the immune system is depressed, which may be due to low carotene levels. Beta-carotene levels were determined in exfoliated vaginal cells in 22 women with vaginal candidiasis and compared with vaginal cells from 20 controls. The β -carotene level per 1 million cells in the women with vaginal candidiasis was 1.46 ng compared with 8.99 ng in the control group (i.e., one-sixth that of normal).73 These results, coupled with β -carotene’s known effects on enhancing the immune system, suggest that a low tissue level of β -carotene is associated with vaginal candidiasis, and a high dietary or supplemental intake of β -carotene may be protective against vag- inal candidiasis.

## Photosensitivity Disorders

Beta-carotene has become the treatment of choice for photosensitivity disorders. It is most effective in the treatment of erythropoietic pro- toporphyria (EPP).74 Its effectiveness in other photosensitivity disor- ders such as polymorphous light eruption, solar urticaria, and discoid lupus erythematosus is significant but not as great.75–79 Beta-carotene also has a small but significant effect in increasing the exposure at which manifestations of sunburn begin, thus allowing some subjects the opportunity to stay in the sun long enough to get a “tan” for the first time.79 Patients with EPP are characterized by elevated levels of porphy- rins in blood, feces, and skin and by sensitivity to visible light. This sensitivity manifests after exposure to sunlight as a burning sen- sation followed by swelling and redness. Topical sunscreens are of no value. The photosensitivity is due to excitation of the porphyrin molecule by ultraviolet radiation, resulting in the production of free radicals that are deleterious to the skin. Direct cell damage results in the release of chemical mediators, which in turn damage other cells, resulting in the manifestations of itching, burning, redness, and swelling. In EPP, it appears that carotene levels must be maintained in the blood at 600 to 800 mg/dL for optimum effects and that the protective effect is not usually observed until after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy. The actions of β -carotene and other carotenes in human tissue are simi- lar to their action in plant cells (i.e., they function as a cellular screen against sunlight-induced free radical damage).


Beta-carotene: A daily dosage of 25,000 IU (15 mg of β -carotene) appears to be reasonable for general health. Again, for the best clinical effect, it appears that natural mixed forms of carotene should be used in conjunction with a broad range of other natural antioxidants (see Chapter 108). In the treatment of EPP, the dosage is based on main- taining blood carotene levels between 600 and 800 mg/dL. • Lycopene: 15 to 30 mg daily. • Lutein/zeaxanthin: 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin • Astaxanthin: 4 to 12 mg daily.


Supplementing the diet with β -carotene has not been shown to result in any significant toxicity despite its use in high doses in the treatment of numerous photosensitivity disorders (see dis- cussion on “Photosensitivity Disorders”). Occasionally patients complain of loose stools, which usually clears spontaneously and does not necessitate stopping treatment. Elevated carotene levels in the blood do not lead to vitamin A toxicity, nor do they lead to any other significant disturbance besides yellowing of the skin (carotenodermia). The ingestion of large amounts of carrots or carrot juice (0.45–1 kg/day of fresh carrots for several years) has, however, been shown to cause neutropenia, as well as menstrual disorders.80,81 Although the blood carotene levels of these patients did reach levels (221–1007 mg/ dL) similar to those of patients taking high doses of β -carotene (typi- cally 800 mg/dL), the disturbances are due to some other factor in car- rots because neither of these effects nor any others have been observed in subjects consuming high doses of pure β -carotene (e.g., 300,000– 600,000 IU/day [180–360 mg β -carotene], which is equivalent to 4–8 lb of raw carrots) over long periods of time.82–85 Doses up to 1000 mg/ kg have been given to rats and rabbits for long periods of time, with no signs of embryotoxicity, toxicity, tumorigenicity, or interference in reproductive functions.86 There are no significant side effects or concerns with recommended levels of lycopene, lutein, or astaxanthin.


One study showed that β -carotene in combination with selenium, vita- min C, and vitamin E appeared to decrease the effectiveness of the com- bination of simvastatin (Zocor) and niacin. The researchers proposed that this inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors could reduce the effectiveness of similar drugs, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Mevacor), and pravastatin (Pravachol).87

more nutritious foods. Nevertheless, these make up 12% of the total boron intake by virtue of the volume consumed.13 Boron has also been determined to be a notable contaminant or major ingredient of many personal care products, and it (boric acid) is occasionally used as a food preservative.14 In Sydney, Australia, 32 subjects aged 20 to 53 years old were assessed over a 7-day period for their dietary intake of boron. The average boron intake in male and female subjects was found to be 2.28 ± 1.3 and 2.16 ± 1.1 mg/day, respectively.10 The boron content of selected Australian foods has been found to correlate with values in Finnish and U.S. Food and Drug Administration tables and is presented in Table 58.2 (note, however, the large variations between countries and even regions of a country).10 Regional differences are certainly important. An analysis of nearly 300 foods that are com- monly consumed in Korea found considerable discrepancies with values reported elsewhere. For example, the boron content in Korean apples was found to be one-twelfth that found in German apples. The foods found to be richest in boron (in micrograms/100 g) included buckwheat flour (828), soybeans (1642), mung beans (818), almonds (917), cocoa (2026), coffee powder (approximately 1530), and oolong and green tea powder (1274 and 1316, respectively).15

## Chemical Properties

Elemental boron was first isolated in 1808. It is the first member (atomic number 5) of the metalloid or semiconductor family of ele- ments, including silicon and germanium, and is the only nonmetal of the group IIIA elements. Like carbon, boron has a tendency to form double bonds and macromolecules.16 Boron, as boric acid, acts as a Lewis acid, accepting hydroxyl (OH−) ions and leaving an excess of protons.17 Because boron complexes with organic com- pounds containing hydroxyl groups, it interacts with sugars and polysaccharides, adenosine-5-phosphate, pyridoxine, riboflavin, dehydroascorbic acid, and pyridine nucleotides.18 Given boron’s affinity for hydroxyl groups, it is possible that it interacts with gly- coproteins and glycolipids found in cellular membranes. Animal studies have supported a role for boron in maintaining cellular membrane structure and function, with boron deprivation caus- ing pathological changes in both zebrafish and frogs.19 Dietary magnesium and essential fatty acids, both of which are involved in cell membrane function, also influence the response to boron deprivation, lending further support for a role for boron. For exam- ple, in an animal-based study, boron deprivation was found to alter animal behavior in ways that were modifiable by varying the com- position of dietary fatty acids, and vice versa, possibly by altering the fluidity of cellular membranes.20

## Biochemistry

Boron in food, sodium borate, and boric acid are well absorbed from the digestive tract.21 However, homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining serum levels of boron exist, with urinary levels mirror- ing intake.8 A boron transporter has been identified (NaBC1), and dietary supplementation of boron has been shown to alter its genetic expression.4,22 Compounds of boron are also absorbed through dam- aged skin and mucous membranes; however, they do not readily pen- etrate intact skin.23 No accumulation of boron has been observed in soft tissues of animals fed long-term low doses of boron; however, in acute poi- soning incidents, the amount of boric acid in brain and liver tissue has been reported to be as high as 2000 ppm. Within a few days of consumption of large amounts of boron, levels in blood and most soft tissues quickly reach a plateau.24 Tissue homeostasis is main- tained by the rapid elimination of excess boron, primarily in the urine, with bile, sweat, and breath also contributing as routes of elimination.18

## 453CHAPTER 58 Boron

Evidence suggests that supplemental boron does accumulate in bone; however, cessation of exposure to dietary boron results in a rapid drop in bone boron levels. The half-life of boric acid in animals is esti- mated at about 1 day.24

## Biological Functions

Boron contributes to living systems by acting indirectly as a proton donor and exerting an influence on cell membrane structure and func- tion.25 Although the absolute essentiality of boron for plants as well as two animal species (zebrafish and frogs) is well documented, stud- ies to date have not shown it to be unequivocally essential for other species or humans. However, boron supplementation has been shown to affect certain aspects of animal physiological function. In general, supplemental dietary boron has its most marked effects when the diet is deficient in known nutrients.26 Recent animal-based data suggest boron may in some way affect the utilization or production of S-adenosylmethionine, which in turn influences homocysteine metabolism, as well as other mole- cules involved in cellular signaling and differentiation. Rats deprived of boron had increases in plasma cysteine and homocysteine as well as decreases in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and the related com- pounds S-adenosylhomocysteine and spermidine. It is possible that many of boron’s biological effects are mediated through this mecha- nism because S-adenosylmethionine is involved in many methylation reactions, including DNA methylation, as well as methylation of other neurotransmitters, phospholipids, and signaling molecules, and is also used frequently as an enzyme substrate.27 Evidence suggests that boron might also have an effect on decreas- ing fasting serum glucose concentrations in postmenopausal women.28

## Embryo Maturation

Research has shown that boron is an important player in the early stages of life.3 Boron deficiency negatively affects reproductive abil- ity, as well as embryo development, in both the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) and the zebrafish. Experimentation with Xenopus noted that dietary boron deprivation elicited necrotic egg increases combined with a high frequency of abnormal gastrulation, causing adverse effects during gametogenesis, gamete maturation, embryonic development, and larval maturation.19 In the zebrafish model, 45% of boron-deprived embryos died during the early postfertilization period. Conversely, only 2% of boron-supplemented embryos died. Other studies with rats and mice corroborated that low boron status might affect reproduction in mammals, although the conclusions from these studies were not as clear.

## Life Span

Boron in an animal model has been shown to affect life span, although the process is undefined. Extremes in dietary boron, both a deficiency and an excess, appear to affect the median life span of Drosophila. Adding excess during the adult stage decreased life span by as much as 69%, whereas supplementing the diet with low levels of boron increased life span by 9.5%.29 No research exists for other species.

## Brain Function and Performance

Although limited data exist for boron’s influence on brain function, existing research is “among the most supportive in demonstrating that boron is a beneficial bioactive element for humans.”30 Brain electro- physiology and cognitive performance were assessed in response to dietary manipulation of boron (approximately 0.25 vs. approximately 3.25 mg boron/2000 kcal/day) in three studies with healthy older men and women. A low boron intake was shown to result in a decrease in the proportion of power in the α -band and an increase in the pro- portion of power in the δ -band, effects similar to those induced by heavy metals and nonspecific malnutrition, as well as mental drowsi- ness and reduced alertness. Other changes in left–right symmetry and brain-wave coherence were noted in various sites, indicating an influ- ence on brain function. When contrasted with the high boron intake, low dietary boron resulted in significantly poorer performance (P < 0.05) on tasks emphasizing manual dexterity, eye–hand coordination, attention, perception, encoding, and short- and long-term memory. Collectively, the data from these studies indicate that boron may play a role in human brain function, alertness, and cognitive performance.31 Interestingly, as mentioned previously, essential fatty acid compo- sition may interact with boron status to influence brain function. A number of biomarkers for low activity were observed in boron-defi- cient rats when given safflower oil, but fish oil negated these deficits.20

## Hematologic

Boron supplementation to human subjects who had previously fol- lowed a dietary regimen deficient in boron increased blood hemoglobin concentrations, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscu- lar hemoglobin concentration. It lowered hematocrit, red blood cell count, and platelet count.32 As discussed in the “Toxicology” section, boron may inhibit the enzyme δ -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase.

## Hepatoprotection

Studies of fulminate hepatic failure in Wistar rat models showed that boron pretreatment significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, as well as decreased serum liver enzymes, in these animals. Boron pretreatment also increased the peroxide-metabolizing enzymes’ levels of glutathi- one peroxidase and catalase, as well as glutathione itself.33,34

<!-- chunk -->

## Mineral Metabolism

Boron also affects mineral metabolism as well as related hormones in human subjects. In the first nutritional study with humans involving boron,23 postmenopausal women first were fed a diet that provided 0.25 mg boron/2000 kcal for 119 days and then were fed the same diet with a boron supplement of 3 mg boron/day for 48 days. The boron supplementation reduced the urinary excretion of calcium and mag- nesium and elevated the serum concentrations of β -estradiol and testosterone.9 In a study designed to determine the effects of boron supplemen- tation on blood and urinary minerals in athletic subjects on Western diets, findings suggested that boron supplementation modestly affected mineral status.35

# DEFICIENCY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Information on boron deficiency is limited, especially in humans. It is thought that insufficient intake of boron becomes obvious only when the body is stressed in a manner that enhances the need for it. When the diets of animals and humans are manipulated to cause functional deficiencies in nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, essential fatty acids, and methionine, a large number of responses to dietary boron occur.36 Evidence suggests that more than 21 days on a boron-deficient diet is required to demonstrate detectable effects in humans.37 The variables that are changed due to a boron-deficient diet abruptly improve about 8 days after boron supplementation is intro- duced.9 Evidence indicates that hemodialysis results in an excessive decrease in serum boron compared with controls.38 Although blood urea is by no means pathognomonic for a boron deficiency, it has been found to be slightly elevated during boron depletion.39

## Vitamin D

Considerable evidence indicates that dietary boron alleviates the per- turbations in mineral metabolism that are characteristic of vitamin D 3 deficiency.40 In one study, chicks fed a diet inadequate in vitamin D exhibited decreased food consumption and plasma calcium concen- trations and increased plasma concentrations of glucose, β -hydroxy- butyrate, triglycerides, triiodothyronine, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase activity after 26 days. Supplemental boron returned plasma glucose and triglycerides to concentrations exhibited by chicks fed a diet adequate in vitamin D.41 In rachitic chicks, boron elevated the numbers of osteoclasts and alleviated distortion of the marrow sprouts of the proximal tibial epiphysial plate, a distortion characteristic of vitamin D 3 deficiency.40,42 Higher apparent balance values of calcium, magnesium, and phospho- rus have been observed for rats fed a vitamin D–deprived diet if the diet was supplemented with boron.26 After supplementation with 3.25 mg boron daily, plasma levels of vitamin D 2 increased in men older than age 45 and postmenopausal women on low-magnesium and low-copper diets.43 In a very small human study (n = 8), healthy male volunteers were given 10 mg boron per day for 1 week, resulting in a nonsignificant 7% rise in vitamin D levels.5 Inhibition of 24-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catabolizes vita- min D, has been speculated to be the possible mechanism of action, although this has not been demonstrated.44

<!-- chunk -->

## Calcium

Boron supplementation may have a favorable effect on calcium metab- olism. A boron supplement of 3 mg/day affected several indexes of mineral metabolism of seven women consuming a low-magnesium diet and five women consuming a diet adequate in magnesium; the women had consumed a conventional diet supplying about 0.25 mg boron per day for 119 days. Boron supplementation modestly reduced the urinary excretion of calcium when dietary magnesium was low.9 In men older than age 45 and postmenopausal women, changes caused by boron supplementation included an increased concentra- tion of ionized plasma and total calcium, as well as reduced serum cal- citonin concentration and urinary excretion of calcium.43 A 1993 study demonstrated that a low-boron diet elevated urinary calcium excre- tion. The high level of calcium excretion was maintained throughout the 6-week study; however, it remained elevated even after boron sup- plementation began.45 Animal studies suggest that boron deprivation does not markedly affect the concentration of calcium (and phosphorus) in bone, but rather, it does affect the concentration of other nutrients associated with osteoblast and osteoclast function, such as magnesium, potas- sium, copper, and zinc.30

<!-- chunk -->

## Copper

Supplemental boron acts to increase serum levels of both copper and copper-dependent enzymes in humans. Boron supplementation (3 mg/day) to five men older than age 45, four postmenopausal women, and five postmenopausal women on estrogen therapy who had been fed a low-boron diet (0.23 mg/2000 kcal) for 63 days resulted in higher erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, serum enzymatic ceruloplasmin, and plasma copper.43 In a subsequent study, these same variables were again found to be higher during boron repletion than while subjects were fed a diet low in boron.46

<!-- chunk -->

## Magnesium

When magnesium deprivation is severe enough to cause typical signs of deficiency, a significant interaction between boron and magnesium is found.16 A combined deficiency of boron and magnesium causes detrimental changes in the bones of animals. Supplemental boron ele- vates plasma magnesium concentrations and enhances growth.42 Boron supplementation resulted in increased serum magnesium concentrations in human female subjects.24 Boron supplementation increased red blood cell magnesium concentrations.47 It has been shown that serum magnesium concentrations are greater in sedentary females whose diets are supplemented with boron than in exercising female athletes who are supplemented with boron.48 This finding, although unexplained to date, may indicate an increased loss of boron through urine and perspiration during exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphorous

Supplemental boron seemed to lower serum phosphorus concentra- tions in female subjects 20 to 27 years old.48 However, exercise training diminished these changes,24 again possibly indicating increased losses or an increased need for boron as a result of exercise. A low-magne- sium status, along with supplementation of boron, may depress the urinary excretion of phosphorus. This does not occur in women with an adequate magnesium intake.9

<!-- chunk -->

## Methionine and Arginine

In experimental animals, a beneficial effect is consistently observed after boron supplementation when the diet contains marginal methi- onine and excessive arginine. Among the signs exhibited by rats fed on a diet marginal in methionine and magnesium are depressed growth and bone magnesium concentration and elevated spleen weight/body weight and kidney weight/body weight ratios. Findings indicate that the severity of these symptoms is alleviated with boron supplementation.49

<!-- chunk -->

## Essential Fatty Acids

Several studies have emerged that suggest some interaction between essential fatty acids and boron. As previously mentioned, boron deprivation was shown to decrease the activity of rats and alter their brain composition, yet supplementation with fish oil (vs. safflower oil) minimized these effects.20 Similarly, boron deprivation in rats was shown to impair both bone trabecular microarchitecture and cortical bone strength. Interestingly, the use of fish oil instead of saf- flower oil was also shown to benefit both of these structural markers through a distinct mechanism, yet the benefit of fish oil was limited only to the group receiving adequate boron. In other words, a boron deficiency prevented the normal benefit of fish oil to bone.50 Lastly, as mentioned previously, boron deprivation was shown to decrease S-adenosylmethionine levels in rats. Feeding them corn oil instead of fish oil had similar effects, although they were likely mediated by a dif- ferent mechanism.50

# HORMONE INTERACTIONS

In rats, supplemental dietary boron substantially depressed plasma insulin, plasma pyruvate concentrations, and creatine kinase activity and increased plasma thyroxine (T4) concentrations. Boron supple- mentation also decreased plasma aspartate transaminase activity.51 In animal experiments, boron supplementation offset the elevation in plasma alkaline phosphatase caused by vitamin D deficiency.39 Boron supplementation in rats has also been shown to reduce plasma insulin levels, likely by increasing insulin sensitivity.52 An increase in the dietary intake of boron from 0.25 to 3.25 mg/day has been reported to increase plasma β -estradiol by more than 50% and to more than double plasma testosterone levels in postmenopausal women. The elevation seemed more marked when dietary magnesium was low.9 In a subsequent study of healthy men, boron supplemen- tation resulted in an increase in the concentrations of both plasma

estrogen and testosterone; however, not all published trials support these observations.10 Ten male bodybuilders, 20 to 26 years old, were given a 2.5-mg boron supplement for 7 weeks, whereas nine male bodybuilders, 21 to 27 years old, were given a placebo. Because both groups demonstrated significant increases in total testosterone (P < 0.01), lean body mass (P < 0.01), one-repetition maximum squat (P < 0.001), and bench pressing (P < 0.01), the authors concluded that the gains were a result of 7 weeks of bodybuilding, not of boron supplementation.53 However, in a small study of male volunteers, 10 mg supplemental boron per day was associated with an increase in plasma free testosterone and a decrease in mean plasma estradiol levels. A decrease in the inflam- matory markers C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor- α , and sex hormone–binding globulin was also seen.5 One researcher hypothesized that boron might be required for the synthesis of steroid hormones, as well as vitamin D. Because the biosynthesis of steroids such as vitamin D, testosterone, and β -estradiol involves one or more hydroxylation steps, and because of boron’s ability as a Lewis acid to complex with hydroxyl groups, boron may assist the addition of hydroxyl groups to the steroid structures.9 It has also been suggested that boron may act in an unspecified manner to protect hormones from rapid inactivation.9 The current hypothesis suggests that boron can inhibit a range of microsomal enzymes that insert hydroxyl groups near existing hydroxyls in steroids. These enzymes include those that catabolize 25-hydroxyvitamin D.54 Table 58.3 lists boron’s effect on selected hormones in either ani- mals or humans. Some of these interactions have only been demon- strated in animal models, whereas others have not been demonstrated unequivocally to date in all age and gender segments of the human population.

## Osteoporosis

A considerable body of evidence has shown that both the composi- tional and functional properties of bone are affected by boron status.55 In experimental animals, histological findings suggest that supplemen- tal boron enhances maturation of the growth plate.39 Boron has also been found at the highest concentrations in growing and calcifying areas of long bones.9 In two human studies, boron deprivation caused changes in indexes associated with calcium metabolism in a manner that could be construed as being detrimental to bone formation and maintenance; these changes were enhanced by a diet low in magne- sium.9,39 The author concluded that boron and magnesium are appar- ently necessary for optimal calcium metabolism and are thus necessary to prevent the excessive bone loss that often occurs in postmenopausal women and older men.39 At the cellular level, in vitro studies have shown that boron may play a role in the regulation of proteins in the morphogenesis of bone, including BMP-4, -6 and -7, as well as the mRNA expression of several extracellular matrix proteins.56 This is consistent with animal-based studies that suggest boron deprivation causes deficits in bone modeling and remodeling by inhibiting bone formation.57,58

## Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Regulation of

## Inflammation

A dietary boron deficiency may be a contributing factor in some cases of arthritis.59 In areas of the world where boron intake is routinely mg/day or less, the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 20% to 70%, whereas in areas where boron intake ranges from 3 to 10 mg/day, the estimated incidence of arthritis ranges from 0% to 10%.59 Analytic evidence indicates that persons with arthritis have lower boron concentrations in femur heads, bones, and synovial fluid com- pared with persons without this disorder.7 In 1961 the first anecdotal evidence suggesting that boron may be beneficial for osteoarthritis was presented when one patient had reduced swelling and stiffness and remained symptom-free for 1 year after supplementation with 3 mg of elemental boron twice daily for weeks. A human study also offered evidence that boron supplementa- tion might be beneficial in the treatment of this condition. In a dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 20 subjects with osteoarthritis, 50% of subjects receiving a daily supplement containing 6 mg of boron noted a subjective improvement in their condition. Only 10% of those receiving placebo improved during the same time interval. Greater improvement was noted in the condition of all joints (P < 0.01), as well as less pain on movement (P < 0.001), in subjects receiving the boron supplementation.60 Clinical observations indicate that children with juvenile arthritis (Still disease) improve with boron supplementation (6–9 mg/day) in 2 to 3 weeks, whereas adults with osteoarthritis may require 2 to months of supplementation before benefits are detected. Persons with rheumatoid arthritis may experience an aggravation of symptoms for to 3 weeks but generally notice improvement within 4 weeks of begin- ning boron supplementation.7 Boron also has been implicated as a potential regulator of inflamma- tory and immune responses, possibly explaining its benefit for arthritic conditions. For example, boric acid has been shown to inhibit lipopoly- saccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor- α formation.61 Other ani- mal-based studies support an anti-inflammatory role for boron.62,63

## Prostate, Lung, Breast, and Cervical Cancer

Given that boron may act as a possible modifier of the hormones tes- tosterone and estrogen, some studies have investigated its possible role in prostate cancer. One controlled case study compared the boron intake of 95 prostate cancer cases with that of 8720 male controls. After controlling for age, race, education, smoking, body mass index, dietary caloric intake, and alcohol consumption, this epidemiolog- ical screening found the risk of prostate cancer to be inversely pro- portional to dietary intake of boron in a dose-responsive manner.64 A more recent study compared the prevalence of prostate cancer among those with high exposure to boron to control populations, and although no significant difference in prevalence was found, they did find a lower prevalence of elevated prostate-specific antigens (PSAs). The authors concluded that boron may interfere with processes related

to hyperplasia and carcinogenesis.65 This is consistent with previous research that purported that boron may act as an inhibitor of PSA. It is thought that uninhibited PSA cleaves insulin-like growth factor bind- ing protein-3, providing increased local levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which then leads to tumor growth. Most epidemiological studies support a preventative effect of higher dietary boron, although not all do (the only exception used a different database for the boron content of foods).66–68 Some in vitro research observed that boric acid inhibits the pro- liferation of both the hormone-dependent and hormone-indepen- dent human prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.69 In one study, three groups of 10 mice were implanted subcutane- ously with human prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Two of the murine groups were given boric acid solutions (at 1.7 or 9 mg/kg of boron per day) by gavage, whereas the control group received only water. After 8 weeks, tumor sizes in the boric acid groups decreased by 38% and 25%, respectively, and serum PSA levels decreased by 88.6% and 86.4%, respectively, compared with the control group. Additionally, significantly less mitotic figures were seen in the boric acid groups. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated significantly less expres- sion of insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, although circulating levels were unchanged among the groups.70 Multiple mechanisms in addition to PSA inhibition have been sug- gested for boron’s chemopreventative properties, including inhibition of stored calcium release from ryanodine receptor agonist sites and induction of apoptosis.71,72 This may explain its reported benefit for other cancers as well, for in addition to prostate cancer, diets with greater amounts of boron have been associated with reduced risks of cervical cancer (cytopathologic findings) and lung cancer among women.73 A dose-dependent risk for lung cancer was seen among women, with those consuming the lowest amounts of boron having a nearly twofold greater risk compared with those in the highest quintile. Additionally, a diet low in boron height- ened the risk for lung cancer among those using hormone replacement therapy.74 A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 47 women with inva- sive ductal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy found that a boron- based gel statistically significantly relieved the pain and discomfort of radiation-induced dermatitis.75 Multiple cell-culture, animal, and pilot human studies have found benefit directly or as an adjunct in inhibition of tumor-induced angio- genesis, induction of cancer-cell apoptosis, treatment of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and decreasing the adverse effects of chemotherapy.76 For these many reasons, boron-containing compounds are increas- ingly being used for cancer care, based on a variety of mechanisms.77 Further human research is needed to determine the full clinical ben- efits of this interesting element in cancer prevention and treatment.


Boron has been shown to significantly improve wound healing in humans. Application of a 3% boric acid solution to deep wounds reduced time in intensive care by two thirds.78 In vitro research showed that a boric-acid solution improved wound healing through action on the extracellular matrix.79 These beneficial effects are apparently due to the promotion of the activity of elastase, trypsin-like enzymes, collage- nase, and alkaline phosphatase.

## Dysmenorrhea

In a triple-blind randomized clinical trial study of 113 university stu- dents, 10 mg/day of boron from 2 days before the menstrual flow until its third day resulted in significant reduction in severity and duration of pain. The study followed the women for only two cycles, which is unfortunate because the improvement increased by cycle, suggesting that further benefit above the 20% found in the second cycle may be possible.80


The optimal dose of boron for the prevention of osteoporosis and proper physiological function appears to be between 1 and 6 mg/day. It is best to obtain boron by means of a diet abundant in fruits, vegeta- bles, legumes, and nuts, but persons whose diets are limited may need a supplement containing 1 to 3 mg of elemental boron. In patients with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, a trial period of 2 to 4 months with a dose of 3 mg of boron two to three times daily seems to be indicated.


Although boron is potentially toxic to all organisms and, as boric acid and borax, has been used as a pesticide and food preservative, higher animals usually do not accumulate boron because of their ability to rapidly excrete it.17 Authenticated cases of poisoning in humans have been few and have primarily been the result of accidental ingestion of insecticides and household products containing borates or use of large amounts of boric acid in the treatment of burns.81 Improper use of boric acid–containing antiseptics is still one of the most common causes of toxic accidents in newborns and infants. Because boric acid is readily absorbed through damaged skin, it should not be applied topically to extensive wounds.21 In animals, long-term low-level boron exposure has been shown to cause reduced growth, cutaneous disorders, and suppression of male reproductive system function.82 Studies indicated that male rodents developed testicular atrophy with dietary exposure to boric acid above 4500 ppm and had decreased sperm motility at all exposure levels above 1000 ppm.83 Humans given 100 mg of boron intravenously or 270 mg of boric acid orally reported no discomfort and showed no obvious signs of toxicity.84,85 Drinking water with high boron concentrations in Turkey has not been shown to cause untoward effects in humans exposed over multiple generations.86 Airborne exposures to boron oxide and its hydration product, boric acid, have been reported to cause respiratory and eye irritation.87 A fatal outcome was reported after ingestion of g of boric acid by a child; however, adults have survived acute intakes of nearly 300 g.88 The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level for boron of 20 mg/day for adults over 18 years of age and as low as 3 mg for chil- dren between 1 and 3 years of age.89 One author suggested that plasma or serum concentrations greater than 300 ng/mL indicate an intake in excess of what is needed to prevent deficiency, whereas levels more than 1 mcg/mL indicate toxicity.50 Boron may also have the potential for toxicity during pregnancy. A study in a population of newborns exposed to normal environmental boron levels through pregnancy found a negative relationship between whole blood δ -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity and placental boron levels. This is certainly concerning given the neurotoxic effects caused by lead’s inhibition of this same enzyme.90 Common signs and symptoms of acute boron toxicity (largely based on animal data) include nausea, as well as vomiting and diarrhea that are blue–green in color.8,88 Other symptoms seen with acute exposure are abdominal pain, an erythematous rash involving both the skin and mucous membranes, stimulation or depression of the central nervous system, convulsions, hyperpyrexia, renal tubular damage, abnormal

liver function, and jaundice.21 Increased urinary riboflavin excretion has also been reported subsequent to acute boric acid ingestion.91 Symptoms of long-term intoxication include anorexia, gastrointesti- nal disturbances, debility, confusion, dermatitis, menstrual disorders, anemia, convulsions, and alopecia.21 In three cases of work-related exposure, alopecia signs were reversed when boric acid exposure was reduced or eliminated.92 Because it is excreted primarily in urine, cau- tion should be used for those with impaired renal function. Because of its ability to increase the excretion of boron, in cases of toxicity, N-acetylcysteine is the preferred intervention.93


Boron supplementation may increase serum magnesium, testosterone, and estrogen levels. However, no adverse clinical effects have been reported.


Although the skeletal response to boron is modified by other nutri- tional variables, such as calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, methionine, essential fatty acid intake, and arginine, considerable evidence indi- cates that both the compositional and functional properties of bone are affected by boron status at least somewhat independently of other variables. Findings suggest that boron is an important nutrient not only for mineral metabolism but also for varied aspects of optimal health in humans, including influences on lipid membrane integrity and cellular signaling pathways. Although all published trials are not in agreement on the effect of boron supplementation on levels of β -estradiol and testosterone, evidence strongly suggests that boron deficiency results in decreased levels in postmenopausal women, whereas supplementation tends to normalize levels in these same women. Boron’s effect on sex hormones in other segments of the population is still equivocal, although recent evidence suggests it may increase free testosterone levels at least in men. Topically it has shown clinical benefit for treating some forms of vaginitis (see Chapter 224, Vaginitis, Vulvovaginitis and Vulvodynia). As the mechanisms for its action are more thoroughly understood, which now include influencing S-adenosylmethionine metabolism and reg- ulation of osteogenesis and cellular signaling pathways, therapy with boron may become more targeted and specific. On the basis of available information, boron appears to offer ben- efits in the prevention of osteoporosis and arthritis, as well as cancer prevention. It is also a safe and potentially effective mineral to consider in any treatment regimen for both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, as well as several cancers.

## 459CHAPTER 59 Bromelain

South America were already using bromelain-rich pineapple juice to cure bellyaches and improve digestion. As a proteolytic enzyme, bro- melain aids in the digestion of protein foods. Because of bromelain’s wide pH activity, it is effective on substrates in the acidic stomach as well as the alkaline small intestine. To aid in digestion, bromelain supplements should be taken with, or just before, a meal. Enzyme supplements are also effective against numerous diseases and condi- tions when taken between meals in a method referred to as systemic enzyme therapy.

Bromelain—when taken systemically—can help slow many of the degenerative effects of aging4,51; inhibit cancer growth and metastasis5–10; prevent the aggregation of blood platelets5,12–18 and thereby help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other car- diovascular conditions; improve digestive problems51–53; treat dysmenorrhea19,54; improve the symptoms of immune condi- tions38; fight infections22–24,26,55; effectively speed up healing from inflammatory diseases and conditions26–39; fight sinusitis and other respiratory tract diseases44,45; and improve antibiotic absorption.54–56 To be effective systemically, many enzymes are enterically coated to prevent them from breaking down in the acidic stom- ach. Enzymes with wide pH, such as bromelain, can also be taken between meals. In this way, they are able to move through the digestive system and into the small intestine, pass through the brush border into the circulatory system, and be used by organs and cells in the body. To be most effective, systemically, it is essential to take enzymes on an empty stomach, approximately 1.5 hours before or after a meal (when used for digestive ther- apy, enzymes should be ingested approximately 30 minutes before meals). See the “Dosage” section of this chapter. In the past, it was widely assumed that large protein mole- cules—such as enzymes—could not survive the digestive process and be reabsorbed intact. However, numerous studies have demon- strated that bromelain—and other proteolytic enzymes—can be absorbed by the small intestine through a number of routes, pass into the bloodstream, and ultimately circulate throughout the body.57–59 Oral administration is effective, as is parenteral administration.26,59–61 Research on dogs indicated that levels of bromelain (after oral administration) peaked at 10 hours and were still detectable after hours, whereas intravenous infusion peaked in 50 minutes and was detectable for 5 hours.60 A randomized, controlled, double-blind study on humans demon- strated that the highest plasma concentration of bromelain was achieved at approximately 48 hours.57,58 A study of 19 men given grams of oral bromelain daily indicated that the enzyme had a plasma half-life of 6 to 9 hours. Researchers estimated that within the 3- to 50-hour period, an average of 10.8 mcg of bromelain was present in plasma.57 In both animals and humans, studies indicated that up to 40% of the absorbed orally administered bromelain was absorbed intact.59–61 For an in-depth discussion of enzyme absorption, please refer to Chapter 100 on pancreatic enzymes.


When used in systemic enzyme therapy, bromelain exerts a wide vari- ety of therapeutic effects26,50,51: • Fights many of the disorders associated with aging (e.g., digestive problems,51 osteoarthritis,4 and cancer5–10) • Assists digestion51–53 • Prevents and treats cancer5–10,62 • Inhibits blood platelet aggregation5,12–18 • Reduces pain17,63–65 • Relaxes smooth muscles12 • Stimulates the immune system20,21 • Fights inflammation26–33 • Reduces swelling28,63,64 • Improves wound healing29 • Relieves sinusitis44,45 • Debrides burns and wounds66–68 • Improves antibiotic absorption54–56

## Aging

Unfortunately, the process of aging is accompanied by an increasingly wide variety of health problems, including chronic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and arthritis. Further, the num- ber of Americans over 65 is increasing every year. According to the US Census Bureau, over 20% of the American population will be age 65 or older by the year 2050. That figure was only 12% in 2008.69 Most commonly, the body loses resiliency as it ages and various degenerative diseases manifest. This is accompanied by a decline in hormone secretion,70,71 immune system function,71,72 and enzyme production,73,74 thus reducing the body’s effectiveness at fighting off foreign invaders. The symptoms of aging could be, at least partially, the consequence of these enzymatic reductions. For example, the graying of hair has been attributed to a lack of tyrosinase or a loss of its activity level. Unlike the known serious side effects of most prescription drugs, bromelain has been shown to effectively fight many of the disorders associated with aging, including digestive problems,49 osteoarthritis,4 and cancer,5–10 but without the serious and long-term side effects of many drugs. Bromelain is also widely incorporated into lotions, creams, scrubs, facial masks, and other skin care products, where it is believed to improve the skin’s appearance by removing dead skin cells.


The standard of care for treating cancer has long included surgery, che- motherapy, and radiation, although hormone therapy, stem cell trans- plantation, and biological therapy (which includes immunotherapy) are increasingly being used. Treatment with bromelain is one form of biological therapy showing considerable promise in the treatment of cancer by preventing its growth,5 delaying or preventing its metasta- sis,6–9 and in some cases, exhibiting a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells.9,10 In addition, in vitro studies show that bromelain can enhance the ther- apeutic value of several chemotherapeutics8,62,75 and can alleviate some of the side effects of hormone therapy in patients with breast cancer.76 Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States.77 To determine whether bromelain could prevent skin cancer, researchers gave hairless mice 20 mg of bromelain per kilogram of body weight per day for 1 year and then subjected them to ultraviolet light for 15 minutes three times per week for the same period11 (it is generally agreed that exposure to ultraviolet rays increases an individu- al’s risk of skin cancer). After 1 year, only 40% of the bromelain group developed skin cancer (as opposed to 100% of the control group). In addition, it took the bromelain group twice as long to develop lesions. Another study, conducted over a 6-month period, found that mice receiving 80 mg of bromelain per kilogram of body weight did not develop any abrasions after 2 months.5 Bromelain also appears effective at reducing cancer metastasis. An in vitro study on bromelain and glioma (primary brain tumor) cells

## 460SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

found that bromelain significantly and reversibly reduced the migra- tion, adhesion, and invasion of glioma cells.6 In this study, bromelain did not appear to have a cytotoxic effect, even after a 3-month treat- ment period. An in vitro study on four different gastrointestinal cancer cell lines found that treatment with bromelain significantly inhibited their spread.7 Another study determined that a combination of bromelain and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was significantly more effective at inhib- iting the growth and spread of cancer cells than either bromelain or NAC alone.8 A study on human cholangiocarcinoma (CC) cell lines found that bromelain treatment reduced cancer cell viability and inhibited the ability of those cells to migrate and invade.9 Treatment with brome- lain also induced apoptosis, an important function of most, if not all, cancer therapies.78 Particularly encouraging are animal studies suggesting antimeta- static properties and inhibition of platelet aggregation associated with metastasis, as well as inhibition of invasiveness and growth of tumor cells. For example, an in vivo study on mice found that bromelain sig- nificantly increased the animals’ survival time in five of the six tumor lines evaluated.79 Researchers transplanted the tumor cell lines (leuke- mia P-388, sarcoma S-37, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells [EAT], Lewis lung carcinoma cells [LLC], M-B16F10 [MB-F10] melanoma, and ADC- 755 mammary adenocarcinoma cells) into the mice and 24 hours later administered bromelain either intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously (depending on tumor type). The life expectancy of the mice treated with bromelain increased compared with the untreated mice or those treated with the control (5-fluorouracil) in all cases except those transplanted with MB-F10 melanoma (the researchers considered bromelain’s effect on this tumor cell line to be a nonsignif- icant increase in survival). Pharmacological and preclinical studies indicate that bromelain acts as an immunomodulator by inducing the production of distinct cytokines (such as interleukin[IL]-1 β , IL-6, and IL-8, as well as tumor necrosis factor- γ ), and by raising the impaired immunocytotoxicity of monocytes against tumor cells.10,26,80–83 These findings were par- tially confirmed in a study involving 16 mammary tumor patients.80 In that study, bromelain had a significant effect on monocytes, natu- ral killer cells, and lymphocytes. In those patients who responded to bromelain treatment, monocyte cytotoxicity increased from 7.8% to 54% in b-macrophage-activated killer cells (bMAK-cells) and 16% to 47% in macrophage-activated killer cells (MAK-cells). Another study on breast cancer cell line MCF-7 found that treatment with bromelain significantly decreased the viability of the MCF-7 cells.84 The research- ers found that bromelain’s strength was similar to that of taxol. Bromelain appears to work synergistically with chemotherapeutics and improves their therapeutic efficacy.62,75 Researchers conducted an in vitro study on gastrointestinal cancer and found that bromelain in combination with N-acetylcysteine potentiated the effect of numerous chemotherapeutics.75 An in vitro study on breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 found that bromelain in combination with cisplatin induced apoptosis to a higher degree than either bromelain or cisplatin when used as a sin- gle agent.62 Most encouraging was the determination that the addition of bromelain significantly enhanced the activity of cisplatin, allowing for a reduction in the necessary dose of cisplatin, thereby potentially reducing its sometimes-serious side effects. In addition to its effect on cancer cell growth and metastasis, bro- melain may relieve some of the adverse side effects of hormone ther- apy in the treatment of breast cancer.76,85 Bromelain in combination with papain, sodium selenite, and Lens culinaris lectin was given to women receiving hormone therapy as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.77 After 4 weeks of therapy, those suffering from adverse effects of the hormone therapy (which often include arthralgia and muco- sal dryness) experienced a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for bromelain’s effect on cancer. Some researchers believe that bromelain’s proteolytic activ- ity may be responsible for its effect on tumor cells,6,84 whereas others believe its effectiveness may be due to its other components.10,26,80

## Circulatory Disorders

Research shows that bromelain is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggre- gation, both in vivo and in vitro.5,12–18 Platelet aggregation is a major factor in atherogenesis and can result in heart attack, stroke, acute thrombophlebitis, transient ischemic attack, nightly leg cramps, edema, deep venous thrombosis, ecchymosis, and cellulitis. Bromelain’s action could be due to its plasmin-increasing effects (plasmin is a proteolytic enzyme produced by the body whose job is to dissolve fibrin, a protein involved in blood clot formation).86 Further, research demonstrates that bromelain (in conjunction with potassium and magnesium) can be effective in treating angina pectoris.18,87 An ex vivo study on rats found that bromelain offers cardiopro- tective activity.88 The rats received an intraperitoneal injection of bro- melain twice daily for 15 days before their hearts were removed and ischemia was induced in the heart. Researchers concluded that the bro- melain treatment reduced the size of the infarct, limited injury to the myocardium, and thereby, enhanced cardiac function. Researchers employed bromelain as an adjunct to analgesics in a double-blind study involving 73 patients with acute thrombophlebi- tis.17 All symptoms of inflammation, including pain, swelling, tender- ness, redness, disability, and elevated skin temperature, decreased. The common daily dose of bromelain (in this study and others) was 60 to 160 mg of 1200 MCU bromelain. Other researchers believe that doses of 400 to 800 mg are necessary in treating patients with thrombophle- bitis (and many other conditions as well).18

## Digestive Disorders

As mentioned previously, when taken with or just before meals, bro- melain supplements can regulate digestion. As a proteolytic enzyme, bromelain improves the digestion of protein-containing food. When taken systemically, bromelain is effective in treating pancreatic insuffi- ciency (and is a proven substitute for trypsin or pepsin in cases of pan- creatic insufficiency and postpancreatectomy).51 Researchers in one study found that nearly 22% of subjects over the age of 60 years had pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.74 Double-blind studies determined that bromelain is particularly effective at treating pancreatic insuffi- ciency when combined with ox bile and pancreatin.52,53

## Dysmenorrhea

Bromelain in combination with papain is an effective treatment for dysmenorrhea.19 Bromelain decreases the spasms of a contracted cer- vix in tested patients, so it is believed to be a smooth muscle relaxant. As-yet-unidentified substances in bromelain may be more beneficial in this regard than the bromelain protease; when isolated and puri- fied, the protease failed to produce a similar effect. Bromelain increases levels of prostaglandin-E (PGE 1 )-like compounds while decreasing prostaglandins of the 2-series (e.g., PGE 2 and PGF 2a ), which is hypoth- esized to be the basis for bromelain’s muscle-relaxing ability.50 Endometriosis is a frequent cause of dysmenorrhea and occurs when endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus. Researchers conducted in vitro and in vivo tests to assess the effect of a combina- tion of N-acetyl cysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, and bromelain on endo- metriosis.54 The study results showed that the combination not only

resulted in the developed of fewer and smaller cysts but also had an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the activation of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1).

## Immune Disorders

Bromelain appears to have immunomodulatory effects on immune and autoimmune disorders.20,21 Understanding and treating immune disorders is becoming increasingly important because these disorders include many chronic conditions. (Please see the “Respiratory Tract Diseases” section of this chapter for a discussion of bromelain and respiratory conditions, including asthma.) Two of the most devastating immune disorders are immune complex hypersensitivities (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and glomeru- lonephritis) and autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythe- matosus). Immune complex hypersensitivities occur when antigens and antibodies bind, forming a cluster that can lodge in tissues or circulate throughout the body, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Circulating immune complexes seem to be a major compo- nent of numerous immune disorders. Various factors inhibit cellular immunity, but the most important elements seem to be these “block- ing factors” (i.e., immune complexes) that cause immune suppres- sion. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells. There are dozens of such conditions, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gra- vis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are two types of autoimmune disease, collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Researchers conducted an in vitro study to measure the effect of bromelain on the secretion of proinflam- matory cytokines in IBD.38 They determined that bromelain treatment significantly decreased the secretion of cytokines (including granulo- cyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], interferon gamma [IFN- γ ], and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) and chemokines (including macro- phage inflammatory protein-1ß [MIP-1ß]). According to the research- ers, the secretion of these proinflammatory substances was due to bromelain’s proteolytic activity. Systemic enzyme therapy can stimulate the body’s own defenses, accelerate the inflammatory process, and break down pathogenic immune complexes from the tissues, bringing them into the blood- stream for elimination. It is important to note that because enzyme use liberates immune complexes from the tissues, increasing their presence in the bloodstream, symptoms may actually increase in severity; how- ever, this is only temporary. When used in sufficient quantities, the enzymes can then degrade the immune complexes in the bloodstream (sometimes within a few hours), and the disease symptoms should subside.

## Infections

Infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can fre- quently be the most challenging conditions to treat. Bromelain has proven effective in fighting numerous infections, ranging from Escherichia coli to bronchitis (see the “Respiratory Tract Diseases” sec- tion later in this chapter). The O157:H7 strain of E. coli is a particularly severe and potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that causes nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea in humans and can lead to kidney failure and death. The E. coli enterotoxins gain a foothold by adhering to receptors on the intestinal mucosa. Preventing the attachment could also prevent the resulting diarrhea. Researchers administered a single dose of enter- ically coated protease granules (containing bromelain) to rabbits and then inoculated the animals with different strains of E. coli.22 Of those rabbits given the enzyme mixture and strain H10407, only one ani- mal died, and none of the remaining rabbits developed diarrhea. In the group not inoculated with the enzyme mixture, 87% either developed severe diarrhea or died.22 Comparable results were obtained with other bacterial infections. For example, similar studies with bromelain have been conducted on piglets inoculated with K88 positive E. coli,24 and an in vitro study on rabbit ileum found that bromelain was also 51% effective against chol- era toxin.23 Antibiotics are often the drug of choice to treat bacterial infections. Some studies indicate that bromelain may be as effective as antibiotics in treating numerous infectious processes, including bronchitis, per- irectal abscess, pyelonephritis, and cutaneous staphylococcus infec- tion.26,55 In addition if, and when, treatment with antibiotics becomes necessary, studies show that bromelain can increase serum levels of several antibiotics (including tetracycline, amoxicillin, and penicillin) in different body fluids (including blood, cerebral spinal fluid, mucus, sputum, and urine) and tissues (including appendix, gallbladder, ovary, epithelium, and uterus).54–56 Bromelain also shows effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus.89 S. aureus is a gram-positive bacterium responsible for a number of infections, including skin infections (staph infections). Drug-resistant strains of S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and van- comycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), have rendered the infection par- ticularly difficult to treat. Researchers evaluated the effect of bromelain and other enzymes on drug-resistant S. aureus biofilms and found that, after a 2-hour treatment with bromelain, the S. aureus biomass had been reduced by up to 98%.89 The researchers concluded that treat- ment with enzymes may be a beneficial therapy against infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria. Tuberculosis (TB) is another bacterial infection that appears to respond to bromelain treatment.25 In an in vitro study, researchers evaluated stem bromelain’s effect on murine and human macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for TB.25 Study results show that bromelain treatment reduced the production of foamy macrophages and inhibited the bacteria’s via- bility. Foamy macrophages are produced as part of the inflammatory response and may play an important role in the progression of TB.90 Bromelain may also play a role in preventing periodontal disease.91 An in vitro study found that a bromelain solution restricted the growth of several pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus fecalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, implicated in the formation of periodontal disease.91 The researchers hypothesized that bromelain may have prevented the pathogens from adhering to periodontal tissues.

## Inflammatory Diseases and Conditions

The ability of bromelain to decrease inflammation has been docu- mented in various clinical studies and experimental models.26–39 This anti-inflammatory action is beneficial because the inflammatory pro- cess is involved in numerous conditions, including injuries, infec- tions, respiratory tract diseases, and arthritis (many of these conditions are covered separately within this chapter). In addition, numerous studies have noted bromelain’s ability to reduce pain, swelling, and bruising and improve the rate of healing after various surgical pro- cedures.26–30,92 Unlike the majority of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), there seems to be no indication that bromelain pro- motes bleeding; however, because bromelain inhibits platelet aggrega- tion, it is logical to assume that it might increase the risk of bleeding, so care should be exercised (see the section on drug interactions in this chapter). Some of the earliest studies on bromelain involved athletic injuries. A 1960 study of boxers highlighted bromelain’s rehabilitative effects.29

<!-- chunk -->

## 462SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Within 4 days of initiating bromelain treatment, 58 of 74 boxers expe- rienced complete resolution of all signs of bruising. Complete clear- ance of bruising occurred in 8 to 10 days in the remaining 16 boxers receiving bromelain. At the end of 4 days, only 10 boxers in the control group demonstrated complete clearance of bruising, whereas clearance in the remaining 62 in the control group required 7 to 14 days. It is important to note that bromelain’s effect on pain reduction is probably not due to any direct analgesic effect but rather to its ability to reduce tissue edema and inflammation. Fifty-nine patients with muscle strains, contusions, ligament tears, and other injuries to the musculoskeletal system received 500 mg of bromelain three times daily, 30 minutes before meals.31 Results from this study and others indicate that the use of bromelain led to a rapid improvement of pain at rest and during motion, swelling, inflamma- tion, and tenderness on palpation.63,64 Seventy-seven otherwise healthy subjects completed a study inves- tigating bromelain’s effect on mild acute knee pain of less than months’ duration.32 Two validated questionnaires (the Psychological Well-Being Index and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities [WOMAC] Knee Health Index) were completed as a baseline and after 1 month of bromelain treatment (200 or 400 mg/day, allocated ran- domly to volunteers). In both bromelain groups, all WOMAC symp- tom scores decreased significantly compared with baseline. Reductions in the total symptom score were 41% for the low-dose group of bro- melain recipients and 59% in the high-dose group. Additionally, those receiving 400 mg/day of bromelain experienced significantly greater improvement in total symptom score plus stiffness and physical func- tion dimensions compared with those receiving low-dose (200 mg/ day) bromelain. Both bromelain groups experienced a significant improvement in overall psychological well-being compared with base- line (researchers noted a dose-dependent relationship). Researchers in a study on knee osteoarthritis found that 500 mg per day of bromelain (2000 GDU) taken for 4 weeks was as effective as diclofenac (a commonly prescribed NSAID) in reducing WOMAC scores.4 The diclofenac arm of the study was terminated at week because of ethical reasons relative to side effects, whereas the group receiving bromelain continued the study for 16 weeks. The researchers deemed bromelain treatment to be safe.

## Surgery

Numerous studies indicate bromelain’s effectiveness at reducing post- surgical inflammation.28,30,93,94 A double-blind study of patients who underwent oral surgery found that bromelain was significantly supe- rior to placebo in reducing swelling (3.8 days compared with 7 days for the placebo).28 In addition, the duration of pain decreased to 5.1 days in the bromelain group compared with 8.1 days for the placebo group.27,28 The researchers concluded that although postsurgical med- ication alone was effective, a regimen of presurgical and postsurgical bromelain was recommended to enhance the healing process. Bromelain is also effective at relieving the pain and edema that typ- ically follow wisdom tooth extraction.65,94 Researchers in a study of patients found that 70% experienced reduced swelling and pain after taking bromelain.65 Researchers in another study of 46 patients found that bromelain was as effective as ketoprofen (an NSAID).94 Similar observations were made in studies of episiotomy cases. Several studies show that bromelain reduced pain and edema after epi- siotomy.30,92,93 In addition, preoperative administration of bromelain improved the potential positive effects.30,93

## Anti-inflammatory Action of Bromelain

Bromelain may function as an anti-inflammatory by (1) activating proteolytic activity at the inflammation site, (2) lysing fibrin at the site (fibrin is a protein required for blood clotting), (3) depleting kininogen (a kinin precursor; kinin causes blood vessels to dilate), and (4) inhibiting the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and the induc- tion of prostaglandin E 1 accumulation (which, thereby, inhibits vasodilation).33,48,81 Bromelain’s proteolytic activity demonstrates a delayed analge- sic effect that involves the action of two mechanisms: (1) bromelain cleaves inflammatory mediators, including the kinins and prostaglan- dins, which directly stimulate the pain receptors; and (2) bromelain supports the breakdown of plasmin protein and immune complexes that stem from the tissues by cleaving them directly and by stimulating their phagocytosis. The reduction of edema that subsequently follows leads to a relief of pressure and, secondarily, a reduction in pain, thus inhibiting bradykinin formation (a chemical mediator of inflamma- tion) at the inflammation site. Of these processes, the primary pharmacological effects of bro- melain are most likely plasmin activation and the decrease in kinin levels. As mentioned in the “Cancer” section, bromelain functions as an immunomodulator and effectively increases the levels of some cytokines while reducing the levels of others, thus leading to cytokine homeostasis and a reduction in inflammation. Bromelain also exhibits anti-inflammatory activity when applied topically. Products are available containing bromelain (typically in combination with chondroitin and glucosamine) for the treatment of arthritis and joint/muscle pain. Other combinations containing bro- melain are marketed for the relief of dry skin and eczema, back pain, and other inflammatory conditions.

## Respiratory Tract Conditions

Respiratory tract conditions, including asthma, bronchitis, and sinus- itis, are marked by increased mucus production, inflammation, and resulting pain. Bromelain has shown effectiveness against each of these symptoms.42–44 A double-blind study on patients with acute sinusitis found that 87% of those receiving bromelain experienced good to excellent results in symptom relief compared with 68% of the placebo group.44 Most notable was the reduction of mucosal inflammation (83%–52%) and difficulty breathing (78%–68%) in the bromelain group compared with the placebo group. An epidemiological cohort study on children with acute sinusitis compared the symptom recovery time of those treated with bromelain, standard therapy (which included antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, and analgesics), or bromelain in combination with standard therapy.45 The results of the study indicate that treatment with bromelain led to a statistically significant faster recovery time than with standard treatment or bromelain combined with standard treatment. When given by intraperitoneal injection, bromelain has been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects in allergic airway disease in numer- ous studies involving murine models,95–97 but it is also effective when given orally. Researchers hypothesize that bromelain may be beneficial in treating human asthma, as well. In addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, bromelain may be effective in the treatment of respiratory tract conditions because of its mucolytic activity.43 Bromelain appears to reduce sputum vis- cosity and possesses an antitussive effect in patients with chronic bronchitis. Spirometric examination of patients before and after bromelain treatment indicated increased FEV 1 (a measurement of the amount of air exhaled in a forced exhalation) and vital capacity, whereas residual volume was reduced. These favorable results were believed to be due to bromelain’s ability to function as a mucolytic and decrease bronchial secretions, thereby reducing respiratory congestion.

## Cosmetic and Dermatological Applications

Although bromelain supplements are effective against numerous con- ditions, bromelain’s applications are not limited to its oral use. A num- ber of topical bromelain preparations, including skin care products, dentifrices, and skin debridement formulations are available over the counter and also by prescription. As a proteolytic enzyme, bromelain degrades proteins, including the dead cells in the stratum corneum—the outer layer of the epider- mis. This ability is particularly beneficial in skin care products, includ- ing cosmetics, exfoliants, and shaving lotions. Bromelain is also used in dentifrices for its tooth-whitening proper- ties. Researchers in a study on bovine teeth found that treatment with a gel containing papain and bromelain effectively removed the stains that resulted after the teeth had soaked for 1 week in a coffee solution.98 The researchers noted that unlike peroxide-based gels, which are com- monly used in clinical dental bleaching products, the enzyme mixture does not produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can deleteri- ously affect the teeth and surrounding soft tissues.99 In another study, researchers subjected the enamel portions of human teeth to a mixture of human saliva, tea, instant coffee, areca nut, betel leaf, lime, tobacco leaf, smokeless tobacco, and chlorhex- idine.100 After 24 hours, the tooth portions were treated with either a control toothpaste (Colgate Regular) or with the test toothpaste (a commercial product containing papain, bromelain, miswak [Salvadora persica], neem [Azadirachta indica], and fluoride). Compared with the control product, the lightness value of the teeth treated with the bromelain-containing toothpaste had improved to a statistically sig- nificant level. According to the researchers, the enzymes’ proteolytic activity removed the protein component of the plaque on the teeth to which the stains are known to bind. Bromelain products are also effective in debriding dead and dam- aged tissue resulting from severe burns.66–68 It is important to remove necrotic tissue because it can interfere with healing and potentially con- taminate the wound. Debriding the damaged tissue exposes healthy tis- sue, promotes healing, and provides a clear foundation for skin grafting, when necessary. One such enzyme formulation is a bromelain-based gel dressing. Several studies confirm its safety and efficacy in burn debridement.66–68 Unlike surgery and chemical or biological methods, enzymatic debridement rapidly removes necrotic tissue without damaging under- lying and adjacent healthy tissue.66,68 Skin debridement with brome- lain products is typically conducted in a burn center or other clinical setting. A Brazilian study found that emulsion-based bromelain products remained more stable than gels and that heat and light had adverse effects on shelf life.101


When used as a digestive aid, bromelain should be taken just before a meal (no more than 30 minutes before eating). When used systemi- cally, bromelain should be taken between meals, on an empty stomach (about 1.5 hours before or after a meal). Because supplement potency varies by manufacturer, it is best to follow the recommendations on the label for dosage. Most bromelain currently marketed in the United States is between 600 and 2400 GDUs. Bromelain is a hydrolytic enzyme, so supplements should be taken with plenty of water to place the enzyme into solution. As with all enzymes, bromelain’s activity can be inhibited by cold or increased by heat; however, excessive heat will denature the enzyme, so avoid drink- ing hot liquids when taking bromelain supplements.

# SIDE EFFECTS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS

High doses (nearly 2 g) of bromelain have been administered with no apparent side effects.104 No lethal dose 50 (LD 50 ) exists up to 10 g/kg, so it is deemed to be virtually nontoxic.103 Long-term use seems to be well tolerated. As with most therapeutic agents, allergic reactions may occur with prolonged occupational exposure or in sensitive individu- als; however, no significant side effects have been noted.103,106 No teratogenic studies have been conducted in humans, so bro- melain should not be used by pregnant women. In addition, studies have not been conducted on the safety of using bromelain in nursing mothers. Although no anaphylactic reactions have been reported, bro- melain can induce gastrointestinal allergic and immunoglobulin- E–mediated respiratory reactions, as well as cross-react with papain, rye flour, wheat flour, birch pollen, and grass pollen.103,106 Although side effects are infrequently observed, bromelain sensitivity as manifested by skin rash or urticaria has occurred. Other possible but unconfirmed reactions include vomiting, nausea, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, and diarrhea. Researchers hypothesize that bromelain’s ability to inhibit platelet aggregation may increase the risk of bleeding40; however, there are no studies to support this assertion. Eckert et al. administered FIP units daily to patients with breast cancer, with no significant alter- ations in their prothrombin time or plasminogen.80


There are few known interactions between bromelain and other med- ications. However, because bromelain is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation (both in vivo and in vitro),5,12–18 caution should be exer- cised when used with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) as well as over- the-counter NSAIDs, including aspirin and ibuprofen. In addition, certain botanicals, including garlic, ginkgo biloba, and ginseng, may increase bleeding risk, so patients should be monitored when these are used in conjunction with bromelain. Clinical studies show that bromelain can increase serum levels of sev- eral antibiotics (including tetracycline, amoxicillin, and penicillin) in body fluids and tissues.54–56 This can be helpful when attempting to improve an antibiotic’s efficacy; however, it is possible that there could be instances where elevated serum levels of antibiotics would be deleterious. Any foods that contain protease inhibitors have the potential to decrease the proteolytic activity of bromelain. However, most of these foods (e.g., potatoes and soybeans) are rarely eaten raw (heat inacti- vates the protease inhibitors). In addition, many of the protease inhib- itors found in these (and other) foods are actually trypsin inhibitors (bromelain contains no trypsin).

# CONCLUSION

The future of oral enzyme therapy is already here; however, the rate at which this knowledge is used in restoring health to millions is deplorably slow. This concerns those scientists, doctors, biochemists, and pharma- cists who recognize the potential of enzyme therapy. This chapter on bromelain and Chapter 100 on pancreatic enzymes have been written in the hope of hastening the day when enzyme therapy will be employed as a matter of course for every disorder in which it can be of assistance.

## 466SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

In addition to exerting antioxidant activity on its own, green tea may increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes. In mice, oral feeding of a polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea in drinking water for 30 days resulted in significantly increased activities of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reduc- tase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, and quinone reductase) in the small intestine, liver, lungs, and small bowel.7 Several in vitro and experimental models of cancer have shown that green tea polyphenols may offer significant protection.8,9 Specifically, green tea polyphenols inhibit cancer via inhibition of metalloprotein- ases, various protein kinases, proteins that regulate DNA replication and transformation, tumor proteasomal activity, and the formation of cancer-causing compounds such as nitrosamines. Green tea polyphe- nols also upregulate or maintain intercellular–gap junction communi- cation and increase apoptosis. Green tea acts as a carcinoma blocker by modulating the signal transduction pathways involved in cell prolifera- tion, transformation, inflammation, and metastasis. The consumption of flavonoid-containing botanicals, like green tea, has demonstrated clear antioxidant benefit, and a diet high in polyphenols has demon- strated effectiveness at lowering 8-OHdG levels.10

## -Theanine

l-theanine (N-ethyl-l-glutamine) or theanine is a major amino acid uniquely found in green tea. In animal models, l-theanine increases brain serotonin, dopamine, and γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels and has micromolar affinities for various brain receptor sites, including α -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA), kain- ate, and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA). Theanine has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models, possibly through its antagonistic effects on group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. Behavioral studies in animals suggest improvement in learning and memory. Clinical studies demonstrated that l-theanine reduces stress, improves the quality of sleep, diminishes the symptoms of premen- strual syndrome, heightens mental acuity, and reduces the negative side effects of caffeine.11,12 These clinical effects are directly related to l-theanine’s ability to stimulate the production of α -brain waves (a state often achieved by meditation and characterized by relaxation with greater mental focus and mental alertness) as well as reduce β -waves (associated with nervousness, scattered thoughts, and hyperactivity). l-theanine is a popular ingredient in functional foods and bev- erages as well as dietary supplements designed to produce mental and physical relaxation without inducing drowsiness. l-theanine is fast-acting. Generally, the effects are felt within the first 30 minutes and have been shown to last up to 8 to 12 hours. Based on the results of clinical studies, it has been established that l-theanine is effective in the range of 50 to 200 mg.

# CLINICAL APPLICATION

The primary clinical applications for green tea are in the prevention of cancer and heart disease, as well as aiding weight loss. It may also offer benefit to bone health and may protect the skin from sun damage.


Epidemiological studies demonstrate that green tea consumption might offer significant protection against many forms of cancer. However, epidemiological correlations regarding the relationship between tea consumption and human cancer are confounded by numerous variables. The forms of cancer that appear to be best pre- vented by green tea are those of the gastrointestinal tract, including cancers of the stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and colon. Green tea may also provide protection against lung and estrogen-related cancers, including most breast cancers, skin cancer, and prostate cancer.13–18 It is generally held that a desirable green tea intake is 3 to 5 cups/day, pro- viding a minimum of 250 mg/day catechins. However, based on clini- cal data, this dosage level may not be sufficient once neoplasia develops or in high-risk individuals. Although a population-based study of women in Shanghai found that among nonsmokers, the consumption of green tea was associated with a clearly reduced risk of lung cancer, in a dose-dependent man- ner, 17 studies showed little benefit in antioxidant effects in smokers even at significant dosage levels (i.e., more than 3 grams green tea poly- phenols per day).19 In preventing breast cancer, the main anticancer mechanism may be inhibition of the interaction of estrogen with its receptors in breast tissue. Polyphenol compounds in green tea extracts also block the interaction of tumor promoters, hormones, and growth factors with their receptors in breast tissue. Experimental and epidemiolog- ical studies demonstrated a protective effect against breast cancer,

and clinical results confirmed that green tea might be helpful for ear- ly-stage breast cancer. In an observational study, 1160 surgical cases of patients with invasive breast cancers were followed for 9 years. During a review of 5264 person-years follow-up, 133 subjects (12%) had a documented recurrence of breast cancer. A decreased hazard ratio for recurrence adjusted for stage was observed with the consumption of or more cups a day of green tea. Particularly in Stage I, the hazard ratio was decreased quite significantly. A similar tendency was observed for Stage II subjects but was not present among more advanced stages.20 The coadministration of tamoxifen with green tea catechins may be an appealing strategy, especially in the case of estrogen receptor (ER)– negative breast cancer, where green tea catechins have been reported to reactivate ER. Indeed, it has been observed that the treatment of ER-alpha-negative breast cancer cells with green tea polyphenols led to the reactivation of ER-alpha expression.21 Experimental trials sug- gest a synergistic interaction of green tea catechins with tamoxifen or raloxifene in the treatment of ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer through ER-dependent and ER-independent mechanisms. No evidence of an interaction of green tea catechins with aromatase inhib- itors or fulvestrant has been reported.22 Topical and oral treatments of green tea flavonoid components have also been explored to treat human papillomavirus (HPV)–related cervical cancer. A randomized, controlled clinical trial of 51 patients with cervical lesions, including chronic cervicitis, mild dysplasia, mod- erate dysplasia, and severe dysplasia, were divided into four treatment groups, whereas 39 untreated patients served as controls. Green tea components such as EGCG were shown to have antiproliferative prop- erties through the induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in cervi- cal cancer cell lines.23 A second trial used a polyphenol ointment made with EGCG applied locally to 27 patients twice a week for 12 weeks; 200 mg of the ointment or an EGCG capsule was taken orally every day for 8 to 12 weeks. Overall, a 69% response rate (35 of 51 patients) was noted for treatment with green tea extracts, with each treatment showing a similar response, compared with a 10% response rate (4 of 39 patients) in untreated controls. A response was considered positive when pre- treatment and posttreatment biopsies and Pap smears detected an elimination of abnormal cells, and there was a decrease in or complete elimination of HPV or a decrease in the size of the cervical lesion. The authors of this study concluded that green tea extracts might be a potential therapy regimen for patients with HPV-infected cervical lesions.24 In vitro and in vivo studies showed that EGCG produces marked inhibition of both hormone-sensitive and hormone-insensitive pros- tate cancer cells. To demonstrate concentration within the prostate of EGCG after oral intake, men with clinically localized prostate cancer consumed six cups of green tea daily or water for 3 to 6 weeks before undergoing radical prostatectomy.25 Using high-performance liquid chromatography, green tea polyphenols were not detected in prostate tissue or urine from men consuming water preoperatively. In contrast, both the methylated and nonmethylated forms of EGCG were detect- able in prostate tissue and urine in men consuming green tea. In an additional study of men undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, subjects were given 1300 mg of green tea polyphenols daily until surgery. Serum was collected before initiation of the drug study and on the day of prostatectomy. Serum biomarkers, including hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, insu- lin-like growth factor (IGF), IGF binding protein-3, and prostate-spe- cific antigen (PSA), were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed a significant reduction in serum lev- els of PSA, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor in men with prostate cancer after brief treatment with green tea.26 Even at this relatively high dosage of polyphenols, there was no elevation in liver enzymes. A proof-of-principle clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of green tea polyphenols for the chemoprevention of high- grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia developing prostate cancer within 1 year after repeated biopsy.27 Sixty volunteers with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia were given either a placebo or 600 mg of green tea polyphenol extract (GTPE) daily. After 1 year, only one tumor was diagnosed among the 30 GTPE-treated men (incidence, approximately 3%), whereas nine cancers were found among the placebo-treated men (incidence, approximately 30%). Total PSAs did not change significantly between the two arms, but GTPE-treated men showed values constantly lower with respect to placebo-treated ones. The International Prostate Symptom Scores and quality-of-life scores of GTPE-treated men with coexistent benign prostate hyperplasia improved, reaching statistical significance in the case of International Prostate Symptom Scores. As a secondary observation, administration of GTPE also reduced lower urinary tract symptoms, suggesting that these compounds might also be of help for treating the symptoms of benign prostate hyperplasia. No significant side effects or adverse effects were documented.

## Cancer Risk and Black Tea Consumption

In contrast to green tea, population studies analyzing black tea con- sumption are not as clear regarding cancer protection. Some early studies even indicated that black tea consumption might increase the risk for certain cancers (e.g., rectum, gallbladder, endometrium).28,29 For example, in one study, the relationship between black tea con- sumption and cancer risk was analyzed using data from an integrated series of case-control studies conducted in Northern Italy between 1983 and 1990.28 The data set included 119 biopsy-confirmed cancers of the oral cavity and throat, 294 of the esophagus, 564 of the stom- ach, 673 of the colon, 406 of the rectum, 258 of the liver, 41 of the gallbladder, 303 of the pancreas, 149 of the larynx, 2860 of the breast, 567 of the endometrium, 742 of the ovary, 107 of the prostate, 365 of the bladder, 147 of the kidney, 120 of the thyroid, and a total of controls admitted to the hospital for acute noncancerous conditions. After allowance for age, sex, area of residence, education, smoking, and coffee consumption, results indicated an increased risk with tea con- sumption for cancers of the rectum, gallbladder, and endometrium. There was no association with cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, bladder, kidney, prostate, or any other site considered. In another study, data on black tea consumption from 1965 to were clinically examined in 7833 men of Japanese ancestry.29 Since 1965, hundreds of newly diagnosed cancer cases have been identified: 152 colon, 151 lung, 149 prostate, 136 stomach, 76 rectum, 57 bladder, 30 pancreas, 25 liver, 12 kidney, and 163 at other (miscellaneous) sites. Compared with almost-never drinkers, men who habitually drank black tea more than once a day had a four-times-greater chance of developing rectal cancer.

## Cardiovascular and Liver Disease

Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have established a positive correlation between green tea consumption and cardiovas- cular health. Green tea polyphenols exert vascular protective effects through multiple mechanisms, including antioxidative, antihyperten- sive, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antithrombogenic, and lip- id-lowering effects.30 The underlying mechanisms for these effects are listed in Table 60.2. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 111 healthy adult vol- unteers were given either a green tea preparation (GTP) containing mg of l-theanine together with 200 mg of a decaffeinated catechin green tea extract twice a day or a placebo.31 Before and after 3 weeks, blood

pressure, serum lipids, serum amyloid- α (a marker of chronic inflam- mation), and serum malondialdehyde (a marker of oxidative stress) were measured. After 3 months, systolic blood pressure remained sig- nificantly lower. GTP lowered serum amyloid- α by 42% and lowered malondialdehyde by 11.9%. In men, there was a 9-mg/dL reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and a 10-mg/dL reduc- tion in total cholesterol (TC). In all subjects with a baseline LDL-c level greater than 99 mg/dL, there was a 9-mg/dL decrease of TC and LDL-c. A second double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 60 mildly hyper- cholesterolemic subjects (180–220 mg dL−1) and divided them into three groups: catechin-enriched green tea (CEGT), catechin-enriched oolong tea (CEOT), or placebo. The subjects were instructed to drink 2 × mL of CEGT (780.6 mg of catechin), CEOT (640.4 mg of catechin), or placebo beverage for 12 weeks. Drinking CEGT and CEOT signifi- cantly decreased subjects’ body weight, fat, body mass index (BMI), lipid peroxidation, and lipid profile (TC, LDL-c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], and triglycerides [TG]). CEGT and CEOT also sig- nificantly improved (p < 0.05) the oxidative indices (TEAC and GSH) and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR). Furthermore, ultrasound examination endorsed the hepatoprotective activity of CEGT and CEOT by reverting mild fatty liver to the normal hepatic condition because of antioxidant and hypolipidemic activities.32 Just as in the studies with cancer, cigarette smoking may nullify some of these protective effects against cardiovascular disease. A study from the Netherlands evaluating inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1 β , tumor necrosis factor- α , C-reactive protein, and fibrino- gen, found no benefit for 59 healthy smoking volunteers who drank tea with regard to inflammation, hemostasis, and the endothelial cardiovas- cular risk factors measured.33 Given other studies of green tea that showed little protection for smokers and the strong body of literature regarding its efficacy in nonsmoking populations, it is possible that the level of oxidative damage sustained by regular smoking may be too great for tea’s demon- strated antioxidant capacities. However, it may also be that the dosage of green tea polyphenols must be much higher in smokers. In one dou- ble-blind study, 30 healthy male smokers were divided into three groups and given green tea beverages containing 0 mg (control group), 80 mg (medium-dose group), or 580 mg (high-dose group) of green tea polyphe- nols daily for 2 weeks.34 Endothelial-dependent and endothelial-indepen- dent vasodilatation were investigated by measuring the forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside using venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography. The FBF response to acetylcho- line significantly increased at 2 hours and at 1 and 2 weeks after green tea polyphenol intake in the high-dose group, but no increase was observed in the other groups. FBF responses to sodium nitroprusside did not alter in any group at any time point. A significant increase in plasma nitric oxide and a decrease in asymmetrical dimethylarginine, malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and soluble CD40 ligand levels were detected after long-term consumption of high-dose green tea polyphenol. This study indicates that higher dosages might be required to overcome the oxidative stress of cigarette smoke.

decreased BMI (−0.55), body weight (−1.38 kg), and waist circumfer- ence (−1.93 cm) compared with caffeine alone. Studies that evaluated green tea catechins without concomitant caffeine administration did not show benefits on any of the assessed anthropometric end points.

## Bone Health

Epidemiological evidence demonstrates an association between green tea consumption and the prevention of age-related bone loss in elderly individuals. There are five proposed mechanisms through which green tea protects bone health: (1) by mitigating bone loss through antioxida- tive stress action, (2) by mitigating bone loss through anti-inflammatory action, (3) by enhancing osteoblastogenesis, (4) by suppressing osteoclas- togenesis, and (5) through its high content of fluoride and vitamin K 1 .37

## Neuroprotective Effects

EGCG has gained a lot of attention as a potential therapeutic agent for preventing neurodegenerative diseases, mostly attributed to the antioxidant, free-radical-scavenging, metal-chelating, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties.38 In support of this, a 13 year-long Finnish study with 30,000 adults aged 25 to 74 years reported a nearly 60% reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease when 3 or more cups of tea were consumed per day.39 In addition, a large-scale cohort 20-year fol- low-up analysis with approximately 50,000 men and 80,000 women showed that EGCG intake was associated with a 10% to 25% lower risk of Parkinson’s, particularly in men.40 Animal research on EGCG suggests there may be potential in pro- moting healthy aging by improving the morphological and functional alterations that occur in a natural aging brain, suppressing cognitive dysfunction, increasing learning ability, and reducing oxidative dam- age in the brain.41 Although EGCG shows promise as an iron-chelating, brain-permeable antioxidant agent, there is a need for examining this neuroprotective effect in depth through more human clinical trials.

# PHOTOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS

Topical treatment or oral consumption of green tea polyphenols inhibits chemical carcinogen or ultraviolet (UV) radiation–induced skin tumori- genesis in different animal models. In one study, volunteers were treated with an extract of green tea or one of its constituents and subsequently exposed to graded doses of UV radiation 30 minutes later.42 UV-treated skin was examined clinically for UV-induced erythema, looking his- tologically for the presence of sunburn cells or Langerhans cell distri- butions for UV-induced DNA damage. On histological examination, skin treated with green tea extracts had a reduced number of sunburn cells and protected epidermal Langerhans cells from UV damage. In a dose-dependent manner, EGCG and EGCG polyphenols proved to be the most efficient at inhibiting erythema. It was noted that the epigal- locatechin and epicatechin fractions showed almost no effect. Green tea extracts also reduced the DNA damage that formed after UV radiation.

# ORAL CAVITY DISEASES

Inflammatory gingival reactions, tooth decay, and oral cancer may also benefit from the use of green tea. By studying the amount of dental plaque present, as well as a bleeding index, green tea chews and rinses have been shown to positively affect the level of gum inflammation.43 One trial evaluated volunteers who held 2 grams of brewed black tea or unbrewed green tea leaves in the mouth for 2 to 5 minutes. Results showed that this simple use of tea leaves, acted upon by salivary ester- ases, released high levels of catechins and theaflavin gallates into the oral cavity.44 A controlled, clinical, double-blind, crossover study conducted to assess the efficacy of tablets containing green tea extract (equivalent of 1 mg polyphenols for three tablets) on oral volatile sul- fur-containing compounds (VSCs) demonstrated statistically signifi- cant reductions in oral VSC levels immediately (55% reduction) and after 30 minutes (26% reduction).45 Routine prophylaxis, as well as treatment of gum disease, may be well served by the addition of green tea support to standard brushing, flossing, and dental care regimens.


The normal amount of green tea consumed by Japanese and other green tea–drinking cultures is about 3 cups daily or about 3 grams of soluble components, providing roughly 240 to 320 mg of polyphenols. For a green tea extract standardized for 80% total polyphenol and 55% EGCG content, this would mean a daily dose of 300 to 400 mg. When selecting commercial green tea extracts, it is important to look for the level of EGCG as well as total polyphenol content.


Green tea is not associated with any significant side effects or toxicity. As with any caffeine-containing beverage, overconsumption may pro- duce a stimulant effect (e.g., nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, irritability). Consumption of green tea is not associated with liver damage in humans, and green tea infusion and GTE-based beverages are considered safe in the range of historical uses. Use of no-observed-adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) from bolus administration to derive a tolerable upper intake level applying the margin-of-safety concept results in acceptable EGCG- doses lower than those from 1 cup of green tea. In clinical intervention studies, liver effects were not observed after intakes below 600 mg EGCG/ person/day. Thus as a measure of safety, a tolerable upper intake level of 300 mg EGCG/person/day has been proposed for food supplements.46


Populations with marginal or deficient iron status have been shown to have lower serum ferritin or hemoglobin levels, or both, presumably due to iron binding.47 Theoretical concerns have been raised for inter- actions with several drug classes, including amphetamines and antico- agulants due to the caffeine content of green tea, but no interactions have been reported in humans.

## 471CHAPTER 61 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids

medicinal use of cannabis believe the effectiveness of the botanical is due to the entourage effects of all compounds present, including the numerous other cannabinoids beyond CBD and THC. For a detailed discussion of the concept of entourage effects, see Russo (2011).2

# REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

Although recreational and medicinal use of cannabis is federally ille- gal, numerous states allow for its use. The federal scheduling of can- nabis as a controlled substance is based on the legal grounds that the U.S. government considers cannabis (1) to have a high potential for abuse, (2) to have no accepted medical use, and (3) to be unsafe for use under medical supervision. None of these assertions has a scien- tific basis. The extensive historical medical use, modern clinical and pharmacological data supporting numerous uses of cannabis, its safety when used appropriately, and the recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the cannabis drug Epidiolex (GW Pharmaceuticals, United Kingdom; 98% CBD) for the treatment of rare seizure disorders demonstrate that there is little evidence support- ing such a prohibition—and likely never was. It is also clear that the recreational use of cannabis is far safer than that of other restricted, but allowed, substances such as cigarettes and alcohol, similarly suggesting such prohibitions based on safety are not scientifically based. Unfortunately, the U.S. prohibition against cannabis has influ- enced the manner in which the botanical is regulated in other countries and, more importantly, has limited meaningful research from taking place in North America. Fortunately, numerous states have minimally recognized the potential medical use of cannabis, and a few others have recognized the ability to use it safely recreationally. The laws gov- erning the use of cannabis differ state by state and change frequently. Similarly, as evidenced by the FDA approval of Epidiolex, the regula- tory framework of cannabis is evolving, making it necessary to refer to individual state laws and federal policies for current legal status.

# HISTORICAL USE

Numerous medicinal preparations of cannabis have been used and prescribed since the earliest written records of medical history, includ- ing their formal recognition by medical authorities in official pharma- copeias, dispensatories, and materia medicas. Despite this, the plant has remained a source of controversy, possessing a reputation as both a pariah and medical panacea, depending on one’s viewpoint. Fueling the former philosophy is the intoxicating nature of cannabis, which, historical and modern use demonstrates, has negative effects when A C B Fig. 61.1 (A) Cannabis—whole plant.

used in excess and has been the subject of intense political and social demonization and religious prohibition. Representing the more posi- tively biased side of the cannabis story is the discovery of the endocan- nabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is an integral part of human biology consisting of endogenous cannabinoids, most notably anandamide, named after the Sanskrit ananda for “bliss” or “joy” coupled with amide, and the widespread distribution of endocannabinoid receptors throughout the body (CB1 and CB2 receptors). Endocannabinoid receptors occur in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the brain, as well as the pancreas, uterus, bones, and liver.3 Through a wide array of network signaling, canna- binoids have a modulating effect on many physiological systems that are both excitatory and inhibitory. There is a biphasic nature to the effects of cannabinoids on human physiology that is at least partially dependent on the receptor status of patients, that is often unpredict- able until cannabis is administered. Anandamide is a neurotransmitter derived from arachidonic acid and is also synthesized in the uterus in pregnancy, eliciting a modulating effect at various stages of the devel- oping embryo. The widespread distribution of cannabinoid receptors leads to the conclusion by some that anything that can modulate the ECS is beneficial for a myriad of diseases. Although this is mostly accu- rate, it leads lay advocates to believe that cannabis is a beneficial med- icine for all people all the time in all diseases. In reality, beyond the general use of self-medicating with cannabis for the temporary relief of specific symptoms or long-term management of disease states (e.g., epilepsy), cannabinoid therapy should be tailored for individual needs, using preparations that favor specific cannabinoid profiles (i.e., CBD or THC prominence). Cannabis, as with other medications, should be integrated with lifestyle, behavioral, emotional, and/or other botanical or conventional medications that support cannabis therapy and nor- mal physiology. Unfortunately, many resort to cannabis as a symp- tomatic Band-Aid to cope with mild to serious diseases, in the same manner as conventional drugs are used without addressing underlying or lifestyle factors that contribute to the disease state. That being said, aside from the ideal of using cannabis within the context of an integra- tive medical approach, it is a highly safe and effective medicine, with profound pharmacological activities that can be used to positively pro- vide symptomatic relief and, in some cases, alter pathological states. One important consideration regarding reference to the historical use of cannabis is the fact that the THC content of THC-prominent strains was historically much lower than plant material today. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the average percentage of THC in herbal cannabis was less than 1%, although anomalous samples reach- ing 9.5% were reported,4 although this also has to be questioned based on analytical methodologies that were less well developed than they are today. In 1980 the average total THC concentration was approximately 1.5%,5 which rose to approximately 3.3% in 1983 and 1984, fluctuated around 3% until 1992, and increased to 4.2% (average) in 1997. Since 1997, due to the increasing prevalence of cross-breeding for psycho- tropic effects, THC yields have steadily increased to today’s average of approximately 13%.6 In the same time period, other cannabinoid concentrations (e.g., CBD) remained relatively stable.7,8 Another con- sistent theme reflected in the traditional herbal medical literature is that the efficacy of cannabis typically was evident below intoxicating doses, and much of the historical literature suggests that, if unwanted psychotropic effects occurred, too much was given (Fig. 61.2). Another consideration in interpreting the therapeutic benefit of cannabis preparations is the differentiation between subjective and objective metrics of benefit and between short-term feelings of well-being that last only until the psychotropic effects of cannabis wear off (typically a few hours) and require repeated dosing versus long- term positive changes in physiology that last beyond the acute effects of cannabis. For example, the psychotropic effects of cannabis often contribute to a higher tolerance of or disassociation from subjective symptoms such as pain or depression but may not demonstrably alter pathology or lead to a worsening of symptoms. For integrated medical practitioners working with clients for whom cannabis may be used or indicated, these are important considerations. There are many poten- tial benefits from the appropriate therapeutic use of cannabis and many more to be discovered. Following are the primary areas of appli- cation, but this discussion is by no means comprehensive.

## Use in Traditional Healing Systems

Cannabis has been used throughout the world wherever consumers and medical practitioners had access to it. Its use dates to ancient times in Africa, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Rome, and Mesopotamia. The earliest writings of the medical use of cannabis occur on cuneiform bones. Some from approximately 800 bce in Assyria record it as an ingredient in prescriptions. In Assyria, cannabis was named gan-zi- gun-nu (“the drug that takes away the mind”) or azallu when used therapeutically.9 During this time, cannabis was used to treat noctur- nal epilepsy, a use relevant to clinical practice today. 1 9 9 5 T H C ( % ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 7 1 9 9 8 1 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 0 4 2 0 0 5 2 0 0 6 2 0 0 7 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 Fig. 61.2 Change in THC content over past two decades.

## Use in Traditional Chinese Medicine

The seed of Cannabis was discussed in China’s earliest known text dedicated to medicinal therapies, the Shennong Bencao Jing (Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica). In this materia medica, the psychotro- pic effects of cannabis were recognized in the statement that “exces- sive consumption causes one to see ghosts and walk frenetically.” It was further recorded that consuming cannabis over a prolonged time “frees the spirit light and lightens the body.”10 In a 5th-century annotated edition of the Shennong Bencao Jing, the Taoist priest Tao Hongjing reported that Cannabis flower was “toxic,” relieved pain due to “impediment,” and was rarely used in formulas or by healthcare practitioners. Li Shizhen, regarded as the greatest compiler of Chinese materia medica, in his 16th-century Bencao Gangmu, recorded the use of cannabis for “hundred diseases of wind-withdrawal,”11 which is a reference to mental disorders, a traditional category of mental illness characterized by either extreme withdrawal, mania, or both. The flow- ers, seeds, leaves, and stalk were later referenced in a number of other important historical Chinese texts on medicinals, but the vast majority of these and modern textbooks focus only on the use of the seeds. In the modern era, the Zhongyao Daci Dian (Great Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicinals) is arguably the most complete single reference on all parts of the Cannabis plant. In this text, the following uses for the flowers were given: “pain wind,” “withdrawal and mania,” insomnia, and panting and cough. Although the seed is ubiquitous in modern Chinese materia medica and formula literature, relatively few texts include other parts of the Cannabis plant, and no other parts of the plant are commonly used today as part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practice, either in the People’s Republic of China or Taiwan. Some TCM specialists in North America are integrating the medical use of Cannabis into their practices based on the plant’s modern use, however, not always according to TCM theory.

## Use in Ayurveda

According to modern authorities,12,13 cannabis is not featured in the foundational texts of Ayurveda, namely, Caraka Samhita, Su ś ruta Samhita, and V ā gbhata’s A şţā ngahrdayasamhit ā . The use of the leaves medicinally in oral preparations in India was definitively established around the 11th to 12th century ce in Vangasena’s Cikits ā s ā rasamgraha. This text reports on the combination of opium and cannabis as a vyavayin: “a substance which pervades the whole body before being metabolized.” The same text, naming the herb indr ā sana (“food of Indra”) and tribhavanavijaya, includes cannabis as an ingredient in two longevity formulas. The pharmacodynamics of cannabis in Ayurveda (dryavaguna) is most consistently described in the historical literature. In the Mahendrabhogika’s Dhanvantar ī yanighantu of around the 11th cen- tury, cannabis is described as removing humoral phlegm, to be sharp, to aid digestion, and to be light. It is written that because cannabis is sharp and heating, it increases pitta (humorous bile) and pro- vokes delusions, slows speech, and increases the digestive fire.13 The Rajanighantu of the 13th century characterized cannabis properties and functions as acrid, astringent, heating, and pungent; as removing wind and phlegm, promoting speech, giving strength, and inspiring of mental power; and being an excellent excitant.14 In Ayurveda, canna- bis was used as a treatment for fevers to cool heated blood, soothe the overwakeful to sleep, give beauty, and secure length of days. It was also used to treat dysentery and sunstroke, clear phlegm, quicken diges- tion, sharpen the appetite, make the tongue of the lisper plain, freshen the intellect, and give alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. In underscoring the need for appropriate doses, it was also stated that in moderation, cannabis is the best of gifts, but in excess, it causes abscess and even madness.15 The leaves of Cannabis are included in modern editions of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (2001)16 under the name vijay ā , where it is recorded for “sluggishness of the digestive fire” (agnim ā n- dya), which often refers to dyspepsia and loss of appetite, acute diar- rhea (atisara), digestive disturbances (grahan ī roga), malabsorption, impotence (klabiya), and insomnia (anidra).

## Use in Western Medical Traditions

Although cannabis is mentioned in the earliest writings of ancient Western medicine, detailed records of its clinical uses are lacking, focusing predominantly on its use for textiles, ropes, the seed as a cereal grain and providing fewer reports of its intoxicant and medical effects. Irish physician William O’Shaughnessy, who learned of the herb’s use in India, introduced cannabis into Western medical practice in the early 19th century. O’Shaughnessy provided detailed records and per- sonal accounts of the effects and clinical use of cannabis that remain some of the most detailed guidance to date, which included the use of cannabis for relieving tetanus, rheumatic pain, cholera, and infan- tile convulsions. In this latter use, O’Shaughnessy’s experience led him to believe that the anticonvulsant properties of cannabis had no equal and that it was the safest of the powerful narcotics of the time, for example, compared with opium.17 The general effects of cannabis on humans as reported by O’Shaughnessy include alleviation of pain, antispasmodic, a remarkable increase in appetite, unequivocal aphro- disiac, great mental cheerfulness, and at the extreme continuum, delir- ium and a cataleptic state. Cannabis came into use by the eclectic physicians of the United States around 1855 as practitioners learned of its use, partly from German physicians. The primary earliest actions were noted as ano- dyne, hypnotic, nervine, digestive, and antispasmodic, with indications including rheumatic pain accompanied by spasms and contraction that was only marginally responsive to other agents, as a narcotic to induce sleep, for menorrhagia, as a mind-altering drug, and even its use for “insanity” and reducing symptoms of withdrawal (delirium tremens), among other uses. As an anodyne, its action was considered to be less certain than opium but without the common side effects of opium or morphine,18 a use of considerable importance today. This subsequently led to the inclusion of a comprehensive discussion of the herb’s use in Felter and Lloyd’s King’s American Dispensatory,19 in which both the inebriating and medicinal qualities of cannabis are noted. This foundational Eclectic work refers to cannabis as “one of the most important of our remedies” and additionally notes “but, like our best agents, it must not be used indiscriminately,” providing sage advice for its medicinal use today. Cannabis was subsequently entered into the pharmacopeias of many European countries and the United States, where it was officially recognized as a medicinal agent, again attesting to the lack of scientific basis for today’s current scheduling.

# CHEMICAL COMPOSITION

There is a large number and variety of compounds in cannabis, most notably, cannabinoids and terpenes. There are more than 100 cannabinoids that potentially contribute to the activity of can- nabis, of which several are prominent, the most well known being THC and CBD, accompanied by tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), and delta-8-tetra- hydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC) and degradation compounds such as cannabinol (CBN). These compounds occur in the plant in car- boxylic acid forms (e.g., as THC acid [THCA], CBD acid [CBDA], etc.) that are often considered to be relatively inactive but should be considered to possess a weaker or different activity than the decar- boxylated forms of the parent compounds. Although possessing

<!-- chunk -->

## 474SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

some activity, conversion of the acids to their decarboxylated forms, usually by heating, is necessary for their full potential to be reached. For example, THCA lacks intoxicating effects and requires decarbox- ylation to the psychoactive THC. This conversion readily occurs in smoking or baking. Conversely, THCA possesses anti-inflammatory activity.20 Terpenes are volatile compounds that give cannabis its character- istic aroma, taste, and overall sensory characteristics. Although can- nabis contains more than 200 terpenes and sesquiterpenes, like the cannabinoids, several predominate, most notably myrcene (reminis- cent of cloves with hints of citrus), α - and β -pinene (pine aroma), and β -caryophyllene (reminiscent of pepper). Additional terpenoid chemovars include those containing limonene (citrus aroma), lin- alool (floral or sweet aroma), and humulene (reminiscent of hops), to name the primary types (for a more complete discussion, see Giese et al. [2015]).21 Each terpene chemovar is generally believed to offer a unique suite of compounds beneficial for specific conditions and may modulate the effects of cannabinoids. To date, preference for one over another chemovar is highly subjective, based on patient or practitioner perspectives. Whereas the cannabinoid profile and content in a particular chemovar are primarily genetically predetermined, terpenes are much more subject to variability through environmental and growing condi- tions, giving rise to the wide variety of chemovars, fanciful names, and sensory subtleties that exist in the market. There is a host of additional compounds that occur in Cannabis that may contribute to the overall activity of the species. These include carbohydrates (monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar alcohols, cyclitols, and amino sugars), amino acids, amines (piperidine, hordenine, ammonia), noncannabinoid phenols (spiroin- dan-type, dihydrostilbene-type, cannabidihydrophenanthrene deriva- tives, simple phenols, simple phenolic glycosides, and phenol methyl esters), simple alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, lactones, ste- roids (phytosterols and brassinosteroids), vitamins, xanthones, cou- marins, pigments, and alkaloids.22

## Tetrahydrocannabinol

Heating THCA, the form found in the raw plant, results in decar- boxylation to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which affects behavior by influencing both inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutama- tergic terminals in the brain in a dose-dependent fashion. Gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter involved in the communication between the brain and nervous system and is pri- marily responsible for promoting calmness by inhibiting neuronal activity. This has significant clinical implications for anxiety, depres- sion, insomnia, various behavioral disorders, cognition, modula- tion of stress responses, and maintenance of muscle tone. GABA is also expressed in the immune system, where it has a modulating effect on immune responses and thus implications in autoimmune disease.23,24 In contrast to the inhibitory nature of the GABAergic system, the gluatmatergic system is excitatory, with glutamine being the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. Glutamate recep- tors are distributed throughout the spinal cord and brain in neurons and are linked to numerous other neurotransmitter pathways. There is also a close biological relationship between the GABAergic and glu- tamatergic systems in that GABA is synthesized by L-glutamic acid carboxylase, suggesting that, from an evolutionary perspective, the two systems work in tandem in modulating nervous system function between inhibitory and excitatory states.25 There are various clinical implications of the effects of cannabinoids on the endocannabinoids system.

## Cannabidiol

Like THC, CBD is not a naturally occurring cannabinoid in the raw Cannabis plant but rather has to be decarboxylated, usually by heat, from the acid form (CBDA) to CBD. Unlike THC, CBD does not possess the intoxicating activity of THC and is often referred to as lacking psychotropic activity. However, this compound has a marked effect on anxiety, so it can be considered to possess psychotropic effects but lacks the “high” that comes with THC consumption. Like THC, CBD acts on both CB1 and CB2 receptors but to a much lesser degree than THC26 and is often cited as potentially modulating the intoxicating effects of THC. Part of the activity of CBD is its ability to preserve the activity of the endogenous can- nabinoid anandamide, either by preventing its degradation or increasing its uptake. Anandamide effects memory,27 eating, sleep, and pain28,29; inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation30; and may be at least partially responsible for “runner’s high.”30 Increasing the amount of anandamide in the brain has implications in the treat- ment of anxiety and depression.31,32 CBD may also play a role in anxiety and depression through its effect as a serotonin (5HT1A) agonist, on pain through its interaction with TRP receptors, and in reducing inflammation through its ability to inhibit adenos- ine inactivation.26,33–35 One primary area of investigation is the potential for CBD to positively affect numerous neurological and seizure disorders such as psychosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Huntington’s dis- ease, Tourette’s, and numerous other neurological conditions. The use and often-remarkable effects of CBD for seizure disorders in children were popularized by the use of the CBD preparation Charlotte’s Web (Stanley Brothers, Colorado) and the recently FDA-approved CBD preparation Epidiolex.

## Other Nonintoxicating Cannabinoids

There is a host of other cannabinoids that, like CBD, lack the intoxicating effects associated with THC, including cannabig- erol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), D9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (D9-THCV), and cannabidivarin (CBDV) and their acid forms D9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (D9-THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA).36 These compounds occur in lower concentrations than THC and CBD and are often overshadowed by the more pronounced effects of THC and CBD. However, they are pharmacologically active com- pounds affecting both the endocannabinoid system, as well as systems outside of endocannabinoids, and they undoubtedly contribute to the entourage effect. CBN, for example, possesses approximately 10% of the activity of THC; D9-THCV is abundant in hashish from Pakistan and is reported to antagonize the effects of THC; and CBG effects a family of receptors (TRP) involved with sensations such as pain, hot, and cold but also exhibits antitumor activity and displays activity at very low doses. For a discussion of these minor compounds, see Izzo et al. (2009)36 (Table 61.1).


There are many indications for which cannabis is and can be used. Historically, the most common actions of cannabis were as an anes- thetic, antidepressant, anodyne, calmative, appetite stimulant, and sedative. Based on these actions, cannabis was used for a wide array of conditions, including depression, pain management, spastic symp- toms, acute mania, menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea, and wasting syn- dromes. Cannabis was also used topically for swelling, pain, bruises, burns, hemorrhoids, and fungal infections, applications not com- monly employed today.

## 475CHAPTER 61 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids

Most states that allow for the medical use of cannabis include can- cer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and seizures/epilepsy as among the most commonly accepted of medical indications,37,38 usually as adjuvants to other therapies and primarily for relieving symptoms associated with these conditions. Other surveys provide further evidence of additional uses of cannabis in states with medical marijuana laws and include pain, spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, nausea, posttraumatic stress disorder, cachexia, glaucoma, and degenerative neurological conditions.39,40 To date, the most com- prehensive evidence-based reviews of cannabis use come from the National Academy of Science (NAS)26 and the Canadian government (Health Canada).41 The NAS review concluded there was conclusive evidence for an antiemetic effect in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; substantial evidence for moderate reduction of self-reported spasms; limited evidence for effect on clinician-measured spasms; limited evidence for reduction of depressive symptoms; moderate evi- dence for improvement of short-term sleep outcomes; and limited evi- dence for increasing appetite and decreasing weight loss in HIV. The NAS review failed to find supporting evidence for many of the other indications for which cannabis is popularly used. The Health Canada review reports there are varying levels of evi- dence supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids in a myriad of conditions, including pain; movement disorders (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Tourette’s); adjunctive cancer and HIV care; mood, sleep, and psychiatric disorders; alcohol and opioid withdrawal; Alzheimer’s; some gastrointestinal conditions; and potential antican- cer activity. Anecdotal reports of efficacy for use in conditions such as post- traumatic stress syndrome, cancer, and spastic conditions other than multiple sclerosis continue to drive cannabis use, and although lacking in strong formal evidence, these remain consistent uses for which the plant is employed.

## The Endocannabinoid System

Cannabinoid receptors are often described as being separated between CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and CB2 receptors pre- dominantly in the peripheral system. However, although both are preferentially concentrated in different tissues, both are broadly dis- tributed throughout the body. CB1 receptors are highly concentrated in the brain and affect most areas and functions of the brain, affect neurotransmitters, and are highly expressed at GABAergic and gluta- matergic neurons. CB1 is also highly expressed in nonneuronal tissues, including the gastrointestinal, reproductive, and cardiovascular sys- tems, as well as in fat cells, the liver, the pancreas, and skeletal muscle (see Ligresti et al. [2016] and references therein).42 CB2 receptor expression and its functional physiological effects are less well understood than those for CB1 expression and activity. CB2 is highly expressed in various tissues of the immune system, including the spleen, intestines (gut lymphatic tissue), and lymph, and is also found in the brain and retina. One challenge in determining the specific tis- sue distribution and subsequent physiological activity of cannabinoid receptors is due to the fact that CB receptor expression can change with physiological stresses and disease states. For example, greater CB2 expression can occur in inflammatory conditions of the retina, more so than in healthy tissues.42,43 Both receptor types have the ability to activate multiple signaling pathways that affect multiple systems and have the potential to positively influence numerous disease states. The endocannabinoids system has marked effects on neuronal activity, brain development in all stages of development, memory, emotions, appetite, and pain. Other cannabinoid receptors are also present (see Ligresti et al. [2016]),42 and botanicals other than cannabis (e.g., echi- nacea) can influence cannabinoid receptors,44 although both receptor types are highly activated specifically by the psychoactive THC and, to a lesser extent, the relatively minor cannabinoid cannabinol (CBN).

## Appetite Stimulation, Nausea, and Vomiting

Cannabis is well known for its ability to stimulate the appetite and is often used to sustain weight or promote weight gain in anorexia or weight loss associated with acquired immunodeficiency disorders (AIDS) and cancer. To date, no well-designed studies on the effects of cannabis on weight gain have been conducted. There is evidence for appetite stimulation, weight preservation, and weight gain from uncontrolled studies in patients with AIDS44–47 and cancer,48 and animal studies suggest that greatest efficacy is seen with relatively low doses50 because the intoxication that accompanies high-dose cannabis use can impair the ability to initiate feeding. Some small investigational

## 476SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

studies suggest that smoking cannabis can increase caloric intake by 40%.49,50 Other reports note that the increase in calories is mostly from snack foods, not increases in mealtime eating. This is predict- able because CB1 receptors are highly expressed in sweet taste recep- tors.51 Other investigations show an increase in caloric intake but no corresponding weight gain.52 Numerous studies have shown efficacy for appetite stimulation and weight gain for synthetic THC (e.g., Jatoi et al. [2002],53 Nelson et al. [1994],54 Regelson et al. [1976],48 Strasser et al. [2006],55 Struwe et al. [1993], and Timpone et al. [1997]56 among others), but sometimes to a lesser degree than other therapies (e.g., megestrol acetate).53,56 Most studies used orally consumed cannabis, whereas at least one study47 reported comparable effects with smoked cannabis. Cannabis is frequently used to allay nausea and vomiting, with THC generally considered as the primary active ingredient. The formal evidence regarding efficacy is reported as mixed and potentially posi- tively biased, although cannabinoids are more effective than placebo and equally effective as conventional antiemetics.26 Despite the poten- tial for a positive bias in studies, the NAS review reported that there is conclusive or substantial evidence for the effectiveness of cannabis for allaying chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In one study, smoking was found to be more appropriate as a treatment option than pills, due to the inability to ingest oral forms when nauseous, but also due to higher blood levels of THC that are achieved with smoking.57 Synthetic cannabinoids (nabilone and dronabinol) were initially approved in 1985 for treating nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetics. However, a number of studies and reviews since then report that THC or crude cannabis preparations are more effective than these approved THC analogs and are often equally effec- tive as or more effective than other conventional antiemetic agents (for reviews, see NAS [2017],26 Chang et al. [1979],58 Lauritsen et al. [2016],59 and Whiting et al. [2015]59). One important note regarding the use of cannabis as an appetite stimulant is that an increase in calories does not always result in an increase in weight gain because calories are often increased with simple sugars and snack foods, rather than increases at mealtime. Although weight gain has been reported in patients with HIV/AIDS using can- nabis, cannabinoids are also reportedly less effective than progesterone megestrol acetate in improving appetite.26 The use of cannabis for allaying morning sickness has also been reported and is regarded by some as safe and others as contraindicated due to mixed evidence on the potential negative effects of cannabis on the developing fetus (see “Use in Pregnancy”).

## Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes

Cannabis, and in particular, CBD, has gained fame in recent years for its ability to dramatically decrease the severity of seizure disorders in children, conditions that in one third of cases are not effectively treated with conventional therapies. The use was stimulated by parental med- ication of their children with a CBD preparation (initially Charlotte’s Web), in some cases with an almost complete control of seizures in some children with Dravet syndrome. One group of investigators evaluated 214 patients with intractable Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.56 A 39% and 50% reduction in motor seizures was observed in subjects with Dravet and Lennox- Gastaut, respectively. There was a mean reduction in motor seizures of 30% over the 12-week period. The same research group60 reported a 50% reduction in seizures in 43% of subjects with Dravet syndrome. At the end of the therapy, a small percentage (5%) was completely sei- zure-free. In subjects with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, an almost 69% reduction in average monthly atonic seizures was observed, with 21% of subjects free of atonic seizures and 3% completely free of seizures during the last 4 weeks of therapy. The majority of caregivers (62%) reported improvement in the overall condition of the children given Epidiolex, compared with 34% of caregivers in the placebo group. There was no significant reduction in nonconvulsive seizures. Adverse effects were reported in 93% of treatment subjects, 89% of which were mild or moderate, and 75% of which were attributed to the medi- cation. Some of the adverse effects were due to a potentiation of the effects of other medications taken. The most common adverse effects included sleepiness, vomiting, fatigue, elevated body temperature, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and elevated liver enzymes.60 In 2018 Epidiolex, a concentrated CBD oil (>98% CBD), was approved in the United States for the treatment of Dravet and Lennox- Gastaut syndromes that are resistant to standard treatments.

## Epilepsy

Cannabis is widely employed in other types of seizure disorders, such as epilepsy, a long-standing historical indication61 and an approved indication under the U.S. compassionate drug use program, in which select patients in the program are provided legally obtained canna- bis as a seizure management tool. Numerous studies of a variety of designs demonstrate the efficacy of cannabis in reducing the incidence of epileptic seizures. In a case series of patients treated in U.S. epilepsy centers, a reduction in seizures of 36.5% was observed compared with baseline over a 12-week treatment period. In Israel, where the medical benefits of cannabis have been extensively studied for decades, 18% of children with epilepsy experienced a 75% to 100% reduction in seizure frequency, 34% experienced a 50% to 75% reduction, 12% reported a 25% to 50% reduction, and 26% reported a reduction of less than 25%. Aggravation of seizures was reported in 7% of subjects and led to a discontinuation of the treatment.62 Tzadok et al.63 reported on the use of cannabis in the treatment of seizure disorders represented by 272 cases in Washington state and California. Of these cases, cannabis was ineffective at reducing seizures in 14% (37) of subjects, 15% (29) experienced a 1% to 25% seizure reduction, 18% (60) a 26% to 50% reduction, 17% (45) a 51% to 75% reduction in seizures, 28% (75) a 76% to 99% reduction, and 10% (26) experienced a complete clinical response. Across patients studied in this review, 86% experienced some clinical benefit. Generally speaking, adverse effects were mild, and 4% of patients experienced an exacerbation of seizures. In these subjects, there was a wide range of effective cannabinoid doses, ranging from 0.05 to 9 mg/kg/day, and effective serum levels of CBD ranging from 1.8 to 80 ng/mL, showing a wide variation that makes it challenging to determine the most appropriate dose, which is highly individual- ized.63 Some patients also included THC or THCA in their treatments. A similar reduction (84%) in seizures was reported in another survey of parents of children with seizure disorders who administered canna- binoid preparations to the children. Other beneficial effects included increased alertness, better mood, and improved sleep. Side effects included drowsiness and fatigue.64 In a different report, seizures were exacerbated in 18% of subjects using a cannabis preparation62 (see “Adverse Effects”). Although cannabis preparations are not effective for all subjects with seizure disorders, for those in which it is effective, the benefits can be remarkable. However, different subjects respond to different preparations and dosages. Although CBD has received a considerable amount of attention, some subjects require at least small amounts of THC. Others appear to respond to noncarboxylated prepara- tions dominant in the nonpsychoactive THCA, whereas others may respond best to chemovars that favor one terpene over another (e.g., linalool).

## 477CHAPTER 61 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids

Not treating patients who could benefit from cannabis as a novel therapy, treating with illicit or poorly characterized products in states where cannabis prohibition is still in place, and not having appropri- ate guidance in how to dose all carry a wide array of consequences in which the benefits must be weighed against the risk. One key consid- eration is the fact that cannabis has been widely effective in relatively large numbers of people, including children, with refractory seizure disorders. Their parents, often against great odds and with tremendous personal risk, are responsible for raising awareness about its poten- tial benefit. For a more comprehensive review of the use of cannabis in seizure disorders and the pharmacological mechanisms involved, see Devinsky et al. (2016, 2017),59,60 Russo (2017),61 Stockings et al. (2018),65 and Whalley (2014),66 among others.

## Multiple Sclerosis

Approximately 20% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) use can- nabis for reducing MS symptoms,67 and MS is one of the most com- monly accepted diseases for the use of the plant in states where medical cannabis is approved. The NAS review concluded there was conclusive evidence for improving patient-reported symptoms associated with MS spasticity symptoms and limited clinical evidence for improvement of clinician-measured MS spasticity symptoms.26 There is preclinical evidence of potential objective benefit based on anti-inflammatory properties associated with cannabis, with specific evidence suggesting a protective effect on neurons in MS models in mice.68 Conversely, clinical evidence regarding the ability of cannabis to change disease progression is lacking.69 In formal clinical trials, the majority of evidence for efficacy is based on the investigation of the cannabis preparation Sativex, which is used as an oromucosal spray delivering 2.7:2.5 mg/100 μ L THC:CBD, respectively. Most authoritative, evidence-based reviews report that information regarding the potential benefits of cannabis for MS is lim- ited and that cannabis may be effective for relieving some symptoms (pain, spasticity, lack of bladder control, sleep) of MS.69,198

There are limited data on the use of cannabis in other movement dis- orders, including Huntington’s disease,70–72 Tourette’s,73 Parkinson’s disease,74–76 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.77 Most evidence for these conditions comes from individual case reports, surveys, or pilot studies and is limited to a reduction of symptoms associated with these conditions, including anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive dis- order, spasms, spastic rigidity, and mild psychosis. As a point of his- torical interest, a cannabis tincture (Squire’s Extract) was used for the relief of symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease beginning in the 1800s.

## Pain

Cannabis has been used for the treatment of pain since as early as the 12th century. Formal reviews report there is conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for the treatment of chronic pain in adults. Pain is one of the most common conditions resulting in medical marijuana prescriptions, and an oromucosal spray (Sativex) of a whole Cannabis plant extract (THC:CBD, approximately 1:1) is approved for use in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Canada, specifically for the treatment of pain and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.26 Most studies, including a meta-analysis, investigating the use of cannabis in relieving pain, are in patients also suffering from other conditions, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, or MS, and cannabis seems to be most effective for neuropathic pain.78 Preclinical research on can- nabis and pain has been carried out since 1899, at which time dogs exposed to cannabis inhalation failed to respond to pin-prick stimuli.79 Relief of pain by cannabis appears to be due to multiple mechanisms that include direct analgesia, anti-inflammatory activity, and modula- tion of neurotransmitters and endogenous opioids.80 Several studies, most with a placebo as a comparator and using different prepara- tions, including smoking and extracts, reported significant reduction in neuropathic pain. Some subjects respond positively to low doses, whereas in others, high doses that are accompanied by intoxication were needed. Perhaps the most poignant observation suggesting the widespread efficacy of cannabis in pain management is the use of can- nabis resulting in a 64% reduction in opioid use81 and an almost 25% reduction in opioid fatalities in states with medical marijuana laws.82


Cannabis is frequently used by cancer patients, both for allaying the symptoms associated with the disease, such as appetite loss, chemo- therapy-induced nausea, depression, insomnia, and pain, as well as in an attempt to reduce tumor growth, based on a plethora of anecdotal reports and preclinical research suggesting direct anticancer activity (for reviews, see McAllister et al. [2015],83 Patil et al. [2015],84 Ramer and Hinz [2016],85 Soliman et al. [2016],86 Velasco et al. [2016]87). Cannabis is clearly beneficial for allaying symptoms associated with cancer and conventional cancer therapies.88 Regarding pain control, the studies that have been conducted suggest that cannabis (smoked and vaporized) can alleviate chronic pain and can be effective when con- ventional therapies have failed. A single large-scale cohort study (the California Men’s Health Study [CMHS]) reported an approximately 45% reduction in the incidence of bladder cancer in male subjects who reported cannabis use versus those who did not. The cohort included more than 82,000 subjects who were followed for 11 years. Conversely, an increase in bladder cancer incidence was reported in those who reported smoking tobacco only.89 Although causality could not be ascertained, the results are suggestive of a potential protective effect of cannabis on the incidence of bladder cancer. Results of an open-label longitudinal study demonstrated that patients with chronic pain that was resistant to conventional therapies found relief with cannabis oil. As is typical of historical medical dosing, patients started at a low dose of one drop daily, increasing in increments of one drop per dose, three times daily, until satisfactory analgesia was achieved or until side effects appeared. In these oil preparations, the THC concentrations ranged from 11% to 19% and 0.5% to 5.5% CBD.90 In some studies, plant extracts were reported to be preferred over synthetic cannabinoids.88 Numerous preclinical studies demonstrate that a number of can- nabinoids (e.g., THC, CBD, CBG, CBC, CBDA) can inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and also elicit a variety of antineoplastic effects in vivo. However, the in vivo doses used are generally magnitudes higher than is typically consumable to be clinically relevant. A formal evidence-based review of the cannabis literature concluded there was substantial or conclusive evidence for the use of cannabi- noids in chemotherapy-induced nausea.26 There are mechanistic data suggesting that cannabis has direct anticancer activity, but there are no formal trials supporting a clinically relevant benefit. Conversely, there is widespread belief that cannabis holds great potential as an anticancer compound, leading to the popularization of high-dose THC protocols (e.g., Rick Simpson protocol) in an attempt to decrease tumor growth. No formal investigations of these protocols have been conducted. Topical cannabis preparations are also popularly used for skin can- cers but lack any formal evidence regarding efficacy.

use program. There is an abundance of cannabinoid receptors in the tissues of the eyes. There is some evidence that THC reduces the intra- ocular pressure in the eye that accompanies glaucoma, but the effects seem to be transient (a few hours), and tolerance to the beneficial effects seems to develop over time.91,92 Benefits were observed with an oral mucosal spray delivering 5 mg sublingual and up to 20 mg THC, and sublingual administration of 40 CBD caused a similarly transient increase in intraocular pressure.93

## Addiction

Although cannabis has its own dependence-causing potential, both clinical and preclinical trials demonstrate it also has therapeutic appli- cation in the treatment of addictions to alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine, opioids, and stimulants, including the use of CBD (200–800 mg) for the treatment of cannabis dependence,94 although the results of the available studies are mixed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anxiety, Depression, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

There is a wide variety of evidence supporting the anxiolytic activity of cannabis. Although a small subset of the population experiences para- noia or agitation with cannabis use, and inexperienced users are more susceptible to agitation than experienced users, a large segment of the population experiences an anxiolytic effect. The benefit is especially evi- dent for those suffering from other conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, can- cer, and MS. Both THC-predominant chemovars and CBD are used. Some of the effects of THC are dose dependent, with low doses eliciting anxiolytic and mood-elevating effects and high doses and chronic use resulting in anxiety and an increased propensity for depression. There are numerous anecdotal reports of the potential for both CBD and cannabis in general to relieve the symptoms of PTSD and, in some cases, to act as a reset that allows those with PTSD to reex- perience joy and happiness, although again, results are mixed. Some investigations reveal that those with PTSD have relatively low concen- trations of circulating endocannabinoids.95 Much of the clinical work that is available was done with synthetic cannabinoids and shows ben- efit. A few studies investigated both THC and CBD. In one study, patients with PTSD who received 2.5 to 10 mg THC mg experienced improvements in symptom severity, sleep quality, fre- quency of nightmares, and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms.96 Targeting the endocannabinoid system has been described “as a possible ideal therapeutic target to treat both the emotional and cognitive dysfunc- tions characterizing PTSD.”97 The use of cannabis for PTSD is an approved indication in a number of states with medical marijuana laws, and there is generally a higher frequency of cannabis use in those suffering from PTSD, primarily for improving sleep.98 Conversely, subjects with excessively high consumption of high-potency cannabis preparations, such as butane hash oil, report higher rates of anxiety and depression and are also prone to greater use of other illicit drugs and higher levels of physical dependence compared with those using crude high-potency herbal cannabis preparations.99 There is a biological relationship between cannabinoids and men- tal health. Anandamide levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients are elevated in patients in early-stage psychosis, and there is an abundance of evidence of either a causal or associative relationship between excessive THC-predominant cannabis use and increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia. There are numerous anecdotal reports of cannabis relieving the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, most notably for mood elevation and relief of anxiety and boredom.100 However, despite subjective temporary relief of symptoms, ongoing cannabis use contributes to a worsening of schizophrenia, whereas cannabis cessation is associated with improved general health and cog- nition and a reduction in depression and psychotic symptoms.101 The negative effect of cannabis on psychosis and schizophrenia appears to be predominantly due to THC. Perhaps of greater rele- vance is that evidence suggests that substance abuse and symptoms associated with schizophrenia share similar neurological imbalances, making it difficult to determine whether the relationship is causal or associative.102,103 Still, the available data suggest that cannabis use in those with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders results in a greater likelihood of relapse, longer hospital admissions, poorer adherence to treatment protocols, and greater need for psychiatric care, and the association is dose dependent, with strong strains producing the worst outcomes.104 Conversely, CBD appears to lessen the negative effects of THC and even be of therapeutic benefit in relieving symptoms associ- ated with psychosis and schizophrenia.105–108 In preclinical investigations, CBD at doses equivalent to 1.25 to 10 mg/kg in humans reduced the psychotic-producing effects of THC.109,110 Similar effects were reported in human studies where increasing concentrations of CBD relative to THC (2:1 ratio of CBD:THC) reduced the intensity of the psychoactive effects of THC.103 Another human study demonstrated that CBD blocked a number of negative effects associated with THC alone, including depersonaliza- tion, disconnected thoughts, paranoid ideas, and anxiety.

## Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia

In recent years there have been reports of the potential use of canna- bis for reducing symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s and dementia, primarily based on preclinical research and case reports of symptom- atic improvement. There is a relatively strong physiological basis for a potential benefit of cannabis in Alzheimer’s because the brains of deceased patients with Alzheimer’s contain lower levels of anandamide compared with matched control subjects.111 A number of other phys- iological mechanisms associated with THC have been proposed as potential targeted therapies in Alzheimer’s disease, including the abil- ity of low-dose THC to stimulate mitochondrial activity.112 In one animal study, CBD (2.5 and 10 mg/kg/day) inhibited inflammatory mediators in an experimental model of Alzheimer’s-related neuroin- flammation.113 Conversely, a 2009 formal review of the use of cannabis for dementia found insufficient evidence of clinical efficacy,114 whereas a more recent study of a medicated cannabis oil preparation reported a reduction of symptoms of delusions, agitation/aggression, irritability, apathy, sleep, and caregiver distress in patients with dementia.115

<!-- chunk -->

## Sleep Disorders

Cannabis has been used to promote sleep for centuries. There is evi- dence that suggests the endocannabinoid system has a role in sleep. THC is associated with changes in slow-wave sleep, which is critical for learning and memory consolidation, both of which factor into normal sleep cycles. The effects of cannabis are dose dependent, decreasing time to sleep onset at low doses and increasing time to sleep onset at higher doses.116 Most of the research has been conducted with syn- thetic cannabinoids. According to the NAS review (2017),26 there is moderate evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for improving short-term sleep outcomes in individuals with sleep distur- bance associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and multiple sclerosis, primarily synthetic THC.


The dosing of cannabis preparations is highly variable.117–119 Complicating the dosage determination is differentiating between the chemovar, terpene type and concentration, THC concentration, bipha- sic effects (low doses—1 mg THC or less—may stimulate, whereas larger doses can decrease activity, and vice versa), and the ratio of THC

<!-- chunk -->

## 479CHAPTER 61 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids

to CBD. Responses to cannabis are highly variable as well and very much dose dependent. When prescribing cannabis therapeutically, the dosage should start low (e.g., 1 mg THC) and move up as needed. Surveys of self-use suggest the average consumer taking cannabis for medicinal purposes uses from 1 to 3 g daily.41 The U.S. national aver- age for cannabis is 13% THC; this equates to a potential 130 mg to mg of THC, although not 100% of the available THC is consumed. This is an extremely high dose compared with historical dosing regi- mens. Formal clinical trials of standardized preparations provide more exact doses for modern use. The onset of effects differs between different preparations. The average time of onset for the various preparations is as follows: • Smoking/vaporizing 6.5 to 7 minutes • Tea 29 minutes • Edibles and tinctures 46 minutes However, response and detoxification rate vary widely. Another challenge is determining the dosage, which is greatly affected by form, concentration, and species. There is great variation in the literature between research studies and community use. In addition, the actual amount of THC and CBD in a product varies widely in the various types of extracts. Table 61.2 lists dosing regimens based on histori- cal literature and surveys of typical use across studies internationally. These should be taken as relative guidelines. Individual patients and practitioners are recommended to start at the lowest dose and increase according to the desired effect and subject tolerability.

# SAFETY

<!-- chunk -->

## Adverse Effects

Historically, Cannabis was considered a safe herb to use for appropri- ate medical indications and with appropriate caution. Historical writers often reported that if symptoms of intoxication occurred, too much was given and the dose should be reduced. A similar observation has been made by experienced clinicians who often observe benefits at doses below intoxication thresholds (Sulak, personal communication, unreferenced). The safety profile of cannabis has changed over the decades as intensive interbreeding has increased THC levels from a historical concentration of 3% or less to a U.S. national average of 13%. Some preparations available today can be as high as 60% THC, which changes the landscape of canna- bis safety with the side-effect potential first and foremost dose dependent and correlated with increasing THC concentrations. Despite increasing THC concentrations, when used with appropriate caution, cannabis is safe both when self-medicating and prescribed. The same adverse-effect profile is not evident with the use of nonintoxicating cultivars or prepa- rations of cannabis, such as those based predominantly on hemp or CBD. Details of the mechanisms associated with adverse effects are pro- vided in the primary literature. Following is a basic overview of the primary safety considerations regarding cannabis. For more detailed and comprehensive information, refer to the primary literature. The primary adverse effects that are correlated with THC intox- ication include dizziness, sedation, euphoria, cognitive impairment, transient impairment of sensory and perceptual functions, clumsiness, dry mouth, hypotension, or increased heart rate. Most of these adverse effects are tolerable in healthy adults. The seriousness of most canna- bis-induced adverse effects is similar to those experienced with other medications and is manageable with appropriate observation and care. More serious adverse effects associated with excessive THC exposure include panic attacks, severe anxiety, cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, psychosis, paranoia, hallucinations, and convulsions.41

## Traditional Cautions

In the traditional Ayurvedic literature (Ananadakanda), nine stages of cannabis side effects were recognized: (1) red eyes and hot breath with dry tongue, lips, palate, and nose; (2) closed eyes and rigid body; (3) burning feeling in the feet, hands, eyes and a choking voice; (4) hunger and thirst, sleepy eyes, and rolling eyes; (5) a choking voice and forget- fulness of recent events; (6) complete amnesia; (7) weakness in upper limbs and body and prostration; (8) disorientation and weeping; and finally, (9) shouting, fainting, coma, eructation, groaning, rolling on the ground, difficulty speaking, incoherence, disclosure of secret feelings, misery, and collapse.120 In traditional Chinese medicine, excessive con- sumption was said to cause one to see ghosts and walk frenetically.10 In early American herbal traditions, the noted Eclectic physician John Uri Lloyd117 described cannabis as “one of the most important of our remedies . . . but, like our best agents, it must not be used indiscrimi- nately.” Thus a number of the major herbal traditions recognized both the benefit and potential for adverse effects inherent in the use of can- nabis. Acute symptoms subside with discontinued use. However, psy- chomotor impairment, specifically regarding attention and critical task performance, remain impaired despite three weeks of abstinence.121

## Intoxication (the “High”)—Typical Use

The most common effects that can be considered either desired or adverse, depending on the user and intent, are associated with intoxication when using THC-predominant strains. Short-term intoxication effects of recre- ational use include euphoria, relaxation, and loss of inhibition; time- and spatial distortion; and intensification of sensory experiences, such eating or listening to, music followed by a depressant period.122,123 Cannabis use is associated with impaired function in a variety of cognitive and short- term memory tasks and can result in significant impairment of motor functions, such as slowed or distorted reaction times. Some experience dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, depression, and paranoia.124 Increased appe- tite and rapid heart rate are relatively common physiological effects.125–128

anatomical, physiological, and psychological consequences. In addi- tion to negative respiratory effects, excessive use of cannabis can result in structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain,129–131 increased risk of pancreatitis,132 sperm abnormalities,133 downreg- ulation of CB1 receptors,134 and dependence. Some of these changes reverse with discontinuation of cannabis use. However, the developing nervous system of young people is more susceptible to adverse effects. Psychologically, high-dose chronic cannabis use is associated with anx- iety, depression, bipolar disorders, cognitive dysfunctions, and in ado- lescent users, increased risk of schizophrenia in subjects predisposed to schizophrenic disorders. Again, negative effects generally reverse quickly, although cognitive deficits can persist for up to 1 year.135–139

<!-- chunk -->

## Respiratory Effects—Smoking

There are mixed data on the effects of cannabis smoking on the lungs. Some studies report that cannabis smoking has similar negative effects on the lungs as cigarette smoking, with the exception that there seems to be no definitive correlation between cannabis smoking and lung cancer. However, some studies suggest that smoking marijuana leaves is more carcinogenic than smoking tobacco leaves, and some studies report clear lung damage (e.g., Aldington [2007]140). The compre- hensive review of the available studies by Health Canada41 reports there is no definitive risk, although the review provides a caution that smoking should generally be avoided. The most common respiratory symptoms self-reported for cannabis smoking by cannabis smokers include chronic bronchitis, cough, and phlegm.141,142 Other respira- tory symptoms that have been reported include shortness of breath and wheezing143,144 and unusual conditions that include spontaneous pneumothorax,145 bullous lung disease,144 and barotrauma,144,146 all of which are rare and for which causation is not definitive.145 These unusual conditions are thought to result from the deep inhalation and holding of smoke in the lungs associated with cannabis smoking and are confounded by other factors, such as cigarette smoking. The holding of smoke in the lungs is linked to higher concentrations of tar, carbon monoxide, and THC in the lungs.147 To date, no concerns have been reported for negative respiratory effects associated with non- smoking exposure, and inhalation using a clean-technology vaporizer can minimize some of the risks of smoking.

## Pediatric Intoxication (Intentional/Unintentional)

An unintended consequence with changing laws regarding cannabis has been an increased frequency in exposure to cannabis in children, or at least the reporting of such events. Perhaps the incidence of child- hood exposure was the same before legalization, but the criminality of cannabis may have prevented parents from reporting accidental exposures. In children, the most common symptoms reported after acute ingestion include central nervous system (CNS) depression (e.g., lethargy, coma), confusion, agitation, and ataxia. Nausea and vom- iting have also been reported, as well as drowsiness/lethargy, ataxia/ dizziness, agitation, vomiting, tachycardia, dystonia/muscle rigidity, respiratory depression, bradycardia/hypotension, and seizures.148 Exposures can be related to both medical use and, more commonly, unintentional consumption of edible preparations, which is of partic- ular concern with children.149 Unintentional exposures are primarily due to lack of supervision or poor product storage controls of parents. According to a review of poison control center data, the majority of exposures are provided palliative treatments, evaluated, and released without intensive medical care, although some are referred to inten- sive care for intubation. To date, there are no reports of unintentional intoxications causing permanent disability or death in children, and symptoms generally subside as the effects of cannabis wear off, usually within a few hours.

## Effects on Driving

Cannabis significantly impairs motor functions, the impairment of which is proportional to the THC exposure and effects experienced, which are highly variable between consumers. There are mixed data regarding the incidence and fatalities associated with car accidents in states in the years following cannabis legalization. Some data suggest increases in accidents and fatalities, whereas others suggest decreases. In comparison, the risk of an accident is 5 to 30 times greater with impairment due to alcohol.150 The available data must also be interpreted cautiously. The inci- dence of cannabis-related accidents may be underestimated due to the time lapse between an accident, especially those that are fatal, and anal- ysis of blood THC levels.151 Conversely, the detection of small amounts of THC in the blood does not mean the driver was impaired or that cannabis was the cause of or contributed to an accident. Results of laboratory experiments demonstrate that chronic use of cannabis negatively affects the long-term psychomotor and cognitive performance of drivers; the effects improve after 3 weeks of abstinence, but users do not recover completely.152

<!-- chunk -->

## Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome

Chronic use of cannabis has been associated with severe cyclic vom- iting in a small subset of cannabis users, leading to the development of a new clinical condition known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syn- drome (CHS). Most subjects experiencing this are chronic heavy users smoking a few times weekly to several times daily. CHS is divided into three stages: (1) morning nausea, fear of vomiting, normal eat- ing patterns, and abdominal discomfort that can last for years, as well as continued cannabis use, sometimes due to the belief that cannabis will reduce their nausea (preemetic or prodromal phase); (2) sud- den onset of intense, profuse, persistent, and incapacitating nausea and vomiting up to five times per hour, with some patients reporting abdominal pain and weight loss (hyperemetic phase). When present- ing to the emergency room, these subjects are generally dehydrated. (3) Treatment with antiemetics and fluids usually results in the cessation within 48 hours (recovery phase). Patients also often learn that fre- quent hot bathing provides temporary relief from the acute hyperem- esis.153 The mechanism associated with CHS is not definitively known but is related to a derangement of cannabinoid receptor signaling, and complete resolution of the condition with cannabis cessation has been reported.154,155 Some patients experience relief by application of topi- cal capsaicin (0.075% preparation) to the abdomen.156

<!-- chunk -->

## Edibles—Special Caution

Oral consumption of cannabis in edible preparations requires particular caution due to a 35-minute to 2-hour latency between consumption and effects and effects that can last for up to 8 hours.26 Unlike smoking, in which the effects occur within minutes and can be self-titrated, oral con- sumption can result in overconsumption of THC concentrations that are higher than expected or desired, resulting in negative adverse effects that can be severe, such as acute psychotic effects. Additionally, analyt- ical methodologies for testing the THC concentration in edibles is not well established, and so the THC concentration of edible preparations may not be accurately disclosed, or the amount of THC delivered in edi- bles may have poor homogeneity control. Particular care must be taken when consuming edibles because fatalities with the consumption of edi- bles, predominantly due to psychotic episodes, have occurred.156–158

## Treatment of Intoxication

In most cases, no treatment of cannabis intoxication is needed. Mild intoxication is primarily only troublesome for inexperienced users,

<!-- chunk -->

## 481CHAPTER 61 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids

and the most marked effects wear off relatively quickly (typically 1.5 hours), requiring no more than reassurance and supportive therapy. More marked intoxication may benefit from pharmacological support with benzodiazepines. Severe intoxication, such as can occur with edi- bles, may require restraint in individuals experiencing acute psychotic episodes to prevent them causing harm to oneself or others.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adverse Effects Based on Clinical Trials

The most detailed reports of adverse events associated with formal medical use can be discerned from controlled clinical trials conducted with standardized preparations and administered under medical supervision. In a review of cannabinoid studies over a period of years, dizziness was reported as the primary adverse effect experienced by patients. In these studies, almost 97% of adverse effects experienced were considered nonserious.162 Other common side effects experi- enced with cannabis use include lightheadedness, sleepiness, gastro- intestinal upset, and dry mouth in short-term studies. In longer-term studies, many of these side effects subside, which is typical as patients become accustomed to (tolerant of) the effects of cannabis. A certain degree of tolerance for some of the symptoms associated with canna- bis intoxication can occur in 4 to 10 days.163 However, gastrointestinal (GI) upset and negative cognitive effects can persist, and subjects can experience more pain compared with those taking placebo.64,159,160 Adverse events typically occur within 20 minutes of dosing and resolve completely within 3.5 hours. According to one report, seizures were exacerbated in 18% of sub- jects using a cannabis preparation.62 Inability to sleep, drowsiness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and GI upset were other common adverse effects, with an overall mean adverse-effects incidence of approxi- mately 11% of subjects.62 Assessing adverse events in children is par- ticularly challenging, as is the use of illicit preparations in states where medical cannabis is not allowed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cannabis Dependence

There are a number of adverse effects that can occur with long-term excessive cannabis use. As with excessive use of other drugs, there is a potential for abuse, dependence, and withdrawal in some heavy users, which is most commonly designated as cannabis use disorder (CUD). Dependence has both physical and psychological aspects and is very much individualized between those with a propensity for dependence and those without such a propensity. There is evidence for both phys- ical and psychological dependence to occur with excessive cannabis use, and dependence can be mild to severe. Mild withdrawal symp- toms can include headache, lack of appetite, and restlessness; stronger withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, insomnia, and depression, whereas more severe symptoms can include sweating, fever, chills, and hallucinations.161 Mild symptoms usually subside in only a few days.162 Although there are no formally approved pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of withdrawal, interestingly, there is evidence that CBD is potentially beneficial for cannabis dependence.94

## Amotivational Syndrome

Long-term excessive cannabis use has been reported to contribute to amotivational syndrome, characterized by apathy and an inability to function effectively and, in some, long-term depression. Conversely, it can be debated that many excessive cannabis users are predisposed to exhibit amotivational tendencies rather than cannabis being causative, although abstinence results in a resolution of some symptoms.163

<!-- chunk -->

## Toxicity of Cannabidiol

Most adverse effects associated with cannabis are both THC and dose dependent, with side effects worsening with excessive use of THC-rich preparations. In formal trials with the CBD preparation (Epidiolex), adverse events were reported in 75% to 93% of patients. The majority of these (89%) were reported as mild or moderate in severity. Adverse events reported with CBD (20 mg/kg body weight) in one study included diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, increased body temperature, sleepiness, and abnormal results on liver-function tests, although some of these may have been associated with concomitant antiseizure med- ications.60 A thorough review of CBD safety was published by Iffland and Grotenhermen (2017),164 who report that CDB has a generally favorable side-effect profile and possesses less side effects than stan- dard antiseizure medications and, because of this, helps in improving compliance with standard treatments.

## Use in Pregnancy and Childhood Development

There is a long history of the use of cannabis in pregnancy, primarily for allaying morning sickness and facilitating childbirth by promoting labor, although in labor reportedly accompanied with much pain.165 Cannabis is often used to help allay the nausea and vomiting due to morning sickness, with an estimate that 5% of pregnant women in the United Kingdom166 and one in 20 pregnant women in the United States use cannabis.167 In small doses for the acute relief of labor pain and nausea, cannabis use is generally believed to be safe for the mother. A formal investigation of the effects of low-dose cannabis in the neo- nate from conception to beyond delivery has not been undertaken. Data suggest that pregnant women who use cannabis during preg- nancy are more likely to be daily users and are more likely to meet the criteria for cannabis use disorders than nonpregnant women.168,169 Those using cannabis during pregnancy also have numerous other behaviors that make the interpretation of effects difficult, such as other drug use or high-risk sociodemographic status. However, when such factors are taken into account, risks remain. Expectant mothers using cannabis are also reported to gain more weight than nonusers.170 THC can cross the placental barrier, raising the concern that exces- sive cannabis exposure can have a negative effect on the developing fetus.171,172 In some studies, excessive cannabis exposure in pregnancy was associated with lower-than-average birth weight, height, and head circumference170,173–175; the differences were small but statistically significant.176 Other studies confirmed the lower-than-average birth weight but failed to show changes in head circumference and height.177 Other evidence suggests that using cannabis two or more times per week can increase the risk of premature birth.174,178 There are a number of studies establishing negative neonatal effects associated with excessive cannabis use, although the data are also mixed and of poor quality, making interpretation difficult. There is evidence to suggest that in utero cannabis exposure may negatively affect long- term growth and neurodevelopment, particularly in terms of cognition and behavior. Some of the primary adverse effects reported include lower memory scores, attention problems, hyperactivity and impul- sivity in early childhood, problems with executive functioning later in life, and a greater likelihood of developing emotional and behavioral problems, such as depression and delinquent behavior.168 In the most comprehensive review to date, data on the develop- mental effects of cannabis from pregnancy (“first hit to the endocanna- binoid system”) to 22 years of age was summarized.179 In one study, the gestational age of the neonate was decreased, whereas in another, can- nabis exposure was associated with changes in birth length and weight in the first and third trimesters, respectively, but the findings between the studies were contradictory. In newborns, there was a decreased response to light and an increase in startle response and tremors, as well as a decrease in body length. The most effects were seen in the developing infant to 6 years old, with increases in motor skills, impul- sivity, hyperactivity, nocturnal arousals, wake time after sleep onset,

delinquency, and aggression in girls and decreases in memory, verbal reasoning, mental development, short-term memory, sleep efficiency, concentration, IQ scores, and attention. The nature of these studies does not allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn. However, con- sidering that the endocannabinoid system is integral to neurological development, it is not surprising that neurodevelopment changes can occur with exposure to cannabinoids.

<!-- chunk -->

## Risk of Psychosis and Schizophrenia

In addition to the developmental effects reported previously, there appears to be a strong association between heavy adolescent cannabis use and an increased risk of schizophrenia. Some studies suggest there is a sixfold risk with heavy cannabis exposure, and there appears to be a greater risk for those genetically predisposed to schizophrenia.180 Some consider cannabis an independent risk factor for psychosis as well, although there is evidence that also suggests that cannabis users who experience an initial psychotic episode have fewer neurological abnor- malities than nonusers.181 Animal data demonstrate that chronic expo- sure of cannabinoid agonists during the periadolescent period causes persistent behavioral alterations in adult animals. Although it is clear that cannabis can be used to provide symptomatic relief of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and psychosis, other researchers have continued to build a body of evidence suggesting caution in its use.182 One of the more interesting findings in the literature on cannabis and reproductive issues is an association with heavy prenatal, gesta- tional, and postnatal cannabis use in males and an increased risk of sudden infant sudden syndrome (SIDS).183 The reason for this has not been definitively ascertained. Cannabis use in pregnancy does not increase teratogenicity, stillbirths, or fetal distress, nor does it appear to elicit negative postnatal effects up to 1 year of age.169,176,184,185 One important principle in reviewing the childhood develop- ment data is to look at investigations at different stages of a child’s life because certain cognitive deficits may not be evident, for example, until a child reaches school age. Over time, compensatory mechanisms can result in normalization after a cannabis-induced developmental deficit, followed by other developmental issues that become evident, such as an increased incidence of psychosis in susceptible populations, later in life. These cautions notwithstanding, the evidence for harm is more suggestive than definitive and must be interpreted carefully. Because the endocannabinoid system plays a critical role in neuro- logical development, there is concern that exposure to cannabinoids at critical times of gestational development can cause alterations that can have long-term negative consequences. This seems to be supported by animal data showing that exposure to low doses of THC during prena- tal development can negatively affect cortical development in mice.186

## Child Protection

There is a need to protect young children from accessing cannabis unintentionally. Reports of pediatric ingestion show that drowsiness, lethargy, “coma” that wears off as the effects of cannabis wear off, the need for respiratory intubation, agitation, an inability to walk, vomit- ing, respiratory depression, and aspiration pneumonia are among the most common adverse effects observed.187 The dangers of accidental ingestion should also not be exaggerated because most children unin- tentionally exposed to cannabis recover from symptoms as the effects of cannabis wear off. Unlike opioids, which cause a depression in CNS function that can lead to respiratory failure, cannabis does not have the same effect. Although accidental ingestions do occur and reports to poison control centers increase in incidence in states in the first few years after states enact medical marijuana laws, the overwhelming majority of events resolve without the need for treatment, and relatively few serious events occur.188–190 Even these reports of incidence must be considered carefully because increased reporting of unintentional ingestions does not necessarily mean there are more accidental inges- tions in states where cannabis is legal but can also mean that there is a greater willingness to seek treatment, whereas before legalization, such reports carried a greater threat of childhood endangerment or neglect suspicions that may have caused parents to not seek medical care.


Despite the widespread use of cannabis, including by youth, in the immunocompromised, and in pregnancy, there are no reports of death due to cannabis overdose.41 This is predominantly due to the fact that, unlike opioids, cannabis use does not result in marked depression of respiratory and cardiovascular functions. When overdose does occur, subjects, even experienced users, can feel as if they have died or are at serious risk of dying, which can be very traumatic, and with edibles, this event can last for several hours, but full recovery can be expected. Conversely, there are individual reports of overdose resulting in psy- chotic behavior resulting in death. In at least two cases, edible prepa- rations were implicated. In one, a young inexperienced user consumed a cannabis edible, did not feel as if any effect was occurring, due to the lag time between consumption and effects, and consumed many times the amount that he should have. This resulted in erratic behavior and his throwing himself over a balcony, falling to his death. His blood THC level was reported at 7.3 ng/mL, a little over the legal driving limit of ng/mL. In another case, only a small amount of an edible preparation was eaten along with pain medications, causing a man to act erratically, asking his wife to get his gun and “kill him.” While the wife called 911, the man got his gun and shot her. In the first case, causality appears clear. In the second case, a single case report such as this does not pro- vide the entire picture of what could have contributed to this behavior. However, while on the call, the wife expressed that she had never seen her husband act in that manner and said he was acting more drunk than violent. There was a history of schizophrenia in the man’s family, caus- ing his defense attorneys to suggest he was particularly prone to canna- bis-induced psychosis, a claim that was neither proven nor disproven. There is a single case report of an 11-month-old who died of myocarditis subsequent to cannabis exposure, likely due to an edible preparation. Although causation cannot be assured, the physicians attempted to rule out other causes. Blood THC levels were 7.8 ng/ mL,220 which is very high for an 11-month-old, considering the 5-ng/ mL limit established for adult intoxication. Cannabis also has marked cardiovascular-related effects, with tachycardia being one of the most physiological relevant effects of cannabis intoxication.123 This still does not establish causality, but it is not unreasonable to consider cannabis as a contributing factor to such events. As these reports suggest, the greatest risk of toxicity is with edible preparations because of the delay in onset of effects, and the risk is THC dependent. In contrast, the relatively immediate effects of respi- ratory administration allow consumers to self-regulate, and with the physical incapacitation that occurs in most users, it is very difficult to reach concentrations that would represent toxic overdose events. Despite its relative safety, cannabis does result in reports to poison control centers and visits to emergency rooms, primarily due to dread of death, paranoia, anxiety, or convulsions. Although there are a num- ber of pharmaceutical and mechanical interventions, the best policy is to provide support and reassurance to those suffering from excess cannabis use until the most acute effects wear off. Based on rodent toxicology studies, the equivalent lethal dose of THC in humans has been extrapolated to be more than 15,000 mg or the equivalent of ingesting 7500 g of cannabis that contains 20% THC.41

## 483CHAPTER 61 Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids


The most significant clinically relevant interactions can occur when cannabis is taken with CNS depressant drugs such as sedative-hypnotics or alcohol. THC is metabolized by a number of cytochrome enzymes (CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4) that are involved in the metabolization of the majority of conventional medications. Any substance that inhibits CYP enzymes can increase the bioavailability and action of THC and THC-related adverse effects. Concomitant use of cannabis with tricy- clic antidepressants, amphetamines, and anticholinergic agents (e.g., antihistamines) has resulted in increased heart rate (tachycardia), high blood pressure, drowsiness, and cardiotoxicity. Substances that increase CYP activity can, conversely, potentially decrease the efficacy of can- nabis. Of most clinical significance considering the recent approval of Epidiolex is the potential for interactions with antiseizure medications such as clobazam. CBD has been shown to inhibit the metabolization of this medication, resulting in a positive interaction associated with increases in plasma levels of clobazam metabolites and the ability to maintain seizure control with lower-than-normal clobazam doses. Conversely, CBD has been reported to decrease the anticonvulsive activity of other antiseizure medications. Perhaps the most significant potential benefit of cannabis to date in relationship to other drug use is the reduction in opioid-related fatalities. In those states that enacted medical marijuana laws, a 24.8% reduction in opioid-related fatalities was observed.82 Clinically, the use of cannabis resulted in a 64% reduction in opioid use.81 In contrast, the intoxicating effects of cannabis can sometimes be enhanced with concomitant use of opioids.41

## Gastrointestinal Disorders

Cayenne pepper exerts several beneficial effects on gastrointestinal function, including acting as a digestant and carminative.7 In addition, constituents of capsicum increase gastric emptying; stimulate gas- tromucosal defense and absorption; enhance permeability to micro- nutrients; and stimulate salivary, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic secretions.8 Traditionally, C. annuum has been used against various gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, loss of appetite, gas- trointestinal reflux disease (GERD), and gastric ulcer. Red pepper has been used therapeutically in atonic dyspepsia and flatulence because it increases the motility in the gastric antrum, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and colon.9 Capsicum has been used as an antiseptic, coun- terirritant, appetite suppressor, antioxidant, and immunomodulator in the gastrointestinal system. Double-blind studies show that red pepper consumption protects against aspirin-induced stomach damage and improves epigastric pain, fullness, and nausea scores in people with nonulcer dyspepsia.10–12 In one study, the digestive-enhancing effects of capsicum were deter- mined in 30 patients with functional dyspepsia and without GERD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients randomly received 2.5 g/day of red pepper powder or placebo before meals for 5 weeks in a double-blind manner. Starting from the third week, overall symptom score and epigastric pain, fullness, and nausea scores were significantly lower than the placebo group. The decrease reached about 60% at the end of treatment in the red pepper group, whereas placebo scores decreased by less than 30%. Capsicum does, however, lower the threshold for GERD, presum- ably by direct effects on sensory neurons, and may produce symptoms of GERD.13,14 The therapeutic use of chili pepper and capsaicin may therefore act as a double-edged sword in many physiological circum- stances, and further studies are warranted to determine the dose ceiling for their use as gastroprotective agents.

## Thermogenic Aid

Capsicum ingestion may prove to be helpful in promoting weight loss in obese individuals. The antiobesity effects of capsicum occur via several mechanisms, including thermogenesis, satiety, fat oxidation, elevation of the basal metabolic rate, reduction of caloric intake, pre- vention of adipogenesis, restriction of the activity of lipoprotein lipase and pancreatic lipase, stimulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue, inhi- bition of the differentiation of adipocytes, and modulating adipokine release from adipose tissues.15 A study of 13 Japanese females showed that adding red pepper to high-fat meals increased diet-induced brown adipose tissue thermo- genesis and lipid oxidation.16 In a clinical trial, capsaicinoids from Capsicum were administered to subjects (age 42 years and body mass index [BMI] 30.4) for 12 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/day. At the end of the study, subjects in the treatment group had an average abdominal adi- posity reduction of 21.1% compared with 20.2% in the placebo group, Antioxidant activity Insulin mimetic Weight regulation and hypolipidemic Activation of TRPV1 Stimulation of GLP1 accretion Increasing insulin sensitivity Glucose homeostasis regulation Inhibition of α- glucosidase activity Inhibition of α-amylase activity Anti-β cell apoptotic

and these effects were positively correlated with the change in body weight.17 Researchers have also evaluated the effects of dietary red pepper added to high-fat and high-carbohydrate meals on subsequent feeding behavior and energy intake.18 After ingesting a standardized dinner on the previous evening, the subjects ate one of the following for breakfast: a high-fat meal, a high-fat meal with red pepper (10 g), a high-carbohydrate meal, or a high-carbohydrate meal with red pepper (10 g). The addition of red pepper reduced appetite and hunger before lunch, and diet-induced thermogenesis was significantly enhanced by the addition of red pepper to either meal, but especially the high-fat meal. In another study, 40 women and 40 men (mean age of 42 years and BMI of 30.4) were randomly assigned to a capsinoid (6 mg/day) or placebo group.19 Mean weight change was 0.9 and 0.5 kg in the capsinoid and placebo groups, respectively. There was no significant group difference in total change in adiposity, but abdominal adiposity decreased more in the capsinoid group (−1.11%) than in the placebo group (−0.18%), and this change correlated with the change in body weight. Changes in resting energy expenditure did not differ signifi- cantly between groups, but fat oxidation was higher at the end of the study in the capsinoid group.

## Cardiovascular Disease and the Metabolic Syndrome

Capsicum exerts several effects beneficial in the prevention of cardio- vascular disease, including inhibiting low-density lipoprotein choles- terol oxidation, acting as an antioxidant, inhibiting platelet aggregation, promoting fibrinolysis, and improving arterial function.20 A random- ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on hyperlipidemic subjects ingesting a traditional fermented red pepper paste (kochujang) for 12 weeks demonstrated significant reductions in total cholesterol (215.5 ± 16.1 mg/dL–194.5 ± 25.4 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (133.6 ± 14.8 mg/dL–113.5 ± 23.1 mg/dL) in the kochujang-supplemented group compared with placebo.21 Capsaicin consumption 1 hour before low-intensity exercise is a valuable supplement for the treatment of individuals with hyperlipidemia and/or obesity because it improves lipolysis.22 Besides being cardioprotective, the beneficial hypocho- lesterolemic influence of capsaicin extend to include the prevention of cholesterol gallstones and protection of the structural integrity of erythrocytes under conditions of hypercholesterolemia.23 It is known that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) reduces arte- rial blood pressure. Because administration of capsaicin and isoflavone increases serum levels of IGF-1 by sensory neuron stimulation in sub- jects with alopecia, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of capsaicin and isoflavone on blood pressure in patients with hyperten- sion.24 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum levels of IGF-1 were measured before and at 1, 3, and 5 months after the administra- tion of capsaicin and isoflavone. Although blood pressure was unaf- fected in normotensive subjects, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in hypertensive volunteers after administra- tion of capsaicin and isoflavone, and IGF-1 levels were significantly increased. In healthy human subjects, a single meal with capsaicin caused an increase in postprandial GLP1 concentration while decreasing post- prandial ghrelin concentration.25 Chili consumption also lowers post- prandial hyperinsulinemia.26 In addition to the effects of capsaicin in type 2 diabetes, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 44 pregnant women with gestational diabetes indicated that 5 mg/ dL capsaicin for 4 weeks improved fasting lipid levels, improved post- prandial hyperglycemia, improved hyperinsulinemia, and decreased the incidence of large-for-gestational-age newborns.27 Fig. 62.3 describes several of the known mechanisms associated with the antidi- abetic effects of C. annuum. Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype I (TRPV1) is the receptor for capsaicin and is widely expressed in the brain, sensory nerves, dorsal root ganglia, bladder, gut, and blood vessels.

is involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and pain sensation and likely plays a critical role in the regulation of cardiovascular function and metabolic homeostasis. Activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin has been shown to prevent obesity, improve glucose homeostasis, alleviate hypertension, and antagonize dysfunction of cardiometabolic organs (Fig. 62.4).28 This receptor provides a common link between the con- ditions associated with the metabolic syndrome and may be an optimal target for capsaicin in the treatment and management of cardiometa- bolic diseases.


The preponderance of the data strongly indicates significant anticancer benefits of capsaicin. Capsaicin has been shown to alter the expression of several genes involved in cancer cell survival, growth arrest, angio- genesis, and metastasis. Capsaicin targets multiple signaling pathways, oncogenes, and tumor-suppressor genes in various types of cancer models. In addition, data suggest several benefits of combinational use of capsaicin with other dietary or chemotherapeutic compounds, lead- ing to synergistic anticancer activity. Capsicum has shown an antiproliferative effect on various human cancer cell lines. Capsaicin induced significant cytotoxicity with increases in oxidative stress, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (SNU-1).29 Capsaicin-induced apoptosis in SNU-1 cells was associated with down-regulation of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) mRNA and protein. This is significant because in cells in which tNOX was scarcely affected, capsaicin exhibited lit- tle apoptosis and low cytotoxicity. However, in tNOX-knockdown sensitized cells, capsaicin induced apoptosis and decreased growth, demonstrating that tNOX is essential for cancer cell growth. A simi- lar mechanism was demonstrated in a study of human bladder can- cer cells that indicated that capsaicin inhibits the growth of multiple bladder cancer cell phenotypes by inhibiting tNOX and SIRT1 (a deacetylase important in multiple cellular functions), thereby reduc- ing proliferation, attenuating migration, and prolonging cell-cycle progression.30 The various signaling pathways involved in capsaicin-mediated cellular responses include oxidative stress, which is known to trigger apoptosis. Capsaicin was shown to induce apoptosis in pancreatic can- cer cells in association with a reduction in Complex I and Complex III activity, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial damage.31 The suppression of cyclooxygenase (COX), an ROS-generating enzyme, was shown to be involved in capsa- icin-induced apoptosis of human neuroblastoma cells.32 The plasma membrane–resident NADPH oxidase also responds to capsaicin, and the NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of ROS may be essentially involved in the mechanism of capsaicin-induced apoptosis in human hepatoblastoma cells.33 Other pathways are also relevant to capsaicin-mediated apop- tosis. Caspase activation and nitric oxide (NO) elevation were found to be induced by capsaicin stimulating p53 and the apoptotic Bax expression through Mdm2 down-regulation, thus increasing mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells.34 The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been closely linked with tumorigenesis. Capsaicin was found to inhibit the activation of STAT3 and alter protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin in multiple myeloma cells, demon- strating a potential role in the prevention and treatment of multiple myeloma and other cancers.35 Furthermore, in urothelial carcinoma cells, capsaicin exerts its apoptotic activity through overexpression of TRPV1.36 Fig. 62.5 provides a summary of the apoptotic mechanisms and anticancer activity of capsaicin.

## 488SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

The development of resistance to anticancer drugs is a common clinical issue in the treatment of patients with cancer, and methods to address this complication are continuously sought. One solution is the coadministration of substances (chemosensitizers) that can reverse the resistance to anticancer drugs. Capsaicin not only exhibits apop- totic and preventive properties in cancer, but it has also shown signifi- cant potential as a chemosensitizing agent. Capsaicin significantly and synergistically increases the cytotoxicity of several chemotherapeutic drugs, including but not limited to doxorubicin,37 sorafenib,38 plati- num drugs (e.g., cisplatin),39 and vinblastine.40

# CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR TOPICAL

# PREPARATIONS

Clinical use of cayenne pepper has focused on topical capsaicin-con- taining preparations. Commercial ointments containing 0.025% or 0.075% capsaicin are available over the counter. These preparations may offer significant benefits in many conditions, including pain disorders, diabetic neuropathy, cluster headache, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, topically applied capsaicin may be useful in psoriasis.

## Postherpetic Neuralgia

The first studies and approved use for topically applied capsaicin were in relieving postherpetic neuralgia. Numerous studies now document this U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved application. For example, in one study, 39 patients with chronic postherpetic neu- ralgia (average duration 24 months) were treated with 0.025% capsa- icin cream for 8 weeks.41 During therapy, the patients rated their pain. Nineteen patients (48.7%) substantially improved after the 8-week trial; 5 (12.8%) discontinued therapy due to side effects, such as intol- erable capsaicin-induced burning sensations (4) or mastitis (1); and (38.5%) reported no benefit. The decrease in pain ratings was signifi- cant after 2 weeks of continuous application. Of the responders, 72.2% still reported improvement 10 to 12 months after the study, with most continuing to apply the cream regularly. Higher concentration (0.075% vs. 0.025%) might produce better results (as high as 75% response).42 Capsaicin responders were char- acterized by higher average daily pain, higher allodynia ratings, and relatively preserved sensory function at baseline compared with nonre- sponders.43 In three of the “capsaicin responders,” the area of allodynia expanded into previously nonallodynic and nonpainful skin that had normal sensory function and cutaneous innervation. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted to con- firm the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of NGX-4010, an 8% capsa- icin dermal patch (capsaicin μ g/cm2) in patients with postherpetic neuralgia.44 In this study, 418 patients were randomized to receive a single 60-minute application of NGX-4010 or a 0.04% capsaicin control patch. NGX-4010 recipients had a significantly greater mean reduction from baseline in pain during weeks 2 to 8 compared with the control group (32.0% vs. 24.4%). Pain was significantly lower in the NGX-4010 group by week 2, and greater pain reduction was main- tained throughout the remaining 12-week study period. In a 4-week, double-blind study, patients with postherpetic neuralgia were ran- domized to receive NGX-4010 or a control patch.45 Efficacy was evalu- ated using a numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) scores. During days to 28 after the double-blind treatment, NGX-4010 patients had a mean change in NPRS scores from baseline of –32.7% compared with –4.4% for control patients. Mean changes in NPRS scores from baseline during weeks 2 to 12 was –33.8% for NGX-4010 and +4.9% for control recipients. In both studies, transient increases in application site pain were adequately managed, and no increases in application reactions or adverse events were observed with repeated treatments. Capsaicin 8% patch is an effective, tolerable, and generally safe treatment in cases of postherpetic neuralgia.

## Trigeminal Neuralgia

Topically applied capsaicin may be effective in reducing the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. In one study, 12 patients were followed up for 1 year after the topical application over the painful area of capsaicin 3 times a day for several days.46 Six patients had complete and four patients had partial relief of pain; the remaining two patients had no relief of pain. Of the 10 patients who were responsive to therapy, 4 had relapses of pain within 95 to 149 days. No relapses followed the sec- ond therapy for the remainder of the year. These results are promising for a condition that usually does not respond to any therapy, short of surgery.

## Postmastectomy Pain

Topically applied capsaicin may help in the relief of pain after breast reconstruction or mastectomy. In one double-blind study, 23 patients with postmastectomy pain syndrome applied either capsaicin (0.075%) or vehicle (placebo) only cream 4 times daily for 4 to 6 weeks.47 There was a significant difference in jabbing pain, in category pain severity scales, and in overall pain relief scales in favor of capsaicin. Five of 13 patients on capsaicin were categorized as having good-to-excellent responses, with 8 patients (62%) having 50% or greater improvement. Only 1 of 10 cases had a good response to the vehicle, with 3 rated as 50% or better. In another study, 14 patients with postmastectomy pain had sig- nificant pain relief after application of 0.025% capsaicin cream four times daily for 4 to 6 weeks.48 Unpleasant or painful sensations to light touch or pressure in the painful area (hyperesthesia, allodynia) were also improved.

## Mouth Pain Due to Chemotherapy or Radiation

In a study conducted at the Yale Pain Management Center, capsaicin was shown to dramatically reduce the pain from mouth sores result- ing from chemotherapy or radiation treatment.49 An interesting fea- ture in this study was the vehicle used to deliver the capsaicin—taffy. The researchers chose taffy because it could be held in the mouth long enough to desensitize the neurons. The sugar decreased the initial burning sensation, and its soft edges would not aggravate sore mouths like a hard candy. All 11 patients in the Yale study had decreased pain, and in 2 cases the pain stopped entirely after eating the capsaicin-laced candy.

## Diabetic Neuropathy

Topically applied capsaicin has been shown to be of considerable benefit in relieving the pain of diabetic neuropathy in numerous double-blind studies.50–55 In one large double-blind, 8-week study, investigators at 12 sites enrolled 277 men and women with painful dia- betic neuropathy of the hands and feet.56 69.5% of the group applying the capsaicin cream (0.075%) showed improvement compared with 53.4% in those applying only the vehicle cream. In another study, 40 patients applied either 0.075% capsaicin cream or placebo to their affected extremities daily. After 4 weeks, 76% of treated patients had some pain relief compared with 50% of placebo patients. In addition, those responding to capsaicin had a 50% reduc- tion in pain, whereas those in the placebo group averaged between 15% and 20% relief in pain symptoms. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of an 8% capsaicin patch versus pla- cebo in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.57 In this

study, 369 patients were randomized to one 30-minute treatment with either capsaicin 8% patch or placebo to painful areas of the feet. The change in average daily pain score from baseline to between weeks through 8 was statistically significant for the capsaicin patch versus placebo (–27.4% vs. –20.9%). In addition, patients treated with capsa- icin 8% patch had a shorter median time to treatment response (19 vs. 72 days) and modest improvements in sleep interference scores com- pared with placebo. Results confirm the clinical utility of the capsaicin 8% patch in the diabetic population.

## Nondiabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

Multiple studies have demonstrated the capsaicin 8% patch is an effective treatment option in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) arising from different etiologies. The capsaicin 8% patch provides rapid and sustained pain reductions in patients with PNP and a significant reduction in prescribed concomitant neuropathic pain medications. In nondiabetic patients with PNP, an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial demonstrated the capsaicin 8% patch provided noninferior pain relief versus pregabalin, with a more rapid onset of pain relief and fewer systemic side effects.58 A 12-week, non- interventional study of a single capsaicin 8% patch treatment demon- strated effectiveness for preexisting PNP and suggested that early initiation of topical treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) may benefit patients to a greater extent than patients with a longer his- tory of pain.59 A prospective, open-label, observational safety study in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, posttraumatic or postsurgical nerve injury, HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy, or other peripheral neuropathic pain concluded that capsaicin 8% patch repeat treatment over 52 weeks was well tolerated, with variable alteration in sensory function (newly emergent hyperesthesia or allodynia apparent in 1.1%–3.6% of cases) and minimal chance of complete sensory loss.60 ASCEND was an open-label, noninterventional study of patients with nondiabetes-related PNP who received capsaicin 8% patch treat- ment and were followed for ≤ 52 weeks.61 Following the first treatment with the capsaicin 8% patch, there was an overall 26.6% reduction in mean NPRS “average pain” score from baseline to weeks 2 and 8. Overall, patients had a 24.5% reduction in their mean NPRS score from baseline to week 2 and a 37.0% reduction to week 52. A total of 44.4% and 26.2% of patients were classified as ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% responders, respectively, after the first treatment. Of responders at week 8, 86.9% retained responder status at week 12 after the first treatment. Patients had a median time from the first to second treatment of 191 days and a median time from the second to third treatment of 301 days. Together, these studies confirm that the capsaicin 8% patch pro- vides consistent pain relief in a broad range of PNP etiologies. A mul- ticenter, randomized, semidouble-blind study indicated that 0.625% capsaicin patch may prove to be an effective and safe alternative with which to treat patients with PNP and could replace the high-concen- tration (8%) patch.62 However, further studies are needed to defini- tively establish efficacy.

## Cluster Headaches

Several studies found that intranasal application of capsaicin ointment by a physician might relieve cluster headaches. In one double-blind study, patients with acute cluster headaches were randomized to receive either capsaicin or placebo in the nostril for 7 days.63 Patients recorded the severity of each headache for 15 days. Headaches on days 8 to 15 of the study were significantly less severe in the capsaicin group versus the placebo group. There was also a significant decrease in head- ache severity in the capsaicin group on days 8 to 15 compared with days 1 to 7. Episodic patients appeared to benefit more than chronic patients.

## Arthritis

Topically applied capsaicin may be effective in relieving the pain of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. One study showed it to be more effective in osteoarthritis, whereas another study showed more benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In the double-blind study showing more effect in osteoarthritis, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 14 patients with osteoarthri- tis who had painful involvement of the hands applied either capsaicin 0.075% or vehicle-only cream to the hands four times daily. Capsaicin reduced tenderness and pain associated with osteoarthritis but not rheumatoid arthritis.64 In the study showing greater benefit for rheumatoid arthritis, 70 patients with osteoarthritis and 31 with rheumatoid arthri- tis received capsaicin or placebo for 4 weeks.65 The patients were instructed to apply 0.025% capsaicin cream or its vehicle (placebo) to painful knees four times daily. Significantly more relief of pain was reported by the capsaicin-treated patients than the placebo patients throughout the study; after 4 weeks of capsaicin treatment, patients with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis demonstrated mean reductions in pain of 57% and 33%, respectively. These reductions in pain were statistically significant compared with those reported with placebo. According to overall evaluations, 80% of the capsa- icin-treated patients experienced a reduction in pain after 2 weeks of treatment.

## Psoriasis

Excessive substance P levels in the skin have been linked to psoria- sis. This finding prompted researchers to study the effects of topically applied capsaicin. In one double-blind study, 44 patients with sym- metrically distributed psoriasis lesions applied topical capsaicin to one side of their body and a placebo to the other side.66 After 3 to 6 weeks, significantly greater reductions in scaling and redness were observed on the capsaicin side. Burning, stinging, itching, and skin redness were noted by nearly half of the patients initially, but these diminished or vanished upon continued application. In a later study, 197 patients applied capsaicin 0.025% cream or placebo cream 4 times a day for 6 weeks.67 Efficacy was based on a phy- sician’s evaluation and a combined psoriasis severity score, including scaling, thickness, erythema, and pruritus. Capsaicin-treated patients demonstrated significantly greater improvement at the physician’s evaluation and in pruritus relief, as well as a significantly greater reduc- tion in combined psoriasis severity.

## Pruritus Ani

Pruritus ani is a common condition that can be difficult to treat. Results from a double-blind study indicated that capsaicin was a safe and highly effective treatment for severe, intractable idiopathic pruritus ani.68 This study involved two 4-week treatment phases separated by a 1-week washout phase. Forty-four patients were ran- domized to receive locally either active capsaicin (0.006%) or pla- cebo (menthol 1%) ointment over a 4-week period. After 4 weeks of treatment and a 1-week washout period, the placebo group began to receive capsaicin, whereas the treated group received placebo (menthol 1%), for another 4 weeks. At the end of the controlled study, responders from both groups continued with capsaicin treatment in an open-label manner. Results indicated that 31 of patients experienced relief during capsaicin treatment periods and did not respond to menthol; all patients who did not respond to capsaicin also did not respond to menthol. In 13 patients, treatment with capsaicin was unsuccessful: 8 patients did not respond to cap- saicin treatment, 1 responded equally to capsaicin and placebo, and 4 others dropped out because of side effects.

## 490SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


Cayenne pepper can be used liberally in the diet. Creams containing 0.025% or 0.075% capsaicin or poultices can be applied to affected areas up to four times daily.


Capsicum is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Contraindications to oral ingestion include aggrava- tion or appearance of GERD or other sensitivity. Studies showed that consumption of 3 g of red chilies per day during the postoperative period after hemorrhoidectomy or surgery for anal fissures increased the intensity of typical postoperative symptoms, stool frequency, and the consumption of analgesics.69,70 Topically applied capsaicin may produce a local burning sensation; however, this effect goes away with time and rarely is severe enough to warrant discontinuation of use of the cream.


Although several theoretical interactions have been postulated, no clinical cases have been documented. The use of capsicum has been cautioned in patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy.

## Pharmacokinetics

The heart and skeletal muscles, as well as many other tissues, depend primarily on fatty acid oxidation as a source of energy. Because they cannot synthesize carnitine, its transport into these tissues is of critical importance. Specific carnitine-binding transport proteins were identified for several tissues (e.g., cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, epididymis, liver, kidney) taking the serum carnitine into the cell.1,3 Through this active transport mechanism, the tissues can concentrate carnitine up to times greater than the concentration found in plasma. A small in vivo study measured the pharmacokinetics of carnitine in Chinese men and women participants. A 2000-mg single oral dose of l-carnitine (LC; Fig. 63.3) had a half-life of approximately 60.3 hours compared with l-acetylcarnitine (LAC) at 35.9 hours and l-propionyl- carnitine (LPC) at 25.7 hours. The maximum plasma concentration of LC, LAC, and LPC occurred at 3.4, 2.4, and 3.8 hours after ingestion, respectively, and at quantities of 84.7, 12.9, and 5.1 μ mol/L, respec- tively. The researchers found comparable levels of carnitine absorp- tion and metabolism between men and women, suggesting that gender should not affect dosage.7 Urinary excretion of unchanged carnitine is the major route of elimination of carnitine. Because the tubular reabsorption of carnitine by the kidneys is extremely efficient, the daily turnover of carnitine is estimated to be only 4% to 6% of the total body pool of the healthy individual.1–3,7 Factors that increase carnitine excretion and degrada- tion are discussed later in the section on deficiency.

# PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS

Carnitine’s basic function is in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix and the facilitation of β -oxidation.1,3 Because acyl-coenzyme A formed in the endoplasmic reticulum or outer mitochondrial membrane cannot penetrate the inner mitochondrial membrane to the site of fatty acid β -oxidation, the acyl group must be transferred from coenzyme A to carnitine. The acyl-carnitine molecule then transports the fatty acid molecule to the mitochondrial surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane and releases the fatty acid into the matrix, where β -oxidation occurs. Fig. 63.4 summarizes this process. Carnitine has several other physiological functions, including oxi- dation of the ketoacid analogs of the branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine.1–3 This function is extremely important during fasting, starvation, and exercise.

# DEFICIENCY

Carnitine deficiency may arise from several causes, as listed in Box 63.1. Carnitine deficiency states have been classified into two major groups: • Systemic carnitine deficiency • Myopathic deficiency Diagnosis of systemic carnitine deficiency can be made using serum or 24-hour urine samples. Total, free, and esterified carnitine levels should be determined. In myopathic carnitine deficiency, diagnosis requires skeletal muscle biopsy.8 O H 3 C CH 3 OH CHCO−N+ CH 3 CH 2 CH 2

## 493CHAPTER 63 Carnitine

Until the late 1990s, there were no documented reports of patients with primary systemic carnitine deficiency. The systemic deficiency has always been secondary to some other factor rather than a defect in car- nitine synthesis.1–3,8,9 However, mutations in the organic cation/carni- tine transporter gene (OCTN2) were identified in an infant. The infant presented with Reye-like symptoms including encephalopathy, hypoke- totic hypoglycemia, elevated liver enzymes, and steatosis. Treatment with intravenous carnitine and then oral LC (200 mg/kg/day) produced a rapid recovery.10 There are at least a half dozen more papers since then referenc- ing the OCTN2 gene mutation producing primary carnitine deficiency. The consequences of systemic carnitine deficiency are impaired lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscles, myocardium, and liver. Progressive muscle weakness with lipid storage myopathy is found in all patients.1–3,8 In adults, auxiliary nonmitochondrial oxidation mechanisms are apparently stimulated, resulting in some degree of adapta- tion. This adaptation occurs in starvation, diabetes, high-fat diets, and other causes of secondary carnitine deficiency. Systemic carnitine deficiencies usually respond dramatically to orally administered supplemental LC.8,9 Children are apparently unable to adapt to low carnitine levels as well as adults can.8 Several cases of carnitine deficiency in children, presenting a clinical picture resembling Reye’s syndrome (acute encephalopathy associated with altered liver function due to lipid accumulation), have been reported.9,11,12 The clinical presentation of secondary carnitine deficiency in chil- dren includes hypotonia, failure to thrive, recurrent infections, enceph- alopathy, nonketotic hypoglycemia, and cardiomyopathy.8 Several fatal cases of systemic carnitine deficiency have been reported.9,13 In primary myopathic carnitine deficiency, there is an inborn error of carnitine metabolism that is limited to skeletal muscle.8,9 The defect appears to be in the transport of carnitine into the skeletal muscle as serum carnitine; the carnitine levels in other tissues are normal. Severe lipid storage myopathy is the result. Supplemental carnitine is gener- ally of no value in myopathic carnitine deficiency. Rather, improve- ments have been noted using diets high in medium-chain triglycerides and low in long-chain triglycerides.8

# CARNITINE AS A NUTRIENT

Analysis of several hundred foods for carnitine content indicates that meat and dairy products are the major dietary sources of carnitine.3 In general, the redder the meat, the higher the carnitine content. Cereals, fruits, and vegetables contain little or no carnitine. Preliminary studies indicate that the daily diet contains 5 to 100 mg of carnitine.3 There is no evidence that a vegetarian or vegan diet promotes deficiency and would need supplementation. As long as the liver and kidney are able to synthesize carnitine from lysine and methionine, deficiency of car- nitine typically does not occur.

## Carnitine in the Infant Diet

Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, which requires carnitine, is well known to be critical to the survival and normal development of the newborn.3 Carnitine concentrations in fetal and umbilical cord blood are higher than in maternal blood, suggesting the placenta may actively transport carnitine to the fetus because carnitine synthesis is not fully developed.3 The initial carnitine concentration in the newborn depends on maternal carnitine concentration. Supplementation of carnitine during pregnancy may be necessary to ensure adequate tissue concentrations in the fetus, as well as the mother. Serum carnitine levels are typically lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women, presumably due to increased excretion.14,15 The newborn infant is almost entirely dependent on external sources of carnitine.3 Breastfed infants have the best chance of achiev- ing optimal carnitine concentrations. The bioavailability of carnitine from breast milk is significantly greater than that in cow’s milk–based formulas,16 and soy-based infant formulas contain no detectable car- nitine.3 Formula feeding may necessitate supplemental carnitine to achieve normal carnitine concentrations in these infants. Carnitine administration to preterm infants has potentiated weight gain and growth.17 In preterm infants, serum values of carnitine decrease dramatically due to limited storage capacity coupled with a decreased ability to synthesize carnitine. Administration of LC to preterm infants is considered important.


Many disease states, in addition to classic as well as secondary carnitine deficiency, may benefit from carnitine administration. Evidence sup- ports the assertion that supplemental carnitine may benefit the condi- tions listed in Box 63.2 and discussed later. Carnitine is available in several different forms. The form being used must be LC alone or bound to either acetic (LAC) or propionic acid (LPC). The d form of carnitine (discussed later in the section on “Toxicology”) should never be used. The reason for using carnitine will dictate the form used. For Alzheimer’s disease and brain and neurological effects, it appears that LAC may provide the greatest benefit. For angina, ulcerative colitis, and wound healing, LPC may be the best choice because the myocardium appears to prefer it to LAC, followed by LC.18,19


Normal heart function is critically dependent on adequate concentra- tions of carnitine. A deficiency of carnitine in the heart would be simi- lar to trying to run an automobile without a fuel pump. Despite plenty of fuel, there is no way to get it to the engine. Although the normal heart stores more carnitine than it needs, if the heart does not have a good supply of oxygen, carnitine levels quickly decrease. This lack of oxygen leads to decreased energy production in the heart and increased risk for angina and heart disease. Oral LAC therapy (1 g twice daily) for 6 months showed a gradual but significant decrease in blood pressure in insulin-resistant participants who had higher risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and/or family history of diabetes type 2). In the patients with greater insulin resistance, the insulin sensitivity was significantly increased. The overall adiponectin values increased. These benefits were slowly reversed during an 8-week follow-up after LAC dis- continuation. There were no changes to participants’ diet or lifestyle during this study. LAC was well tolerated in all participants.20 It appears that LAC can improve aspects that are characteristic of metabolic syn- drome, but without lifestyle and dietary modifications, the patient may potentially need long-term supplementation with carnitine. Carnitine exerts a beneficial effect on blood lipids by lowering tri- glycerides (TGs) and total cholesterol levels while raising high-density

lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). After 4 months of therapy with LC in patients with elevated blood lipids, typical changes observed were a 20% reduction for total cholesterol, a 28% decrease in TGs, and a 12% increase in HDL levels.21,22 Due to the higher cost of carnitine com- pared with other natural agents (e.g., inositol hexaniacinate, garlic, berberine, and guggulipid), its use should be reserved for those cases unresponsive to these more cost-effective measures. A study comparing LC (2 grams/day) with simvastatin (20mg/day) or simvastatin alone was conducted on patients with hyperlipidemia and elevated lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) levels. The results showed a sig- nificant reduction in Lp(a) with the combined therapy (LC + statin) versus simvastatin monotherapy. Both treatment groups lowered total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipopro- tein B, and TGs significantly.23

## Angina and Recovery From Myocardial Infarction

Carnitine is useful in angina due to its ability to improve oxygen usage and energy metabolism by the myocardium. As a result of improving fatty acid usage and energy production, carnitine also prevents the production of toxic fatty acid metabolites.24 These compounds are extremely damaging because they disrupt cellular membranes. Changes in the properties of cell membranes throughout the heart are thought to contribute to impaired contraction of the heart muscle, increased susceptibility to irregular beats, and eventual death of heart tissue. Supplementing with carnitine increases heart carnitine levels and has been shown to prevent the production of toxic fatty acid metabolites, as well as boost antioxidant enzyme levels. In addition to angina, all of these effects make carnitine beneficial in recovery from a heart attack, cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.25,26 Numerous clinical trials demonstrated that carnitine improves angina and heart disease (note that all three commercial forms have been used).25,27–34 Improvements were noted in exercise tolerance and heart function. The results indicated that carnitine is an effective alter- native to drugs in cases of angina. LPC may offer the greatest benefit in angina, as well as in other cardiovascular conditions. LPC is taken up by myocardial cells much more rapidly than other forms of carnitine.18 In one study, LPC (15 mg/kg intravenously) significantly diminished myocardial ischemia as demonstrated by a significant 12% and 50% reduction in ST-segment depression and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, respectively, during the atrial pacing test.35 Left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 18%. Recovery of heart function after exercise occurred much quicker in the LPC group compared with the placebo group. LC and LAC also showed good results. In one of the larger stud- ies, 200 patients with exercise-induced stable angina received either standard therapy alone (e.g., nitroglycerin, calcium channel block- ers, β -blockers, antihypertensives, diuretics, digitalis, antiarrhyth- mics, anticoagulants, hypolipidemics) or in combination with mg/day of LC over a 6-month period.36 Compared with the control group, the patients on LC exhibited a significant reduction in pre- mature ventricular contractions at rest, as well as an increased tol- erance to exercise as demonstrated by an increased maximal cardiac frequency, increased maximal systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and reduced ST-segment depression (70% reduction in the LC group versus no change in the control group). Reductions in LDL-c (8%) and TGs (12%) were also noted. These results are highly significant and provide a strong rationale for the inclusion of carnitine in patients using standard medical therapy. In Italy, a large study involving 472 patients showed additional ben- efits.37 The study was performed to evaluate the effects of LC admin- istration on chronic left ventricular dilation in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. Placebo or LC was given at a dose of g/day intravenously for the first 5 days and then 6 g/day orally for the next 12 months. Left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were evaluated on admission, at discharge from hospital, and at 3, 6, and months after acute myocardial infarction. A significant attenuation of left ventricular dilation in the first year after acute myocardial infarc- tion was observed in patients treated with LC compared with those receiving placebo. The percent increase in both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes from admission to 3-, 6-, and 12-month evalua- tion was significantly reduced in the LC group.

## Congestive Heart Failure

Several double-blind clinical studies showed that carnitine (again, LPC appeared to be more effective than LC or LAC) improved cardiac func- tion in patients with congestive heart failure.25,38,39 In one double-blind study of LPC versus placebo in a group of 60 patients with mild to moderate (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II and III) congestive heart failure, LPC produced demonstrable benefit.38 The group was made up of men and women between 48 and 73 years old

receiving long-term treatment with digitalis and diuretics for at least 3 months and who still displayed symptoms. Thirty of these patients were chosen randomly and for 180 days received 500 mg of LPC three times a day in addition to their usual treatment. At basal conditions and after 30, 90, and 180 days, the maximum exercise time was eval- uated using an exercise tolerance test performed on an ergometer bicycle, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was tested by echocar- diography. After 1 month of treatment, the patients treated with LPC, compared with the control group, showed significant increases in the values of both tests, increases that became even more evident after and 180 days. At the stated times, the increases in the maximum exer- cise time were 16.4%, 22.9%, and 25.9%, respectively. The ventricular ejection fraction increased by 8.4%, 11.6%, and 13.6%, respectively. Even more obvious benefits were seen in a 3-year study of patients with moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III to IV) caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. After a period of stable car- diac function of up to 3 months, patients were randomly assigned to receive either carnitine (2 g/day orally) or placebo. After a mean of 33.7 months of follow-up (range 10–54 months), 70 patients remained in the study: 33 in the placebo group and 37 in the carnitine group. At the time of analysis, 63 patients were alive. Six deaths occurred in the placebo group, and one death in the carnitine group. Survival analysis showed that patients’ survival was statistically significant in favor of the carnitine group.40

## Peripheral Vascular Disease

All three forms of carnitine (2–4 g/day) were shown to improve the walking distance without pain in patients with intermittent claudica- tion. Presumably this improvement was the result of improved energy metabolism within the muscle because carnitine was not shown to improve blood flow to the calf. LPC appeared to offer better effects than either LC or LAC.41,42 However, in one double-blind study, LC at a dosage of 2 g twice daily demonstrated a 75% increase in walking distance after only 3 weeks of therapy.43 In the largest study with LPC, 485 patients with intermittent clau- dication were randomized to placebo or LPC (2 g/day) for 12 months. Maximal walking distance increased by 62% on LPC and by 46% on placebo in all patients. However, when only those patients with more severe disease status were analyzed, the maximal walking distance increased by 98% in the LPC group compared with only 54% in the placebo group.44

## Enhancing Physical Performance and Relieving Fatigue

The ability to enhance exercise tolerance and physical performance with carnitine may not be limited to patients with cardiovascular dis- ease because carnitine supplementation was also shown to be of benefit in healthy subjects and athletes. Efficient use of fatty acids by skeletal muscle, like the myocardium, also depends on an adequate supply of carnitine. Carnitine supplementation (usually 2 g two to three times daily) resulted in significant improvements in cardiovascular function in response to exercise in several double-blind studies in both athletes and normal subjects.45–47 Compared with control groups, the subjects on carnitine showed not only improvements in exercise intensity over time but also evidence of improved energy metabolism within the muscle (lowered blood lactic acid and free fatty acid levels). Obviously, the improved production of energy by the exercising muscle, as well as improved heart function, could be responsible for carnitine’s ability to enhance physical performance. Although at least three studies showed the benefits of carnitine on exercise performance to be of no more value than a placebo, carni- tine supplementation should still be viewed as beneficial, especially in endurance-related events.48–50 The reason behind this statement is the fact that studies demonstrated that carnitine improves energy-produc- ing enzyme levels in long-distance runners.51 These athletes received either a placebo or 2 g of LC twice daily for 4 weeks. Runners receiving LC showed a significant increase in enzymes involved in energy pro- duction (cytochrome C reductase and cytochrome oxidase). In con- trast, there were no changes in the placebo group. One study examined the influence of l-carnitine l-tartrate (LCLT) at a dosage of 2 g/day for 3 weeks on markers of purine catabolism, free radical formation, and muscle tissue disruption after squat exercise. Exercise-induced increases in plasma markers of purine catabolism (hypoxanthine, xanthine oxidase, and serum uric acid) and circu- lating cytosolic proteins (myoglobin, fatty acid-binding protein, and creatine kinase) were significantly reduced by LCLT supplementation. Exercise-induced increases in plasma malondialdehyde returned to resting values sooner during LCLT therapy compared with placebo. The amount of muscle disruption from magnetic resonance imaging scans during LCLT was 41% to 45% of the placebo area. These data indicated that LCLT supplementation was effective in assisting recov- ery from exercise.52 Interestingly, normal subjects taking carnitine have improved car- diovascular function and a more rapid return of heart rate to the rest- ing rate after exercise.53 The significance of these improvements is that carnitine apparently mimics the benefits in heart and vascular function produced by regular exercise training without working up a sweat. Carnitine supplementation appeared to be beneficial in elderly subjects complaining of muscle fatigue.54,55 In one double-blind study, 84 elderly subjects with onset of fatigue after even the slightest phys- ical activity were randomized to receive carnitine 2 g twice daily or a placebo for 30 days. Fatigue scores decreased significantly by 40% (physical) and 45% (mental) in subjects taking carnitine, compared with 11% and 8%, respectively, in the placebo group. Other param- eters improved significantly, including total fat mass, total muscle mass, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, TGs, apoli- poprotein-A1, and apolipoprotein-B.54 In a similar study, researchers reported 2 g/day of LC given to centenarians had a comparable trend when looking at similar parameters.55 The difference was 2 g twice daily showed greater improvement in most parameters measured. Few clinical trials have been published regarding carnitine and fatigue relief in multiple sclerosis patients. Some studies reported sig- nificant benefit,56,57 whereas another suggested better designed studies were needed to determine efficacy.58 Because LC is well tolerated, it may be beneficial to try.

## Cancer-Related Fatigue

A notable percentage of cancer patients are deficient in carnitine (serum total and free carnitine levels). Researchers have given a wide dosage range of LC and measured subjective results of fatigue with mixed results.59–63 An open-label, Phase I/II clinical trial of LC supplementation in carnitine deficient patients with advanced cancer was done. The results showed significant improvement in free carnitine levels. There were 27 patients and 7 treatment groups (250 mg/d, 750 mg/d, 1250 mg/d, 1750 mg/d, 2250 mg/d, 2750 mg/d, and 3000 mg/d) for 7 days. After the trial, all patients but two requested to continue treatment. The results showed “most of the patients who received LC experienced reduced fatigue and improved mood and sleep. The improvement in fatigue was dose dependent within the subgroup that received 7 days of supplementation and experienced a rise in carnitine-associated lab- oratory values.”60 A small 2018 study used 500 mg three time daily for 8 weeks in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. There was improved

general fatigue in all cancer patients, and LC possibly improved the ability of cancer patient to cope with chemotherapy. Also, LC seemed to maintain the plasma levels and lymphocyte counts during chemo- therapy, enabling patients to continue chemotherapy without dosage reduction.63 Another small study of LC supplementation in patients with advanced cancer and carnitine deficiency found no significant change in fatigue after 2 weeks. The patients were given a titrating dosage of LC (500 mg/day for 2 days, then 1 g/day for 2 days, then 2 g/day for 10 days). All carnitine deficiency normalized. The patients were then included in another 2-week open-label phase, and the patients who started the LC supplementation group reported significant improve- ment in fatigue, functional well-being, and performance status com- pared with the original placebo patients. Also, after the trial was over, 12 of 17 patients requested to stay on carnitine.61

## Celiac Disease

Celiac disease can be considered a secondary cause of carnitine defi- ciency due to the characteristic malabsorption component.64 In a small double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n = 47), tests were performed on participants with newly diagnosed celiac disease before and after 6 months of either a gluten-free diet (placebo) or a gluten-free diet plus LC (1 g twice daily; treatment group). Serum carnitine levels were significantly improved from baseline in both groups after implement- ing a gluten-free diet. In the treatment group, serum levels were com- parable to the nonceliac control group. The LC group had significant improvement in fatigue compared with the placebo group as measured by the visual analog scale. The measurement of OCTN2 (cell mem- brane transport protein with strong specificity for carnitine) by intes- tinal biopsies increased by 83% in all celiac patients on a gluten-free diet; however, the amount was still significantly less than that in the nonceliac controls.65 Even with asymptomatic celiac disease, the individual breakdown of the serum carnitine esters may be significantly decreased, with LAC sometimes decreased by 50% to 80%.66

## Ulcerative Colitis

Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) showed similar levels of plasma LC compared with healthy controls; however, the levels of LPC were significantly lower.66 Because short-chain fatty acids are the major fuel substrate for enterocytes and are theorized to be less available in UC, LPC has been studied as a potential treatment.68–70 One study of 10 males with mild UC used LPC enemas (6 g in mL saline solution) twice daily for 14 days. Each enema took 120 min- utes. Significant improvement was noted in all patients, both symp- tom-wise (abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or mucus or blood in stool) and histologically (mucosal erosions, distortion of crypt architecture, epithelium inflammation, and interstitial inflammation). No adverse side effects were reported.68 In a multicenter, Phase II, double-blind, parallel-group trial of mild to moderate UC, patients using stable oral aminosalicylate or thiopu- rine therapy were also given oral LPC for 14 days. The group receiv- ing 500 mg twice daily (1 hour before breakfast and dinner) produced the best effect. Seventy-five percent of patients saw improvement, and 55% had remission of disease, with the majority having mild UC.69 A 2014 study used patients from the latter study to perform micro- scopical analysis of intestinal biopsies before PLC and after 4 weeks. The results showed a reduction of intestinal acute and chronic inflam- mation and amelioration of the damaged microvascular endothelium. The higher oxidative stress in UC was presumably from the intestinal microvascular endothelial dysfunction. The antioxidant effect of LPC mediates the reduction of inflammation.70

## Thyroid Disease

l-carnitine’s effect on thyroid hormone and its benefit in hyperthy- roidism are reported in the literature as early as 1966 by Gilgore and De Felice.71,72 Since 1966, more researchers studied the benefit of LC on hyper- thyroidism, regardless of the cause.71–78 According to researchers, LC does not affect the thyroid gland itself; its action takes place in the peripheral cells. It inhibits thyroid hormone entry into the cell nucleus.73,78 This may explain why patient symptoms (palpitations, tremors, nervousness, etc.) improve significantly, but the blood levels continue to be elevated. Dosages of oral LC ranged from 500 to mg daily. In one study of 19 patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism (thy- roid-stimulating hormone [TSH] = 0.1–0.4 mIU/L and positive anti- bodies), subjects took a combined daily oral dosage of 500 mg LC and 83 mcg selenium for 1 month. The results showed a drop in the score on a 9-item symptom scale from 25.61 ± 1.19 to 12.11 ± 1.15. The symptoms most improved included palpitations, tremor, and nervous- ness. However, after discontinuing the therapy, the symptom score increased to 23.33 ± 1.35 after 1 month. There were no significant changes in the TSH, free T3, or free T4 values throughout the study. The thyroid antibodies (TgAb and TPO Ab) had a drop of at least points after 1 month of treatment and returned to pretreatment levels after discontinuing the treatment.77 l-carnitine prevented and reversed liver enzyme (alkaline phos- phatase [ALP], aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT]) damage produced by the elevated thyroid hormone.75 l-carnitine was administered intravenously (75 mg/kg/d) to an 80-year-old man for severe hyperthyroidism with coma, induced by amiodarone. His Glasgow score was 8. The patient fully recovered hours after starting intravenous (IV) LC administration. Even though he was asymptomatic, the thyroid profile was still classified as hyper- thyroid. l-carnitine was administered for 2 months along with prop- ylthiouracil and avlocardyl. The major improvement occurred when LC was administered.76 In another case report, a 24-year-old male was given 1 g of LC orally every 12 hours and low-dose methimazole (10–15 mg/d) for a thyroid storm. The LC reversed and prevented his hyperthyroid symptoms. While on the LC and methimazole, he had two more thyroid storms, which were preceded by triggering factors (influ- enza, emotional stress). Therefore it seems that LC does not prevent relapses of thyrotoxicosis. However, the second and third storms were clinically milder. The LC and methimazole were stopped months after his third thyroid storm, and the patient was still euthy- roid 10 months later.74

## Alzheimer’s Disease, Senile Depression, and

## Age-Related Memory Defect

Much research has been conducted over the past 20 years with LAC in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, senile depression, and age-related memory defects. As described previously, LAC is a molecule composed of acetic acid and LC bound together. This reaction occurs naturally in the human brain; therefore it is not exactly known how much greater an effect is noted with LAC versus LC or LPC. However, LAC is thought to be substantially more active than these other forms of carnitine in conditions involving the brain.79,80 LAC is structurally related to acetylcholine, a major neurotransmit- ter responsible for memory and proper brain function. In Alzheimer’s disease and, to a lesser extent, the normal aging human brain, there is a defect in the use of acetylcholine. The close structural similarity between LAC and acetylcholine led researchers to begin testing LAC in Alzheimer’s disease. The results have been encouraging.

## 497CHAPTER 63 Carnitine

Researchers showed that LAC does mimic acetylcholine and is of benefit not only in patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease but also in elderly patients who are depressed or who have impaired mem- ory.80 It has also been shown to act as a powerful antioxidant within the brain cell by stabilizing cell membranes, improving energy produc- tion within the brain cell, and enhancing or mimicking the function of acetylcholine.81 In 2008, a study done on rats revealed a significant increase in the brain tissue’s kinesin light-chain 1 gene expression with LAC administration. When the kinesin light-chain 1 gene was down- regulated, amyloid deposition was accelerated.82 The results in delaying the progression of Alzheimer’s disease have been promising. The studies have been well controlled and extremely thorough.79,83–85 Memory impairment need not be as severe as in Alzheimer’s dis- ease for LAC to demonstrate benefit.86–88 In one double-blind study of 236 elderly subjects with mild mental deterioration, as evidenced by detailed clinical assessment, the group receiving 1500 mg of LAC daily demonstrated significant improvement in mental function, par- ticularly in memory and constructional thinking.88 Many of the elderly have depression not only as a result of experiencing a great deal of loss in their lives but also because of the biochemical changes in the brain associated with aging. LAC was shown to improve depression in elderly subjects in double-blind studies using assessment scales standard to scientific research of antidepressant drugs (e.g., Hamilton Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impression, Sandoz Clinical Assessment). The usual dosage was 500 mg three times daily but has been researched as high as 3 g daily.89–91 Elderly subjects with the highest depression scores were usually the ones who benefited the most from LAC.89,91 LAC also appears helpful in enhancing the effects of acetylcho- linesterase inhibitors. In one open study of oral LAC (2 g/day for months), 23 patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (unresponsive to donepezil or rivastigmine alone) showed an increased response rate with LAC treatment as an addition to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (38% vs. 50%, respectively). The response rate was a measurement of cognitive function, functional status, and behavioral symptoms.92 This additive effect may be useful whenever a patient does not respond to either treatment alone.


Recently, animal studies examined the antidepressive activity of LAC.93,94 LAC was shown to preserve brain plasticity in chronic restraint stress and to grow primary and secondary dendrites. Also, after LAC treatment, “dendrites of the medial amygdala stellate neu- rons were more complex and longer compared with the chronic restraint stress group that received just the vehicle.” Behaviorally, LAC appears to enhance resilience to stress by reducing passive behavior and increasing the social interaction ratio in the social avoidance test. There was no change in behavior in nonstressed animals receiving LAC.93 A mouse model showed that LAC had an effect on the type metabotropic glutamate receptors and improved depression symp- toms within 3 days of daily dosing. No tolerance to dosage was seen by 21 days. The benefit from LAC lasted 2 weeks after discontinuation.94 There are many other theories as to the mechanism of action of LAC and depression. A thorough review can be found in Chiechio’s review article.95 In general, LAC seems to work as well as classic anti- depressants, but in less time and without the adverse events. It was also reported that LAC is more effective in the older population compared with younger patients.95

## Down Syndrome

Given that both Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease are characterized by a deficit in cholinergic transmission, a study was conducted to assess the effect of a 90-day treatment with LAC in individuals with Down syndrome.96 Treated patients with Down syn- drome showed statistically significant improvements in visual mem- ory and attention, both in absolute terms and in comparison with the other groups. No improvement was found in mentally deficient non–Down syndrome subjects, so the favorable effect of LAC appears to be specific for patients with Down syndrome. An effective dosage is 20 mg of LAC per 2 lb of body weight. The action of LAC in these pathologies may be related to its direct and indirect cholinomimetic effects.

## Kidney Disease and Hemodialysis

Carnitine supplementation is much indicated in kidney diseases because the kidney is a major site of carnitine synthesis. Carnitine sup- plementation can be renoprotective. In one study, high amounts of dietary fructose had adverse effects (higher cholesterol and TGs, lower levels of antioxidants and hypertrophy) on rat kidneys, and concur- rent carnitine supplementation (300 mg/kg per day intraperitoneal) was able to prevent the damage either partially or fully.97 Damage to the kidney or reduced kidney function has a profound effect on carnitine metabolism. It is well established that patients undergoing hemodialysis have carnitine deficiency due to the loss of considerable quantities of carnitine during dialysis, as well as decreased synthesis. Serum carnitine levels drop nearly 80% during hemodialy- sis.1–3 Supplementation with LC (15 mg/kg of intravenous LC at the end of each hemodialysis) helps maintain carnitine status.98 Carnitine-treated dialyzed patients have also shown additional benefits, including the following99–104: • Disappearance of angina pectoris and arrhythmias occurring during dialysis • Reduction of muscle symptoms, including muscle cramps • Increased muscle mass • Significant improvement in chronic anemia, as demonstrated by increased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell count • Improved insulin sensitivity and reduced stress on pancreatic β cells • Decreased serum C-reactive protein (29%) and serum interleu- kin-6 (61%) values Since the early 1990s, a major advancement in the treatment of ane- mia associated with hemodialysis is recombinant human erythropoi- etin therapy. However, this therapy is expensive and has side effects. In one study, LC 1 g intravenously after every dialysis session for months led to a significant reduction in dosage, as well as improve- ments in membrane fragility and endogenous erythropoietin secre- tion.105 Given the high cost of erythropoietin, if doctors are unwilling to follow this procedure, insurance companies should get involved and force dialysis units to employ LC.


Patients with diabetes typically have deficient carnitine status. Studies revealed relationships between low carnitine status and increased plasma fatty acids, which negatively affect insulin action, so it has been recommended that free carnitine determinations should be made even if the patient has good metabolic control.106 Given the risk of athero- sclerotic cardiovascular disease and reduced kidney and liver function found in patients with diabetes, it may simply be more rational to sup- plement all patients with diabetes with LC. Carnitine supplementation was shown to greatly improve periph- eral vascular function, as well as nerve function, in patients with dia- betes.107–110 Carnitine supplementation might also affect blood lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly lipoprotein(a). In a study in type 2 diabetes, 2000 mg of carnitine daily lowered lipoprotein(a)

## 498SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

levels by roughly 20% after 6 months, whereas in another study of patients with markedly elevated lipoprotein(a) levels, even greater reductions were noted.111,112 Insulin sensitivity can be improved with LC supplementation, as shown in a 10-day investigation of newly diabetic men and women. The study consisted of two groups: the control group, which was given a hypocaloric diet to follow (55% carbohydrates, 25% lipids, 20% pro- teins); and the LC group, which consumed the same hypocaloric diet in addition to 2 g of oral LC twice daily. The LC group had no adverse reactions with 4 g/day for 10 days. Both groups had an improvement in fasting and postprandial serum glucose and decreased body weight. Insulin sensitivity improved significantly in the LC group (plasma insulin: 7.0–4.5 μ U/mL; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]: 1.9 to 1.1) compared with the control group, which had no change in plasma insulin or HOMA-IR levels.113

## Neuropathy

Neuropathy can occur for many reasons and may be helped with dif- ferent therapies that are specific to each individual. l-carnitine or LAC may be particularly beneficial if the patient is infected with HIV (asso- ciated with secondary deficiency of LC and also due to antiretroviral drugs), has used chemotherapy drugs (taxanes, platinum drugs and/or vinca alkaloids), or has neuropathy due to diabetes.114 In 21 HIV-positive patients with antiretroviral toxic neuropathy characterized as distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, 1500 mg of LAC twice daily was given for 33 months. Skin biopsies were done from the leg for drug-induced neuropathy. The nerve fibers were quantified and analyzed immunohistochemically. The small sensory fibers showed increased staining after 6 months, indicating nerve regrowth. Compared with controls, patients taking oral LAC for 6 months showed 92% epi- dural, 80% dermal, and 69% sweat gland innervation. The improvement continued at the 12-month biopsy.115 Another similar study showed improvements in subjective measures such as pain, paresthesias, numb- ness, and vibration sensation on neurological examination.116 A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial was done on taxoid-induced peripheral neurop- athy in 239 patients. The results showed LAC at 1000 mg thrice daily reduced the chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity in 50.5% of the patients compared with 24.1% in the control group. The improvement was noticed by week 4 but became significant by week 8 with a decrease in grade 3+ neuropathy and an increase in grade 2. There was a signif- icant improvement in the nerve conductive velocity testing with the LAC group versus control.117 A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy compared oral LAC mg or oral methylcobalamin 0.5 mg three times daily for 24 weeks after meals. The results showed that LAC is as effective as methylcobala- min using neuropathy symptom score and disability score. Both scores were reduced significantly at 12 and 24 weeks in both groups. Nerve conduction velocity and amplitude were improved in the LAC group at 24 weeks.118 Another diabetic neuropathy study using oral 500 mg of LAC thrice daily showed a significant increase in fiber numbers and regenerating clusters. The group taking oral 1000 mg of LAC thrice daily noted improved vibratory parameters as well.119 Intramuscular injections of 1000 mg of LAC daily for 10 days followed by oral LAC 2000 mg daily for 355 days was used for diabetic neuropathy and showed a mean pain score decrease of 39% at the end of the study, with 67% of those receiving LAC and 23% of placebo.109 Because animal studies exist showing benefit in compression neu- ropathy using LAC, a study of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and LAC (3000 mg daily for 2 months after surgery) has been done, with results yet to come.120

## Liver Disease

Carnitine plays an extremely important role in the usage and metabo- lization of fatty acids in the liver. Some evidence indicates that carni- tine deficiency within the liver promotes fatty infiltration (also known as steatosis or liver congestion).121 Alcohol ingestion is a common cause of fatty infiltration of the liver. It has been suggested that chronic alcohol consumption results in a functional deficiency of carnitine. Carnitine was shown to signifi- cantly inhibit and reverse alcohol-induced fatty liver disease.122 Because carnitine normally assists fatty acid transport and oxida- tion in the mitochondria, a high liver carnitine level may be necessary to handle the increased fatty acid load produced by alcohol consump- tion or other liver injury.123 Supplemental carnitine was shown to reduce levels of free fatty acids in patients with liver cirrhosis and to reduce serum TGs and liver enzyme levels while elevating HDL-c in alcohol-induced fatty liver disease.121–123 Carnitine has also proven helpful with hepatitis C in relieving the tremendous fatigue associated with interferon- α treatment. In one study, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis treated with interferon- α (3 million IU three times weekly) were given either carnitine (2 g/day) or placebo for 6 months. Patients treated with interferon plus carnitine showed a marked and significant reduction of both mental and phys- ical fatigue levels.124

## Muscular Dystrophies

Patients with various muscular dystrophies have reduced levels of car- nitine in their skeletal muscles.125–127 Although levels are not as low as those observed in patients with classic myopathic carnitine deficiency, the low carnitine levels are thought to contribute to the muscular weak- ness experienced by these patients. Unfortunately, it is undetermined whether supplemental carnitine would be of any value in patients with muscular dystrophy.

## Low Sperm Counts and Decreased Sperm Motility

Carnitine concentrations are extremely high in the epididymis and spermatozoa, suggesting a role for carnitine in male reproductive function.1–3 The epididymis derives the majority of its energy require- ments from lipids, as do the spermatozoa during transport through the epididymis. After ejaculation, spermatocytes depend on glycoly- sis of glucose and fructose and on oxidation of lactate and pyruvate. Carnitine (in the form of acetylcarnitine, which is derived from pyru- vate) serves as a readily available substrate. The motility of ejaculated sperm correlates positively with acetylcarnitine content.1,3 In human sperm, high carnitine concentrations are critical to sperm energy metabolism. Several studies showed that the level of free carnitine in seminal fluid was strongly correlated with sperm count and motil- ity.128,129 The lower the carnitine content, the more likely it is that a man is infertile. A 2011 study measured seminal free LC and found in fertile men (447.6 mole/L), oligoastheno teratospermic men (157.6 mole/L), asthenospermic men (233.3 mole/L), and azoospermic men (46.5 mole/L).130 Clearly, infertility is associated with decreased LC levels. Given the known physiological role of carnitine in sperm function and its link to male infertility, a study was designed to assess the thera- peutic effect of carnitine in men with low sperm counts and depressed sperm motility.131 One hundred men selected from infertility clin- ics participated in the Italian Study Group on Carnitine and Male Infertility. Each subject was given 3000 mg of LC daily for 4 months. The study results indicated that LC increased sperm counts and sperm motility, in both a qualitative and a quantitative manner: • The number of ejaculated sperm increased from 142 to 163 billion. • The percentage of motile sperm increased from 26.9% to 37.7%.

## 499CHAPTER 63 Carnitine

• The percentage of sperm with rapid linear progression increased from 10.8% to 18%. • The mean sperm velocity increased from 28.4% to 32.5%. The results were even more impressive when only patients with the poorest sperm motility were studied. This subgroup saw even more significant gains on all parameters. For example, the percentage of motile sperm increased from 19.3% to 40.9%, and the percentage of sperm with rapid linear progression increased from 3.1% to 20.3%.

## Androgenetic Alopecia

There are promising in vitro studies on follicular keratinocytes and the effect of a combined natural product including saw palmetto or beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol, carnitine, and thioctic acid.132–134 Carnitine was chosen for its anti-inflammatory activity and showed significant repression in LPS-activated inflammatory genes.132 Another study suggested that “LC stimulates human scalp hair growth by upreg- ulation of proliferation and down-regulation of apoptosis in follicular keratinocytes in vitro.”133 The goal of the researchers was to target both 5-alpha-reductase and inflammatory pathways as a new therapeutic approach to androgenetic alopecia.132–134 One study demonstrated the natural product was more effective than finasteride at suppressing the mRNA expression of 5-alpha-reductase type 1, 2, and 3, DKK-1, FGF- 1, 17beta-HSD-3, TGF-beta1, and beta2.134 A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled observational study was conducted on 51 healthy volunteers (19 males and 32 females) with clinically diagnosed mild to moderate androge- netic alopecia. The study used a 2% l-carnitine l-tartrate liposomal tonic applied locally twice daily for at least 5 hours each application for 6 months. The results showed a significant increase in the total number of terminal scalp hair shafts (170 hairs/cm2 before therapy and 197 hairs/cm2 posttherapy). The number or anagen hair follicles increased by 75%, and the number of telogen hair follicles was signifi- cantly downregulated (25%) in volunteers receiving topical 2% solu- tion. In the placebo group, after 6 months, the telogen hair follicles were downregulated by 38%, and the anagen hair follicles increased by 62%.135

## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency are often severely affected by even the simplest physical activity. Treatment with LC (2 g three times daily) resulted in significant improvements in exercise capability.136

## Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Several reports indicated that systemic carnitine deficiency might be a problem in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Reduced levels of serum carnitine are most often found in AIDS patients. However, more important is the carnitine depletion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Even AIDS patients with normal serum carnitine levels demonstrated low levels of carnitine in white blood cells.137 Increasing the carnitine content of peripheral white blood cells strongly improved lymphocyte function, highlighting the importance of carnitine to immune function. LC was shown to prevent the toxicity of the drug azidothymidine (AZT) on the mitochondria of the muscle cells.138 AZT poisons the mitochondria of the muscle, leading to abnormal energy production within the muscle, which manifests clinically as muscle fatigue and pain. If LC can prevent this negative effect of AZT in human patients with AIDS, it would be a major improvement in the clinical manage- ment of AIDS. Preliminary studies indicated that LC supplementation could improve immune function and reduce the level of human immuno- deficiency virus-induced immune suppression. When AIDS patients treated with AZT were given 6 g/day of LC, it led to significantly increased PBMC proliferation and reduced blood levels of TGs and circulating tumor necrosis factor.139 Given the suspected systemic car- nitine deficiency, along with the tremendous safety of use, carnitine supplementation appears to be warranted in treating AIDS.

## Inborn Errors of Amino Acid Metabolism

The use of carnitine to treat inborn errors of metabolism involving the urea acid cycle appears to be well justified. Preliminary studies showed impressive therapeutic response to LC supplementation in cases of glu- taric aciduria, isovaleric acidemia, propionic acidemia, and methylma- lonic aciduria.140–143

## Protection Against Drug Toxicity

Carnitine was shown to protect against the damaging effects on the heart produced by the chemotherapy drug adriamycin.144 Carnitine was also shown to improve the symptoms attributed to anticonvul- sant medications, such as valproic acid (trade names: Depa, Depakene, Depakote, and Deproic) and carbamazepine (trade names: Epitol and Tegretol).145,146 However, a subsequent study challenged the need to administer carnitine prophylactically because no significant differ- ences were noted in well-being scores between the carnitine group and the placebo group.147

## Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Preliminary evidence indicated that carnitine might be beneficial in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In one double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-crossover trial, 13 of 24 boys receiving car- nitine demonstrated a significant positive response in school and home behavior.148 However, researchers found no significant improvement in ADHD symptoms with LAC (500–1500 mg twice a day, weight dependent) in a U.S. multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of children 5 to 12 years old.149 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on boys with fragile X syndrome ages 6 to 13 years with symptoms of ADHD, LAC (20–50 mg/kg per day) produced a reduction in hyperactivity and improved social behavior compared with placebo counterparts. These improve- ments were measured by Conners’s Parent Global Index Scale and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale.150

## Beta-Thalassemia Major: A small study (n = 30) was done on children

with beta-thalassemia major and short stature and the effect of sup- plemental LC (50 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses) over 6 months. The growth hormone and IGF-1 values were significantly increased after LC therapy.151

## Wound Healing: Wound healing improved significantly compared

with placebo in a rat study with LPC at different dosages. The LPC- treated animals (100 mg/kg/day in drinking water) showed faster blood flow recovery of skin flap wound and improved viability. Also, the necrotic skin area was less than that of placebo-treated rats. Also, another part of the same study showed that the LPC group had dose-dependent (30, 60, 120 mg/kg/day) faster reepithe- lialization compared with the control group.152

## Muscle Cramping: LC was studied in specific conditions to help lessen

or resolve muscle cramping. In a small study of 42 patients with hepatic cirrhosis and painful muscle cramps, LC was given (300 mg three or four times daily) for 8 weeks. The muscle cramp frequency significantly decreased in all patients, with 29% having complete resolution. The visual analog scale score decreased in 27 patients (87%) and increased in 3 patients (10%) after treatment. The response was dose dependent, with better response in the 1200-mg

daily group.153 In another study on patients with dialysis complica- tions of muscle cramping and hypotension, LC (500 mg/day) was combined with vitamin E (200 IU/day) for 45 days and led to a significant improvement in both complications.104

## Narcolepsy: A case report discussed the use of oral LC as a treatment

for narcolepsy during pregnancy. A 32-year-old woman was titrated up to 500 mg twice daily. She had a progressive improvement in daytime somnolence and showed a regular night-time sleep sched- ule. She also reported a decrease in diurnal time for dozing off and the number of diurnal naps.154


The daily dosage of LC in all of its forms has typically been between 1500 and 4000 mg in divided doses; however, a few studies have used up to 6000 mg daily. According to the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the “observed safety level” of LC for long-term supplemen- tation is 2000 mg/day. However, it also stated that “much higher levels have been tested without adverse effects and may be safe.”155


LC is extremely safe, with potential side effects being gastrointestinally related, such as nausea and diarrhea. Again, only LC should be used. The d form, the mirror image of the l form, has side effects, indicating that it interferes with the natural l form of carnitine. Patients under- going hemodialysis given a mixture containing d,l-carnitine for days experienced muscle pain and loss of muscle function, presumably due to lack of energy.156 The symptoms disappeared on cessation of d,l-carnitine supplementation. Subsequent studies showed that d-car- nitine produced an LC deficiency in cardiac and skeletal muscle.157 Although LC resulted in significant improvement in exercise tolerance in patients with angina, d,l-carnitine actually dangerously reduced exercise tolerance in these patients.158


There are two case reports of l-carnitine at 1000 mg/d potentiating the effect of the anticoagulant medication acenocoumarol.159,160 Because acenocoumarol is similar to warfarin, it is advised to also avoid or use caution with carnitine and warfarin. Carnitine and coenzyme Q 10 appear to work synergistically when combined.161 The same is true for pantethine.162 Perhaps the most important interaction is with choline. In young adult women, daily choline supplementation (20 mg/kg body weight) resulted in a 75% lower urinary carnitine excretion than in controls, without significantly altering plasma carnitine concentrations. Studies in guinea pigs demonstrated that choline supplementation resulted in a significantly lower urinary excretion and higher skeletal muscle carnitine concentrations. These studies indicate that choline supple- mentation results in a conservation of carnitine and might increase intracellular carnitine levels.163

fatty acids, various plant sterols (e.g., campesterol, stigmasterol, and sitosterol), and various polyacetylene compounds.1,2 Other notable compounds isolated from centella include the flavonoids kaempferol, quercetin, and their glycosides; myoi- nositol; sugars; a bitter substance (vellarin); amino acids; and resins.1,2


Centella has been used as a medicine in India since prehistoric times and is thought to be identical to the plant mandukaparni, listed in the Susruta Samhita (one of the valuable treatises in Ayurveda). Centella was also used extensively as a medicine, both internally and externally, by the people of Java and other islands of Indonesia. The medicinal use of centella in India and Indonesia centered around its ability to heal wounds and relieve leprosy, although it was also considered to be one of the “Rasayana” (reju- venator) herbal medicines and was used to enhance memory and prolong life.1,2 In the 19th century, centella and its extracts were incorporated into the Indian pharmacopeia. In addition to being recommended for wound healing, it was recommended for the treatment of skin condi- tions such as leprosy, lupus, varicose ulcers, eczema, and psoriasis. It was also used to treat diarrhea, fever, amenorrhea, and diseases of the female genitourinary tract.1 In China, the leaves are prescribed for turbid leukorrhea and toxic fevers, whereas the shoots are used for boils and fevers. The plant is also used in the treatment of fractures, contusions, strains, and snake- bites.1 Centella was also used in China to delay senescence. One of the reported “miracle elixirs of life,” centella’s reputation as a promoter of longevity stems from the report of Chinese herbalist LiChing Yun, who reportedly lived 256 years. LiChing Yun’s longevity was suppos- edly a result of his regular use of an herbal mixture chiefly composed of centella.4 C. asiatica was first accepted as a drug in France in the 1880s. Since then, centella extracts have been used to treat many of the previously listed conditions, along with those described in the section “Clinical Applications.” Centella, or gotu kola, has aroused much curiosity in American consumers. Many confuse gotu kola with kola nuts and assume gotu kola’s rejuvenating activity is nothing more than the stimulant effect of caffeine. However, gotu kola is not related to the kola nut (Cola nitida or Cola acuminata), nor does it contain any caffeine.


The majority of pharmacological investigations on C. asiatica focused on the triterpene’s wound-healing and venotonic activ- ity.1,2 Although the exact mechanism of action has not yet been fully determined, a number of interesting observations have been made: • In one of the early pharmacological investigations of centella, Boiteau and Ratsimamanga5 demonstrated that asiaticoside sub- stantially hastened the healing of experimentally induced wounds. These authors concluded that asiaticoside worked selectively in stimulating the rapid and healthy activity of the reticuloendothelial system. • Additional studies on the mechanisms of action of centella to enhance wound healing showed that asiaticoside, given orally, by intramuscular injection, or by implantation to rats, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, produced a wide range of effects (Box 64.1). • The efficacy of centella in stimulating collagen synthesis was demonstrated in human tissue cultures.3 Interestingly, this research demonstrated an additional benefit when vitamin C was added to the experimental cultures. • The outcome of centella’s complex actions is a balanced multipha- sic effect on cells and tissues participating in the process of healing, particularly in connective tissues. Enhanced development of the normal connective tissue matrix is perhaps the prime therapeutic action of C. asiatica. • Centella was shown to enhance the connective tissue structure of the perivascular sheath, reduce sclerosis, and improve blood flow through the affected veins.1,6 Research has also demonstrated positive effects of centella on the central nervous system, cognitive function, stress, and anxiety.2 The major effects are an enhancement of cholinergic mechanisms and a significant antioxidant action via increasing glutathione levels.7,8 Presumably, these mechanisms are responsible for the improvements in mental function noted in both animal and clinical trials. Excellent results in improving cognitive function and memory were seen in ani- mal models of Alzheimer’s disease.9 Ethanolic and methanolic extracts of C. asiatica have shown sig- nificant protection and lowered blood glucose to normal levels in glucose tolerance tests carried out in alloxan-induced diabetic rats.10 Water extract has a chemopreventive effect on colon tumorigenesis,11 and asiaticoside might be useful in cancer chemotherapy because it induces apoptosis and enhances the antitumor activity of vincristine in HO HO R 2R 1 R 1 R 2 R 3 OR 3 O Asiatic acid Madecassic acid Madasiatic acid Asiaticoside Madecassoside H OH OH H OH CH 2 OH CH 2 OH CH 3 CH 2 OH CH 2 OH H H H Glucose-glucose-rhamnose Glucose-glucose-rhamnose

cancer cells.12 Animal studies also demonstrate cardioprotective activity against cardiomyopathy in rats, and results strongly suggest the car- dioprotective activity of the plant in limiting ischemia-reperfusion-in- duced myocardial injury through preservation and restoration of the antioxidant defense system.13 Centella was also shown to possess other diverse pharmacological effects in experimental models, including anti- ulcer, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and spasmolytic activity.2


Centella is a valuable agent for the healing of wounds and the treat- ment of venous insufficiency and may also prove useful in improving mental function. Table 64.1 provides an abridged list of documented clinical applications of C. asiatica. Details on some of the more popular uses of centella are discussed in the following sections.

## Burns

The standardized extract from C. asiatica has been used effectively in the treatment of patients with second- and third-degree burns caused by boiling water, electrical current, or gas explosion. Daily local appli- cation, intramuscular injections of the extract, or both, resulted in excellent results when treatment was started immediately after the accident.14 The extract prevented or limited the shrinking and swelling of the skin caused by skin infection, and it inhibited scar formation, increased healing, and decreased fibrosis. A randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of silver sulfadiazine versus Centiderm (an ointment made from an ethanol extract of fresh C. asiatica leaves) in patients with partial-thickness burns from October 2014 to February 2015 in Iran.15 Burn wounds were treated once daily, and patients fol- lowed up daily with a burn specialist until the wounds were completely healed, with subjective and objective variables recorded on days 3, 7, and 14. The use of Centiderm ointment not only improved the objec- tive and subjective findings in less than 3 days but also improved the reepithelialization and complete healing times (about 7 days sooner compared with placebo).

## Cellulite and Striae Gravidarum

Cellulite, known as liposclerosis, is a noninflammatory change within the subcutaneous adipose tissue caused by an increase in the volume of fat cells or by the increased division of connective tissue, which causes constriction of small blood vessels. Treatments for cellulite involve preparations that affect the adipose and connective tissue and improve microcirculation; they can be used topically, internally, and/ or transdermally. The effect of centella in the treatment of cellulite appears to be related to its ability to enhance connective tissue structure and reduce sclerosis by acting directly on fibroblasts. Madecassoside, an extract from C. asiatica, is known to induce collagen expression and/or mod- ulate inflammatory mediators.16 Triterpenes of C. asiatica increase the metabolism of lysine and proline, the amino acids that build collagen, and increase the synthesis of tropocollagen and mucopolysaccharide in the connective tissues, thus improving the nutrition of tissues and providing connective vascular stimulation.17 In several clinical studies, standardized extracts of C. asiatica demonstrated good results in the treatment of cellulite and the preven- tion of stretch marks during pregnancy. In the treatment of cellulite, Bourguignon observed the action of the extract on several types of cel- lulite in 65 patients who underwent other therapies without success.18 Over a period of 3 months, good results were produced in 58% of the patients and satisfactory results in 20%. A study of 60 people with cellu- lite evaluated the influence of Madecassol® applied four times a day for months.19 Results clearly showed a beneficial effect of the gotu kola extract on inhibiting the progression of cellulite and a significant improvement in the skin condition in 85% of the experiment participants. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the cream Trofolastin®, containing an extract of C. asiatica, α -tocopherol, hydro- lyzed collagen, and elastin, was carried out on 100 pregnant women.20 The cohort was split evenly between the treatment group and the placebo group. After 30 months of treatment, striae occurred in 56% of the placebo group compared with 34% of the treated group; this difference was statistically significant. In women with a history of striae during puberty, the active cream induced a significant absolute prevention in 89% of the cases, whereas in the placebo group, all the women developed striae.

## Cirrhosis of the Liver

Darnis et al. reported on the therapeutic use of an extract of C. asiatica in alcohol-induced cirrhosis (six patients), cirrhosis of unknown eti- ology (two patients), and chronic hepatitis.21 In the cirrhosis patients, improvement in the histological findings and regression of inflamma- tory infiltration were observed. No effect was observed in the patients with chronic hepatitis. Other reports supported the use of centella in fibrotic conditions of the liver.22

## Keloids

Keloids and hypertrophic scars are characterized by a prolonged inflammatory phase that may go on for months or even years with- out progressing to the maturation phase. The inflammatory phase is characterized histologically by large numbers of immature, swollen collagen bundles intermingled with inflammatory debris, whereas the maturation phase is characterized by mature fibrocytes, normal colla- gen fibers, and few inflammatory cell elements. The standardized extract of C. asiatica demonstrated impressive clinical results in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars.23–25

## 504SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

The mechanism of action appears to be multifaceted but is primarily the result of reducing the inflammatory phase of scar formation while simultaneously enhancing the maturation phase of scar formation. Asiaticoside has been shown to downregulate the expression of TGF- β 1 mRNA and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 and upregu- late TGF- β 3 mRNA expression, resulting in the ability to decompose the products of type I collagen and reduce hypertrophic scars.26 It has been further proposed that asiaticoside interferes with scar forma- tion by increasing the synthesis of acidic mucopolysaccharides and increasing the activity of myofibroblasts. In one study, 227 patients with keloids or hypertrophic scars were treated by oral administration with a standardized centella extract (effective dosage 60–90 mg). The centella extract was used alone in 139 patients (the curative group), and 88 used the extract along with surgical scar revision (preventive group).24 In the curative group, 116 patients (82%) were found to have benefited from the extract after 2 to 18 months, either by relief of their symptoms or by the disappearance of the inflammatory phase. In a double-blind substudy of 46 of the 139 patients, 22 of 27 receiving the extract improved, whereas only 9 of 19 given a placebo improved. In the preventive group, the centella extract also demonstrated a signif- icant positive effect. The therapeutic course in these patients began a few weeks before surgery. If a positive response was observed, the patient was brought to surgery and kept on the centella extract for months. (This method of preselection allowed the researchers to offer other forms of therapy to unresponsive patients.) Clinical improve- ment was observed in 72 of the 88 patients (79%).

## Kidney Disease

Traditional Chinese medicine has used gotu kola to treat kidney dis- eases for centuries. Its direct benefits for the kidneys have only been shown in animals but are encouraging. In rats, gotu kola showed a pro- tective effect from Adriamycin-induced nephropathy, resulting in dra- matically improved kidney function.27 Another study combined gotu kola in conjunction with naringenin and showed decreased fibrosis formation in the kidneys.28

## Leprosy

Several investigators reported impressive clinical results using C. asi- atica and its extracts (oral, intramuscular, or topical) in the treatment of leprosy in both uncontrolled and controlled studies.29,30 The thera- peutic response was comparable to that of dapsone, the standard allo- pathic drug used in the treatment of leprosy. In addition to its wound-healing activity, it appears that oxyasiati- coside, an oxidized form of asiaticoside, inhibited the growth of the tubercle bacillus in vitro and in vivo by dissolving the waxy coating of Mycobacterium leprae.5

## Improving Mental Function and Quality of Life

The neuropharmacological properties of C. asiatica have been exten- sively studied. Mechanisms of action for its efficacy in memory dis- orders involve antioxidant, free radical scavenging, and cholinergic modulatory activities. Although long used to promote improved men- tal function, the first clinical investigation involving centella signifi- cantly increased the mental abilities of 30 developmentally disabled children.31 After a 12-week period, the children were more attentive and better able to concentrate on assigned tasks. Based on historical use and clinical studies, centella may also help improve mental function and quality of life in the elderly. Eighty elderly subjects participated in a double-blind study and were ran- domly assigned to receive placebo or standardized extract of C. asiatica at doses of 250, 500, and 750 mg once daily for 90 days.32 The subjects were evaluated to establish baseline data of physical performance using the 30-second chair-stand test, hand-grip test, and 6-minute walk test. The health-related quality of life was assessed using a standard ques- tionnaire. These assessments were repeated every month throughout the 3-month experimental period using the aforementioned parame- ters. Moreover, 1 month after the cessation of C. asiatica treatment, all subjects were also evaluated using these parameters again. The results showed that after 2 months of treatment, C. asiatica at doses of and 750 mg/day increased lower extremity strength assessed via the 30-second chair-stand test. In addition, the higher doses of C. asiat- ica improved the life satisfaction subscale within the physical function subscale. Therefore the results from this study appear to support the traditional reputation of C. asiatica on strength improvement, espe- cially in the lower extremities of the elderly. C. asiatica also possesses the potential to be a natural resource for increasing vigor and strength in healthy elderly persons. Asiatic acid exerts a significant neuroprotective effect on cultured cortical cells by potentiation of the cellular oxidative defense mecha- nism, which may prove efficacious in protecting neurons from the oxi- dative damage caused by exposure to excessive glutamate.33 The plant accelerates nerve regeneration and contains multiple active fractions that increase neurite elongation in vitro, suggesting that components in centella may be useful for accelerating repair of damaged neurons.34 Centella is also being investigated for its potential in Alzheimer’s disease as an inhibitor of β -amyloid (A β ) formation.35,36 Water extracts of C. asiatica inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes, particularly cPLA2 and sPLA2, which play key roles in A β -induced neurotoxicity.37 Further studies on the water extract found that caffeoylquinic acids act as the active substances preventing A β -induced cell death by enhanc- ing mitochondrial biogenesis in conjunction with activating antioxi- dant response genes and normalizing calcium homeostasis.38

## Relieving Anxiety

Centella is viewed as an anxiolytic on the basis of in vitro models and emerging clinical evidence. An early study was conducted in humans to measure the effect of centella on reducing the acoustic startle response. After a single administration of centella, subjects experienced a signifi- cantly reduced acoustic startle response compared with the placebo—a clear indication of significant antianxiety action.39 In an open clinical study in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, a 70% hydroethan- olic extract of C. asiatica (500 mg/capsule, twice daily, after meal) was shown to significantly (P < 0.01) attenuate anxiety-related disorders and reduce the stress phenomenon and depression.40

## Scleroderma

A standardized extract of C. asiatica was tested in several trials in the treatment of scleroderma (including systemic sclerosis).41–44 In addition to decreasing skin induration, patients noticed a lessening of arthralgia and improved finger motility. Presumably, the positive therapeutic response was a result of centella’s eutrophic effect on connective tissue, thereby preventing the excessive collagen synthesis observed in scleroderma.

## Venous and Microcirculatory Disorders

The most well-documented clinical utility for a standardized extract of C. asiatica is in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, venous hypertension, and microcirculatory disorders.45–51 The effect of Centella in venous insufficiency and varicose veins appears to be related to its ability to enhance connective tissue structure, reduce scle- rosis, and improve blood flow through the affected limbs. Asiaticoside has been shown to improve microcirculation and reverse fibrosis in humans with varicose veins. 3, 5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, a constit- uent of gotu kola, has been found to display an antithrombotic and

inhibitory effect on dynamic coagulation.52 This is significant when one considers that fibrin clots play a pivotal role in cardiovascular conditions. In the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, significant improvement in symptomatology (e.g., feelings of heaviness in the lower legs, paresthesias, nocturnal cramps), physical findings (e.g., edema, telangiectasias, trophic ulcers, vein distensibility), and func- tional capacity (improved venous flow) was observed in approximately 80% of patients in the clinical trials.1,45–51 In studies of patients with venous hypertension (ambulatory venous pressure >42 mm Hg), detailed evaluations using laser Doppler flowmetry, transcutaneous oxygen, and carbon dioxide tension mea- surements and the determination of capillary filtration rate, ankle circumference, and ankle edema, along with detailed symptom evalua- tion, clearly demonstrated that centella extracts were clinically effective in dealing with this disorder.45–47 The standardized extract of C. asiatica also showed an ability to improve diabetic microangiopathy, it prevented the edema and micro- circulation alterations seen during medium- to long-distance flights, and it normalized the echographic character of carotid arteries with significant plaque.49–51


Standardized extracts of C. asiatica were shown in many clinical stud- ies to greatly aid wound repair.53,54 The types of wounds healed include the following: • Surgical wounds, such as episiotomies and ear, nose, and throat surgeries • Skin ulcers caused by arterial or venous insufficiency • Traumatic injuries to the skin • Gangrene • Skin grafts • Schistosomiasis lesions • Perineal lesions produced during childbirth


The majority of clinical studies on C. asiatica used proprietary for- mulas available in Europe (e.g., Madecassol, TECA, Centelase). These standardized extracts contain asiaticoside (40%), asiatic acid (29%– 30%), madecassic acid (29%–30%), and madecassoside (1%–2%). Because the concentration of triterpenes in centella varies between 1.1% and 8%, it is difficult to calculate an appropriate dosage when simply using the crude plant material. However, because most samples yield a concentration between 2.2% and 3.4%, approximately 2 to 4 g/ day of crude plant material would contain an appropriate quantity of triterpenes, although it is unknown if this correlates with the clinical efficacy of the standardized extracts. Daily dosages of the various forms of centella are as follows: • Standardized extract (40% asiaticoside, 29%–30% asiatic acid, 29%–30% madecassic acid, and 1%–2% madecassoside): 60 to mg/day • Crude dried plant leaves: 2 to 4 g/day • Tincture (1:5): 10 to 20 mL/day • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL/day


C. asiatica and its extracts are well tolerated, especially orally.1,2 There is one report of three case histories of women (61, 52, and 49 years old) who developed jaundice after taking C. asiatica for 30, 20, and 60 days, respectively.55 However, there was little description or validation of the product in question. Nonetheless, the hepatic lesions were quite signif- icant on biopsy (granulomatous hepatitis with marked necrosis and apoptosis, chronic hepatitis with cirrhotic transformation and intense necroinflammatory activity, and granulomatous hepatitis). All patients improved with C. asiatica discontinuation and ursodeoxycholic acid 10 mg/kg per day. The topical application of a salve containing centella was reported to cause contact dermatitis, although quite infrequently.1 Although the oral administration of asiaticoside at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight was not proved toxic in toxicology studies, the toxic dose of asiaticoside by intramuscular application to mice and rabbits was reported as 40 to 50 mg/kg body weight.1 Asiaticoside was implicated as a possible skin carcinogen when repeated applications were used in an experimental animal model.56 Teratologic studies using the extract in rabbits proved negative.23

## 507CHAPTER 65 Chinese Prepared Medicines

of the Taiping Period.12 Few true patent medicines exist anymore in the Chinese pharmacy. Many of these medicines have become part of the public domain, making it more appropriate to refer to them col- lectively as CPMs. Keeping Chinese medicine formulae as trade secrets has led to some losses of knowledge and experience accumulated over generations. Drugs as well as dietary supplements are subject to regulations and disclosure requirements; it has become increasingly difficult for Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners to keep their prescriptions and treatment methods as trade secrets. In 1993 the Chinese gov- ernment issued the Regulations on the Protection of Traditional Chinese Medicines which, to this date, provides administrative protection to certain prescriptions and manufacturing processes.13 Unfortunately, there are too many dubious CPMs in the worldwide market that have been adulterated in various ways, some containing Western prescriptive medicines, toxic elements, and endangered spe- cies often hidden from the unsuspecting consumer.14 In their quest for safe, natural, and effective medicine, consumers may find serious, unexpected medical consequences. This is an issue that deserves scru- tiny by consumers, practitioners, and regulators alike. As with most natural products, CPM quality and purity are left to the discretion of the companies themselves. Typical images of the U.S. “Wild West” include cowboys, American Indians, farms, and the frontier life. However, there was another, less- er-known presence in the West: the lives of Chinese immigrants. Many came to America seeking life on the “Gold Mountain,” the view of America that had been created in China during the 1800s. According to Paul Buell, writing in his Chinese Medicine on the Golden Mountain book: When in the midnineteenth century Chinese immigrants began to arrive in America, all kinds of traditional medical practitioners came with them; well-practiced Chinese medicine was often supe- rior to contemporary western practice.15 The immigrants, mostly men, left their families to mine for gold. Many ended up working as miners or other laborers. They brought with them their traditional form of Chinese medicine and their tradi- tional herbal medicine, which included various forms of CPM. CHM is a highly evolved system of traditional medicine that draws from a materia medica composed of thousands of individual herbs (herbs in TCM include plant, mineral, and animal).11,16 CPMs would generally be considered an adjunct to CHM in most practices because they are convenient and good alternatives to the strong, bitter-tasting decoc- tions often used in practice. Many practitioners, particularly in the West, prefer to use granulated Chinese herbs or powdered herbs.

## Global Market

The market for CPMs is huge. More than 5000 “licensed patent med- icines” are estimated to exist in China.17 According to China Today, exports of CHMs worldwide reached $20 billion in 2002. About 5% of this amount was China’s share, and prepared medicines comprised less than one-third of this. In China, the famous Tong Ren Tang factory, which exports the most CPMs in China, earned $14.5 million.18 This amount continued to steadily rise into 2018. Outside of the enormous “inside China market,” the growing inter- est in and use of natural medicine worldwide are driving the consump- tion of prepared medicines rapidly upward. As mentioned previously, this growth has sparked abuse and problems with product labeling and safety that the entire profession is working to counteract. Although Chinese medicine and pharmacy began to spread out- side of China’s borders nearly 2000 years ago, it is only in the past years that interest has grown in North America. Much of this is a result of former President Richard Nixon’s trip to the People’s Republic of China in the early 1970s and subsequent reporters’ visits and articles, especially those of James Reston of the New York Times. The growth of acupuncture and oriental medical practices, such as herbal medicine, in the United States has been steady since that time. The traditional loose herb recipes used in CHM are cooked and made into medicinal soups, which are often bitter and difficult for the American palate. The Chinese solution to this dilemma was to increase the use of raw licorice in the formula and to offer sugar wafers to the patient to help offset the bitter taste, although most Chinese welcome a bitter taste as a normal part of Asian cuisine. The prepared medicines offer an alternative to traditional preparations. A number of compa- nies, particularly in Taiwan and California, have begun to popularize the manufacture and sale of powder and tincture formulas in the sin- gle herb form to help “bridge” the traditional form and the prepared, more palatable, forms of medicine. This allows the practitioner to still use the traditional approach—that of mixing and adjusting the formu- las tailored to the patient’s individual diagnosis. Prepared formulas are fixed, of course, and do not allow any adjustments in the ingredients. Before the mid-1970s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the import and sale of traditional medicines by ethnic groups. New legislation and court rulings since then have lifted these restrictions, which, coupled with the explosion of acupuncture on the American health scene, has opened the door to the spread of prepared medicines.19 Now, because of this rapid growth in the sale and use of prepared medicines, problems with adulterants and false labeling are increas- ing, especially in California, where a multiagency herbal medicine task force involving numerous California and federal government agencies was formed in response. The California Department of Health Services documents state that “most imported Asian patent medicines do not fully comply with California laws.”19 Although some of these violations are potentially dangerous and may involve toxic ingredients and the inclusion of endangered species, many involve labeling issues, which can often be sorted out by revising the labeling at the company of origin.

# FORMULATIONS AND PREPARATIONS

CPMs are prepared in numerous different forms. As far back as 200 bc, Chinese pharmaceuticals had a surprising level of sophistication. Pills were bound together using a wide variety of animal and human sub- stances.20 Box 65.1 lists 15 of the most common dose forms of CPM. In China, prepared medicines are produced at factories located through- out the country. Reputation and awards are important to these main- land Chinese operations. Factories such as the Chongqing Tong Jun Ge Medicine Works in the Sichuan province, built in 1908, are proud of their products. This factory produces more than 200 medicines in therapeutic categories.20 Roadside and rooftop billboards across China extol the benefits of “famous” CPMs and display the awards various formulas have received over the years. Longevity is an important virtue attributed to specific herbs and formulas in Asian medicine. Ginseng, in all its many species and preparations, is the most revered and used herb in China. The pursuit of longevity is central to its popularity, aside from the fact that it is a highly useful and effective herb. An interesting side note is that the American species of ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, is exported in great quantities to China, only to be repackaged and exported back to Western markets. American ginseng is considered a milder, more “supportive” ginseng in action, making it more suitable for the elderly and weak.

## 508SECTION IV Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Ginsengs are part of the tonic herb family, a major classification that does not exist in the conventional Western pharmacy. The most famous factory for herbal medicine products in China is the Tong Ren Tang Pharmacy in Beijing. The Tong Ren Tang Pharmacy, first estab- lished in 1669, has been operated by the same family for more than years. Prepared medicines produced in this factory have generally been held in the highest reputation in China, where the factory has supplied medicines to Chinese royalty over several centuries. The drug control acts implemented by the Chinese government in the 1970s and 1980s have helped further guarantee quality control of prepared medicines in China, and companies such as the Tong Ren Tang pride themselves on following these standards.11 As noted earlier in this chapter, Tong Ren Tang has rapidly expanded its operations into many other coun- tries. Indeed, the company is planning oversees factories and growing operations.

# ADULTERANTS, ENDANGERED SPECIES,

# AND STANDARDS

The issue of adulterants and endangered species has increasingly threatened the reputation of CPM as safe and effective. The massive historical and growing contemporary usage of these products in Asia and the world often obscures these quality and ethical realities. The use of tiger bone, rhino horn, bear gallbladder, and seahorse are reali- ties in a system of medicine that spans the centuries. Raising the con- sciousness of practitioners who grew up in that culture is the task of education to reshape that culture. Trafficking of illegal products is tied to big money, and separation between this practice and the legitimate market can be challenging. Western pharmaceuticals find their way into “herbal” products as “secret” ingredients that boost the effective- ness of the actions. Government control in the countries of origin is one thing, but controlling this globally, given widespread corruption and conflicting priorities, is a difficult task. The fundamental question remains: “Is the product purchased today in the Asian supermarket or local health food store free of adulterants and endangered species?” Many prepared medicines made outside mainland China lack the same quality controls as the factories within China. Factories and sellers within China can be visited and found to have good-quality products determined to be safe and free of adulterants. In 1975 an herbal-based preparation called Toukuwan was manufactured in Hong Kong by the Nan-Lien Pharmaceutical Company and widely promoted in the United States as a treatment for rheumatism and arthritis. The FDA banned the importation of Toukuwan after it dis- covered four drugs, including valium, in the Chuifong preparation. Various prescription drugs have also been discovered in other pre- pared medicines. The Journal of the American Medical Association also reported four cases of agranulocytosis caused by prepared medicines in 1975, before the FDA ban. The Chuifong product has continued to appear under various names, such as “miracle herb,” since 1975.21,22 Caution must be used when purchasing and prescribing prepared herbal medicines, and we recommend using only well-known and reputable manufacturers. If consumers are in doubt, we recommend using products pro- duced at American, Canadian, or Australian companies, which typ- ically are subject to far more quality control standards than those in Asia, and we suggest always consulting practitioners who research the origins of the various products they use and recommend. In May 1994, Traffic USA and the World Wildlife Fund pub- lished “Prescription for Extinction: Endangered Species and Patented Oriental Medicines in Trade.”23 This report gave insight into the vast number of endangered species being used in natural medicine. The report indicated which products and traditional formulas contained endangered or threatened species, according to Appendices I, II, and III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora.24 Lu,25 writing in the China Daily, described new European regula- tions in 2004 regarding the importation of CHMs into the European market. He stated the following: The directive regulates that manufacturers who export herbal medicines to the EU market must get the union’s GMP (Good Manufacturing Product) certificate, products quality must com- ply with EU pharmacopoeia, and importers should have import licenses. … But generally speaking, the directive, which for the first time grants TCM legal status as medicines, will benefit Chinese medicine makers to explore the European market in the future. Currently, most of the TCM products exported to the EU market are under the category of food, native produce, health products, or pharmaceutical ingredients, instead of medicine. Industry experts said that when one TCM product is registered as traditional herbal medicine in the EU, it indicates great market potentials. First, the market value of TCM will be greatly lifted compared to being sold as food or pharmaceutical ingredients. Second, the legal status as medicine would allow TCM to join EU countries’ hospitalization insurance system. And EU’s recognition of TCM will help reduce possible unfair treatment of Chinese medicines from other coun- tries. Meanwhile, domestic makers should strengthen research and development, dismiss some ingredients which are unaccept- able to western people, and develop products to cater for the huge European market.

## 509CHAPTER 65 Chinese Prepared Medicines

Hong Kong, long a stronghold of TCM despite a restrictive anti- TCM atmosphere under British rule, has upgraded its standards for Chinese herbs. The Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong was formed in 1999 to protect public health and consumers’ rights and to ensure the professional standard of Chinese medicine practitioners and the trade of Chinese medicines. On the council’s website, Shaw17,26 discussed the trailblazing approach Australia took to create standards for the practice and sale of CHMs: In that country [Australia], products were either “listed” or “regis- tered.” Listed products were of certified quality and were required to have supporting evidence of safety from the literature. No claims regarding efficacy could be made. Registered products equated to those with a license in the UK. Shaw also referred to the 1996 report “Towards a Safer Choice,” which resulted from a review of the practice of TCM in Australia. The report concluded that regulation of CHMs and acupuncture practi- tioners was necessary and led to the Chinese Medicine Regulation Act of 1999, which set out statutory regulation for such practitioners in the state of Victoria. The intention was that regulation would eventually be brought in on a national scale. Shaw emphasized that this was being done for the benefit of the public, not practitioners. Summing up, Shaw listed five elements for improving the safety of CHMs: • Research into efficacy and safety • Training of practitioners • Quality herbs • Adverse effect monitoring • Appropriate regulation Also on the council’s website is a valuable list of safety concerns raised by Anderson21 of the Hong Kong Medicines Control Agency, listed as follows: • Lack of adequate authentication • Intentional or accidental substitution • Use of toxic substances and heavy metals (e.g., arsenic disulphide) • Use of toxic animal materials (e.g., Bufo secretions) • Use of synthetic drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti­ inflammatory drugs) • Inadequate or inaccurate labeling

# DISPENSARY GUIDE

CPM serves a number of different therapeutic purposes in and out of the practitioner’s office. First and foremost, it is best prescribed within the principles of prescribing of traditional CHMs. For example, formulas for clearing heat or dispelling dampness require some under- standing of the philosophy underlying these principles. If CHMs are just prescribed cookbook style, then individual patient reactions can- not be understood and tracked properly, and the full effect of the for- mulas will not be appreciated. Secondly, CPM can augment and support traditional decoc- tion-style prescribing. Thirdly, CPM is most valuable in acute pre- scribing and generally lends itself to OTC use. OTC use is best with input from trained Chinese medicine practitioners. In the case of Yin Chiao, described in the following, this widely used effective formula is most often prescribed at the onset of colds. Then there is the formula called Chuan Xin Lian (Andrographis anti-inflammatory tablets), which has tremendous effectiveness in inhibiting common bacterial infections, almost an “herbal antibiotic.”11 A final example of use- ful CPM in acute prescribing is the famous formula called Yunnan Baiyao. This is the most important CPM one should have at hand (according to general usage), at home and on the road. It is an emer- gency medicine stated as useful in all cases of injury. The signature of Yunnan Baiyao as traditionally dispensed involves little bottles of yel- low powder with a tiny red “emergency” pill that is said to help revive critically injured individuals. Yang and Liang27 described it as follows: Yunnan Baiyao, literally meaning Yunnan White medicine, smells like a walk through an exotic forest. That’s a clue to its composi- tion: a dozen or so herbs from the southwestern flora-abundant province of Yunnan—but exactly which herbs remains a state secret. Successfully used for more than 80 years, Yunnan Baiyao, now available in several forms, is a veritable cure all and an essen- tial, trusty family medicine in China. Because of the questionable standards of prepared medicines man- ufactured in Asia and generally outside China, it is suggested that prac- titioners scrutinize the labels of products from unknown sources or avoid them all together. With correct labeling, ingredients of prepared medicines should be obvious to anyone who can read Latin or Chinese herbal names. In recent years, prepared medicine companies have become well established in the United States. Several high-quality manufacturers are now producing more suitable formulas. These tinctures, powders, and capsules are usually based on well-documented classic formulas.

## 511CHAPTER 66 Cimicifuga racemosa (Black Cohosh)

• Constituents that did not bind to estrogen receptors but did sup- press LH secretion • Constituents able to bind to estrogen receptor sites and to inhibit LH secretion • Compounds that did bind to estrogen receptors but that did not inhibit LH secretion The authors concluded that “the LH suppressive effect of C. race- mosa extracts observed in menopausal women and ovariectomized rats is caused by at least three different synergistically acting compounds.” One of cimicifuga’s key pharmacological effects is inhibition of the secretion of LH by the pituitary gland. This effect is accomplished equally by components that do and do not bind to estrogen receptors. If cimicifuga was simply mimicking the effects of estrogen, it would certainly alter the secretion of other pituitary hormones just like estro- gen, but it does not. It appears that enhancement of dopaminergic activity is the responsible mechanism for some of these central effects on menopausal symptoms.5,12 Cimicifuga extracts also appear to exert some beneficial effects in preventing bone loss. In an experiment carried out on ovariectomized rats, cimicifuga extract increased the expression of collagen I and osteocalcin. Similarly, other animal studies demonstrated that cimicif- uga extract significantly reduced the urinary parameters of increased bone metabolism and bone loss. The effects in these animal models were similar to raloxifene, a well-confirmed SERM. Importantly, although early studies reported a direct estrogenic effect with cimicifuga, the current perspective is that ethanol and iso- propanol extracts of black cohosh do not contain formononetin or other estrogenic flavonoids and therefore do not bind to the estro- gen receptor, upregulate estrogen-dependent genes, or stimulate the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors in in vitro and animal mod- els.5,13,14 Black cohosh (8% triterpene glycosides) was shown to induce a concentration-dependent decrease in both estrogen receptor alpha (ER α ) and progesterone receptor (PR-A/B) protein levels, supporting the potential of black cohosh as a preventative measure against breast cancer initiation and progression.15 A systematic review conducted on black cohosh use in women with or at risk of breast cancer concluded that evidence does not support an association between black cohosh and increased risk of breast cancer.16 Interestingly, of the studies reviewed, two studies reported significant reductions in the risk of primary breast cancer among postmenopausal women (adjusted odds ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval; 0.27–0.82), and risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval; 0.63–0.89). Seventeen trials showed no significant effect on cir- culating hormone levels or proliferation in estrogen-responsive tissues. Stock photo Stock photo

C. racemosa extracts are by far the most widely used and thoroughly studied natural alternatives to HRT in menopause. Clinical studies showed that cimicifuga extracts relieved not only hot flashes but also depression and vaginal atrophy.5,17–25 Although evidence indicates that cimicifuga may provide benefit in other gynecological complaints, such as premenstrual syndrome, amenorrhea (both primary and secondary), dysmenorrhea, polymen- orrhea, uterine fibroids, and fibrocystic breast disease, its primary clin- ical application is menopause.24–27

## Menopause

In one of the first clinical studies, a large open study involving doctors and 629 female patients, cimicifuga extract (two tablets twice a day, providing a daily dose of 4 mg 27-deoxyactein) produced clear improvement of menopausal symptoms in more than 80% of patients within 6 to 8 weeks.20 As shown in Table 66.1, both physical and psy- chological symptoms improved. Most patients reported noticeable benefits within 4 weeks after the onset of cimicifuga therapy. After to 8 weeks, complete resolution of symptoms was achieved in a large percentage of patients. Cimicifuga was well tolerated; there was no dis- continuation of therapy, and only 7% of patients reported mild transi- tory stomach complaints. In one of the first double-blind studies, 60 patients were given cimicifuga extract (two tablets twice a day providing a daily dose of 4 mg 27-deoxyactein), conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day), or diazepam (2 mg/day) for 12 weeks.21 Results from standard indexes of menopausal symptoms indicated a clear advantage of cimicifuga extract over both drugs. Cimicifuga’s effect on relieving depressive mood and anxiety associated with menopause was far superior to either diazepam or con- jugated estrogens (Table 66.2). One of the most used assessments in clinical studies in menopause is the Kupperman Menopausal Index. This quantitative assessment of menopausal symptoms is achieved by grading severity: severe = 3, moderate = 2, mild = 1, not present = 0. The symptoms assessed include the following: • Hot flashes • Depressive moods • Profuse perspiration • Feelings of vertigo • Sleep disturbances • Loss of concentration • Headache • Joint pain • Nervousness/irritability • Heart palpitation The results of the Kupperman Menopausal Index from this trial clearly demonstrated cimicifuga extract’s superiority over conjugated estrogens and diazepam, especially when safety and side effects were taken into consideration. In another early double-blind study, 80 patients were given cimicif- uga extract (two tablets twice a day, providing a daily dose of 4 mg 27-deoxyactein), conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day), or placebo for 12 weeks.22 Cimicifuga produced better results in the Kupperman Menopausal Index, the Hamilton anxiety test, and the vaginal lining than estrogens or placebo. The number of hot flashes experienced each day dropped from an average of five to less than one in the cimicif- uga group. In comparison, the estrogen group only dropped from 5 to 3.5. Even more impressive was the effect of cimicifuga on the vaginal lining. Although both conjugated estrogens and the placebo produced little effect, a dramatic increase in the number of superficial cells was noted in the cimicifuga group. In a double-blind study of 110 women, cimicifuga extract (two tab- lets twice a day, providing a daily dose of 4 mg 27-deoxyactein) was shown to exert significant improvements in menopausal symptoms.8 In addition to providing relief of hot flashes, cimicifuga once again demonstrated impressive results on the vaginal lining, as confirmed by vaginal smear. In one study, 60 women less than 40 years old who had hysterectomies leaving at least one intact ovary received one of the following: cimicifuga extract (two tablets twice a day, providing a daily dose of 4 mg 27-deoxy- actein), estriol (1 mg/day), conjugated estrogens (1.25 mg/day), or estro- gen–progestin combination (Trisequens, one tablet a day).23 Although the hormone therapies produced better results as determined by a modi- fied Kupperman Menopausal Index, cimicifuga still displayed significant effects in relieving the symptoms of surgical menopause. These results indicated that cimicifuga could be a suitable alternative to estrogens in women having partial, and possibly even complete, hysterectomies. In a double-blind study, cimicifuga extract was evaluated for its effect on menopausal symptoms, bone metabolism, and on the endo- metrium compared with those of conjugated estrogen and placebo.24 The 62 postmenopausal women were treated with either black cohosh extract (40 mg/day), 0.6 mg conjugated estrogen, or matching pla- cebo for 3 months. Results indicated that the black cohosh extract was equipotent to conjugated estrogen and superior to placebo in reduc- ing menopausal complaints. Both black cohosh extract and conjugated estrogen produced beneficial effects on bone metabolism, but the black cohosh extract had no effect on endometrial thickness, which was sig- nificantly increased by conjugated estrogen. Vaginal superficial cells were increased with cimicifuga and conjugated estrogen treatment. These results seemed to confirm that cimicifuga extracts contain sub- stances with SERM activity (i.e., with desired effects in the brain/hypo- thalamus, bone, and vagina, but without exerting uterotropic effects).

## 513CHAPTER 66 Cimicifuga racemosa (Black Cohosh)

Women being treated with tamoxifen most often experience symp- toms similar to menopause. To examine the effect of cimicifuga extract on hot flashes caused by tamoxifen adjuvant therapy in young pre- menopausal breast cancer survivors, 136 breast cancer survivors (ages 35–52 years) who had been treated with segmental or total mastec- tomy, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen 20 mg/day orally or tamoxifen plus black cohosh extract (20 mg/day).25 The duration of treatment was 5 years for tamoxifen, according to international standards for adjuvant ther- apies, and 12 months for the black cohosh extract. Follow-up included clinical assessment every 2 months; the primary goal was to record the number and intensity of hot flashes. Results indicated that almost half of the patients getting the black cohosh extract were free of hot flashes. Only 24.4% of patients taking black cohosh extract experienced severe hot flashes compared with 73.9% of the women taking tamoxifen alone. An isopropanolic extract of black cohosh was reviewed in a prospective observational study carried out in 50 patients with breast cancer with tamoxifen treatment. Patients were treated with one to four tablets (2.5 mg each) for 6 months and recorded their complaints before therapy and after 1, 3, and 6 months of therapy.28 There was a statistically significant improvement in hot flashes, sweating, sleep problems, and anxiety, with 90% of participants reporting the tolera- bility of the black cohosh extract as good or very good. A 2007 randomized, double-blind, controlled 3-month study was done in China, enrolling 244 menopausal women.29 Women were assigned to either an isopropanolic extract of black cohosh contain- ing 40 mg/day or 2.5 mg/day tibolone. There was a significant trend (57.08%) in the finding that women given Remifemin responded bet- ter than tibolone in terms of efficacy–risk balance, and black cohosh was clearly superior to tibolone if the safety profile for abnormal bleed- ing, endometrial thickening, breast pain, vaginal discharge, and edema was followed. Studies indicated that black cohosh might produce ben- eficial effects on bone metabolism by stimulating osteoblasts and may also have a weak effect on maturation of vaginal cells.30,31 Five studies showed no effect on menopausal symptoms with black cohosh use, including no effect on cognitive function.32–36 Possible reasons included the use of an alcoholic extract versus an isopropa- nolic extract or the confounding health issues of the women studied. Studies also evaluated the combination of black cohosh and St. John’s wort. In one study, the mean Menopause Rating Scale score decreased 50% in the treatment group and 19.6% in the placebo group.37 The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score decreased 41.8% in the treatment group and 12.7% in the placebo group. In both mea- sures, the results in the group using the St. John’s wort and black cohosh were significantly superior to that of the placebo group. Another black cohosh/St. John’s wort trial was carried out in peri- menopausal or postmenopausal Korean women.38 Healthy perimeno- pausal women with typical climacteric symptoms and not on HRT for at least the previous 3 months were given a 264-mg tablet containing 0.364 mL of extract from black cohosh equivalent to 1 mg terpene gly- cosides and 84 mg of St. John’s wort extract with 0.25 mg hypericin. Forty-two women in the treatment group and 35 women in the pla- cebo group completed the study. Mean Kupperman index scores at 4 and 12 weeks were significantly lower in the treatment group (P ≤ 0.002). At the end of the study, the average decrease in the Kupperman index score was 20 points in the treatment group and only 8.2 points in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Vaginal dryness and low libido were two symptoms that did not improve, but the average hot flash score was significantly lower in the black cohosh/St. John’s wort group. Despite some studies demonstrating no benefit of black cohosh, a meta-analysis of all nine placebo-controlled studies published until 2013 confirmed the reliable efficacy of C. racemosa–based medicinal products for menopausal symptoms.39 The collective findings in black cohosh studies and long-term clinical anecdotal evidence on black cohosh indicate that it is most effective for menopause symptoms of day time or night time hot flashes, mood swings, sleep disorders, and body aches.


The dosage of cimicifuga is based on its content of 27-deoxyactein, which serves as an important biochemical marker to indicate thera- peutic effect. The dose of the cimicifuga extract used in the majority of clinical studies was 40 mg of black cohosh isopropanolic extract sup- plying 2 mg of 27-deoxyacteine twice daily. Approximate dosage rec- ommendations using other (nonstandardized) forms of C. racemosa are as follows: • Powdered rhizome: 1 to 2 g • Tincture (1:5): 4 to 6 mL • Fluid extract (1:1): 3 to 4 mL (1 tsp) • Solid (dry powdered) extract (4:1): 250 to 500 mg The German Commission E recommended that treatment with cimicifuga should be limited to 6 months (which is also the standard recommendation for HRT). However, this recommendation was made before detailed toxicology studies. Based on currently available data, cimicifuga is appropriate for long-term continued use.


The standardized extract of C. racemosa providing 1 mg of 27-deoxy- actein in 40 mg of extract per tablet has been used in Germany since 1956 and has a remarkable safety record. A comprehensive review including preclinical and clinical research in estrogen-sensitive pop- ulations, including women at risk for breast cancer and breast cancer survivors, as well as human cell lines most relevant to breast cancer, confirmed this safety record. No serious side effects have ever been reported.40 Cimicifuga offers a suitable natural alternative to HRT for menopause, especially when HRT is contraindicated (e.g., in women with a history of cancer, unexplained uterine bleeding, liver and gall- bladder disease, pancreatitis, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and fibrocystic breast disease). Because cimicifuga extract shows some, albeit weak, estrogenic activity, researchers sought to determine Remifemin’s effect on an established breast tumor cell line whose growth in vitro depends on the presence of estrogens. The results from these experiments showed no stimulatory effects, but rather inhibitory effects as well as an ability to promote apoptosis in these cells.41,42 Furthermore, combining black cohosh with tamoxifen was shown to potentiate the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen. In 2008 the Expert Committee of the U.S. Pharmacopeia’s Council of Experts did an updated review of safety information for black cohosh.43 Regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada, and Europe released statements and guidelines regarding the potential association between black cohosh products and hepatotoxicity. The committee analyzed human clinical case reports, adverse event reports, animal and toxicological data, historical uses, and regulatory status. Thirty reports on the use of black cohosh and possible liver damage were analyzed. All the reports of liver damage were considered to be possi- bly caused by black cohosh, and none were probable or certain. None of the animal toxicological or pharmacokinetic information revealed adverse information about black cohosh. The committee determined that the link between black cohosh and reports of liver damage was weak and “not of certain causality.” They cited incomplete case infor- mation, unknown products, confounding variables (e.g., alcohol use

or concurrent medications), preexisting risk factors for liver damage, and no animal data or pharmacological data pointing to a mechanism of action that would cause a concern. Results of two meta-analyses of black cohosh confirmed these conclusions, finding no evidence of liver toxicity.44,45 Despite these limitations, the increase in reports between 2002 and the present resulted in the committee’s recommen- dation that black cohosh products should have a label with a cau- tionary statement, which is a change from the Expert Committee’s previous decision.43 In 2012 black cohosh was nominated to the National Toxicology Program (NTP) for general testing by both the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences due to its widespread use and lack of human or animal studies in the pub- lished literature demonstrating its safety. In the study, female rodents (mice and rats) were given 0, 15 (rats only), 62.5 (mice only), 125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of black cohosh extract (BCE) by gavage for 90 days.46 BCE induced dose-dependent hematological changes consistent with a nonregenerative macrocytic anemia and increased frequencies of peripheral micronucleated red blood cells indicative of chromosomal and hematological changes in both species. Both the chromosomal damage and hematological effects were more severe in mice than rats. Although this study provided the first comprehensive assessment of the subchronic toxicity of BCE in rodents, direct extrap- olation of the results to humans is difficult because BCE preparations are variable natural mixtures of chemicals, with the potentially harm- ful compound(s) still unknown, and the dose used was significantly higher than a human subject would ingest. The lowest external dose that had an effect (62.5 mg/kg/day) was 125 times the recommended amount for daily human consumption (40 mg or ∼ 0.5 mg/kg/day for a 70 kg human). Another research group conducted a study to inves- tigate the potential of a functional cobalamin or folate deficiency as a possible explanation for the hematological changes observed in the NTP BCE subchronic toxicity study.47 Female mice were exposed to 1000 mg/kg BCE for 92 days. The study confirmed the previous find- ings from the NTP study, in that exposure to BCE caused a decrease in the red blood cell count with an increase in MCV and MCH. In addition, although folate and cobalamin levels were unchanged, two biomarkers that are used for diagnosis or confirmation of folate and cobalamin deficiencies, homocysteine and MMA, were both elevated. The authors concluded that these findings suggested a BCE-induced functional deficiency of cobalamin, and possibly folate.


As discussed previously, there is concern that black cohosh might harm the liver. Taking black cohosh along with medication that might also harm the liver requires proper monitoring.

conditions. Citicoline’s therapeutic effects in such conditions stem from its ability to: 1. increase the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the primary compo- nent of neuronal membranes. Beyond phosphatidylcholine action in maintaining phospholipid metabolism, one of its mechanisms of action is to restore and preserve the structure/function integrity of neuronal membranes after an acute ischemic stroke or brain dam- age from traumatic head injuries; 2. enhance acetylcholine synthesis, thereby ameliorating the symp- toms resulting from ischemic loss of cholinergic neurons; 3. promote the synthesis of several other membrane phospholipids, including phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, to contribute to the repair and regeneration of axons and synapses; 4. serve as agonists at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which play a critical role in maintaining normal cognition; and 5. prevent the accumulation of free fatty acids and generation of free radicals at the site of ischemia, thereby preventing the initiation of a proinflammatory cascade of events. However, as will be discussed in this chapter, citicoline has also been studied for its effects on eye health and visual function, substance abuse, infectious diseases, and metabolic diseases.

# BIOAVAILABILITY/PHARMACOKINETICS

The pharmacokinetics of an oral dose of 14C-labeled citicoline has been studied in humans. Administration of a single 300-mg dose to healthy adults was shown to have nearly complete absorption, with less than 1% of the labeled compound found in feces after a 5-day collection period. Absorption of citicoline gave rise to two chromatographic peaks in concentrations of radioactivity in plasma, the first at 1 hour and the second, larger peak at 24 hours after dosing. The main route of excretion was found to be via respiratory carbon dioxide, with sig- nificant excretion also occurring through urine. After 5 days, 16% of the administered dose was recovered, suggesting that the remainder was incorporated into tissues or was available for biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways.6 Fig. 67.3 reports the metabolic pathways of citicoline. A pharmacokinetic study in rats using 14C-methyl-labeled citico- line confirmed almost complete absorption with oral administration, with calculated oral bioavailability being approximately 92% of that obtained from intravenous (IV) dosing. The absorption was catego- rized as slow and complete with sustained blood levels, the highest being at around 5.5 hours after administration. Radioactive labeling found citicoline and its metabolites widely distributed throughout tissues, including distribution of metabolites to the brain, confirming their ability to participate in the synthesis of phospholipids.7 A confirmatory study, again using radiolabeled citicoline in rats, found 62.8% of total radioactivity was distributed in brain tissue as phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. These results suggested that metabolites of orally administered citi- coline were available in the brain for resynthesis of endogenous citi- coline.8 Although only a small percentage of the total citicoline dose crosses the blood–brain barrier as choline and cytidine, the utilization of these precursors in brain tissue for phospholipid biosynthesis is extremely efficient.4 A rapid liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the pharmacokinetic investigation of choline, the active metabolite of citicoline in human plasma.9 The method was effectively applied for evaluation in a study of the pharmacokinetic parameters and bioequivalence of citicoline administered to 12 healthy male volunteers.

# MECHANISM OF ACTION

Much remains to be learned of citicoline’s mechanisms of actions and biotransformation.10 Much of the evidence shows that citicoline is sequentially hydrolyzed and dephosphorylated to uridine (in humans) and choline. Citicoline has several important mechanisms of action, leading to a broad range of beneficial effects on neurological function. In cerebral ischemia, citicoline primarily acts by increasing the synthesis of phos- phatidylcholine, the primary neuronal membrane phospholipid, and enhancing the production of acetylcholine. Oral citicoline administra- tion increases plasma levels of choline and cytidine, which are building blocks used to restore neuronal membrane integrity.5 These effects, in addition to apoptosis inhibition, neuroplasticity potentiation, acetyl- choline (Ach) and phospholipid synthesis, contribute to our under- standing of the mechanism of action that has demonstrated beneficial effects both in degenerative and vascular cognitive decline. Interestingly, citicoline seems to have differential effects on phosphatidylcholine synthesis in younger versus older adults. Phosphatidylcholine is an essential compound for cell membrane integrity and repair. It is normally reduced in brain cell membranes as a result of aging. A study using protein magnetic resonance spectros- copy to measure brain concentrations of cytosolic choline-containing compounds before and after a single oral dose of citicoline found that the choline resonance in the brain of younger individuals increased, Citicoline CiticolinePhosphatidylcholine Cytidine CysteineGlutathione Cytidine triphosphate CTP- cytidylyltransferase 1,2-diacylglycerol Choline BetaineMethionineS-adenosyl-l-methionine S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine Phosphocholine Fig. 67.3 Metabolic pathways of citicoline.

## 517CHAPTER 67 Citicoline (CDP-Choline)

whereas it decreased in older subjects. It was presumed that the cyt- idine component of citicoline enhanced the incorporation of brain choline into neural cell membrane phosphatidylcholine in older sub- jects, resulting in the decrease.11 The ability of citicoline to stimulate brain phospholipid synthesis in humans was further supported by studies showing that healthy subjects consuming 500 mg/day orally of citicoline for 6 weeks had increased levels of phosphodiesters in brain tissue, such as glycerophosphocho- line and glycerophosphoethanolamine, as assessed by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These findings supported citico- line’s ability to increase phosphatidylcholine synthesis.12 Findings from a study of healthy middle-aged adults confirmed these results but suggested that the increase in phosphorus metabolites attributed to citicoline intake was regionally specific, with the frontal lobe being the preferred site of deposition, ultimately enhancing frontal lobe energet- ics and improving phospholipid membrane turnover. This area of the brain contributes to memory function by supporting vigilance, atten- tion, and working memory capacity and by reducing mental fatigue. Because citicoline’s effect was most prominent in this brain region, this is a likely explanation for its clinical benefit of improved cognitive function.13 Citicoline may further benefit patients experiencing ischemia by decreasing the accumulation of free fatty acids at the site of the lesion, which occurs as a result of neuronal cell damage and death. Soon after initiation of ischemia, there is a significant increase in proinflamma- tory arachidonic acid, glycerols, and free fatty acids, caused by the breakdown of neuronal membranes. Toxic metabolites, prostaglan- dins, thromboxanes, and free radicals, can accumulate, leading to fur- ther damage. Animal studies showed that intracerebral administration of citicoline before the induction of ischemia reduced the increase in free fatty acids, arachidonic acid, and other toxic metabolites, attenuat- ing free radical damage and restoring membrane function.5 Some evidence points to the ability of citicoline to normalize neurotransmitter release patterns. In conditions of cerebral hypoxia, which exist in ischemia, norepinephrine release may decrease, whereas the release of dopamine may increase. In several animal models, citico- line was shown to inhibit the impairment of neurotransmitter release in hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, citicoline administration to rats kept in a chronic hypoxic state reduced behavioral deteriorations and increased survival time. Additional studies found that citicoline was able to increase the dilation of blood vessels in animals with cerebral microcirculation injury, significantly increasing cerebral blood flow.4 Citicoline shows neural restorative effects, presumably via action on the dopaminergic system of the central nervous system. Rats with substantia nigra lesions were shown to regenerate nerve cells after treatment with citicoline, indicating its protective effect in this region. Further studies found that citicoline administration to rats increased striatal dopamine synthesis. Several other investigations in animal models yielded evidence of citicoline’s ability to enhance dopaminer- gic synthetic pathways.4 This was a result of the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase and inhibition of dopamine reuptake, which is related to citicoline’s activity on phospholipid synthetic pathways. Citicoline is also known to have effects on serotonin and norepinephrine.14 Studies in rats showed that citicoline improved learning and memory capac- ity and enhanced motor performance and coordination in aged rats. These findings provided further evidence for citicoline’s cholinergic activity.15 Studies have suggested that citicoline enhances the preservation of an inner mitochondrial membrane component known as cardio- lipin, which is important for the preservation of mitochondrial func- tion. Citicoline facilitates the preservation of sphingomyelin, which promotes signal transduction in nerve cells. Citicoline exhibits direct antioxidant effects; research has shown that it has an ability to stimu- late glutathione synthesis and the activity of the enzyme glutathione reductase. Furthermore, citicoline attenuates lipid peroxidation. These downstream effects may be attributable to citicoline’s larger func- tion of attenuating the activation of phospholipase A 2 , thus reducing inflammation in neural tissues and in general.16 Citicoline was shown to have direct free radical suppressive effects, as seen in animal models of transient cerebral ischemia, in which citicoline had a suppressive effect on hydroxyl radical generation.17 Citicoline may significantly affect brain-remodeling activity. In an animal model, citicoline treatment significantly increased the length and branch points of dendrites, which led to increased efficiency of sensory information processing.18 This mechanism of action could potentially account for a significant portion of citicoline’s neurore- storative functions. Diminished auditory sensory gating and associated cognitive defi- cits in schizophrenia have been studied relative to treatment with citicoline. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design involving oral administration of 500 and 1000 mg of citicoline to healthy volunteers assessed for auditory gating and for executive func- tion, improvements were seen at the low dose.19 The effectiveness of the lower dose of 500 mg was confirmed in a second study of schizo- phrenic patients using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. In this study the orally administered dose was 500, 1000, and 2000 mg. As was found in the study of healthy subjects, the 500-mg dose was found to have a demonstrated treatment effect in increasing the suppression of P50 event-related potential (ERP) consistent with an α -7 nAChR mechanism.20 Choline is a selective α 7-nAChR agonist. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers (mean age, 21.3 ± 0.99 years) were recruited to participate in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clini- cal trial to determine whether citicoline single dose administration of either 500 or 1000 mg would increase sensory gating and cognition. Citicoline exhibited changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) oscilla- tions similar to those reported with nicotinic agonists and was observed to improve gating (1000 mg) and suppression of the S2 P50 response (500 and 1000 mg), with the effect being selective for individuals with low gating (suppression) levels.21 These results have implications for cognitive treatments focused on specific functional roles such as cod- ing of sensory information and cognitive disorders related to cortical and thalamic structural pathologies at sites with the highest α 7-nAChR expression, seen in schizophrenia. The crossover trial also used EEG recordings to elucidate citicoline’s mechanisms of action 4 hours after a single administration of either dose. Citicoline enhancement in the brain was found to facilitate multiple mechanisms, among which is its ability to facilitate nicotinic cholinergic activity (i.e., altered expression of the α -7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [nAChR]).21 To evaluate citicoline induction of an oscillatory response profile associated with nicotinic stimulation, a resting-state EEG is acquired to test the hypothesis. This kind of study was carried out in a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 24 subjects, which showed that citicoline enhanced cognitive function.19

## Learning and Memory

Experiments in animals and humans provided evidence of citicoline’s ability to promote important cognitive processes, including learn- ing ability and memory functions. Clinical studies evaluating citico- line administration for cognitive enhancement have been conducted for several decades. A review of trials using citicoline as a treatment for senile alterations of memory in 1991 found significant benefits

in patients with cerebral insufficiency and chronic cerebrovascular disease.22 A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to assess the effects of citicoline supplementation on verbal memory function in 95 healthy subjects aged 50 to 85 years (47 women and 48 men) who were administered citicoline (500 mg orally twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The study subjects were well educated (mean, 14.3 years of education). Baseline testing included a logical memory assessment test, which was used to classify those with rela- tively inefficient memories. At the end of the initial study, 32 individu- als (16 from the citicoline group and 16 from the placebo group) from this pool were recruited to participate in a follow-up crossover study. The initial study found that citicoline improved delayed recall for only those with relatively inefficient memory at the beginning of the trial. In the follow-up crossover study, the dose of citicoline was increased to 2000 mg/day. In this subgroup, the higher dose of citicoline improved immediate and delayed logical memory.23 An open-label crossover trial consisting of 24 elderly individu- als without dementia but with demonstrable memory impairment (assessed by comparison with 24 healthy young control subjects), showed that oral citicoline (500, 1000, or 300 mg/day combined with nimodipine [90 mg/day]) significantly improved memory per- formance compared with the no-treatment periods, as evidenced by reduced error scores on word recall tasks, immediate object recall, and delayed object recall.24

## Attention

Attention and mental alertness play an important role in supporting cognitive function and performance. Attention is the cognitive pro- cess of selectively concentrating on discrete information. Paying atten- tion is the first step in the learning process, especially the ability to focus attention at the right time on what is important and simulta- neously ignoring irrelevant information occurring at the same time. Animal studies have shown that citicoline can enhance learning and memory.25,26 In a study using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to mea- sure in vivo brain chemistry, investigators found that 3 hours after a single oral dose of citicoline was given to participants, plasma choline levels increased in younger and older adults. These results are particu- larly important to older adults because in this study, the investigators found that intracellular cytidine levels increased after the administra- tion of citicoline, leading to increased incorporation of choline already present in the brain into membrane phosphatidylcholine.11 Citicoline may benefit healthy individuals by improving atten- tional ability. To test this hypothesis, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in 40- to 60-year old healthy females. Subjects were given either 250 or 500 mg/day for 28 days, or placebo. The groups receiving citicoline exhibited improved cognitive attentional performance by committing significantly fewer commis- sion errors on the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) compared with the placebo group.27 A similar study was performed in healthy male individuals ranging from 13 to 18 years of age, in which either 250 or 500 mg/day of citicoline was administered, or placebo, for 28 days. Significant improvements in attentional task and motor function were measured.28 In a study by Bruce and colleagues, when citicoline was combined with caffeine to create a citicoline-caffeine based beverage, a gener- alized improvement in the ability to accommodate new and relevant information within working memory and sustained attention was seen, in addition to overall enhanced brain activitation.29 The 8 ounces (227 g) of the beverage, containing 35 mg of caffeine and 250 mg of cit- icoline, or an identical placebo beverage without the caffeine-citicoline blend, was randomly given to 60 healthy adult participants (33 women and 27 men; M = 24.2) enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled trial. Both measures of electrical brain activity using EEG 30 minutes after consuming the beverage and neuropsycholog- ical measures were used to measure electrical brain activity and neu- ropsychological performance changes in working memory, attention, behavioral inhibition, and executive functioning. The observed increase in electrical brain activity seen in the Bruce study is in agreement with another study of a different beverage con- taining citicoline performed by the same lead author. In this study, 250 mg of citicoline was combined with lycopene, caffeine, and vita- min E.30 Ten healthy adults (five women and five men; aged 25–32, M = 28.1) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Subjects undertook a noninvasive EEG that measured concom- itant changes in ERPs in response to a range of cognitive tasks. The experimental activation tasks were designed to reflect the brain’s core adaptive competencies and underlying neural networks. Thirty min- utes after consuming 8 ounces of the beverage, EEG and ERP indices were significantly modified compared with the brains of the placebo group.

## Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia

Citicoline supplementation has been well studied in Alzheimer’s dis- ease and vascular dementia. A study of 19 patients (mean age, 66.21 ± 1.48 years) given oral citicoline at a dosage of 1000 mg/day for 30 days found significant improvements in cognitive function in the subgroup of patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease and a trend toward increased cognitive function in the overall group, as assessed by brain electrical mapping. Brain spectral data readings provided an indica- tion that the brains of early-onset Alzheimer’s patients showed greater damage than those of late-onset Alzheimer’s patients, whereas both groups had the same degree of cognitive impairment. It was postu- lated that the therapeutic effects of citicoline might be mediated by an enhancement of cholinergic neural transmission, activation of repair mechanisms to rejuvenate neuronal membranes, a regulatory effect on parameters associated with blood flow and circulation, and the regu- lation of several immunological responses, which, if left unchecked, would lead to potential neuronal dysfunction and cell death.31 In further studies, oral administration of citicoline (1000 mg/ day) to 20 patients (age range 57–78 years) with early- or late-onset Alzheimer’s disease resulted in improvements in mental function, particularly in the early-onset group. This 1-month treatment with citicoline resulted in an increased blood-flow velocity from baseline measures (assessed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound) in the middle cerebral artery, which has been found to decrease with age, possibly resulting in neuropathologic changes. Citicoline’s cholinergic effects and influence on cytokine production might also partially account for its benefits.32 Researchers investigated the regulatory effects of citicoline on blood histamine levels. Alterations in the histamine system are present in Alzheimer’s disease, and high levels have been found in several cen- tral nervous system regions, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum. Histamine may also participate in the aging process, with histamine-related changes reported in several different tissues, including the central ner- vous system. In one study, 14 individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (7 early onset, 7 late onset) were administered citicoline (1000 mg/day for 30 days). Blood histamine measurements were taken at baseline, at hours after administration of the first dose, and after 30 days of treat- ment with citicoline. All participants experienced an acute reduction in blood histamine levels; after 30 days, early-onset Alzheimer’s patients saw a decrease in blood levels of histamine of about 55% compared with baseline, whereas late-onset individuals saw a 45% decrease.

## 519CHAPTER 67 Citicoline (CDP-Choline)

Early-onset patients clearly had higher baseline levels of histamine than late-onset patients. Reducing endogenous histamine excesses may sup- port cognitive function because excessive histamine levels have been implicated in etiopathogenic events in Alzheimer’s disease.33 The effects of citicoline administration (1000 mg/day orally for 3 months) were assessed in a trial in patients with senile dementia (Alzheimer’s disease and multiinfarct dementia) to elucidate whether the nutrient was able to restore immune function and improve mental parameters. The study consisted of four groups: control subjects (n = 8), early-onset Alzheimer’s subjects (n = 11), late-onset Alzheimer’s subjects (n = 7), and multiinfarct dementia subjects (n = 10). After 3 months of treatment, citicoline supplementation improved men- tal performance in all groups (including controls), as assessed by several standard assessment tools (including the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression). Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s showed increased levels of interleukin-1 β at baseline. Citicoline administration normalized these levels in the early-onset Alzheimer’s group. The researchers concluded that citico- line showed benefit in senile dementia patients as a restorative and pal- liative treatment, improving vascular risk factors, stabilizing immune function, and improving mental performance.34 Further studies cor- roborated these effects of citicoline.35 Citicoline was further studied in a double-blinded, placebo-con- trolled randomized trial in 30 patients with apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E) genotyped Alzheimer’s disease. All 30 participants were categorized as having mild to moderate dementia. Citicoline (1000 mg/day orally) or placebo was administered daily for 12 weeks, and its efficacy was further evaluated on the basis of each of the individuals’ Apo-E gen- otype. The development of certain symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease is correlated with differing Apo-E genotypes. The results of the study showed that clinical interview-based impression of change scores wors- ened significantly in the placebo group, whereas a clear trend toward improvement in the citicoline group was observed. In those individu- als bearing the ε 4 allele of the Apo-E (Apo-E4), citicoline was found to induce significant improvements on the cognitive function sub- scale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale. Furthermore, sta- tistically significant improvements in Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale scores were found with citicoline administration in the subset of Apo-E4 patients with mild cognitive deterioration (as assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale scores of less than 5). An overall increase in cerebral blood flow velocity was also seen with citicoline compared with placebo, whereas beneficial changes were further noted in brain bioelectrical activity.36 Recently two clinical studies were published on the effect of citicoline coadministered with cholinesterase inhibitors. In a retrospective, multicenter case-control study in Italy, involv- ing 448 consecutive patients aged 65 years old or older affected with Alzheimer’s disease, 197 patients were treated with an AChEI and were treated with an AchEI + citicoline mg/day given orally. Patients treated with citicoline plus an AChEI showed a statistically significant increase in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and slowing disease progression.37 The CITIRIVAD study was a retrospec- tive case-control study on 174 consecutive outpatients aged 65 years or older affected with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or mixed dementia (MD). Of the 174 patients, 92 had been treated with rivastigmine + citicoline 1000 mg/day given orally; 82 patients had been treated with rivastigmine. Data show the effectiveness of combined administration versus the AchEI alone, mainly in slowing disease progression and con- sequently in disease management, both in AD and in MD.38 In a number of studies, coadministration of citicoline with prescrip- tion drugs has been proposed to lead to a greater increase in intrasynap- tic levels of Ach than when either is given alone. Such a demonstration was reported in a retrospective multicenter case-control study of patients aged 65 years of age or older with AD, of which 197 patients were treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and were given AChEIs and 1000 mg/day of citicoline orally. Multiple functional cognitive assessments showed significant improvements of the combined administration after 3 and 9 months compared with AChEIs alone.37 Similar results were reported in the CITIRIVAD study, a retrospective case-control study on 174 patients aged 65 years or older affected with AD or MD (mean age, 83.3 ± 4.5 yrs). In this study, 92 patients were treated with rivastigmine (an acetylcholines- terase inhibitor) and 1000 mg/day of citicoline, and 82 patients were treated with the ACHEIs alone. In both groups, a rivastigmine patch at the highest tolerated dosage had been used by the patients for at least 6 months. Multiple functional tests for cognition were administered to assess changes in both groups. The study found that the combination was well tolerated and that combined administration was effective in slowing disease progression and improving disease management.38

## Parkinson’s Disease

Citicoline may also benefit individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Citicoline was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection to patients (aged 52–76 years) at a dosage of 1000 mg/day for 15 days, followed by 500 mg/day for an additional 15-day period. (All of these patients received levodopa alone or in combination with other drugs before and during the trial.) The patients had improved scores on the Columbia Rating Scale (one of several validated and reliable rating tools for disability in Parkinson’s39) by 7.3%, and also had measurable improvements in rigidity, time to walk 10 meters, time to turn over, and handwriting test scores. Results from a self-assessment revealed that symptomatology was improved in 15 of the 20 patients, including improvements in speech, gait, posture, tremor, agility, and slowness of movements. Five patients showed minor improvements in dyskinesia; however, this was otherwise unaffected by citicoline treatment.40 Additionally, citicoline has a levodopa-sparing effect and an abil- ity to increase dopamine synthesis. In one trial, 85 Parkinson’s dis- ease patients were randomly assigned to two groups: patients received either their usual dose of levodopa (mean 381 mg/day) or half their usual dose (mean 196 mg/day). Both groups were simultaneously administered 1200 mg citicoline (400 mg orally three times daily); it was found that the group consuming half of their usual levodopa dose plus citicoline had significant improvements at week 6 (which was the end of the fourth week of citicoline administration) on the Webster Rating Scale, a measure of neurological and clinical symptoms. This trial indicated that citicoline has the ability to compensate for the reduction of levodopa dosage, potentially contributing to a reduction in side effects associated with long-term levodopa usage.41 A similar trial was performed in 30 individuals with Parkinson’s disease in which the participants were treated with levodopa and concomitantly received 500 mg of citicoline by IM injection daily for 30 days. Significant improvements in neurological signs were noted (including moderate improvements in facial expression and digital skill and marked improvements in the ability to rise from a seated position, posture, and gait) in addition to improvement in certain electrophysiologic parameters. An increase in dyskinesia was noted as a side effect in this group. In the second phase of the trial, the levodopa dosage was reduced by one-third. This decrease restored the incidence of dyskinesia to pretreatment levels, whereas the therapeutic response remained stable.42 An additional double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial, in which citicoline (500 mg/day IM) or placebo was administered to 30 Parkinson’s disease patients already on levodopa and a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor found that citicoline induced improvements in bradykinesia. There was a 26.97% improvement from baseline on the

Webster Rating Scale. This improvement was highly statistically signif- icant compared with baseline and compared with placebo. Significant improvements in rigidity were also noted with citicoline treatment, whereas no such improvement occurred with placebo.43

Stroke is one of the leading causes of physical disability and contrib- utor to vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia that can significantly affect a patient’s quality of life. Multiple trials have shown positive benefits after citicoline administration in patients who have suffered a stroke because of cerebrovascular ischemia.44 In one study, investigators conducted a multicenter, dou- ble-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral cit- icoline administration in patients who experienced an acute cerebral infarction. The study consisted of 272 patients with a confirmed diag- nosis of cerebral infarction and a mild to moderately impaired level of consciousness. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either mg/day of citicoline administered intravenously or a placebo for days. When these acute stroke patients were assessed at days 7 and 14, citicoline treatment resulted in significant improvements in the level of consciousness and neurological status.45 In a second multicenter, randomized trial conducted in the United States (the US Citicoline Stroke Treatment Study), positive results were reported for patients who experienced an acute stroke. Treatment was initiated within 24 hours of stroke onset with citicoline for 6 weeks, and patients were assigned to one of three dose groups that were administered either 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/day, then compared with a placebo group. The Barthel Index, an ordinal scale that assesses func- tional independence in stroke patients, was used as the primary out- come measure to assess functional improvement. In the 500-mg/day citicoline group, the odds ratio for improvement was 2.0, and in the 2000-mg/day group, the ratio was 2.1, signifying that individuals in these groups were twice as likely to achieve higher Barthel scores than those in the placebo group. Overall, the results showed that either or 2000 mg/day of citicoline significantly improved functional recov- ery after 6 weeks of treatment compared with placebo by the 12th week of follow-up. Interestingly, the group taking 1000 mg/day of citicoline did not show a comparable benefit. This was puzzling in that the base- line characteristics of each group were essentially identical, except for weight, which was higher in this group than in the other treatment groups. The authors postulated this might have played a role in the outcome, suggesting that a high dose may be needed for patients with a body-mass index (BMI) greater than 30.46 In a third multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in acute stroke patients, patients were given citicoline for 6 weeks and assessed according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale. No benefit was seen in terms of recovery, likely because of several significant confounding factors that affected the analysis, such as pop- ulating the placebo arm of the study with more patients with milder strokes.47 A larger Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was organized to assess the effectiveness of 2000 mg/ day of citicoline taken for 6 weeks to determine whether this dosage would facilitate an accelerated rate of stroke recovery. This study fea- tured recruitment from 118 stroke centers representing 899 patients randomized to receive either citicoline or placebo. Unlike earlier tri- als that assessed the efficacy of citicoline in moderate-stroke patients, this study recruited participants with NIH Stroke Scale scores of 8 or higher, characterized as having experienced a severe stroke. The major end point of this trial was a comparison of the proportion of individu- als with an improvement of 7 or more points on the NIH Stroke Scale by week 12. Although no significant differences were noted between groups using the NIH Stroke Scale, a benefit was seen for citicoline on the Barthel Index at 6 weeks; a significantly higher proportion of those in the citicoline group returned to baseline function by then.48 An international, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study, the International Citicoline Trial on Acute Stroke (ICTUS) trial, aimed to determine whether neurovascular protection and repair would improve the recovery of patients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke and received citicoline treatment. In this study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either citicoline or pla- cebo within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, after which they were given 1000 mg of citicoline every 12 hours intravenously in first 3 days after the stroke and orally thereafter for a total of 6 weeks. Of the patients, 1148 were assigned to the citicoline group versus placed in the placebo group. An analysis of the results found that global recovery was similar for both groups (odds ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.25; p = 0.364), and no significant dif- ferences were reported for adverse events.49 A subsequent critique of the study pointed out that patients in the ICTUS trial were older by years on average, had more severe strokes, and were more frequently treated with intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activa- tor to dissolve the clot to improve blood flow, along with heterogeneity among previous trials the ICTUS study compared itself to that could be a function of methodological and clinical differences and random error.49 In an updated meta-analysis of the ICTUS trial, the authors showed an overall significant effect of citicoline (odds ratio 1.14; 95% CI 1.00–1.30) and a significant heterogeneity of effects (p = 0.0029) between previous studies and the ICTUS trial.50 Hazama and colleagues conducted a double-blinded, placebo-con- trolled trial in 1980 to assess the effect of citicoline administration as an adjunct to regular rehabilitation in post-stroke recovery from hemi- plegia (paralysis of one side of the body).51 In their study, citicoline was administered once daily for 8 weeks to patients continuing reha- bilitation and assigned to one of three groups: a citicoline high-dose group (1000 mg/day IV), a citicoline low-dose group (250 mg/day IV), or placebo (isotonic saline). Upper and lower limb joint range of motion was assessed at intervals throughout the study, as were subjec- tive symptoms, neurological signs, and mental symptoms. Significant improvements were noted in functional recovery in the upper limb in all groups, with dose-dependent improvements noted in both of the citicoline groups, which were significantly superior to placebo by week 8. No significant differences were noted between groups in the lower limb, although both citicoline groups showed a slightly higher rate of improvement compared with the placebo.51 Citicoline was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled study consisting of 92 patients with chronic cerebrovascular conditions. Patients received 1000 mg/day of citicoline intramuscularly or a pla- cebo for two treatment cycles of 4 weeks, each with a 1-week interval between cycles. The study outcome showed that citicoline signifi- cantly improved attention ability, as seen by the decreased number of wrong responses on the Toulouse-Piéron Test for nonverbal stimuli. Furthermore, a constant and progressive improvement was noted with citicoline treatment on memory tests and emotional and behavioral assessments.52 Citicoline treatment of patients with hemorrhagic, nontraumatic cerebral infarction was found to enhance the recovery of muscular strength associated with recovery. A double-blind, randomized trial conducted with 32 study subjects assigned to receive either 250 mg of citicoline IV twice daily or a placebo for 14 days showed that compared with baseline, muscular strength in the citicoline group increased sig- nificantly more so than in patients receiving placebo.53 It is noteworthy to mention the editorial that appeared in 2006 in the Journal of Neurological Sciences that declared citicoline to be the first

clinically effective neuroprotective agent in acute ischemic strokes.54 The editorial recommended that citicoline be the agent of choice in trials of combination therapy for stroke with thrombolytic agents because of its safety profile and experimentally demonstrated efficacy in promoting recovery from ischemic conditions. This editorial fol- lowed by a year the review by the Cochrane Collaboration that ana- lyzed the outcomes from clinical trials using citicoline in the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms resulting from chronic cerebral conditions in the elderly, which concluded that citicoline showed ben- efits for improved memory function and behavior in elderly individu- als with chronic cerebral disorders.55 To assess the value of citicoline administration over longer periods of time, two open-label, randomized, parallel studies were performed that compared citicoline with conventional treatments for the treat- ment of ischemic stroke patients was undertaken. In the first study, subjects were selected 6 weeks after suffering a stroke and recruited for an open-label, randomized, parallel study into one of two arms that either received 1000 mg/day of citicoline for 12 months or a control group that did not receive the supplement. All subjects underwent a series of neuropsychological tests and evaluations at months 1, 6 and 12. Of 347 subjects, 172 received citicoline, and 175 served as controls. Cognitive function improved at 6 and 12 months after the stroke in both groups. In comparison with controls, the patients receiving cit- icoline showed improvements in attention-executive functions (p = 0.007) and temporal orientation (p = 0.045) at the 12-month fol- low-up.56 This study demonstrated that citicoline treatment for at least 12 months after an acute ischemic stroke is potentially effective and safe in preventing longer-term cognitive impairment in that citicoline treatment resulted in significant improvement in attention, executive function, and temporal orientation. In the second open-label, randomized, parallel trial, patients were selected 6 weeks after they suffered a stroke and randomized into par- allel arms. A series of neuropsychological examinations was performed at month 1, month 6, year 1, and year 2 after the stroke. Subjects in the study consisted of 163 patients who had suffered their first stroke. The mean age of subjects was 67.5 ± 10.5 years; 50.9% were females. After years, long-term citicoline use was associated with a greater quality of life and significantly improved cognitive status compared with patients receiving conventional treatments.57 For patients with subjective memory complaints and neuroradio- logical evidence of vascular lesions, a 9-month study was performed in 349 subjects (79.9 ± 7.8 years) to assess the effectiveness and safety of 500 mg of citicoline given twice a day to 265 individuals with mild vascular cognitive impairment or a control group of 84 nonsupple- mented patients (78.9 ± 7.01). Individuals recruited for the study with probable Alzheimer’s disease were excluded. The study found that cit- icoline was effective and well tolerated.58 Whereas the control group experienced a decline in scores over the 9-month period on the MMSE, used extensively to measure cognitive impairment, the citicoline group essentially remained unchanged over time, except for an insignificant increase of 0.5 points on the test. In summary, the evidence in support of citicoline in the treat- ment of stroke continues unabated, as discussed by Martynov and Gusev in the Journal of Experimental Pharmacology.59 In a review in the Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, a similar conclu- sion stated, “Citicoline is the only drug that in a number of difference clinical stroke trials that continuously had some neuroprotective ben- efit,” given its safety and beneficial effect in expediting the recovery of patients after experiencing an acute ischemic stroke.60 Nevertheless, administration of tissue plasminogen activators (tPAs) remains the preferred method of treatment for patients experiencing an acute ischemic stroke, and conventional medicine remains sufficiently unimpressed with the experimental evidence of the benefits of citico- line to recommend its use concomitant with tPAs and other therapeu- tic agents. Unfortunately, this attitude comes from reliance on several cumulative meta-analyses that dilute the evidence for citicoline’s ben- efits by mixing studies that are heterogeneous in dosage, administra- tion, inclusion criteria, and outcome measures.61,62 Nevertheless, the totality of evidence, when examining each study on citicoline’s treat- ment effect in stroke and cerebral ischemic patients, supports the use of citicoline for its neuroregenerative potential benefit in preventing post-stroke cognitive impairment.

## Traumatic Head Injuries

Traumatic head injuries are a major cause of long-term disability that may surpass many diseases as the major cause of death and neurobe- havioral disability. Research into the beneficial effects of citicoline for the treatment of traumatic head injuries and concussions has been ongoing for several years. Injuries to the head can result in decreased production of cell membrane phospholipids, resulting in an accumulation of intracellu- lar water that leads to edema and possible deterioration of the hema- toencephalic barrier. Citicoline can have therapeutic benefits in these conditions because it is a precursor for the synthesis of neuronal mem- brane phospholipids. A single-blinded randomized study assessing the administration of 1000 mg of intravenous citicoline given every 6 hours for 2 days, followed by 1000 mg every 8 hours thereafter on the third and fourth days, in addition to conventional therapy, was undertaken in patients with severe or moderate head injuries. The study found citi- coline to be superior to conventional therapy alone for 3 months after injury as assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale, along with a trend toward shortening hospital stays for severe head injury patients while at the same time improving motor, cognitive, and mental symptoms.63 The authors cited earlier research on citicoline in treating moderate to severe head injuries, which showed that citicoline increased the chances of recovery to a nondependent condition (including the abil- ity to walk and perform activities of daily living) in improving quality of life. Citicoline also improved levels of consciousness assessed at days after injury in traumatic coma patients while reducing the per- centage of patients showing focal neurological signs at 60 and 90 days postinjury.63 In a study comparing 67 patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury who received citicoline administration compared with matched patients who did not, patients receiving citicoline experi- enced significantly reduced rates of intensive care unit mortality (5% vs. 24%, p < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (9% vs. 24%, p = 0.035), 6-month mortality (13% vs. 28%, p = 0.031), and observed versus expected mortality (0.42 vs. 0.84).64 Citicoline therapy may also help alleviate postconcussional symp- toms, frequently associated with emotional disturbance of clinical pro- portions.65 In one randomized trial with 14 young adults (M = 25 yr in citicoline group; M = 20 yr in placebo group) with mild to moderate head injuries, participants were administered 1 g of citicoline orally or a placebo. Assessments included tests of memory function, fluency, and attention. Although results at 1 month did not reach statistical sig- nificance, the group given citicoline trended toward higher improve- ment in several categories at follow-up, including improvements in recognition memory, and a decrease in the incidence of headaches, dizziness, and tinnitus.66 A review article examining trials of citicoline for the treatment of traumatic head injuries, including in children as young as age 5, espoused the benefits of citicoline therapy for improving neurological signs and symptoms, increasing the level of consciousness, enhancing

recuperation, and facilitating electroencephalographic improvements. The review highlighted several trials related to traumatic coma patients treated with citicoline, which led to better recovery of motor function and walking ability compared with placebo. The overall results of these trials indicate that citicoline treatment reduced the duration of coma and the incidence and severity of mental and motor deficits associated with traumatic head injuries. Citicoline was also shown to be safe and well tolerated in patient populations of several age ranges with various types of traumatic head injuries.67 To determine the possible benefit of citicoline in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, a double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 58 subjects with a diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury to the head that had a score of 8 or greater on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Although mean GSC levels improved in both groups, the difference bordered on insignificant (p < 0.05). Noteworthy was the increase in fetuin-A (p = 0.012), a negative-phase reactant, and matrix Gla-protein (MGP; p = 0.046), a calcification inhibitor, both of which are calcification modulators.68 This outcome suggests that citicoline may have a protective effect against inflammation after vascular calci- fication secondary to traumatic brain injury by increasing serum levels of fetuin-A and MGP. In the randomized, double-blind Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (CORBRIT), 1231 patients attending eight level I trauma centers were given either citicoline or a placebo to determine its neuropro- tective properties to facilitate neurorepair after injury. Subjects were given either 2000 mg/day or placebo for 90 days. Functional and cog- nitive status were assessed, including the TBI-Clinical Trials Network Core Battery. Rates of improvement on the Glasgow Outcome Scale- Extended were similar for both groups, whereas other measures, such as the TBI Clinical Trials Network Core Battery (global odds ratio 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83–1.15) showed no difference between groups. The use of citicoline compared with placebo did not result in an improvement in functional or cognitive status.69 Although the COBRIT study’s out- come would not encourage the clinical use of citicoline in the treat- ment of patients with traumatic head injuries, it is important to keep in mind that there is insufficient evidence to support pharmacological treatments relying on drugs such as modafinil, atomoxetine, rivastig- mine, and monoamine stabilizers; they have been found to be no more effective or better than placebo.70 Hence, given the compelling evidence I support of citicoline’s neuroprotective properties, consid- eration for its use is warranted for traumatic head injuries, especially when considering the evidence of its safety.

# EYE HEALTH AND VISUAL FUNCTION

Several trials with citicoline showed beneficial effects on eye health, specifically in cases of amblyopia and glaucoma. Amblyopia, or lazy eye, is the leading cause of decreased visual acuity in children, resulting in poor depth perception. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in U.S. adults and is a group of conditions resulting in damage to the optic nerve, usually as a result of elevated intraocular pressure.

## Amblyopia

Amblyopia is a condition whose prevalence ranges between 1% to 5% of the population. The possibility that citicoline may be useful in the treatment of amblyopia is based on several studies that used citicoline in the treatment of this eye condition.71 In one study, 80 subjects were recruited to undergo amblyopia therapy with a Bangerter 0.8 filter or the filter with oral citicoline. Forty-eight of the subjects had exodeviation of the eyes, a type of stra- bismus in which the visual axes diverge, and 32 had esodeviation, char- acterized by a reduction in the vision of one or both eyes. Treatment with citicoline was administered daily, 5 days a week, for 12 months. After 1 year, those subjects who received citicoline along with the filter experienced a more rapid increase in visual acuity, along with reduced recovery time and improved visual acuity. This led the authors of the study to conclude that by combining the use of the filter with citicoline, both visual acuity and visual evoked potential latency improved, most likely because of enhanced transmission of the electric impulses from the retina to the visual cortex.72 An open trial and a pilot double-blinded follow-up study were con- ducted to assess the possible benefits of citicoline therapy in patients with amblyopia. The open trial consisted of 50 patients (mean age, 16.6 years) who were administered citicoline (1000 mg/day IM) for 15 days. The visual acuity of both eyes was tested 1 week after the initiation of treatment and continuing at weekly intervals for the first month, and then on a monthly basis for an additional 6 to 18 months. For the double-blinded portion of the study, 10 patients were divided into two groups: 1 group received citicoline (1000 mg/day IM), and the other group received placebo. Citicoline improved visual acuity in 92% of the patients in the open study. Improvements were noted in both the sound and amblyopic eyes and were highly statistically significant. In the double-blinded study, significant improvements were noted between groups, with the citicoline group showing enhanced visual acuity.73 Another trial of citicoline took place in 45 children with amblyopia aged 5 to 9 years old. Participants were divided into three treatment groups: group A received 500 mg of citicoline daily via IM injection for 10 days every 6 months; group B received the same dosage of citicoline as group A in combination with 1 hour of occlusion (of the sound eye) per day; and group C received daily occlusion therapy alone. Although visual acuity improved in all groups at the end of the treatment period, treatment with citicoline was found to enhance the effect of occlusion therapy. Visual acuity improved in 73% of participants in group A, 86.6% of group B, and 66.6% of group C.74 An open-label trial with oral citicoline (800–1200 mg/day of citico- line according to body weight for 30 days) plus partial occlusion ther- apy in 61 children (aged 5–10 years) found that citicoline contributed to stabilizing the gains obtained during the treatment period when assessed at the 60-day posttreatment follow-up visit. Those receiving occlusion therapy alone showed a decrease in visual acuity gains at the 60-day follow up, whereas those in the citicoline group maintained the gains achieved with occlusion therapy.75 A randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of the addi- tion of citicoline to patching in the treatment of amblyopia in the age group of 4 to 13 years. Patients received patching therapy until achiev- ing a plateau. Thereafter, one group received citicoline plus patching while a second group continued on patching therapy. The primary outcome measurement was visual acuity on the logMAR chart, used to estimate visual acuity, after 12 months. The improvement in visual acuity with citicoline plus patching was significantly more than that with patching alone after 1 year of treatment.76 Citicoline likely influences improvements in visual acuity in amblyopic individuals by stimulating the availability of several neu- rotransmitters and neuromodulators. It also enhances the activity of endogenous dopamine while improving vascular aspects of neurolog- ical function.77

## Glaucoma

Lulia and colleagues have reviewed the neuroprotective benefits of cit- icoline on glaucomatous disease and the retina,78 and the review by Roberti and colleagues provides a critical summarization of the evi- dence for the use of citicoline in the treatment of glaucoma.79 Included among the studies reviewed is a randomized, placebo-controlled,

clinical trial evaluating the effects of citicoline in 40 patients with open-angle glaucoma who received either daily IM injections con- taining 1000 mg of citicoline or placebo for 60 days. Citicoline significantly improved visual evoked potential (a measure of bioelec- trical activity of the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli) and the pattern-electroretinographic (used to evaluate the functional integrity of the innermost retinal layers) parameters compared with placebo. Patients in the citicoline group were then divided into two age-matched groups after a 120-day washout period. In one of these groups, the washout period was extended for an additional 120 days, whereas the second group received a further 60-day treatment of citicoline. This second group showed further improvements in visual evoked potential and pattern-electroretinographic parameters, indicating citicoline’s ability to enhance retinal function and visual cortical response in glau- coma patients.80 A double-blind RCT assessing the benefits of citicoline in glaucoma patients confirmed that administration of citicoline for 60 days (1000 mg/day IM) was superior to placebo and significantly improved reti- nal function and cortical bioelectrical responses. This particular trial included an analysis of 8 years of follow-up data.81 A review examining the potential mechanisms through which cit- icoline exerts its beneficial influence in glaucoma patients theorized that citicoline’s ability to enhance the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and other cell-membrane phospholipids could explain its observed improvements. Glaucoma is considered a neurodegenerative disease in which the pathology extends to retinal ganglion cells. The death of these cells is likely a result of apoptotic mechanisms. The enhancement of phosphatidylcholine synthesis as a result of citicoline intake coun- tered the neuronal apoptotic mechanisms associated with glaucoma that conferred neuroprotection.82 The use of citicoline eye drops has also been investigated, starting with its encouraging effects on the vitreous and retina of animals,83 after which human clinical trials did not take long to begin. In one trial that enrolled 34 patients, citicoline was found to delay the progres- sion of glaucoma using a 1% and 2% administration of citicoline drops three times a day in the eye. In another trial, 53 patients were enrolled (47 completed the trial) with open-angle glaucoma (mean age 52.4 ± 4.72 years) and were treated with topical citicoline (3 drops/day) over a 2-month period and compared with 23 patients treated with beta- blocker monotherapy. Whereas the group treated with beta blockers showed no improvement, patients treated with citicoline drops experi- enced an improvement in both retinal bioelectrical response (increase of pattern electroretinogram) and bioelectrical activity of the visual cortex.84 The conclusion of the investigators of both trials was that topical citicoline administered as drops in the eye had neuroprotective bioactivity. That citicoline drops might significantly slow down the rate of progressive glaucoma was studied in 41 patients with a diagnosis of progressing glaucoma. The patients were given citicoline drops for years, during which time visual field examinations were performed. After 2 years, the mean rate of progression was slowed and there was an increase in intraocular pressure, resulting in the investigators concluding that, “citicoline might significantly slow down glauco- matous rates of progression.”85 Frolov and colleagues administered the combined oral administration of 1000 or 500 mg/day of citicoline in patients with open-angle glaucoma with 10 days of intravenous citicoline. Following this treatment protocol, both dosage groups experienced improvements in visual function, perimetry, morpho- metric retinal tomography, and life quality. The authors believe the improvement seen in patients could be attributed to a decrease in apoptosis, supporting the evidence that citicoline is an ocular neuro- protective agent.86

## Ischemic Optic Neuropathy

Nonarteritic ischemic neuropathy is an irreversible ischemic event associated with the intraocular optic nerve. The condition occurs acutely and painlessly, yet it induces a loss of visual acuity and visual field. In a pilot study designed to assess citicoline’s effect on this con- dition, 26 patients with at least a 6-month history of nonarteritic isch- emic optic neuropathy were divided into two groups: one received treatment consisting of oral citicoline (1600 mg/day) for 60 days, whereas the second group received no treatment. After the 60-day treatment cycle, there was a washout period of 120 days. After this, a second period of treatment with citicoline for 60 days was instituted in the original citicoline group. A third group of 14 age-matched healthy subjects provided control data. At the end of treatment, statistically significant improvements were noted in visual evoked potential, visual acuity, and pattern-electroretinographic parameters in the citicoline group compared with pretreatment values, whereas no such changes were observed in the untreated group of nonarteritic ischemic neurop- athy subjects.87

## Substance Abuse

Citicoline has been considered as an adjunct treatment for cocaine dependence by researchers in the field in recent years. The justification for its use stems from citicoline’s ability to repair neuronal membranes, which are damaged by cocaine use, and its ability to increase central nervous system dopamine levels, attenuating cravings for cocaine and other abused substances.88 A small double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 14 subjects with a history of cocaine dependence found that oral citicoline (500 mg twice per day for 14 days) caused no adverse events and also atten- uated some measures of cocaine craving and drug use.89 An additional experiment in eight healthy occasional cocaine users investigated the influence of citicoline pretreatment on cocaine-induced cardiovascular and behavioral effects and plasma levels of cocaine. The primary outcome measure was to determine the safety of coadministration of citicoline with cocaine. Because citico- line did not adversely affect cardiovascular end points associated with acute cocaine intake, the use of citicoline in this patient population was presumed safe. Although citicoline did not block the acute subjective effects of cocaine use, cocaine users experienced a higher incidence of major cerebrovascular events. Thus the authors speculated that citico- line could play a role in attenuating these undesirable consequences of cocaine use, although further studies are needed to investigate these potential benefits.90 These studies have had mixed results to date. The possibility that citicoline could be used in the treatment of cocaine dependence was studied in 29 subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Cocaine-dependent outpatient participants were given either 500 mg twice daily of citicoline or placebo for 8 weeks. Citicoline had no effect on reducing cocaine craving or total use.91 In contrast, a placebo-controlled study of 130 outpatients with bipolar 1 disorder (depressed or mixed mood state) and cocaine dependence found a significant reduction in cocaine dependence, which, however, diminished over time.92 Also of interest was the study’s completion rate, which favored the citicoline group (71% compared with 57% on placebo). Methamphetamine dependence is a major public health problem. Because citicoline may decrease cocaine craving,89,93 a preliminary study of citicoline treatment for methamphetamine dependence was conducted. Sixty participants with bipolar or unipolar depression and methamphetamine dependence participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were given either 2000 mg/day of citicoline orally (n = 28) or a placebo (n = 20) for weeks. Changes in mood state were assessed by several psychometric

instruments that found it had a measurable antidepressant effect.94 However, despite a doubling of completion rates in the citicoline group, no differences were seen in drug use or other cognitive outcomes. Individuals with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk for sub- stance abuse, with cocaine use being particularly common in this condition. Both the disorder and cocaine use are associated with mood symptoms and cognitive deficits. Given these commonalities, a 12-week double-blinded randomized control trial was conducted to assess the effect of citicoline supplementation on 44 individuals with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Citicoline resulted in an improvement in some aspects of declarative memory. However, no evidence for antidepressant properties was seen with the use of citico- line. There was also a significantly lower probability of a positive urine test for cocaine at the end of the study in the citicoline group.95 Although the legalization of medical marijuana is becoming wide- spread, along with the legalization of recreational marijuana in a num- ber of states in the United States, there is concern that habitual use of marijuana can affect frontal/executive function in adolescents and young adults96,97 and in long-term heavy users seeking treatment.98 Because recreational marijuana use has been reported to be associated with a range of cognitive impairments and changes in brain struc- ture and function, particularly after early-onset exposure (age 15 and earlier), a study was conducted to see if executive functioning, sus- tained attention, and impulse control would improve after 8 weeks of treatment with oral citicoline in a randomized, double-blind, place- bo-controlled trial.99 The study found that among 30 participants who received 2000 mg/day of citicoline or a placebo for 8 weeks, and who met eligibility criteria, of which 19 completed the study, those receiving citicoline demonstrated significantly lower levels of behavioral impul- sivity, improved task accuracy on two measures of inhibitory function, and different patterns of brain activation patterns than those who received placebo. The later improvement in brain activation was based on a comparison of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results of the anterior cingulate cortex, a region critical to inhibition processing. Other changes noted in the scans from baseline to 8 weeks of citicoline treatment included a shift from posterior/midcingulate to genual cingulate activation that corresponded with a reduction in total voxel cluster size. No activation in genual or near-genual regions was seen in the placebo group over the same time period.

## Infectious Diseases

A recently published article highlighted the role citicoline might play as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for the treatment of disease arising from an infectious etiology. The pathology of infectious disease involves dysregulation of the host immune response. Although currently avail- able treatments target the infectious agent, they do little to address the concurrent neurological abnormalities. These consequences, if unad- dressed, lead to eventual mortality in a high percentage of cases. In the case of cerebral malaria, studies highlighted cytokine-induced endo- thelial inflammation and the compromised blood–brain barrier as major pathological factors leading to the associated neurological signs and symptoms. Ischemia is a large underlying mechanism for damage in sepsis and cerebral malaria. Because these underlying issues are sim- ilar to conditions such as stroke and myocardial infarction, it is likely that citicoline would benefit these patients as an adjunct treatment for sequelae of sepsis and cerebral malaria.2

## Appetite Control and Satiety

Given citicoline’s ability to enhance cognitive function, confer neuropro- tection, and support neuroregenerative effects, and its action to support dopaminergic activity in the brain, researchers investigated the poten- tial of citicoline administration for controlling appetite and promoting satiety. In this particular study, the effect of 2000 mg/day of oral citicoline given orally for 6 weeks was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate cortico-limbic responses to images of various foods, along with subjective ratings of appetite and measures of weight. Sixteen healthy adults (age range of 40–57 years and a BMI range of 20.1–38.6 kg/ m2) were included in the study. Eight participants were assigned to the 500-mg/day citicoline group, and the other eight were assigned to mg/day. The results of this study indicated that self-assessment ratings for appetite declined significantly between visits in both groups, with the mag- nitude of decline in the high-dose group reaching statistical significance. No significant between-group differences were noted for the magnitude of weight change. The high-dose citicoline group also showed higher activa- tion within the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and left amygdala during visual perception of high-calorie foods than the low-dose group when assessed by fMRI. This might indicate that high-dose citicoline leads to appetite suppression and feelings of satiety by increasing the responsive- ness of these regions to images of calorie-rich foods.100

## Mental Health

Citicoline’s influence on cognitive capacity and neurological health, including modulatory activity on neurotransmitter production and function, make it a logical choice to support mental health and cog- nitive functioning. To evaluate the effect of citicoline administration in eight depressed patients, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to test its effectiveness as an adjuvant therapy in the treat- ment of major depression. In the study, patients were given 500 mg/ day IM, as 300 mg at 8 am and 200 mg at 5 pm, for 21 days or longer. On the day preceding the beginning of treatment, plasma growth hor- mone was measured, levels of which indicated reduced growth hor- mone secretion in these patients. Significant improvements were noted in seven of eight participants (treatment was discontinued in one par- ticipant because of a noted suicidal tendency) when assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression. Although the study was small, the results indicate the potential for significant benefit from citicoline therapy in depressed individuals.101 Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was assessed to determine whether 100 mg of citicoline taken twice a day for 6 weeks would alleviate depressive symptoms.102 Fifty patients with major depressive disorder who were under treatment with citalopram were recruited for the study. Significantly greater improvement was observed in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores in the citicoline group compared with the placebo group over a 6-week period (p = 0.021). Citicoline was demonstrated to be an effective adjuvant to cit- alopram in the treatment of major depressive disorder. In a preliminary study that examined the therapeutic effect of a combination of citicoline with galantamine for the treatment of schizo- phrenic patients, the results were encouraging. Evidence to date sug- gests that α 7-nicotinic choline receptors have decreased functionality in schizophrenia. Because citicoline provides choline, a known α 7-nic- otinic choline-receptor agonist, and galantamine is a modulator of α 7-nicotinic choline receptor function used to enhance the efficiency of choline binding to these receptors, it seemed reasonable to observe whether the combination would be of greater therapeutic value than either alone. To find out, a pilot study was conducted that included six schizophrenic patients given 2 g/day of citicoline in combination with 24 mg/day of galantamine daily in a 12-week open-label study. The combination proved to be well tolerated by all participants, with only minor transient side effects. No adverse cardiovascular events were reported. Five of the six participants had lower-than- baseline diastolic blood pressure readings at the end of the study, which was an unex- pected benefit. Other improvements noted in five of six patients were

seen on the Clinical Global Impressions Inventory and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores and Clinical Global Impressions severity scale scores decreased over the study period, providing encouraging results suggesting that the combination therapy was potentially effective.103

## Metabolic Diseases

Only recently has citicoline been the subject of investigations for its thera- peutic potential in glucose management for patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with a risk of potentially severe hypoglycemic episodes. The ability of citicoline to reduce neuronal death associated with such episodes has been demon- strated previously in animal studies.104,105 An animal study showed that when citicoline is given by injection, it can significantly increase acetyl- choline levels in the hippocampus after induction of severe hypoglycemia by insulin, suggesting that it could be used in the treatment of hypoglyce- mia-induced brain injuries.106 In another animal study, the combination of S-Methylisothiourea (a selective iNOS inhibitor) and citicoline, alone or in combination, was investigated on neuropathic pain in the rat with type 2 diabetes mellitus because neuropathy is a common complication. Citicoline, and the combination, significantly attenuated the diabetic neuropathic pain associated with decreased nerve conduction velocity, mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, and cold allodynia.107


Clinical investigations using citicoline revealed a favorable safety pro- file, with few reports of any major adverse events. The most common adverse reports were related to digestive disturbances. Citicoline has also been found to have a lack of significant adverse events in children, as evidenced by its use in clinical trials with pediatric subjects with amblyopia74 and children with traumatic head injuries.67 Citicoline has undergone several toxicological evaluations in multi- ple animal species and has proven to have a high level of safety. Single- dose acute oral toxicity studies were performed in mice and rats, with a median lethal dose of 27.14 g/kg in mice and 18.5 g/kg in rats. Chronic oral toxicity tests in dogs (1.5 g/kg per day for 6 months) and sub- chronic intraperitoneal dosing studies in rats (1 g/kg per day for weeks) showed no abnormal signs.14 An acute 14-day study and a 90-day subchronic toxicity evaluation of citicoline in rats revealed that the supplement was well tolerated. In the 14-day study, a single dose of 2000 mg/kg showed no abnormalities, and in the 90-day repeated oral dosing study, doses of 100, 350, and mg/kg per day resulted in no mortality in the animals. In male rats, slight increases in serum creatinine were noted in the two highest-dose groups, whereas in female rats, a dose-related increase in renal tubular mineral- ization was noted and attributed to an increase in phosphorus intake as a result of high citicoline consumption. Mineralization in female labo- ratory rats of all universally used strains is a common incidental finding as a result of a decreased calcium/phosphorus ratio in the diet. Because citicoline yields a significant amount of phosphorus—thus influencing the calcium/phosphorus ratio—this finding was not unexpected.108 A drug surveillance study was recently published examining the efficacy and safety of oral citicoline intake in acute ischemic stroke. The study of 4191 Korean patients confirmed a high level of safety for citicoline (500–4000 mg/day for 6 weeks or longer) with an incidence of 37 adverse events in 31 patients (only 0.73% of patients experi- enced adverse events). Adverse events in all but 1 of the 31 patients showed no relationship to citicoline administration. Thirty-two of the 37 (nearly 84%) patients reported events resolved over a mean of 9 days after onset. Furthermore, no dose-related effects of citicoline on the occurrence of adverse events were noted. The most frequent side effects included minor nervous system–related complaints (n = 8; numbness, headache, tingling sensations) followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 5; abdominal discomfort, diarrhea).109 There remains limited information on the long-term use of citico- line in healthy individuals. What few transient side effects are reported in the literature have been minor and reportedly resolved over time. No reliable information to support the safety of citicoline supplemen- tation in pregnant or breastfeeding women has been reported.


Effective dosing of citicoline based on data from clinical trials ranges from 500 to 2000 mg/day. Based on evidence from trials in children as young as 5 years of age,67,74 citicoline is safe for use in pediatric and adult populations. Oral doses of up to 1200 mg/day have been used in children.75 Studies using oral, IM, and IV dosing of citicoline in chil- dren and adults, with minimal occurrence of adverse events, affirmed its high level of safety. Because citicoline activates the biosynthesis of phospholipids in neuronal membranes and has neuroprotective effects during ischemia and hypoxia, the safety of oral administration of 500 mg of citicoline twice a day was of primary interest to investigators conducting the multicenter Italian studio di intervento nel decadimento vascolare lieve (IDEALE study) to assess the its effectiveness in 122 men and women (mean age 79.9 ± 7.8 yrs) with mild vascular cognitive impair- ment. No adverse events were reported or recorded.110


There are no reports of adverse drug interactions associated with the use of citicoline. Citicoline does have a levodopa-sparing effect of minimal clinical significance, given its potentiating benefits in reducing certain side effects associated with long-term levodopa or carbidopa use.41–43

# CONCLUSIONS

Until recently, citicoline was only perceived to be a novel compound with a broad spectrum of benefits in conditions associated with neu- rological disorders and dysfunctions. This seemed reasonable in that citicoline acts at multiple levels to support and maintain neural health to support optimal cognitive function. It also promotes cholinergic and dopaminergic functions, supports phospholipid synthesis and its incorporation into cell membranes, and enhances antioxidant mech- anisms in the body while suppressing the damaging effects of free radicals on neural tissue, facilitating anti-inflammatory activities, and facilitating the release of essential neurotransmitters. Given its wide- spread activity on neural tissue, citicoline should be considered a com- prehensive therapeutic agent for supporting brain health. Its broader clinical applications are growing beyond that of a neurore- generative and neuroprotective agent. Citicoline treatment of conditions affecting the eye and visual functioning is an example of new therapeu- tic applications for this compound in ophthalmology. More research is needed on its potential to dampen the adverse effects of substances of abuse, such as cocaine and amphetamines. Recent interest in its attri- butes in treating metabolic diseases has just begun and awaits results. That citicoline is safe is supported by overwhelming evidence based on its use in dozens of controlled clinical trials, regardless of outcomes.

## Deficiency

Inherited CoQ 10 deficiency has been associated with five major clinical phenotypes: (1) encephalomyopathy, (2) severe infantile multisystemic disease, (3) cerebellar ataxia, (4) isolated myopathy, and (5) nephrotic syndrome. In a few patients, pathogenic mutations have been identified in genes involved in the biosynthesis of CoQ 10 (primary deficiencies) or in genes not directly related to CoQ 10 biosynthesis (secondary deficien- cies). Respiratory chain defects, reactive oxygen species production, and apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of primary CoQ 10 deficien- cies.8,9 Considered quite rare, as of 2018, only 200 patients belonging to 130 families have been described in the medical literature.10 However, an analysis published in 2017 using large-scale gene sequencing data estimates as many as ∼ 124,000 individuals are likely to be affected worldwide ( ∼ 1500 in the United States), with a minimum of 1665 if limited to known pathogenic variants (192 in the U.S.).11 Acquired CoQ 10 deficiency is less well established. There are at least two major factors that lead to deficiency of CoQ 10 in humans: reduced biosynthesis, and increased utilization or need by the body. The typical dietary intake of CoQ 10 is 3 to 5 mg,12 so dietary lack is probably not a significant contributor to CoQ 10 deficiency. As mentioned previously, endogenous synthesis is a multistep process that can be affected by aging, disease status, and various medications. Some chronic disease conditions (cancer, heart disease, etc.) are associated not only with reduced biosynthesis but also increased demand for CoQ 10 . Even a persistent food intolerance or allergy has been linked to an acquired CoQ 10 deficiency, at least among children.13 Additionally, a number of mitochondrial diseases may increase the degradation of CoQ 10, pos- sibly by generating excessive reactive oxygen species as a result of a dysfunctional respiratory chain.14 Measurements of plasma CoQ 10 levels have been used to detect deficiencies and are by far the most common clinical assessment of CoQ 10 status.15 Normal plasma levels are believed to range from 0.45 to 1.5 mcg/mL (or 0.46–1.78 μ mol/L), with 93% to 100% being the reduced form, ubiquinol.15,16 However, plasma measurement of CoQ 10 has been criticized as having poor sensitivity (most patients with a pri- mary CoQ 10 deficiency still have normal plasma levels), and influenced by differences in plasma lipoprotein levels (which are CoQ 10 carriers) and dietary intake.17 Some studies use a functional assessment using an assay that measures the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) enzyme succinate A B C Mevalonate pathway Cholesterol Non-cholesterol pathway prenylation of small GTPase steroid hormones vitamin D bile acids geranylgeranylation Geranylgeranyl-PP farnesylation DolicholUbiquinone Farnesyl PP 2 Acetyl-CoA

dehydrogenase-CoQ 10 reductase.18 CoQ 10 acts as a critical coenzyme to this enzyme, so if the enzyme is fully saturated with CoQ 10 in vivo, addition of exogenous CoQ 10 does not increase enzyme activity. Nonetheless, muscle biopsy remains the best option for determining CoQ 10 status in mitochondrial disorders, though additional methods for assessing CoQ 10 status are also becoming available.8,19,20 Leukocyte and skin fibroblasts, for example, appear to reasonably approximate muscle levels, though they are not widely available clinically, and uri- nary tract CoQ 10 has emerged as a noninvasive technique for deter- mining renal CoQ 10 status.21,22

## Absorption and Pharmacokinetics

After gastric emptying, CoQ 10 is absorbed along with other lipids as chylomicron particles in the small intestine. The primary site of uptake of exogenous CoQ 10 is the duodenum, followed by the colon, then the ileum, and then the jejunum. Absorption in the ileum and colon regions supports the possibility of an enterohepatic recirculation of CoQ 10 . This possibility is further strengthened by the presence of a sec- ond peak in plasma levels about 24 hours after administration of either ubiquinone or ubiquinol. Absorption appears to be a complex process involving both active and passive mechanisms. In the liver, CoQ 10 is incorporated with lipoproteins and released into the blood. In plasma, CoQ 10 is almost totally associated with lipo- proteins, where it has greatest affinity for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL cholesterol. The CoQ 10 is then distributed to periph- eral tissues for uptake by cells and their mitochondria.

## Commercial Forms and Dosage Considerations

Commercially CoQ 10 is primarily produced via a yeast fermentation process using Schizosaccharomyces pombe. An alternate source of manufacturing is chemical synthesis using solanesol isolated from the tobacco plant. A very important consideration in the clinical application of CoQ 10 is its pharmacokinetics. CoQ 10 as ubiquinone is a crystalline powder that is insoluble in water and has poor absorption characteristics as a result. Ubiquinol has greater solubility and has been promoted as having greater bioavailability that ubiquinone,7,23 but there are limited data currently available and many questions remain to be answered, because ubiquinol is easily oxidized to ubiquinone and absorption studies to date have been suspect. Ubiquinone has an extensive history of use, particularly in oil-based soft-gelatin capsules. Several technol- ogies are now used to enhance the bioavailability of ubiquinone, such as particle size reduction (nanonization) and solubility enhancement via use of emulsifying agents, carriers, and self-emulsifying systems.24 For example, complexing ubiquinone to a soy peptide (BioQ 10 SA) has shown exceptional bioavailability because the soy peptide emulsifies the CoQ 10 and helps usher it into the bloodstream.25 Given the excel- lent absorption of this form of ubiquinone, the advantage of ubiquinol over regular ubiquinone appears to have more to do with its improved solubility than because it is in the ubiquinol form. In light of the pharmacokinetic issues, proper clinical dosing is yet to be determined for CoQ 10 . Therefore some have suggested that therapeutic targeting will likely be based on achieving specific plasma CoQ 10 levels (e.g., more than 3.5 mg/mL) or tissue saturation.15,26,27 Prescribing a set dosage, even a milligram per kilogram body weight dosage, at this time is a best guess scenario without confirmation by monitoring CoQ 10 blood levels, given the differences noted in absorp- tion rates among the different forms as well as the interindividual variability. Numerous studies have now been conducted claiming enhanced absorption of one form or another.7 However, there are shortcomings in most of these studies, and some of the studies appear to have been set up to show an advantage for commercial reasons. For example, ubi- quinol is being promoted as the best absorbed form of CoQ 10 , yet the published studies were set up in a curious fashion. In the one study examining ubiquinol absorption, the administration of the ubiquinol was always with a total of CoQ 10 capsules that included the emulsifica- tion agents diglycerol monooleate, canola oil, soy lecithin, and beeswax, and although the study used a placebo, it did not compare ubiquinol with ubiquinone.23 It is possible that ubiquinone might have fared just as well if emulsified as well as the ubiquinol in this study. Absorption studies showed that when CoQ 10 was given with food, it was absorbed twice as fast and at least twofold greater than on an empty stomach.28 It is believed that food-induced secretion of bile acids is responsible for the improved absorption. What is known based on current absorption studies is that even- tually a steady state is produced (usually after 3–4 weeks of constant dosing), and the absorption of CoQ 10 may be limited in some individ- uals. Dosages that exceed an individual’s absorptive capacity for CoQ 10 may have minimal effect on efficacy and unnecessarily increase the cost of treatment. When single dosages of CoQ 10 begin to exceed 300 mg, the percentage of CoQ 10 absorbed declines. Plasma CoQ 10 levels at a dosage of 900 mg/day (as ubiquinone in an oil suspension in a soft gel capsule) are not significantly greater than a 600 mg/day dosage. Divided dosages (e.g., two or three times a day) result in higher plasma levels compared with single dosages, especially at higher dosage levels. Despite the challenges, based on existing data from published stud- ies, an attempt can be made to calculate the approximate plasma lev- els of CoQ 10 for different commercial forms at 100 and 300 mg doses for at least 30 days with several caveats. First, these are estimates only, based on a typical 75 kg body weight. Keep in mind that absorption of CoQ 10 in any form is likely enhanced considerably if taken with a large meal that includes some fat. Lastly, considerable pharmacokinetic studies in humans have indicated significant interindividual variabil- ity in CoQ 10 absorption, underscoring the need for monitoring CoQ 10 plasma levels during clinical studies and perhaps clinical use of CoQ 10 as well (Table 68.1).

## 529CHAPTER 68 Coenzyme Q

10 The optimal dose of CoQ 10 for many clinical indications is not known, and plasma or target tissue levels of CoQ 10 are likely the pri- mary determinant of efficacy, rather than the dose.26,29 Current opin- ion based on the scientific literature is that an acceptable therapeutic plasma target level of CoQ 10 should be at least 2.5 mg/mL,30 but levels higher than 3.5 mcg/mL may be necessary for optimum improvement in neurodegenerative diseases and myocardial function.15,26,29 The usual starting dosage for CoQ 10 is generally 100 to 200 mg/day. Where possible, the dosage of CoQ 10 should be adjusted according to the response of the patient and, preferably, by monitoring plasma CoQ 10 levels for 3 to 4 weeks of constant dosing, when steady-state plasma concentrations occur. Less is known about the ability of CoQ 10 and the dose required to reach the central nervous system. Again, divided dos- ages result in higher plasma levels compared with single dosages (e.g., taking 100 mg twice a day produces higher plasma levels compared with taking 200 mg once a day).31


Given the central role of CoQ 10 in mitochondrial function and cellular antioxidant protection, its clinical applications are extensive. There are so many conditions where CoQ 10 may offer benefit that there is no question that it should be considered a conditionally essential nutrient. The specific uses of CoQ 10 are described in the following: • General antioxidant • Cardiovascular disease • Cardiomyopathy • Congestive heart failure • Protection during cardiac surgery • Hypertension • Cancer • Diabetes mellitus • Male infertility • Parkinson’s disease • Friedreich’s ataxia • Muscular dystrophy • Immune function • Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) • Toxicant exposure • Topical antiaging effects

## General Antioxidant

Numerous studies have shown CoQ 10 can reduce oxidative damage, DNA strand damage, LDL oxidation, and formation of lipid perox- ides, thereby supporting its use as a general antioxidant.5,32 In particu- lar, CoQ 10 is often used to counteract the reduced synthesis of CoQ 10 associated with aging. After the age of 35 to 40 years, humans slowly begin to lose their ability to synthesize CoQ 10 .33 It has been proposed that the increase in age-associated diseases is due in part to decreased protection afforded by CoQ 10 as both an antioxidant and a facilitator of energy production at a cellular level. Indeed, CoQ 10 has been shown to activate the expression of the sirtuin and Pgc-1 α genes, proposed as regulators of age and age-associated diseases, and linked to lower oxi- dative stress and upregulated glutathione production as well as mito- chondrial biogenesis.34 Previous studies identified oxidative stress as a promoting factor for dry mouth (xerostomia) and the development of Sjögren’s syndrome, a condition associated with significant dry mouth. Basically, oxidative damage leads to the inability of salivary cells to produce enough ATP to secrete sufficient amounts of water. CoQ 10 exerts antioxidant effects, but its main action in relieving dry mouth may be by increasing energy (ATP) production, allowing the saliva-producing cells enough energy to secrete more saliva into the mouth. In one double-blind study, patients, including 31 with dry mouth, were given either ubiquinol or ubiquinone orally at a dosage of 100 mg/day, or a placebo for month.35 Salivary secretion and salivary CoQ 10 content were analyzed before and after treatment. Among the dry mouth patients treated with ubiquinone, salivary secretion increased significantly from 0.7 g/2 min before treatment to 1.2 g/2 min after 1 month of treatment. Among the patients treated with ubiquinol, salivary secretion also increased significantly from 0.8 g/2 min before treatment to 1.4 g/2 min after treatment. In normal subjects without dry mouth, salivary secretion increased with ubiquinone (from 4.9–5.7 g/2 min) at a statistically significant level, but did not differ significantly after treatment with ubiquinol (from 3.5–3.8 g/2 min). Either form of CoQ 10 exhibited a marked increase in salivary CoQ 10 concentration (ubiquinol more than ubiquionine in dry mouth, ubiquinone more than ubiquinol in normal subjects), suggesting that the observed increase in salivary secretion was attributable to the effect on salivary levels of CoQ 10 .

## Cardiovascular Disease—General Considerations

Enhancing myocardial function is an important, although frequently overlooked, component of the overall prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. CoQ 10 plays a key role in energy production and is therefore essential for all energy-dependent processes, includ- ing heart muscle contraction. CoQ 10 deficiency has been documented in patients with various types of cardiovascular disease. Whether a decline in CoQ 10 levels is a cause or a consequence of heart disease is unclear. Cardiac cells are highly metabolically active, and thus have higher mitochondrial coenzyme requirements to maintain ATP pro- duction. In addition to its role in cellular energetics, exogenously administered CoQ 10 acts as an antioxidant to inhibit LDL oxidation,36 decreases proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necro- sis factor- α , and attenuates markers of oxidative and nitrative stress in a dose-dependent manner.5 CoQ 10 deficiency is common in patients with various types of cardiovascular disease.5,37 Approximately 75% of patients who had cardiac surgery were shown to be deficient in myocardial CoQ 10 . Concentrations of CoQ 10 declined progressively in both blood and myocardial tissue with increasing severity of heart disease.38 Myocardial deficiencies of CoQ 10 were also found in the majority of patients with aortic stenosis or insufficiency, mitral stenosis or insufficiency, dia- betic cardiomyopathy, tetralogy of Fallot, atrial septal defects, and ventricular septal defects.39 Deficiencies have now been documented in congestive heart failure, angina, coronary artery disease, cardiomy- opathy, and hypertension.40

## Cardiomyopathy

Cardiomyopathy can take several forms, but all are manifested by weakening of the heart muscle associated with inadequate heart pump- ing or other functional problems. The well-established role of CoQ 10 as a facilitator of mitochondrial energy production lends strong rationale for a role of CoQ 10 supplementation in all forms of cardiomyopathy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 38 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomy- opathy. After 6 months of supplementation, there was a statistically significant (P = 0.011) improvement in diastolic function, leading the authors to conclude that “administration of coenzyme Q 10 is use- ful in ameliorating cardiac failure in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.”41 In one study, 126 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy received 100 mg/day of CoQ 10 for up to 66 months. After 6 months of treat- ment, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 41% to 59% (P <0.001) and remained stable thereafter with

continued treatment. After 2 years, 84% of the patients were still alive, and at 5.5 years, 52% were alive.42 These survival rates were consider- ably better than the published survival statistics of patients given con- ventional therapy (i.e., 2-year survival rate of 50% for symptomatic cardiomyopathy, and 1-year survival rate of 50% for decompensated cardiomyopathy). In another study, 88 patients with cardiomyopathy received mg/day of CoQ 10 for 1 to 24 months. Significant improvements in at least two of three cardiac parameters (LVEF, cardiac output, and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class) were seen in 75% to 85% of the patients. Approximately 80% of the patients improved to a lower (i.e., more favorable) NYHA functional class.30 In a double-blind, crossover trial, 19 patients with cardiomyopa- thy received 100 mg/day of CoQ 10 or a placebo, each for 12 weeks. Compared with placebo, CoQ 10 treatment significantly increased car- diac stroke volume and LVEF. Eighteen patients reported improvement in activity while taking CoQ 10 .43 In 2014 the results of the Q-SYMBIO trial (Symptoms, Biomarker status [BNP], and Long-term Outcome) were published, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter trial of CoQ 10 as an adjunctive treatment of chronic heart failure. With more than 400 participants enrolled, a 50% reduction in risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event within years was found for those taking 100 mg CoQ 10 three times per day versus placebo. Additionally, significant reductions in both cardiovas- cular mortality (9% vs. 16%) and all-cause mortality (10% vs. 18%) were seen with CoQ 10 supplementation versus placebo, as were reduc- tions in hospital stay and a significant improvement of NYHA class. Subgroup analysis found that those with dilated cardiomyopathy may have even greater benefits; when taking CoQ 10 the hazard ratio for a major cardiovascular event for those without cardiomyopathy was 0.60 compared with placebo, but for those with dilated cardiomyopathy it was 0.28. Furthermore, the benefit attributed to CoQ 10 was in addition to that associated with concurrent medications, including beta-block- ers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers.44

## Congestive Heart Failure

The potential of CoQ 10 as a treatment for congestive heart failure (CHF) was suggested as early as 1967 by Japanese researchers.45 In 1976 these same investigators administered 30 mg/day of CoQ 10 to patients with CHF. All the patients improved, and 9 (53%) became asymptomatic after 4 weeks of treatment.46 Numerous studies since have demonstrated that CoQ 10 supplementation resulted in an improvement of stroke volume, LVEF, cardiac output, cardiac index, and end-diastolic volume index.5,47,48 In the largest multicenter trial completed to date, 2664 patients in NYHA classes II and III CHF received 50 to 150 mg/day of CoQ 10 (78% of patients received 100 mg/day of CoQ 10 ). After 3 months of supple- mentation, the results showed a low incidence of side effects, and the following proportion of patients had improvements in clinical signs and symptoms49: • Cyanosis, 71.8% • Edema, 78.6% • Pulmonary rales, 77.8% • Enlargement of the liver area, 49.3% • Jugular reflux, 71.81% • Dyspnea, 54.7% • Palpitations, 75.4% • Sweating, 79.8% • Subjective arrhythmia, 63.4% • Insomnia, 60.8% • Vertigo, 73.1% • Nocturia, 53.6% The results of these uncontrolled studies were confirmed in several double-blind trials. Some 641 patients with CHF (NYHA classes III or IV) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or CoQ 10 (2 mg/kg per day) for 1 year while continuing conventional therapy. The num- ber of patients requiring hospitalization during the study for worsen- ing heart failure was 38% less in the CoQ 10 group than in the placebo group (P <0.001), and episodes of pulmonary edema were reduced by about 60% in the CoQ 10 group compared with the placebo group (P <0.001).50 These positive results with CoQ 10 , however, have not been seen in all studies. In one double-blind study, 55 patients with CHF in NYHA classes III and IV, with ejection fractions less than 40%, and peak oxygen consumption less than 50% during standard therapy, were randomly assigned to receive CoQ 10 (200 mg) or placebo. Analysis indicated that there were no changes in ejection fraction, peak oxygen consumption, and exercise duration in either group. Possible expla- nations for failure to achieve a therapeutic benefit in this study (and others) may be the result of CoQ 10 not being strong enough to produce significant effects in more severe stages of CHF or the fact that blood levels of CoQ 10 did not reach sufficient levels. Although the mean serum concentration of CoQ 10 increased from 0.95 to 2.2 mcg/mL, in 19 of 22 patients on CoQ 10 , blood levels were below the suggested threshold of 2.5 mcg/mL.51 A more recent study administered CoQ 10 100 mg three times a day for 4 weeks to 21 patients with CHF in a double-blind, placebo-con- trolled, crossover design. CoQ 10 administration resulted in a threefold increase in plasma CoQ 10 levels, improved left ventricular contractil- ity, and subsequently enhanced functional capacity, without any side effects.52 The Q-SYMBIO trial, mentioned previously, was designed to address whether CoQ 10 supplementation extends survival in patients with CHF.53 As discussed previously, significant reductions in both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were found, in addition to the benefit associated with conventional treatments. The Q-SYMBIO trial and other clinical trials were incorporated into a meta-analysis pub- lished in 2017. This analysis of 14 RCTs and more than 2000 patients found that the use of CoQ 10 reduced mortality by 31% compared with placebo among those with heart failure (Fig. 68.3). Additionally, exer- cise capacity was increased with CoQ 10 use, though no differences in the endpoints of left heart ejection fraction or NYHA classification were observed.54 An important consideration in patients with CHF in NYHA class IV is that they often fail to achieve adequate plasma CoQ 10 levels (>2.5 mcg/mL) on supplemental ubiquinone at dosages up to 900 mg/day. In one study, 7 patients with subtherapeutic plasma CoQ 10 levels (mean level, 1.6 mcg/mL, on an average dose of 450 mg of ubiquinone a day [150–600 mg/day]) were changed to an average of 580 mg/day of ubiquinol (450–900 mg/day) with follow-up plasma CoQ 10 levels, clin- ical status, and ejection fraction measurements by echocardiography.55 Mean plasma CoQ 10 levels increased from 1.6 to 6.5 mcg/mL. Mean ejection fraction improved from 22% (10%–35%) to 39% (10%–60%) and NYHA class improved from a mean of class IV to a mean of class II (classes I to III). In this study, ubiquinol dramatically improved absorption in patients with severe heart failure, and the improvement in plasma CoQ 10 levels was correlated with both clinical improvement and improvement in measurement of left ventricular function.

10 to induce oxidative stress. A prospective study of 30 individuals who underwent CPB randomized these patients to oral CoQ 10 (150–180 mg/ day) or placebo for 7 to 10 days preoperatively. The group that received CoQ 10 had significantly fewer reperfusion arrythmias; lower require- ments for inotropic agents, mediastinal drainage, and blood products; and shorter hospital stays compared with the control group.56 Postoperative low cardiac output is a major cause of early death after cardiac surgery. Fifty patients who underwent cardiac surgery for acquired valvular lesions were randomly assigned to receive 30 to 60 mg/day of CoQ 10 for 6 days before surgery or to a control group that did not receive CoQ 10 . Postoperatively, a state of severe low car- diac output developed in 48% of the patients in the control group, compared with only 12% of those in the CoQ 10 group. These results suggested that preoperative administration of CoQ 10 increased the tol- erance of the heart to ischemia during aortic cross-clamping.57 A meta-analysis of eight clinical trials evaluating CoQ 10 supple- mentation for patients undergoing cardiac surgery was published in 2015. CoQ 10 supplementation was associated with a 53% reduced need for inotropic drugs (used to treat low cardiac output). Furthermore, supplementation was associated with a 95% reduction in the risk of developing a ventricular arrhythmia. No change in the cardiac index, length of hospital stay, or risk for atrial fibrillation was observed. Again, dosing may play an important role; in this meta-analysis, doses ranged from 30 mg to 600 mg per day, and in some cases CoQ 10 was not given within 12 hours of surgery, whereas in others it was given orally for days or weeks before and after surgery, and via intravenous drip during surgery.58

## Hypertension

The majority of studies exploring CoQ 10 in the treatment of high blood pressure have been uncontrolled, or have used CoQ 10 in combination with conventional antihypertensive medical treatments, making these studies difficult to interpret. In one study, 109 patients with essential hypertension received CoQ 10 (average dose, 225 mg/day) in addition to their usual antihypertensive regimen. The dosage of CoQ 10 was adjusted according to clinical response and blood CoQ 10 levels (the aim was to attain blood levels >2 mg/mL). The need for antihyper- tensive medication declined gradually, and after a mean treatment period of 4.4 months, about half of the patients were able to discon- tinue between one and three drugs.59 A review of studies on CoQ 10 in the treatment of hypertension (12 clinical trials, 362 patients) con- cluded that in hypertensive patients, CoQ 10 has the potential to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, without significant side effects. Among all included studies, decreases in systolic blood pressure ranged from 11 to 17 mm Hg and in diastolic blood pressure from 8 to mm Hg.60 In three of the 12 studies, CoQ 10 was given in addition to existing antihypertensive medication, and in one of these, more than 50% of the patients were able to cease taking at least one antihyper- tensive medication during the trial. Large prospective and unbiased trials are needed, as concluded by a 2016 Cochrane review that found only two randomized trials sufficiently unbiased to be included in a meta-analysis and did not find a blood pressure–lowering effect of CoQ 10 .61 In a subsequent 2018 meta-analysis reviewing the effect of CoQ 10 on blood pressure among participants with a metabolic disease (including diabetes, dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.), supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduc- tion in systolic blood pressure (standardized mean difference of −0.30; 95% CI −0.52, −0.08), on par with the effect of most antihypertensive medications.62,63 The mechanism for the antihypertensive action of CoQ 10 is thought to be due to its counteracting vasoconstriction, resulting from either an impaired ability of the endothelium to induce nitric oxide–mediated relaxation of underlying smooth muscle, or via preservation of nitric oxide itself.60


Because of its role in enhancing immune function, CoQ 10 has been considered as a possible anticancer agent. In one study, 32 women with breast cancer, who were classified as “high risk” because of tumor spread to the axillary lymph nodes, received 90 mg/day of CoQ 10 , along with vitamins C and E, β -carotene, and essential fatty acids. In six of these women, the tumor became smaller. During the 18-month treatment period, none of the patients died (the expected number of deaths was four), and none showed signs of further distant metastases. Six patients had an apparent partial remission. In addition, patients receiving CoQ 10 required fewer painkillers.64 In follow-up, a pilot study using this nutrient cocktail evaluated the survival of 40 patients with end-stage cancer over 9 years. Median survival of individuals receiving the CoQ 10 -containing nutrient cocktail was 40% longer than median predicted survival using the calculated Kaplan-Meier curve.65 Anthracyclines are a class of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy for a wide range of tumors. The clinical value of these agents is limited by their cardiotoxicity, which is believed to be due to irreversible damage to heart cell mitochondria. These agents cause severe oxidative stress in cardiac inner mitochondrial membranes, resulting in damage to mito- chondrial DNA and subsequent myocyte death.66 Research from the 1980s showed that cancer patients receiving doxorubicin (Adriamycin), a commonly used anthracycline, had lower myocardial levels of CoQ 10 than did controls, and that the mag- nitude of CoQ 10 depletion was directly related to the severity of cardiac 0.01101 Favours [Placebo]Favours [Coenzyme Q10] 0.1100

impairment.67 To determine the effect of CoQ 10 supplementation on doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, seven patients receiving doxorubicin were also given 100 mg/day of CoQ 10 , beginning 3 to 5 days before doxo- rubicin was started. Another seven patients (control group) received doxorubicin without CoQ 10 . Cardiac function deteriorated signifi- cantly in the control group, whereas patients given CoQ 10 had little or no cardiotoxicity, although the cumulative dose of doxorubicin in the CoQ 10 group was 50% greater than that in the control group.68 These preliminary data, coupled with strong scientific rationale, suggest that CoQ 10 supplementation should be considered for the prevention and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

## Physical Performance

Because CoQ 10 is involved in energy production and its concentration in muscle is correlated with performance, it is possible that supplemen- tation may enhance aerobic capacity, muscle performance, and recov- ery.69–71 In one study, six healthy sedentary men (mean age, 21.5 years) performed a bicycle ergometer test before and after taking CoQ 10 (60 mg/day) for 4 to 8 weeks.72 CoQ 10 treatment improved certain perfor- mance parameters, including work capacity at submaximal heart rate, maximal workload, maximal oxygen consumption, and oxygen trans- port. These improvements ranged from 3% to 12% and were evident after about 4 weeks of supplementation. In a double-blind study in sedentary men, 100 mg/day of CoQ 10 showed performance-enhancing effects during repeated bouts of supramaximal exercises.73 Although these studies suggest that administration of CoQ 10 improves physical performance in sedentary individuals, other pub- lications are conflicting. Larger studies are needed to confirm the performance-enhancing capacity of CoQ 10 , and clarify any distinction between sedentary and athletic populations.74 In a recent study that enrolled 21 male athletes, participants were given either placebo or mg CoQ 10 per day, for 30 days, before a single bout of intense exercise. Supplementation prevented the typical depletion of plasma CoQ 10 lev- els, and reduced the cellular level of reactive oxygen species, though it did not alter any indexes of either physical performance or muscle damage.75

## Diabetes Mellitus

Low tissue levels of CoQ 10 have been consistently reported in diabetic patients, as well as a increased ratio of ubiquinone to ubiquinol.76 There are several mechanisms by which CoQ 10 may be of therapeutic value in diabetes.77,78 Improved blood pressure and long-term glyce- mic control have been reported with CoQ 10 supplementation (100 mg twice daily).79 Enhancement of endothelial function may offer some protection against arteriopathies.80 A study of 80 dyslipidemic type diabetics found that CoQ 10 (200 mg/day) in combination with fenofi- brate (200 mg/day) significantly improved endothelial and nonendo- thelial forearm vasodilatory function.81 This effect was not found with either therapy alone or in a placebo group. An accumulating body of research demonstrates a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. The mitochondrial enhancement offered by supple- mental CoQ 10 appears to offer some therapeutic value against a defect in cellular energy production.82,83 In 2018 a systematic review and meta-analysis of CoQ 10 use in dia- betes was published, incorporating 13 randomized and controlled trials and 765 participants. CoQ 10 was associated with a significant reduction in both hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels (Fig. 68.4) but not with fasting insulin levels. It also was linked to a significant increase in HDL cholesterol and a reduction in triglyceride levels.84 Twenty-seven patients with ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and no evidence of organic heart disease received placebo for 3 to weeks, followed by 60 mg/day of CoQ 10 for 4 to 5 weeks. The reduction in VPBs was significantly greater after CoQ 10 than after placebo. The beneficial effect of CoQ 10 was seen primarily in diabetics, in whom the mean reduction in VPB frequency was 85.7%. A significant reduction in VPBs also occurred in 1 (11%) of 9 otherwise healthy patients and in 4 (36%) of 11 patients with hypertension.85

## 533CHAPTER 68 Coenzyme Q

10 Research suggested that sperm cells with low motility and abnor- mal morphology have low levels of CoQ 10 .87 Sperm cells with low CoQ 10 concentrations might be less capable of quenching free radi- cals, and might also be compromised in their ability to produce ATP in these highly metabolically active cells. Some authors suggested using the reduced-to-oxidized CoQ 10 ratio as a diagnostic test for astheno- zoospermia.88 In a 6-month, uncontrolled open trial, in which infertile men were supplemented orally with CoQ 10 , sperm cells demonstrated a significant increase in motility, and both seminal plasma and sperm cell quantity of CoQ 10 increased.89 This was supported by other studies on both sperm motility and fertilization rates.90,91 In 2013 a meta-anal- ysis of 3 studies was published, which found that CoQ 10 supplemen- tation among men with infertility did not improve pregnancy rates (there were no data regarding live births), but it did improve both sperm motility and concentration.92

## Parkinson’s Disease

Excessive free radical production is largely responsible for dopaminer- gic cell death seen in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Both as a cause and an effect of excessive oxidative stress, there is reduced activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Given that CoQ 10 is essential for the function of complex I and is also a powerful antiox- idant, it holds therapeutic potential in the treatment of PD. Reduced levels of CoQ 10 were demonstrated in the platelets of individuals with PD, and CoQ 10 levels were strongly correlated with activity in com- plexes I and II/III. Clinically, it was demonstrated that oral CoQ 10 increased complex I activity.93 A safety trial of CoQ 10 supplementation in PD showed promising results.29 All of the patients had the three primary features of PD— tremor, stiffness, and slowed movements—and were diagnosed with the disease within 5 years of the time they were enrolled. After initial screening and baseline blood tests, the patients were randomly divided into four groups. Three of the groups received CoQ 10 at three different doses (300, 600, and 1200 mg/day), whereas a fourth group received a matching placebo for 16 months. The group that received the highest dose of CoQ 10 (1200 mg/day) displayed a 44% reduction in PD pro- gression compared with placebo. The groups that received 300 and mg/day developed slightly less disability than the placebo group, but the effects were less than those in the group that received the highest dosage of CoQ 10 . Average plasma levels were approximately 1.8, 2.1, and 4.5 mcg/mL, respectively, for the 300, 600, and 1200 mg dosages. These results indicated that the beneficial effects of CoQ 10 in PD might require adequate plasma levels. It is important to point out in this study that CoQ 10 was administered along with vitamin E at a dosage of 1200 international units (IU) per day. Because high dosages of vitamin E interfere with CoQ 10 absorption,12 it might have prevented higher levels of CoQ 10 from being achieved. The researchers were aware of this issue but chose to include the vitamin E, given its apparent pro- tective role against PD at the time (see Chapter 196 on Parkinson’s Disease for more information). Two recent studies cast doubt on the therapeutic efficacy of CoQ 10 in PD. In a German study, a nanonized ubiquinone form of CoQ 10 at a dosage of 100 mg three times daily or a matching placebo was given to 131 patients with PD for 3 months. Plasma levels of CoQ 10 reached 4.6 mcg/mL in the treatment group, yet no effect on PD symptoms was shown. These results indicated that other factors might be responsible for determining the efficacy of CoQ 10 in PD beyond achieving effective plasma levels. Two recent meta-analyses (published in 2016 and 2017) found that despite ample evidence of safety, there was no indication of a benefit from CoQ 10 supplementation.94,95 On May 27, 2011 the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Strokes (NINDS) stopped a Phase III study of CoQ 10 for treatment of early-stage PD.96 The study enrolled 600 patients with early PD at 67 sites throughout North America. Participants were randomized to receive one of the two dosing levels of active CoQ 10 (1200 or mg/day) or matching placebo. All subjects also received vitamin E at a dosage of 1200 IU/day. Although CoQ 10 was shown to be safe, results of an interim analysis showed that it was futile to complete the study because longer patient follow-up was not likely to demonstrate a sta- tistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo. In 2014 the results of this Phase III trial were finally published, and no benefit was found.97 Recently, a smaller study has suggested that when combined with creatine monohydrate, CoQ 10 may slow the decline of cognitive function in Parkinson’s patients.98 Given the disappointing results from the Parkinson Study Group, it remains to be determined whether there is a role for CoQ 10 in Parkinson’s disease, either in com- bination with other therapies or for a subset of patients.

## Friedreich’s Ataxia

Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurological disease char- acterized by loss of myelin in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that mitochondrial oxidative stress in FRDA may be respon- sible for the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with this disease.99 In a placebo-controlled trial, idebenone (a synthetic CoQ 10 analog) significantly decreased heart hypertrophy (more than 20% decrease) in about 50% of study participants, with no adverse effects.100,101 A second study combined CoQ 10 with vitamin E in an attempt to address two of the key features of FRDA—decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain function and increased oxidative stress. This therapy resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in the amount of energy gen- erated by the diseased heart muscle, which returned to near-normal levels. The improvements in skeletal muscle energy generation paral- leled those of the heart but were less substantial.102 A 2-year intervention study of CoQ 10 with vitamin E in 50 FRDA patients demonstrated that low baseline levels of CoQ 10 were the single best predictor of a positive clinical response.103

## Muscular Dystrophy

The muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a group of hereditary diseases characterized by the progressive loss of muscle cells. In some types of MD, an impairment of mitochondrial function may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Several studies demonstrated a deficiency of CoQ 10 in muscle mitochondria of humans with MD.38 In addition, serum CoQ 10 levels were significantly (P <0.05) inversely correlated with the degree of the genetic defect.104 In addition to enhancing mitochondrial function, 90 days of CoQ 10 supplementation resulted in markedly reduced inflammatory insult in animal models of MD.105 The first double-blind trial of CoQ 10 in the treatment of individu- als with MDs and neurogenic atrophies concluded, “Patients suffering from these muscle dystrophies and the like should be treated with vita- min CoQ 10 indefinitely.”106 The same group conducted two studies on patients between 7 and 69 years of age who had MDs associated with cardiac diseases, including the Duchenne, Becker, and the limb-girdle dystrophies; myotonic dystrophy; Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and the Welander disease. Individuals were treated for 3 months with mg/day CoQ 10 or a matching placebo. In both trials, definite improve- ments in physical performance were recorded in the groups receiving CoQ 10 . Cardiac function was monitored by technicians who were blinded to treatment group. In each case, they correctly identified the treatment group to which the patient had been assigned on the basis of improvement or lack of improvement in cardiac function. In a smaller double-blind study, 100 mg of CoQ 10 was given daily for 3 months to 12 patients with progressive MD. CoQ 10 treatment resulted in significant improvements in cardiac output and stroke volume, as

well as increased physical well-being in 4 of 8 patients.38 Subjective improvements included increased exercise tolerance, reduced leg pain, better control of leg function, and less fatigue. A small pilot trial of CoQ 10 supplementation among participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy receiving corticosteroid treatment also found benefit, with an 8.5% improvement in muscle strength among the CoQ 10 group.107

## Immune Function

A number of studies demonstrated immunomodulatory effects of CoQ 10 or its analogs.108–110 In a study of eight chronically ill patients, administration of 60 mg/day of CoQ 10 was associated with signif- icant increases in serum levels of immunoglobulin-G after 27 to days of treatment.111 In a cytokine analysis of white blood cells from 19 human volunteers, tumor necrosis factor- α levels were significantly decreased and interleukin-2 levels increased when incubated with CoQ 10 in vitro.112

## Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Because oxidative stress is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related diseases, the antioxidant activity of CoQ 10 may be of value for individuals with AIDS.112,113 Early studies suggested blood levels of CoQ 10 were significantly lower in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex than in healthy controls, and that supplementation with CoQ 10 improved ratios of lymphocytes.114 Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy, a mainstay of conventional human immunodeficiency virus manage- ment, has been associated with myopathy resulting from side effects on myocyte mitochondria. There is one report of CoQ 10 alleviating this myopathy, thus permitting continuation of nucleoside reverse tran- scriptase inhibitor therapy.115

## Toxicant Exposure

Many occupational and environmental toxicant exposures affect the mitochondrial respiratory chain.116–120 Damage to the respiratory chain can decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to upregulated apoptosis; CoQ 10 demonstrated the ability to reduce this membrane-po- tential damage.121,122 For example, chlorpyrifos, an organophosphorus pesticide associated with oxidative mitochondrial damage, may have some of its toxicity mitigated by CoQ 10 .123 It also appears that CoQ 10 deficiency is associated with impaired detoxification via the sulfide oxi- dation pathway, as CoQ 10 plays the role of an electron acceptor for the enzyme sulfide–quinone reductase (SQR).124 This pathway is important for the detoxification of sulfide, which is endogenously produced via cysteine catabolism (Fig. 68.5). This pathway appears to be impaired among individuals with the nephrotic syndrome, for whom CoQ 10 may be particularly important.125 Although current diagnosis and treatment of environmentally related illnesses remain controversial, cytoprotec- tion with CoQ 10 may be an effective therapeutic method to reduce mito- chondrial damage due to exposure to toxicants, both acute and chronic, and should be a focus of further research.126

## Topical Antiaging Effects

In recent years, makers of several over-the-counter skin creams have begun advertising the addition of CoQ 10 as an ingredient capable of curb- ing the aging process. In a clinical trial, topical CoQ 10 was able to protect against ultraviolet A–mediated oxidative stress, suppress the expression of collagenase, and cause a reduction in wrinkle depth.33 Both ubiquinol and ubiquinone have been shown to increase in deeper epithelial layers (after topical application), and increase the skin’s antioxidant capacity.127

## Side Effects and Safety

CoQ 10 appears to be safe and well tolerated in dosages up to 1200 mg/ day in adults and up to 10 mg/kg body weight/day in children. Because safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established, CoQ 10 should not be used during these times unless the potential clinical ben- efit outweighs the risks. CoQ 10 is contraindicated in cases of known hypersensitivity. In a series of 5143 patients treated with 30 mg/day of CoQ 10 , the following incidence of side effects was reported57: • Epigastric discomfort, 0.39% • Loss of appetite, 0.23% • Nausea, 0.16% • Diarrhea, 0.12%


Cholesterol-lowering statin drugs such as lovastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, which is required for biosynthesis of both cholesterol and CoQ 10 . Thus administration of these drugs might compromise CoQ 10 status by decreasing its synthesis, and statin-associated myopathy has been hypothesized to be related to a depletion of CoQ 10 . Although some trials demonstrated that statin therapy did reduce serum or mus- cle levels of CoQ 10 ,128,129 whether or not this CoQ 10 depletion caused the myopathy remains controversial.130 Given that statins are typically prescribed to lower cholesterol, with the intention being the preven- tion and treatment of cardiovascular disease, the concomitant use of CoQ 10 seems well justified. The question of whether or not CoQ 10 therapy among statin users has additional benefit, however, may finally be answered after the results of two recent meta-analyses. In 2018 a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of statin therapy found that statins were associated with decreased CoQ 10 levels, regardless of the length of ther- apy, intensity, or type of statin.131 That this decrease is consequential is well supported by a 2018 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Heart Association; this analysis of 12 randomized trials and 575 participants given CoQ 10 or placebo (in addition to a statin) found that supplementation with CoQ 10 significantly reduced muscle pain, muscle cramp, muscle tiredness, and muscle weakness, despite no reduction in plasma creatine kinase level (Fig. 68.6).132 The β -blockers propranolol and metoprolol were shown to inhibit CoQ 10 -dependent enzymes.133 The antihypertensive effect of these drugs might therefore be compromised in the long run by the develop- ment of CoQ 10 deficiency.

of CoQ 10 reduced the incidence of drug-induced malaise in patients receiving propranolol.134 A number of phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants were also shown to inhibit CoQ 10 -dependent enzymes. It is therefore possible that CoQ 10 deficiency might be a contributing factor to the cardiac side effects that are frequently seen with these drugs. In two clinical studies, supplementation with CoQ 10 improved electrocardiographic changes in patients on psychotropic drugs.135 Several case reports describing potential interactions between CoQ 10 and warfarin have been reported. CoQ 10 is structurally related to menaquinone (vitamin K 2 ) and may have procoagulant effects.136 In each of these patients, the international normalized ratio (INR), which had been stable and therapeutic, fell below the therapeutic range within 2 weeks of beginning CoQ 10 supplementation (as low as 30 mg/ day).137 The INR returned to the therapeutic range after CoQ 10 was discontinued. It is recommended that the INR be monitored closely if these agents are to be used concomitantly. However, in a double-blind trial, administration of 100 mg/day of CoQ 10 for 4 weeks had no effect on the INR in 21 patients on long-term warfarin therapy.138 Thus the sporadic case reports of an interaction between CoQ 10 and warfarin might have been due to random fluctuations in INR values, rather than to CoQ 10 .15 In a subchronic toxicity assessment, the no observed adverse effect level in rats was estimated to be 600 mg/kg per day for males and mg/kg per day for females; in male and female dogs, the no observed adverse effect level was estimated to be more than 600 mg/kg per day.

## 538SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

• Lipolysis Forskolin possesses additional mechanisms of action independent of its ability to directly stimulate adenylate cyclase and cAMP-depen- dent physiological responses.4 Specifically, forskolin was shown to inhibit a number of membrane transport proteins and channel pro- teins through a mechanism that did not involve the production of cAMP. The result was transmembrane signaling that resulted in acti- vation of other cellular enzymes. Research is under way to determine the exact receptors to which forskolin binds. Another action of forskolin is the inhibition of platelet-activat- ing factor (PAF) by interfering with PAF binding to receptor sites.5 PAF plays a central role in many inflammatory and allergic processes, including neutrophil activation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction (e.g., bronchoconstriction), and reduction in coronary blood flow. Treatment of platelets with forskolin before PAF exposure results in a 30% to 40% decrease in PAF binding. This decrease in PAF binding caused by forskolin was concomitant with a decrease in the physiological responses of platelets induced by PAF. However, this forskolin-induced decrease in PAF binding was not a consequence of cAMP formation because the addition of a cAMP antagonist did not inhibit the action of forskolin. In addition, the inactive analog of forskolin, dideoxyforskolin, which does not activate adenyl cyclase, also reduced PAF binding to its receptor. Researchers speculated that the action of forskolin on PAF binding was due to a direct effect of this molecule and its analog on the PAF receptor itself or to components of the postreceptor signaling for PAF.


The therapeutic ramifications of C. forskohlii based on the pharmacol- ogy of forskolin are immense. In many conditions, a decreased intra- cellular cAMP level is thought to be a major factor in the development of the disease process. C. forskohlii appears to be especially well indi- cated for the following: • Atopic dermatitis • Asthma • Psoriasis • Angina • Hypertension • Weight loss • Glaucoma Although C. forskohlii can be used alone, it may prove to be most useful when combined with other botanicals or measures, or both.

## Inflammatory Conditions

Allergic conditions such as asthma and eczema are characterized by a relative decrease in cAMP in both the bronchial smooth muscle and the skin. As a result, mast cells degranulate and smooth muscle cells contract more readily. In addition, these allergic conditions are also characterized by excessive levels of PAF.

<!-- chunk -->

## Asthma and Eczema

Current drug therapy for allergic conditions like asthma and eczema is largely designed to increase cAMP levels by using substances that either bind to receptors to stimulate adenylate cyclase (e.g., corticosteroids) or inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cAMP once it is formed (e.g., methylxanthines). These actions are different than forskolin’s ability to increase the production of cAMP via trans- membrane activation of adenylate cyclase. The cAMP-elevating action of forskolin supports the use of C. forskohlii extracts alone or in com- bination with standard drug therapy in the treatment of virtually all allergic conditions. C. forskohlii extracts may be particularly useful in asthma because increasing intracellular levels of cAMP results in relaxation of bronchial muscles and relief of respiratory symptoms. Forskolin was shown to have remarkable effects in relaxing constricted bron- chial muscles in patients with asthma.6–8 This type of smooth mus- cle is also found in the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, bladder, and arteries. Forskolin was shown to have tremendous antispasmodic action on these various smooth muscles. This antispasmodic action of forskolin supports the folk medicine use of C. forskohlii in the treatment of not only asthma but also intestinal colic, uterine cramps (menstrual cramps), painful urination, angina, and hyper- tension. In addition to forskolin’s ability to relax smooth muscle, its other antiallergic activities, such as inhibiting the release of his- tamine and the synthesis of allergic compounds, are also beneficial in treating asthma.9 One double-blind clinical study sought to compare the antiasth- matic effects of forskolin with the drug fenoterol. Sixteen patients with asthma were studied using three different preparations: • Single inhalation dose of fenoterol (as a dry-powder capsule [0.4 mg]) • Metered doses of fenoterol (0.4 mg) • Forskolin dry-powder capsules (10 mg) All three preparations led to a significant improvement in respira- tory function and bronchodilation. However, although the fenoterol preparations caused tremors and decreased blood potassium levels, no such negative effects were seen with forskolin. In another study, the bronchodilating effect (after 5 minutes) of forskolin was as good as that produced by fenoterol in 12 healthy vol- unteers (nonsmokers), as determined by whole-body plethysmogra- phy.10 Both substances were administered by metered-dose inhalers. At the beginning (after 3 and 5 minutes) of the study, the protective effect of forskolin against inhaled acetylcholine was as good as that produced by fenoterol, whereas later on (after 15 and 30 minutes), fenoterol provided stronger protection. Whether orally administered forskolin in the form of C. forskohlii extract would produce similar bronchodilatory effects is yet to be determined. However, based on the plant’s historical use and addi- tional mechanisms of action, it appears likely.

## Psoriasis

Psoriasis is a common skin disorder that seems to be caused by a rel- ative decrease in cAMP compared with cyclic guanosine monophos- phate (cGMP). The result is a tremendous increase in cell division. Cells divide in psoriasis at a rate 1000 times greater than normal. Preliminary studies indicated that forskolin might be of great benefit in individuals with psoriasis via its ability to reestablish the normal balance between cAMP and cGMP.1 HO OH H HO O O O O

## 539CHAPTER 69 Coleus forskohlii


The most useful clinical applications of C. forskohlii extracts that will emerge in the future will likely be for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and angina. The cardiovascu- lar effects of C. forskohlii and its components have been studied in great detail.1,11,12 Its basic cardiovascular actions involve the lower- ing of blood pressure, along with improving the contractility of the heart. Again, this is related to increasing cAMP levels throughout the cardiovascular system, which results in relaxation of the arteries and increased force of contraction. The net effect is a significant improve- ment of cardiovascular function.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypertension and Cardiac Failure

Several clinical and animal studies supported the use of forskolin in hypertension and cardiac failure.11–15 In one human study involving seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, forskolin was shown to improve left ventricular function primarily via reduction of preload and without raising metabolic costs.13 This study confirmed earlier animal studies showing that forskolin increased the contractile force of heart muscle.12 In another human study, the hemodynamic effects of intravenous (3 mcg/kg per minute) forskolin given to patients with dilated car- diomyopathy were evaluated.14 Although systemic vascular resistance and diastolic pressure decreased, forskolin had no effect on the cardiac index, ejection fraction, or myocardial oxygen consumption at this low dosage. However, when a small dosage of dobutamine was given along with the forskolin, an increase in all four parameters was observed. At a higher dosage (4 mcg/kg per minute), forskolin increased heart function by 19% and produced a 16% rise in heart rate. However, these changes were associated with symptomatic flush syndromes. These results indicated that forskolin might best be used in congestive heart failure in combination with other botanicals, such as Crataegus (see Chapter 71). Forskolin was also shown to be a direct cerebral vasodilator, indi- cating that it might prove to be useful in cerebral vascular insufficiency and poststroke recovery.15 An additional mechanism of action particularly beneficial in a wide range of cardiovascular conditions is inhibition of platelet aggregation. In this area, the evidence indicated that the standardized C. forskohlii extract was superior to pure forskolin.16 In an animal model evaluating in vivo inhibition of platelet aggregation, rats were divided into four groups: group 1 received C. forskohlii extract (480 mg/kg supplying mg/kg of forskolin), group 2 received forskolin (20 mg/kg), group received dipyridamole, and group 4 served as the controls. All treat- ments were given orally once daily. Adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation was measured on odd days 1 through 15. All three treatments produced significant inhibition of platelet aggregation. On day 15, the inhibitions were approximately 42% for group 1, 37% for group 2, and 52% for group 3. Hence, the extract of C. forskohlii pro- duced greater inhibition than the pure forskolin.

## Weight Loss Programs

Forskolin was shown to stimulate lipolysis, as well as inhibit the syn- thesis of fat in adipocytes.17–20 Forskolin was also shown to counteract the age-related decreased response of fat cells to lipolytic hormones like epinephrine.21 In one double-blind clinical investigation, oral ingestion of forskolin (250 mg of 10% forskolin extract twice a day) for a 12-week period was shown to favorably alter body composition while concurrently increasing bone mass and serum free testosterone levels in overweight and obese men.22 However, a similar study in slightly overweight females showed little benefit over a placebo.23 In the most recent double-blind study, there were no significant advantages with a C. forskohlii extract over the placebo in terms of weight loss or waist-to-hip ratio in the 12-week study, but results showed that sup- plementation with the extract in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet significantly improved insulin and insulin resistance and thus may produce greater effects over a longer period of time and be useful in the management of metabolic risk factors. Significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) were observed in both groups after the 12-week intervention.24

## Glaucoma

In clinical studies, forskolin was shown to greatly reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) when it was applied directly to the eyes.24–27 This effect indicated that topical forskolin preparations might be of benefit in the treatment of glaucoma. Unlike current drug therapy, forskolin actu- ally increased intraocular blood flow, had no side effects, and did not induce miosis. Oral administration might prove effective as well. In an open-label pilot study, 16 patients with glaucoma and stable IOP underwent treatment with different topical drugs and were given a supplement containing 15 mg of forskolin along with rutin (200 mg), thiamin (0.7 mg), and riboflavin (0.8 mg) for 40 days, which produced a further decrease in IOP by roughly 20% of the initial value.28

# OTHER CLINICAL APPLICATIONS

C. forskohlii extracts concentrated and standardized for forskolin con- tent may prove to be useful in a number of other clinical applications, including the following: • Hypothyroidism • Malabsorption and digestive disorders • Depression • Prevention of cancer metastases • Immune system enhancement

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypothyroidism

Forskolin was shown to increase thyroid hormone production, as well as to stimulate thyroid hormone release.29

<!-- chunk -->

## Malabsorption and Digestive Disorders

Forskolin stimulated digestive secretions, including the release of hydrochloric acid, pepsin, amylase, and pancreatic enzymes.30,31 Forskolin was shown to promote nutrient absorption in the small intestine.32 C. forskohlii extracts might prove to be quite use- ful in treating dry mouth because forskolin was found to increase salivation.33


Forskolin was shown to exert antidepressant activity in animal studies.34


The ability to increase cAMP is very relevant to cancer. Forskolin has shown a number of antitumor effects, including the induction of mes- enchymal-to-epithelial transition, inhibition of cell growth and migra- tion, and enhancement of sensitivity to conventional antitumor drugs in cancer cells. Forskolin was also shown to be a potent inhibitor of cancer metastasis in mice injected with malignant cells. As little as mcg administered to mice inhibited metastasis by over 70%.35

## Immune System Enhancement

Forskolin exhibited potent immune system enhancement (primar- ily through activation of macrophages and lymphocytes) in several models.36–38

## 540SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


The recommended dosage should be based on the level of forskolin. Because the forskolin content of coleus root is typically only 0.2% to 0.3%, crude coleus products may not be sufficient to produce a phar- macological effect. The safety of the whole root at high dosages is not as well studied. It is best to use standardized extracts that have known forskolin content. Daily dosages: • Forskolin: 5 to 10 mg two to three times a day • Standardized extract (10% forskolin): 250 mg one to two times a day • Dried root: 2 to 5 g two to three times a day


The animal studies on forskolin indicated low toxicity. Inclusion of C. forskohlii extract in the diet at a 1% level is, however, associated with the inducement of fatty liver, presumably due to nonforskolin components stimulating the synthesis and accumulation of tri- glycerides within the liver.39 Although this level of intake is unlikely in humans, it does indicate that screening for liver function is indicated with any long-term use. The pharmacology of forskolin suggests it would be wise to restrict the use of C. forskohlii preparations in patients with low blood pressure and peptic ulcers.


C. forskohlii preparations should be used cautiously in patients on prescription medications, especially antiasthmatics and antihy- pertensives, due to its ability to potentiate these and other drugs’ effects.

## 542SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

double-blind study did not show that either of two doses of a stan- dardized guggul extract (guggulipid, containing 2.5% guggulsterones) lowered LDL cholesterol levels in healthy adults with hyperlipidemia.15 Subjects received either standard-dose guggulipid (1000 mg), high-dose guggulipid (2000 mg), or matching placebo three times daily for 8 weeks. LDL cholesterol levels decreased by 5% in the placebo group. Both stan- dard-dose guggulipid and high-dose guggulipid raised levels of LDL cholesterol by 4%, respectively. There were no significant changes in lev- els of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or VLDL choles- terol in response to treatment with guggulipid in the intention-to-treat analysis. Although guggulipid was generally well tolerated, 6 participants treated with guggulipid developed a hypersensitivity rash compared with none in the placebo group. These results call into question the clinical effectiveness of guggulipid despite plausible mechanisms of action. In vitro studies showed that the primary mechanism of action involves guggulsterones acting as an antagonist ligand for the farne- soid X receptor (FXR) and upregulating the bile salt export pump. As a result, guggulsterones promote the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and increase the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the blood by the liver.14,16–19 Another possible action of guggulsterones in affecting lipid levels is their ability to stimulate thyroid function.20,21 Despite these noted in vitro effects, more research is needed to clar- ify the clinical usefulness of guggul as a lipid-lowering agent. However, guggul may have other benefits against atherosclerosis beyond low- ering lipid levels. Gum guggul and its extracts, including guggulipid, have been shown to prevent the formation of atherosclerosis and aid in the regression of preexisting atherosclerotic plaques in animals. This implies that they may have similar effects in humans. Gum guggul and guggulipid were also shown to prevent heart dam- age by free radicals and to improve heart metabolism.9,14 Gum guggul and its extracts have a mild effect in inhibiting platelet aggregation and promoting fibrinolysis, implying that it may also prevent the develop- ment of a stroke or embolism.2,14 Stock photo

## Anti-Inflammatory Effects

The guggulsterone fraction of gum guggul was shown to exhibit sig- nificant anti-inflammatory action in experimental models of inflam- mation (e.g., raw paw edema and adjuvant arthritis method).22–24 Its activity in models of acute inflammation is comparable to approx- imately one fifth that of hydrocortisone and equal to phenylbuta- zone and ibuprofen.22 In models of chronic inflammation, it was shown to be more effective than hydrocortisone, phenylbutazone, and ibuprofen in reducing the severity of secondary lesions. The anti-inflammatory action is thought to be caused by inhibition of delayed hypersensitivity reactions.23,24 Guggulsterones exert a num- ber of anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of nuclear factor- κβ .25 The clinical application of these effects may include osteoarthri- tis. In an open trial of 30 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, mg of the concentrated extract three times daily produced significant improvements on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index Total Score and subscales, visual analog scale, and 6-minute walk test. Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index subscales were used as outcome measures.26

## Anticancer Effects

Guggulsterone was shown to exert a wide range of anticancer effects, including an ability to modulate expression of proteins with antiapop- totic, cell survival, cell, angiogenic, and metastatic activities in tumor cells. As a result, evidence suggested that guggulsterone could suppress tumor initiation, promotion, and metastasis.27 The clinical usefulness of these effects has not yet been determined.


Although the crude oleoresin (gum guggul), alcohol extract, and petroleum ether extract all exert lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory action, they are associated with side effects (e.g., skin rashes, diarrhea) at the doses required to produce a clinical effect. Interestingly, in classic Ayurvedic texts, the purification of crude guggul in Triphala kashaya is recommended to eliminate these side effects.2 Guggulipid, the standardized ethyl acetate extract of the gum gug- gul, demonstrated not only greater clinical efficacy but also much greater patient tolerance than crude or purified gum guggul. The dos- age of guggulipid is based on its guggulsterone content. The typical dosage, 25 mg of guggulsterone three times per day, is an effective treatment for elevated cholesterol levels, elevated triglyceride levels, or both. For a 2.5% guggulsterone content extract, this translates to an effective dose of 1000 mg three times/day. For comparison, the daily dosages of the other forms follow: • Crude gum guggul—10 g • Alcoholic extract—4.5 g • Petroleum ether extract—1.5 g


The side effects of crude gum guggul and alcoholic and petroleum ether extracts were discussed previously. In clinical studies, guggulipid did not display any untoward side effects, nor did it adversely affect liver function, blood sugar control, kidney function, or hematologic parameters.11–13 Safety studies in rats, rabbits, and monkeys demonstrated gug- gulipid to be nontoxic.14 It does not possess any embryotoxic or fetotoxic effects and is therefore considered safe to use in preg- nancy. In mice, the oral and intraperitoneal mean lethal dose values were 1600 mg/kg.1 O O H H H

## 543CHAPTER 70 Commiphora mukul (Mukul Myrrh Tree)


Although there are no reported guggulipid–drug interactions, one in vitro study with hepatocytes showed that guggulipid could induce the expression of CYP3A enzyme activity, suggesting that guggulipid therapy should be used cautiously in patients taking prescription med- ications that are metabolized by CYP3A family members, including such drugs as statins, ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), fexofenadine (Allegra), triazolam (Halcion), and many others.28 In addition, guggulsterones demonstrated agonist activity against the estrogen receptor α isoform and the progesterone receptor; therefore it should be used with caution with estrogen and/or progesterone preparations.

## Synergism with Vitamin C

As stated earlier, crataegus is particularly rich in anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins. These flavonoids have strong “vitamin P” activity. Included in their effects are the abilities to increase intracellular vita- min C levels, stabilize vitamin C (by protecting it from oxidation), and decrease capillary permeability and fragility.8,9

<!-- chunk -->

## Collagen-Stabilizing Action

Similar to other proanthocyanidin-rich extracts, crataegus possesses significant collagen-stabilizing action, including the following: • Reinforcement of the natural cross-linking of collagen that forms the collagen matrix of connective tissue (e.g., ground substance, cartilage, tendon) • Prevention of free radical damage because of potent antioxidant and free radical–scavenging action • Inhibition of enzymatic cleavage by enzymes secreted by white blood cells during inflammation • Prevention of the release and synthesis of compounds that promote inflammation, such as histamine, serine proteases, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes


The beneficial effects of crataegus in the treatment of cardiovascu- lar conditions appear to be a result of the following pharmacological actions: • Improvement of the blood supply to the heart by dilating the coro- nary vessels2,3,10–15 • Improvement of the metabolic processes in the heart, which results in an increase in the force of contraction of the heart muscle and elimination of some types of rhythm distur- bances2,3,11,16–18 • Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)19 • Decreased expression of microRNA-155, resulting in an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and improved endothelial function.42 • Donation of electrons producing antioxidative free radical–scav- enging effects • Inhibition of human neutrophil elastase • Increases intracellular calcium concentrations, protecting endothe- lial permeability dysfunction The ability of crataegus to dilate coronary blood vessels has been repeatedly demonstrated in experimental studies. This effect appears to be a result of relaxation of vascular smooth muscle by a combination of direct effects on both the vascular endothelium and smooth mus- cle. In addition, various flavonoid components in crataegus have been shown to inhibit vasoconstriction by various substances, including hypophysin, histamine, and acetylcholine. In addition, procyanidins have been shown to inhibit ACE.2,3,20 Improvement in cardiac metabolism has been demonstrated in humans and animals that have received crataegus extracts.2,3 The improvement is not only a result of increased blood and oxygen sup- ply to the myocardium but also a result of flavonoid–enzyme interac- tions. Crataegus extracts and various flavonoid components have been shown to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE).21 This results in increased levels of cAMP within the myocardium, leading to a positive inotropic effect (i.e., an increase in the force of contraction). This is particularly beneficial in cases of con- gestive heart failure (CHF; discussed in the section “Congestive Heart Failure”). The procyanidins of crataegus demonstrated a specific inhibition of ACE similar to the synthetic ACE inhibitors widely used in the treat- ment of hypertension.20 The proanthocyanidins that appear to have the highest activity are proanthocyanidins B-5 3,3 ′ -di-O-gallate and C-1 3,3 ′ ,3 ″ -tri-O-gallate. It is not surprising that these proanthocyan- idins are found in relatively high concentrations in hawthorn berries, flowers, and their extracts.5,6

disturbances of the mitochondria. Because mitochondria produce 95% of the energy necessary for heart function, therapeutic agents that could influence mitochondrial dysfunction are of special importance. Considering the cardioprotective and cardiotonic effects of hawthorn, studies have been done to investigate the effect of crataegus fruit extracts (CE) on mitochondrial function. One animal study performed an oxygraphic investigation of the effect of CE (in concentration range from 70 ng/mL to 13.9 μ g/mL of cra- taegus phenolic compounds [PC]) on isolated rat heart mitochon- dria.22 At concentrations from 278 ng/mL to 13.9 μ g/mL of PC, CE stimulated stage 2 respiration by 11% to 34% and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential by 1.2 to 4.4 mV, as well as H 2 O 2 production. The highest CE concentration also slightly reduced the maximal adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated and uncoupled respiration, which may be because of inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain between flavoprotein and cytochrome c. An additional animal study investigated the effect of CE on mitochondrial function during experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats.23 For 30 days, CE was administered orally at a dosage of 0.5 mL/100 g body weight. At the end of the days, the animals were administered isoproterenol for 2 days at an interval of 24 hours. Pretreatment with CE maintained mitochon- drial antioxidant status and prevented mitochondrial lipid peroxi- dative damage and a decrease in Krebs’s cycle enzymes induced by isoproterenol. Although further studies are necessary, the promo- tion of mitochondrial function may be a significant mechanism of efficacy.


The clinical use of crataegus revolves around its cardiovascular effects. Its use in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and CHF is discussed in the following subsections.

## Atherosclerosis

Crataegus preparations, although in a supplement form, should be thought of as a necessary food in the prevention and treatment of ath- erosclerosis. Increasing the intake of flavonoid compounds by taking crataegus extracts has numerous health-promoting effects, including reducing cholesterol levels and decreasing the size of existing atheroscle- rotic plaques.24 This effect is probably a result of collagen stabilization. A decrease in the integrity of the collagen matrix of the artery results in cholesterol deposition. Many researchers believe that if the collagen matrix of the artery remains strong, atherosclerotic plaque will never develop. Crataegus flavonoids, by increasing the integrity of collagen structures, may offer significant protection against atherosclerosis. In addition, feeding proanthocyanidin extracts to animals resulted in the reversal of atherosclerotic lesions and decreased serum cholesterol levels. Flavonoids contained in hawthorn extracts appear to offer signif- icant prevention, and potential reversing effects, in the treatment of atherosclerotic processes, which are still the major causes of death in the United States.

## Hypertension

Crataegus exerts a mild antihypertensive effect, which has been demonstrated in both experimental and clinical studies.2 Its action in lowering blood pressure is unique in that it produces a number of diverse pharmacological effects. Specifically, it dilates the coronary vessels, inhibits ACE, acts as an inotropic agent, and possesses mild diuretic activity. Its clinical effects in lowering blood pressure, how- ever, are generally mild.19 In one double-blind study evaluating crataegus hypotensive effects, 79 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to either crataegus extract (1200 mg/day) or placebo for 16 weeks. Hypotensive drugs were used by 71% of the study population, with a mean intake of 4.4 hypoglycemic and/or hypotensive drugs. Although there was no effect on systolic blood pressure, the diastolic blood pressure in the crataegus group dropped from a baseline of 85.6 to 83.0 mm Hg compared with the placebo group (baseline: 84.5 mm Hg; outcome: 85.0 mm Hg). No herb–drug interaction was found.25 The effects of crataegus generally require prolonged administra- tion, and in many instances, it may take up to 2 weeks before ade- quate tissue concentrations are achieved. It should be kept in mind that because beta blockers lower blood pressure by reducing cardiac output, crataegus administration to patients on these drugs may pro- duce a mild hypertensive response.

## Congestive Heart Failure

Crataegus has a long history of use in the treatment of CHF, particu- larly in combination with digitalis or other herbs containing cardiac glycosides such as Cereus grandiflorus, also known as Cactus grandiflo- rus, and Convallaria majalis. It potentiates the action of the cardiac gly- cosides, presumably via its ability to inhibit cAMP-PDE and to interact with calcium channels. Because of this enhancing effect, lower doses of cardiac glyco- sides can be used. In addition, magnesium has also been shown to augment digitalis action. For mild to moderate cases of CHF, crataegus extract used alone may be sufficient, but for moderate to severe CHF, it should be used in combination with other cardiac glycosides. The effectiveness of crataegus in early or mild stages of CHF was repeatedly demonstrated in double-blind studies.2,3,26–33 In a meta-analysis of 10 trials including 855 patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes I to III), it was concluded that hawthorn extract provided significant benefit in symptom control and physiological outcomes as an adjunctive treat- ment for chronic heart failure. Exercise tolerance, the pressure–heart rate product, and symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath and fatigue) all improved significantly with hawthorn treatment compared with placebo.34 In one double-blind study, 30 patients with CHF (NYHA stage II) were assessed in a randomized, double-blind study.29 Treatment con- sisted of a crataegus extract standardized to contain 15 mg procyanidin oligomers per 80-mg capsule. Treatment duration was 8 weeks, and the substance was administered at a dose of one capsule taken twice a day. The group receiving the crataegus extract showed a statistically sig- nificant advantage over placebo in terms of changes in heart function as determined by standard testing procedures. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also mildly reduced. Like all other studies with crataegus extracts, no adverse reactions occurred. In another study, 78 patients with CHF (NYHA stage II) were given either 600 mg of extract standardized to contain 18.8% procyanidolic oligomers or placebo daily.30 The parameter used to measure effective- ness was the patient’s working capacity (W) on a bicycle ergometer. After 56 days of treatment, the crataegus group had a mean increase of 25 W compared with the placebo group’s increase of only 5 W. In addition, the crataegus group also experienced a mild, but significant, reduction in systolic blood pressure (from 171–164 mm Hg) and heart rate (from 115–110 beats/min). There was no change in blood pressure or heart rate in the placebo group. Crataegus provides a definite dose response. Individuals with more severe CHF require higher dosages to experience the most ben- efit. This comment is based on an important finding in a double-blind

study of 209 patients with NYHA class III CHF. Although those receiv- ing 900 mg of a crataegus extract standardized to contain 18.8% pro- cyanidolic oligomers demonstrated improvement in all parameters tested, those receiving 1800 mg showed even better results.32 The fail- ure of some studies to demonstrate a therapeutic benefit with cratae- gus extracts may reflect inadequate dosages being administered.35–37


Clearly, the dosage depends on the type of preparation and source material. The amount of crataegus extract used in various clinical studies on CHF was equivalent to 30 to 169 mg of epicatechin or 3.5 to 19.8 mg of flavonoids, usually administered in two or three doses. Standardized extracts are preferred because the flavonoid content in crude preparations can vary tremendously. The dosages listed for the various crataegus formulas are for use three times a day: • Berries or flowers (dried): 3 to 5 g or as infusion • Tincture (1:5): 4 to 5 mL (alcohol may elicit pressor response in some individuals) • Fluid extract (1:1): 1 to 2 mL • Freeze-dried berries: 1 to 1.5 g • Flower extract (standardized to contain 1.8% vitexin-4 ′ -rhamno- side or 18% procyanidolic oligomers): 200 to 600 mg


Crataegus was shown to have low toxicity, with a mean lethal dose of 25 mg/kg.38 In a human study in patients with CHF, dosages at levels 100 times the typical dosage did not produce any evidence of toxic- ity. Although some studies showed that proanthocyanidins might be carcinogenic, more careful evaluation indicated that the carcinogenic- ity was probably a result of nitrosamines found in the extracts used.39 Purified proanthocyanidins were found to be nonmutagenic, accord- ing to the Salmonella mutagenicity assay system. In total, 166 adverse events were reported in a review of 24 clin- ical studies and data from 5577 patients who received the daily dose (range, 160–1800 mg) and had 3 to 24 weeks of treatment with haw- thorn monopreparations. Most of these adverse events were, in gen- eral, mild to moderate, with the most frequent adverse events being dizziness/vertigo, gastrointestinal complaints, headache, and heart palpitation.40 Postmarketing surveillance studies reported only mild and infrequent side effects with crataegus extract. In a study of patients, 14 adverse events (1.4%) occurred after the administration of 900 mg of hawthorn extract for 24 weeks. In two patients, a causal relation with crataegus was suspected, but it was regarded by the treat- ing doctors as unlikely. In another postmarketing surveillance study of 3664 patients who were treated with 900 mg of crataegus extract for 8 weeks, 48 patients (1.3%) reported adverse events, including hot flushes, stomach complaints, palpitations, dizziness, dyspnea, head- ache, and epistaxis. In 19 patients, this resulted in discontinuation of the treatment.26


Hawthorn may potentiate or inhibit the actions of anticoagulants, anti- hypertensives, and cardiac glycosides. This concern is based primarily on theoretical grounds rather than clinical reports. Importantly, in a randomized crossover trial with eight healthy volunteers, hawthorn did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters for digoxin. This suggests that the combination of hawthorn and digoxin may be administered safely.41

suggesting a unique prejunctional and postjunctional effect on sensory afferent nerves. These pharmacological results tend to confirm the tra- ditional uses of dragon’s blood to relieve itching, pain, edema, redness, and discomfort.

## Antidiarrheal Effect

Crofelemer is an extract of the proanthocyanidins and tannins from dragon’s blood latex approved as a drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 (tradename Mytesi previously Fulyzac, originally studied as an investigational drug Provir or Virend or SP-303 hereinafter referred to as crofelemer). It is a first-in-class agent useful for different types of noninfectious secretory diarrhea as it prevents chloride and fluid secretion into the bowel by directly inhibiting two distinct chloride channels. Crofelemer restored intestinal fluid accumulation to near-normal levels in mice administered cholera toxin.10

## Antimicrobial Effect

Several phenolic compounds and diterpenes isolated from drag- on’s blood demonstrated potent activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli in vitro.11 Dragon’s blood latex significantly inhibited growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms in vitro, includ- ing Proteus vulgaris, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.12

## Antiproliferative or Cytotoxic Effect, or Both

Dragon’s blood latex and taspine were as effective as paclitaxel and vinblastine on human melanoma cells in vitro.13 Taspine was cyto- toxic against cervical cancer and hamster lung cells in vitro.14 Dragon’s blood induced apoptosis in human gastrointestinal cells in a dose-de- pendent manner, and cell proliferation decreased in all cells exposed to dragon’s blood for 48 hours.15 Overall, the effects were deemed similar to those observed with paclitaxel. Dragon’s blood significantly reduced cancer cell adhesion, with more than 85% of cells remaining in suspension. Taspine is also a topoisomerase inhibitor, but unlike other inhib- itors such as doxorubicin and etoposide, taspine was cytotoxic to cells overexpressing drug efflux transporters and induced widespread apoptosis in spheroids in vitro and, to some extent, in vivo.16 However, Dragon’s blood showed no cytotoxicity and actually increased survival in 89% of acute leukemia cells.17

## Ulcer Healing Effect

Dragon’s blood administered at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:10,000 in drinking water assisted the healing of ulcers in rats with acetic acid– induced gastric ulcers.7 These doses were equivalent to doses used in traditional medicine for the treatment of gastric disorders. It healed ulcers comparably to a combination of penicillin and streptomycin and resulted in ulcers that were smaller, less inflamed, and with lower bacterial content. Whole dragon’s blood latex was effective at lower doses than was crofelemer. The latex contains trace amounts of com- pounds that are 30 times more potent than penicillin.

## Antiviral Effect

Various compounds in dragon’s blood showed antiviral activity against influenza, parainfluenza, herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types I and II, and hepatitis A and B in vitro.18 Crofelemer showed antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and inhibited viral penetra- tion of the host cell.19 Crofelemer also showed antiviral activity against two strains of HSV type 1, as well as a strain of HSV type 2 at a dose comparable to that of acyclovir.20 The compound significantly reduced HSV lesion formation in the mouse vaginal model (applied topically in a 5%–10% preparation). At aerosol doses of 0.5 to 9.4 mg/kg per day, crofelemer increased the survival of mice lethally infected with RSV.21 At aerosol doses of 1.3 to 9.8 mg/kg, it reduced lung titers of RSV in infected rats. Crofelemer administered intraperitoneally also significantly reduced pulmonary RSV titers in infected rats with a minimum efficacious dose of 3 mg/kg.22 Crofelemer administered once daily for 8 days beginning before or after influenza A infection in mice reduced lung consolidation, but was lethally toxic at the dose of 30 mg/kg per day. The drug administered as an aerosol (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL) for 1 hour twice daily also reduced lung consolidation in animals. However, when administered before virus exposure, crofelemer treatment lengthened mean day to death, but did not inhibit lung virus titer.23

## Wound-Healing Effect

In rats, crude dragon’s blood rapidly stimulated wound contraction, formation of both a crust and new collagen along with quick and com- plete regeneration of the epithelial layer. The isolated polyphenol frac- tion stimulated contraction of the wound and formation of the crust but delayed wound repair and had no influence on the growth of new blood vessels.24 Dragon’s blood precipitates proteins and other matrix elements, fostering accelerated wound healing with reduced pain, inflammation, and scarring.3 Taspine showed a dose-related cicatrizant effect when administered in vivo to mice.25

## Analgesic

Ten pest control workers exposed to frequent insect bites applied either dragon’s blood balm or placebo balm to bites and recorded the results over a 3-month period.3 When workers had multiple simul- taneous bites, they used both balms on different bites and compared the results. Dragon’s blood latex offered rapid symptomatic relief in all cases and all applications. It was deemed far more effective than placebo by participants.

## Diarrhea

Crofelemer is approved by the FDA for symptomatic relief of noninfec- tious diarrhea in adult patients with HIV/AIDS or antiretroviral ther- apy (ART). Approval was based on a multicenter trial that randomized 376 patients with HIV/AIDS on ART to take either oral crofelemer mg twice daily or placebo.26 Crofelemer significantly reduced secretory diarrhea compared with placebo. No significant benefit in stool consistency was seen in a double- blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; n = 242). The lack of benefit seen may possibly be a result of the diarrhea in IBS not being caused by a derangement of chloride secretion.27 O ON O O O O

## 550SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Crofelemer 125 and 250 mg doses four times a day was effective in improving symptoms of acute-onset traveler’s diarrhea in a mul- ticenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of adults. However, a 500-mg dose was no more effective than placebo, suggesting additional studies are needed.28 Clinical research on the benefit of crofelemer specifically in infec- tious diarrhea are largely lacking. A review of crofelemer in secretory diarrhea noted two foreign studies currently only available in abstract form. In one, a single 125-mg dose of crofelemer administered after rehydration and oral azithromycin significantly reduced watery stool output in the first 24 hours in patients with cholera compared with placebo in a preliminary trial of 100 adults.29 In a second, 98 patients with acute diarrhea caused by various pathogens were treated with cro- felemer (250 mg four times daily) or placebo for 2 days. Those taking crofelemer had better overall clinical success resolving watery stools in 48 hours but statistical details were lacking. (FN: Ibid.) Further clinical studies on the benefit of crofelemer in infectious diarrhea are definitely needed.

## Herpes Simplex Viral Lesions

Virend (a topical formulation of crofelemer) showed a trend toward decreased lesion pain in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 45 HIV-positive patients with active-phase, culture-positive genital or perineal HSV lesions, or both. Virend was more active in patients with smaller lesion areas. Two patients experienced pain and burning after applying Virend, and one withdrew from the study for this reason. In another open-label study, 9 AIDS patients with HSV unresponsive to acyclovir were treated with crofelemer.30 The drug showed a transient positive effect but failed to completely heal or stop virus shedding. Several patients complained that crofelemer caused pain or burning on application.

## Stretch Marks

In an open trial of 10 women with stretch marks at hip level and without, a cream combining Punica granatum (pomegranate) seed oil and dragon’s blood latex extract was applied twice daily for weeks.31 The cream improved skin thickness, hydration, and elastic- ity, suggesting it might be helpful in preventing or improving stretch marks.


Dragon’s blood powder in a cream base applied twice daily signifi- cantly improved wound healing duration from the third day in a dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 60 patients undergoing skin tag repair (a total of 100 wounds).32 The polyphenolic compounds create a protective layer on the wound surface, preventing microbial contamination and appear to shorten the inflammation pro- cess in wound healing.


In traditional medicine, the internal dose is 3 to 20 drops mixed in a beverage, one to three times daily for up to 3 weeks.2,7 The pure latex is applied topically as needed. Although the usual study dose of crofelemer for diarrhea is to 250 mg four times daily, the manufacturer Napa Pharmaceuticals recommends a 125-mg delayed release tablet twice daily (https:// www.mytesi.com). Doses of 125 and 250 mg of crofelemer, administered every 6 hours, were more effective at reducing the duration of traveler’s diarrhea than the 500 mg dose.33


Dragon’s blood, used topically or at low internal doses, is consid- ered nontoxic.34 Neither dragon’s blood nor taspine showed carcino- genic or tumor-promoting effects in a 17-month long mouse study.35 Taspine (<150 ng) was nontoxic to human foreskin fibroblasts.21 It had no cell proliferative, carcinogenic, or tumor-promoting effects. 3 ′ ,4-0-Dimethycedrusin, isolated from dragon’s blood, was nonpro- liferative and instead inhibited thymidine incorporation while pro- tecting cells against degradation in a starvation medium.15 In vitro, dragon’s blood had a negligible effect on proliferation of endothelial cells and was not cytotoxic.36 Crofelemer at doses of 16 to 18.7 mg/ kg per day caused weight loss and decreased survival time in mice and rats.21 Crofelemer injected intraperitoneally caused significant weight loss and death in rats at doses of 30 mg/kg per day. However, no tox- icity was observed after oral administration of up to 270 mg/day of crofelemer.22


Very little information is available about drug interactions with dragon’s blood, but none has been reported in the existing clinical studies. However, crofelemer significantly worsened dacomitinib- induced diarrhea without altering blood levels of dacomitinib in rats.37 Whether this would be a problem in humans should be inves- tigated in a clinical trial.

## 552SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


Turmeric is the major ingredient of curry powder and is also used in prepared mustard. It is extensively used in foods for both its color and flavor. In addition, turmeric is used in both the Chinese and Indian (Ayurvedic) systems of medicine as an anti-inflammatory agent and for the treatment of numerous conditions, including flatulence, jaun- dice, menstrual difficulties, bloody urine, hemorrhage, toothache, bruises, chest pain, and colic. Turmeric poultices are often applied locally to relieve inflammation and pain.


Turmeric and its derivatives have undergone a great deal of pharma- cological investigation.1,2 Although a number of components demon- strate activity, curcumin and the volatile oil components are believed to be the most active components. Since 1990, more than 9000 sci- entific investigations on turmeric and curcumin have been published. Turmeric and curcumin-rich extracts have been shown to possess the following effects and many more: • Antioxidant • Anticarcinogenic • Anti-inflammatory • Antimicrobial • Cardiovascular protective • Hepatoprotective • Gastrointestinal carminative and protectant • Neuroprotective These beneficial effects and actions, however, are largely based on in vitro or experimental models. There are significant pharmacoki- netic issues with curcumin because it is poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body. Pharmacokinetic studies in animals showed that 40% to 85% of an oral dose of curcumin passes through the gastrointestinal tract unchanged.3,4 Several studies have looked at relatively high dosages of curcumin powder in humans. In one study, 24 healthy volunteers were administered escalating doses from 500 to 12,000 mg.5 No curcumin was detected in the serum of participants administered 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, or 8000 mg. Table 73.1 shows the concentrations of curcumin in two subjects (one taking 10,000 mg and one taking 12,000 mg). No plasma concen- trations of curcumin were detected in the remaining subjects at the 10,000- or 12,000-mg dose levels. Similar results were seen in other studies looking at dosages ranging from 3.6 to 12 g. Another challenge with curcumin and other polyphenols is that they circulate bound to glucuronic acid. The theory is that when cells or mitochondria experience cellular stress or damage, they release glu- curonidase. This enzyme subsequently liberates the curcumin, flavo- noid, or other polyphenol to exert its effect locally or on a cellular basis.

## Antioxidant Effects

Turmeric and curcumin exert significant antioxidant activity. Because of its bright yellow color and antioxidant properties, turmeric is often used to protect against lipid peroxidation in butter, margarine, cheese, and other food products. Although turmeric powder as well as both water- and fat-soluble extracts have been shown to be effective anti- oxidants in various in vitro and in vivo models, curcumin is the most potent component.2 For active oxygen species, curcumin is slightly weaker than vitamin C but stronger than vitamin E and superoxide dismutase. Against hydroxyl radicals, curcumin offers greater effec- tiveness than these vitamins.6 Not all of the antioxidant properties of turmeric are due to curcumin alone, because the aqueous extract of turmeric is more effective against superoxide than curcumin and is much stronger in inhibiting oxidative damage to DNA.7,8 The antioxi- dant activities of curcumin may in part explain the anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and cardioprotective capacity of this spice. In vitro and in vivo studies have also shown this antioxidant action to be neu- roprotective as well.9

## Anticarcinogenic Effects

The antineoplastic effects of turmeric and curcumin have been demonstrated at all steps of carcinogenesis: initiation, promotion, and progression. In addition to inhibiting the development of can- cer, several studies suggest that curcumin can also promote cancer regression. The protective effects of turmeric and its derivatives are only partially explained by its direct antioxidant and free radical– scavenging effects. It also inhibits nitrosamine formation, enhances the body’s natural antioxidant system, increases the levels of glutathione and other nonprotein sulfhydryls, and acts directly on several enzymes and gene loci. Curcumin’s ability to protect against damage to DNA was demon- strated in a study in a community with a high content of groundwater arsenic.10 Arsenic is extremely carcinogenic because it causes severe oxidative damage to DNA. Blood samples before curcumin supple- mentation showed severe DNA damage, with increased levels of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. Three months of curcumin interven- tion reduced the DNA damage, retarded free-radical formation and lipid peroxidation, and raised the level of antioxidant activity. In another study, cigarette smokers receiving turmeric demonstrated a significant reduction in the level of urinary-excreted mutagens—an indication of the ability of the body to rid itself of cancer-causing com- pounds via detoxification mechanisms (Fig. 73.3). For many reasons, curcumin is emerging as a very important agent in the battle against cancer.11 Data also suggest that curcumin causes cancer to regress. Some of curcumin’s benefits come from its antioxidant activity, but it also: • Inhibits the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines • Enhances the body’s production of cancer-fighting compounds, such as glutathione • Promotes the liver’s proper detoxification of cancer-causing com- pounds • Prevents overproduction of cyclooxygenase-2, an enzyme that may contribute to the development of tumors In addition to these preventative actions, curcumin has also been shown to inhibit tumor growth in several ways: • Inhibiting epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor sites: EGF stim- ulates cells to proliferate by connecting to a receptor on the cell sur- face. About two thirds of all cancers produce an abundance of these receptors, which makes them highly sensitive to EGF. By reducing the number of EGF receptors, curcumin decreases the cell’s ten- dency to proliferate. • Inhibiting angiogenesis: Fibroblast growth factor is a protein that promotes the formation of new blood vessels to feed the growing tumor.

## Anti-inflammatory Effects

The volatile-oil fraction of C. longa has been demonstrated to pos- sess anti-inflammatory activity in various experimental mod- els (e.g., Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritis, formaldehyde- and carrageenan-induced paw edema, and cotton pellet and granuloma pouch tests).12,13 Its effects in these studies were comparable to cor- tisone and phenylbutazone. Even more potent in acute inflammation is curcumin. In animal models of acute inflammation, curcumin is as effective as cortisone or phenylbutazone, but it is only half as effective in chronic models.14,15 However, although phenylbutazone and corti- sone are associated with significant toxicity, curcumin displays virtu- ally no toxicity (see later discussion under “Toxicology”).

## 554SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

The rank in order of potency of curcumin analogs, cortisone, and phenylbutazone in carrageenan-induced paw edema is as follows: sodium curcuminate > tetrahydrocurcumin > curcumin > cortisone > phenylbutazone > triethylcurcumin.15,16 Based on in vitro studies, curcumin exhibits many direct anti-inflammatory effects, including the following17: • Inhibition of leukotriene formation • Inhibition of platelet aggregation • Promotion of fibrinolysis • Inhibition of neutrophil response to various stimuli involved in the inflammatory process • Stabilization of lysosomal membranes • Inhibition of NF- κ B • Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor The blocking the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-en- hancer of activated B cells (NF- κ B) by curcumin is especially import- ant.18 Curcumin also inhibits tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α ), a major mediator of inflammation in most diseases, and this effect is regulated by the activation of a transcription factor, NF- κβ .19 Curcumin’s counterirritant effect may also be a major factor in its topical anti-inflammatory action. Sodium curcuminate can be pro- duced by mixing turmeric with slaked lime. This mixture, applied as a poultice, is an ancient household remedy for sprains, muscular pain, and inflamed joints. Capsaicin, a similar pungent principal from Capsicum frutescens (cayenne pepper), has been shown to be quite effective as a topical pain reliever in cases of postherpetic neuralgia and arthritis. Both capsaicin and curcumin deplete nerve endings of the neurotransmitter of pain, substance P.20 In addition to its direct anti-inflammatory effects, curcumin also appears to exert some indirect effects. In models of chronic inflam- mation, curcumin was much less active in adrenalectomized animals. Possible mechanisms of action include the following: • Stimulating the release of adrenal corticosteroids • “Sensitizing” or priming cortisol receptor sites, thereby potentiat- ing cortisol action • Increasing the half-life of endogenous cortisol through alteration of hepatic degradation


The effects of turmeric and curcumin on the cardiovascular system include the prevention of oxidative damage to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and reducing fibrinogen levels.21–24 These effects are of great significance in preventing athero- sclerosis and its complications. In animal studies, adding as little as 0.1% curcumin to a high-cho- lesterol rat diet decreased cholesterol levels to one half of those found in rats fed cholesterol but no curcumin. Curcumin’s cholesterol-low- ering actions include interfering with intestinal cholesterol uptake; increasing the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids by increasing the activity of hepatic cholesterol-7- α -hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis; and increasing the excretion of bile acids via its choleretic effects.24 Effects on blood lipids from human studies are equivocal. In one small study, 10 healthy volunteers received 500 mg/day of curcumin for 7 days.21 A significant decrease in the level of serum lipid peroxides of 33%, an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 29%, and a decrease in total serum cholesterol of 11.63% were observed. However, two other studies failed to show any effect on blood lip- ids. One study used escalating doses (15, 30, and 60 mg three times daily),25 and another used dosages of up to 4 g/day for 6 months, but these studies only raised the plasma curcumin concentration to nmol/L.26 Curcumin’s effect on fibrinogen and platelet aggregation, which are known predictors of future coronary heart disease, may be more signif- icant than its effects on cholesterol. In a preliminary study of 30 appar- ently healthy volunteers, baseline levels of fibrinogen were recorded, and 8 subjects were found to have high plasma fibrinogen (above ng/mL).27 These subjects were given a hydroalcoholic extract of C. longa containing 20 mg of curcumin for 15 days. Impressively, cur- cumin administration decreased the fibrinogen levels to the range of 240 to 290 mg/dL (Table 73.2). Turmeric’s and curcumin’s action on inhibiting platelet aggrega- tion appears to be mediated by inhibiting the formation of throm- boxanes (a promoter of aggregation) while simultaneously increasing prostacyclin (an inhibitor of aggregation).

## Hepatic Effects

Curcumin exhibits hepatoprotection similar to that of glycyrrhizin and silymarin (see Chapters 96 and 123, respectively, for further discussion) against carbon tetrachloride and galactosamine-induced liver injury.28 This protection is largely a result of its potent anti- oxidant activity. Similar results were seen with Javanese turmeric (Curcuma xanthorrhiza). Mice given intraperitoneal injections of the hepatoxic drugs carbon tetrachloride (32 mg/kg) and acet- aminophen (600 mg/kg) experienced significantly decreased liver damage, as measured by serum glutamate oxaloacetate and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, when treated with 100 mg/kg of turmeric.29 The antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects alone support turmer- ic’s historical use in liver disorders; however, turmeric and curcumin also exert anti-inflammatory and choleretic effects. The increases of serum glutamate oxaloacetate and serum glutamate pyruvate transam- inase commonly seen in experimental models of inflammation were prevented by curcumin. Curcumin is an active choleretic, increasing bile acid output by more than 100%. In addition to increasing bili- ary excretion of bile salts, cholesterol, and bilirubin, curcumin also increases the solubility of bile.28 This suggests a benefit in the preven- tion and treatment of cholelithiasis.

## Gastrointestinal Effects

Turmeric and its components exert a number of beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal system. Turmeric’s long use as a carminative is supported in preclinical studies showing it to inhibit gas formation by Clostridium perfringens and in rats given diets rich in flatulence-pro- ducing foods. In addition, sodium curcuminate was shown to inhibit intestinal spasm, and another compound from turmeric, p-tolymeth- ylcarbinol, was shown to increase the secretion of secretin, gastrin, bicarbonate, and pancreatic enzymes.2 As a component of curries and spicy foods, there is some concern that turmeric may be irritating to the stomach. However, several stud- ies showed turmeric to be beneficial to gastric integrity. Turmeric and curcumin were shown to increase the mucin content of the stomach and exert gastroprotective effects against ulcer formation induced by stress, alcohol, indomethacin, pyloric ligation, and reserpine.30 However, at high doses, curcumin or turmeric may be ulcerogenic (see later discussion on “Toxicology”).

## Antiaging and Neuroprotective Effects

As far as slowing down the aging process, in addition to the effects discussed previously, there is considerable evidence that curcumin protects against age-related brain damage, in particular, Alzheimer dis- ease. Researchers began exploring this effect after noting that elderly (aged 70–79) residents of rural India, who eat large amounts of tur- meric, were shown to have the lowest incidence of Alzheimer disease in the world, 4.4 times lower than that of Americans. In addition, researchers also demonstrated that curcumin was able to prevent the development of amyloid plaque and the neurofibrillary tangles that are the hallmark features of the brain lesions in mice specifically bred to develop the disease.31,32

## Antimicrobial Effects

Alcohol extracts and the essential oil of C. longa were shown in one study to inhibit the growth of most organisms occurring in cholecystitis (i.e., Sarcina, Gaffkya, Corynebacterium, and Clostridium).2 Other micro- organisms that were inhibited include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Entamoeba histolytica, and several pathogenic fungi.33 The con- centrations used in these studies were relatively high: 0.5 to 5 mg/mL of the alcohol extract and essential oil and 5 to 100 mg/mL of curcumin.


Turmeric and curcumin preparation have extensive potential clinical applications. The most popular uses of curcumin are for three primary purposes: (1) as a general antioxidant to prevent heart disease and slow down the aging process; (2) as a chemoprotector against cancer and as a treatment adjunct; and (3) to reduce inflammation, particularly in osteoarthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

## General Antioxidant and Prevention of Atherosclerosis

The benefits of curcumin as a general antioxidant and in the preven- tion of atherosclerosis and slowing down the aging process have been previously discussed. Curcumin’s antioxidant activity may be particu- larly helpful in preventing exercise-induced oxidative damage as well as protecting against low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from becom- ing oxidized and damaging arteries. In addition, curcumin exerts other beneficial effects in preventing atherosclerosis, including possibly low- ering cholesterol levels, preventing plaque formation, inhibiting plate- let aggregation, and reducing fibrinogen levels (see previous discussion “Cardiovascular Effects”).24 In regard to its effects as a general antioxidant, several clinical stud- ies with forms of curcumin with enhanced absorption provide clinical support. For example, in one double-blind study, 40 patients with mild-to-moderate primary knee osteoarthritis were given Curcumin C3 Complex + Bioperine capsules (1500 mg of curcuminoids/day in 3 divided doses) or matched placebo capsules for a period of 6 weeks. Curcumin supplementation resulted in a significant elevation in serum SOD activities (mean change: 2.94 vs. –0.38; p < 0.001) and a signifi- cant reduction in MDA concentrations (mean change: –5.26 vs. –2.49; p = 0.044) in the curcuminoids compared with the placebo group. These changes in the serum activities of SOD and concentrations of GSH and MDA during the course of the trial were significantly cor- related. Short-term supplementation with curcuminoids attenuates systemic oxidative stress in patients with osteoarthritis. These antiox- idant effects may account for the reported therapeutic effects of cur- cuminoids in relieving osteoarthritis symptoms.34 Theracurmin was also shown to reduce oxidative stress in a dou- ble-blind clinical trial. It also increased the antioxidant capacity in response to acute endurance exercise. In the study, 10 male partici- pants, ages 26.8 ± 2.0 years, completed three trials in a random order: (1) placebo (control), (2) single (only before exercise), and (3) dou- ble (before and immediately after exercise) curcumin supplementa- tion trials. Each participant received oral administration of 90 mg of curcumin (from Theracurmin) or the placebo 2 hours before exercise and immediately after exercise. Each participant walked or ran at 65% of VO 2 max on a treadmill for 60 min. Blood samples were collected preexercise, immediately after exercise, and 2 hours after exercise. The concentrations of serum derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites measured immediately after exercise were significantly higher than preexercise values in the placebo trial (308.8), but not in the single (259.9) or double (273.6) curcumin supplementation trials. Serum biological antioxidant potential concentrations measured immedi- ately after exercise were significantly elevated in the single and double curcumin supplementation trials compared with preexercise values (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that curcumin supplementation can reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress by increasing blood antioxi- dant capacity. In another double-blind study, Theracurmin (150 mg curcumin) was shown to dramatically enhance the benefits of exercise on improv- ing the health of the aorta and the entire arterial system. In the study, 45 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to four interven- tions: placebo ingestion (n = 11), curcumin ingestion (n = 11), exer- cise training with placebo ingestion (n = 11), or exercise training with curcumin ingestion (n = 12). Very detailed assessments were used to evaluate cardiovascular function in all subjects. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the regular endurance exercise com- bined with daily curcumin ingestion lowers the age-related increase in left ventricular (LV) afterload to a greater extent than either inter- vention alone in postmenopausal women. LV afterload is the tension against which the heart must contract to eject blood. Arterial stiffness, especially in the aorta, is the major determinant of LV afterload. The stiffer the artery due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the artery), the greater the LV afterload. Not surprisingly, an increase in LV is an inde- pendent risk for heart failure and death due to heart disease mortality. LV afterload tends to increase with advancing age. Regular physical exercise has been found to decrease the LV afterload to an extent, but in this study, the effect of exercise plus Theracurmin (equivalent to capsules per day) reduced LV afterload, but neither therapy on its own was as effective. These results indicate that some of the cardiovascular benefits associated with exercise are greatly enhanced when exercise is combined with Theracurmin, and vice versa.36 In another evaluation in postmenopausal women, the effect of Theracurmin (150 mg curcumin) on vascular endothelial function was determined by using flow-mediated dilation as an indicator. In total,

<!-- chunk -->

## 556SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

32 postmenopausal women were assigned to three groups: control, exercise, and curcumin groups. The curcumin group ingested cur- cumin orally for 8 weeks. The exercise group underwent moderate aer- obic exercise training for 8 weeks. Before and after each intervention, flow-mediated dilation was measured. Results indicated that curcumin ingestion was equal to aerobic exercise training in increasing flow-me- diated dilation in postmenopausal women.37 The effects of curcumin (1.5 g per day) on risk factors for athero- sclerosis were investigated in a 6-month randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial that included subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The primary parameter assessed to measure ath- erosclerotic processes was pulse wave velocity (PWV), a well-accepted surrogate marker used for assessing atherosclerosis status. Results showed that curcumin intervention significantly reduced PWV, increased the level of serum adiponectin, and decreased the level of leptin. These results are associated with reduced levels of homeosta- sis-model-assessed insulin resistance, triglycerides, uric acid, visceral fat, and total body fat. In summary, a 6-month curcumin interven- tion in the type 2 diabetic population lowered the atherogenic risks. In addition, the extract helped improve relevant metabolic profiles in this high-risk population.38

## Cancer Prevention and Treatment Adjunct

The anticancer effects of curcumin have been demonstrated in preclin- ical studies at all steps of cancer formation: initiation, promotion, and progression. Even dietary consumption of turmeric has been shown to exert some protective effects against cancer. In one human study, long-term smokers were given 1.5 g of turmeric daily, whereas a group of 6 nonsmokers served as a control group.39 At the end of the 30-day trial, the smokers receiving the turmeric demonstrated a significant reduction in the level of mutagens excreted in the urine. These results are quite significant because the level of urinary mutagens is thought to correlate with the systemic load of carcinogens and the efficacy of detoxification mechanisms. Due to widespread exposure to smoke, aromatic hydrocarbons, and other environmental carcinogens, the fre- quent use of turmeric as a spice appears warranted. In one study, 62 patients with either ulcerating oral or cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas who failed to respond to the standard treat- ments of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy were given either an ethanol extract of turmeric (for oral cancers) or an ointment containing 0.5% curcumin in Vaseline.40 The ointment or extract was applied top- ically three times daily. At the end of the 18-month study, the treatment was found to be effective in reducing the smell of the lesion (90%), itch- ing and exudate (70%), pain (50%), and the size of the lesion (10%). Although these were not spectacular results, it must be pointed out that this patient population failed to respond to standard medical treatment. Two studies have been conducted in patients with advanced pan- creatic cancer given 8000 mg of regular curcumin daily. These stud- ies showed some positive results.41,42 For example, in one study of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, 8000 mg of curcumin pro- duced clinically relevant biological activity in two patients. The failure to affect more patients in these studies is thought to be the result of poor absorption of curcumin. Formulations with much greater bio- available curcumin may offer better results. For example, in one study, Theracurmin was given to 16 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who were unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy.43 This Phase study sought to determine safety and dosage parameters. The patients produced no significant adverse effects even at relatively high dosage levels for Theracurmin (200 mg/day and 400 mg/day). The results showed that Theracurmin produced significant increases in the blood concentrations of curcumin in a dose-dependent fashion—the higher the dosage, the greater the increase in curcumin in the blood. Median plasma curcumin levels 2 hours after Theracurmin administration (representing peak levels) were as follows: • 324 ng/mL at Level 1 (Theracurmin containing 200 mg of cur- cumin) • 440 ng/mL at Level 2 (Theracurmin containing 400 mg of cur- cumin) These values were significantly higher than the median values (85 ng/ mL) achieved in the authors’ previous study using 8 g of conven- tional curcumin. The big finding from the study was that Theracurmin produced a significant improvement in key quality-of-life (QOL) scores, such as the following: • Fatigue • Functional improvement (emotional, role, cognitive, physical, and social functions) • Diarrhea • Appetite loss In addition, the median survival time (MST) was 132 days, and three patients (21%) survived more than 12 months. As a reminder, these patients were unresponsive to conventional cancer treatment, and with such advanced cancer, they were generally regarded as termi- nal with an average survival time of less than 2 months, so these results are quite promising.

## General Inflammation

C. longa has been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a general anti-inflammatory. This use seems to be substantiated not only by the experimental studies described previously but also by clinical inves- tigations in a variety of inflammatory conditions. In an early study, the postoperative inflammation model for evaluating nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was used, and it showed curcumin to exert comparable anti-inflammatory action to phenylbutazone.44 However, although curcumin has an anti-inflammatory effect simi- lar to phenylbutazone and various NSAIDs, it does not possess direct analgesic action. It is also important to point out that phenylbutazone and NSAIDs are associated with significant adverse effects, whereas curcumin is not. As far as validation of systemic effects, there is a study that involved a rather interesting condition, chronic inflammation of the uvea—the front portion of the eye including the iris.45 The study group consisted of 106 patients divided into three main groups of different uveitis ori- gin: group 1 (autoimmune uveitis), group 2 (uveitis due to herpes), and group 3 (different causes of uveitis). The patients were given mg of Meriva for 1 year. In the previous year, there were a total of relapses. In the 1-year treatment group with Meriva, there were only relapses at the end of the 12-month follow-up, an 88% improvement. This study provides considerable evidence that curcumin can affect inflammation in a chronic inflammatory condition. Again, the theory is that because curcumin circulates bound to glu- curonic acid, when cells or mitochondria experience cellular stress or damage, they release glucuronidase. This enzyme subsequently liber- ates the curcumin to exert its effect locally or on a cellular basis.

## Osteoarthritis

Curcumin exerts a number of mechanisms that address much of the underlying pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). In addition to its antioxidant effects, in vitro studies demonstrated that curcumin exerts a number of beneficial effects through its ability to block the activation of the NF- κ B system, such as suppressing the release of proteoglycans and metal metalloproteases and the expression of cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin E-2, and inflammatory cytokines in chondrocytes.46

<!-- chunk -->

## 557CHAPTER 73 Curcuma longa (Turmeric)

Clinical studies also show some benefits in osteoarthritis. In one double-blind study, 40 patients with mild to moderate primary knee OA were given Curcumin C3 Complex + Bioperine capsules (1500 mg of curcuminoids/day in 3 divided doses) or matched placebo capsules for a period of 6 weeks. Treatment with curcuminoids was associated with significantly greater reductions in WOMAC (p = 0.001), visual analog scale (VAS; p < 0.001), and LPFI (p = 0.013) scores compared with placebo. With respect to WOMAC subscales, there were signifi- cant improvements in the pain and physical function scores but not in the stiffness score.47 In a second analysis of this clinical trial, serum levels of interleukins 4 (IL-4) and 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ), transform- ing growth factor- β (TGF- β ), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined at baseline as well as at the end of the trial. The results did not indicate any significant difference between the study groups, and the authors concluded: “Significant improvement in clinical symptoms of OA in curcuminoid-treated subjects cannot be attributed to the systemic anti-inflammatory effects of these phytochemicals.”48 Effects may be more localized at sites of inflammation, as described previously, although this preparation and more bioavailable forms of curcumin have shown systemic anti-inflammatory effects. In the first double-blind study with curcumin in OA, 50 patients over 40 years old with knee osteoarthritis confirmed by x-ray took either 180 mg/day of curcumin (as Theracurmin) or a placebo daily for 8 weeks. Blood biochemistry analyses were performed before and after 8 weeks of each intervention to evaluate safety. The patients’ knee symptoms were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks by the knee-scoring system of the Japanese Orthopedic Association and also the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure, the knee pain VAS, and the need for NSAIDs. The results showed that knee pain scores were significantly lower in the Theracurmin group than in the placebo group in those patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Theracurmin also lowered the use of celecoxib (Celebrex) much more significantly than placebo. Although 60% of the placebo group still relied on Celebrex for ade- quate pain relief at the 8-week mark, only 32% of the Theracurmin group still needed the NSAID, and there was a definite strong trend for eventual discontinuation. No major side effects were observed in the patients taking Theracurmin. This study is significant because it showed such a significant advantage over a placebo in a short-term study. Generally, in OA, this requires a much larger study group and much longer periods of time. Therefore, for Theracurmin to show such clear benefit in this relatively small, short-term study bodes well for people with OA gaining immediate and noticeable benefits with curcumin.49 Meriva has also been used with success in several studies.50 In the first study, 50 patients were given 1000 mg Meriva (providing 200 mg of curcumin) for 3 months, after which symptom scores decreased by 58%, walking distance on the treadmill test was prolonged from 76 to 332 m, and the level of an inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein) in the blood decreased from 168 to 11.3 mg/L in the subpop- ulation with high C-reactive protein (CRP).51 In another study, patients with osteoarthritis were given the same dosage of Meriva for 8 months. Just as in the previous study, symptom scores, walking dis- tance, and blood measurements of inflammation were all significantly improved.52

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

Curcumin has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with pos- itive outcomes. For example, in one double-blind crossover clinical trial in patients with RA, curcumin (1200 mg/day) was compared with phenylbutazone (300 mg/day) (Fig. 73.4).

duration of morning stiffness, walking time, and joint swelling were comparable in both groups.53 In a more recent study in patients with active RA, 45 patients diagnosed with RA were randomized into three groups, with patients receiving regular, nonenhanced curcumin (500 mg) and diclofenac sodium (50 mg) alone or their combination. The primary end points were a reduction in Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28. The secondary end points included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) crite- ria for reduction in tenderness and swelling of joint scores. Patients in all three treatment groups showed statistically significant changes in their DAS scores. Interestingly, the curcumin group showed the high- est percentage of improvement in overall DAS and ACR scores (ACR 20, 50, and 70), and these scores were significantly better than those of the patients in the diclofenac sodium group.45 Another small clinical trial used a more bioavailable form (Cureit). The 36 patients were divided into three groups, 250 mg curcumin, 500 mg curcumin, or a placebo twice daily. Significant changes in ESR, CPR, and rheumatoid factor (RF) values in patients receiving the study product compared with baseline and placebo. The results indi- cate that this novel curcumin in a turmeric matrix acts as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent for the management of RA at a dose as low as 250 mg twice daily, as evidenced by significant improvement in the ESR, CRP, VAS, RF, DAS, and ACR responses compared with placebo.54

## Gastrointestinal Inflammation

Absorption of curcumin may not be as significant of a factor when dealing with gastrointestinal inflammation. There have been three randomized controlled trials in the treatment of ulcerative colitis that included a total of 142 patients. The use of curcumin along with mesalamine was associated with increased odds of clinical remission. Clinical improvement, endoscopic remission, and improvement rate also trended higher in the curcumin group compared with placebo.55 In one of the double-blind studies with ulcerative colitis, patients received regular curcumin, 1 g after breakfast and 1 g after the evening meal, plus sulfasalazine or mesalamine, and 39 patients received placebo plus sulfasalazine or mesalamine for 6 months. Of the patients who received curcumin, 2 relapsed during 6 months of ther- apy (4.65%), whereas 8 of 39 patients (20.51%) in the placebo group relapsed. Furthermore, curcumin improved both the clinical signs and symptoms with ulcerative colitis via standard activity indexes.56 In another study, 50 people with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis not responsive to mesalamine were given 1.5 g of curcumin twice a day (3 g per day of curcumin) or placebo for 1 month with continued mesalamine treatment. At week 4, 53.8% of those receiving curcumin went into remission, whereas none of the patients who received pla- cebo achieved remission.57 In another study, 1000 mg of curcumin taken twice daily in addition to mesalamine or sulfasalazine for months helped maintain remission from ulcerative colitis compared with standard medications plus placebo.58 But a lower dose (450 mg of curcumin daily) did not improve remission rates or improve mucosal healing compared with placebo in men and women with active ulcer- ative colitis taking mesalamine in another study.59 This difference in response may be related to dosage. In a study using an enhanced form of curcumin similar to Theracurmin, 56 men and women with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis found that 80 mg curcumin taken three times daily (240 mg per day) in addition to mesalamine for 1 month modestly decreased urgency of bowel movements and improved self-reported well-being, but did not decrease blood in the stool or colitis-related skin ulcers, compared with mesalamine alone.60


On the basis of the evidence presented previously, it is clear that tur- meric can be consumed liberally in the diet for its health-promoting effects. When specific medicinal effects are desired, due to the current understanding of curcumin pharmacokinetics, extracts of C. longa or curcumin are more feasible in achieving sufficient absorption. Turmeric extracts, and more specifically curcumin preparations, are now major sellers in North America, with sales well above $300 million in 2018. The total global market for curcumin is growing as well and is expected to reach $1.3 billion by 2025. When natural prod- ucts become commercially popular, it is not uncommon for synthetic versions to be introduced. That appears to have begun in early 2015. Plant-derived products can be distinguished from synthetic products by their content of an exceedingly small but accurately determinable amount of radioactivity. Plants assimilate carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere, which contains a small quantity of radioactive CO 2 . When made synthetically, the material has zero radioactivity. Any adulteration of an herbal extract, even partially, with synthetic equiv- alents can be detected accurately as to the relative ratios of each of the constituents. The commercial landscape with curcumin has focused on improv- ing bioavailability. Historically, turmeric and curcumin have been consumed in a lipid base, such as lecithin, fish oils, or essential fatty acids (with meals) or formulated in conjunction with Piperine or bro- melain (on an empty stomach). A number of new methods now exist to enhance the absorption of curcumin. Table 73.3 provides several formulas reported to have enhanced bioavailability. These prepara- tions deserve special mention because of their clinical investigations, most notably Meriva and Theracurmin. Meriva is produced by com- plexing curcuminoids with phosphatidylcholine to Phytosome.49 Theracurmin is a surface-controlled particle dispersion within gum ghatti as the carrier.61 It has an average particle size of curcumin of 0.19 μ m compared with an average particle size of 22.75 μ m in curcumin powder. This represents a reduction of over 100 times.

## 559CHAPTER 73 Curcuma longa (Turmeric)

Many brands/formulations will offer comparisons to curcumin. However, this practice is irrelevant given the poor oral absorption of curcumin. If the absorption of curcumin nears zero, how is any multi- ple of that number relevant clinically? Based on existing data from clin- ical studies, what is more important than comparing it to curcumin is the ability of a preparation to produce clinical results based on achiev- ing targeted blood values. Here are the recommended targets: • For general anti-inflammatory support, the therapeutic target is to 100 ng/mL • For more severe inflammation and in Alzheimer disease, the thera- peutic target is 150 to 200 ng/mL • For cancer and serious inflammatory conditions, the therapeutic target maybe 300 ng/mL or more When evaluating absorption data from published human trials or the marketing claims from a manufacturer, the question comes down to what dosage of the preparation is required to produce the targeted blood levels listed here.


Toxicity has not been reported at standard dosage levels. The oral mean lethal dose levels for turmeric, its alcohol extracts, and curcumin have not been determined because 2.5 g/kg fed to mice, rats, guinea pigs, and monkeys and 3 g/kg sodium curcuminate fed to rats resulted in neither mortality nor chromosomal aberrations in teratology tests. At high doses, curcumin or turmeric may damage the gastrointestinal system because curcumin, with doses of 100 mg/kg body weight, was ulcerogenic in rats. Some studies found a sensitivity of mice to tur- meric that resulted in hepatotoxicity. Curcumin toxicity has not been found in rats or other mammals, even at very high doses (5%–10% by weight of diet). Human studies suggest that curcumin is nontoxic to humans up to 8000 mg/day when taken by mouth for 3 months. Even the more bioavailable formulations of curcumin have been shown to be safe for humans.62


Curcumin has several possible drug interactions, only a few of which have been confirmed. In one human study, 300 mg of curcumin reduced the absorption of the β -blocker talinolol by roughly 35%.63 In rabbits, pretreatment with curcumin resulted in increased plasma elimination half-life, thereby reducing the dosage of norfloxacin.64 In an experimental model, curcumin was shown to inhibit apopto- sis produced by a number of chemotherapy agents, including campto- thecin, mechlorethamine, and doxorubicin.62 Based upon in vitro studies, curcumin may inhibit the following drug-metabolizing enzymes: CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2A6.65 Curcumin was also shown to downregulate intestinal P-glycoprotein levels, thereby increasing the concentrations of Celiprolol and midaz- olam. This action may have significance for other drugs influenced by intestinal P-glycoprotein downregulation, including colchicine; vari- ous chemotherapy agents, including etoposide, doxorubicin, and vin- blastine; digoxin; and immunosuppressive agents.66 Some theoretic concern has been raised that curcumin might increase the risk of bleeding of anticoagulant drugs due to its ability to decrease platelet aggregation.67

## 561CHAPTER 74 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

androgen, little evidence of direct androgenic activity exists, so any androgenic activity is most likely mediated through its conversion to other more potent androgens. As a person ages and both ovarian and testicular production of hormones declines, this peripheral conversion of DHEA/DHEAS becomes increasingly more important as a source of these androgens.12 In women, about two thirds of circulating tes- tosterone is produced from peripheral conversion of ovarian and/or adrenal precursors. This percentage is higher in women who have had bilateral oophorectomy.16 The biosynthesis of all sex steroids in humans proceeds through DHEA.17 As a steroid precursor, DHEA is converted to both estro- gens and androgens, depending on the requirements of the target tissue. The majority of DHEA conversion to metabolites occurs within peripheral cells via the enzymes aromatase and steroid sulfa- tase (STS), both of which are present in the majority of human cells (Fig. 74.2). The effect of endogenous DHEA in humans varies significantly depending on the individual’s age, gender, menopausal status, and DHEA levels. On a cellular level, both the target tissue and intra- cellular enzyme availability shape the fate of the molecule.18 This process, often referred to as intracrinology, allows for local action of the various hormonal metabolites of DHEA on target tissues such as the brain, bones, breasts, and ovaries without either a specific DHEA receptor or a significant increase in the circulating levels of these metabolites. A specific high-affinity DHEA receptor has not yet been discovered, and there is little evidence that DHEA is able to exert any physiological action without either modulating another receptor type or being converted into an active metabolite or another hormone, with the exception of its recently discovered direct effects on the neu- rotransmitter system.3,19,20 In the brain, for example, endogenous DHEA’s effects appear to be mediated via a combination of sex ste- roids, metabolites such as α -hydroxy-DHEA, γ -aminobutyric acid, N-methyl-d-asparate, or other receptors.12 In vitro studies demon- strated that DHEA has the ability to activate estrogen receptors in the prostate at reasonable physiological concentrations, as well as demonstrating an inhibitory effect of DHEA on androgen receptors at much higher concentrations.19

# DHEA IMMUNOLOGY

Research has shown a significant immune modulation effect, includ- ing both immune stimulation and antiglucocorticoid effects.21 Most of this information must be approached with caution in terms of a clinical perspective, however, due primarily to the fact that a prepon- derance of the data are from either in vitro studies or in vivo murine studies. DHEA appears to have a significant regulatory effect on cytokine production in the form of increasing interleukin-2 (IL-2) secre- tion from TH-1 cells and decreasing production of IL-6 and IL-10 from TH-2 cells.21 It has also been shown to significantly increase serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and natural killer (NK) cell numbers in healthy age-advanced men with low DHEAS lev- els.22 IL-6 stimulates hepatocytes to produce acute-phase reactants and B-lymphocytes to produce immunoglobulin. In rheumatoid arthritis, levels of IL-6 correlated strongly with both erythrocyte sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor titers.23 Both IL-6 and IL-10 were shown to be mediators of inflammatory- and age-re- lated diseases, such as polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthri- tis, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. These same mediators are implicated as possible contributors to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and β -cell malignancies.24 It has been theorized that the increase in IL-6 production during the process of aging might be due in part to diminished DHEA secre- tion.24 This theory is based on research demonstrating that serum DHEA levels correlated negatively with serum IL-6. Exogenously administered DHEA inhibits IL-6 secretion in a U-shaped fashion, with serum concentrations equaling that of healthy controls exerting the greatest effect.24 In one double-blind study, administration of 50 mg/day of DHEA to postmenopausal women produced a twofold increase in NK cell activity and a 6% decrease in the proportion of T-helper cells.25 The significance of these changes is not entirely clear. Although the increase in NK cell activity might be expected to enhance immune sur- veillance against cancer and viral infections, the decline in T-helper cells could have adverse consequences. However, because DHEA is known to mediate T-cell responses,26 the decline in T-helper cells could merely be a reflection of enhanced T-cell function. DHEA was also shown to have a measurable positive effect in terms of mitigating the immune-suppressive effects of both endogenously produced and exogenously administered glucocorticoids.21


Early studies hinted at a wide variety of beneficial effects in condi- tions such as primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, mood and self-esteem, diabetes, obesity, decreased immune function, athero- sclerosis, and many of the disorders typically associated with nor- mal aging.27 Although promising, the clinical utility of many DHEA studies may be limited in that they have been overly reliant on ani- mal models, use inconsistent dosing protocols (in some cases doses unachievable in humans), and do not consider the rapid metabolism of DHEA, test subject comorbidities, or organ-specific differences.28 Rodents have little endogenous DHEA, and their DHEA levels do not decrease with age. DHEA in rodent studies is often administered at supraphysiological doses, which may also make it difficult to deter- mine the clinical relevance of using physiological doses of DHEA in humans. It is the intention of this chapter to base recommendations for the clinical use of DHEA on human studies to the greatest extent possible.

## Adrenal Hypofunction/Addison’s Disease

Despite the well-documented decline in DHEA levels seen in true adrenal hypofunction, adrenal hormone replacement protocols do not routinely recommend the administration of DHEA.29–31 Even in the context of adequate glucocorticoid replacement, individuals with reduced adrenal function commonly report symptoms of depression and dysthymia, as well as a general reduction in overall quality of life. Several studies in patients with adrenal insufficiency demonstrated that DHEA replacement might result in an improvement in mood and fatigue, an increase in sexual satisfaction, and a better overall sense of well-being.32–36 H O O H H H

## Aging

Preliminary data suggest that DHEA might retard the aging process. For example, in a study of 75 healthy subjects, aged 90 to 106 years, men with the highest DHEAS levels had the highest level of function- ing, as assessed by the Katz’s scale of Activities of Daily Living (ADL).37 Several other studies in elderly humans supported an inverse correla- tion between DHEA levels and the degree of dependence in activities of daily living and mobility. In one study, plasma DHEA levels were low in 80% of male nursing home residents who required total care, compared with 40% in other nursing home residents and 6% in inde- pendently living men of comparable age.7,38 In men older than 90 years of age, higher DHEAS levels were asso- ciated with a higher body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, taken as indices of the body’s energy (fat) reserves. In women older than years of age, DHEAS levels were positively correlated with serum-free triiodothyronine and inversely with triglycerides.37 In an attempt to determine whether DHEA supplementation would counteract defects associated with aging, 280 healthy individuals between the ages of 60 and 79 years old were given 50 mg/day of DHEA or placebo for a year. In women older than 70 years of age, there was a reduction in the amount of bone loss and an increase in most libido parameters. Women also showed improvements of skin status, including greater hydration, epidermal thickness, sebum production, and pigmentation.39 Although DHEA levels do not appear to correlate significantly with cognitive function,6,7,40 low serum DHEAS was associated with decreased psychological well-being and symptoms of depression.7


Elevated cortisol levels are well documented in depression, occurring in approximately 50% of cases.41 Hypercortisolemia has also been shown to impair learning and memory in humans, and prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids leads to neuronal atrophy.42,43 Therefore the neurocognitive deficits observed in depressive disorders may be par- tially attributable to glucocorticoid hypersecretion. DHEA possesses significant antiglucocorticoid activity,44 and it may be via this mecha- nism that administration of DHEA reduces neurocognitive deficits in major depression.45,46 An extensive study of depression in adolescents showed approx- imately 30% had abnormally low DHEA levels,47 and mean levels of DHEA in the saliva of depressed adults were lower than those in nor- mal control subjects.41 Improvements in cognition were observed after oral administration of DHEA to middle-aged and elderly depressed patients,48 and the antidepressant actions of DHEA were demonstrated in several randomized controlled trials.49,50–53 The ability of DHEA to affect depressive symptomatology seems to be most substantial where DHEA levels are low or in those with an elevated cortisol-to-DHEA ratio. CSF DHEAS levels are highly correlated with serum levels,7 and DHEA easily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Evidence also sug- gests the brain synthesizes DHEA from cholesterol.54 The ability of DHEA to enhance mood may be related to its role in the cen- tral nervous system as a neurosteroid. DHEA supplementation was shown to increase levels of β -endorphins, bind N-methyl-d- asparate receptors, act as an antagonist of γ -aminobutyric acid receptors, regulate the excitatory neurotransmitter system, and protect against the deleterious effects of glucocorticoids.3,49,50,55 In rats, DHEA was shown to increase hypothalamic serotonin levels.56 These pharmacological properties might help explain the efficacy of DHEA in mood disorders. New research looking at the effects of DHEA on mood disorders, particularly minor and major depression, has revealed a significant improvement of symptoms in just 3 weeks when subjects were supple- menting with 90 mg/day of DHEA. In each study, few adverse events were reported, suggesting this readily available intervention might have clinical utility in some populations.50–52,57

## Alzheimer’s Disease

Unlike peripheral DHEA, which is predominantly converted to estro- gens and testosterone, DHEA metabolism in the central nervous system appears to be somewhat unique.58 A decreased concentra- tion of plasma DHEAS in patients with Alzheimer’s disease has been reported,59–61 and low plasma DHEAS levels appears to be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease.59 However, elevated brain tissue and CSF levels of this steroid also appeared to be a risk factor 17β-HSD-2 17β-HSD-4 3β-HSD-1 3β-HSD-2 Steroid FASteroid Sulfatase Steroid Sulfatase E2 TESTO 5-DIOL DHT

for the development of Alzheimer’s disease.62 Reduced plasma DHEAS levels did not appear to be associated with the degree of cognitive decline or risk of mortality.63 Several small studies using DHEA in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease produced unimpressive results,64–67 and it remains unclear as to whether different study designs might produce positive results. For instance, one proposed mechanism was that DHEA’s antiglucocor- ticoid effects might offset hippocampal damage associated with ele- vated basal cortisol levels, and yet another looked at the inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and NMDA-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in the brain, suggesting an antioxidant effect.64,65 Despite its unlikely role in cognitive improvement, there continues to be a substantial amount of enthusiasm for the potential role of DHEA as a neuroprotective agent.

## Menopause

Practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) often recommend including DHEA as part of a postmenopausal hormone therapy regimen to promote well-being, mental acuity, and enhance sexual function. A closer look at the current medical literature revealed that low sexual function in women was associated with low DHEAS more than any other androgen68 and suggested several possible uses for DHEA in this population. That said, any discussion pertaining to the use of DHEA in meno- pausal patients is likely handicapped by the fact that there is often great disparity between the way CAM practitioners prescribe DHEA and the way it is used in studies. CAM practitioners typically recom- mend smaller daily doses of 5 to 25 mg rather than the 50 mg/day (or more) that is often used in clinical research. Most clinical research also uses DHEA as the sole intervention, something most CAM prac- titioners would be unlikely to do with actual patients, as they would often employ some combination of estrogens, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone, while attempting to help a patient improve their diet, exercise patterns, and other aspects of their lifestyle. One study that attempted to explore the use of DHEA in this type of combined manner demonstrated that oral dosing of DHEA at 10 mg/day for months, either alone or in combination with estradiol and micronized progesterone, produced a significant rise in both androgens and β -en- dorphins, as well as a decrease in cortisol levels. Although intellectually promising and noteworthy, the researchers’ decision to measure only biochemical outcomes instead of the physiological outcomes that are useful in clinical practice leaves much still to be determined.11 Topical application of 1% DHEA for 4 months resulted in an improvement in several parameters of skin health compared with topi- cal application of the same formulation without the DHEA.69 Although evidence regarding the oral administration of DHEA does not tend to demonstrate consistent efficacy in terms of improv- ing libido in postmenopausal women,70,71 there is promising evidence regarding the use of vaginal DHEA for this purpose. Clinical trial data on DHEA vaginal suppositories demonstrated significant positive effects on libido, arousal, pleasure, and orgasm, as well as improve- ment in measures of vaginal atrophy, parabasal and superficial cells, pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia), and a lowering of vaginal pH. Also of potential clinical significance is the fact that 3 months of intra- vaginal DHEA administration did not affect endometrial histology and did not increase serum levels of estradiol, testosterone, or DHEA over those found in normal postmenopausal women.72–76

## Osteoporosis

A possible relationship between DHEA deficiency and osteoporosis was suggested by a study of women with Addison’s disease in whom the onset of menopause was followed by an unusually rapid rate of bone loss. This accelerated bone loss was associated with marked reductions in plasma concentrations of both DHEA and testoster- one.77 A study examining women aged 45 to 69 years determined that 55 of 105 women had low bone mineral density (BMD), and that the average serum DHEAS level was 60% lower in women with low BMD compared with those with normal bones. Also of note is the fact that, although there was no relationship between estrogen levels and BMD in this study, women with low DHEAS values were 40 times more likely to have osteoporosis than were women with normal DHEAS lev- els.78 Another study of 29 postmenopausal women demonstrated sig- nificant positive correlation between bone mineral content in the distal radius and ulna and age-adjusted serum DHEA levels.79 More recent studies continue to expand upon these findings by documenting the positive correlation between androgen levels and BMD in postmeno- pausal women who do not have Addison’s disease, thus suggesting an essential role for DHEA, testosterone, or both, in the maintenance of bone mass in postmenopausal women. It appears that free testosterone levels are more significantly correlated with increased bone mass in the lumbar spine, whereas DHEAS levels tend to correlate with increased bone mass in the femoral neck, both notable areas of concern in terms of the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.75 Although testosterone was shown to have receptor sites on osteoblasts, the lack of an analogous receptor for DHEA leaves the mechanism by which DHEA contributes to bone production and maintenance as a matter of some speculation. Possible theories include functioning as a precursor molecule for the formation of estradiol and various androgens in systemic circulation, a direct promotion of bone formation by increasing levels of IGF-1 while inhibiting skeletal cata- bolic IL-6,80,81 or possibly an intracrine mechanism involving an inter- action with vitamin D3 to enhance the conversion of DHEA to estrone in osteoblasts.82 Recommendations pertaining to the clinical use of DHEA for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are less clear due to mixed results in controlled trials and a lack of both long-term studies and good data in terms of fracture risk reduction. One double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled study of 50 mg/day DHEA supplementation demon- strated improved bone turnover and decreased osteoclastic activity in women older than 70 years.39 In another, treatment using transdermal DHEA cream for 1 year in postmenopausal women demonstrated sig- nificantly increased serum osteocalcin levels and BMD of the femur, while simultaneously demonstrating a decrease in bone alkaline phos- phatase levels.83 A recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial in healthy adults age 55 to 85 years showed that oral dosing of 50 mg/day DHEA for a year increased lumbar spine BMD in women only. There was no effect on femoral neck or total body BMD in women and no significant changes in BMD were noted at any site in the men studied.84 A study that selected exclusively men and women with lower levels of DHEA demonstrated a notably different result using the same 50 mg/ day dose, in that BMD in the lumbar spine was improved in both men and women compared with placebo, as was hip BMD in women.85 Unfortunately, neither of these studies looked at or directly mentioned fractures or fracture risk in their subjects, although there was one indi- rect mention of DHEA supplementation leading to increased serum IGF-1 levels and the positive correlation between lower IGF-1 levels and risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women.86

## Erectile Dysfunction

The Massachusetts Male Aging Study, conducted from 1987 to 1989, was the first to describe an inverse correlation between DHEAS levels and the incidence of erectile dysfunction. More than half of the men in this study had minimal, moderate, or complete impotence,87 and the degree of impotence was directly correlated with lower serum DHEAS

levels. Follow-up research suggested that this was especially true for men younger than 60 years.88 More recently, it has also been shown that men with higher levels of testosterone and DHEA and decreased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) reportedly perceived better general health, emotional support, intimacy, satisfaction with life, resilience, and a better relationship quality, all of which should be considered clinically in any CAM practice.89 One double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that oral DHEA supplementation at 50 mg/day for 6 months resulted in improvement in all five domains of the International Index of Erectile Function, which quantitatively describes an individual’s ability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual perfor- mance.90,91 Response was most substantial in individuals with hyper- tension or lack of an organic etiology for their condition.90 There was no effect of DHEA treatment on serum prostate specific antigen, pro- lactin, testosterone, mean prostate volume, or mean postvoid residual urine volume.91 A more recent placebo-controlled randomized trial of 50 mg DHEA twice a day demonstrated no benefit compared with either testosterone or placebo.92


Administration of DHEA reduced the severity of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits.60 In another rabbit model, low-dose DHEA mitigated the damaging biochemical and structural effects of a high-fat diet.93 DHEAS was also shown to have digitalis-like activity, accounting for 62% to 100% of the total plasma digitalis-like factors in 11 healthy adults.64 A study reviewing serum DHEA and DHEA supplementation found that DHEA has antiremodeling and vasorelaxant qualities.94 Mean plasma DHEAS levels are significantly lower in men with a history of heart disease than in men without such a history. One study found that in men with no history of heart disease at baseline, a low plasma DHEAS level (<140 mcg/dL) was associated with a more than threefold increase in the age-adjusted risk of death from car- diovascular disease.95 Similar findings were reported by others,96–100 although some investigators described only a modest protective effect of DHEA.101,102 The association between DHEAS and cardiovascular disease in women is less clear.103 Cardiovascular death rates might actually be greatest in women with both low and high DHEAS compared with those with intermediate levels.104,105 Although studies exploring the relationship between endogenous DHEA levels and cardiovascular risk factors have been encouraging in terms of demonstrating decreased carotid intima-media thickness106 and less atherogenic lipid profiles,107 recent randomized double-blind trials in hypoadrenal women did not demonstrate this benefit with the administration of oral DHEA. Several studies actually showed a tendency toward more atherogenic lipid profiles in terms of statistically significant decreases in the partic- ipant’s high-density lipoprotein levels,102,108 whereas another random- ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of longer duration found no significant changes in the lipid values of postmenopausal women who took 50 mg/day of oral DHEA for an entire year.109 There appear to be numerous reasons to continue the study of DHEA administration for the prevention and treatment of cardio- vascular disease, but there are currently few clinical data that support the routine use of DHEA, particularly when given the myriad of both pharmaceutical and complementary and alternative options that are available for this purpose.


DHEA supplementation for cancer, although mostly positive, does have a few concerns, particularly in regards to breast cancer and poten- tially other hormone-related cancers.110–113 There are premenopausal women with breast cancer that had significantly lower plasma levels of DHEA than age-matched controls without breast cancer, whereas postmenopausal women had significantly higher DHEA levels than age-matched controls.114 In another study, women with DHEA lev- els in the highest tertile were 60% less likely to develop breast cancer than were women in the lowest tertile.115 In a prospective case–con- trol study, serum DHEA and DHEAS levels were significantly lower in individuals who subsequently developed bladder cancer than in those who did not.116 These findings suggest that DHEA has anticancer activity and that low DHEA levels may be a risk factor for cancer, except in post- menopausal women. However, it is obvious that further research is required before guidelines can be developed regarding DHEA ther- apy and cancer. The observation that some postmenopausal women with breast cancer have elevated DHEA levels, as well as the fact that DHEA is converted in part to estrogen and testosterone, should be cause for concern. It is unknown whether the anticancer effects of DHEA are stronger than the potential prostate cancer–promoting effects of additional testosterone or the breast cancer–promoting effects of additional estrogen. This is a complicated issue, because the metabolism of DHEA is usually “cross-gender” (i.e., women get an increase in testosterone whereas estrogen levels often do not change, and vice versa for men). Until these questions can be answered, DHEA therapy should be approached with caution in patients who have either been diagnosed with or who are at risk for developing hormone-dependent cancers.

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

Although a 2009 case–control study demonstrated no significant correlation between serum DHEAS levels and the future likelihood of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), decreased serum DHEAS concentrations were demonstrated in patients with RA,117–119 possi- bly due to increased aromatase activity in the synovial tissue and the subsequent conversion of DHEA into estrogens, which may in turn stimulate the inflammatory process in patients with RA.120–122 From a clinical perspective, the real issue at hand continues to be whether these low DHEA levels are a consequence of RA rather than a predis- posing factor to the disease and whether or not DHEA administration is beneficial in patients with RA.118 It is worth noting that several studies on RA demonstrated pro- tective or even therapeutic effects of DHEA in rodents with experi- mentally induced arthritis.123,124 One study noted a clear benefit from the administration of about 10 mg/day, an amount roughly equivalent to 2500 mg/day for a 75-kg human being.124 Despite these potentially encouraging results and the fact that some practitioners have observed patients with RA who exhibited clinical improvement after treatment with DHEA, there are no controlled trials in humans demonstrating either a lack of efficacy or the same positive effects on disease activity that have been shown in murine models of RA.125

## Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory con- nective tissue disorder that occurs predominantly in women. A posi- tive effect of DHEA administration in autoimmune conditions such as SLE is likely due to a decrease in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, and cytokine-mediated antibody, thus DHEA has the potential for a positive effect on the clinical manifesta- tions of antibody-mediated diseases.24,126,127 Several studies demonstrated efficacy in patients with SLE when treated with 50 to 200 mg/day DHEA.127–133 A double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of women with SLE demonstrated that the group receiving DHEA had a significant reduction in the number of disease

flares and serious lupus-related adverse events, as well as improve- ment in the person’s global assessment.132 However, a recent review of randomized controlled trials comparing DHEA with placebo in persons with SLE demonstrated little to no effect on measures of dis- ease activity, but did demonstrate an improvement in quality-of-life measures.134 It was also noted that DHEA-treated subjects reported twice the rate of androgenic side effects compared with those given placebo.135

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease

DHEAS concentrations are decreased in patients with both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC).136 In one study, 200 mg/day DHEA was given orally for 56 days to 7 patients with active Crohn’s disease and 13 patients with active UC, all of whom were refractory to con- ventional drugs. The treatment response rate was 85.7% (6 of 7) for Crohn’s disease and 61.5% (8 of 13) for UC. No patient withdrew from the study because of side effects.137 The mechanism of action may result from the ability of DHEA to decrease mediators of inflammation. It was shown that DHEA inhib- its the activation of nuclear factor- κβ and the secretion of IL-6 and IL-12.24


Although DHEA appears to be safe, the long-term effects of moderate to high dosages are unknown. In the elderly, 50 mg/day will increase DHEA levels into the reference range of young adults.6 Although some practitioners routinely prescribe 50 mg/day for healthy women and 100 mg/day for healthy men, such doses may be supraphysiolog- ical. Dosages of 5 to 25 mg/day for women and 10 to 50 mg/day for men appear to be safe.35 Topical DHEA can be safely applied to the skin or inserted vaginally, at a dosage of 0.25% to 1%, for up to 3 to months.76,138 Patients with SLE or other autoimmune diseases some- times need as much as 200 mg/day or more to obtain benefit. Large doses should be split into twice-daily dosing, usually morning and evening. Studies show that orally administered DHEA is well absorbed,139 and that once in circulation, DHEA readily penetrates the blood–brain barrier.140,141


With some exceptions, both oral and topical administration of DHEA appears to be relatively safe for clinical use.35 In one study, administration of 1600 mg/day for 28 days to healthy volunteers resulted in some degree of insulin resistance but no other signifi- cant side effects. A 2009 study giving postmenopausal women mg/day of oral DHEA for a year demonstrated no significant effects on either insulin, glucose, or lipid values.109 The same study also documented no significant difference in endometrial proliferation compared with placebo. In several SLE studies, 200 mg/day given for a number of months was generally well tolerated, with the exception of mild to moderate acne and occasional mild hirsutism. Another study reported intermittent nausea, perioral dermatitis, subjective feelings of aggressiveness, and intermittent hoarseness.137 According to several reports, there is a possibility that cardiac arrhythmias and anxiety may be exacerbated by DHEA supplementation.142,143 A pos- itive association was reported between adrenal androgen levels and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women, particularly those over age 45.144 Because DHEA is a known precursor to more potent sex hormones, its use should probably be avoided in individuals with hormone-sensitive cancers.


Estrogen (oral contraceptive pills, hormone replacement therapy), free testosterone, and DHEA levels were reduced in women taking estrogen.145 All medications used to treat hormone-sensitive cancers includ- ing estrogen receptor downregulators (Fulvestrant) and aromatase inhibitors. These drugs are used to interrupt the growth of hormone- dependent cancers. Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for many of the conversions in the steroid pathway. When taken with DHEA, aro- matase inhibitors may increase testosterone levels and reduce estrogen levels. More well-designed studies are needed to confirm this theory.146 DHEA may affect how insulin works in the body, and vice versa. Supplementation should be used with caution for those with condi- tions related to blood sugar dysregulation.147 Steroid sulfatase (STS) inhibitors are currently being developed for use in breast cancer therapy. STS controls the hydrolysis of DHEAS.148 DHEA may potentiate the action of thyroid hormones.149 Antidepressant medications, specifically those that increase sero- tonin levels. DHEA modulates the release of serotonin in hippocampal neurons and it is hypothesized that an increase in serotonin from sup- plementation may lead to serious side effects.150


In conclusion, DHEA appears to have potential as a therapy for numerous conditions. However, much remains to be clarified in terms of human applications, so it would seem appropriate to treat this pow- erful hormone with caution and respect to maximize its benefits and minimize its risks.

## 567CHAPTER 75 Echinacea Species (Narrow-Leafed Purple Coneflower)

a harmonious fashion to produce the phenomena of synergy. A key manner in which echinacea affects immune function is by enhancing the ability of macrophages to engulf and destroy particulate matter. The specific components of echinacea that possess this action are the polysaccharides, alkylamides, and cichoric acid. Although each com- ponent is effective alone, the greatest degree of enhancement was noted when the three active components were used in a specific ratio (0.25, 2.5, and 25 mg/mL).4 This phenomenon of synergy was noted with a clear dose-dependent effect. In other words, the effects with the three actives were greater than any individual active and the higher the dos- age, the greater the effect on enhancing macrophage function. A simi- lar effect was noted in the ability of macrophages to detect the presence of foreign matter in the blood and signal the other components of the immune system to mount an attack via interleukin-1 (IL-1) and gran- ulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Because echinacea contains a wide assortment of chemical con- stituents with confirmed immune-enhancing effects, this is import- ant for manufacturers to recognize to ensure sufficient levels of all these active compounds. Unfortunately, most echinacea products on the market do not specify the levels of active compounds because they have not been analyzed for them. In addition, when manufac- turers do state the level of a particular marker compound, most con- sumers fail to realize that concentrating only for one particular active compound of echinacea results in the loss of other constituents and, as a result, all of the synergistic effects. For example, some manu- facturers standardize for “total phenolic content” or the compound echinacoside.5 Although these types of echinacea extracts were found to have some antioxidant properties, recent studies found them to have no effect on enhancing immune function in experimental ani- mal studies.6,7 The growing understanding of the chemical composition of echi- nacea requires manufacturers to perform quality control tests not only on the finished product but also on the plant to ensure that it is being grown properly and harvested at the exact time for maximal levels of all active compounds. It is imperative that echinacea be treated properly after harvesting. In addition, studies indicate that a significant amount of the active ingredients are destroyed in the drying process. If the fresh plant material is not processed imme- diately, the content of several key components—especially cichoric acid and alkylamides—will be low (as much as 80% will be lost).8–10 Chemical analysis of commercial echinacea preparations demon- strated tremendous variation in the levels of key compounds. For example, one analysis of various commercial echinacea products found that there was not only tremendous variation in the level of cichoric acid, with most products containing either none or little, but even within the same product, there was tremendous interbatch variation.11

## Polysaccharides

A number of immunostimulatory and mild anti-inflammatory poly- saccharides have been isolated from Echinacea spp.2,3,12–15 Most notable are inulin, which is found in a high concentration (5.9%) in E. angus- tifolia root, and the high-molecular-weight (25,000–50,000) polysac- charides found in the aerial part of E. purpurea. These components possess significant immune-enhancing properties. Typically, the most potent immune-enhancing polysaccharides are the water-soluble, acidic, branched-chain heteroglycans composed of many types of sug- ars rather than the polyfructose content of inulin.

## Alkylamides

Alkylamides typically exert a tingling sensation on the tongue, which is representative of their mild anesthetic effect. These compounds are found in highest concentrations in the roots. The roots of E. angustifo- lia contain higher concentrations (0.004%–0.039%) than E. purpurea (0.009%–0.151%) and E. pallida (0.001%).16,17 Alkylamides are among the most active constituents of echinacea on macrophage function.18 In a human pharmacokinetic study, alkylamides were detected in plasma 20 minutes after ingestion of an echinacea preparation and indicated that dosing at least three times a day was required to maintain plasma concentrations.19

## Caffeic Acid Derivatives

Caffeic acid serves as the backbone for a number of important medic- inal plant compounds in other plants and Echinacea spp. (Fig. 75.1). The first compound believed to be unique to Echinacea is echinaco- side, a compound eventually shown to be composed of caffeic acid, a caffeic acid derivative (similar to catechol), glucose, and rhamnose, all attached to a central glucose molecule.20 Echinacoside accumulates in the roots but is also found in smaller concentrations in the flowers. The roots of E. angustifolia contain 0.3% to 1.3%, whereas the roots of E. pallida contain a similar concentration of 0.4% to 1.7%.12 It is assumed that E. purpurea has similar echinacoside levels as well. Other caffeic acid derivatives important in the pharmacology of Echinacea include cichoric acid, chlorogenic acid, and cynarin.3 Cichoric acid was originally isolated from E. purpurea and is found in much higher concentrations in this species compared with E. angus- tifolia and E. pallida.3,21 However, E. angustifolia and E. pallida have higher amounts of other types of caffeic acid derivatives. These differ- ences are not thought to have much clinical significance; rather, they may prove to be valuable in quick chemical differentiation of species.

## Flavonoids

The leaves and stems of E. angustifolia and E. purpurea have been shown to contain numerous flavonoids, with rutoside being the most abundant.3 The total flavonoid content (calculated as quercetin) for E. angustifolia and E. purpurea was 0.48% and 0.38%, respectively.3

## Essential Oils

The essential oil content varies among the three common species22: • E. angustifolia root and leaves contain less than 0.1%. • E. purpurea root contains 0.2%, and flowers and leaves contain 0.6%. • E. pallida root contains up to 2%, and the leaves contain less than 1%.

Interestingly, in one study, the essential oil content of E. pallida root was found to rise to 3.5% to 4% in April and May but fall to 1% to 1.5% for the rest of the year.23 The major essential oil components are sesquiterpene derivatives, borneol, α -pinine, and related aromatic compounds.3

## Polyacetylenes

A number of polyacetylenes have been identified from the roots of all three commercial species.24 The difference in the type of polyacetylene and susceptibility to breakdown may help differentiate which species is best for commercial use. Because the polyacetylenes of E. pallida are quite susceptible to autoxidation, E. angustifolia may be better for commercial products.25 Research showed that long-term storage greatly decreases the content of polyacetylenes to only trace levels at best. However, the polyacetylene derivatives of autoxidation of E. pall- ida are quite characteristic and useful in differentiating E. pallida from E. angustifolia.

# MISCELLANEOUS

Undoubtedly, other constituents contribute to the pharmacology of echinacea. The occurrence of a “colorless alkaloid” was first reported by the great John Uri Lloyd in 1897 and substantiated recently by the isolation of the alkaloids tussilagine and isotussilag- ine.26 Other compounds isolated from Echinacea spp. include the following3: • Resins • Glycoproteins • Sterols • Minerals • Fatty acids


Echinacea was used extensively by the Native Americans living in areas where it grew. American Indians used echinacea against more illnesses than any other plant. The root was used externally for the healing of wounds, burns, abscesses, and insect bites; internally for infections, toothache, and joint pains; and as an antidote for rattlesnake bites.27 H.C.F. Meyer, a German lay healer, introduced a commercial product containing echinacea to Americans around 1870. He recom- mended “Meyer’s blood purifier”3 as a wonder cure for almost every conceivable malady, and there were numerous case reports of success- ful treatments for snakebites, typhus, diphtheria, and other infections. E. angustifolia became a favorite with eclectic physicians because it was thought to be greater in activity than other species. Eclectics used it externally as a local antiseptic, stimulant, deodorant, and anesthetic and internally for “bad blood” (i.e., to correct “fluid deprivation with tendency to sepsis and malignancy”).28,29 Although many physicians began to investigate and use echinacea as a serious medicine, in 1909 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association refused to recognize echinacea as an active drug, stating: “In view of the lack of any scientific scrutiny of the claims made for it, Echinacea is deemed unworthy of further consid- eration until more reliable evidence is presented in its favor.” Despite this opposition, echinacea was included in the National Formulary of the United States and remained there until 1950.3 With the demise of the eclectic movement, the popularity of echina- cea in the United States waned except among naturopathic physicians until around 1980, when it was rediscovered because of increased con- sumer interest in immune system disorders such as candidiasis, chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and cancer. Although interest in echinacea decreased in America between the 1930s and 1980s, European physicians continued research.

## 569CHAPTER 75 Echinacea Species (Narrow-Leafed Purple Coneflower)

of this research was initiated by a 1932 study by Gerhard Madaus, who demonstrated immune-enhancing effects of a preparation from the fresh juice of the aerial portion of E. purpurea. This was followed by the development of a commercial product (Echinacin) and a great deal of scientific study. Thus E. purpurea began to be as respected as E. angustifolia among herbal practitioners in Europe.3


The chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical applications of echina- cea have been the subject of more than 300 scientific studies.2,3,30 This section summarizes some of the pharmacologic information on Echinacea, with attention to the species used, part of the plant used, solvent used for extraction, and other relevant features. When no species delineation is made, the activity described is similar in all species.

## Tissue Regeneration and Anti-inflammatory Properties

Echinacin (a commercial product consisting of the freshly pressed juice of E. purpurea stabilized in ethanol) and polysaccharide com- ponents of echinacea have been shown to promote tissue regenera- tion and reduce inflammation in experimental studies.31 This effect is apparently largely because of inhibition of the enzyme hyaluroni- dase via formation of a polysaccharide complex with hyaluronic acid, thereby maintaining the structure and integrity of the collagen matrix in connective tissue and ground substance. In addition to increased hyaluronic acid stabilization, echinacea also stimulates fibroblast growth and the manufacture of glycosaminoglycans, a critical goal in wound healing. Echinacea exerts a mild, direct cortisone-like effect and enhances the secretion of adrenal cortex hormones.3 The polysaccharide portion appears to be responsible for the direct anti-inflammatory effects, although the alkylamide fraction has also demonstrated some activity.32

<!-- chunk -->

## Immunostimulatory Properties

Echinacea possesses a broad spectrum of effects on the immune sys- tem as a result of its content of a diverse range of active components affecting different aspects of immune function.2,3 For example, inu- lin, the major component in the root of E. angustifolia, activates the alternative complement pathway and thus promotes chemotaxis of neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils; solubilization of immune complexes; neutralization of viruses; and bacteriolysis. Echinacea also increases the levels of properdin, the normal serum globulin that stim- ulates the alternative complement pathway.2,3,33 Another nonspecific immune enhancement is echinacea’s enhancement of serum leukocyte and granulocyte counts.2,3,30–34 The high-molecular-weight heteroglycan polysaccharide compo- nents of echinacea have profound immunostimulatory effects. The majority of these effects appear to be mediated by the binding of active echinacea polysaccharides to carbohydrate receptors on the cell surface of macrophages and T lymphocytes. However, some of the T-cell acti- vation found in early studies is now thought to be a result of a contam- inant protein. Later studies using a purer polysaccharide fraction did not show significant results.3 Echinacea promotes nonspecific T-cell activation (i.e., transfor- mation, production of interferon, and secretion of lymphokines). The resultant effect is enhanced T-cell mitogenesis, macrophage phagocy- tosis, antibody binding, natural killer cell activity, and increased num- bers of circulating neutrophils.3,30 Echinacea polysaccharides were also shown to enhance mac- rophage phagocytosis and to stimulate macrophages to produce increased amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon, and IL-1; destroy tumor cells in tissue culture; and inhibit Candida albicans infection in rats infected intravenously with a lethal dose (3 × 105 cells) of C. albicans.3,34 The interactions with macrophages were most likely responsible for much of the immune system enhancement of echina- cea polysaccharides. In addition to the polysaccharides, lipophilic alkylamides and caffeic acid derivatives like cichoric acid are thought to contribute to the immunostimulatory aspects of echinacea, especially alco- holic extracts.2,3,30 Although most research has been devoted to the water-soluble components such as polysaccharides, the lipo- philic fraction yields the most potent enhancement of macrophage phagocytosis.3,4 The carbon clearance test is often used to measure systemic mac- rophage activation. The method involves measuring the rate of disap- pearance of carbon granules from the blood at varying intervals after administration of the test substance. Root extracts of echinacea admin- istered orally tend to yield greater effects on phagocytic activity than the aerial portion, with E. purpurea greater than E. angustifolia, which is greater than E. pallida.3 Many studies used injectable preparations, but oral preparations are generally thought to yield similar or even better results, although direct comparisons are apparently not available. For example, intra- muscular Echinacin administered to healthy males on 4 successive days was shown to increase granulocytic phagocytosis by nearly 50%, whereas the oral administration of an E. purpurea root extract at a dose of 30 drops three times a day to healthy males for 5 consecutive days resulted in an increase of 120%.3 However, this difference might be because of the differing constituents of the forms used. The expressed juice of the aerial portion E. purpurea, as found in Echinacin, has lower concentrations of several of the phagocytosis-stimulating compounds characteristic to echinacea, including polysaccharides, alkylamides, and caffeic acid derivatives like cichoric acid, compared with the alco- holic extract.3 In general, echinacea appears to offer benefits for all infectious conditions. An exception to this statement may be AIDS. It is unclear at this time if echinacea should be recommended for AIDS. Although this condition is associated with widespread depression of the immune system, presumably because of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIC), stimulation of T-cell replication may also stimulate replica- tion of the virus as well. In addition, echinacea was shown to lower T-helper cells and decrease the ratios of T-helper cells to suppressor cells.2,3 Although there are anecdotal reports of echinacea’s efficacy in HIV-infected individuals, more research is necessary.

## Antiviral Properties

The juice of the aerial portion of E. purpurea, along with alcoholic and aqueous extracts of the roots, were shown to possess antiviral activity. Some of the viruses inhibited in cell cultures include influenza, her- pes, and vesicular stomatitis viruses.3,35 Although certain echinacea components (e.g., echinacoside, other caffeic acid derivatives, polysac- charides) might block virus receptors on the cell surface, the antivi- ral effects might also be a result of inhibition of hyaluronidases. The viral-inhibiting action of echinacea was significantly diminished when hyaluronidase was added to the cell cultures.3 Many organisms secrete hyaluronidase, which increases connective tissue permeability and allows the organism to become more invasive.36 Clinically, the inhibition of hyaluronidase coupled with general immunostimulation of echinacea is probably more important than direct antiviral activity. The nonspecific antiviral action of echinacea enhances cytotoxic killing of virus-infected cells and the release of inter- feron. Interferons bind to cell surfaces, where they stimulate the synthe- sis of intracellular proteins that block the transcription of viral RNA.

## Antibacterial Properties

The direct antibacterial activity of echinacea is quite mild. This is some- what surprising because echinacea has a long history of effective use in both internal and external bacterial infections. Possibly, it possesses antiinfective properties that prevent bacterial adherence, although this has yet to be determined. Clearly, its clinical efficacy is because of its strong immune-potentiating actions. Echinacea possesses mild antibacterial action due largely to echi- nacoside, the complex caffeic acid derivative, found in highest con- centrations in the root of E. angustifolia. Echinacoside and caffeic acid were shown to have antibacterial action against Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Proteus vulgaris. Approximately 6.3 mg of echinacoside is equivalent to 10 Oxford units of penicillin.3,20

## Antineoplastic Activity

Obviously, echinacea possesses indirect, antineoplastic activity via its general immuno-enhancing effects. Specifically important is its stimu- lation of macrophages to greater cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. (Z)-1,8-pentadecadiene, a lipid-soluble component found in the roots of E. angustifolia and E. pallida, was shown in vivo to possess signifi- cant direct antineoplastic activity.37

<!-- chunk -->

## Endocannabinoid System

The alkamides of echinacea have been reported to have cannabinomi- metic properties on both cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors.2 This effect is related to the structural similarity to the endogenous canna- binoid receptor ligand anandamide. In addition, these alkamides also inhibit the breakdown of anandamide. The clinical application of these effects on the ECS is in the treatment of anxiety and atopic dermatitis (both discussed later in the chapter).


At present, although the results from clinical research are mixed, given the long history, safety, and confirmed immune-enhancing effects in experimental models, and the numerous clinical studies that showed positive results, the clinical applications of echinacea include the following: • Treatment of the common cold and other viral respiratory tract infections • Possible prevention of the common cold and viral respiratory tract infections • Treatment of temporary immune deficiency and increased suscep- tibility to infections • Children attending daycare • Adults experiencing undue stress • Sport-induced immunodeficiency • Supportive therapy to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics in bacterial infections • Chemotherapy and radiation-induced immune suppression • Herpes simplex infections • Anxiety • Atopic dermatitis

## Upper Respiratory Tract Infections

Mixed results from clinical studies with echinacea were most likely because of lack of or insufficient quantity of active compounds. The axiom for the effectiveness of any herbal product is its ability to deliver an effective dose of active compounds. If the product, by chance, had sufficient levels of active compounds, it would be effective. If not, it would likely be no more effective than a placebo. For example, in one double-blind study, 160 subjects were given either echinacea or placebo and then exposed to a common cold virus. Infection occurred in 44 (57%) and illness occurred in 36 (43%) of the echinacea- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively. However, the preparation contained no echinacosides or alkamides and contained only 0.16% cichoric acid.38 In contrast, in a clinical trial using a well-defined echi- nacea extract containing alkamides, cichoric acid, and polysaccharides at concentrations of 0.25, 2.5, and 25 mg/mL, respectively, prepared from freshly harvested E. purpurea plants (commercially available as Echinilin or Echinamide), showed excellent results.39 In this random- ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 282 subjects, 18 to years old, with a history of two or more colds in the previous year but otherwise in good health, were randomized to receive either echinacea extract or placebo. They were instructed to start the echinacea or pla- cebo at the onset of the first symptom related to a cold, consuming doses the first day and 4 doses per day on subsequent days for 7 days. The severity of symptoms (10-point scale: 0, minimum; 9, maximum) and dosing were recorded daily. A nurse examined the subjects on the mornings of days 3 and 8 of their cold. A total of 128 subjects con- tracted a common cold (59 echinacea, 69 placebo). The total daily symptom scores were found to be 23.1% lower in the echinacea group than in the placebo group. Throughout the treat- ment, the response rate to treatments was greater in the echinacea group. This study indicated that early intervention with a standardized formulation of echinacea resulted in reduced symptom severity in sub- jects with naturally acquired upper respiratory tract infection. Again, to highlight the issue of quality control and source of preparation, several studies with less well-defined echinacea prod- ucts showed little benefit, especially in experimentally induced rhi- novirus infections. In another double-blind study, 302 volunteers from four military institutions and one industrial plant in Germany were given either a placebo or alcohol-based tinctures from either E. purpurea or E. angustifolia dried root for 12 weeks.40 The main outcome measure was time until the first upper respiratory tract infection. The secondary outcome measures were the number of par- ticipants with at least one infection, global assessment, and adverse effects. The time until occurrence of the first upper respiratory tract infection was 66 days in the E. angustifolia group, 69 days in the E. purpurea group, and 65 days in the placebo group. In the placebo group, 36.7% had an infection, whereas in the E. angustifolia group, it was 32%, and in the E. purpurea group, it was 29.3%. These results indicated that there was no significant benefit with either form of echinacea, although there was an approximately 20% reduced risk of infection in the echinacea groups. In addition, 70% of the E. pur- purea and 78% of the E. angustifolia group felt they had benefited from treatment compared with 56% in the placebo group. The E. angustifolia group had a slightly higher percentage of subjects experi- encing side effects (18%) compared with the E. purpurea (10%) and placebo (11%) groups. In one of the most detailed clinical trials, 719 patients were assigned to 1 of 4 parallel groups: no pills, placebo pills (blinded), echinacea pills (blinded), or echinacea pills (unblinded, open-label). Echinacea groups received 8 tablets on the first day and 4 tablets per day on the subsequent 4 days, each containing the equivalent of 675 mg of alco- holic extract of E. purpurea root (of dried roots) and 600 mg of alco- holic extract E. angustifolia root; the placebo group received the same number of tablets. The primary end point was defined as the “area under the curve” for global severity with duration and severity. Severity was assessed by the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 questionnaire and the duration by the participants’ impression of hav- ing a cold. The results showed only a statistically insignificant trend in reduction of the cold duration by half a day and a reduction of severity of approximately 10%.41

## 571CHAPTER 75 Echinacea Species (Narrow-Leafed Purple Coneflower)

The result from this trial indicated that a major issue with some of the echinacea research might be the echinacea preparations used (i.e., weak ethanol-based tinctures derived from dried root). Clinical studies in upper respiratory tract infections done on extracts of fresh E. purpurea whole plant or aerial plant, especially in liquid form, are consistently positive compared with those using dried echinacea spe- cies extracts (or powdered herbs), especially in solid forms (tablets or capsules). It is possible that echinacea may exert direct local effects and that its contact with the oropharyngeal lymphatic tissue is extremely important in acute upper respiratory tract infection conditions. Reasonably large and well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies found that preparations of echinacea from the aerial portion of the plant produced modest effects in aborting, and reducing, the symptoms and duration of colds.30,40,42 In addition to the previously described study with a well-defined echinacea preparation from the aerial portion of E. purpurea, another study showed good results when 108 patients with the initial symptoms suggesting a cold received either EchinaGuard—an extract of the fresh- pressed juice of E. purpurea—at a dosage of 4 mL twice daily or pla- cebo for 8 weeks.43 The percentages of patients who remained healthy were 35.2% of the echinacea group and 25.9% of the placebo group. The length of time between infections was 40 days for the echinacea group and 25 days for the placebo group. When infections did occur in patients receiving echinacea, they were less severe and resolved more quickly. Patients showing evidence of a weakened immune system (CD4/CD8 ratio <1.5) benefited the most from echinacea. The results from another trial were especially encouraging because it also suggested that echinacea could not only make colds shorter and less severe, but it could also sometimes stop a cold that was just starting.44 In this study, 120 people were given a preparation from the fresh-pressed juice of E. purpurea or a placebo as soon as they started showing signs of getting a cold. Participants took either echinacea or placebo at a dosage of 20 drops every 2 hours for 1 day, then 20 drops 3 times a day for 9 more days. Fewer people in the echinacea group felt that their initial symptoms actually developed into “real” colds (40% of those taking echinacea vs. 60% taking the placebo actually became ill). Also, among those who did come down with “real” colds, improvement in the symptoms started sooner in the echinacea group (4 days instead of 8 days). Both results were statistically significant. However, echinacea’s ability to shorten the duration of colds was more dramatic. Not all studies of the fresh-pressed juice of E. purpurea or EchinaGuard showed positive effects in reducing the duration or severity, or both, of upper respiratory infections. For example, a study in children 2 to 11 years old was particularly disappointing because the results indicated that it was not only ineffective, but its use was also associated with an increased risk of rash.45 In another double-blind trial, 128 patients received 100 mg of the freeze-dried pressed juice from the aerial portion of E. purpurea or a placebo three times daily until cold symptoms were relieved or until the end of 14 days, whichever came first.46 Symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, headache, sore or scratchy throat, hoarse- ness, muscle aches, and cough) were scored subjectively by the patient and recorded daily in a diary. No statistically significant difference was observed between treatment groups for either total symptom scores or mean individual symptom scores. The time to resolution of symptoms was also not statistically different. The failure in this trial might have been a result of the previously mentioned lack of direct contact with the oropharyngeal lymphatic system. Clearly, more research using well-characterized echinacea prepa- rations at appropriate dosages is necessary in well-designed trials. Currently, the “gold standard” for evaluating cold remedies involves inoculating healthy individuals with rhinovirus. Although the concen- tration of viral assault is much greater than what one might encoun- ter in the real world, any substance showing efficacy in this model is regarded as being highly efficacious. In one study, 48 healthy adults received the fresh-pressed juice of E. purpurea (EchinaGuard) or placebo, 2.5 mL 3 times per day, for 7 days before and 7 days after intranasal inoculation with rhinovirus (RV-39).47 A total of 92% of echinacea recipients and 95% of placebo recipients were infected. However, colds developed in 58% of echinacea recipients compared with 82% of placebo recipients. Although administration of echinacea before and after exposure to rhinovirus did not decrease the rate of infection, it did appear to reduce the clinical development of a cold. However, because of the small sample size, statistical hypothesis testing had relatively poor power to detect statistically significant differences in the frequency and severity of illness. As mentioned previously, the only other experimental rhinovirus infection and echinacea study was seriously marred because the preparation used contained no active components.38

## Candidiasis

Echinacea’s effect against C. albicans noted in animal studies was con- firmed in several human clinical studies.3 A study featured in Table 75.2 demonstrated that Echinacin greatly accentuated the efficacy of a topical antimycotic agent (econazole nitrate), decreasing reoccurrence from 60.5% to 5% to 16.7%. The researchers used standardized skin tests to show that this enhancement was a result of echinacea’s boost- ing of cell-mediated immunity.48 Also of interest was the similarity in the efficacies of both the oral and injectable forms.


Several uncontrolled clinical studies substantiated echinacea’s wound-healing activities.3,37,49,50 The largest (4598 patients) demon- strated that a salve of the juice of the aerial portion of E. purpurea had an 85% overall success rate in the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions, such as abscesses, folliculitis, wounds of all kinds, eczema, burns, herpes, and varicose ulcers of the leg.3

<!-- chunk -->

## Arthritis

Echinacea’s anti-inflammatory activity was shown in uncontrolled studies to be useful in rheumatoid arthritis. In one study, 15 drops of Echinacin three times daily resulted in a 21.8% decrease in inflamma- tion. Although this improvement was less than cortisone (42%) and prednisone (49.2%), no side effects were associated with Echinacin, whereas both of these drugs have well-known side effects.51

## 572SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


Several studies noted a stimulatory effect of echinacea on leukocyte counts in patients receiving radiation for cancer therapy.49,52 A study using the commercial preparation Esberitox demonstrated that 85% of 55 patients showed a stabilization of leukocyte counts compared with the control group, which showed a steady decline in levels (starting at 6000 and decreasing to 2500 after 45 days).49 This strongly supports the recommendation of echinacea to patients undergoing orthodox cancer treatments. In an open prospective study with matched his- torical controls, an injection of polysaccharide fraction isolated from the herb E. purpurea was shown to counteract the undesired effects of chemotherapy.53 Fifteen patients with advanced gastric cancer, who underwent palliative chemotherapy with etoposide, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil, received daily intravenous injections of 2 mg of a poly- saccharide fraction isolated from E. purpurea herb cell cultures for days (beginning 3 days before chemotherapy). The median number of leukocytes 14 to 16 days after chemotherapy was 3630/mL in the patients who received echinacea polysaccharide compared with 2370/ mL (870–3950) in the patients of the historical control group. These results suggest that echinacea might be effective in reducing chemo- therapy-induced leukopenia.

## Anxiety

The anxiolytic effects of echinacea alkamides were demonstrated in animal studies. In rats, an alkamide-rich preparation of E. angusti- folia root decreased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and amelio- rated contextual conditioned fear models with no toxicity or adverse effects on behavior noted even when rats treated at dosages of and 3000 mg/kg. The extract was without effect in tests of locomotion (open-field), memory (object recognition), and rewarding potential (conditioned place preference) within a wide dose range. In human studies, 20 or 40 mg of the same E. angustifolia extract were adminis- tered for 1 week to volunteers scoring high on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The dosage of 40 mg per day decreased STAI scores within 3 days in human subjects, an effect that remained stable for the duration of the treatment (7 days) and for the 2 weeks that fol- lowed treatment. The lower dose, 20 mg per day, did not affect anxi- ety significantly.54

## Atopic Dermatitis

In the skin, the main physiological function of the ECS is to control the proliferation, differentiation, survival, and immune competence and/ or tolerance of skin cells. Loss of ECS exacerbates allergic skin reac- tions, whereas enhanced ECS function leads to alleviation of these same symptoms. To prove the benefit of a topically applied alkamide-rich E. purpurea extract, an in vitro study was conducted on keratinocytes fol- lowed by an assessment of cutaneous tolerability, clinical efficacy, and the effects on stratum corneum structure and lipid in subjects suffering from atopic dermatitis.55 The study demonstrated a significant anti-inflammatory activity of the alkamide-rich extract, a low allergenic potential in the study of vol- unteers similar to placebo skin creams, no phototoxicity, and an ability to reduce the main dermatological symptoms associated with atopic dermatitis (erythema, edema/papules, weeping/crusts, excoriation, lichenification, dryness, pruritus) in a 3-month double-blind study involving 60 subjects with subacute or chronic atopic dermatitis. The improvements were sustained for up to 85 days. An explanation of the long-standing improvements was offered in the clinical assessment of skin barrier function, levels of overall lip- ids, ceramide, and cholesterol. These were all significantly increased from baseline at day 15 following a twice-daily application of the alka- mide-rich cream.

## Snakebites

Echinacea has quite a reputation among naturopathic physicians and Native American healers for the treatment of snakebites. No controlled clinical studies of this use have been reported, but echinacea’s inhibi- tion of hyaluronidase might account for much of its reputed efficacy because most snake venoms permeate the system as a result of hyal- uronidase in the venom breaking down the connective tissue of the ground substance.

# COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS

As evident from the previous discussion, determining which echina- cea preparation is best is difficult. It is not only difficult to determine which species is most effective, but also the portion of the plant used and how it is prepared are serious issues. Dosage recommendations for all currently available forms follow, along with a few observations regarding the “preparations controversy.” Another problem that needs to be addressed is quality control. Since as early as 1904, many commercial sources of echinacea have contained adulterants and no echinacea. For example, it was estimated that because of supplier errors in collection, more than 50% (and pos- sibly as high as 90% at times) of the echinacea sold in the United States from 1908 to 1991 was actually Parthenium integrifolium, or Missouri snakeroot.54 Some suggested that this adulteration was because of con- fusion of the common names. Others pointed out that although the P. integrifolium plant looks quite different, “once the root is cut and sifted it has an uncanny resemblance to E. angustifolia or E. pallida roots, though it possesses its own characteristic flavor and fragrance.”56 From practical and clinical viewpoints, physicians should require adequate documentation from suppliers that they are, in fact, supplying echina- cea and its species.

<!-- chunk -->

## Species

Although studies have shown various echinacea species, or components found in higher concentrations in one species, to be more effective than others, each commercial species has its advantages and disadvan- tages. No “best” species can be recommended at this time because dif- fering experimental models have yielded inconsistent results. Rather, the clinician must recognize the unique value of each species. Although E. angustifolia has long been considered the best species and to possess the greatest activity, some studies dispute this. For example, several studies showed E. purpurea to demonstrate greater enhancement of phagocytosis. In one study, an aqueous extract of E. angustifolia did not demonstrate any effect on phagocytic function in rats, whether it was administered orally, intraperitoneally, or intravenously.57 Because E. purpurea is the easiest to grow commercially, it may become the most used in the United States, as it is in Europe.

The portion of the plant that possesses the greatest immune- enhancing properties depends on the experimental model. The key points, as described earlier, are that various echinacea components exert immune-enhancing effects, and there is clearly a synergistic effect among these constituents.

## Preparations

Echinacea products are available in many different forms: • Crude plant in either ground or powdered form • Freeze-dried • Alcohol-based tinctures and liquid extracts • Aqueous tinctures and liquid extracts • Dry, powdered alcoholic or aqueous

It is popular to standardize hydro-/alcoholic extracts for echinaco- side (for E. angustifolia) or cichoric acid (for E. purpurea). Although these extracts are thought by their proponents to be the most potent, it must be noted that other components have shown greater effects in some experimental models, and even 4 to 10× homeopathic prepara- tions have been shown to produce activity.32

## Solvents

Which solvent is best to use? Again, this question is extremely diffi- cult to answer because both hydrophilic and lipophilic components have been shown to possess immune-enhancing activities. Even a small amount of ethanol results in the precipitation or breakdown of the immuno-active polysaccharides, suggesting that aqueous extracts may be best. However, an aqueous extract would leave behind valuable lipophilic immune-enhancing alkylamides and caffeic acid derivatives. To optimize an extract’s immune-enhancing effects, many manufac- turers use low-ethanol (10%–20%) hydro-/alcoholic mixtures or com- bine a low-ethanol extract with a high-ethanol extract. Both products typically contain both polar and lipophilic compounds.


Box 75.1 lists dosages of echinacea as a general immune stimulant during infection. The question of whether echinacea should be used on a long-term or continual basis really depends on the need. In a healthy individual with no apparent depression of the immune system, con- tinual administration is certainly not indicated. However, it appears that individuals with impaired immune function do benefit from long- term use. The usual recommendation with long-term use is 8 weeks on, followed by 1 week off, but there is no real basis for the week off.

## Toxicology

When used at the recommended doses, there is no danger of toxicity because no studies have reported acute or chronic toxicity reactions caused by echinacea extracts. Echinacin, given intravenously, resulted in fever (0.5°C–1°C elevation in body temperature) on occasion. This was presumably a result of secretion of interferon- α and IL-1 by acti- vated macrophages.3 The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) of intravenous Echinacin was deter- mined to be 50 mL/kg body weight in mice and rats. The polysac- charides in E. purpurea (aerial portion) were shown to have an LD 50 of 1000 to 2500 mg/kg when given peritoneally to mice. Long-term administration of Echinacin to rats at doses many times the human therapeutic doses gave no evidence of any toxic effects. Mutagenic tests have demonstrated no mutagenic activity.2,3 Modern reviews of the safety and efficacy of Echinacea spp. found no toxicity in both adults and children in cases of both acute and long- term administration.2,30,58–60 Given the number of echinacea doses consumed yearly (>10 million) and the number of adverse events (<100), echinacea appears extremely safe. Reported side effects are also uncommon and usually limited to minor gastrointestinal symp- toms, increased urination, and mild allergic reactions. However, severe allergic reactions have occurred occasionally, some of them life threat- ening. Allergic reactions were often reported in people who were also allergic to other members of plants in the daisy (Compositae) family (e.g., daisy, ragweed, marigolds). The German Commission E warns against using echinacea in cases of autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheu- matoid arthritis. These warnings are theoretical because there is no evidence that echinacea use has actually harmed anyone with these diseases. Echinacea appears to be safe even for pregnant or lactating women based on both animal studies and evaluation studies in women using echinacea during pregnancy showing no harmful effects.61

## Drug Interactions

Echinacea preparations appear to have a low potential for drug inter- actions.62 Currently, there are no verifiable reports of drug–herb inter- actions with any echinacea product. Theoretically, echinacea may interfere with drugs that are purposely used to suppress the immune system. These include cyclosporin, which is used in patients who have had organ transplants to prevent the immune system from rejecting the transplanted organ.

## 575CHAPTER 76 Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian Ginseng)

Brekhman’s research with adaptogens began with P. ginseng because this was the best-known natural adaptogen. After confirming the adap- togenic action of panax in human studies, Brekhman began searching for an alternative to this plant because of the difficulty and expense in obtaining panax. Initially, all six species of Araliaceae native to Russia were investigated, and eleuthero was found to be the most promising. Numerous studies (in vivo, in vitro, and human studies) have been con- ducted since the late 1950s, nearly all in the Soviet Union. They are not referenced here because they are not translated and not widely available. Instead, review articles and original articles in English are cited.1–7


As mentioned earlier, several experimental and clinical studies demon- strated that eleuthero possesses adaptogenic properties (i.e., the ability to increase nonspecific body resistance to stress, fatigue, and disease). Additional experimental and clinical research supports additional therapeutic applications of E. senticosus.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adaptogenic Activity

In experimental models, E. senticosus was found to do the following: • Impede adrenal hypertrophy induced by adrenocorticotropic hor- mone and adrenal atrophy induced by cortisone • Impede thyroid hypertrophy induced by thyroidin and thyroid gland atrophy induced by 6-methylthiouracil • Reduce blood glucose levels in alimentary and adrenal hyperglyce- mia and increase glucose levels in insulin-induced hypoglycemia • Reduce leukocytosis induced by the parenteral administration of milk and leukopenia induced by endotoxins • Reduce erythrocytosis induced by cobaltous nitrate and erythrope- nia induced by phenylhydrazine Adaptogenic activities are summarized in Table 76.2. Similar results were obtained with P. ginseng (see Chapter 110). In addition to adaptogenic activities, eleuthero, like panax, has been shown to do the following1: • Increase resistance to infection in animals • Reduce hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis • Increase reproductive capacity and sperm counts in bulls • Possess significant antioxidant activity • Stimulate DNA synthesis and cellular repair enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress Control

Another important action of adaptogens is the inhibition of the alarm phase of the stress reaction. Eleuthero was shown to increase the swim- ming time of rats, reduce activation of the adrenal cortex in response to stress (alarm-phase reaction), and prevent stress-induced thymic and lymphatic involution.1–6

## Radiation Protection

Eleuthero has demonstrated both protective and therapeutic actions in animals exposed to both single and prolonged radiation. In one study, both E. senticosus and P. ginseng were found to double the life span of rats exposed to prolonged radiation (total doses of 1620–7000 rads).7 When eleuthero was combined with antibiotics, the lifetime of irra- diated rats (total dose of 3000 rads over 60 days) increased threefold. Eleuthero may therefore be of benefit in protecting against harmful radiation and as an adjunctive aid in radiation therapy in oncology.

with edema and inflammation, and certain inflammatory signals induce large increases in permeability by disrupting the integrity of the lymphatic endothelial barrier. Tie2 is an endothelial-specific receptor that, when activated, stabilizes lymphatic vessels. In vitro, E. senticosus and its component eleutheroside E induce phosphory- lation of Tie2.8 In addition, Siberian ginseng was found to stabilize lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) by promoting the intercellular localization of vascular endothelial cadherin (an endothelial-spe- cific cell–cell adhesion molecule) and induce the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase by LECs, effects mediated by the activation of Tie2. Researchers in this same study also investigated whether eleuthero powder improves edema in a two-way, random- ized, crossover study in 50 healthy female volunteers. Compared with the control group, edema of the lower limbs was significantly attenuated at 2 and 4 hours after ingestion of Siberian ginseng powder.

## Carcinogenesis Inhibition

Eleuthero preparations were shown to inhibit several cancer types in experimental studies in animals.1,3 Some of the anticancer effects of eleuthero may be because of its immune-stimulating effects. In vitro, Siberian ginseng increased phagocytosis of Candida albi- cans by granulocytes and monocytes from healthy donors by 30% to 45%.9,10 In vitro studies showed that whole ethanolic fluid extract of E. senticosus could induce and enhance the production of interleu- kin-1 and interleukin-6 but not interleukin-2.11 A methanolic extract of Siberian ginseng conferred growth inhibitory effects against a number of lung and colon cancer cell lines in vitro, with increasing concentration displaying a nonlinear inhibition in cancer cell differ- entiation from 12.5 to μ g/mL.12

## Adaptogenic Activity in Healthy Individuals

A fluid extract (33% ethanol) of E. senticosus root was administered to more than 2200 human subjects in clinical trials conducted in Russia designed to evaluate the adaptogenic effects of eleuthero. The male and female subjects ranged in age from 19 to 72 years. Dosages of the fluid extract (33% ethanol) ranged from 2 to 16 mL, one to three times a day, for periods of up to 60 consecutive days. The data indicated that eleuthero had the following effects: • Increased the ability of humans to withstand many adverse physical conditions (e.g., heat, noise, motion, workload increase, exercise, decompression) • Increased mental alertness and work output • Improved the quality of work under stressful conditions and improved athletic performance A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was designed to examine the effects of E. senticosus supplementation (800 mg/d) on the endurance capacity, cardiovascular functions, and metabolism of recreationally trained males for 8 weeks.13 Although the cohort was small (9 subjects), there was a significant improvement in VO 2 peak (12% elevation) and endurance time (23% improvement) and a 4% increase in the highest heart rate. It was concluded that weeks of eleuthero supplementation enhances endurance capacity, ele- vates cardiovascular functions, and alters the metabolism for sparing glycogen. Although several studies reported no effect of E. senticosus supplementation on endurance performance, it seems that the ergo- genic effects are dependent on the duration of supplementation and not just the dose.

## Adaptogenic Activity in Disease States

A fluid extract (33% ethanol) of E. senticosus root was administered to more than 2200 human subjects with various illnesses, including angina, hypertension, hypotension, acute pyelonephritis, various types of neuroses, acute craniocerebral trauma, rheumatic heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and cancer.1 Eleuthero appeared to be effective in atherosclerotic conditions, as evidenced by its ability to lower elevated serum cholesterol and prothrombin levels, reduce blood pressure, and eliminate anginal symptoms in human subjects. Its action on blood pressure was found to be truly adaptogenic because eleuthero was also shown to increase blood pressure in subjects with hypotension. Its effect in regulating blood pressure might be indicative of improved renal function. Patients with acute pyelonephritis given eleuthero extract had increased renal capacity, as measured by an increased secretion of phenol red.1 Eleuthero appears to have some psychotropic action because it was proven effective in the treatment of various psychological disturbances. Eleuthero consistently demonstrated an ability to increase one’s sense of well-being, regardless of the psychological complaint (e.g., insom- nia, hypochondriasis, various neuroses). This may be the result of improved balance of the biogenic amines, including serotonin, dopa- mine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, because eleuthero extract administered to rats was shown to increase biogenic amine content in the brain, adrenals, and urine.1 Extracts of E. senticosus have been reported to reduce urinary excre- tion of calcium and hydroxyproline in glucocorticoid-induced osteo- porotic rats.14 An additional study investigated the prevention of bone loss by a standardized extract of dried E. senticosus stem bark (DES) in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of osteoporosis.15 Eight weeks of treatment with DES significantly decreased the bone mineral density loss in the femur and inhibited bone markers such as serum alpha- fetoprotein (ALP), osteocalcin, and telopeptides of collagen type I levels

compared with the OVX control group without the influence of hor- mones such as estrogen. Oral administration of DES did not affect body weight gain, uterotrophic activity, or serum estradiol concentrations. Data are insufficient to fully evaluate eleuthero’s action in other disease states. However, it must be kept in mind that an adaptogen is nonspecific in its action and possesses a normalizing action regardless of the direction of the changes from physiological norms.


The standard dosage of the fluid extract (33% ethanol) of E. senticosus roots used in most studies ranged from 2 to 4 mL (up to 16 mL), one to three times a day, for periods of up to 60 consecutive days. In mul- tiple-dosing regimens, there is usually a 2- to 3-week interval between courses.1,4 Dosages include the following: • Dried root: 2 to 4 g • Tincture (1:5): 10 to 20 mL • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL • Solid (dry-powdered) extract (20:1): 100 to 200 mg


Toxicity studies in animals demonstrated that eleuthero extracts are vir- tually nontoxic. The median lethal dose of the 33% ethanol extract of eleuthero is 14.5 mL/kg in mice and greater than 20 mL/kg in rats. No long-term toxicity was observed when a daily dose of 5 mL/kg of the fluid extract was administered to rats. Teratogenicity was studied in three spe- cies (rats, rabbits, and minks), with no adverse effects observed.1 In human clinical studies, it was demonstrated that eleuthero extracts (33% ethanol) in the recommended dosage range were well tolerated, and side effects were infrequent. A few studies found mild side effects at higher dosages (4.5–6 mL three times daily) when used for long periods of time ( ≥ 60 days). Symptoms included insomnia, irritability, melan- choly, and anxiety. Pericardial pain, headaches, palpitations, and ele- vations in blood pressure were reported in individuals with rheumatic heart disease.1 These symptoms were likely a result of the mild stimulat- ing effects of eleuthero and, although not serious, indicated the need to decrease the dosage, allow a washout period, or both.


A clinical study in healthy humans indicated that extracts of eleuthero at generally recommended doses are unlikely to alter the levels of drugs primarily dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways for elimi- nation.16 However, in a case report, although a clear relationship could not be established, one person taking eleuthero with digoxin (Lanoxin) developed dangerously high serum digoxin levels.17 Therefore simulta- neous use with digoxin requires close medical supervision and regular monitoring of blood digoxin levels. In addition, eleutheroside B and eleutheroside E may inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized via CYP2C9 and CYP2E1 and have the potential to increase the toxicity of the drugs.18

and are widely used in both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications for asthma, hay fever, and rhinitis. In 1973 more than million prescriptions contained one of these alkaloids. In 2000 ephe- dra was found in at least 200 OTC products, and it was estimated that as many as two to three billion doses were consumed that year in the United States.

## Ephedrine

Ephedrine’s basic pharmacological action is that of a sympathomi- metic. Ephedrine stimulates both α - and β -adrenergic receptors, as well as the release of norepinephrine. Ephedrine shares many pharmacolog- ical actions with epinephrine, although ephedrine is much less active. Ephedrine also differs from epinephrine in its ability to be absorbed orally, its longer duration of action, and its more pronounced effect upon the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS effects of ephedrine are similar to those of amphetamines but, again, much less potent.2–5 Fig. 77.1 illustrates its chemical structure. The cardiovascular effects of ephedrine are also similar to those of epinephrine. It increases both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate, but for a longer (about 10 times) period of time. Like epinephrine, ephedrine increases coronary, cerebral, and muscle blood flow at the expense of renal and splanchnic blood flow.2–6 The bronchial muscle relaxation induced by ephedrine is much less than epinephrine, but, again, the duration of action is much longer. Other smooth muscles, except for the human uterus, are generally affected by ephedrine in the same manner (mild relaxation) as epi- nephrine. Ephedrine relaxes the human uterus, whereas the effects of epinephrine are more complex.2–5 Extracts of ephedra were shown to inhibit complement in vitro, and a Chinese herbal medicinal prescription, Makyo-kanseki-to, was found to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate activity.7,8 The principle adverse effects of ephedrine are CNS stimulation, nausea, tremors, tachycardia, and urinary retention.2,3 The major route of elimination of ephedrine is in the urine as the unchanged drug. The average half-life is 6 hours, although acidifying the urine decreases the half-life considerably. Alkalinization increases the half-life.9,10

## Pseudoephedrine

Pseudoephedrine exhibits bronchodilating activity similar to ephed- rine but has weaker pressor, cardiac, and CNS effects. Pseudoephedrine is often recommended over ephedrine in the treatment of chronic asthma because it has fewer side effects. Pseudoephedrine demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in various experimental models.9–11 Other ephedra alka- loids, including ephedrine, also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, although at much lower potency. Because the anti-inflammatory effect of pseudoephedrine is essentially identical in normal and adrenalecto- mized mice, the anti-inflammatory activity is not exerted via the adre- nal glands. Instead, it appears that the anti-inflammatory activity of pseudoephedrine and other ephedra alkaloids is caused by inhibition of prostaglandin E 2 synthesis.

## Asthma and Hay Fever

Ephedra and its alkaloids have proven effective as bronchodilators for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma and hay fever. The peak bronchodilation effect occurs in 1 hour and lasts about 5 hours after administration. The therapeutic effect of ephedra diminishes if used over a long period of time because of the weakening of the adrenal gland caused by ephedrine. Therefore it is often necessary to use ephedra in combina- tion with herbs such as Glycyrrhiza glabra and Panax ginseng and nutri- ents such as vitamin C, magnesium, zinc, vitamin B 6 , and pantothenic acid, which all support the adrenal glands. The folklore herbal treatment of asthma involved the use of ephedra in combination with herbal expectorants. Expectorants are herbs that modify the quality and quantity of secretions of the respiratory tract, resulting in the expulsion of the secretions and an improvement in respiratory tract function. Commonly used expec- torants include: • Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) • Grindelia camporum (grindelia) • Euphorbia hirta (euphorbia) • Drosera rotundifolia (sundew) • Polygala senega (senega)

## Common Cold

Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are components of many OTC prod- ucts for the self-treatment of the common cold. In China, ephedra, in combination with various other herbs, was found to be clinically effective in the treatment of cold symptoms, as well as those of influ- enza, pneumonia, whooping cough, and bronchitis.2 Polysaccharide from Ephedra sinica lowers the recruitment of inflammatory cells, decreases the production of TNF- α , IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-9, and sig- nificantly reduces the expression of TGF- β 1, P-Smad2, and P-Smad3, thus reducing airway and pulmonary inflammation.12

## Weight-Loss Aid

In both human and animal studies, ephedrine was shown to promote weight loss.3,13–21 Although ephedrine demonstrated an anorectic effect,13 its main mechanism for promoting weight loss appeared to be increasing the metabolic rate of adipose tissue.13–18 Therefore the weight-reducing effects of ephedra are most significant in those indi- viduals with a low basal metabolic rate.15 These effects can be greatly enhanced when used in combination with methylxanthines, caffeine, theophylline, and aspirin,15–20,22 which potentiate the action of ephed- rine and other ephedra compounds. In one animal study, when ephedrine was used alone, it resulted in a 14% decrease in body weight and a 42% decrease in body fat. However, when used in combination with caffeine or theophylline, the decreases were 25% and 75%, respectively.16 When either caffeine or theophylline was used alone, however, there was no significant loss in body weight. The greater decrease in body weight is likely a result of the increased metabolic rate and fat cell breakdown promoted by ephed- rine and enhanced by caffeine and theophylline. It is recommended that, for methylxanthines, Camellia sinensis (green tea) or extracts of Cola sp. be used rather than coffee or black tea. One of the better designed studies on the use of an ephedrine/ caffeine combination determined the safety and efficacy of an herbal supplement containing Ma Huang (90 mg/day ephedrine) and kola nut (192 mg/day caffeine) given to subjects for 6 months for weight loss.21 A total of 167 subjects were randomized to receive either a pla- cebo or ephedrine/caffeine combination. The subjects were monitored primarily for changes in blood pressure, heart function, and body weight. In addition to these parameters, body composition and meta- bolic changes were studied. Results demonstrated significant beneficial effects on body weight, body fat, and blood lipids of the herbal sup- plement in overweight men and women who were otherwise healthy. Herbal versus placebo treatment decreased body weight (−5.3 vs −2.6 kg), body fat (−4.3 vs −2.7 kg), and low-density lipoprotein choles- terol (−8 vs 0 mg/dL), and increased high-density lipoprotein choles- terol (+2.7 vs −0.3 mg/dL; P = 0.004). The ephedrine/caffeine mixture

produced small changes in blood pressure variables (+3 to −5 mm Hg) and increased heart rate (4 ± 9 beats/min), but cardiac arrhythmias were not increased. Compared with placebo treatment, the herbal supplement produced no adverse events and only minimal side effects consistent with the known stimulant action of ephedrine and caffeine (e.g., dry mouth, insomnia). A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran- domized study conducted at three clinical sites in New York state eval- uated the efficacy and side effects of an herbal formulation containing ephedrine, caffeine, and other ingredients to promote weight loss.23 One hundred and two overweight/obese volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 years were randomized to receive either the active prod- uct or a placebo supplement. Subjects receiving the active treatment experienced, on average, 1.5 kg of weight loss and greater reductions in BMI and waist circumference compared with subjects receiving the placebo. The benefits were achieved in the absence of any lifestyle, dietary, or exercise change. In addition, lower doses of ephedrine alka- loids and caffeine were used, and subjects experienced results without an increase in blood pressure, pulse, or the rate of adverse events. Obesity related human gut microbiota have been studied for identifi- cation of correlated bacteria and their mechanisms. It has been hypoth- esized that ephedra can have an influence on gut microbiota, and that influence may be associated with weight loss or metabolic markers or body composition indices. The antiobesity effects of ephedra via gut microbi- ota modulation was evaluated in a study of females between the ages of 40 and 65 who were weight-stable but obese.24 The subjects were asked to take 2 g of ephedra extract two times per day for 8 weeks. After ephe- dra intake, mean value of body weight was decreased by 1.86 kg, mean BMI was decreased by 0.79 kg/m2, and body fat was reduced by 1.17%. In correlation analysis, Subdoligranulum, Oscillibacter, and Akkermansia showed an association with changes of body weight and BMI. However, the influences of gut microbiota are unique according to indigenous microbiota and differences in individual sensitivity to ephedra.


The optimum dosage of ephedra depends on the alkaloid content in the form used. The average total alkaloid content of E. sinica is 1% to 3%. When used in the treatment of asthma or as a weight-loss aid, the ephedra dose should have an ephedrine content of 12.5 to 25 mg and be taken two to three times daily. For the crude herb, an equal dose would be approximately 500 to 1000 mg three times a day. Standardized preparations are often preferred because they have more dependable therapeutic activity.


Ephedra can produce the same side effects as ephedrine (e.g., increased blood pressure and heart rate, insomnia, anxiety). The FDA advisory review panel on nonprescription drugs recom- mended that ephedrine not be taken by patients with heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid disease, diabetes, or difficulty in urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland. Nor should ephedrine be used in patients on antihypertensive or antidepressant drugs. Pregnant women should also avoid the use of ephedra and ephedrine. Ephedrine administered to chick embryos resulted in cardiovascular teratogenicity and embryotoxicity at doses as low as μ mol/egg.25 The teratogenic effect of ephedrine is poten- tiated by caffeine.26 Presumably, this activity of ephedrine is the result of the production of nitrosamines.27 Simultaneous vitamin C administration might reduce the formation of nitrosamines from ephedra alkaloids.28,29 A key reason the FDA issued a ban on ephedra products was the tremendous amount (more than 2000) of adverse event reports (AERs) filed with the FDA related to the use of supplements con- taining ephedra alkaloids.30,31 However, when the Council of Responsible Nutrition studied the AERs filed with the FDA, it found that 98% of the AERs did not contain complete information, and in 81% of the reports, information on total daily intake of ephedra was not provided.32 Of the 1173 reports, 121 were selected for further evaluation. Of the 121 selected cases, 47 were considered to contain serious adverse events, including 15 cases of stroke and stroke-like symptoms, 13 cases of seizures, 15 cases of cardiac arrest, and 2 cases of individuals who collapsed. From the selected 121 cases, there were 8 reports of death: 6 were cardiovascular, 1 occurred in an automobile accident, and 1 was a spontaneous abortion. Among the 6 cardiovascular-related deaths, 5 were males and 1 was female. All 5 males who died from cardiovascular problems were using dietary supplements contain- ing ephedra as an athletic performance enhancer. Additionally, 4 of the 5 were simultaneously using other performance-enhancing products such as caffeine. Therefore their deaths cannot be directly attributed to the use of ephedra. After extensive examination of these AERs, the report could not conclusively determine whether there were any unexpected toxicological effects due to the ephedra contained in the dietary supplements based solely on the informa- tion presented in the AERs. Although there have been no large controlled studies on the pos- sible association between prescribed ephedrine/caffeine and cardio- vascular events in general, one study linked data from four different sources within Statistics Denmark on 257,364 users of prescribed ephedrine/caffeine for the period 1995 to 2002. The researchers analyzed the data using a case-crossover technique with a compos- ite endpoint: death outside of a hospital, myocardial infarction, or stroke. To account for effects of chronic exposure and effects in naïve users, the authors performed a secondary case-control study nested within the cohort of ephedrine/caffeine ever users. Among 2316 case subjects, 282 (12.2%) were current users of ephedrine/ caffeine. The case-crossover analysis yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 0.84. After adjustment for trends in ephedrine/caffeine use, the OR was 0.95. Subgroup analyses revealed no strata with significantly elevated risk. In the case-control substudy, there was no increased risk among naïve users or users with large cumulative doses. The analysis concluded that prescribed ephedrine/caffeine was not asso- ciated with a substantially increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.33


As mentioned earlier, ephedrine should not be taken by patients with heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid disease, diabetes, or difficulty in urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland. Nor should ephedrine be used in patients on antihypertensive or antide- pressant drugs. Ephedrine will potentiate other stimulant/sympatho- mimetic drugs and will likely counteract antihypertensives.

1. Ephedra was once an extremely popular herbal product. That popularity ended on February 6, 2004, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ban on the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra. This ban was finalized on April 6, 2004. The FDA made this decision based on increased reports of adverse events. Dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids, like other sympathomimetics, raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. The FDA believed ephedrine-based products exposed users to several risks, including the consequences of a sustained increase in blood pressure (e.g., serious illnesses or injuries including stroke and heart attack that can result in death). There was also a risk of increased morbidity and mortality from worsened heart failure and proarrhythmic effects in susceptible individuals. 2. Chang HM, But PP.

## Analgesic Effect

Ethanolic extracts of E. angustifolium injected subcutaneously had a weak analgesic effect on mice in the hot plate test, whereas its analgesic effect was greater than that of acetylsalicylate in the acetic acid test.17 In mice, an extract of E. hirsutum had an analgesic effect comparable to morphine and diclofenac.18

## Antidiarrheal Effect

Ethanolic extracts of fireweed showed significant antidiarrheal and antimotility effects in a variety of animal models.19

## Anti-Inflammatory Effect

Aqueous extracts of E. angustifolium (40 mg/kg orally) strongly reduced the release of prostaglandins and depressed edema in vivo.20 Its effect on edema was equivalent to indomethacin (2 mg/kg). E. parviflorum did not suppress edema and had about 20% of the effect on prostaglandin release. Isolated myricetin-3-0- β -d-glucuronide was 10 times more effective than indomethacin at inhibiting edema in rats, was equally effective at inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis, and had a dose-related antiarthritic effect.21,22 It inhibited both cyclooxygen- ase-1 and -2 nearly equivalently and inhibited 5-lipooxygenase com- parably to nordihydroguaiaretic acid. It dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation equivalently to indomethacin, but in contrast to indomethacin, it induced no gastric ulcers. The compound may be safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, because it prevents the arachidonic shunting that results in the formation of leukotrienes.

## Antimicrobial Effect

Dilute extracts of fireweed are antimicrobial in vitro.23 E. angustifo- lium and E. rosmarinifolium have the broadest spectrum of action, inhibiting bacteria, yeast, and fungi. E. angustifolium and E. hirsutum inhibited Microsporum canis at concentrations as low as 10 mcg/mL. In another study, E. angustifolium failed to inhibit Aspergillus niger but somewhat inhibited Candida albicans while strongly inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.24

## Antitumor Effect

Oenothein B, isolated from fireweed, showed some antitumor activity against sarcoma 180 in mice and some selectivity against lung cancer cells and two colon cancer lines, but did not have a noticeable effect on the prostate cancer lines tested.25 In other studies, E. angustifolium had a specific and significant antiproliferative effect on human pros- tate epithelial cells.26 In addition, several of its flavonoids were potent growth inhibitors when tested on various hormone-sensitive and hor- mone-nonsensitive cell lines.

## Effect on Prostate and Prostatic Enzymes

Extracts of various fireweed species inhibited aromatase in vitro.27 This action was primarily attributed to oenothein A and B, but other fire- weed flavonoids also inhibited aromatase. Both oenothein A and B had a considerably greater inhibitory action on 5- α -reductase in vitro than the reference drug finasteride. The aqueous extract and ultra- filtrate of E. angustifolium had an antiandrogenic effect in intact rats, and the aqueous extract had a proandrogenic effect in castrated rats.28 In another study, alcoholic extracts of fireweed failed to inhibit 5- α - reductase, whereas the aqueous extract showed significant inhibition.29 This action was attributed to the compound oenothein B. Although data on the bioavailability of oenothein B are lacking, it appears that aqueous extracts of E. hirsutum are metabolized by gut microbes to dibenzopy- ran-6-one or urolithins. 30 Urolithins are bioavailable and have been shown to accumulate in mice prostate glands and inhibit cell proliferation


One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 57 healthy males diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) found that a combination product, ProstateEZE Max, significantly reduced day- time and nighttime urinary frequency and reduced the international prostate specific score (36% reduction vs. 8% in placebo group). ProstateEZE Max combines Curcurbita pepo (pumpkin) seed, E. parvi- florum, lycopene, Prunus africanum (pygeum) bark, and Serenoa repens (saw palmetto) fruit. 32 However, no clinical studies were found spe- cifically looking at any fireweed species by themselves. This is unfortu- nate, given preliminary studies indicated that fireweed might be more effective than drugs such as finasteride and indomethacin, as discussed earlier. The existing pharmacological research supports fireweed’s well-established use in traditional medicine as a treatment for prostate disorders and as a topical medicine in various skin conditions.33


Dosages for fireweed are not well established. Fireweed is traditionally administered as a standard infusion using 2 to 3 teaspoons of herb to 1 cup of boiling water, taken as needed.34 The suggested dose for an aqueous/alcoholic tincture is 2 to 6 mL three times a day. Aqueous/alcoholic tinctures appear to be more effective than tinctures with a high alcohol concentration.35,36 No widely accepted standardization exists to ensure quality fireweed extracts, although flavonoid profiles can be used to distinguish the various species.37,38

## 583CHAPTER 78 Epilobium Species (Fireweed)

Species grown in Africa appear to have a significantly higher content of oenothein B than the same species grown in Europe.39


Fireweed has no known toxic effects, and its lack of toxicity is under- scored by a worldwide use as both food and fodder. The median lethal dose for injected ethanol extract in mice is 1.4 g/kg.40


There are no documented drug interactions with fireweed. However, oral doses of E. angustifolium slightly increased the expression of CYP2D2 in rats and significantly decreased expression of CYP3A1 in one study; another found intraperitoneal delivery of an extract of E. hirsutum decreased CYP2E1 and CYP1A1, indicating a potential risk of interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes.41,42

cardiovascular disease, cancers, and systemic inflammation.12 This led influential health and nutrition agencies, including the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association, to recommend that saturated fatty acid intake be limited to 7% to 10% of daily cal- orie energy consumption or 24 grams.15 Recent advances in nutrition research focused on individual saturated fatty acid structure, metabo- lism, and function. The research highlighted the importance of certain saturated fatty acids in gene expression, through the alteration of mes- senger RNA (mRNA; conveys genetic information from DNA), plus lipid metabolism by altering the production, secretion, and clearance of cholesterol.12 Evidence of the effects of saturated fatty acids on car- diovascular health, insulin resistance, and stroke is still mixed.14,16,20 Therefore careful incorporation of these specific fatty acids in the diet may be potentially beneficial for health.11,14-16

## Unsaturated Fatty Acids

Unsaturated fatty acid carbon chains contain one or more double bonds with a terminal carboxylic group (–COOH), unlike saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds.11 These fatty acids are sub- divided into two groups depending on the number of double bonds. A single double bond is termed monounsaturated, and those with more than one double bond are termed polyunsaturated. The IUPAC name for an 18-carbon fatty acid with a double bond at position 9 is called octadec-9-enoic acid.11,13 In addition to nomenclature systems describing the number of carbon atoms and location of the double bond(s), a “cis-” or “trans-” notation describes the configuration. A cis- notation means hydrogen atoms are on the same side as the carbon double bond, whereas a trans- notation means hydrogen atoms are on the opposite side of the carbon double bonds (Fig. 79.3).11,21 The shape of the trans fatty acid creates a kink in the molecule that determines its fluidity state at room temperature and its molecular stability.11 Lipid number nomenclature for the 18-carbon fatty acid with a single dou- ble bond at position 9 and hydrogen atoms on the same side of the double bond is 18:1cis-9.11 The common name is oleic acid. The com- mon name for an 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid with double bonds at positions 9, 12, and 15 is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).11 The IUPAC name is 9, 12, 15-octadecatrienoic acid, and the lipid number is 18:3cis-9,12,15.13

## Monounsaturated Fatty Acids

Monounsaturated fatty acids tend to be solid when chilled and are liquid at warmer temperatures. Compared with corresponding satu- rated fatty acids, monounsaturated fats have a lower heat index and oxidative stability, making them less ideal for cooking at high tem- peratures.17 In descending order, the most common monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet are oleic acid (18:1 cis-9/omega-9), palmitoleic acid (16:1 cis-7/omega-7), and vaccenic acid (18:1 cis-7/omega-7).21 These fatty acids are found in olive oil, sesame, oil, canola oil, avo- cados, and many nuts and seeds.11,21 The main sources of monoun- saturated fatty acids have the cis-configuration. The most common trans-configuration monounsaturated fatty acid is elaidic acid (18:1 trans-9), found in hydrogenated vegetable oils and naturally in some meats in small amounts.21 The Mediterranean diet, which is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, continues to receive attention because of its association with lower cardiovascular disease risk, improvement in insulin sensitiv- ity, decreased risk for certain cancers, and positive effects on cogni- tion.21–23 Two specific monounsaturated fatty acids consumed in great quantities in the Mediterranean diet are omega-7 and omega-9 fatty acids. Omega-7 fatty acids are found in fish (salmon and anchovy), olive oil, and macadamia oil, and omega-9 fatty acids are found in olive oil, canola oil, and sunflower oil. Because these fatty acids can assist with the regulation of blood sugar and fat metabolism or breakdown, they are receiving positive attention for the management of metabolic disorders (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity). 24–26 Health and nutrition organizations recommend that 20% to 25% of total caloric energy be derived from monounsaturated fatty acids, although debate on dietary amounts continues.12,21 National nutri- tional guidelines emphasize balance—by increasing monounsaturated fatty acid intake at the expense of saturated fatty acids—to gain the greatest health benefits.21,23

## Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Because of the structure of polyunsaturated fatty acids, they tend to be liquids.

## 586SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

polyunsaturated fatty acid depends on the location of the last double bond respective to total carbon atoms.7 Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) lipid number nomenclature 18:3cis-9,12,15 describes an 18-carbon cis-polyunsaturated fat with double bonds at positions 9, 12, and 15.11 The location of the last double bond is carbon 15, which is three car- bons away from the tail of the 18-carbon fatty acid. Therefore this is considered an omega-3 fatty acid. If the last double bond is six carbons from the tail of the fatty acid, it is classified as an omega-6 fatty acid.11 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are unique because the human body can- not synthesize precursors to the omega-3 and omega-6 series of fatty acids (Fig. 79.4).7,11 These precursors are termed essential fatty acids. Therefore they must be consumed from food sources such as nuts and seeds and plant-based oils.7,12,27

## Essential Fatty Acids

The essential precursor to the omega-3 series of fatty acids is 18:3cis- 9,12,15 or ALA, found in green leafy vegetables and various nuts and seeds (walnuts, flaxseed, chai seeds).7,12,27,28 The majority of ALA is used to generate energy. Only a small portion of ALA is converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5cis-5,8,11,14,17 or EPA) and docosahexae- noic acid (22:6cis-4,7,10,13,16,19 or DHA); therefore dietary intake is important.8,27,29 Direct sources of EPA and DHA are marine fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines), enriched foods (milk, yogurt, and margarines), and supplements.27 The essential precursor to the omega-6 series of fatty acids is 18:2cis-9,12 or linoleic acid (LA), found in plant oils (sunflower, saf- flower, grape seed, sesame, and corn oils), cereals, eggs, some grains, and poultry.7,12,30 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are precursors to eico- sanoids, or signaling molecules. Those of the omega-6 series are gen- erally considered proinflammatory. However, certain omega-6 fatty acids—specifically dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (C20:3cis-8,11,14 or DGLA)-derived metabolites—play an essential role in cognition, the reduction of inflammation, the promotion of cardiovascular health, and healthy growth and development.7,8,12,30 Conversely, proinflam- matory arachidonic acid (C20:4cis5,8,11,14 or AA) metabolites are associated with chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.7,30 Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be metabolized into eicosanoids via cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes.7 Eicosanoids are inflammatory mediators and include prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs), and hydroxyeicosa- tetraenoic acids (HETEs).6–8 AA (an omega-6 fatty acid) converts to 2-series prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE2, PGF2, and PGD2) and throm- boxanes (TXA2), plus 4-series leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), contributing to inflammatory conditions like arthritis, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).7,12,30 EPA and DHA (omega-3 fatty acids), plus DGLA (omega-6), convert to the anti-inflammatory eicosanoids ALA (18:3 n-3) ω ω STA (18:4 n-3) EPA (20:5 n-3) DPA (22:5 n-3) DHA (22:6 n-3) LA (18:2 n-6) GLA (18:3 n-6) DH-GLA (20:3 n-6) AA (20:4 n-6) DPA (22:5 n-6) COOH COOH COOH COOH COOH COOH COOH COOH COOH COOH Omega-3 Carbon Omega-6 Carbon A EPA/DHA Synthesis Pathway α-Linolenic Acid 18:3 n-3 (ALA) Stearidonic Acid 18:4 n-3 (STA) Eicosatetaenoic Acid 20:4 n-3 (ETA) Eicosapentaenoic Acid 20:5 n-3 (EPA) Docosapentaenoic Acid 22:5 n-3 (EPA) Docosahexaenoic Acid 22:6 n-3 (DHA) ∆6 desaturase ∆5 desaturase ∆4 desaturase C18 elongase C20 elongase CB

3-series prostaglandins (PGI3, PGE3, PGF3, and PGD3) and throm- boxanes (TXA3), plus 5-series leukotrienes (LTA5, LTB5, LTC5, and LTD5).7,30 Because of the varied actions of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary intake should be based on balance. The current consump- tion of omega-6 to omega-3 is a ratio of 20:1, whereas our Paleolithic ancestors consumed equal amounts (1:1).31 This dietary imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 increases proinflammatory eicosanoids and their associated health risks.7,12 Dietary recommendations suggest a decrease in omega-6 consumption or a balance of 2:1 to 5:1 (omega-6:omega-3) to manage and prevent chronic disease.27,31,32

## Trans Fatty Acids

Trans fatty acids contain hydrogen atoms on the opposite side of the carbon double bond(s).11 This slight change in configuration causes the fatty acid to be solid at room temperature, with a longer shelf-life than other unsaturated fatty acids.11,15 A naturally occurring 18-car- bon trans fatty acid with a single double bond at position 11 is called octadec-11-enoic acid (IUPAC), C18:1trans11 (lipid number), or vac- cenic acid (common name).33 Naturally occurring trans fatty acids are found in predominantly non–grass-fed meat and dairy products.33,34 The industrial partial hydrogenation of liquid plant oils is a common source of synthetic trans fatty acids.15 This process involves the addi- tion of a hydrogen atom to a fatty acid, converting the double bond to a single bond.33 Industrially manufactured, or synthetic, trans fatty acids are found in fried foods, potato chips, baked deserts, margarine, and shortening.33,34 Although both trans fatty acids have a similar struc- ture, industrially produced trans fatty acids have a greater negative effect on health than naturally occurring sources.35 Synthetic trans fatty acids contribute to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes through the inhibition of anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids.35,36 Because of the health effect, current recommendations for the consumption of trans fatty acids are less than 1% of total caloric energy intake.15,33,34

# METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Fatty acids derived from digestion and small intestine absorption or endogenous production are either converted into energy, stored as tri- glycerides, incorporated into cellular membranes, or they give rise to longer fatty acids.1 In contrast to other macronutrients (carbohydrates and proteins), fatty acids yield the greatest energy per gram: 9 kcal/ gram.1 To generate energy, fatty acids enter the mitochondria through a series of transport proteins, enzymatic reactions, and free diffusion. The first step combines the fatty acid with a coenzyme A mole- cule to generate acyl-CoA (fatty acid–CoA).37 This process occurs within the cytosol of a cell. Specific transmembrane proteins are used to transport fatty acids into the cytosol, notably fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) and fatty acid translocase (FAT).37–39 FATPs are a family of six proteins (FATP1–FATP6), which are expressed differently in various tissues (i.e., adipose, skeletal muscle, brain, liver, kidney, lung, enterocyte, and brain).38,40 FAT is expressed in macrophages, fat, muscle, intestine, and liver cells.39,41 In addition to lipid metabolism, FAT is involved in angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and inflammation.41 Coenzyme A derived from pyruvate, a metabolite of glucose metab- olism, enters the cytosol through translocation.1 Once the fatty acid and coenzyme A are in the cytosol of the cell, fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) generates an acyl-CoA molecule37: FattyAcid(cytosol)+CoenzymeA(cytosol) +ATP FACS C n− Acyl-CoA+AMP Next, the acyl-CoA molecule moves from the cytosol into the mitochondria, either by diffusion or through transport by carnitine mitochondria transport proteins.37 The length of the fatty acid chain determines how it enters the mitochondria. Short- and medium-chain fatty acids—shorter than 12 carbons—diffuse through the mitochon- dria membranes. Longer-chained fatty acids require the assistance of carnitine mitochondria transport proteins.37 Once the acyl-CoA molecule is within the mitochondrial matrix, it is shortened through a sequence of enzymatic reactions termed beta-oxidation.37,42 This is a multistep catabolic process. The end products of beta-oxidation are an acetyl group, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and flavin adenine dinucleotide F(ADH 2 )37,42. All of these molecules enter the citric acid cycle (also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle or Krebs cycle) or the electron transport chain to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)37,42: C n- AcylCoA+FAD+NAD++H 2 O+CoAC n-2 Acyl CoA +FADH2+NADH+acetyl CoA+H + →

## Carnitine Mitochondria Transport Proteins and

## Deficiencies

Movement of the acyl-CoA molecule from the cytosol through the outer mitochondrial membrane is catalyzed by carnitine palmito- yltransferase I (CPT1). There are three isoforms of CPT1—CPT1a (liver), CPT1b (muscles), and CPT1c (neurons).43 Initially, the enzyme splits the acyl-CoA into two molecules, acyl and CoA. The acyl group is joined to a carnitine molecule forming acyl-carnitine or palmitoyl-car- nitine. This molecule is then transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane, or the mitochondria matrix, by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT).43 Once the acyl-carnitine or palmitoyl-carnitine molecule is within the matrix, it is converted back into acyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT2).43 This process releases a car- nitine molecule, which is moved back into the cytosol of the cell, using CACT and diffusion, where it can then assist another acyl molecule to enter the mitochondria.43 Once the acyl-CoA molecule is within the mitochondria, it can undergo beta-oxidation to generate ATP: Cytosol: C n –Acyl+CoA+carnitineCn−Acyl-carnitineor palmitoyl-carnitie Mitochondria: C n– Acyl-carnitineorpalmitoyl-carnitine CPT2 C n− Acyl-CoA+carnitine CPT1 Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) is considered the rate-limiting, or slowest, step needed to move acyl-CoA into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. There is a rare genetic polymor- phism for CPT1 that makes it difficult to use longer-chained fatty acids for energy production. It is generally diagnosed in childhood, and the primary symptom is hypoketotic hypoglycemia (low ketone and blood sugar levels).44 Affected individuals are at risk of hepato- megaly, liver dysfunction, and/or elevated serum carnitine, poten- tially causing nervous system damage, liver failure, seizures, coma, and sudden death.44 Some individuals have a genetic polymorphism for CPT2, or the enzyme that assists with the conversion of acyl-carnitine or palmi- toyl-carnitine into acyl-CoA energy production. There are several mutations of the CPT2 gene: the lethal neonatal form is associated with cardiac damage, liver failure, seizures, and death shortly after birth; the severe infantile form is associated with increased risk of liver failure, nervous system damage, coma, and sudden death; and a benign adult form is characterized by rhabdomyolysis.44 Management for CPT1 and CPT2 genetic polymorphisms include frequent feedings or avoiding fasting, avoiding sustained exercise, stress management, maintaining optimal immune health, and a low- fat diet.44

## 588SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Another genetic polymorphism that affects fatty acid and car- nitine movement through the inner mitochondrial membrane is carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency. Metabolic con- sequences include hypokinetic hypoglycemia (low ketone and blood sugar levels), elevated serum ammonia, elevated creatinine kinase and transaminases, dicarboxylic aciduria, and an abnormal acylcarnitine profile (low free carnitine and acylcarnitine species).44 Symptomatic neonates present with a rapidly progressive form of CACT deficiency that is often fatal, whereas presentation later in life is generally milder. Dysfunction or damage can occur to the brain, heart, skeletal mus- cles, and liver, leading to progressive neurological, cardiac, and liver deterioration; coma; and sudden death.44 The therapeutic approach is to avoid periods of fasting and hypoglycemia, restrict long-chain fatty foods, and implement carnitine supplementation as needed. The transport of longer-chained fatty acids across the mitochon- dria membranes for subsequent beta-oxidation is dependent on car- nitine. Carnitine can be synthesized by the body, obtained from the consumption of animal products, or acquired through exogenous supplementation. Endogenous carnitine synthesis occurs in the liver and kidney and, to a lesser extent, the brain. The essential amino acids methionine and lysine are joined to form carnitine with the assistance of several nutrient cofactors: pyridoxal phosphate (B 6 ), niacin (B 3 ), vitamin C, and iron.43 People on strict nonanimal product diets maintain carnitine levels, in part, because of efficient renal tubular resorption. Organic cation/ carnitine transporter 2 (OCTN2) assists with reabsorption and the accumulation of carnitine in the liver, kidney, and muscles.43 A genetic polymorphism of OCTN2 leads to urinary carnitine wasting and decreased accumulation within cells.44 Unlike other carnitine genetic defects, OCTN2 affects plasma carnitine levels.44 This autosomal-re- cessive disorder is aggravated by periods of fasting and low dietary carnitine intake.44 Symptoms range from hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy, experienced in early life, to skeletal or cardiac myopa- thy and cardiac-related sudden death.43,44 Clinical management consists of carnitine monitoring and supplementation, monitoring cardiac and liver function, and avoiding hypoglycemic episodes (i.e., fasting).43,44

## Beta-Oxidation

Georg Franz Knoop is credited with discovering fatty acid beta-oxida- tion in 1904.37,42 His landmark experiment involved feeding specific fatty acid compounds to dogs and analyzing their urine. He noticed that the initial compound fed to the dog was shortened by two carbons when analyzed in urine. He concluded that fatty acid metabolism via beta-oxidation is the successive removal of two carbon fragments.37,42 Other influential scientists confirmed and further developed Knoop’s beta-oxidation theory. They identified genetic polymorphism enzyme deficiencies, clarified the role of carnitine in fatty acid metabolism, purified various beta-oxidation enzymes, and cloned genes responsi- ble for disease-causing mutations.37,42 Beta-oxidation is an important metabolic pathway for liver, heart, and skeletal muscle energy pro- duction.42 During fasting, most tissues, excluding the brain, rely on beta-oxidation to generate energy.42 The brain uses ketones—organic compounds created by the liver from fatty acids—as its energy source.42 As Georg Knoop discovered, beta-oxidation is a cyclic process, cleaving two carbon atoms from the acyl-CoA chain. Beta-oxidation is a series of four reactions, including oxidation, hydration, and cleavage of the acyl-CoA molecule.37,42 Each cycle produces acetyl-CoA, nico- tinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2 ), and water.37 The total energy produced from a fatty acid depends on the carbon length. Each cycle of beta-oxidation has the potential to yield 17 ATP molecules using the products of beta-oxida- tion in the electron transport chain and the citric acid cycle.1

## Oxidation

The initial step of the beta-oxidation cycle introduces a double bond between the second and third carbon (in relation to the ter- minal carboxylic group) of the acyl-CoA molecule. This process is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD), generating 2-trans- enoyl-CoA.37,45,46 Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a cofactor for this reaction. In humans, FAD is made from dietary riboflavin or vitamin B 2 .47 This molecule accepts the two hydrogen molecules released from the acyl-CoA molecule—FADH 2 —which can be used to generate ATP: C n– Acyl‐CoA+FAD ACD 2‐trans‐enoyl‐CoA+FADH 2 There are several variations of ACD, based on the length of the acyl-CoA molecule: short-chain ACD (SACD), medium-chain ACD (MACD), long-chain ACD (LACD), and very long-chain ACD (VLACD).48 Although the enzyme’s active site varies in amino acid sequencing, the mechanism of action is similar. Unfortunately, ACD genetic polymorphisms can result in ACD enzyme deficiencies.49 This autosomal-recessive inborn error of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is commonly diagnosed through newborn screening.50–53 ACD deficiency prevents the body from converting fats into energy through beta-oxidation, which is essential, especially during periods of restricted caloric intake. Mortality and morbidity are highest in undiagnosed individuals.49 Each ACD deficiency manifests slightly differently (see following discussion); however, the management principles are the same: frequent feeding or avoidance of fasting, con- sumption of a low-fat diet, and improving immune health to minimize infections.49–53 Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MACDD) is the most common fatty acid oxidation disorder.49,51 If not identified with newborn screening, symptoms of hypoketotic hypoglycemia (low ketone and blood sugar levels) typically manifest by age 3 or later in adulthood.52 Although variable, individuals can experience episodes of vomiting and lethargy, mainly triggered by fasting or illness.51,52 Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD), if not fatal, typically presents in early childhood by age 5.50,54 Symptoms include developmental delay, seizures, behavioral disorders, and hypo- glycemia.50,54,55 People with SCADD can remain asymptomatic or experience muscle-related weakness and wasting in adulthood. The last two ACD genetic polymorphisms, long-chain and very-long-chain dehydrogenase deficiencies, are rare. As early as days or weeks after birth, infants are lethargic and hypoglycemic, have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, irregular heart rhythms, and respiratory failure, potentially leading to death.53 With late-on- set presentation, symptoms include lethargy, hypoglycemia, an enlarged liver, metabolic acidosis, coma, and respiratory or car- diac arrest.53

## Hydration

The second reaction of the beta-oxidation cycle hydrates 2-trans-enoyl- CoA into 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA. A water molecule adds a hydroxyl group (–OH) to the double bond at C2.37 This process is catalyzed by the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase37,56: 2‐trans‐enoyl‐CoA+H 2 O Enoyl-CoA hydratase 3‐hydroxy‐acyl‐CoA

## Dehydrogenase

The hydroxyl group (–OH) from 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA is dehydroge- nated by NAD+, which removes a hydride ion (H+) from the hydroxyl group on the third carbon.37 In humans, NAD is made from the essen- tial amino acid tryptophan or salvaged from niacin or vitamin B 3 .57

## Thiolase

In the final step of beta-oxidation, ketoacyl-CoA thiolase attaches a CoA group to 3-ketoacyl-CoA, yielding two molecules: an acetyl-CoA and a 2-carbon-shorter acyl-CoA.37 If the initial acyl-CoA molecule is an even-number carbon chain, it reenters the beta-oxidation cycle until two carbon acetyl-CoA mol- ecules are formed as the end product.37,56 The acetyl-CoA molecules are further used to generate energy from the citric acid cycle. Odd- number carbon chain acyl-CoA molecules result in the formation of a three-carbon propionyl-CoA and a two-carbon acetyl-CoA.56 The propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA through the action of propionyl-CoA carboxylase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.56 Both the acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA molecules enter into the citric acid cycle to generate ATP: 3‐keto‐acyl‐CoA+CoAC n–2 Acyl‐CoA +Acetyl-CoA ketoacyl-CoA thiolase

## Peroxisome Beta-Oxidation

If a fatty acid or derivative is unable to be oxidized by mitochondrial enzymes, beta-oxidation can occur in peroxisomes.58 Peroxisomes, a type of organelle, are located within the cytoplasm of cells.59 They contain a variety of enzymes involved in various metabolic reactions, including energy production from certain fatty acids.59 Peroxisome beta-oxidation is reserved for very long-chain fatty acids and long-chain fatty acids.43,58 A CoA molecule is removed from the longer-chained fatty acyl-CoA through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, allowing entry into the peroxisomal membrane.43,60 Similar to mito- chondrial beta-oxidation, peroxisome beta-oxidation consists of oxi- dation, hydration, dehydrogenase, and thiolase enzymes.58,60 However, as the fatty acid chain shortens, it can be exported to the mitochondria for the completion of beta-oxidation.43,60 The primary function of per- oxisome beta-oxidation is chain-shortening, whereas mitochondria beta-oxidation is focused on the generation of energy.37,43

# MODIFICATION AND SYNTHESIS OF FATTY ACIDS

Fatty acids are predominately derived from the diet; however, the body can synthesize fatty acids from acetyl-CoA or change the structure and function of a fatty acid, by either introducing a double bond (desat- uration) or adding carbon atoms (elongation).61,62 Modification or endogenous production of fatty acids leads to functionally diverse fatty acids for energy production, incorporation into cellular membranes, or conversion into eicosanoid signaling molecules.1

## De Novo Lipogenesis

De novo lipogenesis—or endogenous fatty acid synthesis—gives rise to fatty acids within the cytoplasm of cells.62 The precursor, acetyl-CoA, is derived from pyruvate (a carbohydrate metabolite), fatty acid beta-oxidation, citrate from the citric acid cycle, and the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine).1,62 Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a biotin-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the first step, generating malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and requires carbon dioxide and ATP.1,5 There are two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxy- lase (ACC)—ACC1 and ACC2—with expressions in different tissues (adipose, skeletal muscles, and heart); however, both are found in the liver.5 Malonyl-CoA from ACC1 adds 2 carbon atoms to fatty acids, whereas malonyl-CoA from ACC2 is an inhibitor of carnitine palmito- yltransferase I (CPTI)5,63: Acetyl‐CoA+CO 2+ ATPMalonyl‐CoA ACC ACC is regulated by several molecules. Insulin activates carbox- ylase, whereas epinephrine, an end product of de novo lipogenesis (acyl-CoA), and glucagon inactivate carboxylase.1,5,37 Diet can also reg- ulate ACC synthesis. A prolonged high-carbohydrate diet leads to an increase in ACC synthesis, and a prolonged low-calorie diet decreases ACC synthesis.1,5 Malonyl-CoA, generated from acetyl-CoA, extends the length of fatty acids through the addition of two carbons. This process is cata- lyzed by fatty acid synthase (FASN), a multienzyme protein, generating a saturated acyl chain with additional two carbon groups.5,62,64 The pri- mary end product of de novo lipogenesis is palmitate (C16:0 or hexa- decanoic acid), a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid and stearic acid (C18:0 or octadecanoic acid), in smaller quantities.64,65 The endogenous fatty acids are stored as triglycerides, incorporated into cell membranes as phospholipids, converted to ATP, or converted to longer fatty acids.5

## Desaturation

Desaturation is the introduction of a double bond into a fatty acid chain. This process is catalyzed by endoplasmic reticulum mem- brane-bound enzymes: NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and a terminal desaturase.2 Through a complex process of transfer- ring electrons and reduced iron to interact with oxygen, a double bond is formed, releasing two molecules of water. The location of the double bond depends on the type of enzyme. In humans, the name of the enzyme is delta ( Δ ) desaturase, which introduces a double bond, counted from the carboxyl end of the fatty acid.2,8 Three Δ desaturases are found in mammals: Δ -9 desaturase, Δ -6 desaturase, and Δ -5 desaturase.8 Delta-9 desaturase introduces a double bond between carbons 9 and 10, mainly generating monoun- saturated fatty acids.2,3,8 The primary product of this pathway is oleic acid (18:1 cis-9), which is incorporated into triglycerides and used for phospholipid synthesis.2 Delta-5 and Δ -6 desaturase enzymes intro- duce a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 or carbons 6 and 7. These enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs).2 HUFAs function to maintain membrane fluidity, triglyceride syn- thesis, eicosanoid signaling (modulating inflammation and protect- ing the digestive tract epithelium), and gene expression regulation.2,3 Unlike plants and lower eukaryotes, mammals lack the ability to add double bonds beyond carbon number 9, making dietary consump- tion of certain fatty acids metabolically essential.8 Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an 18-carbon fatty acid containing three double bonds at positions 9, 12, and 15.11 The location of the double bonds makes this omega-3 fatty acid essential, meaning it must be supplied through dietary intake. ALA gives rise to other omega-3 series fatty acids: eicos- apentaenoic acid (20:5cis-5,8,11,14,17 or EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6cis-4,7,10,13,16,19 or DHA) using desaturase enzymes.8,11 Linoleic acid (LA) is also an 18- carbon essential fatty acid containing two double bonds at location 9 and 12.11 LA gives rise to other omega-6 series fatty acids: dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (C20:3cis-8,11,14 or DGLA) and arachidonic acid (C20:4cis5,8,11,14 or AA) using desatu- rase enzymes.8,11 There are several conditions that influence delta-desaturase activity: genetic polymorphisms, vitamin and mineral deficien- cies, and insulin resistance. Delta-9 desaturase is encoded by stea- royl-CoA desaturase (SCD), whereas Δ -6 and Δ -5 desaturase are

## 590SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

encoded by fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desatu- rase 2 (FADS2).2,8,30 These enzyme deficiencies lead to a reduction in beneficial fatty acids (i.e., oleic acid and EPA) while perpetuating chronic diseases (inflammation and cardiovascular disease) associ- ated with the presence or deficiency of nonbeneficial fatty acids.8 These enzymes are also influenced by the deficiency in cofactors: magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin B 2 , vitamin B 6 , and vitamin B 9 . Therefore appropriate cofactors will improve the availability of various omega-3 and omega-6 series fatty acids.66 Lastly, insulin enhances Δ -6 and Δ -5 desaturase, increasing eicosanoid produc- tion, which, in turn, enhances insulin’s action.2,66 Insulin resis- tance, therefore, affects these enzymes, leading to a decrease in eicosanoid production and inefficient insulin activity.2,66

## Chain Elongation

Fatty acid elongation occurs within different compartments of cells, mainly the cytosol, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticu- lum or microsomes.4 In the cytosol, the addition of two carbons occurs as a part of de novo lipogenesis, producing palmitate (C16:0 or hexadecanoic acid) as the primary end product.4 Within the mitochondria, acetyl-CoA and fatty acyl-CoA increase the carbon length of fatty acids catalyzed by enoyl-CoA reductase.4 The mic- rosomal fatty acid pathway, the principal pathway for elongation, uses products of de novo lipogenesis and dietary fatty acids to gen- erate longer-chain fatty acids, catalyzed by elongase enzymes (Elovl 1–7).4,30,67 In combination with desaturation, elongation enzymes can gener- ate longer-chained fatty acids from the metabolically essential omega-6 (DGLA and AA) and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA).30,67 AA con- verts to 2-series prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE2, PGF2, and PGD2) and thromboxanes (TXA2), plus 4-series leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), contributing to inflammatory conditions.7,12,30 EPA, DHA, and DGLA convert to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids: 3-series prostaglandins (PGI3, PGE3, PGF3, and PGD3) and throm- boxanes (TXA3)s, plus 5-series leukotrienes (LTA5, LTB5, LTC5, and LTD5).7,12,30

## Saturated Fatty Acids in Health and Disease

Saturated fatty acids are associated with many chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, and systemic inflamma- tion.12 However, certain saturated fatty acids, ranging from 12 to carbons, may play an important role in hormone production, car- diovascular health, gene transcription, lipogenesis, apoptosis, cellular membrane structure, and protein signaling.12,14,16,20

## Dementia and Cognitive Decline

The saturated fatty acid link to dementia, elevated serum low-den- sity lipoproteins (LDLs), and other chronic conditions, was based on an association with elevated serum cholesterol and elevated SFA intake.68 However, a recent scientific trial failed to identify an associ- ation between SFA consumption and an increase in LDL cholesterol, visceral fat, or the incidence of metabolic syndrome, all of which are postulated to contribute to cognitive decline and dementia.21 This trial evaluated the effects of specific SFAs on lipid metabolism and noticed an alteration in the secretion and clearance of cholesterol.12 In descending order, the following SFAs raised total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol: myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid C14:0), lauric acid (dodecanoic acid C12:0), and palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid C16:0), but not stearic acid (octadecanoic acid C18:0) or medium-chain saturated fatty acids. 11,14–16


Because of the link between saturated fatty acids and elevated serum low-density lipoproteins, it was postulated that the dietary intake of saturated fatty acids contributes to cardiovascular disease.69 However, a comparison of two populations with similar intakes of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol—France and Finland—revealed different cardio- vascular mortality rates.70 This study highlights that certain saturated fatty acids (stearic acid and medium-chained saturated fatty acids less than 12 carbons), and balanced consumption with monounsaturated fatty acids, play an important role in cardiovascular health.70,71 Literature focusing on the quality of saturated fatty acids links the intake of stearic acid and medium-chained fatty acids (less than carbons) to increases in larger, more buoyant LDL particles, which present a lower risk for cardiovascular disease compared with smaller, dense LDL particles, despite cholesterol content.72–74 Therefore com- mon cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, are not perpetuated by certain SFAs. Specifically, stearic acid (octadecanoic acid C18:0) and medium-chain saturated fatty acids decrease intestinal cholesterol absorption.11,14–16,75

## Monounsaturated Fats in Health and Disease

The Mediterranean diet is often considered to be a healthy approach because of the dietary focus on monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and their association with lower cardiovascular disease risk, improve- ment in insulin sensitivity, a decreased risk for certain cancers, and positive effects on cognition.21–23 Increasing MUFA intake and decreasing saturated fatty acids is recommended to achieve the greatest health benefits, specifically oleic acid (18:1 cis-9/omega-9), palmitoleic acid (16:1 cis-7/omega-7), and vaccenic acid (18:1 cis-7/omega-7).21

## Cardiovascular Health and Metabolic Syndrome

Monounsaturated fatty acids demonstrate cardio-protective effects by promoting a healthy lipid profile, mediating blood pressure, and improving insulin sensitivity and glucose levels.21,23,76 When MUFAs replace dietary saturated fatty acid intake, improvements in cardiovas- cular lipid profiles are noted, namely, lowering the ratio of total cho- lesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.21,23 In addition, when MUFAs replace dietary carbohydrates and specific saturated fatty acids (myristic acid, lauric acid, and palmitic acid), hypotensive effects, a reduction in heart rate, and improvement in insulin and gly- cemic control are noted.21,23 Additionally, dietary MUFAs lead to a decrease in central adiposity, a reduction in visceral fat accumulation, and enhanced beta-cell function.22,23,77

## Polyunsaturated Fats in Health and Disease

Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) are metabolically essen- tial polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from dietary consumption or sup- plementation. ALA gives rise to EPA and DHA, whereas LA gives rise to DGLA and AA, after the combined efforts of desaturation and elonga- tion enzymes.8,11 EPA, DHA, and DGLA convert to anti- inflammatory eicosanoids—3-series prostaglandins (PGI3, PGE3, PGF3, and PGD3) and thromboxanes (TXA3), plus 5-series leukotrienes (LTA5, LTB5, LTC5, and LTD5)—which have been shown to decrease signaling pro- teins involved in inflammation, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α ), and interleukin 6 (IL-6).7,12,30 Arachidonic acid contributes to inflammatory conditions through conversion to 2-series prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE2, PGF2, and PGD2) and thromboxanes (TXA2), plus 4-series leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4).7,12,30 Because of the varied actions of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary intake guidelines focus on balance: favoring anti-inflammatory PUFAs (EPA, DHA, and DGLA) compared with the inflammatory PUFA (AA) because inflammation is considered a contributing factor, or a mediator, for many chronic conditions.7,12,31

## Mood and Cognition

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are present in all cellular mem- branes. Arachidonic acid and DHA are the PUFAs found in high con- centrations within the brain.78–80 Altered PUFA concentrations in the brain, resulting from dietary deficits in omega-3 and an abundance of omega-6 fatty acids, are thought to play a role in the pathophysiol- ogy of mood and cognition. Within brain membranes, PUFAs regulate neurotransmission, inflammation and oxidation, and neuroplasti- city.81 The unsaturated nature of omega-3 fatty acids encourages an increase in membrane fluidity that is necessary for proper function- ing of cell membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors. A change in the omega-3 concentration in the brain has been shown to lead to an increase in serotonin receptors (5-HT 2 ) and a decrease in dopamine receptors (D 2 ).81,82 This leads to altered neurotransmitter metabolism, release, and uptake.82 Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and interleukin-6) alter serotonin metabolism and contribute to oxidative damage.82 Anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids counteract these cytokines, whereas AA contributes to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, inducing oxida- tive damage.81–84 An increase in oxidative stress also leads to neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative diseases.9 Lastly, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to improve neuroplasticity through their incorporation into membranes and the generation of neurons.80,81 Therefore alterations in the balance of AA and omega-3 contribute to mood and cognition. In fact, decreasing the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in mood disorders.80–84

## Cardiovascular

Atherosclerosis is characterized by inflammation-derived eicosanoid production from arachidonic acid (AA). Thromboxane-A2 and leu- kotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) induce vasoconstriction, whereas thromboxane-A2 and leukotriene-B4 activate platelet aggregation and induce free radicals.7,85,86 Furthermore, these eicosanoids stimulate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF- α ), which con- tribute to obesity development and poor insulin sensitivity, which are associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease), high blood pressure, peripheral artery dis- ease, and stroke.31,87,88 The American Heart Association recommends that adults maintain a low ratio of AA to omega-3 fatty acids by con- suming fatty fish a minimum of twice per week or 1 gram of EPA and DHA daily.89


Three-series PG (PGI3, PGE3, PGF3, and PGD3), derived from EPA, DHA, and DGLA, can inhibit the growth of cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis; this is beneficial in proliferative diseases, like cancer.90 Cancer cells evade apoptosis through several proposed mechanisms: modulation of eicosanoids, influencing gene expression, generation of intracellular oxidative stress, and affect- ing cellular signaling.10 A balance of inflammatory-promoting fatty acids, AA, and anti-inflammatory omega-3 plus DGLA may affect cancer-cell–specific apoptosis and enhance conventional medical therapies.10,91

## Inflammatory Conditions

Omega-3 fatty acids and DGLA give rise to anti-inflammatory eico- sanoids (3-series prostaglandins (PGI3, PGE3, PGF3, and PGD3) and thromboxanes (TXA3), plus 5-series leukotrienes (LTA5, LTB5, LTC5, and LTD5).17,22 Omega-6 AA contributes to inflammation through conversion to 2-series prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE2, PGF2, and PGD2) and thromboxanes (TXA2), plus 4-series leukotrienes (LTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4).7,12,15,30 Production of proin- flammatory eicosanoids (AA) leads to an increase in inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-2, IL-1, and TNF-alpha) production.7 This con- tributes to inflammation, which is considered a contributing factor, or mediator, for several chronic conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, osteoporosis/osteopenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autoimmune conditions, and psoriasis.7,27,92–97 Therefore anti-inflammatory fatty acid support can assist in the reduction of disease severity by decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production.

## Trans Fatty Acids in Health and Disease

Increased intake of trans fatty acids, specifically those that are synthetic or industrially produced (in foods that contain partially hydrogenated oil, such as packaged snacks, fried foods, and margarine), coincides with adverse cardiovascular lipid profiles, increased inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction.35 Trans fatty acids inhibit the Δ -6-desaturase enzyme needed to convert metabolically essential fatty acids into lon- ger-chained anti-inflammatory fatty acids (EPA, DHA, and DGLA).7 Because these anti-inflammatory fatty acids are also incorporated into phospholipids, trans fatty acid consumption negatively affects cell-membrane composition.


Trans fatty acid intake corresponds to adverse cardiovascular lipid profile markers, including an elevation in the low-density lipopro- tein (LDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–cholesterol ratio, an increase in triglycerides, an increase in lipoprotein (a), a reduction in LDL particle size, and an increase in LDL particle number.35,36,98 Trans fatty acids are associated with the proinflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and C-reactive protein (CRP).35,36,99 These inflammatory substances potentiate atherosclerotic changes, and negatively affect measures of vascular endothelial function.35 Their contribution to an increase in adipose tissue promotes further inflammatory changes and increased cardiovascular risk.35

## Liver Dysfunction

An increase in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, along with oxidative damage, can contribute to the pathophysiology of liver dysfunction.100 EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (3-series prostaglandins [PGI3, PGE3, PGF3 and PGD3] and thromboxanes [TXA3], plus 5-series leukotrienes [LTA5, LTB5, LTC5, and LTD5]), reducing lipid accumulation (fat deposits) and attenuating oxida- tive damage through up regulation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2), an anti-oxidant regulating protein protective against oxidative dam- age.7,30,101 Additional evidence suggests that functional liver changes (increasing cholesterol accumulation, cholesterol secretion, and lipo- proteins), systemic inflammation, and visceral fat accumulation can also contribute to insulin resistance.102,103

<!-- chunk -->

## Mood and Cognition

Increased trans fatty acids, and the resulting decrease in omega-3 fatty acids, can lead to an increase in aggression, irritability, and poor word-recall performance.104,105 The proposed mechanism of action is the inhibition of Δ -6 desaturase.105 Because omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into brain cellular membranes, decreased production can negatively affect neurotransmission, inflammation and oxida- tion, neuroplasticity, and, thereby, mood and cognition.81,82,106 These same mechanisms are postulated to contribute to cognitive disorders, including dementia.107

# CONCLUSION

The basic structure of a fatty acid is a hydrogen-carbon chain with a terminal carboxylic group. Fatty acids are grouped into two main cat- egories, saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids, based on the presence or absence of double bonds.11 The number of carbon atoms plus the location of a double bond is the basis for the nomenclature system of fatty acids. A common system is the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) system, which uses a Latin numerical system to describe the number of carbon atoms plus the location of double bonds.13 Although very descriptive, this system can be cumbersome, leading many to use simplified common names.11 Fatty acids derived from digestion and small intestine absorption or endogenous production are either converted into energy, stored as triglycerides, incorporated into cellular membranes, or they give rise to longer fatty acids.1 They yield the greatest energy per gram, compared with other macronutrients, through mitochondria or peroxisome beta-oxidation.1,37,42 In addition, the body is able to generate fatty acids using acetyl-CoA (de novo lipogenesis) and modify existing fatty acids by adding a double bond (desaturase) or increasing the carbon-chain length (elongation).2,4,5 The process of elongation and desaturation gives rise to important omega-3 fatty acids—EPA and DHA—from essential alpha-linolenic acid. Omega-6 fatty acids—DGLA and AA— are formed from linoleic acid.30,67 The effect of fatty acids on health depends on their structure and quantity, plus the balance in relationship to other fatty acids. The struc- ture, quantity, and balance of fatty acids help ensure proper fluidity and membrane permeability of cells, balance of eicosanoid production, and free-radical generation.2–10 An impermeable and stiff cellular membrane, inflammation, and oxidative damage are underlying processes that are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of mood and cognition, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions, obesity, and cancer.11,12 Therefore the strategic incorporation of fatty acids, through dietary intake or supplementation, can positively influence health. Examples of condi- tions that may be helped by a proper balance of fatty acids, along with rec- ommendations for achieving a better balance, can be found in Table 79.1.

DHA and EPA of up to 2000 mg/day. The FDA’s decision to permit such a claim is significant and timely, in that by 2000, 1 million Americans were reported to have heart attacks annually. Based on these and several other studies, it is now estimated that this one change in diet could save at least 150,000 people annually from fatal heart attacks.12–17 Of course, increased daily intake of 5 to 7 servings of fruits, vegetables, and nuts rich in antioxidants will also reduce the incidence of heart attacks. In 2002 the American Heart Association (AHA) released a position paper advocating the consumption of oily fish twice per week among those without heart disease and at least 1 g/day of EPA/DHA among those with established coronary artery disease (CAD).18 This marks the first time the AHA recommended a nutritional supplement for CAD prevention. Although most clearly established for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, the benefit of dietary fish oil and fish oil sup- plements extends much more broadly to other conditions, including autoimmune, inflammatory, neurological, gastrointestinal, and respira- tory conditions. For example, the EPA and DHA found in fish oil were shown in various studies to reduce the pain of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), menstrual cramps by decreasing inflammation, the risk of premature delivery in pregnancy, and low birth weights. Beneficial effects were also reported in the treatment or management of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, mild to moderate depression, Raynaud disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), immunoglobulin-A (IgA) nephropathy, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel disease, kidney stones, cystic fibrosis, psoriasis, and cancer. Additionally, DHA was shown to be important for neurogenesis of neuronal synapses and healthy eye development of fetuses and infants. Perhaps most importantly, fish oil has the potential to improve overall physiological function and well-being, not because it targets one specific abnormality but because it reduces systemic inflam- mation and supports optimal cellular function.

# DESCRIPTION

Marine life is generally rich in two ω -3 fatty acids (also referred to as n-3 fatty acids), EPA and DHA, which enter the food chain through phy- toplankton. These long-chained and highly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) contain, respectively, 20 and 22 carbons and 5 and 6 double bonds, also referred to as 20:5n-3 PUFA and 22:6n-3 PUFA (Fig. 80.1). The 20:5n-3 PUFAs and 22:6n-3 PUFAs are abundant in shellfish, sea mammals, and fish, hence the reason Greenland Eskimos’ diet is rich in EPA and DHA. By comparison, EPA and DHA levels are low or absent in domesticated land animals, in part because mammals lack the enzymes needed to insert a double bond in the n-6 or n-3 position. Thus, linoleic acid and α -linolenic acid (ALA), rich in several plant oils, are essential fatty acids and, slowly and with significant genetic variation, are enzy- matically converted to EPA and DHA. Fish oil from herring, cod liver, wild salmon, mackerel, and sardines is particularly rich in ω -3 fatty acids containing EPA and DHA. Table 80.119 lists the relative concentration of fatty acids in various common fish species.

## Wild-Caught Versus Farmed Fish

The habitat in which fish grow has a major effect on their fatty acid composition.20 In the wild, fish consume food sources that contain high levels of ALA (18:3n-3). Fish raised in “fish farms” deserve men- tion. It has been reported that salmon raised in fish farms receive a steady diet of synthetic pigment to give them a rich pink hue; oth- erwise, they would be unappetizing given their rather morbid, pale- gray appearance. In the natural ocean environment, phytoplankton, which are rich in EPA and DHA, form the basis of the food chain for salmon and contribute to its pink color. Commercial fish foods con- tain less DHA and EPA and therefore lower concentrations of ω -3 fatty acids. Studies showed that wild fish have higher concentrations of ω -3 fatty acids than pond-reared and/or cultured fish grown in fish farms and fed commercial feedstuffs that are devoid of EPA and DHA.21 Additionally, although wild fish are also increasingly contaminated, farmed fish often contain higher levels of toxins, such as organochlo- rines, brominated flame retardants, and methylmercury, particularly when they are also given fish meal as a food source.22,23 Of particular concern, farmed fish typically have substantial contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other persistent organic pollut- ants (POPs). Research has shown that this contamination is from their feed, as well demonstrated in Fig. 80.2. ω3 PUFAsω6 PUFAs O HO O Diet HO O HO O HO O HO Alpha-linolenic acid (C 18:3 )Linoleic acid (C 18:2 ) Arachidonic acid (C 20:4 ) Eicosapentaenoic acid (C 20:5 ) Docosahexaenoic acid (C 22:6 ) Inefficient metabolism by desaturase and elongase Metabolism by desaturase and elongase in body ω3ωω6ω ω6ω ω3ω ω3ω Fig. 80.1 Structures of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

Although fish oil is associated with a reduction in insulin resis- tance, fish intake is now associated with an increased risk of diabe- tes.24 Mice fed either a very high-fat diet or a Western diet, both of which included farmed salmon fillets, developed insulin resistance and obesity, and these negative effects were shown to be, in part, mediated by the presence of POPs in fatty fish.25 Fig. 80.3 shows a compelling association between PCB exposure and diabetes incidence.

## Other Sources of Omega-3 Oils

For individuals who do not or cannot consume seafood, foods such as tofu, canola oil, black currant oil, flaxseed oil (the best nonfish source), nuts, and soybeans are important sources of ALA (18:3n- 3). However, soy-derived oils and foods and most nuts contain large amounts of ω -6 fatty acids that can reduce some of the therapeutic benefits of the ω -3 fatty acids, so finding a prudent balance between ω -3 and ω -6 fatty acids is suggested. Additionally, one analysis indi- cated that a dramatic 1000-fold increase in the consumption of soybean oil over the past century increased ALA intake, but it was offset by the increase in linoleic acid and therefore likely to depress tissue levels of EPA and DHA.26 A review found that the fatty acids found in fish oil, particularly DHA, are substantially lower in tissues of vegetarians and vegans, including plasma levels, breast milk, and blood cells.27 Fortunately, organically derived supplemental DHA and EPA from algae is now available for those wishing to avoid fish consumption.28

## Dietary Requirement

The first suspected case of ω -3 fatty acid deficiency in humans was not reported until 1988, and the optimal intake of ω -3 fatty acids, both plant and marine based, is still not well established.29 No Adequate Intakes (AIs) or Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) have been set so far by the Institute of Medicine for EPA and DHA or the long-chain ω -6 arachidonic acid (AA), although it has established AIs for the short- chain ω -3 (ALA of 1.1 g for women and 1.6 g for men). There are several factors that complicate the establishment of clear dietary requirements, and several lines of evidence offer some guidance. Evolutionary intakes of ω -3 fatty acids ALA and EPA+DHA estimated by Kuipers et al.30 suggest a probable value of 9 g/day (range 8.7–9.3g) of ALA and 3.9 g/ day (range 0.8–9.7g) of EPA+DHA per 2000 Kcal/day. One of the factors involved is the proportional intake of ω -6 fatty acids to ω -3 fatty acids. It appears that the ratio of these two types of fatty acids, as well as their total intake, is important in determining health out- comes, and a change in both variables has occurred in Western diets over the past 150 years. Currently, the ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids in a typical Western diet is 15 to 20:1, whereas in wild animals, as well as humans throughout most of evolutionary history, it has been approximately 1:1.31 This dramatically shifted ratio has skewed the metabolic products (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, hydroxy fatty acids, and lipoxins) derived from AA (vs. n-3 acids) to favor a more inflammatory, prothrombotic, proaggregratory, provasoconstrictive, and proprolifera- tive physiological state. The n-6:n-3 ratio was found to be important not only to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases but also in cancer, in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and in brain function.32 One example that highlights the importance of the ratio between oils was demonstrated in a study of more than 400 healthy men and 450 healthy women. Researchers found that only at high n-6 intakes were DHA and EPA intakes inversely associated with some markers of inflammation, and a combination of both was associated with the low- est inflammation.33 Similarly, the intake of n-3 fatty acids in women with a high intake of n-6 fatty acids has an inverse relationship with the risk of breast cancer.34 This was confirmed in a very large prospective cohort study of Chinese women (Shanghai Women’s Health Study), in which the relative intake was more important to the risk of breast cancer than total intake.35 In other words, the consequence of low n-3 intake is particularly important given a background of high n-6 intake. Another contributing factor may be variations in the activity of enzymes involved in eicosanoid synthesis. For example, there is some conversion from ALA to EPA and DHA, but this conversion is lim- ited and has significant interindividual variation.36 This conversion from ALA is estimated to be approximately 5% for EPA and less than 0.5% for DHA, and the desaturase enzymes involved are influenced by smoking, gender, age, trans fat intake, and n-6 fatty acid intake. One study found that despite large differences in the intake of n-3 fatty acids between fish eaters and nonfish eaters, the plasma levels were much closer than expected, likely due to increased conversion.37 Also of importance is the individual variability of the activity of enzymes involved in mediating the physiological effects of fish oil. For exam- ple, variants in the 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) gene appear to modify the effects of fish oil on cardiovascular risk, as do polymorphisms in per- oxisome proliferator–activated receptor- α (PPAR- α ).38–40 Despite these limitations, most recommendations suggest a desired DHA and EPA total intake of approximately 0.5 to 1 g/day as preventative therapy, with higher doses indicated for treating specific conditions. A ratio of 2:1 to 1:2 EPA/DHA is often advo- cated, depending on therapeutic goals. For example, the Technical Committee on Dietary Lipids of the International Life Sciences Institute (North America) suggests an intake between 250 and mg DHA+EPA per day for CAD prevention. Currently, even a 500- mg target would require at least a tripling of the current intake in most Western countries.41 Because the concentration of EPA and DHA in fish can vary depending on the growth environment, fish oil supplements can offer a viable and reliable source of ω -3 fatty acids standardized around the content of EPA and DHA (see Table 80.3). Most fish oil capsules con- tain between 300 and 500 mg EPA+DHA fatty acids per gram, whereas some are concentrated to contain as much as 700 mg EPA+DHA per gram. Patients using fish oil at the therapeutic levels discussed herein may require between 15 and 30 capsules daily to derive the described benefits, depending on their DHA+EPA content. At 9 calories/g of oil, this can represent a significant increase in caloric intake and may necessitate an increase in energy expenditure to avoid weight gain. We recommend using fish oil supplements that are highly concentrated to decrease unnecessary calorie intake. EPA- and DHA-rich fish oil should be kept in capsules (e.g., soft gelatin with minimal plasticizer content42; see later discussion under “Oxidation”) capable of providing an oxygen barrier. Otherwise, toxic lipid peroxides (e.g., malondialdehyde) and anisidine isomers may form. Encapsulated liquid sources generally do not have this protec- tion unless they contain antioxidants. Encapsulated products typically contain fish oil, not fish liver oil. This distinction is important because fish liver oil contains the fat-soluble vitamins that, if taken in exces- sive amounts, can cause vitamin A toxicity, although some brands are reducing the vitamin A content during processing.

## Explaining Inconsistent Results of Fish Oil

<!-- chunk -->

## Supplementation Trials

Several articles in the fish oil literature have reported equivocal or contradictory results. Many of these differences in outcomes can be explained by the use of olive oil as a placebo or the lack of control for saturated or ω -6 fatty acid intake, as well as an insufficient dose of n-3 fatty acids. For example, in the Alpha Omega trial, nearly 5000 patients with a previous myocardial infarction were given only 400 mg DHA/ EPA, a dose less than one half that used in previous trials.43 Not sur- prisingly, this low dose did not improve the rate of major cardiovascu- lar events. It also raised plasma levels to a much lower degree than in previous trials that used a higher dosage. Olive oil cannot be considered an inert placebo in trials that inves- tigate effects on platelet function or CHD risk. Several studies showed that olive oil supplementation has similar inhibitory effects on various aspects of platelet function, including decreased platelet aggregation and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) release, increased platelet membrane oleic acid content, and decreased platelet membrane AA content.44,45

## 597CHAPTER 80 Fish Oils and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Further, an excess of oleic acid impairs incorporation of AA into plate- let phospholipids. An additional consideration that is often ignored is the back- ground intake of the enrolled study population. For example, an increase in n-3 intake in Western populations showed a reduc- tion in the risk of sudden death, a benefit not consistently shown in Japanese populations, where the background intake is much higher.46 The lack of a relevant biomarker, such as the ω -3 index (dis- cussed in the following section), and the lack of consideration of an individual’s genetic response are also variables that certainly contribute to the appearance of ineffectiveness. For example, stud- ies that use food frequency questionnaires often do not accurately gauge n-3 intake. Additionally, they do not consider differences in fatty acid metabolism that are vital to determining more func- tional measures. An analysis of more than 700 individuals found that supplements and the intake of EPA-/DHA-rich food explained less than one half of the variability in red blood cell content, which may be due to the individual intake of linoleic and/or arachi- donic acid because they all compete for incorporation in the cell membranes.47 Another possible complicating factor is the squalene found in olive oil and some deep-water fishes but not in other vegetable oils.48 Other problems include the differing ratios of fatty acids, the position of the fatty acids on the glycerol backbone, and the susceptibility to peroxida- tion of the various fish oil preparations.49 Also, overprocessing of fish oil supplements can result in a loss of the fish oil’s active constituents and, hence, an attendant decrease in its efficacy. This was demonstrated in at least two studies that looked at such variables as how processing affects levels of triglycerides, cho- lesterol, lipoprotein(a), atherogenic index, and fibrinogen after fish oil supplementation.50,51


The effects of supplemental and dietary unsaturated fatty acids appear to be mediated through changes in serum lipids, altered ratios of prostaglandins, decreased platelet aggregation, and modification of cell membrane activity.49 Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cause translocation and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) into the cytosol, resulting in vasodilation and improved endo- thelial function.52 Additionally, n-3 fatty acids have been shown to modify gene expression and to directly reduce inflammation by bind- ing to n-3–specific receptors. Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid [DPA]) are also the metabolic precursors to the resolvins, lipoxins, and protectins now shown to be essential to the resolution of inflammation. In 2010 researchers published a breakthrough study in the jour- nal Cell, which for the first time identified a new G-protein–coupled receptor, GPR120, that “functions as an n-3 FA receptor/sensor in proinflammatory macrophages and mature adipocytes.”53 Through this receptor, DHA and EPA mediated robust anti-inflammatory sig- naling, inhibiting both the toll-like receptor and tumor necrosis fac- tor- α (TNF- α ) pathways. This finding was quite important, in part because insulin resistance is modified by these pathways, and because these same researchers were able to document a direct insulin-sensitiz- ing effect by EPA and DHA mediated via this receptor. This provides a direct and specific mechanism for improving insulin sensitivity. Fish oils have also been shown to be the precursors for the mod- ulators of the resolution phase of inflammation.54 Resolvins, derived from EPA, and protectins, derived from DHA, have been shown to be crucial to both the resolution of inflammation and the initiation of tissue repair in multiple body systems. This modulation of inflamma- tion by fish oil has also dramatically changed the way inflammation is viewed. It is now understood to be a carefully orchestrated active pro- cess, dependent on adequate intake of eicosanoid precursors, rather than a passive process. Fish oils also appear to reduce triglycerides and decrease the pro- duction of the prothrombotic substance TXA 2 by occupying TXA 2 receptors and enhancing the production of the platelet antiaggregatory substance prostacyclin. These actions play an important role in inflam- mation, atherogenesis, thrombosis, and CHD. Fish meals that provide an average of 3.6 g/day of ω -3 fatty acids reduce platelet aggregation and platelet TXB 2 responses.55 Significant decreases in platelet sensi- tivity to collagen, serum TXB 2 levels, and urinary TXB 2 metabolites were observed after ω -3 fatty acid treatment.56 EPA supplementation was shown to decrease synthesis of the ω -6 platelet agonist TXA 2 coin- cident with formation of the inactive ω -3 form, TXA 3 .57,58 A longitu- dinal study showed a pronounced action of dietary ω -3 fatty acids to diminish platelet formation and endothelial deposition, which could lead to thrombosis.59 Through the vasodilatory effects of prostaglandin I3 (PGI 3 ), fish oils may improve peripheral circulation, thereby assisting very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol removal. This may be accomplished by altering membrane fluidity in a specific manner, thus affecting the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and resulting in changes in receptor activ- ity, specificity, and signal transduction. The incorporation of fish oil into membranes was shown to have direct clinical consequences. For exam- ple, in a case-control study of more than 300 patients, a higher ω -3 fatty acid content in red blood cell membranes was associated with a 70% risk reduction in cardiac arrest.60 Evidence also suggests that fish oils decrease hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides and reduce secretion of VLDL cholesterol while displacing AA from tissue phospholipids. This results in ω -3 fatty acid levels that inhibit thromboxane synthesis. Researchers noted that fish oil effects are selective. EPA and DHA not only displace AA from phospholipid pools and inhibit cyclooxy- genase, but EPA also becomes a preferred substrate for cyclooxygenase when peroxide tone is high. This results in decreased production of the vasoactive and aggregatory prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) and increased produc- tion of PGI 3 , which has more potent antiaggregatory effects. According to some researchers, increased bleeding time is due to either less TXA 2 or higher prostacyclin I 3 levels,57 although others contend that EPA conversion to PGI 3 is the primary cause.61 Many researchers believe this change is one of the primary factors that decrease the risk of ath- erosclerosis and thrombosis.62–68 These findings may explain some of the epidemiological evidence of decreased CAD and prolonged bleed- ing time seen in some Eskimos and in those Japanese who eat a diet rich in fish.69 Analyses also indicated that increases in bleeding time might have been exaggerated, with data pointing to minimal, if any, effect. Fish oils rich in EPA and DHA were also found to suppress the production of inflammatory mediators found in patients with RA and psoriasis. The anti-inflammatory effect of the ω -3 fatty acids is prob- ably due to reduced production of leukotrienes, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and TNF- α , all principal mediators of inflammation. One study found that the ability of fish oil to decrease TNF- α production was influenced by an inherent TNF- α production and by polymorphisms in the TNF- α and lymphotoxin α genes (also known as TNF- β ).70 In relation to CAD, ingestion of fish oil and its effect on platelets, erythrocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and liver cells are important in explaining its benefits. The increased concentrations of EPA and DHA from the ingestion of fish oil were shown to do the following: • Decrease production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) metabolites • Decrease production of TXA 2 (an active vasoconstrictor and plate- let aggregator)

## 598SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

• Increase prostacyclin PGI3 (an active vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation) • Increase production of leukotriene B5 (a weak inducer of inflam- mation; weak chemotactic agent) • Decrease production of leukotriene B4 (a weak inducer of inflam- mation; inducer of leukocyte adherence and chemotaxis) Fish oil, particularly DHA, was shown to modify mitochondrial membrane composition, improving mitochondrial function. DHA reduced the vulnerability to the opening of the mitochondrial permea- bility transition pore, a pathological feature of heart failure.71,72


No other clinical application for fish oil has been as well studied as car- diovascular disease, including hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Perhaps because n-3 fatty acids inhibit the development and progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the systemic inflammation that underlies so much of cardio- vascular pathology, fish oil has demonstrated benefit for a wide range of applications.73 What has emerged as a potential biomarker for heart disease is the use of the ω -3 index, the sum of EPA and DHA expressed as a percentage of the total fatty acid content of red blood cell mem- branes. It was shown to be inversely associated with the risk for both fatal and nonfatal cardiac events, allowing clinicians to assess individ- ual risk for their patients, and might serve as a tool for monitoring therapeutic efficacy.74,75 In a study of nearly 800 patients, the ω -3 index was associated with a 69% risk reduction in those with the highest compared with lowest levels for acute coronary syndrome, with an inverse linear relationship between risk and DHA/EPA levels. This amounts to a threefold greater risk in those with a low ω -3 index than those with a high index. In this study, “low” levels were defined as less than 4%, whereas “high” levels were more than 8%, suggesting a possible therapeutic target.76 In the Heart and Soul study mentioned previously, those with an ω -3 index above the median had a 27% decreased risk of death compared with those with a baseline ω -3 index below the median, which was unaf- fected by adjustment for both traditional cardiovascular risk factors and inflammatory markers.11 This was a prospective cohort study of nearly 1000 patients with stable CHD. Interestingly, in a study pub- lished in Journal of the American Medical Association in 2010, a subset of patients recruited from the Heart and Soul study was found to have an inverse relationship between the ω -3 index and the rate of telomere shortening over a 5-year period.77 Certainly, one population that warrants increased intake of DHA and EPA is those with an uncommon (6% of the population) genetic variant that predisposes them to rapid atherosclerotic progression. Individuals with two variants of the ALOX5 promoter have a greater risk for atherosclerosis, marked by an increase in carotid intima–media thickness. Increased consumption of n-6 fatty acids exacerbated this condition, whereas a higher intake of n-3 fatty acids blunted this ath- erogenic effect.39

## Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Benefit

The EPA and DHA in fish oil inhibit the development of atheroscle- rosis, which can reduce the risk of multiple permutations of cardio- vascular disease.60 As discussed in the “Pharmacology” section, fish oil acts through diverse physiological mechanisms, related to resolution and inhibition of inflammatory pathways, as well as modulation of cellular membrane fluidity (Fig. 80.4). For example, EPA and DHA were shown to increase cell membrane fluidity, affecting intra- and intercellular signaling and ultimately improving cell function.78,79 EPA and DHA were also shown to stimulate endothelial production of nitric acid, decrease production of inflammatory cytokines and IL-1, and inhibit monocyte migration into atherosclerotic plaques. EPA and DHA also affect gene expression, at least partly via activation of PPARs. In a randomized and double-blinded trial that enrolled more than 100 participants, supplementation with 1800 mg/day of EPA/ DHA was shown to change the expression of more than 1040 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including genes involved in atherogenesis and inflammation, such as nuclear factor- κβ target genes, proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide synthase 3, and genes involved in eicosanoid synthesis.80 Several biologically active compounds derived from EPA/DHA have been elucidated through newly discovered pathways. These are potent mediators of cellular function, with anti-inflammatory actions and actions that promote the resolution of inflammation, and are thus known as “resolution-phase interaction products” or resolvins, as well as maresins.81,82 The anti-inflammatory component of fish oil may at least partly explain its ability to slow the progression of atherosclero- sis, as well as to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques against rupture.83,84 Atherosclerotic plaques have been shown to incorporate EPA, and a higher EPA content was associated with greater plaque stability and a reduced number of foam and T cells.85 Fish oil also demonstrated lipid-lowering effects, likely mediated partly through the inhibition of VLDL and triglyceride synthesis without reducing the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.86,87 The triglyceride-lowering effect appears to be dose dependent, with a greater effect on those with highly elevated tri- glycerides. This benefit is not seen with plant-source oils containing land-based α -linolenic fatty acid–rich polyunsaturated fat sources (e.g., flaxseed oil) or via reduction of intake of animal-source saturated fatty acids.68 In a review of more than 40 studies that examined the use of fish oils for either primary or secondary prevention, fish oils were found to reduce the rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac and sudden death, and perhaps stroke.88 As mentioned previously, the AHA for the first time endorsed a nutritional supplement for cardiovascular disease prevention in 2002, advocating consumption of oily fish twice per week among those without heart disease, at least 1 g/day of EPA/DHA among those with established CAD, and 2 to 4 g EPA/DHA for individuals with hyper- triglyceridemia.18 However, there appears to be substantial variability between dietary intake and the ω -3 index ( ω -3 blood levels), the latter of which was inversely associated with total mortality among individ- uals with CAD.11 Optimal intake might be more appropriately deter- mined using the ω -3 index as a benchmark, with evidence suggesting a target of 8% or higher.89

## Elevated Serum Lipids

The most consistent effect of fish oils on serum lipids is a reduction in total triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol, especially in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. In general, dietary fish oils appear to both reduce undesirable serum-circulating fats and decrease the production of the prothrombotic thromboxanes. In most studies, fish oil supple- mentation causes a significant reduction in VLDL cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, plasma cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. In hypertri- glyceridemic patients, fish oil supplementation typically results in a significant decline in VLDL cholesterol levels because large decreases in triglyceride levels lead to a decrease in VLDLs.67,90–93 Studies also showed that fish oil induced favorable changes in LDL size. It is well established that plasma levels of small, dense LDL choles- terol are associated with plasma triglyceride concentrations, are more atherogenic, and are markers for cardiovascular disease risk.94,95 Data from the Quantification of the Optimal n-6/n-3 ratio in the UK Diet

## 599CHAPTER 80 Fish Oils and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

(OPTILIP) study indicated that DHA and EPA reduced the propor- tion of the small, dense LDL cholesterol, even if no changes were seen in total LDL cholesterol levels.96 Data from JELIS, a large-scale inter- vention trial, found that EPA (1800 mg/day) was particularly effective in patients with the potent combination of risk factors of low HDL cholesterol and elevated triglycerides, reducing the risk of CAD in this group by 53%.97 Some studies did not find decreases of total cholesterol or LDL cho- lesterol after fish oil supplementation.98–101 However, these equivocal studies used olive oil as a placebo, which, as discussed earlier, is a con- founder. Additionally, beneficial changes to subfractions and particle size with DHA supplementation (3 g/day) were cited in one random- ized trial, despite no significant effect on total LDL cholesterol levels.102 Furthermore, an inverse relationship was found between serum EPA levels and oxidized LDL. Oxidized LDL is emerging as an important biomarker of cardiovascular risk and is a very early and critical step in the development of atherosclerosis.103,104 For patients with elevated serum cholesterol (>7.75 mmol/L = mg/dL) or triglycerides (>5.64 mmol/L = 500 mg/dL), there is suffi- cient evidence to consider fish oil supplementation of 5 to 10 g/day if lower dosages (2–4 g/day) are not effective.105 In one study of patients, supplementation with 10 mL/day (9.2 g) of MaxEPA resulted in significant reductions in triglyceride levels, which were maintained over 4 years.106 Continuing reductions were observed in persons remaining in the study for more than 4 years. The authors concluded that for triglycerides to remain depressed, it seems necessary to main- tain a daily intake of 9.2 g MaxEPA (1 g MaxEPA contains 180 mg EPA + 180 mg DHA). Fish oil (4 g/day) was also shown to improve the non-HDL cholesterol–lowering effect when combined with statin medications. Increases in HDL cholesterol, as well as decreases in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, were seen when combined with atorvastatin versus atorvastatin alone.107 Similar results were also documented when used with simvastatin.105

## Hypertension

In one double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, healthy men and women consumed a control oil or fish oil providing 0.7 g or 1.8 g EPA + DHA per day (intakes achievable through diet), in random order, each for 8 weeks to examine the effect of fish oil on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP).108 Findings indicated that in adults with isolated systolic hypertension, daily doses of EPA + DHA as low as 0.7 g showed clinically meaningful BP reductions. A meta-analysis of more than 30 trials (22 double blinded) inves- tigating the effect of fish oils in reducing blood pressure found that higher doses (median dose 3.7 g/day) were associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 2.1 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 1.6 mm Hg, although lower doses (<0.5 g/day) might not have an effect. The BP-lowering effect of fish oil was found to be greater among those aged 45+, as well as among those with hypertension versus nor- motension.109 Another review cited a number of mechanisms for a hypotensive effect of fish oil, including changes in eicosanoids, blood viscosity, hormonal cellular response, and renin secretion, as well as a decreased response to vasopressors,110 although they also concluded the effect was likely to be small at a dose of 2 to 4 g fish oil per day. Epidemiological evidence indicates a hypotensive effect of dietary fish consumption. The largest study is probably the International Study of Macro- and Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP) trial, an international cross-sectional epidemiological study of nearly men and women living in China, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States. Researchers found an inverse relationship between total dietary n-3 fatty acids and systolic and diastolic BP, in both those with -Decrease VLDL from liver -Lower serum TG -Decrease remnant lipoproteins & post- prandial lipemia -Favorable increase of HDL2 & decrease of HDL3 -Decrease arachidonic acid-derived PGs of2- series & LTs of 4-series -Generate PGs of 3-series & LTs of 5-series -Metabolized to ω-3 anti- inflammatory mediators like resolvins & protectins -Improve NO synthesis & endothelial function -Inhibit proliferation & migration of SMCs -Decrease macrophage infiltration & release of MMPs -Improve plaque stability -Inhibit platelet aggregation -Inhibit sodium channels -Increase depolarization threshold -Decrease cytosolic calcium -Stabilize cardiomyocyte membrane -Increase vagal tone -Decrease arrhythmias & sudden cardiac death ↓ Atherosclerosis Cardioprotection ω3 PUFAs Fig. 80.4 Mechanisms of omega-3 fatty acids in cardioprotection.

hypertension and those with normotension, although the effect was considered small.111 Fish oil seems to have hypotensive effects, ranging from limited (dosages of 5 g/day or less) to substantially larger dosages,55,68,112–119 although there is some conflicting evidence.105 It has been proposed that fish oil depresses vascular response to the hormones involved in hypertension.105 Another suggestion is that fish oil acts by increas- ing vasodilatory prostaglandins PGI 1 and PGI 3 and that this increase accounts for observed reductions in blood pressure.105 To test this hypothesis, one study examined the effect of fish oil on BP in men with mild essential hypertension.120 One group received mL of fish oil (3 g of ω -3 fatty acids), a second group received 50 mL (9 g of EPA and 6 g of DHA), a third group received 50 mL of safflower oil (39 g of ω -6 fatty acids), and a fourth group received 50 mL of a mixture of coconut, olive, and safflower oils. The latter group repre- sented the approximate amount and ratio of fatty acids consumed in the average American diet (39% saturated fat, 46% monounsaturated fat, and 15% polyunsaturated fat). The group receiving the highest dose of fish oil (50 mL) had an average reduction of 6.5 mm Hg in sys- tolic pressure and 4.4 mm Hg in diastolic pressure. None of the other groups, including the low fish oil–supplemented group, demonstrated BP reductions in the aggregate. The study did not find the expected association between increased production of PGI 1 and PGI 3 and sus- tained reduction in BP. This suggests that vasodilatory prostaglandins are probably not the primary mediators of BP reduction by fish oil consumption, although they may play a role. Another proposed mechanism is that fish oils may facilitate excre- tion of sodium and fluid by the kidneys. This was supported by an unpublished double-blind, crossover study in which researchers placed healthy, nonhypertensive men and women on a diet supplemented with approximately 1 g/day of PUFAs for 28 days.121 Each participant received capsules with either fish oil or safflower oil. The fish oil dose was similar to the amount consumed in a single daily serving of tuna, lake trout, or salmon. After 2 weeks, the subjects crossed over to the other supplement. The study found an average drop of 2 to 3 mm Hg in both diastolic and systolic BP in those who received fish oil supple- ments. The researchers also found that fish oil increased urine output by approximately 10%, performing much like a low-sodium diet. This resulted in a reduction in fluid volume. Unlike diuretics, the fish oil supplementation did not increase potassium excretion.

## Stroke

In the Health Professional Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort with more than 12 years of follow-up, a significantly lower multivariate rel- ative risk (RR = 0.57) of ischemic stroke was documented for men who ate fish one to three times a month compared with men who consumed fish less than once a month. Interestingly, higher levels of consumption did not further reduce the risk, and no effect was seen on hemorrhagic stroke.122 A reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke by 30% was also shown in the Cardiovascular Health Study. This trial had nearly adults aged 65+ years and found a 30% lower risk of ischemic stroke with a fish intake of five or more times a week and 27% lower risk with a fish intake of one to four times a week, both compared with an intake of less than once a month. In this study, the benefit was limited to tuna or other broiled/baked fish. Consumption of fried fish or fish sandwiches was associated with an increased risk for total and ischemic stroke.123 A study with more than 30,000 participants in the United States examined the risk of stroke as it relates to fish consumption. This study examined possible explanations for the increased stroke risk in the “Stroke Belt and Buckle” in the southeastern United States, a region known for having at least a 50% higher incidence of stroke. The authors of this study concluded that regional and racial differences in fish consumption might help explain this anomaly; that is, those living in the Stroke Belt are less likely to have two or more servings of fish per week.124 An earlier study published in 1995 found that men who ate fish five or more times a week had a 40% lower risk of experiencing a stroke than men who ate fish less than once a week. A similar study in women by researchers at Harvard Medical School found even more impres- sive results for women.125 In this study, 79,839 female nurses between the ages of 34 and 59 years were followed for 14 years, by which time 574 had experienced a stroke; 303 of the strokes were caused by blood clots, whereas another 181 were caused by a ruptured artery, and the remaining 90 were of undetermined origin. It was determined that women who ate fish once a week lowered their risk of a stroke of any kind by 22%. However, women who consumed fish five or more times per week reduced their risk by 52%. The investigators concluded that women whose intake of fish oils was 0.5 g/day or more had a 30% lower risk of a stroke than women whose intake was less than 0.1 g/day. Of interest was the finding that in those women who had a high fish or fish oil consumption, there was no evidence of an increased risk of hem- orrhagic stroke. The researchers concluded that the protective effect of fish oils was due to their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation, lower blood viscosity, suppress formation of leukotrienes, reduce fibrinogen levels, reduce blood pressure, and reduce insulin resistance. Curiously, the beneficial effects were substantially more likely in women who did not take aspirin on a regular basis, although subsequent studies have not shown a relationship with aspirin intake. In a subanalysis of the JELIS trial, a 20% reduction in stroke risk was shown for individuals taking EPA and a statin compared with those only taking a statin, although these results were limited to par- ticipants who had already experienced a stroke (i.e., secondary vs. pri- mary prevention).10 Currently, more direct intervention trials using fish oil for stroke reduction as the primary outcome are lacking.

## Bypass Patients

Some studies demonstrated that fish oil supplementation might help prevent reclosing (restenosis) of the arteries after angioplasty. In one such study, bypass patients were supplemented with 4 g/day of fish oil.126 One year later, those patients who consumed the fish oil sup- plements had an occlusion rate of 27%, whereas control patients had a 33% rate of occlusion, a relative improvement of 23%. Based on a postoperative evaluation 3 weeks after patients had cardiac transplan- tation, it was found that patients who consumed fish oil supplements had normal endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation, which remained abnormal in patients who did not consume fish oil. A much larger and well-conducted study published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery documented a robust protective effect of fish oil after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Of 2100 participants, 44% were given 850 to 882 mg of EPA and DHA as ethyl esters, in the average ratio of EPA/DHA of 1:2. In addition to a lower risk for late mortality (hazard ratio = 0.51–0.55), those consuming fish oil had roughly one half the need for repeat revascularization. Furthermore, they had lower adjusted risk for the composite of death, Q-wave myo- cardial infarction, or cerebrovascular events. Those with poor left ven- tricular function had a quite large 64% reduction in mortality when taking fish oil.127 The authors of this study supported the use of fish oil supplementation for all patients as part of standard medical therapy after CABG.

## Atrial Fibrillation

A link has long been suspected between fish oil consumption and atrial fibrillation based on epidemiological and experimental evidence,

## 601CHAPTER 80 Fish Oils and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

although the benefit is not clearly established. A prospective cohort study (described previously in the “Stroke” section) found a reduction in the risk of stroke with broiled or baked fish, as well as a roughly 30% lower risk of atrial fibrillation for those consuming fish regularly, although not fried fish.128 The association between fish oil intake and reduced fatal CHD and sudden cardiac death also lends strong support for its use in preventing ventricular arrhythmias.129 Additionally, fish oil targets several of the underlying abnormalities found in atrial fibrillation, including: 1. modulation of electrophysiologic and metabolic heterogeneities secondary to atherosclerotic disease; 2. modulation of cardiac myocyte metabolic activity and cardiovascu- lar oxidant stress; 3. direct modulation of ion channel and transporter activity; 4. indirect modulation of ion channel and transporter activity, via modulation of autonomic nervous system activity; and 5. modulation of inflammatory pathways that promote ectopic elec- tric activity and abnormal conduction.130 Also, atrial fibrillation is known to occur more frequently in dam- aged hearts, which may contribute to mitochondrial pathology and insufficient adenosine triphosphate production, an effect possibly modulated by fish oil.131 However, not all epidemiological studies found a protective effect, including the Rotterdam study and the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study, two very large prospective cohort studies.132,133 The Women’s Health Initiative, a large cohort of healthy women, also reported no apparent benefit of increased fish consumption.134 A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials published in the journal Heart also did not find benefit for the prevention of atrial fibrillation. However, this study had important limitations, including significant heterogeneity and methodological flaws in the included trials, and limited statistical power to detect a benefit. Its authors also acknowledged that most of the studies used a dose that might have been too low (3–4 g/day fish oil) to have a clinical benefit.135 A randomized and placebo-controlled study published in Journal of the American Medical Association also found no benefit when giving 8 g of prescription ω -3 fatty acids (1 g prescription ω -3 fatty acids contains 375 mg of DHA and 465 mg of EPA) during the first 7 days and 4 g/day for 24 weeks.136 The optimal dosage and composition of fish oil for the prevention of atrial fibrillation is not well established. One prospective study of more than 2000 men found that blood levels of n-3 fatty acids appeared to be inversely associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation. However, they found that this protective effect was limited to DHA. It is thus difficult to determine the role fish oil has in the incidence and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, given the conflicting evidence published so far. It may be that optimal administration, dosage, and related factors play a role, but given the complexity underlying atrial fibrillation, it may also depend on the specific etiology and the timing. For example, some data suggest that fish oil is more likely to be of ben- efit for ventricular arrhythmias if CAD is also present, whereas those without heart disease were unlikely to benefit.137 Not all atrial fibrillations have the same pathology, with different pathophysiologic mechanisms characterizing distinct clinical presenta- tions. Some authors suggested that n-3 fatty acids might be more likely to be of benefit for preventing the structural remodeling that leads to resistant and/or permanent atrial fibrillation, which is more likely with underlying heart conditions or after myocardial infarction.138 In summary, doses used clinically so far may not be sufficient for benefit, and not all presentations of atrial fibrillation may respond to treatment. Earlier treatment with fish oil is more likely to have an effect, before significant structural remodeling has taken place. Furthermore, given the mechanisms involved with fish oil, a longer time until benefit is seen might be expected, an effect not considered in many trials. For example, in the randomized trial cited previously by Kowey et al.,136 almost half of recurrences occurred within the first 2 weeks of follow-up (of 24 total), suggesting insufficient time for the buildup of tissue levels.

## Myocardial Infarction and Acute Coronary Syndrome

One of the largest trials to document a protective benefit for individ- uals after a myocardial infarction was the GISSI study.139 In this large secondary-prevention trial, 1 g of n-3 fatty acids (containing 850–882 mg EPA/DHA ethyl esters) greatly reduced sudden cardiac death within 4 months of starting therapy and resulted in a reduction in all- cause and cardiovascular-related mortality. The reduction in the inci- dence of sudden cardiac death accounted for about 57% of the total improvement in mortality rates. At the end of the study, 2.7% of the placebo group participants died from sudden cardiac death compared with 2% in the fish oil group. Overall, cardiovascular death (including stroke) at the end of the study was 6.5% in the placebo group versus 5.5% in the fish oil group. There was no statistically significant differ- ence in the incidence of nonfatal heart attacks between the fish oil and placebo groups. The researchers concluded that fish oils exerted their protective effect by preventing fatal ventricular arrhythmias rather than through an improvement in cholesterol profile. They did note a small drop in triglyceride levels of 4.6% in the fish oil group but found no significant differences in LDL and HDL cholesterol between the two groups. They also pointed out that the number of lives per patients that could be saved every year by giving heart attack survivors fish oil exceeded the number of lives per 1000 patients estimated to be saved by treating heart disease patients with high cholesterol levels with pravastatin. This puts fish oil supplements squarely in the cate- gory of a highly effective unpatentable heart drug, although Lovaza, a prescription-only form of fish oil, is now available. Furthermore, a second trial with more than 9000 participants from the GISSI study found that treatment significantly reduced sudden death, with greater benefit in those with left ventricular systolic dys- function (fourfold greater risk reduction), which increases the risk for mortality.140 The JELIS trial, a prospective trial that combined 1800 mg EPA with a statin for hypercholesterolemic patients, found a 51% reduction in risk for myocardial infarction or cardiac death over 5 years. A reduced risk for myocardial infarction was found for those with and without a previous myocardial infarction, although the effect was greater in those with the former. This study was particularly important because they were able to examine adherence to therapy and found a greater effect in those with complete adherence.141,142 These studies indicate that fish oil reduces the risk for myocardial infarction and cardiac death and that some populations receive quite significant benefit. However, some studies did not find benefit for survivors of myo- cardial infarction in terms of reducing the rate of major cardiovascular effects. For example, a double-blinded, randomized trial with nearly 5000 participants reported no benefit with 400 mg/day of EPA+DHA. Participants in this study were also treated aggressively with other antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and lipid-modifying therapies, which greatly reduced their risk for subsequent cardiovascular events, which might have reduced any potential benefit of fish oil therapy. Additionally, this study was criticized for using too low a dose of fish oil for a clinically meaningful effect.43 Similarly, the German OMEGA trial (a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the effect of highly purified ω -3 fatty acids on top of modern guideline-adjusted therapy after myocardial infarction), which also used aggressive therapies and

## 602SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

a fairly low dose of fish oil (460 mg EPA, 380 mg DHA), did not report a therapeutic effect.143 The authors of this study reported limitations, including its low power to detect benefit, given the risk reduction asso- ciated with other therapies. Also, they reported that both groups (those receiving fish oil and those not) significantly increased their dietary fish consumption during the study period. Given the low dose used, it was not clear that those receiving supplements had a significantly higher intake of EPA/DHA than those who did not. Considerable animal-based and experimental evidence shows that dietary fats modulate the electrical stability of the myocardium and that the appropriate fatty acids can reduce the vulnerability to arrhythmia during myocardial ischemia.144–146 Raising the ω -3 fatty acids to higher levels in the myocardium may also prevent postinfarction ventricular fibrillation.147–149 Data in humans with acute myocardial infarction found that 465 mg/day EPA and 375 mg/day DHA improved ultra- sound indexes of endothelial function without affecting serum asym- metrical dimethylarginine levels, suggesting preclinical benefit.150 One early study (DART) evaluated the effect of dietary intervention in 2033 men recovering from myocardial infarction.4 Patients were randomly allocated to receive one of four types of dietary advice: 1. Lowered intake of dietary fat 2. Consumption of at least two portions of fatty fish (200–400 g) a day 3. Supplementation with three capsules (1.5 g) of MaxEPA (1 g Max EPA contains 180 mg EPA + 180 mg DHA) a day 4. Increased dietary fiber intake At the end of 2 years, those in the group consuming fish were found to have increased their EPA intake to four times that of other subjects. This group also experienced significantly lower mortality. The fat and fiber advice groups showed no differences in mortality. Although the rate of recurrence of heart attack was similar in all groups, the fish and fish oil group had a 29% reduction in risk of death compared with the other groups. These findings are in direct conflict with an earlier study showing no such benefits.151 However, it may be significant that the earlier study was conducted over a short period of 6 weeks. Even in patients with no apparent clinical evidence of arterial dis- ease, fish consumption was shown to improve arterial wall function. One study found that in both healthy patients and those with non– insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, those who ate fish showed sig- nificantly better compliance of their left subclavian artery and femoral arteries.152 Fish and fish oil intake were also associated with the risk of angina and acute coronary syndrome. In one case-control study, individuals with acute coronary syndrome were found to have a 20% lower EPA/DHA content in their red blood cell membranes than controls. Those with the highest levels had a nearly 70% lower risk for acute coronary syndrome than those with the lowest levels.76 Another epidemiological study suggested that the benefit of dietary fish consumption might be limited to fatty fish (i.e., not lean fish), with a more apparent benefit in men.153 Long-term fish con- sumption might be particularly protective, providing another rationale for fish oil use in those with increased cardiovascular risk.154 Interestingly, one study of men with acute coronary syndrome found that symptoms of depression increased as blood levels of EPA/ DHA decreased, supporting a possible link between depression and cardiovascular outcomes.155 Given the underlying pathophysiology, this seems quite plausible from a systems biology perspective. A meta-analysis published in the Annals of Medicine in 2009 found an overall 29% and 23% reduction in risk for cardiac death and all- cause mortality, respectively, when using fish or fish oil. In patients with a previous myocardial infarction, the reduction in risk was even greater (57%). Surprisingly, they found an increased risk for sudden cardiac death in patients with angina with higher fish/fish oil intake.156 This increased risk for participants with angina was unexpected because previous studies showed that fish oil supplementation reduced the number of angina attacks and reduced mortality in men recovering from myocardial infarction.4,157 Significant rheologic improvements in patients with stable angina pectoris might occur after daily fish oil supplementation with 2.8 g of EPA and 1.8 g of DHA.158 In a double- blind, placebo-controlled study, fish oil supplementation resulted in increased red blood cell deformability, reduced whole blood viscosity, and prolonged bleeding time compared with olive oil supplementation. The frequency of angina attacks decreased in both groups. However, neither type of oil affected exercise capacity or hemodynamic response to exercise. Finally, as mentioned previously, a comprehensive review of the use of fish oils for either primary or secondary prevention concluded that they reduced the rates of all-cause mortality, cardiac and sudden death, and perhaps stroke.88 Additionally, an analysis of more than 15,000 patients from the JELIS trial published in 2011 in the Journal of Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis found a significant reduction in major coronary events, defined as sudden cardiac death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and angioplasty/stent- ing or coronary artery bypass grafting. Those with higher plasma levels of EPA (participants were supplemented with EPA only, not DHA) had the greatest reduction in risk.159

## Immune Function

Several of the mechanisms by which fish oil modulates immune func- tion have now been clarified, although much remains to be determined, including optimal dosing and the proportions of DHA/EPA necessary for a clinical effect. Additionally, how in vitro or ex vivo changes trans- late into clinical significance has not been well established. In healthy subjects, the effect of EPA and DHA on ex vivo lymphocyte prolifer- ation was reported in at least 14 articles, at 27 different dose levels, ranging from 0.2 to 7 g EPA+DHA per day, whereas the influence on cytokine production by monocytes was evaluated in 24 studies in treatment cohorts.160 It was shown that increasing the EPA/DHA con- tent of immune cells affected a number of immune functions and that DHA and EPA had varying effects. For example, in one double-blinded study of healthy volunteers, a marker of T-lymphocyte activation was inhibited by approximately 5 g/day of DHA, whereas EPA and olive oil had no effect.161 Most studies, however, did not show any effect on lymphocyte activation, although differences were cited between differ- ent age groups and genders. Similarly, although some reports suggested an inhibitory effect on natural killer cell function and/or modulation of cytokine production by lymphocytes, there was considerable incon- sistency among the studies, and no clear relationship exists.160 Per an excellent review published in 2007, the greatest modulation of immune function by fish oil was mediated via alterations in inflam- matory cytokine production by monocytes, including IL-1 β , TNF- α , and IL-6.160 This ties in with an increased awareness of the links between inflammatory and immune function. Even here, however, there are inconsistencies. Not all studies documented an inhibitory effect (although none showed an increase in inflammatory cytokine production), and the expected dose-dependent relationship was not always observed. One very plausible hypothesis for these inconsisten- cies is that highly relevant genetic polymorphisms are often not con- sidered, such as those that affect TNF- α production.162 Decreased production of the proinflammatory mediator PGE 2 , as well as the incorporation of EPA and DHA into human inflamma- tory cells, does appear to follow a dose-dependent relationship, along with an inverse relationship between EPA and TNF- α and IL-1 β in most studies. One study suggested that at supplementation levels of 1.65 g EPA+DHA per day, no effect was seen, and a threshold existed between 1.65 and 3.3 g EPA+DHA per day.163 Data also suggest that

## 603CHAPTER 80 Fish Oils and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

older individuals, as well as those with specific inflammatory con- ditions, might experience a greater therapeutic effect of fish oil than young, healthy individuals. Some research also suggests that a higher n-6:n-3 ratio has an inhibitory effect on phagocytic function, suggesting a higher intake of n-3 fatty acids might improve this activity.164 This was confirmed in one trial of healthy volunteers given 3 g/day fish oil (26% EPA and 54% DHA), which found an increase in phagocytic activity of 62% and 145% in neutrophils and monocytes, respectively.165 Data has described resolvin D1 (derived from DHA) recognition sites on phagocytes (G-protein–coupled receptors), which mediate its actions, leading to enhanced phagocyte and clearance functions, as well as the resolution of acute inflammation.166 Research published in 2009 in Nature also pointed to critical immune roles for other resolvins related to microbial sepsis and immune vigilance.167

## Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases

Fish oils may play a role in the treatment of autoimmune disease (e.g., SLE, dermatomyositis, autoimmune nephritis, multiple sclero- sis, celiac disease)168–171 and inflammatory disorders (e.g., RA,172 pso- riasis,173 atopic dermatitis1). This may be in part due to the chronic inflammation that often plays a role in the development and perpetu- ation of these conditions. For example, DHA may directly inhibit the release of AA in intestinal epithelial cells when stimulated by gliadin.174 Furthermore, fish oils may help improve the comorbidities that often accompany autoimmune disease, such as the premature incidence and acceleration of atherosclerosis associated with SLE. Clinical tri- als in humans demonstrated a benefit not only for disease activity but also for improving markers of cardiovascular function. In one trial, patients with SLE taking 3 g MaxEPA (1g Max EPA contains 180 mg EPA + 180 mg DHA) had a significant reduction in disease activity (measured by Systemic Lupus Activity Measure [SLAM-R]175). In a second randomized and double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, par- ticipants given Omacor (1.8 g EPA and 1.2 g DHA per day) showed significant improvement in two markers of disease activity (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group and SLAM-R). Additionally, markers of endothelial function and oxidative stress improved after therapy.176 Importantly, this study used olive oil as a placebo, which also showed benefit for several cardiovascular risk factors, yet fish oil provided a statistically significant benefit in comparison.

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is in many ways a representative chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder and may serve as a model for other conditions. The enzyme COX-2 is overexpressed in the synovium of patients, as are products of the enzyme 5-LOX. Interestingly, a study from Spain found decreased levels of ω -3 fatty acids in the blood and synovial fluids of male and female RA patients compared with healthy controls.177 Epidemiological evidence suggested that RA might be linked to n-3 fatty acid intake. For example, it is rare among Eskimos, yet by comparison, 2% of the world’s population is affected. Studies of the Japanese population confirmed an inverse relationship between high dietary fish consumption and a low incidence of RA.178 Further support comes from a population-based, case-controlled study in women that found a decreased risk of RA in those who consumed the most fish.172 A number of reviews concluded that fish oil supplementation was associated with a number of benefits; it reduced pain, the number of tender joints, the duration of morning stiffness, and the use of nonste- roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with RA and was associated with improved physical performance.179 A meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials published in 2007 in the journal Pain supported these conclusions, although the authors concluded that it might take several months of therapy for an effect.180 This slow build- ing effect might also explain the results of an earlier study that found that the anti-inflammatory effect of the fish oils continued for up to weeks after cessation of supplementation. The reduction in the use of NSAIDs is no small benefit. Growing concern about the adverse effects and safety of long-term NSAID use makes any therapy that reduces their necessity quite attractive. For example, in an extremely large meta-analysis published in 2011, every single NSAID evaluated, including ibuprofen and celecoxib, was asso- ciated with an increased risk for cardiovascular death.181 In one small but well-controlled study, cod liver oil was able to reduce NSAID use more than 30% in 39% of patients versus only 10% of controls.182 Fish oil was also shown to enhance the COX-inhibiting effect of other medications, specifically of paracetamol, offering additive clinical ben- efit.183 Similar benefit for reducing disease activity was also cited for indomethacin.184 Interestingly, in a review of the efficacy of fish oil for RA, research- ers looked at the combination of benefits, including a reduction in symptoms, decreased use of medications, and improvement in comor- bidities, and concluded that an argument for the use of fish oil in RA is strong.185 However, they also concluded that: It is probable that the main barrier to clinician acceptance is the promotion of pharmaceutical use as the dominant treatment modality by the pharmaceutical industry sales force that attends to the “detailing” of doctors. In the absence of an equivalent market- ing effort for fish oil, rheumatologists are not inclined to consider, or even be aware of fish oil as a potential component of routine therapy for RA patients, despite the efficacy for symptom relief, the NSAID sparing and the benefits for cardiovascular health, which is compromised in RA patients due to their disease. Sixty patients with active RA were involved in a prospective, ran- domized trial of a 12-week supplementation with fish oil (group I), fish oil with primrose evening oil (group II), or with no supplementation (group III).186 The Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28 score), number of tender joints, and visual analog scale (VAS) score decreased nota- bly after supplementation in groups I and II (p < 0.001). In plasma phospholipids, the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio declined from 15.47 ± 5.51 to 10.62 ± 5.07 (p = 0.005) and from 18.15 ± 5.04 to 13.50 ± 4.81 (p = 0.005) in groups I and II, respectively. The authors concluded that daily supplementation with n-3 fatty acids alone or in combination with GLA exerted significant clinical benefits and certain changes in disease activity in patients with RA. As discussed earlier, the intake of n-3 fatty acids should probably not be considered in isolation because the ratio to n-6 fatty acid intake is quite significant. This is particularly true for RA. A low-AA diet, often vegan and gluten-free, has been used with considerable success for individuals with RA, possibly by supplying reduced amounts of inflammatory precursors. The beneficial effect of fish oil appears to be amplified by a low-AA diet.187 The authors also cited a time-dependent effect (2 months before improvement) and the EPA/AA ratio as being decisive for clinical effectiveness.

## Psoriasis

Despite its underlying inflammatory process, very little recent research has been conducted for the use of fish oil to benefit individuals with psoriasis. Psoriasis is accompanied by high concentrations of AA in the plaques and profound changes in the metabolism of eicosanoids, leading to an increase in proinflammatory agents. Fish oils presum- ably improve the condition by decreasing the levels of inflammatory leukotriene compounds, especially leukotriene B 4 , a lipoxygenation

product of AA. The EPA in fish oil replaces the AA in phospholipids, leading to the formation of leukotriene B 5 rather than B 4 , resulting in a much weaker inflammatory response.188 This effect was demonstrated in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of patients given fish oil to treat their psoriasis.189 Patients who showed evidence of clini- cal response to fish oil therapy for their psoriasis were shown to have higher levels of leukotriene B 5 than those failing to improve. In a controlled observational study, participants were given 2 cap- sules of Oravex per day (280 mg of EPA, 40 mg of DHA, 50 mg of thyme extract, 50 mg of olive leaf extract, 20 mg of green tea extract, 7.5 mg of zinc, 27.5 mcg of selenium per capsule), for a total of mg EPA and 80 mg DHA. Compared with those treated topically with tacalcitol, those given Oravex and tacalcitol had a significantly greater improvement in several markers of disease severity and quality of life.190 Patients with psoriasis (vulgaris) were successfully treated with a low-fat diet supplemented with fish oil.189 An impressive 77% (23% were nonresponders) of the patients reported either excellent, mod- erate, or mild improvement. It was interesting to note that several patients did not show improvement until at least 4 months after initi- ation of supplementation. Again, this may indicate the importance of allowing adequate time for clinical improvement after initiating fish oil therapy. Etretinate is a powerful drug used to treat skin disorders such as psoriasis. It can cause serious adverse effects, however, when used in the regularly prescribed dose of about 1 mg/kg per day. One study showed that a combination of EPA and etretinate at a lower dose (0.3– 0.5 mg/kg per day) worked as well as the pure, high dose and had sig- nificantly fewer side effects.191 Forty-five percent of the patients in the combination group showed excellent improvement (more than 75%) compared with 15% in the pure etretinate group. The time to achieve a 50% improvement in symptoms was also considerably shorter in the combination group (5.1 weeks) than in the monotherapy group (7.6 weeks). Adverse reactions such as inflammation of the lips, dry mouth and eyes, and scaling were observed in both groups but were mild and tolerable. The researchers concluded that the combination regimen was effective in the treatment of psoriasis without marked adverse reactions. Another study investigated whether topical application of fish oil to skin areas affected by psoriasis would alleviate symptoms. The clinical trial involved 25 patients with psoriasis who were randomly assigned to apply either fish oil or liquid paraffin to their psoriatic plaques and leave them covered for 6 hours overnight under an occlusive dress- ing.192 The treatment was repeated daily for a 4-week period. Fish oil proved highly effective in reducing scaling (severity of scaling went from an average rating of 2.91 to 0.32 on a scale from 0–4), plaque thickness (from a rating of 2.21 to 0.52), and erythema (from a rating of 2.71 to 0.90). Itching was not relieved by the fish oil treatment. The 4-week liquid paraffin treatment was also effective in reducing ery- thema but was significantly inferior to the fish oil treatment in reduc- ing scaling and had no significant effect on itching or plaque thickness. Both treatments were well accepted by the patients, and the research- ers concluded that they were both clinically effective, with the fish oil treatment being superior to the paraffin treatment.

## Asthma

Elevated intakes of n-6 fatty acids combined with low intakes of n-3 fatty acids may play a causative role in increasing asthma incidence. A recent review cited five epidemiological studies that all found a pro- tective effect of maternal n-3 fatty acid consumption for asthma and atopic diseases. Intake during infancy and childhood was not as con- sistently shown to be beneficial, but the majority found a protective benefit.193 The authors suggested that early life programming might help regulate immune system function. For example, children of mothers receiving fish oil during pregnancy had a nearly 40% lower risk of asthma in the 16 years after their birth compared with mothers receiving olive oil.194 However, a long-term study found that dietary fatty acid modification, as implemented in a study from birth to age years, did not reduce the prevalence of asthma, atopy, or other atopic disorders at age 8 years. However, the dose used in this study con- tained less than 200 mg n-3 fatty acids, along with a nearly identi- cal amount of saturated fatty acids, per capsule. Compliance was also poorly monitored.195 The effectiveness of fish oil for treating established asthma is contro- versial. In one study, a small number of participants with exercise-induced asthma were given 3.2 g EPA and 2.0 g DHA per day and shown to have equal benefit when given the 5-LOX inhibitor montelukast.196 However, not all trials documented benefit, although the parameters of some stud- ies seem designed to better evaluate drug-type interventions than nutri- tional ones. For example, a controlled trial comparing placebo with n-3 supplementation reported no benefit on lung function or asthma con- trol.197 This study was only a 2-week study, and considering that the delay before benefit in other inflammatory conditions, such as RA, may be 2 to 3 months, it is worth bearing in mind the slower onset of action expected of fish oil therapy. Many of the clinical trials that did not find benefit were less than 2 months’ duration.198 Lastly, a study documented increased asthma severity with a polymorphism of the ALOX5 promoter. Given that individuals with genetic variants in this promoter have been found to have an increase in cardiovascular disease risk that is mitigated by a diet high in n-3, future studies seem warranted to assess the potential benefit in asth- matic patients with or without this genetic predisposition.199 A note of caution: aspirin-intolerant asthmatics may have a wors- ening of symptoms, associated with the inhibition of COX by EPA.


Fish and fish oil demonstrated multiple beneficial roles related to cancer, specifically both its prevention and as an adjunct to cancer treatment. They were associated with a reduced risk of several can- cers, and both might improve the efficacy of other interventions, as well as reduce adverse effects associated with cancer therapy. In some studies, fish oil was also shown to increase survival times. Although specific mechanisms vary from various cancer sites, the ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids might also be an important feature for cancer develop- ment. For example, AA was shown to be elevated in a variety of cancer cell types, whereas DHA and EPA were both depressed.200–202 The role of resolvins and other eicosanoid mediators might include regulating inflammatory precursors to some cancers, such as colorectal cancer.203

## Cancer Prevention

Most epidemiological studies showed some benefit of n-3 con- sumption on either cancer incidence or cancer-related mortality. A meta-analysis of fish consumption and prostate cancer risk found that although there was no association between the risk of develop- ing prostate cancer and fish consumption, there was a 63% reduction in prostate cancer–specific mortality.204,205 A very important case- control study of 466 men found that not only did those with the high- est n-3 consumption have a 63% lower risk for aggressive prostate cancer compared with those with the lowest n-3 consumption, but a genetic polymorphism in the COX gene (SNP rs4648310) strongly modified this risk. Those with the polymorphism and a low n-3 intake had 5.5-fold increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer, a risk that was reversed with a high n-3 intake.206

## 605CHAPTER 80 Fish Oils and Omega-3 Fatty Acids

A large epidemiological study of 23 dietary factors in countries with high and low risks of cancer found a strong association between the percentage of calories from fat and the risk of breast cancer.207 Fish consumption was found to have the next most significant association, a negative correlation. As mentioned previously, for breast cancer, the ratio of n-3:n-6 fatty acids might be particularly important, as demon- strated by two large trials. One trial, which enrolled more than 70,000 women, found that those with high intake of n-6 combined with a low intake of n-3 fatty acid had more than two times the risk of developing breast cancer.34,35 A previous study of 4052 postmenopausal women found that not only was the type of dietary fat associated with breast cancer but also that this risk might be modified by the activity of the enzyme δ -9- desaturase. These women were followed for an average of 5.5 years, and those with DHA concentrations in the highest tertile had less than half the risk of breast cancer than did women in the lowest tertile. PUFAs overall were also protective, with ω -3 acids being somewhat more protective than ω -6 acids. Saturated fatty acid concentrations were not significantly related to breast cancer risk. A higher concen- tration of monounsaturated fats, especially oleic acid, was associated with a significantly increased risk. The researchers pointed out that most oleic acid in mammalian tissue is derived from saturated stearic acid through a process involving the enzyme δ -9-desaturase. Saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, carbohydrates, insulin, testosterone, and estro- gen all activate this enzyme, whereas dietary PUFAs and fasting deac- tivate it. The researchers concluded that the δ -9-desaturase enzyme might be an important link between breast cancer risk and dietary fat consumption.208 A meta-analysis that examined 19 prospective cohort studies found a 12% decrease in the relative risk of colorectal cancer comparing high fish consumption with low fish consumption.209 The largest study (nearly 500,000 men and women) contributing to this meta-analysis was the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study, which found a 31% lower risk of colorectal cancer comparing highest with lowest fish intake.210 An intervention trial using 2 g/day of EPA compared with placebo was shown to reduce the number and size of polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis, further strengthening the evidence for its effectiveness.211 This builds on a previous study in which 34 men and 26 women who had just undergone surgery to remove benign polyps from their colon were followed.212 Patients were divided into four groups. Group 1 was supplemented with 1.4 g/day of EPA and 1.1 g/day of DHA, group 2 with 2.7 g of EPA and 2.4 g of DHA, and group 3 with 4.1 g of EPA and 3.6 g of DHA. Group 4 received placebo capsules containing olive oil. Biopsy samples from the lower part of the colon and blood samples were taken and analyzed at the start of the trial and at 30 days. Overall, patients in the fish oil groups experienced a significant decline in the number of abnormal cells in their colon lining compared with the placebo group. Further analysis showed that the reduction in the number of abnormal cells was limited to patients who had a large num- ber of abnormal cells at the beginning of the trial. The researchers also noted a significant increase in EPA and DHA levels and a significant drop in AA levels in the biopsy samples from the fish oil–supplemented patients. A separate 6-month trial involving 15 patients taking 1.4 g/ day of EPA and 1.1 g/day of DHA also showed a significant drop in the number of abnormal colon-lining cells. The researchers concluded that low-dose supplementation with fish oils inhibited the proliferation of those abnormal cells associated as precursors to polyps in patients at risk for colon cancer and that this effect could be maintained with long-term treatment. Similar to several other studies concerned with oxidation of fish oil in vivo, the authors cautioned that it might be advisable to increase vitamin E intake during fish oil administration. A British investigation of the association between high dietary fat intake and the risk of developing breast and colon cancer revealed interesting findings concerning the incidence of cancer. The study com- pared cancer mortality rates in 24 European countries, Canada, and the United States with fish consumption and the intake of animal fats.213 In countries where the animal fat intake was high, the researchers found a clear inverse correlation between the ratio of fish fat to animal fat and the risk of developing breast cancer in women and colon cancer in both men and women. A similar correlation was found between cancer risk and the ratio of fish fat to total fat intake. This led the investigators to conclude that fish and fish oils not only protect against colon cancer in men but also against colon and breast cancer in women. This pro- tective effect, however, is only apparent in countries where the intake of animal fats is high. In other words, a high intake of fish or fish oils counteracts the detrimental effects of high animal fat consumption. The researchers further concluded that a 15% decrease in animal fat intake combined with a threefold increase in fish oil intake could possi- bly reduce male colon cancer risk by as much as 30% in countries with a high animal fat intake. A threefold increase in fish oil intake could be achieved by eating fish three times a week or by taking two standard fish oil daily supplements containing EPA and DHA. A prospective cohort study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2006 also found a protective effect of fish con- sumption on renal cancer. For women consistently reporting high con- sumption of fatty fish (once per week or more), a risk reduction of as high as 74% was observed compared with women reporting no fish consumption. Lean fish consumption did not reduce the risk of more than 60,000 women in this 15-year study.214

## Cachexia and Treatment Efficacy

Some studies showed that fish oil supplementation, especially at higher doses, might help with weight stabilization in participants with cancer. For example, one early study found that supplementation with approx- imately 2.2 g of EPA and 1.4 g of DHA assisted stabilization of weight in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer. Researchers not only documented weight gain and improved appetite, but these patients also survived an average of 8 months, compared with the expected survival time of 4.1 months typically reported for patients given che- motherapy.215 In another study, 18 patients with inoperable pancre- atic cancer, including 9 patients with Stage 4 tumors, were started on a dose of 2 g of fish oils (containing 360 mg/day of EPA and 240 mg/ day of DHA).216 The dose was subsequently increased by 2 g/day every week until the patients’ body tolerance was reached, with an average final intake of 12 g/day. Before entering the trial, the mean weight loss among the patients was 2.9 kilos per month. After 3 months of fish oil supplementation, an average weight gain of 0.3 kilos a month was observed. Overall, 11 patients (61%) gained weight, 3 became weight stable, and 4 continued to lose weight, but at a significantly reduced rate. The concentration of EPA in plasma phospholipids increased from 0% to 5.3% of total fatty acids after 1 month of supplementa- tion, whereas the concentration of DHA increased to 6.6% from a base level of 3.5%. The researchers concluded that fish oil supplementation arrested weight loss in cancer patients with cachexia. A study published in the journal Cancer found a very significant benefit when supplementing patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at a dose of 2.2 g/day of EPA. These patients also received chemotherapy and were compared with a group receiving standard of care only (i.e., chemotherapy without fish oil). Despite having a mean weight loss of 6.3% over the previous 6 months before chemotherapy, patients receiving EPA maintained weight, muscle mass, and adipose tissue throughout approximately 10 weeks of chemotherapy. Those who received standard of care only lost on average 2.3 kg over the same

period. This study also might have been the first to monitor body com- position directly using computed tomographic imaging. They found that gains were made in muscle and adipose tissue, an important dis- tinction from the accelerated weight gains sometimes observed in lean tissues (liver and spleen) in terminal stages. Additionally, those with the greatest increases in plasma levels of EPA had the greatest gains in muscle mass, suggesting again that a biomarker may be worth incorpo- rating into fish oil therapy. Although this was a very small study, these gains were potentially quite significant, especially given the low dose of fish oil used.217 These same researchers also published a trial that enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC, and although the study was also small, it sug- gested a significant benefit of fish oil therapy. Patients received 2.2 g/ day of EPA and 240 to 500 mg/day of DHA, along with standard-of-care chemotherapy, and were compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In this trial, fish oil supplementation appeared to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy, without increasing its toxicity. The authors reported an approximately twofold increase in response rates and clinical benefit compared with standard of care alone. Additionally, a greater portion of patients who received fish oil were still alive at the time of reporting than the control group, suggesting a likely increase in survival.218 Other studies also reported benefits for treating patients with NSCLC with fish oil.219 Similar improvements in survival time were also seen in ear- lier studies of patients with other end-stage cancers with generalized malignancies. In one study, 60 patients with generalized solid tumors were divided into two groups: one group received 18 g of fish oil con- taining 170 mg of EPA and 115 mg of DHA per capsule, whereas the other received a placebo.220 The fish oil group also received 200 mg of vitamin E daily to reduce oxidation in vivo from the effect of so much fish oil. Each group included 15 well-nourished and 15 malnourished patients. None of the well-nourished patients had cancer cachexia (abnormally low weight and general weakness). The researchers mea- sured the levels of T cells, natural killer cells, and the synthesis of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF before the start of the supplementation and on day 40 of the trial. The study followed all patients until they died. Malnourished patients were found to have a considerably impaired immune function and a decreased production of TNF; both parameters were restored through fish oil supplementation. Malnourished patients overall had a much shorter survival time than well-nourished patients (mean of 213 vs. 481 days). Both malnourished and well-nourished patients who received fish oil and vitamin E survived significantly longer than did patients on placebo. The researchers speculated that fish oils exert their beneficial effect by decreasing the body’s production of PGE 2 , which is believed to play an important role in the initiation and progression of cancer. They concluded that supplementation with dietary ω -3 poly- unsaturated fatty acids, specifically fish oils with an antioxidant such as vitamin E, might offer significant palliative support to cancer patients with end-stage metastatic disease. Potential mechanisms for benefit were outlined in several reviews, including one published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer that called for major clinical trials to be conducted using fish oil as adjunc- tive therapy. The authors reviewed previous research and concluded that long-chain PUFAs not only had cytotoxic anticancer effects by themselves but also modulated the effectiveness of particular che- motherapeutic agents.221 For example, DHA was shown in vitro to have synergistic toxicity with taxanes toward cancer cells and down- regulated Her-2/neu oncogene expression, an effect confirmed in an animal model of breast cancer.222,223 Other mechanisms included modulation of eicosanoid production, modulation of gene expres- sion and of transcription factor activity (e.g., nuclear factor- κ B), and alteration of membrane-associated signal transduction, to name just a few.224 Interestingly, one study even suggested that fish oil might offer benefit for both breast cancer as well as cardiac arrhythmias through a similar mechanism, the regulation of a sodium channel, NaV1.5, although this has not yet been proven.225 Lastly, one review cited both a cytotoxic effect of cancer cells and a protective effect toward healthy cells by the downstream products of DHA (protectins), allowing them to work “as both a sword and a shield.”226 Despite considerable evidence for a beneficial effect of fish oil in the prevention and treatment of various cancers, not all research showed a positive effect. Although some studies might have been too short- term or used too low of a dose for a clinical effect,227 others found benefit for only a subset of patients, even at higher doses.228 Many older studies used fish oil with a very low concentration of DHA/EPA, requiring an intolerable number of pills, a limitation recent advances in available products might remedy. Also, the use of biomarkers, such as the ω -3 index, and genetic polymorphisms might help identify those most likely to benefit, as well as those who need higher dose supple- mentation. For example, a Phase II trial of DHA (1.8 g/day) given to patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy found that those who incorporated it the most (into plasma and/or red blood cells) delayed time to tumor progression and had longer overall sur- vival compared with those who incorporated it the least.229

## Migraine Headache

A role for inflammation in migraine was established for at least some migraineurs, yet surprisingly few studies have been conducted with fish oil for its prevention (benefit for an acute migraine seems unlikely). Two placebo-controlled studies were performed, both find- ing no benefit compared with placebo, yet methodological flaws are found in both. In both studies, olive oil was used as a placebo, and a high placebo effect was observed.230,231 Well-designed clinical trials are early in the research process. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that ω -3 intake had no effect on the frequency and sever- ity of migraine but had a reduction effect of approximately 3.4 hours on the duration of migraine attacks.232 Anecdotal reports indicate that patients with migraine headaches who were given 1 g/day of MaxEPA (1 g MaxEPA contains 180 mg EPA + 180 mg DHA), particularly males, had significantly less frequent episodes, less intense episodes, or both. These results might be due to changes in prostaglandin synthe- sis or reduction, or both, in platelet serotonin release, with a resultant reduction in cerebral vasospasm.


The relationship between fish consumption and diabetes incidence and treatment is not as simple as previously believed. As mentioned previously, a G-protein–coupled receptor was identified that mod- ulates many of the physiological effects of DHA/EPA, including an increase in insulin sensitivity, and most epidemiological evidence sug- gests either no effect or a reduced incidence of diabetes among popula- tions with higher fish intake.233 For example, the incidence of diabetes is low in Greenland Eskimos.234 However, recent studies suggest that greater intake of fish might pose a risk for diabetes. One of the largest was a prospective study of more than 35,000 women (Women’s Health Study), which found a linear increase in the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with fish intake and particularly high risk for those consuming the highest portions (two or more servings of fish per day). This increase in risk with increas- ing n-3 fatty acid intake from fish was not observed with n-3 fatty acids from plant sources, which provides ALA.235 This increase in risk with fish intake was also observed in three other prospective cohorts of both men and women in the United States (152,700 women and 42,504 men), with a 22% increase in risk in those consuming fish more than five times per week compared with those consuming it less than

once per month.236 In a large prospective trial in China (the Singapore Chinese Health Study), no association between n-3 fatty acid intake from fish was seen, although ALA from plant sources reduced the risk of diabetes.237 As discussed previously, contamination of the fish and fish oils with diabetes-inducing persistent and nonpersistent organic pollutants likely accounts for this discrepancy, especially in highly pol- luted China. In one large prospective study of older adults, researchers measured the plasma phospholipid levels of EPA/DHA as well as ALA and exam- ined the risk for diabetes. They speculated that many of the previous trials that found an increased risk for diabetes were prone to error, such as the error associated with food frequency questionnaires. Using a more objective biomarker, they found that phospholipid levels of EPA+DHA along with ALA were not associated with an increased risk of diabetes, and instead, those individuals with the highest concen- trations of EPA+DHA or ALA had a lower risk of diabetes.238 Earlier studies that used biomarkers in younger populations also found no increase in risk.239,240 Although further studies may help clarify the relationship, it is worth noting two additional points. One, as noted earlier, is that fish are becoming contaminated with compounds such as POPs, which have been associated with a surprisingly large increase in the risk for diabetes. Some studies showed fish consumption to be an important predictor for POPs serum levels.241–243 The second consideration is the favorable effect of fish oil on car- diovascular parameters, an important cause of morbidity and mortal- ity among diabetics. In individuals with T2D, fish oil ingestion was demonstrated to favorably alter arterial wall compliance without adversely affecting cholesterol levels, blood pressure, or fasting blood sugar levels, thereby contributing to a reduced risk of the vascular complications seen in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mel- litus and non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.244,245 One study even showed a desirable significant decrease in VLDL triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations in T2D patients consuming three fish oil capsules a day containing 320 mg EPA and 530 mg DHA.246 In another study, 2 g of fish oil per day given to the offspring of individuals with diabetes for 12 weeks was associated with reduced inflammation and markers of endothelial function. Thus, in those at an increased risk for diabetes, fish oil might have an important cardiovascular and metabolic benefit.247 Interestingly, increased fish oil consumption might also reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes in those with increased susceptibility.248 A randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was con- ducted to determine the effect of fish oil administration on gene expression related to insulin action, blood lipids, and inflammation in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).249 Participants with GDM (n = 40), aged 18 to 40 years, were randomized to take either 1000 mg fish oil capsules, containing 180 mg eicosapentae- noic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid (n = 20), or placebo (n = 20) twice a day for 6 weeks. Overall, compared with placebo, fish oil supplementation for 6 weeks in women with GDM significantly improved gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated recep- tor gamma (PPAR- γ ), IL-1, and TNF- α but not gene expression of IL-8. Interestingly, these benefits were observed with relatively low doses of n-3 fatty acids. Although fish oil has not always been shown to improve markers of diabetes and glucose control among those with T2D, its cardiovascular benefit warrants consideration for use in all patients with diabetes.88,250

## Neurodegenerative Disease

Several lines of evidence point to a protective role for EPA and DHA for neurodegenerative diseases. DHA specifically is the predominant n-3 fatty acid in the brain and appears to play a key role in structures involved in the formation of new memories. Additionally, DHA is the precursor for neuroprotectin 1, an important neuronal modulator of function, with anti-inflammatory as well as antiapoptic functions. N-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and its downstream metabolites, have been shown to act via several pathways associated with neurological function, including the following251: • Facilitating the interaction of α -secretase with amyloid precursor protein to produce nontoxic fragments and prevent the formation of A β • Shielding the essential recognition sequence and intramembrane cleavage site for γ -secretase • Serving as a local sink for free radicals that reduce the enzymatic augmentation of γ -secretase activity, which can be induced by free radical damage to the protein complex, which is important for the regulation of normal γ -secretase function • Directly inhibit fibrillation and formation of toxic oligomeric spe- cies of A β Observational data also implied an important protective role of n-3 fatty acids. For example, participants in the Rancho Bernardo study had plasma levels of DHA, as well as dietary fish and dietary DHA levels, evaluated. Each of these variables was associated with the subsequent risk of developing either dementia or Alzheimer’s dis- ease. Having the highest levels of plasma DHA reduced the odds of all-cause dementia by 65% and Alzheimer’s disease by 60%. Dietary DHA had similar benefits, and although fish consumption followed this trend, it was not a statistically significant association.252 A study published in 2007 that enrolled more than 8000 participants found a quite important association. Overall, fruits and vegetables, as well as weekly consumption of fish, was associated with a reduced risk for dementia. However, although the protective effects of fruit and veg- etable intake applied to all participants, fish consumption was only associated with those who did not carry the apolipoprotein-E ε -4 allele (APOE- ε 4 allele). Similarly, excess n-6 consumption increased the risk of dementia more than twofold, but it was modified by two factors. It increased risk only if not compensated by high n-3 intake, and only among APOE- ε 4 noncarriers. Thus the relationship between n-3 con- sumption was not only modified by other dietary factors, such as n-6 consumption, but also by genetic variables.253 A similar association was found in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study, which found that fatty fish, but not lean fish, was associated with reduced risk for dementia, but again, only in noncarriers of the APOE- ε 4 allele.254 A double-blind, randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that n-3 PUFA supplementation (480 mg DHA and 720 mg EPA per day) is associated with improved cognitive function compared with control group with placebo (olive oil) in patients with mild cognitive impairment.255 In addition, several studies have reported that the effect of n-PUFAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease may be through an increase in the clearance of amyloid- β peptide, neurotrophic and neu- roprotective factors, and anti-inflammatory effects.256 Regarding the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, efficacy also appears to be modulated by genetic predisposition. In an analysis of n-3 fatty acid erythrocyte membrane content and cognitive variation in a birth cohort study of cognitively normal volunteers, cognitive ben- efits were associated with higher erythrocyte n-3 content, but again, this was only significant in ApoE- ε 4 noncarriers.257 Not all studies have shown benefit, perhaps because the optimal dose and composition have not yet been clearly established. For exam- ple, as evidenced in trials for major depression, although DHA is the predominant n-3 fatty acid in the brain, EPA appears to have a greater clinical effect. This may be why a controlled trial published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2010 that supplemented participants with 2 g/day of DHA (no EPA) did not find any evidence of benefit. This study also did not report APOE status.258

## 608SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

The first large-scale, well-designed trial was published in 2006 and used 1.7 g DHA and 0.6 g EPA per day or placebo among participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease, all of whom were also taking a cholinesterase inhibitor. Although no difference in primary outcome was observed, a subgroup with mild disease demonstrated a significant reduction in decline compared with placebo. Although APOE status was reported, the treatment effects per APOE status were not. Importantly, only 31% of those in the treatment group were non– APOE- ε 4 carriers. This study suggests those most likely to benefit are at earlier stages of disease.259 Overall, the bulk of the data suggest that those with earlier disease are more likely to benefit, but this benefit is mediated by APOE sta- tus (and perhaps other genetic polymorphisms) and perhaps by n-6 fatty acid intake. The optimal dosage and DHA/EPA composition are not known, but DHA by itself may not be effective. N-3 fatty acids from fish also appear to have a protective effect on other neurodegen- erative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, likely through similar mechanisms.260,261


Several epidemiological studies showed a reduced risk for major depression, perinatal depression, and bipolar disorder with diets high in n-3 fatty acids.262,263 Also, a meta-analysis of 14 trials found that lower levels of EPA, DHA, and total n-3 fatty acids levels in plasma and erythrocytes (data were combined) were associated with depres- sion. When these studies restricted their analysis to studies that used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis, the magnitude of differences in EPA/ DHA and total n-3 became larger.264 Regarding trials for the treatment of depression, results have been quite varied, often due to differences in methodology and the type and dose of fish oil used. However, most have shown a beneficial effect. A review of published randomized controlled trials indicated that stud- ies that found positive effects generally included a high ratio of EPA to DHA, and 1 to 2 g/day might be necessary for effect, but higher levels were not associated with greater benefit.265 Also, the earlier the supplementation of DHA/EPA is started during pregnancy, the greater the chance for benefit.266 Despite DHA being a much more prevalent structural component of phospholipids in neuronal cell membranes compared with EPA, it is EPA that has more apparent effectiveness in clinical trials.267 A second meta-analysis of randomized trials over a 40-year period also found a positive effect of n-3 fatty acids on both major depression and bipolar disorder.268 A small but important study also compared a fairly low dose of EPA (1 g/day) with fluoxetine for major depression and found that both were equally effective. Furthermore, when used together, they were more effective than either agent used alone. Given the likely differences in mechanisms of action, this is not surprising, and combination ther- apy should be considered in those not responding to monotherapy.269 A case-control study published in 2010 examined some of the links between cardiovascular disease and depression, which are known to have a high comorbidity rate. Among individuals with major depres- sive disorder, several cardiovascular risk factors indicated heightened risk, including a low ω -3 index.270 This biomarker might provide a useful tool for determining the efficacy of n-3 fatty acid therapy for depression as well as cardiovascular disease. Lastly, little attempt has been made to examine the role of genetic polymorphisms regarding the interaction between n-3 fatty acids and depression. This may be a promising area of investigation. A published study found that patients with chronic hepatitis C were more likely to experience depression when given interferon- α if they had polymor- phisms in the COX-2 gene or the phospholipase-A2 gene. Both of these genes are involved in eicosanoid metabolism and may modulate the influence of n-3 fatty acid therapy.271

## Raynaud Disease

Preliminary evidence indicated that symptoms of Raynaud disease improved in primary but not secondary Raynaud phenomenon, based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving patients.272 Patients were given either 12 1-g fish oil capsules daily for 12 weeks containing 4 g of EPA and 2.6 g of DHA, or a placebo. The group receiving the fish oil supplements reported significant allevia- tion of symptoms associated with Raynaud disease at the end of the study, including 5 patients who developed symptoms before the exper- iment began but could not induce symptoms at all after either 6 or weeks of supplementation.

## Malaria

Malaria afflicts more than 500 million people worldwide, with about 5% of victims dying each year. Unpublished studies at the U.S. Department of Agricultural Research Service Center in Beltsville, Maryland, found evidence that the ω -3 fatty acids in fish oil may be beneficial in the treatment of malaria.273 In their research, mice were fed dietary fish oils for 4 weeks and then inoculated with parasites, either Plasmodium yoelii or Plasmodium berghei. As the mice contin- ued to eat the diet high in fish oil, the parasites multiplied as usual. However, after 3 to 4 weeks, the mice were free of the parasites. The researchers suspected that the cause of the parasites’ death was rupture of the parasites’ cell membranes or red blood cell hosts. The research- ers theorized that infected cells were more susceptible to rupture because the parasites fostered several destructive oxidative reactions to which a diet high in fish oils makes them more vulnerable. Subsequent studies are lacking, although one animal-based study found that fish oil without vitamin E may improve survival and reduce reinfection.274 Human trials are lacking.

## Renal Disease/Immunoglobulin-A Nephropathy

Fish oil supplementation was shown to be effective for several renal diseases, including IgA nephropathy, the nephrotic syndrome, and a deficit of n-3 fatty acids, which was demonstrated in several studies for those with end-stage renal disease. In a small study of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients, a depletion of reduced n-3 fatty acids and a high ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acids were observed.275 Lower EPA and DHA in the plasma/serum phospholipids of those with chronic kidney disease was also documented, and intravenous n-3 therapy was used to restore normal levels.276,277 Both hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia are common in patients with nephrotic syndrome. This association results in an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fish oils were found to lower serum triglycerides in patients with nephrotic syndrome and might therefore be of clinical benefit.278 Unfortunately, no recent trials have examined this benefit. IgA nephropathy is a kidney disease that can follow a viral infec- tion of the gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract. About 20% to 40% of all IgA nephropathy patients develop renal failure 5 to 25 years after diagnosis. One study at the Mayo Clinic found that fish oil sup- plementation could be effective in slowing down the progression of the disease.272 The progression of the disease was judged by regularly measuring the level of creatinine in blood serum during the 2 years of the trial. A clear difference was observed. The patients in the fish oil group who received 12 fish oil capsules a day, containing 1.9 g of EPA and 1.4 g of DHA, had an average median increase in serum creatinine of only 0.03 mg/dL, whereas the patients in the placebo group experi- enced an increase of 0.14 mg/dL annually, indicating that their disease

was progressing significantly faster. After 4 years, 40% of the patients in the placebo group died or developed end-stage renal disease com- pared with only 10% in the fish oil group. No adverse effects of fish oil supplementation were observed. A recent reanalysis of this data did not find that body size was helpful in predicting optimal dosage.279 An additional study using 1.8 g/day of EPA for 1 year found small but significant benefits, including an improvement in the estimated creatinine clearance.280

## Muscle and Bone

N-3 fatty acids have emerged as being of potential clinical importance for the health of both muscle and bone tissue. In a study of more than 1500 men and women from the Rancho Bernardo Study, a cohort of community-dwelling individuals, a higher n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio (based on food frequency questionnaires) was associated with a lower bone mineral density of the hip in both men and women.281 A second smaller study published in 2007 found that among young men (women were not studied) serum phospholipid levels of n-3 fatty acids, particu- larly DHA, were associated with peak bone mineral density in the total body and spine, and with bone accrual in the spine.282 Intervention data are still lacking, however. In one small trial that enrolled adults with depression, no change in C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen, a bone resorption marker, was seen after 1.45 g EPA/DHA for 12 weeks. However, this study could be criticized for using a low dose over a short period of time and evaluating only marker of bone resorption, and the patient population did not neces- sarily start with increased bone resorption. This was a sample of patients of a wide range of ages with depression, not osteoporosis or other risk factors for bone loss. The authors’ conclusion that n-3 supplementation might not be useful for preventing bone loss may only be appropriate to the population they studied, not more generally, and perhaps not using different doses or markers of bone health.283 A study published in 2007 found just the opposite. Although researchers used plant-based n-3 fatty acids, which might not be equivalent to DHA/EPA, they did find that supplementation with ALA did have a protective effect and inhibited bone resorption. This indicates that in principle, n-3 fatty acids play an important role.284 The effect of fish oil supplementation as an intervention to prevent and/or treat osteoporosis awaits well- designed clinical trials. In a study published in 2008, a retrospective analysis was done of a cohort of nearly 3000 men and women aged 59 to 73 years. When examining multiple dietary influences on grip strength, a potential marker for muscle strength and function, fatty fish consumption emerged as having the greatest effect.285 Although very small, a sec- ond interventional study compared the effects of either corn oil or n-3 fatty acid supplementation on muscle synthesis in older adults; 1.86 g EPA and 1.50 g DHA were shown to increase muscle pro- tein synthesis. Particularly, supplementation augmented the hyper- aminoacidemia–hyperinsulinemia induced synthesis of muscle, suggesting it may be beneficial for the treatment and/or prevention of sarcopenia.286

## Pregnancy and Lactation

Many studies have been published on the effects of DHA and/or fish oil during pregnancy and lactation, with several indicating that mater- nal intake of n-3 fatty acids reduces the chance of premature birth, improves children’s neurological development, and also reduces the risk of maternal depression.262,287,288 No significant adverse effects were cited with intakes of up to 1 g/day DHA or 2.7 g/day long-chain n-3 fatty acids in randomized trials. As mentioned earlier, the sooner supplementation begins during (or before) pregnancy, the greater the chance for benefit, at least regarding maternal depression.266 A study published in Journal of the American Medical Association, however, did not find a reduction in maternal depression or improved cognition and/or language in the children of mothers given 800 mg DHA and 100 mg EPA during pregnancy and challenged existing thought regarding supplementation.289 One possible limitation of this study was the failure to assess the n-3 intake of participants in the study, aside from the provided supplement, although cord blood determinations suggested a low intake in the control group. The median gestational age was 19 weeks in this study. Supplementation earlier or before conception may have had a greater effect. In contrast, a review of interventional and epidemiological studies supported the use of DHA and EPA supplementation for childhood cognition and development, as well as preventing childhood psychiatric disorders.290 Mercury toxicity is also of concern and may accompany increased fish consumption. A study published in 2008 found that although maternal fish consumption was associated with a benefit on children’s cognition at age 3, mercury levels were associated with poorer test scores. This certainly suggests that obtaining fish oil from purified sup- plements or low-mercury fish is preferable and may provide greater benefit than is often cited due to fish consumption (which may be con- taminated with mercury).291 Recommendations to avoid fish (perhaps due to mercury) may be associated with worse outcomes, as suggested by an observational study published in the Lancet in 2007.292 Finally, an article published in 2011 suggested that genetic varia- tion might significantly modulate n-3 fatty acid levels in pregnancy, children, and breast milk composition.293 Here, too, the use of a bio- marker such as the ω -3 index might be of clinical value.

# TOXICITY AND TOXIN CONTAMINATION

Despite widespread use, toxicity with fish oil is quite rare, with the most frequent side effects being mild dyspepsia, nausea, and belching (“fish burps”). Of growing concern, however, is the increasing con- tamination by environmental toxins such as mercury and POPs (e.g., PCBs and organochlorine pesticides). An excellent risk and/or benefit analysis of fish consumption was published that offers a species-spe- cific analysis of ω -3 content as well as mercury contamination of each species.294 The authors of this study suggest that in theory, fish oil sup- plementation from a high-quality source avoids the contamination of consuming fish. Previous studies found the commercial fish oil to be free of mercury, PCBs, and organochlorines, but quality control is essential.295 Additionally, supplements that use fish oil derived from small, cold-water fatty fish are much less likely to be contaminated.296 Care must also be taken to use fish oil, not fish liver oil, because the latter can be excessively high in vitamins A and D and possibly result in toxicity. Finally, large dosages of fish oil supplements may result in a signif- icant increase in total caloric intake, which can be ameliorated by an increase in energy expenditure.

## Bleeding Time

Concerns have been expressed about prolonged bleeding time in pop- ulations having a relatively high intake of fish. Several studies showed that this effect appears to be dose dependent, although collagen- induced platelet aggregation was not shown to be inhibited.297 Many studies showed that fish oil supplements prolong bleeding time, inhibit platelet aggregation, and decrease TXA 2 production.62,112,298–308 However, many of these studies are several decades old. In an edi- torial published in March 2007 in the American Journal of Cardiology, the author concluded that current research was nearly unanimous: “omega-3 fatty acid supplements do not increase the risk for clin- ically significant bleeding, even in patients also being treated with

antiplatelet or antithrombotic medications. Anecdotal reports of an increased bruising tendency have not been tested in a controlled set- ting.” He also considered this to be at the “A” level of evidence (i.e., based on well-designed, randomized controlled clinical trials). One caution was that interactions with newer antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel have not been evaluated.309 A second review in the same issue also concluded that clinical trials showed high-dose fish oil con- sumption to be safe, even when concurrently administered with other agents that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and warfarin. This review also suggested that the reported antiatherothrombotic effects of fish oils might outweigh the unproven bleeding risks, particularly for those patients at high risk for thrombosis.310 Some early research suggested that the effect of fish oil supplemen- tation on bleeding time was largely determined by the dosage, dura- tion, and composition of the supplement, and the typical treatment regimens are safe. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, daily supplementation with 30 mL of a Scandinavian fish oil formulation (ESKIMO-3: 35% n-3 fatty acids, 18% EPA, and 12% DHA) given for both short (4 weeks) and long (6 months) durations resulted in no changes in bleeding time.65 Another controlled study used 1.5, 3, or 6 g of fish oils (SuperEPA) as a supplement for 3 months and found no effect on bleeding time in 45 healthy male volunteers with normal triglycerides.311 In the large Enoxaparin MaxEPA Prevention of Angioplasty Restenosis (EMPAR) trial (of more than 800 patients receiving fish oil and low-molecular-weight heparin), a decrease in bleeding frequency was seen in the fish oil group compared with placebo.312 Evidence as to the degree to which fish oil may affect fibrinoly- sis is conflicting. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis. Increased PAI-1 activity was linked to the development of myocardial infarction and thrombosis by several investigators. In at least one double-blind, randomized study con- ducted on an untreated essential hypertensive population, a modest increase in fibrinogen levels was observed after fish oil and corn oil intake by 4 g of ω -3 PUFAs.313 However, no change in PAI-1 activity or tissue plasminogen activator activity was found. A crossover study found fish oil to have the same effect on PAI-1 activity as olive oil.314 No major bleeding events had been reported in trials as of 2018.

## Oxidation

It was reported in an animal-based study that a diet rich in fish oil taken for many months can induce a deficiency of vitamin E, leading to cardiac necrosis.315,316 For this reason, periodic vitamin E (mixed tocopherols or γ -tocopherol) supplementation may be warranted. However, there is no evidence that the incidence of cardiac necrosis is higher in Eskimos. The ω -3 fatty acids found in fish oil are susceptible to oxidative breakdown. For this reason, they must be protected from oxidation by proper extraction and storage, encapsulation, or stabilization with an antioxidant such as vitamin E. Inappropriately stored fish oils (i.e., exposure to oxygen) may result in the formation of toxic lipid perox- ides over time.

## Fatty Acid Supplements

The consumption of essential fatty acid supplements and vegetable oils is increasing, with fish oil now one of the most frequently consumed nutritional supplements. However, the high concentration of unsat- urated fatty acids in these products makes them more susceptible to spoilage and oxidative damage. Several factors accelerate spoilage of these oils, including the presence of reactive metals, high water con- tent, or high temperatures during processing and storage. Consumers perceive oxidative damage as rancidity or off-flavors and off-odors. The health implications of this damage are important. Oxidative damage diminishes the nutritional value of these oils by destroying vitamins and other nutrients. Oxidative products may also interact with protein and carbohydrates. In addition, the by-products of lipid oxidation may pose a health risk to consumers. Some edible oils are more resistant to oxidative damage. For exam- ple, vegetable oils may naturally contain antioxidants such as tocoph- erols or vitamin E. Antioxidants prevent the oxidative reactives that can lead to rancidity. Many pathways of oxidation of lipids are not completely understood. Two pathways that have received attention are oxidative and hydrolytic rancidity. Oxidative reactions tend to be more complex, and their by-prod- ucts are difficult to measure. Initially, oxygen combines with free fatty acids to form hydroperoxides and free radicals. These reactions are influenced by many factors: the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids present in the oil; processing and storage temperatures; oxygen con- centration; light exposure; presence of antioxidants in the oil; moisture content of the oil; and the presence of reactive transition metals, such as iron, nickel, or copper. The primary oxidative products are unstable. Hydroperoxides are rapidly degraded to aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and hydrocarbons. These secondary products are relatively stable and are responsible for the characteristic flavor and odor associated with rancid oils. Historically, manufacturers of edible oils relied on two analytic tests to determine the level of oxidation in oil: the free fatty acid percentage and peroxide value. Two additional measures, the anisidine value and the total oxidation value, have become the focus of attention. The percentage of free fatty acids in oil is an indication of fresh- ness. As oil ages, triglycerides are cleaved to glycerol and free fatty acids through hydrolysis. Free fatty acids are more prone to oxidation than triglycerides, so their presence in oils increases the possibility of ran- cidity. A fresh, carefully processed oil has a free fatty acid percentage of less than 0.05%. The peroxide value measures the level of hydroperoxides in oil. Hydroperoxides are the primary by-product of oxidation. For exam- ple, 4-hydroxy-hexenal is a by-product of DHA peroxidation known to be elevated in disease states.317 Peroxide value alone is not indicative of the actual oxidative state of the oil because hydroperoxides decom- pose rapidly to secondary by-products such as aldehydes. Therefore an oil might also have a low peroxide value as a result of extensive oxidation rather than due to low levels of oxidation. In theory, fresh oil would have a peroxide value of zero. In practice, most vegetable oils have peroxide values ranging from 0.1 to 1. Besides the peroxide value, the anisidine value must also be calculated. The anisidine value is a measure of the amount of α - and β - unsaturated aldehydes. Anisidine is an aromatic amine. Synonyms for anisidine include aminoanisole, methoxyaniline, methoxyphenyl- amine, and methoxybenzenamine. Anisidine has two isomeric forms. Both were reported to enhance mutagenicity in bacterial strains.318 The ortho-anisidine isomer was associated with bladder tumors. Data on carcinogenicity are almost exclusively on the ortho-isomer, not the para-isomer, which most companies focus on when they measure ani- sidine values in fish oils. The total oxidative value used to express the extent of oxidation of an oil is the sum of the peroxide value and the anisidine value. Tests for peroxide value should comply with the American Oil Chemists, Society (AOCS) Official Method Cd 8-53 and not exceed a maximum of 5 mEq/kg, whereas the para-anisidine value should comply with AOCS Official Method 18-90 and not exceed a maximum of 20. Many commercially available oils contain high levels of hydroper- oxides and secondary by-products of oxidation. In the 1990s, Shukla

and Perkins319 analyzed various oils for oxidative stability. Their results showed that fish oils were more prone to oxidation than vegetable oils. The total oxidation values of fish oils ranged from 20 to 60 compared with 5 to 20 for vegetable oils (Tables 80.2 and 80.3).19 Shukla and Perkins made the following recommendations to pre- vent oxidation during the manufacturing process42: • Always use top-quality, freshly produced raw materials stored in temperature- and humidity-controlled facilities. • Prevent exposure to oxygen by using closed, impermeable contain- ers. • Avoid exposure of raw materials to sunlight. • Use stringent quality control. • Use stainless-steel equipment. • Minimize heating of oil during processing. • Use antioxidants to prolong shelf life. • When using soft gelatin capsules, choose a shell with the lowest concentration of plasticizer possible. By the early 21st century, many manufacturers of fatty acid supple- ments and vegetable oils took the lead to protect consumers by pro- ducing oils with the lowest levels of oxidative by-products possible. Consumer education and accurate measurement of peroxide and ani- sidine values are vital to this effort.


A daily dose of 1000 mg EPA+DHA may be sufficient as a general health adjunct. However, for more therapeutic indications, the dos- age range based on most clinical studies is between 3 and 4 g/day of EPA+DHA. Research also suggests that biomarker assessment may be of value for determining the optimal dosage for a variety of conditions, especially protection against cardiovascular disease. In a small study, supplementation with 1296 mg EPA + 864 mg DHA per day increased the erythrocyte ω -3 index, a potential biomarker for at least cardiovas- cular disease risk, to near 8%.320 Interindividual differences in eicosa- noid metabolism as well as digestive and/or absorptive function, along with genetic polymorphisms, may call for more individualized dosing. As clearly evidenced by clinical trials such as those on RA, a benefit may not be seen for 2 to 3 months. The optimal ratio of EPA/DHA is not well established and may vary for individuals as well as conditions. Research in depression suggests that although DHA is the more prevalent fatty acid in brain tissue, EPA may be more clinically effective. This should be kept in mind when considering other conditions, such as fish oil supplementation for neu- rodegenerative disease. Also, the form of fish and fish oil supplements is an important con- sideration. In one small trial comparing cod liver oil supplementation with actual fish consumption, cooked salmon increased serum levels to a greater extent than cod liver oil, despite providing less total DHA/ EPA.321 This may be because in fish, the fatty acids are triacylglycerols and phospholipids, whereas in almost all refined fish oils used in stud- ies, EPA and DHA were in the ethyl ester form. Currently, EPA/DHA supplements are widely available in the triglyceride, phospholipid, and ethyl ester forms. Although several studies have shown similar absorp- tion for ethyl esters, phospholipids, or triglycerides, other studies have shown that EPA/DHA consumed as triacylglycerides increased the ω -3 index more rapidly and to a greater degree than the ethyl esters of DHA/EPA.322–324 However, the clinical significance of this advantage has not yet been demonstrated, especially with chronic administration.


Individuals known or suspected to have a bleeding disorder, as well as those prescribed therapeutic levels of aspirin or warfarin, should have their bleeding time parameters measured, although as previously described (see “Bleeding Time”), this risk is not likely to exist. Patients may benefit from fish oil when taking cyclosporine.325 Fish oil may also have synergistic or additive effects with the cholesterol- and triglycer- ide-lowering drugs pravastatin and simvastatin and have broader ther- apeutic value.326 Fish oil is likely to modulate the cytotoxicity of many chemotherapeutic agents, as previously described, to increase therapeu- tic efficacy without increasing toxicity. It may also reduce the adverse

effects of many chemotherapeutic regimens, including the unintentional loss of weight. It may increase the efficacy of some antidepressants with- out an increase in toxicity.269 A thorough review by Stargrove et al.327 found nearly every drug interaction to be a beneficial one.

# CONCLUSION

A substantial body of evidence continues to grow, documenting the safety and efficacy of uncontaminated n-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil for a broad range of diseases, as well as for improving optimal cel- lular and physiological function. The mechanisms by which EPA and DHA from fish oil modulate cellular function and membrane structure continue to be elucidated in greater detail, and the potential of bio- markers, such as the ω -3 index, and genetic variants related to fish oil metabolism highlight the need for individualized and targeted fish oil supplementation. The list of conditions for which fish oil is of benefit extends well beyond this chapter because its use has been researched for most medical conditions. Many of the common and most well-established uses for fish oil have been highlighted, such as for cardiovascular dis- ease and modulation of inflammatory activity. The growing contam- ination of fish and the potential decline in worldwide fish stocks are of considerable concern, especially given the broad-ranging benefit of this underconsumed nutrient. Also, a growing awareness of the importance of not just n-3 intake but also of the ratio of n-6 fatty acids may help increase the efficacy of its nutritional modulation. One arti- cle cited that despite a 0.005% change in human genes over the past 10,000 years, an extraordinarily significant shift in the ratio of n-6:n-3 has occurred, which might help explain so many of today’s modern illnesses.31

consistently one of the most active of the flavonoids in experimental studies, and many medicinal plants owe much of their activity to their high quercetin content.

<!-- chunk -->

## Citrus Bioflavonoids

Citrus bioflavonoid preparations can include rutin, hesperidin, quer- citrin, and naringin. Most of the clinical research on rutin and crude bioflavonoid complexes occurred before 1970. Since then, most of the clinical research has used a standardized mixture of rutinosides known as hydroxyethylrutosides (HERs). Impressive clinical results have been obtained in the treatment of capillary permeability, excessive bruisabil- ity, hemorrhoids, and varicose veins with HERs (discussed in the sec- tion “Collagen Matrix Support”). Citrus bioflavonoids can be viewed as providing similar effects to, but probably not as potent as, HERs or quercetin.


As a class of compounds, flavonoids have been referred to as “nature’s biological response modifiers” because of their ability to modify the body’s reaction to other compounds, such as allergens, viruses, and carcinogens, as evidenced by their anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antiviral, and anticarcinogenic properties.2 In addition, flavonoids act as powerful antioxidants, providing remarkable protection against oxidative and free-radical damage3; they also have the ability to traverse the blood–brain barrier, thus exerting a neuroprotective effect.4 Flavonoids are known to form strong ligand complexes with heavy-metal ions and may prove to be a good agent for heavy-metal detoxification.1 The practical aspect of this antioxidant activity was highlighted by the results of a study in 805 men designed to determine the effect of dietary flavonoids on protecting against heart disease. The study demonstrated an inverse correlation between flavonoid intake and death from a heart attack.5 This effect was probably a result of the potent antioxidant effects of the flavonoids prevent- ing, similar to vitamins C and E, the formation of oxidized choles- terol. However, the antioxidant activity of flavonoids is generally more potent and effective against a broader range of oxidants than the traditional antioxidant nutrients like vitamins C and E, sele- nium, and zinc.6,7 Because different flavonoids tend to provide different benefits, additional and more specific beneficial effects are discussed under the key selected flavonoid categories. There is significant overlap among these flavonoids, however.

## Quercetin

Quercetin consistently demonstrates the greatest activity among the flavonoids studied in experimental models, particularly in vitro studies. The primary actions that are briefly reviewed here are its anti-inflammatory effects, inhibition of aldose reductase, antiviral activity, and anticancer properties.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-inflammatory Effects

Quercetin has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity because of direct inhibition of several of the initial processes of inflam- mation via interaction with calcium channels or calmodulin (the intra- cellular calcium-binding protein), or both. It works through other mechanisms as well, such as inhibiting mast cell and basophil degran- ulation, neutrophil and monocyte lysosomal secretion, prostaglandin (most notably, leukotriene) formation, lipid peroxidation, and the resultant cascade of effects that is often a result of these processes. For example, it inhibits both the manufacture and release of histamine and other allergic/inflammatory mediators. In addition, it exerts potent antioxidant activity and vitamin C–sparing action.6–9

<!-- chunk -->

## Effect on Histamine Release

The release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils is involved in the pathogenesis of acute allergic and inflammatory responses. Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the human body but are found in higher concentrations in the blood vessels of the subepithelial connective tissue of the respiratory tract, conjunctiva, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Mast cell and basophil degranulation is an active process that requires calcium influx. Quercetin and many other flavonoids have been shown to be potent inhibitors of mast cell, neutro- phil, and basophil degranulation. A generally accepted hypothesis for this action is that quercetin inhibits receptor-mediated calcium influx, thereby inhibiting the primary signal for degranulation. However, quercetin is also active under conditions in which the calcium channel mechanism is not operative, indicating that other mechanisms are responsible as well.6–9

## Membrane Stabilization, Antioxidant Activity, and

<!-- chunk -->

## Hyaluronidase Inhibition

Quercetin inhibits many of the inflammatory processes attributed to activated neutrophils. This effect is probably a result of its mem- brane-stabilizing action, potent antioxidant effect (which prevents the production of free radicals and inflammatory leukotrienes), inhi- bition of the enzyme hyaluronidase (thus preventing the breakdown of the collagen matrix of connective tissue and ground substance), and finally inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines. Quercetin’s membrane-stabilizing effect could also account for its action in pre- venting mast cell and basophil degranulation. This effect also inhibits inflammation by decreasing neutrophil lysosomal enzyme secretion.10 Neutrophils and monocytes contain lysosomes that, on secretion of their contents, contribute greatly to the inflammatory process.

## Effects on Eicosanoid Metabolism

Excessive leukotriene formation has been linked to asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, gout, ulcerative colitis, and possibly cancer. Quercetin has been shown to inhibit many steps in eicosanoid metabolism. Its inhibition of phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase enzymes is probably its most significant action (see Chapter 149 for diagram). The net result is a significant reduction in the formation of leukotrienes. The leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (composing the slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis) are derived from arachidonic acid and are 1000 times as potent as hista- mine in promoting inflammation. Leukotrienes promote inflammation by causing vasoconstriction (thereby increasing vascular permeability) and bronchoconstriction (thus inducing asthma) and by promoting white blood cell chemotaxis and aggregation. The reduction of leukot- riene formation by quercetin has significant anti-inflammatory effects.

## Inhibition of Aldose Reductase

Quercetin is a strong inhibitor of aldose reductase, the enzyme respon- sible for the conversion of blood glucose to sorbitol. This compound is strongly implicated in the development of diabetic complications such HOO OOH OH OH OH

as diabetic cataracts, neuropathy, and retinopathy.11 The mechanism by which sorbitol is involved in the development of diabetic compli- cations is best understood by considering its involvement in cataract formation. Although the lens does not have any blood vessels, it is an actively metabolizing tissue that continuously grows throughout life. Elevated blood sugar levels result in shunting of glucose to the sorbitol pathway. Because the lens membranes are virtually impermeable to sorbitol and lack the enzyme required to break down sorbitol (polyol dehy- drogenase), sorbitol accumulates to high concentrations. These high concentrations persist even if glucose levels return to normal. This accumulation creates an osmotic gradient that results in water being drawn into the cells to maintain osmotic balance. As the water is pulled in, the cell must release small molecules like amino acids, inositol, glu- tathione, niacin, vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium to maintain osmotic balance. Because these latter compounds function to protect the lens from damage, their loss results in an increased susceptibility to damage. As a result, the delicate protein fibers within the lens become opaque, and a cataract forms. Quercitrin, which is hydrolyzed by gut bacteria to yield quercetin and a sugar moiety, was shown to significantly decrease the accumu- lation of sorbitol in the lens of diabetic animals, effectively delaying the onset of cataracts.12 In addition to its effect on aldose reductase, quercetin is also of value in diabetes for its ability to enhance insulin secretion and protect the pancreatic β cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, and for its inhibition of platelet aggregation.6,7

## Antiviral Activity

Flavonoids as a group possess significant antiviral activity, with quer- cetin having the greatest antiviral activity against herpes virus type I, parainfluenzae 3, poliovirus type I, and respiratory syncytial virus.13 Quercetin was shown, in vitro, to inhibit both viral replication and infectivity. In vivo studies in animals also showed quercetin to inhibit viral infection.14 This would suggest that quercetin might be of some benefit in viral infections, including the common cold.

## Anticancer Properties

Many flavonoids have also been shown to inhibit tumor formation, but again quercetin has consistently been the most effective. In experi- mental models, quercetin demonstrated significant antitumor activity against a wide range of cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma; leukemia; and cancers of the breast, ovaries, colon, rectum, and brain. The cancer-preventive effects of quercetin have been attributed to various mechanisms, including antioxidative activity, inhibition of enzymes that activate carcinogens, modification of signal transduction pathways, and interactions with receptors and other proteins, such as the androgen receptor involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer.15–17 Clinically, quercetin holds great promise in reversing multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. Transporter-mediated active efflux of cytotoxic agents is one of the best-characterized mechanisms by which cancer cells develop MDR. Quercetin demonstrated multitar- geted effects in reversing MDR.17

## Collagen Matrix Support

In addition to possessing antioxidant activity and an ability to increase intracellular levels of vitamin C, rutin, hesperidin, and HER exert many beneficial effects on capillary permeability and blood flow, primarily via strengthening endothelial cells and supporting collagen structures. Collagen, the most abundant protein of the body, is responsible for maintaining the integrity of “ground substance” and the integrity of tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. Collagen is also the support struc- ture of the skin and blood vessels. Citrus flavonoids affect collagen metabolism in several ways. They reinforce the natural cross-linking of collagen that forms the so-called collagen matrix of connective tissue and protect against free-radical damage with their potent antioxidant and free-radical– scavenging action. They also inhibit enzymatic cleavage of collagen by enzymes secreted by leukocytes during inflammation and microbes during infection. Like quercetin, citrus flavonoids also prevent the release and synthesis of compounds that promote inflammation and allergies, such as histamine, serine proteases, prostaglandins, and leu- kotrienes.8,9 It is believed that the citrus bioflavonoid hesperidin pos- sesses antihistaminic activity through its metabolite heparitin, a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes. This metabolite is produced as a product of intestinal bacteria, which underscores the need for a balanced intestinal flora to gain the antihistamine benefits of citrus bioflavonoids.18

## Bone Metabolism Effects

Histomorphometric research on ovariectomized mice showed that marked decreases in trabecular bone volume and trabecular thickness of the femoral distal metaphysis were significantly prevented by hes- peridin. Additionally, calcium, phosphorus, and zinc concentrations in the femur were significantly higher in the hesperidin-fed group, whereas serum and hepatic lipids were lower in mice that consumed hesperidin-containing diets.19

# PHARMACOKINETICS

Before discussing the clinical applications of quercetin, it is important to address absorption and metabolism. Previous pharmacokinetic studies in animals and humans indicated that little quercetin is absorbed intact, with the majority of the oral dose (53%) being excreted in the feces.20,21 One of the main problems in studying the absorption of quercetin and other flavonoids is their degradation by microorganisms in the colon. To sidestep this issue, one study examined the absorption of querce- tin in healthy ileostomy patients with complete small intestines.22 The study examined the absorption of quercetin from fried onions (a rich source of quercetin glycosides), rutin, or 100 mg of pure quercetin. Absorption was defined as oral intake minus ileostomy excretion and corrected for degradation within the ileostomy bag. Absorption results were as follows: 52% from onions, 17% from quercetin rutinoside, and 24% for pure quercetin. These results indicate that humans do absorb appreciable amounts of quercetin and that absorption (but not nec- essarily pharmacological activity) may be enhanced when quercetin is bound to glucose. In other words, citrus bioflavonoid preparations or HERs, or both, may prove to be more effective clinically. Subsequent studies shed additional light on the absorption and metabolism of quercetin. In a study of 35 healthy volunteers, the volunteers were randomly assigned to take 50, 100, or 150 mg/day (groups Q50, Q100, and Q150, respectively) of quercetin for 2 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of the supplementation period. Compared with baseline, quercetin supple- mentation significantly increased plasma concentrations of quercetin by 178% (Q50), 359% (Q100), and 570% (Q150). The pharmacoki- netics of quercetin were investigated in a subgroup of 15 volunteers. The areas under the plasma concentration–time curves ranged from 76.1 to 305.8 μ mol/min/L(−1) (50- and 150-mg doses, respectively). Median maximum plasma concentrations of quercetin (431 nmol/L) were observed 360 minutes after intake of 150 mg of quercetin.23 In a much larger study, 1002 subjects were randomized to one of three groups: Q-500 (500 mg/day), Q-1000 (1000 mg/day), or placebo.

## 616SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Quercetin supplementation over 12 weeks caused a significant increase in overnight-fasted plasma quercetin, with a net increase of 332 and 516 mcg/L for Q-500 and Q-1000 compared with 53.6 mcg/L for pla- cebo. However, the increase in plasma quercetin was highly variable within each quercetin supplementation group.24 Quercetin is significantly metabolized into conjugates and smaller molecules. When healthy adults were given 1000 mg of quercetin daily for 3 months, it was extensively converted to isorhamnetin-3- glucuronide, which had the highest concentration at 3 months, fol- lowed by quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-sulfate, and quercetin diglucuronide.25 Quercetin should be administered with dietary fat because it leads to improved absorption through intestinal micellization.26 Given the relatively poor bioavailability and high variability of absorption among subjects, improved clinical results may be achieved with newer forms of quercetin, such as enzymatically modified isoquer- citrin (EMIQ) or phosphatidylcholine-bound quercetin to overcome these shortcomings (discussed in the section “Commercial Forms”).

## Allergic and Inflammatory Conditions

Largely on the basis of in vitro studies, quercetin appears to be indi- cated in virtually all inflammatory and allergic conditions, including asthma, hay fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, and in diabetes and cancer. Clinical documentation in these areas, however, is lacking. In a study using a highly bioavailable EMIQ, very good results were achieved. In a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design, 20 subjects with hay fever caused by Japanese cedar pollino- sis took two capsules daily of 100 mg EMIQ or a placebo for 8 weeks during the pollen season. During the entire study, the total ocular score and the ocular itching score for the EMIQ group were significantly lower than those of the placebo group. When limited to the individual periods, the total symptom score for the EMIQ group was significantly lower than that for the placebo group. The levels of serum cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, interferon- γ , and eotaxin and immunoglobulin-E, were not significantly downregulated by the intake of EMIQ, but the serum concentrations of oxidized low-den- sity lipoprotein and thymus and activation-regulated chemokines were reduced.27 In another study of EMIQ in subjects with hay fever caused by Japanese cedar pollinosis, 24 subjects took 100 mg EMIQ or a placebo for 8 weeks, starting 4 weeks before the onset of pollen release. During the entire study period, the ocular symptom plus medication score for the EMIQ group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group. When limited to the pollen release period, ocular symptom scores and ocular congestion scores for the EMIQ group were significantly lower than that for the placebo group, whereas other scores for the EMIQ group, such as ocular itching scores, lacrimation scores, and ocular congestion scores, all tended to be lower. However, no significant dif- ferences were found in nasal symptoms between the two groups. These results indicate that EMIQ is useful in reducing the ocular symptoms of hay fever, especially ocular congestion.28 Topical application of quercetin showed anti-inflammatory effects. In a study of 40 patients with aphthous stomatitis randomly divided into two groups (group 1 patients used a benzydamine hydrochloride mouthwash three times daily; group 2 patients placed two to three dabs of quercetin three times daily directly on their ulcers), the topical application of quercetin cream to minor mouth ulcers relieved pain and produced complete healing in seven of the group 2 patients (35%) in 2 to 4 days, in 18 patients (90%) in 4 to 7 days, and in 20 patients (100%) in 7 to 10 days. Although aphthous ulcers typically resolve on their own in 1 to 2 weeks, the daily topical application of quercetin might be useful in accelerating the healing process of minor aphthous ulcers.29

## Performance, Ergogenic, and Mitochondrial Effects

By far the most popular application, quercetin is in beverages designed for athletic performance. The commercial success of this application led to significant scientific investigation of quercetin’s ability to improve physical performance. In a number of clinical trials, quercetin was shown to improve mental/physical performance and reduce infection risk after intense exercise.30 In one small trial, 12 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: (1) 500 mg of quercetin twice daily dissolved in vitamin-enriched Tang or (2) a nondistinguishable placebo (Tang). Baseline maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and bike- ride times to fatigue were established. Treatments were administered for 7 days using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design. After treatment, both VO 2 max and ride time to fatigue were determined. Seven days of quercetin feedings were associated with a modest increase in VO 2 max (3.9% vs. placebo) along with a substantial (13.2%) increase in ride time to fatigue. These data suggest that as little as 7 days of quercetin supplementation can increase endurance with- out exercise training in untrained participants. However, a similar study using treadmill testing failed to show the same sort of effect.31 In a more detailed study, 26 young adult males were given querce- tin (1 g/day) or placebo for 2 weeks and then crossed over.32 Subjects provided blood and muscle biopsy samples before and after supple- mentation periods and underwent 12-minute time trials on 15% graded treadmills after 60 minutes of moderate exercise preloads at 60% VO 2 max. Plasma quercetin levels rose significantly during the 2-week quercetin supplementation period. Quercetin produced a 2.9% increased net distance in the 12-minute trial; skeletal muscle messenger RNA expression tended to increase (range, 16%–25%) during quercetin use for sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 α , cytochrome-c oxidase, and citrate synthase. Muscle mitochondrial DNA (relative copy number per diploid nuclear genome) increased by 4.1% with quercetin compared with a 6.0% decrease with the placebo. This result seems to indicate that querce- tin does provide some benefit in improving physical performance in untrained volunteers. In regard to moderately trained men and women, the data are not clear on indicators of performance, but quercetin showed other bene- fits in this group. In one study, 58 subjects were randomly assigned to quercetin (1 g/day) or placebo groups. Six weeks of dietary quercetin supplementation did not improve VO 2 max or other indicators of per- formance.33 In double-blind studies, however, quercetin (1 g/day) was shown to reduce upper respiratory infections in moderately trained individuals.34,35 Of 20 trained male cyclists who received quercetin or placebo before, during, and for 2 weeks after a 3-day period in which subjects cycled for 3 hours/day at approximately 57% maximal work- load, only 1 of 20 developed upper respiratory infection symptoms in the quercetin group compared with 9 of 20 in the placebo group.34 In another study, a reduction in upper respiratory tract infection total sick days and severity was noted in middle-aged and older subjects ingesting 1000 mg/day quercetin for 12 weeks who rated themselves as physically fit.35 Although one small study of 16 male soldiers supplemented with 500 mg of quercetin twice daily showed no benefit in improving aerobic athletic performance (i.e., 75 minutes of loaded treadmill marching and a subsequent cycling time trial to complete 200 kJ of work,36 a study with phosphatidylcholine-bound quercetin (Quercetin Phytosome), a more bioavailable form of quercetin, has been shown to be of particu- lar benefit to athletes.

## 617CHAPTER 81 Flavonoids—Quercetin, Citrus Flavonoids, and Hydroxyethylrutosides

Phytosome was shown to improve performance time and reduce postex- ercise muscular pain, cramps, and recovery time.37 These benefits were attributed to its ability to reduce oxidative stress. Quercetin also exerts significant support for the immune system and antiallergy effects. This product is best for allergies, food sensitivities, and athletes.


Various studies indicated quercetin and citrus bioflavonoids benefi- cially affected cardiovascular risk factors. In animal studies, increases in high-density lipoprotein and decreases in low-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol, total lipid, and triglyceride plasma levels in normolipidemic rats and in rats with diet and induced hyperlipidemia were observed.38 Animal studies also showed antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive rats.39 EMIQ was even more effec- tive based on animal studies that evaluated the antihypertensive effects and antiatherogenic effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats.40,41 A variety of human studies substantiated some of these effects and many more. Hesperidin and quercetin both improved endothelial function.42,43 In particular, quercetin at a dosage of 200 mg/day aug- mented nitric oxide status and reduced endothelin-1 concentrations to improve endothelial function. In a pilot study with quercetin-4 ′ -O- β -d-glucoside, which, like EMIQ, is a prodrug for quercetin, subjects given either 50 or 300 mg had significant inhibition of platelet aggrega- tion at 30 and 120 minutes after ingestion.44 In one study, the effect of quercetin supplementation on blood pressure, lipid metabolism, markers of oxidative stress, inflamma- tion, and body composition was studied in an at-risk population of overweight-obese volunteers (aged 25–65 years of age) with metabolic syndrome traits in relation to apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E) genotype.45,46 Participants were randomized to receive 150 mg/day quercetin in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with 6-week treat- ment periods separated by a 5-week washout period. Participants were classified into the following three Apo-E phenotypes: Apo-E2 (n = 3), Apo-E3 (n = 60), and Apo-E4 (n = 26). Data were analyzed for the Apo-E3 and Apo-E4 subgroups. Quercetin decreased systolic blood pressure by 3.4 mm Hg in the Apo-E3 group, whereas no significant effect was observed in the Apo-E4 group. Quercetin decreased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (i.e., from 52–47 mg/dL), resulting in a slightly increased ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the Apo-E4 subgroup, whereas the Apo- E3 subgroup had no significant changes in these variables. Quercetin significantly decreased plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein and tumor necrosis factor- α in the Apo-E3 and Apo-E4 groups, whereas no significant intergroup differences were found. Serum C-reactive protein and nutritional status (body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, fat-free mass) were unaffected compared with placebo. In con- clusion, quercetin exhibited blood pressure–lowering effects in over- weight-obese carriers of the Apo ε 3/ ε 3 genotype but not in carriers of the ε 4 allele. Although the degree of blood pressure reduction was not clinically meaningful in this study, in another randomized, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 730 mg/day of querce- tin for 28 days was shown to lead to meaningful reductions in systolic (−7 mm Hg), diastolic (−5 mm Hg), and mean arterial pressures (−5 mm Hg) in stage 1 hypertensive patients.47 The exact mechanism for quercetin is not known, although one study showed that it is not related to inhibiting the activity of angio- tensin-converting enzyme or endothelin-1 nitric oxide production.48 Quercetin is definitely cardioprotective; at a dosage of 120 mg per day, it was shown to reduce the total time and number of episodes of ST-segment depression and the number of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) as demonstrated with 24 hour Holter electrocar- diogram (ECG) monitoring.49

## Gout

Quercetin may be helpful in gout through inhibition of xanthine oxidoreductase, the final step in intracellular uric acid production. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 22 healthy males (19–60 years) with baseline plasma uric acid concentration in the higher, but still considered healthy, range (339 [SD 51] μ mol/l) were given either a tablet containing 500 mg of quercetin or a placebo daily for 4 weeks, with a 4-week washout period between crossover treat- ment. After quercetin treatment, plasma uric acid concentrations were significantly lowered by –26·5 μ mol/l. This amount of 500 mg of quer- cetin contains the same bioavailable amount of quercetin as present in approximately 100 g of red onions.50

## Chronic Venous Insufficiency, Capillary Fragility,

<!-- chunk -->

## Excessive Bruisability, and Hemorrhoids

A deficiency of hesperidin in the diet was linked with abnormal cap- illary leakiness, and pain in the extremities, causing aches, weakness, and night leg cramps.51 Early studies demonstrated rutin to be effec- tive in reducing capillary fragility, easy bruising, swelling and bruising after sports injuries, and nosebleeds.52–54 More recent and much more extensive studies were performed with HERs. Positive double-blind clinical studies exist in the treatment of venous insufficiency, includ- ing varicose veins, hemorrhoids, diabetic vascular disease, and diabetic retinopathy.55–67 In double-blind studies of patients with chronic venous insuffi- ciency, HER improved microvascular blood flow and clinical symp- toms (pain, tired legs, night cramps, and restless legs) in 73% to 100% of patients.55–66 Several studies were conducted on pregnant women, in whom HER was shown to be of great benefit in improving venous function and in helping relieve hemorrhoidal signs and symptoms. In one study, 90% of the women given HER (1000 mg/day for 4 weeks) had improved symptoms compared with only 12% in the placebo group.66 Similar results in hemorrhoids not associated with pregnancy were also reported.65 In a very practical study, the effects of HER at a dose of 1 g/day on the prevention and control of flight microangiopathy and edema were studied in subjects with varicose veins and moderate chronic venous insufficiency who flew for more than 11 hours.64 Measurements of skin laser Doppler resting flux venoarteriolar response, ankle swelling, and edema were made within 12 hours before and within 3 hours after the flights. The resulting edema after the flights was evaluated with a composite edema score (analog scale line). A group of 20 subjects was treated with HER (1 g/day, starting 2 days before the flight and 1 g for every 12 hours on day of travel). Another group of 18 subjects formed the control group. The length of the flights was between 11 and hours; all seats were in coach class. Fifty patients were enrolled, and 38 patients were evaluable at the end of the trial. The results showed clearly that HER was useful for reducing the level of microangiopa- thy and the increased capillary filtration and in controlling edema in patients with venous disease during long flights. The higher level of flux and venoarteriolar response and the reduction in edema indicated a positive effect of HER on microcirculation. There are a number of natural therapeutic agents to choose from in chronic venous insufficiency. In a double-blind study, the effects of HER were compared with micronized diosmin plus hesperidin (D+H). A first group of 90 patients with severe venous hypertension was randomized to treatment with HER or D+H. The HER group received oral HER (2 g/day); the D+H group received three 500-mg tablets daily every 8 hours for 8 weeks. A second group of 122 comparable patients was included in a registry following the same study format. The results show that HER was more effective in relieving signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency and improving the quality-of-life scale in this study.63

## 618SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


Flavonoids appear to be important in the long-term care of diabetes for many reasons. One of the hallmark features of diabetes is a signifi- cant disturbance in blood flow through the small blood vessels. HERs appear to improve blood flow in diabetics significantly and can be use- ful in the treatment of diabetic microvascular disease and retinopathy. Flavonoids can also stimulate an otherwise weak insulin effect in sev- eral ways. For example, they can influence the protein phosphokinases, which modulate second-messenger pathways known to upregulate the gene encoding the glucose transporters.1 PCOs or bilberry extracts may be better than quercetin, citrus flavonoids, and HER in diabetics.

## Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with low levels of the adipose-derived hormone adiponectin, even in the absence of adipos- ity. Because quercetin may reduce serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels and increases the expression and secretion of adi- ponectin, researchers conducted a double-blind study in 84 women with PCOS. The treatment group received 1 g of quercetin (two 500-mg capsules) daily for 12 weeks, and the control group received a placebo. Quercetin slightly increased the level of total adiponectin by 5.56% and high-molecular-weight adiponectin by 3.9% compared with placebo. It also reduced the level of testosterone (0.71 ng/dL in quercetin vs. 0.77 ng/dL in placebo) and luteinizing hormone (LH; 8.42 IU/l in quer- cetin vs. 8.68 IU/l in placebo). HOMA-IR levels were also significantly lower in the quercetin (1.84) group compared with the placebo group (2.21). These results indicate that quercetin may have some benefit in the treatment of PCOS.68

## Thalassemias

Although it may be difficult to treat the long-term outcomes of thal- assemia conditions, it is possible that quercetin may serve to protect abnormally sensitive lymphocytes from common dietary substances. An in vitro study evaluated the effect of food mutagens on the lympho- cytes from three different types of thalassemia patients: β -thalassemia major, β -thalassemia/Hb E, and a β -thalassemia trait with a 3.7-kb deletion. When the mutagen exposure was combined with quercetin, reduced sensitivities among the various thalassemic genotypes were observed in a dose-dependent manner.69 Although human studies are necessary to confirm this beneficial effect, quercetin might be worth a try to attenuate the toxic mutagenic effects commonly found in these susceptible patients.

# COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FORMS

## Quercetin

Quercetin is available alone in powder and capsule form. However, if quercetin is being used for its anti-inflammatory properties, prod- ucts that combine it with the pineapple enzyme bromelain may pro- vide additional benefit. Bromelain (see Chapter 71) exerts antiallergy and anti-inflammatory activity on its own and may also enhance the absorption of quercetin. Combination preparations of protein- digesting enzymes, like bromelain, and flavonoids have been shown to potentiate each other’s anti-inflammatory activity.70 EMIQ is a new form of quercetin that showed greater absorp- tion in both human and animal studies. It is prepared by enzymatic deglycosylation and the subsequent α -oligoglucosylation of querce- tin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin). The plasma level of quercetin conjugates is instantly increased by oral intake of EMIQ.71,72 In a rat study, the absorption of EMIQ was compared with quercetin, quercetin-3-O- rutinoside (rutin), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercitrin [IQC]), quercetin-3-O- maltoside (Q3M), quercetin-3-O-gentiobioside (Q3G), α -monoglucosyl rutin ( α -MR), and α -oligoglucosyl rutin ( α -OR). Bioavailability (F value) was calculated from the concentrations of total quercetin in plasma from 0 to 12 hours after administration. The F value of quercetin was 2.0%, and those of IQC, Q3M, and EMIQ were 12%, 30%, and 35%, respectively. Quercetin Phytosome® (phosphati- dylcholine-bound quercetin) has shown even greater bioavailability.73 On a weight-equivalence basis, 500 mg of Quercetin Phytosome®, containing 200 mg of quercetin, versus 500 mg of quercetin produced blood levels 20 times greater than the quercetin.

## Citrus Bioflavonoids

Mixed preparations of citrus bioflavonoids are the most widely used and least expensive flavonoid sources. However, mixed citrus flavo- noids are the least active and generally the least quantified source of fla- vonoids because most commercially available sources of mixed citrus flavonoids only contain 50% flavonoids. Preparations containing pure rutin and hesperidin or those that clearly state the levels of rutin and hesperidin are superior to products that do not quantify the amount of the individual flavonoid components. HERs are probably the better choice when opting for the benefits in this class of flavonoids.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dosages

The usual recommended dosage for quercetin is 500 mg two times daily. If quercetin is being used for its anti-inflammatory properties and bromelain supplementation is also indicated, administration with bromelain may enhance absorption. Combination preparations of proteolytic enzymes and flavonoids have been shown to have signifi- cant anti-inflammatory activity in experimental studies.70 If used with bromelain, the amount of bromelain (1800 milk clotting units [mcu]) should be equal to the amount of quercetin. Dosages used for HERs in double-blind clinical studies for the treatment of venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids ranged from to 3000 mg/day. This translates to a dosage of citrus bioflavonoids, rutin, and hesperidin of 3000 to 6000 mg/day.

## Toxicity

Quercetin appears to be well tolerated in humans. A Phase I dose-es- calation study was performed to evaluate the safety of quercetin in untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Quercetin exhibited safety (up to 5 g daily), and there was a potential for antiviral activity in some hepatitis C patients. Quercetin also produced a “clini- cally meaningful” 0.41-log viral load decrease in eight of the subjects.74 Carcinogenic and teratogenic studies in rats and rabbits showed that quercetin does not have apparent side effects, even when con- sumed in large quantities (2000 mg/kg body weight and 5%–10% of total diet) for long periods of time (up to 2 years).75–81 In addition, quercetin administration (up to 2000 mg/kg body weight) to pregnant rats had no teratogenic effects.80 The weight of the available evidence supports the safety of quercetin.82 As is true of any other compound, allergic reactions may occur. Although uncommon, if they occur, dis- continue use. EMIQ has the status of generally recognized as safe in the United States. Citrus bioflavonoids, rutin, hesperidin, and HER appear to be extremely safe and without side effects even during pregnancy.

## Drug Interactions

Rutin, hesperidin, and HER do not appear to interact with any drug. Quercetin was shown to elevate the plasma concentrations of fex- ofenadine in healthy subjects, probably via the phosphoglycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated efflux in humans.82 The Pgp enhances the uptake from the intestine of many drugs, including vinblastine, cyclospo- rine, digoxin, fexofenadine, and losartan, and can also increase the

oral bioavailability of drugs like nifedipine, felodipine, verapamil, and terfenadine, and inhibit the breakdown of various drugs, particularly caffeine, coumarin, and estrogens. Quercetin significantly induced the activity of Pgp, and this induced effect was more obvious in MDR1 3435 TT individuals.83 Unlike naringin from grapefruit, quercetin does not appear to affect CYP2C8 activity and has little possibility of interacting with drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme.84 Citrus bioflavonoid preparations generally are not an issue. However, if derived from grapefruit, they may contain naringin and interact with many drugs. Naringin activates Pgp and suppresses the expression of the cytochrome P450 3A4 gene that can enhance oxi- dative decomposition of some drugs, including drugs used frequently in the therapy of cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, immune disorders, hypertension, and other serious conditions.85 Avoidance of grapefruit juice and flavonoid preparations containing naringin is rec- ommended where drug interactions are likely.

## 621CHAPTER 82 Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo Tree)

(Fig. 82.2). These substances are unique to ginkgo and are not found in any other plants. Other constituents of GBE include several organic acids. These compounds contribute valuable properties to the extract by making the usually water-insoluble flavonoid and terpene mole- cules of ginkgo water soluble.


G. biloba is the world’s oldest living tree species. The sole surviving species of the family Ginkgoaceae, the ginkgo tree can be traced back more than 200 million years to the fossils of the Permian period, and for this reason, it is often referred to as the “living fossil.” Once common in North America and Europe, the ginkgo was almost destroyed during the Ice Age in all regions of the world except China, where it has long been cultivated as a sacred tree. In the late 17th century, Engelbert Kaempfer, a German physician and botanist, became the first European to discover and catalog the ginkgo tree. The flavonoid kaempferol is named after Kaempfer. In 1771 Linnaeus named the tree G. biloba. The ginkgo tree was brought to America in 1784 to the garden of William Hamilton near Philadelphia. The ginkgo tree is now planted throughout much of the United States as an ornamental tree. The ginkgo tree, which is the tree most resistant to insects, disease, and pollution, is frequently planted along streets in cities. The first green growth to reappear at the center of Hiroshima in 1946 was the sprout of a ginkgo tree that grew to be a normal, full-size tree. G. biloba’s medicinal use can be traced back to the oldest Chinese materia medica (2800 bc). Ginkgo leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for their ability to “benefit the brain,” relieve the symptoms of asthma and coughs, and help the body eliminate filaria. In the late 1990s, ginkgo leaf extracts were among the leading prescription medicines in both Germany and France, where they accounted for 1% and 1.5%, respectively, of total prescription sales. In America, it was the top-selling botanical medicine in 1999, with $148 million in sales.1 Ginkgo’s popularity has waned a bit in the 21st cen- tury, but it remains among the top-selling natural products in Europe and North America.


The GBE extract standardized to contain 24% ginkgo flavone glyco- sides has demonstrated remarkable diverse pharmacological effects. Interestingly, the total extract is more active than single isolated com- ponents. This suggests synergism between the various components of GBE, an explanation that is well supported in more than 2000 clinical and experimental studies using the extract.

## General Effects

GBE exerts profound, widespread tissue effects, including mem- brane-stabilizing, antioxidant, and free-radical–scavenging effects. GBE also enhances the use of oxygen and glucose.2,3,4 Red blood cells provide excellent models for evaluating the effects of substances on membrane functions. Red blood cell studies using GBE demonstrated that in addition to directly stabilizing membrane structures and scavenging free radicals, GBE also enhanced membrane transport of potassium into the cell and sodium out of the cell by acti- vating the sodium pump. In essence, GBE leads to better membrane polarization. This effect is particularly important in excitable tissues such as nerve cells.2,3 GBE prevents metabolic and neuronal distur- bances in experimental models of cerebral ischemia.2,3,5–8 It accom- plishes this by enhancing oxygen use and increasing cellular uptake of glucose, thus restoring energy production. GBE also helps reestablish effective tissue perfusion during hypoxia. Particularly interesting is GBE’s ability to normalize the circulation in areas most affected by microembolization, namely, the hippocampus and striatum. GBE promotes an increased nerve transmission rate, improves synthesis and turnover of brain neurotransmitters, nor- malizes acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus (the area of the brain most affected by Alzheimer’s disease), and inhibits β -amyloid deposition.9 Although the sample size was small, a study was conducted to eval- uate the effects of a 6-week supplementation with 160 mg/day of a standardized extract of G. biloba or a matching placebo on aerobic per- formance, blood antioxidant capacity, and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in healthy, physically active young men, Flavonoids O O H O O O HO HO X= H Ginkgolide A X= OH Ginkgolide B O X OH O O O O O O OH OH O x OH OH OHO HO X= H Kaempferol X= OH Quercetin X= OCH 3 Isorhamnetin GinkgolidesBilobalide

randomly allocated to two groups (n = 9 each). At baseline, and on the day after the treatment, the participants performed an incremen- tal cycling test for the assessment of maximal oxygen uptake. Results showed that six weeks’ supplementation with G. biloba extract in phys- ically active young men may provide some marginal improvements in their endurance performance, expressed as VO ₂ max and blood anti- oxidant capacity, and elicit somewhat better neuroprotection through increased exercise-induced production of BDNF.10

## Vascular Effects

The mechanisms of GBE’s vascular effects were investigated using a number of in vivo and in vitro techniques (Table 82.1). Isolated ves- sel techniques allowed for the separation of GBE’s effects on different parts of the vascular system (e.g., arterial, arteriolar, microcirculatory, venular, and venous components), whereas in vivo studies provided information on the total circulatory phenomena (i.e., GBE’s ability to increase the perfusion rate to various regions). In general, GBE exerts its vascular effects primarily through its effects on the lining of the blood vessels (vascular endothelium) and the system that regulates blood vessel tone. Its vasodilating action is explained by direct stimulation of the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin (a beneficial prostaglandin). In addi- tion, GBE inhibits ′ ,5 ′ -cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodi- esterase, an enzyme that results in relaxation of blood vessels.2,11 On the venous system, GBE stimulates greater tone, thus aiding the dynamic clearing of toxic metabolites that accumulate during ischemia (Fig. 82.3).2,11 GBE normalizes circulation by producing tonic effects. These effects are much more apparent in an ischemic vascular area than in a normally perfused area. However, despite intense investigation, many of GBE’s tonic effects on vascular components are still largely unex- plained. GBE can simultaneously combat the phenomena resulting from vascular spasm and, with the same efficiency, restore circulation to areas subject to vasomotor paralysis. The importance of this dual action is becoming more apparent in cerebral insufficiency because single-direction drugs (i.e., vasodilators) can often aggravate the condition by preferentially dilating the healthy areas, thereby deflecting blood and oxygen away from the ischemic area. Another prime clinical application of GBE’s effects on vascular endothelium is early-stage diabetic nephropathy. In one 8-week clin- ical trial, in the GBE group, the brachial arterial endothelium-depen- dent dilation increased from 4.91% before treatment to 6.78% after treatment, whereas the level of von Willebrand factor decreased from 182% to 128.5%, and nitrous oxide increased from 50.16 to 70.65 μ mol/L.12 GBE also protects against endothelial damage caused by oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, thereby preserving endothelial adhesive properties and disruption of ionic homeostasis.13

## Platelet Effects

GBE and isolated ginkgolides have profound effects on platelet func- tion, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, adhesion, and degranulation.4 These effects appear to be a result of direct membrane and antioxidant effects, increased synthesis of prostacyclin, and antag- onism of platelet-activating factor (PAF). GBE and the ginkgolides were shown to be potent inhibitors of PAF.4,14–16 PAF is a potent stimulator of platelet degranulation and is involved in many inflammatory and allergic processes, including neutrophil activation, increased vascular permeability, smooth mus- cle contraction (e.g., bronchoconstriction), and reduction in coronary blood flow. GBE and ginkgolides compete with PAF for binding sites and inhibit the various events induced by PAF.2,3,17,18 These actions may be responsible for many of GBE’s clinical effects. Interestingly,

despite these effects on PAF, GBE exerts no inhibition of platelet aggre- gation in humans.

# ABSORPTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF GINKGO

# BILOBA EXTRACT

The pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, and elimination) of GBE were studied in rats using radiolabeled extracts.2,3,4 After oral administration, at least 60% of the radiolabeled extract was absorbed. Because blood levels peaked after 1.5 hours, upper gastrointestinal tract absorption was suspected. The flavonoids appear to have an affinity for organs rich in connec- tive tissues, such as the aorta, eyes, skin, and lungs. Levels of radioac- tivity in these tissues are two to three times higher than those in blood and decrease little over time. Retained specific activity in the heart is twice that found in the skeletal muscles. Of the glands, the adrenals retain the greatest level of radioactivity. At 72 hours, the hippocampus and striated bodies show radioactiv- ity five times greater than that of the blood. This deposition pattern, which parallels the circulation improvement observed after ischemia caused by blood clotting in rats, is alleviated by GBE extracts. Other areas of the brain, such as the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and cerebel- lum, do not show such high levels of radioactivity. Complexing GBE with phospholipids showed that the bioavail- ability of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin was increased sig- nificantly, indicating these preparations might offer the best clinical response.19 For central nervous system effect, complexing GBE with phosphatidylserine may prove superior to phosphatidylcholine (dis- cussed in the section “Cerebral Vascular Insufficiency and Impaired Mental Performance”).20


GBE’s primary clinical application has been in the treatment of vas- cular insufficiency. In more than 50 double-blind clinical trials, both patients with chronic cerebral arterial insufficiency and those with peripheral arterial insufficiency responded favorably to GBE. As described earlier, GBE exerts an extraordinary array of pharmacolog- ical activities that imply a broad spectrum of possible clinical applica- tions, an implication borne out by the new applications of GBE, which are constantly being discovered.

## Cerebral Vascular Insufficiency and Impaired Mental

## Performance

Cerebral vascular insufficiency is an extremely common condition in the elderly of developed countries because of the high prevalence of atherosclerosis. In well-designed studies, GBE displayed a statistically significant regression of the major symptoms of cerebral vascular insuf- ficiency and impaired mental performance, including the following: • Short-term memory loss • Vertigo • Headache • Ringing in the ears • Lack of vigilance • Depression Regression of these symptoms by GBE suggests that vascular insuffi- ciency may be the major causative factor accounting for these so-called age-related cerebral disorders versus a true degenerative process. In a comprehensive review, the quality of research on more than clinical studies with GBE in the treatment of cerebral insufficiency was analyzed. The results indicated that GBE was effective in reducing all symptoms of cerebral insufficiency, including impaired mental func- tion (senility). The quality of research was comparable to Hydergine (dihydroergotamine), a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of cerebral vascular insufficiency and Alzheimer’s disease. Eight studies stood out as being extremely well designed and are summarized in Table 82.2.14–17,21–23 It appears that by increasing cerebral blood flow, and therefore oxygen and glucose use, GBE offers relief from these effects of aging and may offer significant protection against their development. G. biloba’s antiaggregatory effect on platelets offers additional pro- tection against a stroke. This was supported in a clinical study of post- stroke patients, which demonstrated that GBE improved blood flow and blood viscosity.24 In another study using dynamic susceptibility

contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, elderly human sub- jects taking a modest dosage of 60 mg of GBE for 4 weeks experienced a significant increase of global cerebral blood flow, 15% in white matter and 13% in gray matter.25 In addition to improving blood supply to the brain, experimental and clinical studies showed that GBE increased the rate at which infor- mation was transmitted at the nerve cell level.26,27 One study investi- gated the effects of acute doses of standardized GBE on memory and psychomotor performance in 31 healthy volunteers who were 30 to 59 years old.28 It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a five-way crossover design. Ginkgo improved working memory in all volunteers, especially those who were 50 to 59 years old. Fifty patients aged 50 to 85 years with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and associated dual-task-related gait impairment participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory Phase IV drug trial of a G. biloba extract (Symfona forte 120 mg).29 Subjects were divided into two groups. Patients allocated to the intervention group (IG) received standardized GBE LI 1370 (Symfona forte mg; 25% standardized flavone glycoside, 6% terpene lactone content) twice daily for 6 months, whereas patients in the control group (CG) received identically appearing placebo capsules. After 6 months, dual- task-related cadence increased in the IG compared with the CG. This suggests that in patients with MCI, 120 mg of GBE twice daily for at least 6 months may improve dual-task-related gait performance. In the open-label phase, the IG was able to maintain most effects on the spatiotemporal gait parameters, indicating that long-term GBE intake over 1 year may be required to elicit more pronounced effects.30 GBE’s memory-enhancing effects are not limited to the elderly. In another double-blind study, the reaction time in healthy young women performing a memory test was improved significantly after admin- istration of GBE.31 GBE complexed with phosphatidylserine might show even better results in these sorts of applications. In one study, 28 healthy young participants received 120 mg GBE, 120 mg GBE complexed with phosphatidylserine (Virtiva), 120 mg GBE complexed with phosphatidylcholine, and a matching placebo, on separate days days apart.19 Cognitive performance was assessed using the Cognitive Drug Research computerized test battery and Serial Subtraction tasks immediately before dosing and at 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 hours thereafter. In keeping with previous research utilizing the same methodology, mg of GBE was not associated with markedly improved performance on the primary outcomes. However, administration of Virtiva resulted both in improved secondary memory performance and significantly increased speed in memory-task performance across all postdose test- ing sessions. Enhancement after GBE complexed with phosphatidyl- choline was restricted to a modest improvement in secondary-memory performance, which was restricted to one postdose time point.

## Cognitive Dysfunction

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a central role in cognitive control functions, and dopamine in the PFC modulates cognitive control, thereby influencing attention, impulse inhibition, prospective mem- ory, and cognitive flexibility. Because reduced prefrontal dopamine has been associated with impaired cognitive control,32 interventions that improve prefrontal dopaminergic functions are of interest. A ran- domized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial in 61 elderly volunteers with subjective memory impairment was conducted to evaluate the effects of GBE on cognitive functions related to prefron- tal dopamine.33 Indications for improved cognitive flexibility without

changes in brain activation suggested increased processing efficiency with GBE, and together with a trend for improved response inhibition, results were compatible with mild enhancement of prefrontal dopa- mine. Ginkgo’s putative neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties have provided support for its use in treating neurological, psychiatric, functional, and physiological symptoms, including prob- lems with memory, information processing, attention and concen- tration, psychomotor function, mood, fatigue, and activities of daily living. Clinical studies have shown that the cognitive domains yielding the largest proportion of significant effects of GBE versus placebo are in the following areas33–38: • Fluid intelligence • Selective attention • Short-term and long-term verbal and visual memory • Executive functions (e.g., planning, working memory, flexibility, and processing speed)

## Alzheimer’s Disease

GBE has been extensively investigated in cases of dementia, includ- ing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition to GBE’s ability to increase functional brain capacity via the mechanisms described earlier, it was shown to normalize the acetylcholine receptor in the hippocampus of aged animals, increase cholinergic transmission, inhibit β -amyloid deposition,9 and address many of the other major elements of AD.2,3,39 Although preliminary studies in established AD patients were quite promising, at this time it appears that at best GBE only helps reverse or merely delay mental deterioration in the early stages of AD. However, even this application is fraught with conflicting results in double-blind studies. That is, in several studies, no benefit over placebo was observed in halting cognitive decline.40 In more advanced cases of AD, GBE does not offer any significant advantage over placebo. The benefits of GBE in early-stage AD were quite evident in sev- eral double-blind studies and a meta-analysis of studies of more than 6 months’ duration.41 In one study, 216 patients with AD or multiin- farct dementia were given either 240 mg/day of GBE or placebo for 24 weeks.42 Improvements were noted in several clinical parameters, including the Clinical Global Impressions scale (Table 82.3). Similar results were seen in another double-blind study, in which the 240-mg dose was administered once daily.42 One study that deserves special mention is the first U.S. clini- cal study on GBE published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.43 The study was conducted at six research centers. Harvard Medical School and the New York Institute for Medical Research approved the design of the study, in which 202 patients with AD were given either a modest dose of GBE (120 mg/day) or a pla- cebo for 1 year. GBE not only stabilized AD but also led to significant improvements in mental function in 64% of the patients. There were no side effects with GBE. The results from these positive studies indicate that GBE in ear- ly-stage AD or other causes of dementia may lead to some mild cogni- tive improvement and help enable patients maintain a normal life and avoid being institutionalized. It is important to point out that direct comparison studies on ginkgo versus standard pharmaceutical regimens indicated similar efficacy in AD. A comparative analysis of studies of at least 6 months in duration demonstrated that GBE and second-generation cholinesterase inhib- itors (e.g., tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, metrifonate) were equally effective in treating mild to moderate AD.44 In a meta-analysis of articles that examined the effect of ginkgo on objective measures of cognitive function in patients with AD, using standardized measures of cognition including the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–cogni- tive subscale, it was concluded that GBE produced comparable benefits to standard cholinesterase inhibitors.45 In addition to possibly being beneficial in early-stage AD, if the mental deficit is a result of vascular insufficiency or depression and not AD, GBE is usually effective in reversing the deficit.2,3,4,46 Importantly, GBE should be taken consistently for at least 12 weeks to determine its effectiveness. Although some people with AD report benefits within a 2- to 3-week period, most will need to take GBE for a longer period of time.

## Tinnitus

Permanent, severe tinnitus is an extremely difficult condition to treat. Previous studies showed contradictory results of GBE in the treatment of tinnitus. For example, in Meyer’s study,47 GBE improved the condi- tion in all patients regardless of prognostic factor. However, in Coles’s study,48 21 patients with tinnitus took GBE for 12 weeks: 11 reported no change, 4 reported slight to very slight improvement, and 5 reported that their tinnitus was worse. A possible explanation for these different results is that in Meyer’s study, the patients had recent-onset tinnitus, whereas in Coles’s study, 18 patients had tinnitus for at least 3 years. A 1994 study of GBE in tinnitus used a two-part design: the first part was an open part, without a placebo control, and the second part was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.49 The 80 patients in the open study were referred to the Department of Audiology, Sahlgren’s Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden, because of perma- nent severe tinnitus. Twenty patients reporting a positive effect with GBE (14.6 mg twice daily) after 2 weeks were recruited for the dou- ble-blind study. Patients were given either GBE or placebo for 2 weeks and then crossed over into the other group. The evaluation indicated that six patients preferred GBE, seven preferred placebo, and seven had no preference. On the surface, this study seemingly indicated that GBE was ineffective for permanent, severe tinnitus. However, the study was designed for the GBE to fail. First, the dosage used (14.6 mg twice daily or 29.2 mg/day) was far less than the standard dosage of 40 mg three times daily (or roughly four times the daily dosage used in the study). Secondly, in studies on patients with cerebral vascular insufficiency, it is well established that GBE often takes at least 2 weeks before benefits become apparent. The longer that GBE is used, the more obvious the benefit. In a condition like permanent, severe tinnitus, 2 to 4 weeks is simply not enough time. However, given the small, insufficient dosage, it probably would not have mattered if the subjects had been studied for a longer period of time. A study of 1121 healthy people between 18 and 70 years old with tinnitus that was comparatively stable showed no benefit over pla- cebo when given 50 mg of standardized ginkgo three times a day.50 Although these data were discouraging, it should be noted that out- come measures were obtained through questionnaires and phoned-in patient reports, without objective audiometric metering.

## 626SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

A review study of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of GBE was conducted to determine the effectiveness of standardized extract (EGb 761) in the treatment of tinnitus.51 The authors con- cluded there was evidence of efficacy for the standardized extract in the treatment of tinnitus from three trials in patients in whom tinnitus was the primary complaint, and supportive evidence exists from five trials in patients with age-associated cognitive impairment or dementia in whom tinnitus was present as a concomitant symptom. In all identified and retrieved studies using the standardized GBE (EGb 761®), this spe- cific preparation was found to be superior to placebo in the treatment of tinnitus. The degree to which GBE is of benefit in permanent, severe tinnitus remains to be determined, but given GBE’s excellent safety profile, it is certainly worth a try.

## Cochlear Deafness/Ototoxicity

Ischemia is usually the underlying factor in acute cochlear deafness. GBE improved recovery in cases of acute cochlear deafness caused by unknown factors or caused by sound trauma or pressure (baro- trauma).52 GBE was also shown to be a protective agent against oto- toxicity from treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, without decreasing antineoplastic efficacy.53

## Senile Macular Degeneration and Diabetic Retinopathy

GBE appears to effectively address the multifactorial pathophysiology of senile macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in adults. In double-blind studies, GBE demonstrated a statistically sig- nificant improvement in long-distance visual acuity in both macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.54,55 GBE has also demonstrated impressive protective effects against free-radical damage to the retina in experimental studies. Furthermore, GBE was shown to prevent dia- betic retinopathy in rats, suggesting it might have a protective effect in humans as well.2

## Peripheral Arterial Insufficiency

The primary lesion of peripheral arterial disease is the same cholester- ol-containing plaque that is responsible for other conditions associated with atherosclerosis (e.g., coronary artery disease, cerebral vascular insufficiency). The arterial obstruction or narrowing causes a reduction in blood flow during exercise or at rest. Clinical symptoms are caused by the consequent ischemia. The most common symptom of peripheral arte- rial disease is pain during exertion as a result of intermittent claudica- tion. The pain usually occurs in the calf and is described as cramping, tightness, or severe fatigue. The pain is usually bilateral. The cause of the pain is not only reduced oxygen delivery but also an increase in the production of toxic metabolites and cellular free radicals. These free radicals accumulate and react with the lipid constituents of the cell membrane. Pain at rest indicates a serious reduction in resting blood flow. It is obviously a sign of severe disease. The pain may be localized to one or more toes, or it may have a stocking-type distribution. The character of the pain is usually described as burning or gnawing and is generally worse at night. Cyanosis or pallor of the extremity is usually appar- ent. In moderate to severe narrowing of the artery, there are trophic changes, including a dry, scaly, and shiny epidermis. Hair may disap- pear, and the toenails may become brittle, ridged, and deformed. In nine double-blind, randomized clinical trials of GBE versus pla- cebo in two matched groups of patients with peripheral arterial insuf- ficiency of the leg, GBE was shown to be quite active and superior to placebo (eight studies) and equal to pentoxifylline (one study).2,3,4,55–60 Not only did measurements of pain-free walking distance (75%–110%) and maximum walking distance (52.6%–119%) dramatically increase, but plethysmographic and Doppler ultrasound measurements also demonstrated increased blood flow through the affected limb. Blood lactate levels also dropped. In studies following strict methodology and with a sufficient num- ber of patients for reliable evaluation, the demonstration that GBE improves limb blood flow, and improves walking tolerance, indicates that GBE is far superior to pentoxifylline, cilostazol, and standard medical therapy in peripheral arterial insufficiency. This includes other peripheral vascular disorders such as diabetic peripheral vascular dis- ease, Raynaud’s disease, acrocyanosis, and postphlebitis syndrome. In the treatment of intermittent claudication, the effects are somewhat modest, especially compared with exercise programs.61,62 The longer GBE is used, the greater the benefit. Table 82.3 summa- rizes a 2-year trial of GBE (160 mg/day) in the treatment of periph- eral arterial disease (Fontaine stage IIb). Pain-free walking distance increased by more than 270%.2 The usual daily dosage of GBE is 120 mg (40 mg three times a day); however, some of the studies employed a dosage of 160 mg/day, including the study summarized in Table 82.3. Given the excellent safety profile of GBE, dosages similar to those used in cerebral vascular insufficiency (e.g., 240 mg/day) may prove to be more effective.

## Sexual Dysfunction

Most cases of impotence (erectile dysfunction) are caused by impaired blood flow to erectile tissue. Evidence indicates that GBE might be extremely beneficial in the treatment of erectile dysfunction caused by lack of blood flow. Sixty patients with proven erectile dysfunc- tion who had not reacted to papaverine injections up to 50 mg were treated with 60 mg/day GBE for 12 to 18 months.63 The penile blood flow was reevaluated by duplex sonography every 4 weeks. The first signs of improved blood supply were seen after 6 to 8 weeks. After months’ therapy, 50% of the patients regained potency, and in 20%, a new trial of papaverine injection was then successful; 25% of the patients showed an improved blood flow, but papaverine was still not successful. The remaining 5% were unchanged. The improvement of the arterial inflow to erectile tissue is assumed to be because of the known effect of GBE on enhancing blood flow through both arteries and veins without any change in systemic blood pressure. Ginkgo’s effects are more apparent with long-term therapy, and better results may have been obtained with a 120-mg/day dose to take full advantage of its effect on improving blood flow. Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction is a prevalent side effect of most conventional antidepressant drugs. A study of women and 30 men on selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) showed an overall 84% effectiveness rate at curbing symp- toms, with GBE exhibiting a positive effect on all four phases of the sexual response cycle: desire, excitement (erection and lubrica- tion), orgasm, and resolution (afterglow).64 This research group also demonstrated the efficacy of ginkgo for these side effects after other management trials of cyproheptadine, yohimbine, amantadine, and buspirone hydrochloride failed. In a study in women with sexual arousal disorder, a single dose of 300 mg GBE had a small but significant facilitatory effect on physio- logical, but not subjective, sexual arousal compared with placebo in 99 women with sexual dysfunction.65 Long-term GBE administration at this dosage did not significantly enhance arousal responses beyond placebo. The authors concluded that (1) neither short- nor long-term administration of GBE alone substantially affected sexual function in women, (2) a substantial placebo effect on sexual function existed in women with sexual concerns, and (3) teaching women to focus on gen- ital sensations during sex enhanced certain aspects of women’s sexual functioning.

## Premenstrual Syndrome and Idiopathic Cyclic Edema

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is often characterized by fluid reten- tion, vascular congestion, increased capillary permeability, and breast tenderness. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study sought to deter- mine the effectiveness of GBE in treating these symptoms.66 The pop- ulation studied was a group of 165 women between the ages of 18 and 45 years who had congestive symptoms for at least three cycles. The patients were then assigned to receive either GBE (80 mg twice daily) or placebo from day 16 of the cycle to day 5 of the next. On the basis of extensive symptom evaluation by patients and physicians, it was concluded that GBE was effective against the congestive symptoms of PMS, particularly breast pain or tenderness. Patients taking GBE also noted improvements in neuropsychologic assessments. These results indicate that GBE might hold some promise in the treatment of PMS.

## Antidepressant Effects

The ability of GBE to improve general mood in patients with cerebral vascular insufficiency in double-blind studies led researchers to begin investigating GBE’s antidepressive effects. In a double-blind study, 40 elderly patients (ranging from 51–78 years old) with depression who had not benefited fully from standard antidepressant drugs were given either 80 mg of GBE three times daily or a placebo.67 By the end of the eighth week, the total score of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression in the GBE group dropped from 14 to 4.5. In comparison, the placebo group dropped from 14 to only 13. This study indicated two things: 1. GBE can be used with standard antidepressants. 2. GBE enhanced the effectiveness of standard antidepressants, partic- ularly in patients older than 50 years of age. Importantly, the dosage used in the study (80 mg three times daily) was higher than the standard dosage of 40 mg three times daily. See the previous section “Sexual Dysfunction” regarding ginkgo’s ability to decrease unwanted side effects of standard antidepressant medications.

## Allergies/Asthma

Mixtures of ginkgolides, and GBE standardized to contain 24% ginkgoflavonglycosides, showed clinical effects in allergic conditions because of their inhibition of PAF, a key chemical mediator in asthma, inflammation, and allergies.16,17 In one double-blind placebo study, the ability of a mixture of gink- golides to block the effects of PAF when PAF was injected into the skin was investigated.16 Normally, when PAF is injected, it causes an imme- diate formation of a hive (classic wheal and flare reaction). However, if the ginkgolide mixture (120 mg) was given before PAF injection, it effectively counteracted the wheal and flare reaction. Specifically, the ginkgolide reduced the flare (reddened) area by a mean of 62.4% and the wheal (hive) volume by a mean of 60%. A study from the Qingdao Hospital of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine in Shandong, China, assessed the efficacy of an oral ginkgo liquor to alleviate airway hyperreactivity. It was found that the treatment significantly reduced airway inflammation and improved the pulmonary function and clinical symptoms of asthmatic patients.68 Mixtures of ginkgolides, and purified ginkgolides, are under inves- tigation in several European countries. The hope is that they will be proven clinically effective in eczema, allergies, and many other condi- tions in which PAF plays a central role.16,17

## Raynaud’s Disease

Most common in young women (60%–90% of reported cases), Raynaud’s disease is a condition of vasospastic response that causes areas of the body, including the fingers, toes, and tips of the nose and ears, to feel numb and cool in response to cold temperatures or stress. During a Raynaud attack, these blood vessels that supply the skin nar- row, limiting blood circulation to affected areas. Ginkgo’s vasodilating activity is most likely responsible for its effectiveness in treating this condition. Given the side-effect profile of pharmaceutical treatments for Raynaud’s disease, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study evalu- ated the use of GBE to treat this difficult condition. A 10-week trial revealed a 56% reduction in the number of weekly attacks, whereas pla- cebo reduced the number by 27%.69 The World Health Organization recommends the use of ginkgo in Raynaud’s disease, acrocyanosis, and postphlebitic syndrome.70

## High-Altitude Sickness

In a study involving a Himalayan expedition of moderate altitude with gradual exposure, 44 volunteers were divided into a placebo group and a group that received 80 mg of ginkgo twice a day.71 No subject in the ginkgo group developed acute mountain sickness, unlike 40.9% of subjects in the placebo group. Vasomotor disorders of the extremities were also prevented in the ginkgo group.

## Future Applications of Ginkgo biloba Extract

There are many preliminary studies indicating possible clinical appli- cations for GBE. For example, several studies have also shown the ben- efits of GBE on kidney function. One animal study showed improved kidney blood flow and function in hypertensive rats.72 Another study found that ginkgo protects the kidneys from glyphosate.73 Other ani- mal studies have shown protection of the kidneys from mercury, ura- nium, naphthalene, and many other toxins.74–76 Ginkgo also protects the kidneys from gut-derived endotoxins.77 Ginkgo also has the ability to protect against numerous mitochondrial toxins, which strengthens the case for its use in kidney disease because mitochondrial damage in the kidneys mediates much of the nephrotoxicity.78 Other potential applications of GBE include angina, congestive heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Its action on PAF may also make it useful for a great number of other applications in addition to allergies, including various types of shock, thrombosis, graft protection during organ transplantation, multiple sclerosis, and burns.


Most of the clinical research on G. biloba used a standardized extract, containing 24% ginkgo flavone glycosides, has utilized dosages of to 240 mg per day, usually in divided doses. Devising a dosage schedule using other forms of ginkgo is diffi- cult because of extreme variation in the content of active compounds in dried leaf and crude extracts. Whatever form of ginkgo is used, it appears to be essential that it is standardized for content and activity. For example, a standard 1:5 tincture obtained from crude ginkgo leaf with the highest possible flavonoid content would require 1 oz/day to provide the equivalent dosage level of the standardized extract. Clinical research clearly shows that GBE should be taken consis- tently for at least 12 weeks to determine effectiveness. Although most people report benefits within 2 to 3 weeks, some may take longer to respond.


GBE is extremely safe, and side effects are uncommon. In 44 dou- ble-blind studies involving 9772 patients taking GBE, the number of side effects reported was extremely small. The most common side

effect, gastrointestinal discomfort, occurred in only 21 cases, followed by headache (7 cases) and dizziness (6 cases).4,46 Because of its inhibi- tion of PAF, many practitioners are concerned that ginkgo may increase bleeding risk when used concurrently with warfarin (Coumadin), aspi- rin, and other antiplatelet therapies. However, a study evaluating the use of ginkgo and warfarin concurrently revealed no change in the international normalized ratio (INR), which is the blood test chosen to monitor the patient’s possible bleeding risk in response to antico- agulation therapy.79 Results from controlled studies consistently indi- cated that ginkgo did not significantly affect bleeding time or platelet aggregation, and it did not adversely affect the safety of coadministered aspirin or warfarin.80 In contrast to the tolerance of the leaf extract, contact with or inges- tion of the fruit pulp produced severe allergic reactions.81,82 Contact with the ginkgolic acids in the fruit pulp causes erythema and edema, with the rapid formation of vesicles accompanied by severe itching. This is similar to an allergic reaction to the poison ivy, oak, and sumac group, suggesting cross-reactivity between G. biloba fruit and this fam- ily. Ingestion of as little as two pieces of fruit pulp was reported to cause severe gastrointestinal irritation from the mouth to the anus. Because the ginkgo leaf does have a low level of irritative ginkgolic acids, animal studies were conducted to examine the possibility of adverse reactions from using ginkgo leaf extract. It was concluded that extracts of G. biloba taken orally were considered safe.81


Ginkgo has been shown to have antagonistic effects on anesthetics, analgesics, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents because of gink- go’s inhibition of platelet aggregation.82 As a result of these concerns, ginkgo should be used cautiously in patients taking these medications. Because of its inhibition of PAF, many practitioners are con- cerned that ginkgo may increase bleeding risk when used concurrently with warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, and other antiplatelet therapies. However, a study evaluating the use of ginkgo and warfarin concur- rently revealed no change in the international normalized ratio (INR), which is the blood test chosen to monitor the patient’s possible bleed- ing risk in response to anticoagulation therapy.83 Results from con- trolled studies consistently indicated that ginkgo did not significantly affect bleeding time or platelet aggregation, and it did not adversely affect the safety of coadministered aspirin or warfarin.84 In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover trial found that G. biloba extract had no significant pharmacodynamic effects on warfarin and had no effects on prothrombin time and acti- vated partial thromboplastin time.85 Prudent caution suggests that patients taking warfarin should have their INRs closely monitored or refrain from ginkgo use. Human clinical trials have demonstrated no clinically signifi- cant effects on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4.86,87 Ginkgo should be used with caution, or avoided, concomitantly with antiretrovirals because it may decrease the levels of selected anti- viral therapies.88,89 Regarding the pharmacokinetic herb–drug interactions, the intake of standardized G. biloba extract together with synthetic drugs appears to be safe if daily doses up to 240 mg are consumed.90

of macromolecular hexosamine (GAG) than NAG. It is possible that NAG does not penetrate the cell membranes and, as a result, is unavail- able for incorporation into glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides.7 The body preferentially uses GS rather than NAG. This preference appears largely because of the active processes that enhance absorption of GS in the intestines.9 The absorption of NAG by humans is poor for several reasons: • NAG is quickly digested by intestinal bacteria. • NAG binds with dietary lectins in the gut, resulting in a lectin–NAG complex, which is excreted in the feces. • A large percentage of NAG is metabolized by intestinal cells. In addition to the question of absorption, articular tissue cannot use NAG as well as it does glucosamine. These absorption and utilization prob- lems suggest NAG is highly unlikely to possess the same kind of antiarthritic and anti-inflammatory properties that GS has been shown to possess.

## Glucosamine Sulfate Versus Glucosamine Hydrogen

## Chloride

Sulfur is an extremely important component in the therapeutic effect of GS, and its substitution is likely to decrease the efficacy of supplemen- tal glucosamine. Sulfur is an essential nutrient for joint tissue, where it functions in the stabilization of the connective tissue matrix of cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. Even healthy humans have low serum sulfate (0.3–0.4 mM) and synovial sulfur levels, but in OA, these concentra- tions are even lower. As far back as the 1930s, researchers demonstrated that individuals with arthritis were commonly deficient in this essential nutrient.10,11 Restoring sulfur levels brought about significant benefit to these patients. In addition to sulfur playing a critical role in the manu- facture of GAGs like chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate, sulfur was shown to inhibit the various enzymes that lead to cartilage destruction in OA (e.g., collagenase, elastases, and hyaluronidase).12 Because one of the primary effects of GS is to promote the man- ufacture of GAGs, a lack of the sulfur moiety may mean less GAG synthesis when glucosamine HCl is used. Therefore it is unlikely that glucosamine HCl will show the same excellent clinical results achieved with GS because it lacks this critical element. Results from double-blind studies indicated that glucosamine HCl might be no more effective than a placebo in relieving OA. One double-blind, placebo-controlled, 10-week study examined the effects of glucosamine HCl in patients with OA of the knee.13 Patients received either 500 mg of glucosamine HCl or a placebo three times daily. Forty-five patients received glucosamine HCl, whereas 53 received the placebo. The results indicated that 49% of patients who received glucosamine HCl felt they had improved compared with 45% of the placebo group. However, the differ- ence between the two groups was not statistically significant. What these results call into question is the viability of glucosamine HCl as an effective form of glucosamine. Unfortunately, several large, well-publicized studies utilized this form. For example, the Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) study involved 1583 patients with symptomatic knee OA.14 Patients were randomized to receive 1500 mg of glucosamine daily, mg of chondroitin sulfate daily, both glucosamine and chondroi- tin sulfate (same dosages as the single arms), 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. The mean age of the patients was years, and 64% were women. Overall, glucosamine and chondroi- tin sulfate were not significantly better than placebo in reducing knee pain by 20%. Compared with the rate of response to placebo (60.1%), the rate of response to glucosamine was 3.9% higher, the rate of response to chondroitin sulfate was 5.3% higher, and the rate of response to combined treatment was 6.5% higher. The rate of response in the celecoxib control group was 10.0% higher than that in the placebo control group. For patients with moderate to severe pain at baseline, the rate of response was significantly higher with combined therapy than with placebo (79.2% vs. 54.3%). In an analysis of GAIT subjects with a radiographic confirmation of OA, the odds of achieving a 20% reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score compared with placebo were as follows: celecoxib, 1.21; glucosamine, 1.16; combina- tion glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate, 0.83; and chondroitin sulfate alone, 0.69. These rates were not statistically significant.15,16

## Osteoarthritis

The primary use for GS is in the treatment of OA. This application has significant support in the medical literature because numerous dou- ble-blind studies have shown GS to produce much better results com- pared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), placebo, or acetaminophen in relieving the pain and inflammation of OA.17–21 Although some of the studies comparing GS with NSAIDs or acetamin- ophen showed similar reductions in pain and symptom scores, only GS improved indexes of joint function or markers showing improvement of cartilage structure. Typically, the advantages of GS over these other treatments were seen after 2 to 4 weeks of use, but there is some evi- dence that the longer GS is used, the greater the therapeutic benefit. Not all studies showed clear positive results; a few exist that showed no greater benefit for GS over placebo in improving symp- tom scores.22–26 However, it must be kept in mind that the placebo response in OA is quite high and may confound the true benefit of GS and other approaches to OA. Fortunately, there were several studies that showed objective improvements (discussed in the immediately following paragraphs). The two longest placebo-controlled trials were 3 years in dura- tion. The results from these studies showed, quite convincingly, that GS slowed down the progression of OA; produced regression of the disease in many cases, as noted by radiological improvements; and sig- nificantly reduced the incidence of total joint replacement even after as much as 5 years after GS discontinuation.27–30 In the first long-term study, 212 patients with knee OA were ran- domly assigned 1500 mg oral GS or placebo once daily for 3 years. Weight-bearing anteroposterior radiographs of each knee in full exten- sion were taken at enrollment and after 1 and 3 years. The mean joint- space width of the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint was assessed by digital image analysis, whereas the minimum joint-space width (i.e., at the narrowest point) was measured by visual inspec- tion with a magnifying lens. Symptoms were scored by the WOMAC OA index. The 106 patients on placebo had a progressive joint-space OH OH NH CH 3 O HO HO O

narrowing, with a mean joint-space loss after 3 years of −0.31 mm. No significant joint-space loss occurred in the 106 patients on GS (−0.06 mm). Similar results were reported with minimum joint-space nar- rowing. As assessed by WOMAC scores, symptoms worsened slightly in patients on placebo compared with the clinical improvement observed in the group that received GS.27 To investigate the relationship between baseline radiographic sever- ity of knee OA and the importance of long-term joint-space narrowing in more detail, a subanalysis of data from the 3-year trial was per- formed. Measurements of mean joint-space width, assessed by a com- puter-assisted method, were performed at baseline and after 3 years on weight-bearing anteroposterior knee radiographs. Those who received GS demonstrated a trend for significant reduction in joint-space nar- rowing in patients in the highest quartile of baseline mean joint-space width (>6.2 mm). In these patients, a joint-space narrowing of 14.9% occurred in the placebo group after 3 years, whereas patients from the GS group experienced a narrowing of only 6%.31 Of 414 participants randomized in the two long-term studies, 319 were postmenopausal women. In a subset analysis, after 3 years, postmenopausal participants in the GS group showed no joint-space narrowing, whereas participants in the placebo group experienced a narrowing of −0.33 mm. Percent changes after 3 years in the WOMAC index showed an improvement in the GS group (−14.1%) and a trend for worsening in the placebo group (5.4%). These results indicated that postmenopausal women might be especially responsive to GS.27 Additional insight into who might best respond to GS was provided in another analysis from this 3-year study that examined the ability of GS to improve a biochemical marker of collagen type II degradation (CTX-II).32 At baseline, the 212 patients had an average concentra- tion of urinary CTX-II of 222.4 ng/mmol creatinine. This was signifi- cantly above the CTX-II levels measured in urine samples from healthy controls (169.1 ng/mmol). Although there was no significant difference in the CTX-II response in the placebo group and the glucos- amine-treated group, those with high cartilage turnover presented a significant decrease in CTX-II after 12-month glucosamine treatment. The group with CTX-II concentrations above normal average plus 1 standard deviation decreased 15.5% after 12-month therapy. The change in CTX-II in these patients correlated with the change in aver- age joint-space width observed after 36 months. Increased baseline lev- els of CTX-II in the placebo group were associated with a worsening of the WOMAC index. These data indicate that measurement of urinary collagen type II C-telopeptide fragments enabled the identification of patients with high cartilage turnover, who appeared to be most respon- sive to GS therapy. In the second study, 202 patients with knee OA were randomized to receive oral GS (1500 mg once a day) or placebo. Changes in computed tomographic radiographic minimum joint-space width were measured in the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint, and symptoms were assessed using the Lequesne (an index of severity of osteoarthri- tis) and WOMAC. Although symptoms improved more significantly in the GS group, the most telling result was the fact that progressive joint-space narrowing with placebo use was −0.19 mm after 3 years, whereas there was no average change with GS use (an increase of 0.04 mm was the average).29 Although a 2-year double-blind study failed to show any difference with either GS (1500 mg) or chondroitin sulfate (CS 800 mg) either alone or in combination versus the placebo group in terms of pain reduction, the combination of both GS and CS produced a statistically significant reduction of joint-space narrowing compared with placebo, with a mean difference of 0.10 mm. These results indicate that even if symptomatic improvement is not observed, GS may be exerting posi- tive effects on joint structure.33 Another study sought to determine changes in levels of serum car- tilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and urine c-telopeptide of CTX-II as markers for cartilage turnover in patients with OA of the knee, in response to muscle strength training in combination with treatment with glucosamine, ibuprofen, or placebo. All three groups increased their muscle strength after 12 weeks of strength training. Glucosamine’s reduction of serum COMP was statistically significant compared with both placebo and ibuprofen; the mean reduction with glucosamine was 13% versus placebo and 17% versus ibuprofen. This suggested an effect by glucosamine on the response of the OA cartilage to a period of joint loading in humans with knee OA. No effect was noted on CTX-II.34 Several head-to-head, double-blind studies also showed that GS produced much better results compared with NSAIDs and analgesics in relieving the pain and inflammation of OA, despite the fact that GS exhibited little direct anti-inflammatory effect and no direct analge- sic or pain-relieving effects.35–39 Although NSAIDs and analgesics, like acetaminophen, offer purely symptomatic relief, and NSAIDs may actually promote the disease process, GS appears to address the cause of OA. By promoting cartilage synthesis, thus treating the root of the problem, GS not only relieves the symptoms but also helps the body repair damaged joints. The clinical effect is impressive, especially when glucosamine’s safety and lack of side effects are considered. In one of the earlier comparative studies in which GS (1500 mg/day) was compared with ibuprofen (1200 mg/day), pain scores decreased faster in the first 2 weeks in the ibuprofen group. However, by week 4, the group that received GS experienced a significantly better improve- ment than the ibuprofen group.35 Physicians rated the overall response as good in 44% of the GS-treated patients compared with only 15% of the ibuprofen group. Additional studies designed to further evaluate the compar- ative effectiveness of GS versus NSAIDs provided even better evi- dence.36–38,40 One study consisted of 200 subjects with OA of the knee given either GS (500 mg three times daily) or ibuprofen (400 mg three times daily) for 4 weeks.36 Consistent with previous studies, the ibuprofen group experienced quicker pain relief. However, by the end of the second week, the group taking GS experienced results as good as those in the ibuprofen group, with one major exception: although the side effects with glucosamine were mild and affected only 6% of the group, ibuprofen produced more significant side effects much more frequently, with 35% of the group experiencing them. A total of 319 patients with symptomatic OA of the knee received GS (1500 mg/day), piroxicam (20 mg/day), both drugs, or a placebo for 12 weeks followed by 8 weeks without treatment.37 The main efficacy variable was represented by the Lequesne index, a standard method of assessing disease activity. In the GS group, the Lequesne index decreased by 4.8 points during treatment, for a decrease of 2.9 and 0.7 points, in the piroxicam and placebo groups, respec- tively (p < 0.001). The association did not differ from GS alone. GS did not differ in safety (14.8% incidence of adverse events during treatment) from placebo (23.7%) but was significantly bet- ter tolerated than piroxicam (40.9%) or the association (35%). The improvement in GS-treated patients persisted during the 8-week follow-up period, whereas the improvement with piroxicam did not. These impressive results with GS were achieved without side effects. Patients on GS had fewer side effects than the placebo and no dropouts. Table 83.1 provides the side effect and dropout values among the four groups. In another study on OA of the knee (Table 83.2), GS showed com- parable symptomatic relief but was better tolerated and produced residual benefit after discontinuation.38

Another study showed an obvious advantage of GS over ibupro- fen in patients diagnosed with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) OA. In the double-blind study, 40 women and 5 men received either GS (500 mg) or ibuprofen (400 mg) three times daily for 90 days. Fifteen patients taking GS (71%) and 11 taking ibuprofen (61%) improved, with positive clinical response taken as a 20% decrease in TMJ pain and function. Between-group comparison revealed that patients taking GS had a significantly greater decrease in TMJ pain with function, effect of pain, and acetaminophen used between days 90 and 120 compared with patients taking ibuprofen.40 In addition to showing benefit in double-blind studies, oral GS was shown to offer significant benefit in an open trial involving 252 doc- tors and 1506 patients in Portugal.41 This large study provided valu- able clinical information on the appropriate use of GS. The patients received 500 mg of GS three times a day over a mean period of days. Symptoms of pain at rest, on standing, on exercise, and limited active and passive movements, all improved steadily throughout the treatment period. Objective therapeutic efficacy was rated by doc- tors as “good” in 59% of the patients and “sufficient” in a further 36%. Although this was not a controlled study, a 95% response rate is impressive. The results with GS were rated by both doctors and patients as being significantly better than those obtained with previous treatment, including NSAIDs, vitamin therapy, and cartilage extracts. GS produced good benefit in a significant portion of patients who did not respond to any other medical treatment. In the study, obesity was associated with a significant shift from good to fair. This finding may indicate that higher dosages may be required for obese individuals or that oral glucosamine is not enough to counteract the added stress of obesity on the joints. Patients with peptic ulcers and individuals taking diuretics were also associated with a shift from good to sufficient in terms of efficacy and tolerance. Individuals with peptic ulcers should take GS with foods. Individuals taking diuretics may need to increase the dosage to compensate for reduced effectiveness. The improvement with glucosamine lasted for to 12 weeks after the end of treatment.

## Recovery

GS may have a role as a preventive measure against the development of OA, especially in athletes subjected to joint strain, and an aid to recover from minor acute joint injuries (i.e., sprains and strains). One study investigated the chondroprotective action of GS on articular cartilage in athletes, the levels of biomarkers for CTX-II, and type II collagen synthesis (CPII) compared between soccer players and non- athlete controls before and after taking GS or placebo. CTX-II and CPII levels were substantially elevated in soccer players compared with those in controls, indicating that cartilage metabolism (CTX-II and CPII) was increased in soccer players. GS administration (1.5 and 3 g/day for 3 months) significantly decreased the CTX-II level; however, the effect disappeared after withdrawal of administration. In contrast, GS administration did not essentially affect the increased level of CPII. Furthermore, cartilage damage was evaluated using the ratio of CTX-II/CPII. The ratio in soccer players was significantly higher than that in controls, suggesting that CTX-II was relatively more enhanced compared with CPII in soccer players than in control students. Of tremendous importance, the ratio was reduced by glu- cosamine administration but returned to the preadministration level after GS supplementation ended. Together, these observations sug- gest that glucosamine is expected to exert a chondroprotective action in athletes (soccer players) by preventing CTX-II but maintaining CPII, although the effect is transient and disappears after stopping use.42 In a study designed to examine the effects of 4 weeks of glucosamine administration on functional ability and the degree of pain intensity in competitive male athletes after acute knee injury, 106 patients with an acute knee injury were randomized to either take GS (1500 mg/day) or a placebo for 28 days.43 No significant difference was found between the glucosamine and placebo groups in mean pain intensity scores for resting and walking and the degree of knee swelling at the 7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day assessments. There was no significant difference between passive knee flexibility at the 7-, 14-, and 21-day assessments, but after 28 days of treatment, the patients from the glucosamine group demon- strated significant improvement in knee flexion and extension com- pared with the placebo group. These results showed modest benefits and suggest use, but additional measures certainly should be used to speed recovery.

GS was also assessed for its ability to aid recovery in athletes under- going anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Thirty patients took either GS (1000 mg) or a placebo daily in addition to engaging in identical physical therapy. Results revealed significant improvements in both groups after 8 weeks, but no significant difference was detected between groups in any of the parameters. Although GS supplemen- tation did not improve the rehabilitation outcomes of athletes after ACL reconstruction, the study may not have used a sufficient dosage to observe an effect (see “Dosage” section).44


The standard dosage for GS is 1500 mg/day. It appears that adminis- tration as a single dosage may produce better results. Obese individ- uals may need higher dosages based on body weight (e.g., 20 mg/kg body weight daily). Individuals taking diuretics may also need to take higher dosages. Athletes or individuals who are subjecting their joints to greater wear and tear may need to increase the dosage to 3000 mg to maintain positive cartilage synthesis.

# SIDE EFFECTS AND TOXICITY

GS has an excellent safety record in animal and human studies. Because of these studies, many experts have recommended that GS “be consid- ered as a drug of choice for prolonged oral treatment of rheumatic disorders.” Side effects, when they do appear, are generally limited to light to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including stomach upset, heartburn, diarrhea, nausea, and indigestion. If these symptoms occur, GS should be taken with meals. Regarding people who are “sulfur sensitive,” an important distinc- tion must be made. When patients report they are allergic to sulfur, what they usually mean is that they are allergic to the so-called sulfa drugs or sulfite-containing food additives. It is impossible to be allergic to sulfur because sulfur is an essential mineral. The sulfate form of sul- fur is present in human blood. In short, GS is extremely well tolerated, and no allergic reactions have been reported. Concern has been expressed that glucosamine may influence insu- lin secretion or action, or both, based primarily on in vitro studies with concentrations of glucosamine not possible to achieve with oral supplementation or at recommended dosages. Detailed human stud- ies showed GS had no effect on insulin secretion or action in either healthy subjects, those with type 2 diabetes, or those with insulin resis- tance.45–48 Long-term studies with GS actually produced a nonsignifi- cant lowering of fasting blood glucose concentrations in all groups of subjects.48 One side effect that has come up in elderly subjects is that GS may increase intraocular pressure (IOP).49 In a double-blind study,44 patients with osteoarthritis were randomized into either GS (750 mg three times daily) or a placebo group. A comprehensive ophthalmo- logical examination including IOP was performed at baseline, month 1, and month 3. At 3 months, about 34% in the treatment group and 12.5% in the placebo group had clinically significant (defined as ≥ 2 mm Hg) rise in IOP. These results need to be confirmed, but physi- cians should monitor IOP in glaucoma patients taking GS.


GS may potentiate the effect of warfarin (Coumadin). The World Health Organization’s adverse drug reactions database documents spontaneous reports of increased international normalized ratio associ- ated with glucosamine use, 17 of which resolved when glucosamine was stopped. Two additional case reports also exist. Given the widespread use of GS, it does not appear to be a significant concern. Nonetheless, the use of warfarin and glucosamine may lead to an increased interna- tional normalized ratio, and physicians should monitor accordingly.50

## 635CHAPTER 84 Glutamine

can be broken down into glutamate and ammonia, which increases blood pH. Ammonia can bind hydrogen ions to produce ammonium cations, which are excreted in the urine along with chloride anions. Bicarbonate ions are simultaneously released into the bloodstream. Clinical studies showed that relatively small oral doses of glutamine can elevate plasma bicarbonate concentrations in healthy adults. In one study, 2 g of glutamine was dissolved in a cola drink and ingested over a 20-minute period 45 minutes after a light breakfast. Control subjects were given soda only. Blood samples were taken 1 week before, at baseline, and subsequently at three separate 30-minute inter- vals after ingestion of the glutamine drink or placebo. Eight of 9 sub- jects responded to the oral glutamine load with a significant increase in plasma glutamine at 30 and 60 minutes before returning to the baseline value at 90 minutes. Ninety minutes after the glutamine was admin- istered, plasma bicarbonate concentration was found to be increased. Circulating plasma growth hormone concentration was elevated as well. Concomitant with enhanced renal acid secretion, glutamine ingestion also caused an increase in the glomerular filtration rate.15 The authors of this study explained that their results showed that it was unlikely l-glutamine was a direct precursor of bicarbonate. Instead, l-glu- tamine appeared to play an indirect role in accelerating acid secretion through mechanistic changes in the kidneys. Human studies showed that urinary ammonium excretion is altered by changes in glutamine intake.16 Chronic metabolic acidosis is a common clinical problem encountered in catabolic states such as sepsis, shock, and diabetes, and is a major factor in many biological derangements.17 Because glutamine becomes an essential amino acid in catabolic states when the increased demand exceeds the body’s capability to synthesize it,18 glutamine supplementation may be quite useful to maintain pH homeostasis in patients with acidotic conditions.

## Glutathione Repletion

Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide consisting of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine (Fig. 84.3). As a reservoir source for glutamate in the body, the availability of glutamine appears crucial for the regeneration of glutathione stores in the liver during hepatic injury; in skeletal muscle after major trauma, sepsis, or surgery; and in chemotherapy-injured heart muscle.19-21 Glutamine can enhance intracellular repletion of glutathione, an important scavenger of reactive oxygen species.22 Rat studies demonstrated that during 5-fluorouracil–induced free radical– mediated hepatic injury, glutamine increased glutathione biosynthesis and preserved the glutathione stores in hepatic tissue.19 A more recent study found that glutamine protected porcine enterocytes from cell death from oxidative damage by regulating glutathione synthesis.23 The promise of these in vitro and animal studies has also been verified by human studies. Seventeen patients who underwent a stan- dardized surgical procedure were prospectively given 0.56 g/kg body weight/day of glutamine or a placebo. Using percutaneous muscle biopsies and blood samples, there were no significant decreases in total or reduced glutathione in the glutamine-supplemented group 24 and 72 hours after the operation. In contrast, the placebo group experi- enced total muscle glutathione losses of 47 ± 8% and 37 ± 11%, as well as reduced glutathione decreases of 53 ± 10% and 45 ± 16% at 24 and 72 hours, respectively. An in vivo study of 12 HIV+ patients found that daily supplementation of high-dose glutamine (20 g/day) increased plasma measurements of GSH; this same study also found that N-acetylcysteine was effective at increasing GSH levels.24

## Protein Sparing

Glutamine is a regulator of muscle proteolysis,25 and supplementation can attenuate loss of protein in the muscle.

## Immune Support

Although poorly understood, it appears that glutamine has an immune-modulating effect by enhancing interleukin (IL)-6 levels27 and lymphocyte function.28 IL-6 plays an essential role in the final differen- tiation of β -cells into immunoglobulin-secreting cells, nerve cell differ- entiation, and acute phase reactants in hepatocytes. Exercise by itself is known to induce an elevenfold increase in plasma IL-6. Glutamine supplementation further enhances IL-6 levels.27 The ability of lym- phocytes to proliferate and generate lymphokine-activated killer cell activity in vitro was found to be glutamine dependent.29 Additionally, glutamine-enriched parenteral nutrition demonstrated enhanced lym- phocyte activity in patients who received high doses of chemotherapy after stem cell transplantation for hematologous malignancy.

## Intestinal Permeability–Related Conditions

A number of conditions are linked to intestinal permeabilities, includ- ing chronic urticaria,30 inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s dis- ease),31-33 celiac disease,34 liver and biliary cirrhosis and cases of portal hypertension,35,36 systemic sclerosis,37 diabetes,38 rheumatologic disor- ders,39,40 cystic fibrosis,41 alcohol overuse,42 adult and child asthma,43 HIV/AIDS,44 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–treated arthritis patients,45 moderate to major burn injuries,46 corticosteroid use,47 cardiopulmonary bypass patients,48,49 and acute metal toxicities.50 To evaluate these permeabilities, sucrose serves as a marker for gas- troduodenal permeability and the urinary lactulose/mannitol ratio for intestinal permeability, after administration of these sugars.30 From a naturopathic perspective, the underlying cause of many of these con- ditions may stem from food allergies that contribute first to chronic inflammation in the intestinal tract30 and then to systemic endotox- emia. Certain conditions such as cardiopulmonary bypass can cause intestinal ischemia,51 which is then the primary insult that causes per- meabilities in these patients. The use of glutamine can help heal these permeabilities, thus removing a mode of pathogenesis in these varie- gated conditions.

## Infectious Diarrhea

Animal models showed the usefulness of glutamine in diarrhea to aug- ment sodium and water absorption and to enhance blood glucose and body weight.52 A rat model of cholera toxin–induced diarrhea showed that glutamine was able to improve water and electrolyte intesti- nal absorption even better than traditional glucose solutions.10 One placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial human study eval- uated glutamine to treat acute diarrhea in 128 otherwise healthy chil- dren. Of these 6- to 24-month-olds, 63 received 0.3 g/kg per day of glutamine and 65 controls received a placebo for 7 days. The average duration of diarrhea in the glutamine-treated group was significantly shorter than that of the placebo group (3.40 ± 1.96 vs 4.57 ± 2.48 days, respectively). However, no differences in serum IL-8 and secretory immunoglobulin-A were found between groups at the beginning of treatment or 1 week later.53 Clearly, glutamine holds promise for enhancing repair of mucosal injury caused by a wide range of infections or toxic agents and thus has great potential as a nutritional therapeutic for patients with enteric infection.54

## Postsurgical Complications of the Gastrointestinal Tract

Patients undergoing abdominal surgeries such as gastrectomies, sig- moidectomies, cholecystectomies, colectomies, and rectal resections are at risk for the development of intestinal failure or short bowel syn- drome (SBS). In SBS, a serious malabsorption of fluid, electrolytes, and other nutrients can occur, placing the patient at higher morbidity and mortality risk.55 Trauma from abdominal surgery may also compro- mise the intestinal mucosa to the point where bacteria and endotoxins can easily transfer through the intestinal wall and invade tissue and blood in an event called bacterial translocation. Through inflammatory mechanisms, bacteria, and endotoxic septic conditions, the intestinal mucosal barrier can be adversely affected and cause further damage, thus forming a vicious circle. Severe cases result in systemic inflamma- tory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.56 In a regimen that includes growth hormone and diet changes, glu- tamine can help difficult cases to enhance bowel adaptation. In one study of 10 patients with SBS who previously failed to adapt to enteral nutrients, 8 subjects received exogenous growth hormone, supple- mental glutamine, and a modified high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet. Two patients were treated with the modified diet alone. Three weeks of treatment with growth hormone, glutamine, and a modified diet significantly increased total caloric absorption from approximately 60% to 75%, protein absorption from 49% to 63%, and carbohydrate absorption from 60% to 82%. Water absorption increased from 46% to 65%, and sodium from 49% to 69%. Fat absorption did not change. Diet alone did not influence nutrient absorption or stool output. After 28 days of therapy, the patients were discharged and instructed to con- tinue the diet and glutamine treatment.57 It is unknown whether glu- tamine and diet changes alone, without concomitant growth hormone administration, would have the same positive effect. In a second study, 20 patients who underwent abdominal surgery were randomized into two groups receiving oral administration of 30 g of glutamine or a placebo in divided doses for 7 days. Serum glu- tamine concentration was significantly decreased in the placebo group and increased in the glutamine group after 7 days. Markers of intesti- nal permeability were significantly increased in the placebo group and decreased in the glutamine group. Additionally, the serum markers of endotoxin, diamine oxidase, and malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly decreased in the glutamine group compared with those in the placebo group. Temperatures, heart rates, and white blood cell counts were also significantly lower in the glutamine group.56 Ischemia reperfusion of the gut is also a common event in various clinical conditions, such as trauma, burn, septic shock, cardiac or aor- tic surgery, and liver or small bowel transplantation, and is associated with a high death rate. Intestinal ischemia reperfusion can cause edema and disruption of the structural integrity and function of the intestinal mucosa and associated vascular tissue. It may set the stage for endo- toxemic translocation of a number of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and Staphylococcus.

and functional mucosal injury after intestinal ischemia reperfusion. Furthermore, intestinal permeabilities and the incidence of bacterial translocation in intestinal ischemia reperfusion animals were also pre- vented in a dose-dependent manner by glutamine supplementation.58,59 The gastrointestinal tract is susceptible to SBS, severe intestinal permeabilities, ischemia perfusion damage, systemic inflammatory response during trauma, various medical conditions, and abdominal postoperative periods. Glutamine can decrease intestinal permeability, maintain an intestinal barrier, and attenuate systemic inflammatory response in early postoperative patients.

## Chemotherapy and Radiation Side Effects

Standard cancer therapies often include the use of chemotherapy and radiation, which can injure rapidly dividing intestinal cells. It was shown that during chemotherapeutic and radiotherapy insult, glu- tamine reduced degeneration of intestinal mucosa in rats, prevented intestinal mucosal injury,58 protected liver function through enhanced glutathione biosynthesis and storage in hepatic tissue, increased immune function, and reduced permeability of the gut.19,28 In one investigation, 70 patients with colorectal cancer were ran- domly assigned to oral glutamine at 18 g/day or placebo before the first regimen of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid administered intravenously for 5 days. Glutamine was given 5 days before, during, and after che- motherapy. Using d-xylose urinary excretion and cellobiose/manni- tol evaluation, damage to the intestines was assessed at baseline, and 4 and 5 days after the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy. After one cycle of chemotherapy, the reduction in d-xylose absorption and reduction of mannitol was significantly greater in the placebo group (7.1% vs. 3.8% and 9.2% vs. 4.5%, respectively). Urinary recovery of cellobiose was not different between the study arms. Accordingly, the cellobiose/mannitol ratio increased more in the placebo treatment group. Furthermore, diarrhea parameters, and the average number of antidiarrheal opiate loperamide tablets needed, were reduced in the glutamine arm, thus supporting the positive clinical effect of this low- cost supplement.11 Oropharyngeal mucositis, or mouth sores, and accompanying swallowing difficulty are other untoward results of radiotherapy and can be a major source of suffering in patients with head and neck cancer. Glutamine during and after chemotherapy appears to be an excellent way to safely decrease the incidence of mouth sores. One investigation of 17 patients with head and neck cancer who received primary or adjuvant mouth irradiation for 5 days a week were ran- domized to either adjunctive glutamine suspension of 16 g in 240 mL normal saline or a saline placebo. Patients were instructed to swish the test solutions (30 mL) four times daily. The duration of objective oral mucositis was significantly shorter in the glutamine arm.60 A second randomized, double-blind crossover trial observed 24 patients who were given a glutamine or placebo suspension to swish and swallow on days of chemotherapy administration and for at least 14 days after therapy. Significant improvement was observed in the glutamine group. Additionally, the duration of mouth pain was 4.5 days less in chemotherapy courses with concomitant glutamine supplementation. The severity of oral pain was reduced so significantly when glutamine was used that a patient could venture past soft foods 4 days sooner compared with placebo.61 Glutamine studies validating its use are also beginning to emerge in other areas of oncology. In a study of esophageal cancer patients, 13 patients were randomized into two groups, controls and a group that received oral glutamine supplemented at a dosage of 30 g/day for 4 weeks. It was observed that supplementation of glutamine enhanced lymphocyte mitogenic function and reduced permeability of the gut during radiochemotherapy.5 Patients who underwent bone marrow transplant and myelosuppressive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia also found that parenteral glutamine therapy could improve neutrophil recovery, although no change in neutropenic fever was shown.62 Given that glutamine improves the structure and function of the gut, it is understandable that multiple parameters and markers of healthy physiological function will improve with its use. It should be noted that glutamine’s efficacy may depend on a number of other factors, including the specific chemotherapeutic pre- scribed and dosage. A study of 65 patients with advanced breast can- cer receiving doxifluridine were prescribed 30 g/day of glutamine in three divided doses of 10 g each or a placebo for 8 consecutive days during each interval between chemotherapy, which was administered from days 1 to 4. In this case there was no statistical difference with regard to diarrhea morbidity, nor did glutamine affect the severity and duration of tumor growth.63 Interestingly, a study of bone marrow transplantation patients found that allogeneic transplantation patients (those receiving bone marrow from another individual) did not have the same beneficial mouth pain reduction that autologous transplan- tation patients (those who donated their own marrow) experienced when receiving glutamine support. However, in the work mentioned previously, the amounts of glutamine were less than those used in other studies. It was also theorized that methotrexate use in the allogeneic patients might have been responsible for the decreased protection. Nevertheless, in the allogeneic patients, the 28-day survival was still increased.64 A third multicenter study of 129 patients found no pro- tection against diarrhea when used adjunctively with pelvic radiation therapy. These patients received 4 g of glutamine or a placebo by mouth, which was also a significantly lower dose than the more suc- cessful studies employed.65 Although intestinal function is greatly compromised with che- motherapy and radiation treatment, cardiac function is commonly affected as well. The use of doxorubicin therapy for breast cancer is often limited by cardiomyopathic heart changes that often result in congestive heart failure. One rat study simulated doxorubicin treat- ment with and without glutamine support and found that oxidative damage to the heart was diminished in the glutamine-treated group, probably as a result of glutamine’s ability to maintain cardiac tissue glutathione levels (see later discussion on “Cardiac Disease”).21

## Cachexia

Cancer-related cachexia is caused by a diverse combination of accel- erated protein breakdown and slowed protein synthesis.66 There has been considerable interest in giving supplemental glutamine to can- cer patients because glutamine is taken up by the growing tumor, and any subsequent deficiency of glutamine in the host may cause cancer cachexia.5 One animal study found that glutamine levels in plasma and skel- etal muscle were decreased in tumor-bearing rats, whereas gluta- mine production and the conversion of arginine to glutamine were increased. In rats supplemented with glutamine, total parenteral nutrition demonstrated a reduced whole body protein breakdown rate during chemotherapy.5 A clinical study of patients with stage IV solid malignancies who had weight loss of at least 5% randomly assigned the participants in a double-blind fashion to either a control mixture of nonessential amino acids or treatment of 14 g/day of glutamine, along with the leucine metabolite β -hydroxy- β -methylbutyrate (3 g/day) and l-arginine (14 g/day). Within 4 weeks, the patients supplemented with the glutamine mixture gained 0.95 ± 0.66 kg of body mass, whereas control subjects lost 0.26 ± 0.78 kg during the same period. This effect continued over the 24 weeks, with no negative effect of treatment on the incidence of adverse effects or quality of life measures.66

## 638SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Because the glutamine derived from skeletal muscle is trapped by the tumor, there is a theoretical concern that glutamine supplemen- tation in cancer patients could potentially encourage tumor growth. One research group, however, showed that glutamine supplemen- tation does not appear to enhance DNA content in tumor cells.5,67 Additionally, some tissue culture studies provided evidence that glu- tamine might even inhibit cancer promotion.68 Although research is necessary to clarify this point, given the immediate risk of mortality due to protein loss in cancer patients, it still would seem prudent to administer glutamine to those patients at greater immediate risk of cachexia-related death.

## Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Loss of body cell mass and drug-associated gastrointestinal problems often occur in patients with HIV infection. In these cases, the patient’s ability to survive can be affected in the long term. Given the role glutamine plays in cachexic body mass loss (see previous section on “Cachexia”), reversal of malabsorption,69 and protection of the small intestine,70 glutamine deficiency is a probable causal factor in HIV- associated wasting.71 Preliminary clinical studies suggested improvements in HIV- positive patients dosed at 8 g/day with regard to intestinal permeability and intestinal absorption. The authors of this study correctly suggested that at least 20 g/day might be necessary for more significant improve- ments.72 A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 26 patients with greater than 5% weight loss since their disease onset used a glutamine and antioxidant regimen, including 40 g/day of glutamine in divided doses or 40 g of a glycine placebo for 12 weeks. Over 3 months, the glutamine/antioxidant group gained 2.2 kg in body weight (3.2%), whereas the control group gained only 0.3 kg (0.4%). The glutamine-antioxidant group gained 1.8 kg in body cell mass, whereas the control group gained 0.4 kg. Of note, the intracellular water increased in the glutamine-antioxidant group but not in the con- trol group.73 Glutamine can help HIV patients decrease the severity of iatrogenic diarrhea. Twenty-five patients suffering for more than a month from nelfinavir-associated diarrhea were randomized in a dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to receive l-glutamine at 30 g/day or a placebo for 10 days. In this study, the l-glutamine significantly reduced the severity of nelfinavir-associated diarrhea and produced improved quality of life compared with placebo.74

## Peptic Ulcers

Cabbage juice, a key source of glutamine, has been well documented as having remarkable success in treating peptic ulcers. One liter per day of the fresh juice, taken in divided doses, resulted in total ulcer healing in an average of only 10 days. Further research showed that the high glutamine content of the juice is probably responsible for the efficacy of cabbage in treating these ulcers. In a double-blind clinical study of 57 patients, 24 using 1.6 g/day of glutamine and the rest using conventional therapy (antacids, antispasmodics, milk, and bland diet), glutamine proved to be the more effective treatment. Half of the glu- tamine patients showed complete healing (according to radiographic analysis) within 2 weeks, and 22 of the 24 showed complete relief and healing within 4 weeks.101 Although the mechanism for these results is unknown, it was postulated by the authors to be due to the role of glu- tamine in the biosynthesis of the hexosamine moiety in certain muco- proteins. These moieties may stimulate mucin synthesis, which would benefit peptic ulcer patients.

## Severe Burns

Plasma glutamine levels were demonstrated to be profoundly decreased after severe burns in adults. This may at least partially explain the impaired cellular immunity that is seen in burn patients. Burn victims given glutamine showed better intestinal repair, a higher quality of wound healing, and reduced hospitalization. In one study, 48 severe burn patients were randomly divided into two groups: a control group that took a placebo, and a glutamine-treated group that received 0.5 g of glutamine/kg body weight/day, both for 14 days. After taking glu- tamine for 14 days, plasma glutamine concentration was significantly increased in the glutamine group compared with the control group. In addition, a greater quality of wound healing as well as shorter hospital stays were experienced in the glutamine-treated burn patients.75 In another study, dosage of l-glutamine at 0.6 g/kg per day did not result in an immediate whole body protein gain (an important fac- tor in a burn patient’s convalescence) and resulted in an insignificant increase in plasma glutamine.4 However, this study measured only the first 48 hours, which might not have been enough time to show a long- term benefit. Another study of 45 severely burned adults found that those ran- domized to receive enteral glutamine experienced a reduction in blood infection by a factor of three, and mortality risk was lowered.76 Another investigation of burned patients whose total body surface burns ranged from 50% to 80% and third-degree burns ranged from 20% to 40%, but who did not have respiratory injuries, found improved gut per- meability, initially decreased plasma endotoxin levels, and reduced hospitalization.77

## Low-Birth-Weight Infants

Infants with a birth weight of less than 1000 to 1500 g may be especially susceptible to glutamine depletion, as nutritional supply of glutamine is limited in the first weeks after birth. This may increase morbidity by contributing to problems with gut integrity, as well as immune suppression.3 One study of 35 ill preterm neonates of less than 1000 g were randomized to receive either glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition or standard parenteral nutrition. Although there were no sig- nificant differences between the groups in white cell count, differential white cell count, blood urea nitrogen, plasma ammonia, lactate, pyru- vate, plasma glutamine, or glutamate, the median time to achieving full enteral nutrition was shorter in the glutamine group (13 vs. 21 days). Parenteral glutamine was well tolerated and considered safe for these preterm neonates.78 However, other studies found that formula supplemented with glutamine in growing preterm infants was entirely metabolized in the gut and did not have a discernable effect on whole-body protein and nitrogen kinetics.79 A large multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of infants with a birth weight of 401 to 1000 g were given either a control or 20% isonitrogenous solution by parenteral nutrition for up to either 120 days of age, death, or discharge from the hospital. Of the 721 infants who were assigned to glutamine supplementation, 370 (51%) died or developed late-onset sepsis, compared with 343 of the 712 infants (48%) assigned to control. Although no adverse effects were noted as a result of being given glutamine, this study demon- strated that glutamine did not decrease mortality. This study and oth- ers also found no reduction in the incidence of sepsis in these young patients.80,81

## Exercise and Weight Lifting

Glutamine is considered to have an anabolic effect on skeletal mus- cle. Given the benefits on glutathione reserves, protein catabolism, and intestinal integrity, some glutamine enthusiasts believe that glu- tamine supplementation may be useful for exercise and strength train- ing as well (Fig. 84.4). One small study suggested that oral glutamine increases growth hormone release.15 Even so, clinical trials studying glutamine as an exercise performance enhancer are not encouraging.

## 639CHAPTER 84 Glutamine

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study had 6 resis- tance-trained men lift weights after the ingestion of glutamine or gly- cine at 0.3 g/kg body weight or a placebo. One hour after ingestion, subjects performed four total sets of exercise to momentary muscu- lar failure, including two sets of leg presses at 200% of body weight and two sets of bench presses at 100% of body weight. Despite glu- tamine’s possible role in exercise, there were no actual differences in the average number of maximal repetitions performed in the leg press or bench press exercises among these three groups.82 Other studies using 0.3 to 0.9 g/kg of body weight also demonstrated no changes in exercise performance, body composition, or muscle protein degrada- tion in young healthy adults.83,84 It is possible that beneficial effects of glutamine are best detected only in patients with chronic illness and those with compromised physiology instead of normal, healthy individuals.

## Cardiac Disease

Cardiac disease is a recognized stress on the physiology of the gas- trointestinal and immune system. Animal studies supported the notion that glutamine can help recovery from cardiac ischemia and help the heart recover after reperfusion injury.85,86 As noted earlier, glutamine can protect the heart from damage due to che- motherapy regimens by its glutathione-replenishing effect (see ear- lier discussion on “Chemotherapy and Radiation Side Effects”).19 The benefits to the gastrointestinal system in those heart patients experiencing ischemic gut episodes after cardiac bypass were also previously noted.48,49 Animal research showed that greater levels of plasma glutamine also prevented decreases in the ratio between adenosine triphosphate to adenosine diphosphate in myocardial tissue.86 Unfortunately, little research has been done to evaluate the clini- cal use of glutamine in various cardiac situations. One investigation of patients with chronic stable angina received a single 80 mg/kg oral dose of glutamine or a placebo in a double-blind, random fashion minutes before a standard exercise test. This single dose of glutamine significantly increased plasma glutamine concentration from 419 to 649 μ mol/L. Moreover, the glutamine appeared to encourage posi- tive changes in ST depression on the echocardiogram.86 Clearly, more research is required, but given that heart disease is the leading reason for mortality, natural and safe treatments like glutamine should be fur- ther explored.

## Crohn’s Disease

The effect of glutamine on Crohn’s disease might be expected to be positive, given its role as a nutrient source for enterocytes. However, studies have been mixed. One study failed to show an effect from a 4-week course of a glutamine-enriched diet in the treatment of active Crohn’s disease.87 Another failed to show an effect on small intestine permeability after long-term supplementation of 21 g/day of gluta- mine; patients were screened for plasma glutamine, plasma gluta- mate, plasma ammonium, Crohn’s disease activity index, C-reactive protein, and nutritional status.88 However, a more recent study found that glutamine did improve intestinal permeability and morphology in patients with Crohn’s disease. Patients were administered 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months and had significant improvements in permeability, as measured by lactulose mannitol excretion, and in morphology.89 This study also included an active control group who were administered whey protein, and also experienced improvements in permeability and morphology. A review of the available literature available until November 2015 determined that there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy or safety of glutamine in Crohn’s disease.90 The role of glutamine in Crohn’s disease thus remains unresolved.

## Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is a complex condition in which increased oxidative stress causes deformation of the red blood cell protein hemoglobin, which then causes deformation of red blood cells themselves. These deformed cells are then prone to hemolysis by the spleen, causing the well-known anemia, as well as obstruction of capillaries, causing pain, necrosis, and organ damage. Starting in the 1990s, it had been observed that glutamine improved NAD redox potential and NADH levels in sickled RBCs, and that these changes might decrease oxidative suscep- tibility of red blood cells in the disease.91 Later research also found that oral administration of 30 g of glutamine per day for at least 4 weeks decreased adhesion of sickle RBCs to endothelial cells.92 More recently, a drug consisting only of l-glutamine has been approved to treat sickle cell anemia.

## Other Conditions

A number of other medical conditions, such as alcoholism, pancreati- tis, and brain injury, will further adversely affect the health of a patient who already has protein and energy needs and is more susceptible to infection. Although more studies are necessary, the following includes a few interesting conditions not mentioned earlier. In alcoholics, glutamine supplementation (1 g/day) was shown to reduce voluntary alcohol consumption in uncontrolled human stud- ies and experimental animal studies.93-96 Despite the fact that this research is about 50 years old, there has never been any follow-up to these preliminary studies. This is unfortunate, because the results were quite promising, finding glutamine to be safe and relatively inexpen- sive. Related to alcoholism in many patients, individuals with acute pancreatitis also benefited from parenteral glutamine treatment with improvement in immune function, decreased systemic inflammation, and a trend toward shorter hospital stays.1 In an interesting study of 20 brain injury patients, 10 subjects were randomized to receive either an early enteral diet or the same formula with glutamine and probiotic added for a range of 5 to 14 days. The infection rate was found to be 100% in the control group, but only 50% in the glutamine group. The median number of infections per patient was significantly greater in the control group compared with the study group. Critical care stay and ventilation requirements were more than halved in the treatment group (10 vs. 22 days, and 14 vs. Glutamic acidGlutathioneCystine Glucose Polyamines Creatine Urea Arginine Hydroxyproline ProlineOrnithine Glutathione Glutamine Glutaminase y-Amino butyric acid α-Ketoglutarate Glutamate NeucleotidesGABA Folate polyglutamates Glycoproteins Tryptophan Aminosugars Histadine NAD+

days, respectively). Interestingly, probiotics were also used in the treat- ment group. This synergistic enhancement in gut flora may be useful to augment the already known benefits of glutamine.97


The typical minimum oral dosage of glutamine is 100 mg three times a day, although the delivery method and actual effective dosage should be condition specific, meaning dosages are often much higher. The fol- lowing points serve as guidelines: • Severe burns: enteral dosage for individuals with severe burns was approximately 0.5 g/kg per day in most studies. • Preventing and treating the side effects of chemotherapy involves the following: • Patients treated with 5-fluorouracil received up to 18 g/day 5 days before, then during, and 5 days after treatment.11 • High-dose chemotherapy after stem cell transplantation: total par- enteral nutrition enriched with glutamine 20 g.28 • Oral mucositis: 16 g mixed with 240 mL normal saline, and 30 mL is swished four times a day.60 • Esophageal cancer radiotherapy was given with a successful adjunc- tive oral glutamine supplement of 30 g/day for 4 weeks.5 • Cachexia patients were tested with dosages of 14 g/day combined with other amino acids.66 • Pediatric oncology patients: 0.65 g/kg was found to be a safe dose of glutamine to use in a clinical study in pediatric oncology patients.98 • Children with acute diarrhea: 0.3 g/kg per day was used success- fully.53 • Peptic ulcers: drinking 1 L a day in divided doses was sufficient or 1.6 g/day for 1 month.101 • HIV patients: 30 to 40 g/day of glutamine to prevent medication-as- sociated diarrhea and to improve intestinal permeability73,74; coad- ministration of antioxidants might also be helpful. • Postabdominal surgeries: glutamine can be dissolved in warm water and taken orally or by gastric tube after the operation at 30 g/ day for 7 days.56


Glutamine, even at high doses, is without apparent side effects and is well tolerated.4,54 Glutamine is synthesized from glutamate and the toxic alkaline waste product ammonia. If the blood is too acidic, the glutamine can be broken down into glutamate and ammonia, which will increase blood pH. Glutamate levels in the blood can increase slightly with high doses of supplemental glutamine administration (around 15 g in a single dose), but not with moderate doses (of about 5 g in a single dose). The higher doses may contribute to glutamate levels, and should be used with caution in patients with neurodegen- erative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple scle- rosis.99 In one pediatric oncology patient, a single dose of 0.75/kg was found to raise the blood ammonia level to an unacceptably high limit. Related to this, it was difficult to disperse the glutamine adequately at this dose, resulting in the suspension being found unpalatable.


In cancer treatment, glutamine does not appear to change the effi- cacy of cancer drugs, rate of relapse, or progression of malignancy.64 Some animal studies suggested that glutamine supplementation might even preferentially increase tumor retention of methotrexate, thus increasing the therapeutic window of this drug.100 Many antisei- zure medications, including phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamaze- pine, primidone, and valproic acid, work to block glutamate activity in the brain. Because glutamine can convert to glutamate, clinicians should be cautious when using glutamine in patients using these medications.

Most herbalists generally believe that glycyrrhiza exhibits alterative action on estrogen metabolism (i.e., when estrogen levels are too high, it inhibits estrogen action, and when estrogens are too low, it poten- tiates estrogen action when used in greater amounts).4 Glycyrrhetinic acid has been shown to antagonize many of the effects of estrogens, particularly exogenous estrogens.5 The estrogenic action of glycyrrhiza is a result of its isoflavone content, as many isoflavone structures (e.g., daidzein and genistein from soy) are known to possess estrogenic effect. The estrogenic activity of the isoflavones appears to be more significant than the estrogen antagonism of glycyrrhetinic acid.6 Interestingly, these same components inhibit breast cancer cell growth.7

## Pseudoaldosterone Activity

Long-term ingestion of glycyrrhiza in large doses leads to a well- documented pseudoaldosteronism syndrome (i.e., hypertension, hypo- kalemia, sodium and water retention, low plasma renin activity, and sup- pressed urine and serum aldosterone levels).8-13 In normal subjects, the amount of glycyrrhizin needed to produce these side effects is between 0.7 and 1.4 g, which corresponds to approximately 10 to 14 g of the crude herb.9 Although glycyrrhiza possesses mineralocorticoid activity (about four orders of magnitude lower than aldosterone) and binds to aldoste- rone receptors, it is largely without effect in adrenalectomized animals or in patients with severe adrenocorticoid insufficiency. Therefore it can be concluded that its primary effects are largely a result of glycyrrhetinic acid inhibiting the breakdown of aldosterone in the liver.14 Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid were shown to suppress 5- β -reductase, the main enzyme in humans responsible for inactivating cortisol, aldosterone, and progesterone. These effects can be put to good use in the treatment of Addison’s disease, a severe disease of adrenal insufficiency.13

## Anti-Inflammatory and Antiallergic Activity

Glycyrrhiza has significant anti-inflammatory and antialler- gic activity.15,16 Although both glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid bind to glucocorticoid receptors, and much of glycyrrhiza’s anti-inflammatory activity has been explained by its “cortisol-like effects,” many of the effects of glycyrrhiza actually antagonize or counteract cortisol.17 Antagonism to such actions of cortisol includes activation of tryptophan oxygenase, accumulation of hepatic glycogen, stimulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis, inhi- bition of thymus atrophy, and inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone synthesis and secretion. Glycyrrhizin does, however, reinforce cortisol’s inhibition of antibody formation, stress reac- tion, and inflammation. Like its mineralocorticoid effect, glycyr- rhiza’s major influence on glucocorticoid metabolism is probably related to its suppression of 5- β -reductase activity, thus increasing the half-life of cortisol. Glycyrrhetinic acid can also increase the conversion of cortisol to the more powerful cortisone.18 Glycyrrhiza’s major cortisol-like effect relates to its ability to inhibit phospholipase A 2 .19 This enzyme is responsible for cleaving lipids from biomembranes for eicosanoid metabolism. In addition to this effect, glycyrrhizin was also shown to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophos- phate phosphodiesterase, thereby raising cyclic adenosine mono- phosphate levels and prostaglandin formation by activated peritoneal macrophages from rats.20,21 Glycyrrhizin was shown to inhibit exper- imentally induced allergenic reactions, such as the Arthus phenome- non, the Shwartzman phenomenon, and Forssman anaphylaxis, and

## Immunostimulatory and Antiviral Effects

Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid were shown to induce inter- feron.24 The induction of interferon leads to significant antiviral activity, because interferons bind to cell surfaces, where they stimu- late synthesis of intracellular proteins that block the transcription of viral DNA. The induction of interferon is also followed by activation of macrophages and augmentation of natural killer cell activity. Glycyrrhizin was shown to directly inhibit the growth of several DNA and RNA viruses in cell cultures (vaccinia, Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex, Newcastle disease, vesicular stomatitis viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-associated coronavirus, and HIV) and to inactivate herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) irreversibly.25-28 Administration of gly- cyrrhizin to mice with herpetic encephalitis increased their survival rate on average about 2.5 times, whereas it reduced HSV-1 replication in the brain to 45.6% of the controls.29 Glycyrrhizin, as stated earlier, also inhibited the thymolytic and immunosuppressive action of cortisone. Other licorice components exerted immunomodulatory effects as well.30

## Anticancer Effects

Licorice components exert a wide range of anticancer effects.31 The most active appear to be the flavonoids and coumarins. For exam- ple, isoliquiritigenin was shown to suppress colon cancer in mice via markedly decreasing both prostaglandin E 2 and nitric oxide produc- tion in mouse macrophage cells.32 Isoliquiritigenin was also shown to significantly inhibit the proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cell lines in dose- and time-dependent manners.7,33 Isoliquiritigenin also significantly reduced pulmonary metastasis in mouse renal cell carci- noma and prevented the leukocytopenia caused by administration of 5-fluorouracil.34 A coumarin compound, identified as licocoumarone, was shown to be the factor in licorice that induces apoptosis.35

## Antibacterial Activity

Alcohol extracts of glycyrrhiza displayed antimicrobial activity in vitro against Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus (including antibi- otic resistant strains), Streptococcus mutans, Mycobacterium smegma- tis, Bacillus subtilis, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Candida albicans.36-39 The majority of the antimicro- bial effects are due to isoflavonoid components, with the saponins hav- ing a lesser antibacterial effect.

## Antihepatotoxic Activity

Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits carbon tetrachloride and galactosamine- induced liver damage. The mechanism of action is prevention of non- enzymatic lipid peroxidation and inhibition of the production of free radicals by the enzymatic action of nicotine adenine disphosphonucle- otide, reduced–cytochrome P450 reductase on CCl4.40

## Memory-Enhancing Effect

Licorice may exert some memory-enhancing effects. In a study in mice, licorice was shown to enhance learning and memory in mice as deter- mined by the elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance paradigm. Furthermore, licorice significantly reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam and scopolamine. Although anti-inflammatory and antiox- idant properties may contribute favorably to the memory-enhancing effect, because scopolamine-induced amnesia was reversed as well, it is possible that the beneficial effect on learning and memory was a result of facilitation of cholinergic transmission.41

## Antinephritic Activity

Glabridin, an isoflavan isolated from G. glabra, improved urinary protein excretion, total cholesterol, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels after its oral administration to mice with glomerular disease.42


Licorice is a component of more traditional Chinese and Japanese herbal formulas than any other herb and has been commonly used in Western natural medicine and herbalism for centuries. Although extremely pharmacologically diverse, the current clinical applications of licorice can be divided into four main categories: • Use of DGL • Use of oral licorice preparations containing glycyrrhizin • Use of licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) • Use of topical preparations containing glycyrrhetinic acid The key use of DGL is in ulcerative conditions of the gastrointesti- nal tract (e.g., peptic ulcers, canker sores, inflammatory bowel disease), whereas the key uses of oral licorice containing glycyrrhizin include viral infections (e.g., the common cold, HIV and AIDS, viral hepati- tis); premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menopause; acute intermit- tent porphyria; Addison’s disease; inflammation; syndrome X; and as a sweetening agent. Topical preparations containing glycyrrhetinic acid can be used in eczema, psoriasis, herpes, and melasma.

# DEGLYCYRRHIZINATED LICORICE

Although glycyrrhetinic acid was the first drug proven to promote healing of gastric and duodenal ulcers,43 most physicians using lic- orice in the treatment of peptic ulcers now use DGL. DGL was actu- ally shown to be more effective than glycyrrhetinic acid, without side effects.44 DGL’s mode of action is different than that of current drugs, such as antacids and H 2 -receptor antagonists, which focus on reducing gastric acidity. Although effective, these treatments can be expensive, carry some risk of toxicity, disrupt normal digestive processes, and alter the structure and function of the cells that line the digestive tract. The latter factor is just one of the reasons why peptic ulcers develop again if antacids, cimetidine, ranitidine, and similar drugs are used. Rather than inhibit the release of acid, DGL stimulates the normal defense mechanisms that prevent ulcer formation and stimulate heal- ing of the damaged mucous membranes. Specifically, DGL increases the following45,46: • The blood supply to the damaged mucosa • The number of cells producing the mucus that protects the mucous membranes • The amount of mucus the cells produce • The life span of the intestinal cell In addition, several flavonoid components of G. glabra have shown significant activity against H. pylori, including antibiotic-resistant strains.38 To evaluate the effect of licorice in H. pylori eradication in 120 patients suffering from dyspepsia either with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD), licorice (380 mg twice daily) was given in addition to clarithromycin-based standard triple regimen for 2 weeks.47 H. pylori eradication was assessed 6 weeks after therapy. Response to treatment was 83.3% in the licorice group and 62.5% in the control group.

## Gastric Ulcers

Numerous clinical studies over the years found DGL to be an effective antiulcer compound. DGL was shown to be extremely effective in the

treatment of gastric ulcers.48-52 In one study, 33 gastric ulcer patients were treated with either DGL (760 mg, three times a day) or a placebo for 1 month.50 There was a significantly greater reduction in ulcer size in the DGL group (78%) than in the placebo group (34%). Complete healing occurred in 44% of those receiving DGL but only in 6% of the placebo group. In several head-to-head comparison studies, DGL was shown to be more effective than cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac), or antacids in both short-term treatment and maintenance therapy of peptic ulcers.48,49,52 For example, in a head-to-head comparison with Tagamet, 100 patients received either DGL (760 mg, three times a day between meals) or Tagamet (200 mg, three times a day, and 400 mg at bedtime).49 The percentage of ulcers healed after 6 and 12 weeks were similar in both groups. Although Tagamet is associated with some sig- nificant side effects, DGL is extremely safe to use. Gastric ulcers are often a result of using alcohol, aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, caffeine, and other factors that decrease the integrity of the gastric lining. Because DGL was shown in human studies to reduce the gastric bleeding caused by aspirin, DGL is strongly indicated for the prevention of gastric ulcers in patients requiring long-term treatment with ulcerogenic drugs such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and corticosteroids.51

## Duodenal Ulcers

DGL is also effective in duodenal ulcers. This is perhaps best illustrated by one study in patients with severe duodenal ulcers: 40 patients with chronic duodenal ulcers of 4 to 12 years’ duration and more than six relapses during the previous year were treated with DGL.53 All of the patients had been referred for surgery because of relentless pain, some- times with frequent vomiting, despite treatment with bed rest, antac- ids, and anticholinergic drugs. Half of the patients received 3 g/day of DGL for 8 weeks; the other half received 4.5 g/day for 16 weeks. All patients showed substantial improvement, usually within 5 to 7 days, and none required surgery during the 1-year follow-up. Although both dosages were effective, the higher dosage was significantly more effec- tive than the lower dosage. In another more recent study, the therapeutic effect of DGL was compared with that of antacids or cimetidine in 874 patients with confirmed chronic duodenal ulcers.52 Ninety-one percent of all ulcers healed within 12 weeks; there was no significant difference in healing rate in the groups. However, there were fewer relapses in the DGL group (8.2%) than in those receiving cimetidine (12.9%) or antacids (16.4%). These results, coupled with DGL’s protective effects and very low toxicity, suggest that DGL is a superior treatment of duodenal ulcers.

## Aphthous Ulcers

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is a common problem. DGL may be effective in promoting healing. In one study, 20 patients were instructed to use a solution of DGL as a mouthwash (200 mg powdered DGL dissolved in 200 mL warm water) four times daily.54 Fifteen of the 20 (75%) patients experienced 50% to 75% improve- ment within 1 day, followed by complete healing of the ulcers by the third day. DGL in tablet form may produce even better results.

# ORAL LICORICE PREPARATIONS CONTAINING

# GLYCYRRHIZIN

The most popular use of oral licorice preparations containing glycyr- rhizin is in the treatment of viral illnesses, particularly the common cold. Licorice has long been used in this application. This historical use is justified by its immune-enhancing and antiviral effects. In addition, licorice components were shown to exert antibacterial action against the common pathogens S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.55 Another popular use of licorice is in the treatment of gynecolog- ical issues, primarily PMS and menopause. Regarding PMS, because glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid possess antiestrogenic effects and suppress the breakdown of progesterone, administration of licorice 2 weeks before the onset of menstruation (the midluteal phase) may help reduce PMS symptomatology. Clinical trials showed that taking licorice containing herbal combinations was useful in dysmenorrhea.56 Isoflavones from glycyrrhiza showed an ability to inhibit serotonin reuptake, and therefore might also exhibit some antidepressant effects in PMS.57

## deficiency Syndrome

Glycyrrhizin-containing preparations are showing promise in the treatment of HIV-related diseases, including AIDS. Although much of the research featured intravenous administration, this route of admin- istration might not be necessary, as glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid are easily absorbed orally and are well tolerated. This was most evident in a recent double-blind study on the clinical effectiveness of glycyr- rhizin by long-term oral administration to 16 hemophiliac patients with evidence of HIV infection.58 Patients received daily doses of to 225 mg of glycyrrhizin for 3 to 7 years. Helper and total T-lymphocyte numbers, other immune system parameters, and glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid levels in the blood were monitored. The results indicated that orally administered glycyr- rhizin was converted into glycyrrhetinic acid, which was detected in sera, without manifesting any side effects. None of the patients given the glycyrrhizin had progression of immunological abnormalities or development to AIDS. In contrast, the group not receiving glycyr- rhetinic acid showed decreases in helper and total T-cell counts and antibody levels. Two of the 16 patients in the control group developed AIDS. In another study, 10 HIV positive patients without AIDS took 150 to 225 mg/day of glycyrrhizin.59 After 1 to 2 years, none devel- oped symptoms associated with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, whereas 1 of 10 patients of a matched control group developed AIDS-related complex, and 2 progressed to AIDS and subsequently died. The result of glycyrrhizin in HIV-positive and AIDS patients is almost immediate improvement in immune function. In one study, 9 symptom-free HIV-positive patients received 200 to 800 mg/day of glycyrrhizin intravenously. After 8 weeks, the groups had increased T-helper cells, improved helper/suppressor ratios, and improved liver function.60 In another study, 6 AIDS patients received 400 to 1600 mg/day of glycyrrhizin intravenously.61 After 30 days, 5 of the 6 showed a reduc- tion or disappearance of the P24 antigen, which indicates active dis- ease. The results of these studies and others in HIV-positive and AIDS patients are encouraging.

## Hepatitis

Some studies of HIV patients used an intravenous glycyrrhizin-con- taining product, Stronger Neo-Minophagen C (SNMC), consisting of 0.2% glycyrrhizin, 0.1% cysteine, and 2.0% glycine in physiological saline solution. This product is used in Japan primarily for the treat- ment of hepatitis. The other components, glycine and cysteine, appear to modulate glycyrrhizin’s actions. Glycine was shown to prevent the aldosterone effects of glycyrrhizin, whereas cysteine aids the liver in detoxification reactions.

## 645CHAPTER 85 Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice)

In addition to AIDS, SNMC demonstrated beneficial results in treating chronic hepatitis B and C, often difficult infections for the body to clear.22,62-64 Specifically, SNMC was shown to improve liver function and lower levels of liver enzymes. Glycyrrhizin therapy appears particularly helpful in patients with chronic hepatitis C who fail to respond to interferon and in those who cannot be treated with it for various reasons.

## Acute Intermittent Porphyria

This disorder of heme biosynthesis is characterized by recurrent attacks of neurological and psychiatric dysfunction. The symptoms include the following: • Abdominal complaints of nausea, vomiting, and colicky pain, occa- sionally severe enough to present as an acute abdomen without fever or leukocytosis • Variable neurological signs and symptoms (e.g., paresthesia, hypesthesia, neuritic pain, wrist or foot drop, loss of deep tendon reflexes) • Variable mental and emotional disturbances, typically restless- ness, disorientation, and visual hallucinations (seen in one third of patients) Because estrogens are known to exacerbate or induce acute inter- mittent porphyria (AIP), it is quite possible that some of the so-called PMS symptoms are exacerbations of AIP caused by the midcycle estro- gen surge. A partial (50%) deficiency of uroporphyrinogen I synthase results in increased inducibility of aminolevulinic acid synthase by drugs and foreign chemicals and by 5- β -reductase steroid metabolites (potent inducers of aminolevulinic acid synthase). AIP is also associated with a marked deficiency in the activity of 5- α -reductase, resulting in increased 5- β -reductase activity.65 Glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizin were shown to significantly reduce 5- β -reductase while increasing 5- α -reductase.66 (Lead also increases 5- β -reductase activity, resulting in a presenting picture similar to AIP.66 Chronic or acute lead toxicity must be ruled out in these patients.)

## Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome

Preparations containing glycyrrhetinic acid may be effective in reducing various issues related to syndrome X or metabolic syn- drome. For example, in a preliminary study, 15 normal-weight sub- jects (7 males, 22–26 years old, and 8 females, 21–26 years old), who consumed 3.5 g/day of a commercial preparation of licorice con- taining glycyrrhetinic acid for 2 months, had reduced body fat mass of 1.2% in men and 2.8% in women.67 This weight loss might have been mediated not only via suppressing renin activity and aldoste- rone levels via inhibition of 11- β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, but also via improving blood glucose control—a key goal in syn- drome X.68-70 In another study, supplementation of a licorice root extract to moderately hypercholesterolemic patients for 1 month reduced plasma susceptibility to oxidation (by 19%). It also increased resis- tance of plasma low-density lipoprotein against three major athero- genic modifications: oxidation (by 55%), aggregation (by 28%), and retention (by 25%). It reduced plasma cholesterol levels (by 5%), which were caused by a 9% reduction in plasma low-density lipo- protein cholesterol levels, and reduced (by 14%) plasma triglyceride levels. Licorice extract supplementation also reduced systolic blood pressure by 10%.71

## Addison’s Disease

As described later in “Pseudoaldosterone Activity,” licorice exerts an aldosterone-like effect that is useful in treating Addison’s disease.

## Inflammation

Virtually any inflammatory or allergic condition may be reduced by licorice by the mechanisms discussed earlier in the section on “Pharmacology.” Historically, licorice was successfully used for treat- ing asthma and other atopic conditions.3,15 Licorice was shown to enhance the action of corticosteroids like prednisone and prednisolone, as well as the levels of the body’s own corticosteroids.72,73 In one study, six subjects received an intravenous dose of prednisolone with or without 200 mg glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin was found to significantly increase the concentration of total and free prednisolone by inhibiting its breakdown. Furthermore, the effects of prednisolone appeared to be potentiated by glycyrrhizin.73 One interesting application shown with positive clinical results in a double-blind study was reduction of postoperative sore throat.74 Forty adults who underwent elective lumbar laminectomy were randomized into two groups of 20 patients each. One group received water (Group C); the other received 0.5 g licorice in water (Group L). Both groups gargled 5 minutes before anesthesia. Postoperative sore throat inci- dence and severity as well as postextubation cough were reduced for all time points in the licorice group compared with the water group at rest and on swallowing. Postextubation cough was reduced in Group L compared with Group C (P <0.05). There was no difference in side effects between groups (P >0.05). A review study evaluated the possible application of the active com- ponents of licorice, glycyrrhizin (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment based on the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/thromboxane A2 (TxA2) pathway (Fig. 85.3).75 The COX-2/ TxA2 pathway, an auto-regulatory feedback loop, has been found to be a crucial mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RA. Both non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are typically prescribed medications for treatments of patients with RA. TxA2 is believed to be the nontar- get of NSAIDs and DMARDs, and the limitations and adverse effects of those drugs may be, at least in part, caused by lack of the effects on the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. The active components of licorice, GL and GA, could not only potentiate the therapeutic effects but also decrease the adverse effects of NSAIDs or DMARDs through suppressing the COX-2/TxA2 pathway and hold the potential as a novel add-on ther- apy in the treatment of RA.

## Sweetening Agent

Because glycyrrhizin is 50 to 100 times sweeter than sucrose, licorice can be used as a sweetening or flavoring agent to mask the bitter taste of other medications.3

# LICORICE FLAVONOID OIL

LFO shows promise as an antiobesity and weight loss agent. It is stan- dardized to contain 30% polyphenols with glabridin standardized at 3%. The flavonoids are extracted with ethanol and then solubilized in medium chain triglycerides oil (hence 70% of LFO is medium chain triglycerides). The extracted licorice flavonoids are hydrophobic com- pounds and virtually free of the hydrophilic compounds glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizinic acid (there is less than 0.005% glycyrrhizic acid in LFO). LFO decreases the activity of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzymes in the fatty acid synthetic pathway, while increasing the enzymatic activity of acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the fatty acid oxidative pathway. These effects are thought to be responsible for the reduction in abdominal fat in animal and human studies.76–79

## 646SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

In a double-blind study, 56 men and 28 postmenopausal women, aged 40 to 60 years with body mass indexes of 24 to 30 kg/m2, were randomized into four groups: the placebo group took three placebo capsules per day, the low-dose group took one LFO capsule and two placebos per day (300 mg/day LFO), the middle-dose group took two LFO capsules and one placebo per day (600 mg/day LFO), and the high- dose group took three LFO capsules per day (900 mg/day LFO). The subjects in the 900 mg LFO group experienced significant decreases from baseline in body weight and body mass index compared with the placebo group (Table 85.1).79 The subjects in all three LFO groups, but not the placebo group, had significantly lower body fat masses compared with baseline after 8 weeks of treatment. Computed tomographic scans showed that vis- ceral fat mass decreased significantly compared with baseline in the 900 mg LFO group (122.37–113.02 cm2). Another study with LFO was conducted to determine its ability to increase the muscle mass of elderly patients. Fifty subjects aged 54 to 90 years (7 men, 43 women), who underwent rehabilitation treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee, were assigned to either the LFO (300 mg per day) or placebo group. In the LFO group, muscle mass in the body trunk increased significantly after 16 weeks of LFO intake (+0.38 kg). In addition, the body fat percentage and body trunk fat percentage of the LFO group were also reduced.80 A safety study demonstrated that LFO is safe when administered once daily up to 1200 mg/day.81 There were no clinically noteworthy changes in hematologic or related biochemical parameters.

# TOPICAL APPLICATIONS

<!-- chunk -->

## Eczema and Psoriasis

Glycyrrhetinic acid exerts an effect similar to that of topical hydro- cortisone in the treatment of eczema, contact and allergic dermatitis, and psoriasis.82–85 In several studies, glycyrrhetinic acid was shown to be superior to topical cortisone, especially in chronic cases. For exam- ple, in one study of patients with eczema, 93% of the patients apply- ing glycyrrhetinic acid demonstrated improvement compared with 83% using cortisone.86 In another study, a topical gel containing 2% glycyrrhetinic acid was shown to be effective for treatment of atopic dermatitis and was more effective than preparations containing 1% glycyrrhetinic acid in reducing the scores for erythema, edema, and itching over 2 weeks.82 Glycyrrhetinic acid can also be used to potentiate the effects of topi- cally applied hydrocortisone by inhibiting 11- β -hydroxysteroid dehydro- genase, which catalyzes the conversion of hydrocortisone to an inactive form.83 It also increases the permeation of topically applied steroids. In one study, glycyrrhetinic acid in a concentration of 0.1% in gel increased diclofenac sodium flux value tenfold compared with a control gel.84

## Herpes Simplex

Clinical studies showed topical glycyrrhetinic acid and derivatives to be quite helpful in reducing the healing time and pain associated with cold sores and genital herpes.87,88 As mentioned previously, glycyr- rhizin inactivates HSV-1 irreversibly and stimulates the synthesis and release of interferon.25

## Melasma

Two components, glabrene and isoliquiritigenin, can inhibit tyrosi- nase—a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis.89 Dermatological disor- ders such as melasma, age spots, and sites of actinic damage arise from the accumulation of melasma. Glabrene and isoliquiritigenin may serve as candidates for skin-lightening agents.


The dosage of licorice for most clinical applications is based on the content of glycyrrhetinic acid. The exception is in the treatment of peptic ulcer. In this application, DGL is preferred, as it produces equally effective results compared with glycyrrhetinic acid but is free from any side effects. For most purposes, the goal is to achieve a high level of glycyrrhe- tinic acid in the blood without producing side effects (discussed later in “Toxicology”). In general, the following doses three times a day are safe and effective in raising glycyrrhetinic acid levels: • Powdered root: 1 to 2 g • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL • Solid (dry powdered) extract (4:1): 250 to 500 mg In the treatment of AIDS, pure glycyrrhetinic acid products or extracts standardized for glycyrrhetinic acid are recommended. Toxicity can become a problem for patients taking licorice for any period longer than 1 month (see “Toxicology” and “Drug Interactions”).

## Dosage Instructions for Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice

To be effective in healing peptic ulcers, it appears that DGL must mix with saliva. DGL may promote the release of salivary compounds, which stimulate the growth and regeneration of stomach and intesti- nal cells. DGL in capsule form has not been shown to be effective.90,91 The standard dosage for DGL is two to four 380-mg chewable tab- lets between or 20 minutes before meals. Taking DGL after meals is associated with poor results.92 DGL should be continued for 8 to weeks, depending on the response.

## Dosage Instructions for Licorice Flavonoid Oil

The standard dosage for LFO is 900 mg/day usually administered as 300 mg three times a day.


The main hazards of licorice administration are due to the aldoste- rone-like effects of glycyrrhetinic acid. If ingested regularly, licorice root (>3 g/day for more than 6 weeks) or glycyrrhizin (>100 mg/ day) may cause sodium and water retention, hypertension, and hypo- kalemia.8,9,93-95 Individuals with existing hypertension may be more predisposed to this effect via increased sensitivity to the inhibition of 11- β -hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase by glycyrrhetinic acid.18,82,96 Monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes and increasing dietary potassium intake is suggested, as the pseudoaldosterone effects can be quite significant. The maximal effect on blood pressure with long-term ingestion is observed after 2 weeks of use.97 There is great individual variation in the susceptibility to the symp- tom-producing effects of glycyrrhizin, primarily due to differences in pharmacokinetics and conversion to the more potent glycyrrhe- tinic acid (100–200 times more active in suppressing 11- β -hydroxys- teroid-dehydrogenase).98 Adverse effects are rarely observed at levels below 100 mg/day, whereas they are quite common at levels above mg/day.9 However, some persons may be susceptible to long-term dos- ages at even lower levels, especially if the more potent glycyrrhetinic acid is available in free form. One study determined a no-effect level of glycyrrhetinic acid at 2 mg/kg, from which an acceptable daily intake of 0.2 mg/kg body weight can be extrapolated with a safety factor of 10. This translates to a consumption of 12 mg/day of glycyrrhetinic acid for a person with a body weight of 60 kg.99 Prevention of the side effects of glycyrrhizin may be possible by fol- lowing a high-potassium, low-sodium diet. Although no formal trial has been performed, patients who normally consume high-potassium foods and restrict sodium intake, even those with high blood pressure and angina, have been reported to be free from the aldosterone-like side effects of glycyrrhizin.100 Licorice should probably not be used in patients with a history of hypertension or renal failure or in those who currently use digitalis preparations. Licorice preparations containing glycyrrhizin may reduce serum and salivary testosterone levels in men. In one study, men consuming the equivalent of 500 mg of glycyrrhizin experienced a drop of 26% in serum testosterone levels.101 However, in another study, no significant effect was noted.102 Licorice intake during pregnancy is generally regarded as safe, unless hypertension becomes an issue. There was one detailed study on maternal consumption of glycyrrhizin and how it affected birth weight.103 Glycyrrhizin intake was calculated from detailed question- naires on licorice consumption. Glycyrrhizin exposure was grouped into three levels: low (<250 mg/week), moderate (250–499 mg/week), and heavy ( ≥ 500 mg/week). Birth weight and gestational age (from ultrasound measurements) were obtained from hospital records. Babies with heavy exposure to glycyrrhizin were not significantly lighter at birth, but they were significantly more likely to be born ear- lier—2.52 days earlier. No other associations could be made.


No significant reports of drug interactions have appeared, although on theoretical grounds, licorice components have shown considerable interactions with various enzyme systems. Licorice root extract and purified glabridin were shown to inhibit P450 3A4, a major human drug metabolizing P450 enzyme, in time- and concentration-dependent man- ners, thereby potentiating the action of many drugs.104 Glycyrrhizin intake may be problematic for people on digitalis, diuretics, or anti- hypertensive medications. Also, individuals using oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin need to monitor blood sugar levels closely when using glycyrrhiza. Glycyrrhetinic acid can reduce the prevalence of side effects related to the diuretic activity of spironolactone. In a study of 32 women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, women who received 3.5 g of licorice a day with spironolactone eliminated symptoms related to volume depletion, and the activation of the renin-aldosterone system was sig- nificantly lower during spironolactone plus licorice than with spirono- lactone alone. The prevalence of metrorrhagia was also lower with the combined therapy.105

## Hydrastis canadensis

Native to North America, goldenseal root was used extensively by American Indians as an herbal medication and clothing dye. Its medicinal use centered around its ability to soothe the mucous membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary tracts in inflammatory conditions induced by allergy or infection. The Cherokee and other tribes used goldenseal in disorders of the eye and skin.7,8 Berberine was isolated from goldenseal root by early American naturalist Constantine Rafinesque in 1828. Goldenseal root featured prominently in the Eclectic medical practice of the mid-1800s, where it was recorded as among “their best articles”10 and was used for gastrointestinal complaints, jaundice, infections, as a bitter tonic to regulate bile production, and as a uterine tonic. For many of these purposes, goldenseal was considered to have no equal.11

## Coptis chinensis

In China, coptis was used in the traditional medicine system to “drain fire,” which refers to the treatment of conditions associated with infec- tions and toxemia. It was used primarily in infectious conditions, similar to the historical use of goldenseal. Specific uses included fever, dysen- tery, gastrointestinal infection, furuncles, boils, and eye infections.9


The primary medicinal value of goldenseal, barberry, Oregon grape root, and coptis is thought to be due to their high content of isoquin- oline alkaloids, of which berberine has been the most widely studied. Berberine demonstrates antibiotic, anticonvulsant, antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, choleretic, carminative, hepatoprotectant, hypo- lipidemic, hypotensive, immunostimulatory, sedative, and uterotonic activity. Berberine’s pharmacological activities strongly support the historical use of berberine-containing herbs.

## Antimicrobial, Anti-infective Activity, and Gut Health

The most broadly celebrated of berberine’s effects has been its antimi- crobial activity. Although not as potent as many prescription antibiotics, berberine exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a wide range of human pathogens that include bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, including the specific strains listed in Table 86.2.7–9,12–21 Most of these microbes have a significant effect on human health, with many affecting the gastrointestinal system. E. histolytica alone is responsible for approximately 55,000 deaths annually. Berberine exhib- its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against numerous strains of Staphylococcus, and additionally it enhances the efficacy of conventional antibiotic agents such as linezolid, cefoxitin, and erythromycin.21 Perhaps berberine’s greatest potential contribution to human health is that pathogens generally fail to develop resistance to its antimicrobial effects.22 As a result of the excessive use of antibiotics for decades, both used clinically for the treatment of infections and through exposure through the food chain from commercially raised foods, numerous bacteria have become resistant to standard treat- ment with antibiotics. Of these, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is most well known and can cause serious skin infec- tions and pneumonia that can result in death or cause other systemic infections that are resistant to treatment. MRSA most commonly occurs in hospital settings, as a result of the prevalence of patients with infectious disease, but can also arise from contact with generally healthy people. Experiments were conducted to determine whether a variety of bacteria, including E. coli, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus vul- garis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, could develop resistance to berberine. No resistance was observed after generations of exposure of these bacteria to berberine.23 Prevention of resistance was also demonstrated for berberine analogs against Acinetobacter baumannii, a bacterial pathogen that can cause serious infections of the blood, lungs, and brain.24 O O O O CH 3CH 3 OCH 3 OCH 3 H 3 CO OH H 3 CO OCH 3 OCH 3 palmatineBerberine Jatrorrhizine NOH + N + – H 3 CO N+

## 651CHAPTER 86 Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal) and Other Berberine-Containing Botanicals

Part of the ability of berberine to avoid developing bacterial resis- tance against it is that it works through multiple mechanisms of action. When an anti-infective agent, or any therapeutic agent, has a single mode of action, such as direct bactericidal activity, it is relatively easy for a pathogen, whose nature it is to survive and multiply, to quickly become resistant to the killing effects of the antibiotic. When an anti- microbial works through multiple actions, it is much more difficult for the pathogen to become resistant because it must find multiple ways to overcome the myriad of disparate killing effects of the agent. In one study, researchers demonstrated berberine’s ability to inhibit the adherence of group A Streptococci to host cells on the basis that the therapeutic effect of berberine appeared to be greater than its direct antibiotic effects.25 Other studies showed that certain antimicrobial agents can block the adherence of microorganisms to host cells at doses much lower than those needed to kill cells or to inhibit cell growth. Berberine’s ability to inhibit the adhesion of Streptococci to host cells has several modes of action. First, berberine causes Streptococci to lose lipoteichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid is the major substance responsible for adhesion of bacteria to host tissues. If the bacteria cannot adhere, it cannot become infectious. Berberine also exhibited direct bacteri- cidal activity against Streptococci agalactiae, a human pathogen that can cause meningitis, septicemia, and pneumonia. Another import- ant action of berberine is preventing the adhesion of fibronectin to the Streptococci, as well as eluting already-bound fibronectin. The binding of fibronectin to Streptococci increases the virulence of the bacteria. In contrast, inhibition of fibronectin binding has clinical relevance in both treating and preventing select infectious diseases.26,27 A unique mechanism associated with berberine’s antimicrobial activity is its ability to damage the DNA of bacteria.21 Numerous other studies elucidate other mechanisms of action that contribute to berber- ine’s antimicrobial activity, which include the inhibition of bacterial DNA duplication, bacterial RNA transcription, and bacterial protein synthesis; the inhibition of enzymes needed for bacterial proliferation; and the destruction of the bacterial biofilm and cell surface that make bacteria more susceptible to destruction by immune cells.23 This mul- titude of actions makes berberine the ideal antibiotic for modern use, especially in MRSA. Moreover, berberine has been shown to restore the efficacy of previously resistant antibiotics, such as penicillin, ampi- cillin, and oxacillin.28 The antimicrobial activity of berberine was also found to increase with pH in a number of organisms studied.13 At a pH of 8, the antimicrobial activity of berberine in vitro is typically two to four times greater than it is at pH 7, which in turn is one to four times greater than at pH 6. This suggests that alkalinization will improve the clinical efficacy of berberine, particularly in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Berberine also exhibits significant antifungal activity against Candida albicans, the overgrowth of which can result in both systemic and vaginal yeast infections. Excessive use of conventional antibiot- ics is a very common contributing factor to yeast overgrowth. The fact that berberine both acts as an antibiotic and kills Candida, again, makes it an ideal antibiotic of choice. Other fungi against which ber- berine exhibits antimicrobial activity include Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Penicillium.21 In addition to the direct actions of berberine, other studies show that other compounds in berberine-containing plants also contribute to overall antimicrobial activity because crude extracts often display greater antimicrobial activity than a comparable amount of isolated berberine.29,30 In contrast to the previous report of berberine being resistant to bacterial resistance, one study showed E. coli to become resistant to pure berberine; however, no resistance was developed for the methanolic extract, demonstrating the synergism that exists in whole-plant extracts.31 This underscores the strongly held belief of

## 652SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

medical herbalists that the activity of a botanical cannot be defined by a single compound. A unique contribution of berberine to human health is its abil- ity to promote healthy intestinal microflora. Most anti-infectious agents, such as conventional antibiotics, have a negative effect on gut flora and therefore digestion, assimilation, and gut-mediated immu- nity. Berberine promotes the growth of the Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus bacterial species normally found in healthy intestinal flora. Together, these mechanisms help reduce intes- tinal permeability,32–34 which can reduce exposure to endotoxins that can trigger inflammatory responses, damage the liver and kidneys,35 and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.36 In part, this broad spectrum of positive effects on gut health may be the primary underlying reason berberine-containing plants have been so highly regarded as traditional medicines for so long. In addition to the effects already mentioned, berberine may have a positive effect on reducing the severity or incidence of colitis via an anti-inflammatory activity through modulation of interferon, inter- leukins, and prostaglandins in the gut and systemically. This was demonstrated in colitis induced in an animal model in which berber- ine improved body weight, reduced colon shortening, prevented colon damage, and reduced histological markers of inflammation.37

## Immunostimulatory Activity and Anticancer Effects

There is an abundance of preclinical evidence for the effects of ber- berine in modulating immune responses and eliciting anticancer activity that suppresses the growth of a wide spectrum of tumors, including leukemia, melanoma, hepatoma, epidermoid carcinoma, glioblastoma, and oral carcinoma, as well as breast, lung, gastric, prostate, and cervical cancer. Berberine was also found to suppress chemical-induced carcinogenesis, tumor promotion, and tumor invasion in some animal models.38 In one study, berberine was shown to increase the blood supply to the spleen.39 This improved blood supply may promote the opti- mal activity of the spleen by increasing the release of compounds, such as tuftsin, that potentiate immune function. Research shows that berberine influences splenic antibody response.40 Berberine was also shown to activate macrophages, via both enhanced prim- ing and triggering.41 Other research demonstrated that total extract of barberry and its alkaloid fractions (berberine and oxyacanthine) elicits anti-inflammatory activity in both acute and chronic animal models of inflammation (Fig. 86.5). As in other studies reported, the total extract elicited a stronger anti-inflammatory response than the isolated fractions.42 One study suggested the anti-inflammatory activity of berberine to be associated with a modulation, not an inhi- bition, of cyclooxygenase (COX) protein.43 Berberine exhibits potent anticancer activity both directly by killing tumor cells and indirectly by stimulating white blood cells.39,41,44,45 Whereas most other actions attributed to berber- ine-containing plants are well established in the historical literature, anticancer effects seem to be a relatively modern discovery. Most anticancer data for berberine comes from in vitro and animal studies. One of the most significant effects was reported in a study demon- strating antitumor activity against human and rat malignant brain tumors.44 Several experimental approaches were used in the study. In vitro studies were performed on a series of six human malignant brain tumor cell lines and rat 9L brain tumor cells. Berberine used alone at a dose of 150 mg/mL showed an average cancer cell kill of 91%. This kill rate was more than twice that of 1,3-bis(2-chloro-eth- yl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), the standard chemotherapeutic agent for brain tumors, which had a cell kill rate of 43%. In vitro results do not always match the clinically relevant effects in vivo, so such reports have to be interpreted carefully. However, in this case, fol- low-up studies in rats with solid 9L brain tumors also demonstrated that berberine had antitumor effects. Rats treated with berberine (10 mg/kg) had an 81% cell kill. However, the combination treatment of berberine and BCNU exhibited additive effects on killing cancer cells. These results indicate that berberine may prove to be more effective than BCNU or, at the least, a valuable therapeutic addition in the treatment of difficult brain cancers. Another study demonstrated that berberine exhibited cytotoxic activity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and inhibited the repair of cancer cell DNA that subsequently resulted in the death of cancer cells.46 Berberine has also been shown to be cytotoxic against prostate cancer cells and to inhibit their proliferation in vitro, mediated primarily through the G1 phase-cycle arrest and caspase-dependent pathway.47 Berberine has been shown to possess cytotoxic activity against numerous other cancer cell lines in vitro.48 Whether this has any clinical relevance requires further in vivo research. In one such study, berberine combined with radi- ation demonstrated a synergistic anticancer effect in a lung cancer animal model.49 The ability for berberine to increase the anticancer activity of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs has similarly been determined in animal models. Of particular interest is that berber- ine not only enhanced the anticancer effects of numerous chemo- therapeutic agents but also decreased cardiac, renal, and hepatic toxicity associated with the chemotherapy.38 Berberine exhibits antioxidant and antimutagenic effects that may have relevance in carcinogenesis.50,51 If the in vitro and preclinical in vivo effects of berberine enhancing the efficacy of conventional chemothera- peutic drugs is realized in human trials, berberine will represent a novel adjunct to standard cancer therapy.

## Antipyretic Activity

Historically, berberine-containing plants were used as febrifuges. Berberine produces an antipyretic effect three times as potent as aspi- rin in a pyretic model in rats.52 However, although aspirin suppresses fever through its action on prostaglandins, berberine appears to lower Berberine NF-κB inhibition Inhibition of the expression of cytokines, eg , TNF-α, IL-13, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ , IL-β AP-1 pathway inhibition Inhibition of inflammation AMPK activation

## Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome

In another novel use, berberine possesses a wide range of antidiabetic effects, including an ability to increase insulin-receptor expression and improve glucose utility both in in vitro and in animal models, reduce insulin resistance through protein kinase C–dependent upregulation of insulin receptor expression, stimulate insulin secretion, block glu- cose absorption via inhibition of α -glucosidase and epithelial glucose transport, and reduce serum lipid levels in animal models of impaired glucose tolerance.53–55 One insulin-independent hypoglycemic activ- ity is associated with the stimulation of glycolysis and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, representing a relatively novel herbal approach to the management of diabetes.56 In addition to the myriad of hypoglycemic activity elicited by ber- berine, the formation of advanced glycosylation end products and oxi- dative stress that leads to diabetic nephropathy is suppressed by the administration of berberine.57


In more recent years there has been active research investigating the cardiac effects associated with berberine, most notably derived from Coptis chinensis. In animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, berberine decreased plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline in the heart, increasing cardiac contractility and decreasing diastolic blood pressure and vascular resistance.58


The broad antimicrobial effects of berberine, combined with the anti-infective and immune-stimulating actions reported previously, support the historical use of berberine-containing plants in infec- tions of the mucous membranes as well as the gastrointestinal sys- tem. Although the primary focus of this activity is typically correlated with antimicrobial effects, berberine also has a protective effect on the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tissues, supporting one of most unique aspects of berberine-containing plants, decreasing intestinal permeability, which has significantly positive and broad-reaching effects on improving human health.59,60 Lastly, clinical research on the use of berberine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome is extremely promising.61

## Infectious Diarrhea and Bowel Health

Berberine showed significant success in the treatment of acute diarrhea in several clinical studies. It was found to be effective against diarrheas

<!-- chunk -->

## caused by E. coli (traveler’s diarrhea), Shigella dysenteriae (shigellosis),

Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhimurium (food poisoning, infec- tious diarrhea), Klebsiella species, G. lamblia (giardiasis), and V. cholerae (cholera).62–71At least one clinical study demonstrated that patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) taking berberine had better symptom control compared with placebo.59 Similar positive findings of the effects of berberine on support- ing healthy gastrointestinal functioning are reported in preclinical research. Studies in hamsters and rats showed that berberine had sig- nificant activity against Entamoeba histolytica, the causative organism of amebiasis.15,16 In another study of animals with hemorrhagic diar- rhea, berberine successfully inhibited multidrug-resistant enteroviru- lent E. coli.72 There is good evidence that berberine is effective in treating the majority of common gastrointestinal infections, as evidenced by the widespread antimicrobial activity against major gastrointestinal pathogens such as H. pylori, Salmonella typhi, G. lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and C. albicans. In many cases, clinical studies demonstrate that berberine produces comparable effects to standard antibiotics. In several studies, the efficacy of berberine was found to be greater than that of conventional therapies.64,67,68 For example, in a study of 65 chil- dren younger than 5 years of age with acute diarrhea caused by E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Klebsiella, or Fecalis aerogenes, those given berber- ine tannate (25 mg/6 hours) responded better than those treated with standard antibiotic therapy.67 In another study, 40 children ages 1 to 10 years and infected with the parasite Giardia received either berberine (5 mg/kg body weight each day), the drug metronidazole (10 mg/kg body weight each day), or a placebo of vitamin B syrup in three divided doses.68 After 6 days, 48% of patients treated with berberine were symptom-free, and on stool analysis, 68% were Giardia-free. In the metronidazole (Flagyl) group, 33% of patients were without symptoms, and on stool analysis, all were Giardia-free. In comparison, 15% of patients on placebo were asymptomatic, and on stool analysis, 25% were Giardia-free. These results indicate that berberine was actually more effective than metro- nidazole in relieving symptoms at half the dose but less effective than the drug in clearing the organism from the intestines. Finally, in a study of 200 adult patients with acute diarrhea, the subjects were given standard antibiotic treatment with or without ber- berine hydrochloride (150 mg/day). The patients receiving berberine recovered quicker.64 An additional 30 cases of acute diarrhea were treated with berberine alone. Berberine arrested diarrhea in all of these cases, with no mortality or toxicity. Despite these results, because of the serious consequences of an ineffectively treated infectious diarrhea due to highly pathogenic organisms, it is best to consider using berberine or berberine-contain- ing plants as an adjunct to standard antibiotic therapy. Much of berberine’s effectiveness is undoubtedly due to a combina- tion of its direct antimicrobial activity, inhibition of microbial attach- ment to mucous membranes, and blocking of the action of toxins produced by several pathogenic bacteria.72–74 The toxin-blocking effect is most evident in diarrheas caused by enterotoxins (e.g., V. cholerae, E. coli), cholera, and traveler’s diarrhea.69–73 Although cholera is a serious disorder that needs standard antibiotic therapy, traveler’s diarrhea is usually self-limiting. Good results with berberine in the treatment of traveler’s diarrhea have been obtained. In one study, patients with traveler’s diarrhea randomly received 400 mg of berberine sulfate in a single dose or served as controls.72 In treated patients, the mean stool volumes were significantly less than those of controls during three consecutive 8-hour periods after treatment. At 24 hours after treatment, diarrhea ceased in significantly more treated patients compared with controls (42% vs. 20%). For people planning to travel to an underdeveloped country or an area of poor water quality or sanitation, the prophylactic use of berber- ine-containing herbs 1 week before, during, and 1 week after visiting may be useful.

## Trachoma

Water extracts of berberine-containing plants have been employed to treat various eye complaints, including infectious processes, by cul- tures throughout the world. In older studies, berberine demonstrated a remarkable effect in the treatment of trachoma in patients with active lesions. Patients were treated with either 0.2% aqueous berberine chlo- ride ophthalmic solution (two drops per eye, three times daily for weeks), 20% sulfacetamide ophthalmic solution, or both. Although the 20% sulfacetamide solution relieved clinical symptoms completely, it did not eradicate the pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis. By the end of treatment in the berberine group, patients were symptom-free and

<!-- chunk -->

## 654SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

tested negative for C. trachomatis. In 5 of 17 patients in the sulfacet- amide treatment group, symptoms recurred 4 to 6 months after treat- ment. None of the berberine-treated trachoma patients suffered from recurrence up to 1 year after treatment. The combination of berberine and sulfacetamide ophthalmic solutions provided only slightly better improvement than did berberine alone; this group was bacteria-free after treatment, with no recurrent infections.75,76 Trachoma is a major cause of blindness and impaired vision in underdeveloped countries, affecting approximately 500 million people worldwide, and results in blindness in 2 million of those affected. The drug sulfacetamide is cur- rently the most widely used antitrachoma drug. In the aforementioned study, although sulfacetamide showed the best improvement (decrease in conjunctival discharge, edema, and papillary reactions), the con- junctival scrapings of all patients receiving sulfacetamide remained positive for C. trachomatis, showing the conventional treatment was primarily symptomatic. These patients had a high rate of recurrence of symptoms. In contrast, patients treated with the berberine solution showed mild ocular symptoms, which disappeared more gradually, but their conjunctival scrapings were always negative for C. trachomatis. These patients did not have relapse even 1 year after treatment, which suggests that berberine is curative for trachoma.75,76 Berberine’s efficacy is believed to be due to stimulation of some host defense mechanism, rather than only a direct cyto- toxic action on the organism. Because the berberine concentration used in these studies was 100 times less than the concentration of sulfacetamide, and berberine is much cheaper, it may be more cost-effective than other treatments for trachoma. This suggests that berberine (0.2% solution) is an appropriate therapy for many types of conjunctivitis.

## Berberine in Liver Health

<!-- chunk -->

## Cholecystitis and Cirrhosis of the Liver

Several clinical studies demonstrate that berberine stimulates the secretion of bile (choleretic effect) and bilirubin.77–79 This is signifi- cant because bile production and secretion are the primary physio- logical mechanisms by which chemical waste products, hormones, and fat and cholesterol are removed from the body. Without this detoxification mechanism, precancerous hormones recirculate, and fats as cholesterol saturate the cardiovascular system. Bitter sub- stances, and specifically berberine-containing plants, are among the oldest traditional herbal detoxification therapies used worldwide. There are also many health benefits of bilirubin, including antioxi- dant activity.80 In one clinical study of 225 patients, oral berberine at doses of 5 to 20 mg three times a day before meals for 24 to 48 hours resolved symp- toms of chronic cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation), decreased the bilirubin level, and increased the bile volume of the gallbladder.77–79 Berberine was shown to have a beneficial effect on liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis results in an elevation of the amino acid tyramine, a sign of liver damage. Berberine both reduced tyramine in cirrhosis and prevented the elevation of serum tyramine after oral tyrosine load by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase found in bacteria in the large intestine.78 Excessive tyramine levels are also believed to be responsible for some of the cardio- vascular and neurological complications of liver disease, such as hepatic encephalopathy. The accumulation of tyramine and its derivatives may cause lowering of peripheral resistance, with resultant high cardiac output, reduction in renal function, and cerebral dysfunction. This tyramine-low- ering effect of berberine may have significance in other conditions as well.

## Liver-Protective Effects of Berberine

Berberine has marked protective effects against chemical-induced liver damage, most notably against acetaminophen (Tylenol)-induced hepatotoxicity, whose excessive use remains one of the primary causes of liver failure worldwide. In the United States, acetaminophen is responsible for more than 50% of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and more than 20% of liver transplants and has been for almost 40 years.81 Berberine significantly ameliorates acetaminophen-induced elevations in liver enzymes, another sign of liver damage, and increases concen- trations of endogenous antioxidants (e.g., glutathione), which protect against liver damage.82 In one study, a high dose (100 mg/kg per day for 10 days) was protective against liver damage caused by methotrexate, a drug used in serious forms of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.83


Berberine and its derivatives have high activity against cancer and inflammation (Fig. 86.6). Berberine and another alkaloid found in berberine-containing plants, berbamine, were shown to exert benefi- cial effects as adjuncts in cancer therapy. Berbamine has been used in China since 1972 in the treatment of depressed white blood cell (WBC) counts resulting from chemotherapy and radiation. In one study, patients with WBC counts less than 4000 were given 150 mg/day of berbamine (50 mg orally three times daily) for 1 to 4 weeks. Berbamine was viewed as “significantly effective” if WBC count increased to greater than 4000 after 1 week or increased to greater than 1000 after 2 weeks; “effective” if WBC count increased to greater than 4000 after 2 weeks or increased greater than 1000 after 4 weeks; and “ineffective” if there was no change in WBC count after 4 weeks of treatment. The overall results for the 405 patients were as follows: • Significantly effective in 163 cases (40.2%) • Effective in 125 cases (38.8%) • Ineffective in 117 cases (29%) The total effective rate was 71%. However, the WBC count before therapy was related to overall effectiveness. The effective rate was only 54.8% in 31 cases in which the WBC count was less than 1000 and 82.7% in cases in which the WBC count was between 3100 and 3800.84

## Heart Disease

Several human investigations provide evidence for the benefit of berber- ine in heart disease. In one double-blind study, 156 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) and more than 90 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, on 24-hour Holter monitoring were randomly divided into two groups. All patients were given conventional therapy for CHF, consisting of angioten- sin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, and nitrates, along with 1.2 to 2 g of berberine per day or a placebo. Symptoms, a 6-minute walk test, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), frequency and complex- ity of VPCs, and quality of life were assessed after 8 weeks of treatment and during a mean 24-month follow-up. The addition of berberine resulted in a significantly greater increase in LVEF and exercise capacity, improvement of the dyspnea-fatigue index, and a decrease of frequency and complex- ity of VPCs compared with the control group. There was also a significant decrease in mortality in the berberine-treated patients during long-term follow-up (7 patients receiving treatment died vs. 13 on placebo). There were no apparent side effects in the berberine group. Researchers con- cluded that berberine improved quality of life and decreased VPCs and mortality in patients with CHF.85 Similar findings were reported in another group of patients with refractory CHF in older studies. In this investigation, intravenous admin- istration of berberine (0.2 mg per minute for 30 minutes) significantly decreased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, decreased blood pressure, and increased the cardiac and stroke index, both measures of increased cardiac competency and overall cardiac performance.86 A number of studies conducted between 2004 and 2008 establish beneficial antilipidemic effects associated with 500 mg berberine one

to three times daily in patients with mild to moderate hyperlipid- emia, including high cholesterol levels resistant to treatment with statin drugs. Most studies were 4 to 24 weeks in duration and resulted in reductions in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of 20% to 32%, with positive results experienced within 4 weeks and greater results occurring with the longest duration of treatment.87

## Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome

Human clinical studies validate the antidiabetic effects noted in in vitro and in vivo models showing that berberine (500 mg three times a day) significantly lowered fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A 1C (HbA 1c ), triglycerides, and insulin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes melli- tus.88–90 The efficacy of berberine in lowering the fasting blood glucose and HbA 1c was similar to that of metformin and rosiglitazone. For example, in one study, berberine reduced HbA 1c from 9.5% to 7.5%, fasting blood glucose from 10.6 to 6.95 mmol/L, postprandial blood glucose from 19.8 to 11.1 ± 0.9 mmol/L, and plasma triglycerides from 1.13 to 0.89 mmol/L.91 In another study, berberine at a dosage of 1.0 g/day for 3 months decreased fasting blood glucose from 7.0 to 5.6 mmol/L, HbA 1c from 7.5% to 6.6%, triglycerides from 2.51 to 1.61 mg/ dL, total cholesterol from 5.31 to 4.35 mg/dL, and LDL-C from 3.23 to 2.55 mg/dL.90 A meta-analysis of 27 human clinical trials of the effects of berber- ine on a variety of metrics in patients with diabetes similarly supported the potential benefits of berberine in diabetes. Berberine lowered fasting blood sugar levels, postprandial plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, hyperlipidemia, blood pressure, and total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides and increased LDL- C. Berberine had a greater effect in lowering both fasting and post- prandial blood sugar levels and glycosylated hemoglobin than lifestyle modification or placebo. In this study, berberine was equally as effective as oral hypoglycemic agents. No serious side effects were reported in these studies.92 As for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, berberine with lifestyle intervention was better than lifestyle intervention alone, and berberine with oral lipid-lowering drugs was better than lipid- lowering drugs alone, in reducing the level of total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C and raising the level of HDL-C. In the comparative study between berberine and/or lipid-lowering drugs, there was no statisti- cal significance in reducing the level of TC and LDL-C, but berberine showed better effect in lowering the level of triglycerides and raising the level of HDL-C. In the treatment of hypertension, berberine with lifestyle intervention tended to lower the level of blood pressure more than the lifestyle intervention or placebo alone.92 Consistent with the in vitro and in vivo models, berberine-treated patients experienced a statistically significant increase in the per- centages of peripheral blood lymphocytes that express insulin recep- tor expression.88 In patients with chronic viral hepatitis (B and C), liver function was improved greatly through the reduction of liver enzymes. Additional mechanisms of value to patients with type diabetes include the ability to inhibit aldose reductase, lower blood lipids levels (including the ability to reduce free fatty acid levels), and protect and improve endothelial function.93 In a lipid-lowering trial in 32 hypercholesterolemic patients for 3 months, berberine (500 mg three times daily) reduced serum cholesterol by 29%, triglycerides by 35%, and LDL-C by 25%.91 Berberine lowers LDL-C by upregulating hepatic LDL-C receptor expression through a mechanism of mRNA stabilization.94 In recent years, considerable investigation of the potential use of berberine in treating metabolic syndrome has been conducted. Numerous studies demonstrate improvement in meta- bolic syndrome in vivo. In one study of humans with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 0.5 g of berberine was given three times daily at the beginning of each meal.

glucose was observed. Other beneficial effects, such as a reduction in plasma triglycerides, TC, and LDL-C, were also reported.56 In at least two other clinical studies, similar reductions in triglycerides (35% and 22%), serum cholesterol (29% and 16%), and LDL-C (25% and 20%) were observed.91,95 A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with dyslipidemia, including three trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, demonstrated that berberine significantly reduced TC, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels and significantly increased HDL-C.96 Another sys- tematic review of subjects with dyslipidemia, including patients with diabetes, similarly reported improvements in a number of metrics. Specifically, in patients with diabetes, significant reductions in TC, LDL-C, and triglycerides were observed with 500 mg berberine twice daily for 3 months.97

## Bioavailability

Modern researchers tend to lack confidence in the ability of berber- ine to elicit any therapeutic effect because of early pharmacokinetic evidence that suggested it is poorly absorbed. For example, in an early study, it was found that only 0.043% of a 100-mg oral dose of berberine was recoverable from the urine of normal volunteers after 24 hours.98 This is partly due to poor permeation of berberine through healthy intestinal tissues. Interestingly, intestinal permeabil- ity increases when tissues are inflamed, allowing for greater berber- ine absorption across diseased tissues. More recent data demonstrate that berberine and its four primary metabolites—berberrubine, thal- ifendine, demethyleneberberine, and jatrorrhizine—are detected in the liver 30 minutes after oral administration of berberine, and in bile they are detected 1 hour after oral administration.99 Additionally, the absorption of berberine when consumed in berberine-containing plants or as whole-plant decoctions is 39% to 43% greater than when isolated berberine is consumed,100 and it also increases with contin- ued use.101 Although detailed pharmacokinetic data are lacking, berberine- containing plants have been used for many millennia for many of the indications for which berberine has been shown to be effective. The available clinical and preclinical evidence provides a strong basis for efficacy. Also, these plants have predominantly been used for a variety of antimicrobial activities that, in many cases, do not require systemic absorption for efficacy, instead eliciting an effect in tissues with which berberine comes in contact, such as in the gastrointestinal system.


Because no detailed clinical studies have differentiated which berberine-containing herb to use for specific conditions, the following is offered as a guideline based on experimental stud- ies and historical use. In general, the plants can be viewed as interchangeable.

## Quality Considerations

The quality of berberine-containing plants, most notably gold- enseal, can vary widely. For example, goldenseal is very costly, which leads to widespread adulteration of the botanical in the herbal products industry. Although such adulterations are against the law, they nevertheless occur as extract manufacturers add lower-cost berberine-containing plants to increase the prof- itability of diluted goldenseal. Generally speaking, the dosage of these plants should be minimally based on berberine content, which is correlated with the intense bitterness of the plants. Because there is a wide range of quality in goldenseal prepara- tions, standardized extracts are generally recommended. In one study of 20 products purchased at local pharmacies or health food stores, 17 were labeled as containing goldenseal root, and three contained goldenseal herb as the sole active herbal ingredi- ent.102 The berberine concentration varied from 0.82% to 5.86%, whereas the hydrastine concentration ranged from 0% to 2.93%. Only 10 of 17 products met the proposed U.S. Pharmacopeia standards for the hydrastine and berberine content of gold- enseal root. Five products contained little or no hydrastine, unusual berberine-to-hydrastine ratios, and additional peaks not observed with other products. Luckily, the majority of adul- terating species do not present a health hazard and have similar activity, but conversely, they may not yield optimal amounts of berberine.

# ADVERSE EFFECTS AND TOXICITY

Berberine and berberine-containing plants are generally nontoxic at the recommended dosages. In the aforementioned meta-analysis of human clinical trials of the effects of berberine in patients with diabe- tes, no noticeable adverse effects were reported.92 However, berber- ine-containing plants are not recommended for use during pregnancy, and higher dosages may interfere with B vitamin metabolism. The oral median lethal dose in rats for berberine is greater than 1000 mg/kg body weight, indicating that the toxicity is extremely low.103


Both positive and negative interactions between berberine and conven- tional medications can occur. Berberine may interfere with the absorption of tetracycline and related antibiotics. In one double-blind study, giving subjects 100 mg of berberine at the same time as 500 mg of tetracycline four times daily led to a reduction in the efficacy of tetracycline in subjects

with cholera.68 However, another double-blind study showed no such interaction.69 Nonetheless, simultaneous use of berberine and antibiotics should only be done with great care to ensure efficacy and safety. Berberine produces significant inhibition of CYP3A enzymes in humans.94,104 Because these enzymes metabolize most drugs, berber- ine may decrease the clearance of many medications, thereby increas- ing the amount that remains in the bloodstream and altering efficacy and safety. CYP3A is involved in the metabolism of approximately half the drugs that are used today, including acetaminophen, codeine, cyclosporine, diazepam, and erythromycin. Sometimes this inhibitory effect of berberine on CYP3A may be useful for improving a thera- peutic benefit. For example, the combined use of cyclosporine with berberine markedly increased the blood concentration of cyclosporine in heart transplantation recipients, reduced the dosage of cyclospo- rine required, and showed no obvious adverse reaction.105 There are a number of other potential positive herb–drug interactions associated with berberine. Berberine increases the effectiveness of statin drugs to lower cholesterol; in one study, the effect of a simvastatin and berber- ine combination was 30% greater than simvastatin alone.106 Berberine-containing plants may enhance the effects of oral hypo- glycemic drugs through its multitude of antidiabetic effects. Patients on oral hypoglycemic drugs should take extra care in monitoring blood glucose levels if taking berberine-containing plants. Adjustment of the dose of conventional hypoglycemic agents may be required to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. As noted, positive interactions between a number of chemother- apeutic drugs are recorded in the literature. Specifically, berberine decreased the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil, arsenic trioxide, nitrogen mus- tard, camptothecin, cetuximab, erlotinib, lapatinib, gefitinib, cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and tamoxifen and additionally increased the efficacy of radiation therapy.38 Although not established in human clin- ical trials, the potential for such a positive interaction in the absence of demonstrable toxicity warrants clinical investigation.

benefits of 5-HTP might be related more to its ability to enhance endorphin levels than to its ability to increase serotonin levels. This endorphin-increasing action is useful for both migraine and tension headaches, fibromyalgia, and other painful situations. In addition, raising endorphin levels produces significant effects on mood and behavior. By raising serotonin, melatonin, and β -endorphin levels, 5-HTP has a significant effect on helping regulate and improve brain chemis- try. 5-HTP was also shown to raise the levels of other important neu- rotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine.5 The ability of 5-HTP to increase both serotonin (and other indolamines) and cat- echolamines is quite significant and unique to 5-HTP. It is an effect that 5-HTP does not share with l-tryptophan. The effective treatment of depression requires more than simply raising serotonin levels; cat- echolamine levels must also be increased; 5-HTP provides the brain with both sets of tools.

## 5-Hydroxytryptophan Versus l-Tryptophan

Nutrition-oriented physicians have long used precursor therapy for affecting brain chemistry. Unfortunately, l-tryptophan produced inconsistent results. These results were likely a result of its varying ele- vation of brain serotonin levels. In a head-to-head comparison study of 5-HTP and l-tryptophan in the treatment of depression, 5-HTP proved superior.6 The proposed reason is the fact that 5-HTP easily crosses the blood–brain barrier and is not affected by competing amino acids. 5-HTP affects brain chem- istry in a broader and more positive fashion. l-Tryptophan is often effective in cases of low serotonin, especially insomnia, but 5-HTP is more broadly effective. There are many advantages of 5-HTP over l-tryptophan. Chief among them is that 5-HTP easily crosses the blood–brain barrier and is one step further on the path to serotonin synthesis. The conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP by tryptophan hydroxylase is the most import- ant step in the manufacture of serotonin. This enzyme is inhibited by several factors, including the following: • Stress • Vitamin B 6 insufficiency • Low magnesium levels • Insensitivity to insulin • Various hormones • Genetic factors In addition, as noted earlier, these same factors and others are known to increase the activity of tryptophan oxygenase, increasing the conversion of l-tryptophan to kynurenine. Perhaps the biggest advantage of 5-HTP over l-tryptophan is that it is safer.7 Although l-tryptophan is safe if properly prepared and free of the contaminants linked to eosinophilia myalgia syn- drome (EMS), 5-HTP is inherently safer. The reasons are that tak- ing l-tryptophan to produce positive effects in the treatment of depression, insomnia, and other low-serotonin conditions requires a relatively high dose (e.g., a minimum of 2000 mg in insomnia and 6000 mg in depression). At high doses such as these, l-tryptophan is potentially problematic because more l-tryptophan will be shunted toward the kynurenine pathway, and l-tryptophan promotes oxida- tive damage. Excessive levels of dietary tryptophan or high doses of l-tryptophan result in tryptophan actually acting as a free radical.8 In contrast, 5-HTP is an antioxidant.9 This antioxidant difference is a result of the additional molecule of oxygen and hydrogen in 5-HTP. This simple change in molecular structure allows the phe- nolic ring structure to effectively accept or quench the unpaired electron of a free radical.


A massive amount of evidence suggests that low serotonin levels are a common consequence of modern living. The lifestyle and dietary practices of many people living in this stress-filled era result in low- ered levels of serotonin within the brain. As a result, many people are overweight, crave sugar and other carbohydrates, experience bouts of depression, get frequent headaches, and have vague muscle aches and pains. All of these maladies are correctable by raising brain serotonin levels. The primary therapeutic applications for 5-HTP are low-sero- tonin states, as listed in Box 87.1.


Some of the first clinical studies on 5-HTP for the treatment of depres- sion began in the early 1970s in Japan. The first study involved patients with either unipolar depression or manic bipolar depression.10 These patients received 5-HTP at dosages ranging from 50 to 300 mg/ day. The researchers observed a quick response (within 2 weeks) in more than half of the patients. Seventy-four of the patients either experienced complete relief or significantly improved, and none expe- rienced significant side effects. These promising results were repeated in several other Japanese studies. An interesting aspect in two of these studies was the fact that 5-HTP was shown to be effective in some patients (50% in one study, 35% in another) who had not responded positively to any other antidepressant agent.11,12 The most detailed of the Japanese studies was conducted in 1978.13 The study enrolled 59 patients with depression (30 males and females). The groups were mixed, in that both unipolar and bipolar depressions were included, along with a number of other subcategories of depression. The severity of the depression in most cases was moder- ate to severe. Patients received 5-HTP in dosages of 50 or 100 mg three times a day for at least 3 weeks. The antidepressant activity and clinical effectiveness of 5-HTP were determined using a rating scale developed by the Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Group in Japan. The improvements among the various patients are detailed in Table 87.1. These results indicated that 5-HTP was helpful in 14 of 17 patients with unipolar depression and 12 of 21 patients with bipolar depression. The degree of improvement in most cases ranged from excellent to very good.

The results achieved in this open study were quite good, given how rapidly they were achieved. Thirty-two of the 40 patients who responded to 5-HTP did so within the first 2 weeks of therapy. Typically, in most studies with antidepressant drugs, the benefits are not apparent until after 2 weeks to 1 month of use. For this reason, the length of study when assessing antidepressant drugs should be at least 6 weeks because it may take that long to significantly affect brain chem- istry in a positive manner. In contrast, many of the studies with 5-HTP were shorter than 6 weeks because statistically significant results were achieved so soon (Table 87.2). However, the longer 5-HTP is used, the better the results. Some people may need to be on 5-HTP for at least months before they experience benefits. The only major side effect noted in this study was mild nausea. The occurrence of nausea caused by 5-HTP is actually less frequent than that experienced with other antidepressant drugs (roughly 10% of sub- jects taking 5-HTP at a daily dose of more than 300 mg experience nausea compared with about 23% taking Prozac) and about the same as that which occurs with a placebo. In double-blind studies, about 10% or so of people taking the placebo typically complain of nausea. Nonetheless, mild nausea may be a natural consequence of elevated serotonin levels with 5-HTP. About 30% of the 5-HTP taken orally is converted to serotonin in the intestinal tract. This can lead to a mild case of nausea. Fortunately, this effect wears off after a few weeks of use. A 5-HTP dosage of 150 to 300 mg/day is sufficient in most cases. For example, in one study, it was shown that 13 of 18 subjects with depression given 5-HTP at a level of 150 or 300 mg/day experienced good to excellent results.14 This percentage of responders is quite good, but if the level of serotonin in the blood is viewed as a rough indicator of brain serotonin levels, some interesting conclusions can be made (Table 87.3). In some cases, a higher dosage may be necessary. The measurements in Table 87.3 suggest that serotonin levels in depressed individuals are considerably lower than those found in nor- mal subjects and that individuals who respond to 5-HTP show a rise in serotonin to levels consistent with normal subjects. The level of sero- tonin in those who do not respond to 5-HTP remains quite low. These results imply that nonresponders may require higher doses to raise serotonin levels or that additional support may be necessary. When prescribing higher doses, it is important that the 5-HTP be taken in divided doses not only to reduce the problem with nausea but also because the rate of brain-cell uptake of 5-HTP is limited. The first studies of 5-HTP were open trials.15 The antidepressive effects of 5-HTP were also compared with l-tryptophan in the early 1970s.6 In one study, 45 subjects with depression were given l-trypto- phan (5 g/day), 5-HTP (200 mg/day), or a placebo. The patients were matched in clinical features (e.g., age, sex) and severity of depression. The main outcome measure was a rating scale called the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the most widely used assessment tool in clinical research on depression. The HAM-D score is determined by having the test subject com- plete a series of questions in which he or she rates the severity of symp- toms on a numerical basis, as follows: • 0—not present • 1—present but mild • 2—moderate • 3—severe • 4—very severe Symptoms assessed by the HAM-D include depression, feelings of guilt, insomnia, gastrointestinal symptoms and other bodily symptoms of depression (e.g., headaches, muscle aches, heart palpitations), and anxiety. The HAM-D is popular in research because it provides a good assessment of the overall symptoms of depression. Table 87.4 shows the results of the study. A review of head-to-head comparison studies showed that 5-HTP, at a dosage of 200 mg/day, produced therapeutic success on par with

tricyclic antidepressant drugs.16 Research also showed that combining 5-HTP with clomipramine and other types of antidepressant drugs produced better results than any of the compounds given alone.17–22 For example, in one study, 5-HTP combined with a monoamine oxi- dase inhibitor demonstrated significant advantages compared with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor alone (Table 87.5).21 This line of research suggests that 5-HTP might also be used in con- junction with St. John’s wort extract and Ginkgo biloba extract, two herbal medicines with proven antidepressant activity. Because 5-HTP was expensive in 1972, researchers developed a test to determine who was most likely to respond to it so that it would not be wasted on people who were unlikely to respond.15,23 The test involved the patients first having a spinal tap to measure the level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, the breakdown product of sero- tonin) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The drug probenecid, which prevents the transport of 5-HIAA from the CSF to the bloodstream, was administered for the next 3 days. As a result of this blocking action, the amount of serotonin produced over a 4-day period could be cal- culated by a repeat spinal tap on day 4. Because the 5-HIAA could not leave the CSF, it accumulated and provided a measure of serotonin manufacture. The researchers discovered that the average level of 5-HIAA after 3 days of probenecid was significantly lower in depressed individuals than in controls matched for age, sex, and weight. This low level of serotonin reflected a decreased rate of manufacture within the brain. 5-HTP was most effective in patients with a low 5-HIAA response to 3 days of probenecid.23–25 In other words, 5-HTP is most effective as an antidepressant when the amount of serotonin manufactured in the brain is reduced. As stated earlier, 5-HTP often produces good results in patients who are unresponsive to antidepressant drugs. One of the more impressive studies involved 99 patients described as having “therapy-resistant” depression.26 These patients did not respond to any previous ther- apy, including all available antidepressant drugs and electroconvulsive therapy. These therapy-resistant patients received 5-HTP at dosages averaging 200 mg/day but ranging from 50 to 600 mg/day. Complete recovery was seen in 43 of the 99 patients, and significant improvement was noted in 8 more. Such a significant improvement in patients with long-standing, unresponsive depression is quite impressive, prompt- ing the author of another study to state the following27: l-5-HTP merits a place in the front ranks of antidepressants instead of being used as a last resort. I have never in 20 years used an agent that (1) was effective so quickly; (2) restored patients so completely to the persons they had been and their partners had known; and (3) was so entirely without side effects. In an open-label study, 15 women with major depressive disorder who had failed selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or sero- tonin–norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) monotherapy were treated with 5 g of creatine monohydrate daily and 100 mg of 5-HTP twice daily for 8 weeks. Mean HAM-D scores declined from 18.9 at pretreatment visits to 7.5 at the end of 8 weeks.28 A 1987 review article on 5-HTP in depression highlighted the need for well-designed, double-blind, head-to-head studies of 5-HTP ver- sus standard antidepressant drugs.29 Although 5-HTP was viewed as an antidepressant agent with few side effects, the authors of this review felt that the big question to answer was how 5-HTP compared with the new breed of antidepressant drugs, the SSRIs like Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft. In 1991 a double-blind study comparing 5-HTP with an SSRI was conducted in Switzerland.30 In the study, 5-HTP was compared with the SSRI fluvoxamine (Luvox). Fluvoxamine is used primarily in the United States as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder, an anxiety disorder characterized by obsessions and compulsions affect- ing an estimated 5 million Americans. Fluvoxamine exerts antidepres- sant activity comparable to (if not better than) other SSRIs like Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil. In the study, subjects received either 5-HTP (100 mg) or fluvox- amine (50 mg) three times a day for 6 weeks. The assessment meth- ods used to judge effectiveness included the HAM-D, Self-Assessment Depression Scale (SADS), and physician’s assessment (Clinical Global Impression). As indicated in Table 87.6, the percentage decrease in depression was slightly better in the 5-HTP group (60.7% vs. 56.1%). 5-HTP was quicker acting than the fluvoxamine, and a higher percent- age of patients responded to 5-HTP than to fluvoxamine. The advantages of 5-HTP over fluvoxamine are evident when looking at the subcategories of the HAM-D: depressed mood, anxi- ety, physical symptoms, and insomnia. For depressed mood, 5-HTP produced a 65.7% reduction in severity compared with 61.8% for fluvoxamine; for anxiety, 5-HTP produced a 58.2% reduction in severity compared with 48.3% for fluvoxamine; for physical symp- toms, 5-HTP produced a 47.6% decrease in severity compared with 37.8% for fluvoxamine; and for insomnia, 5-HTP produced a 61.7% decrease in severity compared with a 55.9% decrease for flu- voxamine. However, perhaps more important than simply relieving insomnia was 5-HTP’s ability to improve the quality of sleep. In contrast, antidepressant drugs greatly disrupt sleep processes. On the SADS, 5-HTP produced a 53.3% drop in SADS values compared

with a drop of 47.6% for the fluvoxamine group. A drop greater than 50% is an excellent result. A 50% drop is the best SSRIs gen- erally produce. In another head-to-head comparison study, this time with fluox- etine, 5-HTP also showed q good antidepressant effect.31 The study consisted of 60 patients suffering from their first depressive episode who were randomly divided to receive 5-HTP (group A) or fluoxetine (group B) for a period of 8 weeks. 5-HTP was given at 150 mg in three divided dosages during the first 2 weeks, and then the dose was dou- bled (300 mg) after the second week. The dosages were increased to 400 mg in three divided dosages after the fourth week. Thereafter, the same dosages were continued. All patients in group B were given flu- oxetine 20-mg capsules along with two placebo dosages during the first 2 weeks and then increased to 30 mg along with placebo dosages after the second week. All patients were administered the HAM-D to assess the severity of depression at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. A final evaluation of both efficacy and tolerance was conducted using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale at the end of the study. Results showed that both treatment groups experienced a signifi- cant and nearly equal reduction in HAM-D scores beginning at week and continuing through week 8. Twenty-two patients (73.33%) in the 5-HTP group and 24 patients (80%) in the fluoxetine group showed a positive response at the end of the study. 5-HTP was very well toler- ated, and it was concluded that 150 mg represents a minimal effective dosage in depression for 5-HTP. The existing data indicate that 5-HTP is equal to or better than standard antidepressant drugs, and the side effects are much less severe (Table 87.7). In the study comparing 5-HTP with fluvoxamine, this is how the physicians described the differences among the two groups: Whereas the two treatment groups did not differ significantly in the number of patients sustaining adverse events, the interaction between the degree of severity and the type of medication was highly significant: fluvoxamine predominantly produced moderate to severe side effects; oxitriptan (5-HTP) produced primarily mild forms of adverse effects. Fourteen (38.9%) of the patients receiving 5-HTP reported side effects compared with 18 patients (54.5%) in the fluvoxamine group. The most common side effects with 5-HTP were nausea, heartburn, and gastrointestinal problems (flatulence, feelings of fullness, and rumbling sensations). These side effects were rated as being very mild to mild. In contrast, most of the side effects experienced in the fluvox- amine group were of moderate to severe intensity. The only subject to drop out of the 5-HTP group did so after 35 days (5 weeks), whereas four subjects in the fluvoxamine group dropped out after only 2 weeks. On the basis of studies on weight loss, the longer that 5-HTP is used (e.g., after 4–6 weeks of use), the less the problem with mild nausea. 5-HTP has been shown to have “equipotency” with SSRIs and tri- cyclic antidepressants in terms of effectiveness, but it offers several advantages in that it is better tolerated and associated with fewer and much milder side effects. In addition, many people prefer to use a nat- ural substance like 5-HTP over synthetic drugs.

## l-Tyrosine: an Adjunct to 5-Hydroxytryptophan

In the early 1970s, researchers discovered that in about 20% of patients who responded well to 5-HTP, the results tended to decrease after 1 month of treatment. The antidepressant effects of 5-HTP in these subjects began to wear off gradually after the first month even though the level of 5-HTP in the blood, and presumably the level of serotonin in the brain, remained at the same level as when they were experiencing benefits.5 The researchers discovered that although serotonin levels appeared to stay at the same levels after 1 month of treatment, the levels of the other important monoamine neurotransmitters, dopamine and nor- epinephrine, declined. As discussed earlier, when depressed patients are treated with 5-HTP, they experience a rise not only in serotonin but also in catecholamines like dopamine and norepinephrine. In about 20% of subjects, the catecholamine-enhancing effects of 5-HTP tended to wear off. Providing these patients with l-tyrosine, the amino acid precursor to the catecholamines, helped reestablish the efficacy of 5-HTP.5 The dosage was 200 mg/day for 5-HTP and 100 mg/kg body weight for l-tyrosine. This dosage for l-tyrosine is quite high and requires substantial clinical supervision.

## Anxiety and Panic Disorder

5-HTP showed an ability to relieve anxiety in studies in depressed individuals. Lowering the availability of serotonin to the brain by tryp- tophan depletion increased the vulnerability of patients with panic disorder to an experimental carbon dioxide panic challenge, and increasing the availability of serotonin inhibited the response to such a challenge. When 5-HTP or placebo was given to 24 patients with panic disorder and 24 healthy volunteers before a panic challenge, 5-HTP significantly reduced the reaction to the panic challenge in patients with panic disorder regarding subjective anxiety, panic symptom score, and number of panic attacks, as opposed to placebo.32 These results indicate that 5-HTP might be helpful in relieving panic attacks.

## Weight Loss

A considerable body of scientific evidence documents the major role serotonin in the brain plays in influencing eating behavior. A key find- ing is that when animals and humans are fed tryptophan-free diets, appetite is significantly increased, resulting in binge eating—carbohy- drates would be preferable, but animals binge on whatever is avail- able.2,3 A diet low in tryptophan leads to low brain serotonin levels; as a result, the brain senses it is starving and stimulates the appetite control centers in a powerful way. This stimulation results in a preference for carbohydrates. When animals or humans are fed a carbohydrate meal, more tryptophan is delivered to the brain, resulting in more serotonin being manufactured. This scenario led to the idea that low serotonin levels lead to “carbohydrate craving” and play a major role in the development of obesity and bulimia. Cravings for carbohydrates can be mild or quite severe. They may range in severity from the desire to nibble one piece of bread or cookie

to uncontrollable binging. At the upper end of the spectrum of car- bohydrate addiction is bulimia, a potentially serious eating disorder characterized by binge eating and purging of the food through forced vomiting or the use of laxatives. The serotonin theory of bulimia is that low serotonin levels trigger binge eating, which leads to a rush of serotonin being produced and released in the brain.33,34 This increased serotonin effect produces a brief reduction in feelings of stress and tension. This serotonin “fix” is short-lived and followed by feelings of guilt and low self-esteem. The current medical treatment for buli- mia is the use of drugs that enhance the effects of serotonin. Although there are no reports in the medical literature of 5-HTP being used in the treatment of bulimia, given its effects on serotonin levels, it merits consideration. 5-HTP may help prevent the decline in serotonin levels associ- ated with reduced calorie intake. Concentrations of tryptophan in the bloodstream and subsequent brain serotonin levels plummet with dieting.35 In response to severe drops in serotonin levels, the brain puts out a strong message to eat. This situation sets up the scenario to explain why most diets do not work. As far back as 1975, researchers demonstrated that giving 5-HTP to rats who were genetically bred to overeat and be obese resulted in a significant reduction in food intake.36 It turns out that these rats bred to be fat had decreased activity of the enzyme that converts tryptophan to 5-HTP and subsequently to serotonin. There is circumstantial evidence that many humans are geneti- cally predisposed to obesity. This predisposition may involve the same mechanism as rats genetically predisposed to obesity. By providing preformed 5-HTP, this genetic defect is bypassed, and more serotonin is manufactured. The early animal studies with 5-HTP as a weight-loss aid were followed by a series of three human clinical studies. The first study involved 19 significantly overweight female subjects with a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 30 to 40 kg/m2.37 Analysis of the pretreat- ment dietary intake concluded that these women tended to overeat carbohydrates. Food intake and eating behavior were assessed using a 3-day diet diary at the beginning and end of the two treatment periods. All food was carefully weighed before meals and weighed again if there were any leftovers. Participants also filled out a self-evaluation of appe- tite and satiety twice a week, and mood was evaluated using standard psychological tests. The daily dosage of 5-HTP used in the study was 8 mg/kg body weight. Patients were given either 5-HTP or placebo 20 minutes before meals for 5 weeks, and after a 1-week interval, they were switched to receive the other treatment. No dietary restrictions were prescribed because the researchers wanted to answer the question, “Does 5-HTP reduce appetite and promote weight loss without any conscious effort?” To make sure that the women actually took the 5-HTP, researchers measured the level of the serotonin breakdown product, 5-HIAA, in the urine. Table 87.8 lists the results of the study. These results with 5-HTP were achieved without the women making any conscious effort to reduce food consumption. The average amount of weight loss during the 5-week period of 5-HTP supplementation was a little more than 3 lb, compared with less than 1 lb of total weight loss during the placebo period. Interestingly, evaluation of the various self-tests indicated that appetite or degree of initial hunger did not differ between the two groups. What differed was satiety. In other words, the 5-HTP did not reduce appetite before a meal, but after consuming an adequate amount of food, the satiety centers in the brain were stimulated, and the women did not feel hungry. As a result, their caloric intake was dramatically reduced. The level of 5-HIAA, the breakdown product of serotonin, in the group receiving the 5-HTP increased by more than fiftyfold over the control group. This increase provided two things: (1) it assured researchers that subjects actually took the 5-HTP, and (2) it clearly indicated that 5-HTP increased serotonin manufacture. The next study sought to determine whether 5-HTP helped over- weight individuals adhere to dietary recommendations.38 Fourteen overweight female subjects with a BMI between 30 and 40 kg/m2 were enrolled in the double-blind study.10 Again, analysis of the pretreat- ment dietary intake concluded that these women tended to overeat. The women were randomly assigned to receive either 5-HTP (300 mg) or placebo 30 minutes before meals. The 12-week study was divided into two 6-week periods. For the first 6 weeks, there were no dietary recommendations, and for the second 6 weeks, the women were placed on a 1200-calorie diet. The women were seen every 2 weeks to evaluate body weight, diet diaries, self-evaluations of appetite, and satiety. The women were also asked if they experienced the presence of meat aversion; taste or smell alterations; early satiety; and nausea or vomiting, or both. To verify patient compliance, urinary measurement of 5-HIAA was again deter- mined. As shown in Table 87.9, the women taking the placebo lost 2.28 lb, whereas the women taking the 5-HTP lost 10.34 lb. Like the previous study, 5-HTP appeared to promote weight loss by promoting satiety. Although some women reported some aver- sion to meat or altered taste and smell, each woman (100%) reported early satiety (Table 87.10). Most of the women receiving 5-HTP also

experienced mild nausea during the first 6 weeks of the trial, but during the last 6 weeks, none complained of nausea. The fact that weight loss was accelerated during the second 6-week period makes it highly unlikely that 5-HTP promoted weight loss as a result of pro- ducing nausea. One study with 5-HTP enrolled overweight women with a BMI ranging between 30 and 40 kg/m2 and an overactive appetite.39 The 28 subjects of the study were given either 5-HTP (300 mg three times daily before meals) or a placebo. For the first 6 weeks, there were no dietary restrictions, and for the second 6 weeks, the women were placed on a diet of 1200 calories/day. Carbohydrates contributed 53% of the calories, fats comprised 29%, and proteins provided 18%. No carbohydrate-rich foods were permitted between meals. Subjects were examined every 2 weeks to evaluate food intake and body weight. Routine blood measurements were also performed at the beginning, at 6 weeks, and at the end of the study. To verify patient compliance, urinary measurement of 5-HIAA was determined. The results from this study were even more impressive than the previous studies, for several reasons. The group receiving the 5-HTP lost an average of 4.39 lb after the first 6 weeks and an average of 11.63 lb after 12 weeks. In comparison, the placebo group lost an average of only 0.62 lb after the first 6 weeks and 1.87 lb after 12 weeks. The lack of weight loss during the second 6-week period in the placebo group obviously reflected the fact that the women had difficulty adhering to the diet. Early satiety was reported by 100% of the subjects during the first 6-week period. During the second 6-week period, even with severe caloric restriction, 90% of the women taking 5-HTP reported early satiety. Once again, many of the women receiving the 5-HTP reported mild nausea during the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the symp- tom was never severe enough for any of the women to drop out of the study. No other side effects were reported. On the basis of the urinary measurements of 5-HIAA, the women took their 300 mg of 5-HTP with meals and, as a result, achieved weight loss. The amount of weight loss was amplified by a better capability to adhere to a 1200-calorie diet. The structure of the dietary changes reflected primarily a reduction in pasta, bread, and other carbohy- drate-rich foods (the study was conducted in Rome). In the latest study, 25 overweight outpatients with non–insulin-de- pendent diabetes were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study and randomized to receive either 5-HTP (750 mg/day) or a pla- cebo for 2 consecutive weeks, during which no dietary restrictions were prescribed.40 Results again indicated that patients receiving 5-HTP sig- nificantly decreased their daily energy intake by reducing carbohydrate and fat intake and reduced their body weight.

## Insomnia

Several clinical studies showed 5-HTP produced good results in promoting and maintaining sleep in normal subjects and in those experiencing insomnia.39–46 One of the key benefits with 5-HTP in the treatment of insomnia is its ability to increase sleep quality. This effect is evident by its ability to increase rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (typically by about 25%) while simultaneously increas- ing deep sleep stages 3 and 4 without increasing total sleep time.39,42 The sleep stages that are reduced by 5-HTP to compensate for the increases are non-REM stages 1 and 2, the least important stages of sleep. In one of the studies, the subjects receiving 200 mg of 5-HTP increased their amount of REM sleep by 15.5 minutes during the 5-night study.39 Subjects taking 600 mg of 5-HTP increased REM sleep time by an average of 20 minutes for the 5-night study. These results indicated that 5-HTP increased the amount of dream time by about 3 to 4 minutes a night. Although there was a clear dose-related effect, the lower dosage is sufficient in most cases. In addition, taking too much 5-HTP may increase REM sleep to an abnormal level, leading to an increased risk for nightmares. That said, 5-HTP might prove effective in sleep terrors in children. To test this hypothesis, an open trial in a group of children with sleep terrors was compared with a group of children with the same disorder but without 5-HTP treatment.47 5-HTP was administered (2 mg/kg per day) at bedtime to 31 randomly selected patients for consecutive days. After 1 month of treatment, 29 of 31 (93.5%) patients showed a positive response. In the comparison group without drug therapy, after 1 month, the episodes disappeared in only 4 children (28.6%), whereas 10 children (71.4%) showed persistence of episodes with the same frequency as before. After 6 months, 26 of 31 (83.9%) children treated with 5-HTP were sleep terror–free, whereas in five children (16.1%), sleep terror episodes persisted. Of the children in the comparison group, 10 (71.4%) continued to show sleep terrors at 6-month follow-up. These results represent preliminary evidence that treatment with 5-HTP is able to modulate the arousal level in children and induce a long-term improvement in sleep terrors.

## Migraine and Tension Headaches

The relationship between serotonin and headaches is fully described in Chapter 198. Because patients with migraines have low levels of sero- tonin in their tissues, some researchers refer to migraine headaches as a “low-serotonin syndrome.”46 Although the primary benefit of 5-HTP in the prevention of both migraine and tension headaches is related to its ability to normalize underlying imbalances in the serotonin system, it also influences the endorphin system in a positive way. Several clinical studies on the use of 5-HTP for headaches, both vascular and nonvascular, showed excellent results. In particular, the use of 5-HTP in the prevention of migraine headaches offers consider- able advantages over drug therapy. Although a number of drugs were shown to be useful in the prevention of migraine headaches, all of them carry significant side effects. The problem with drug therapy in the prevention of migraine headaches is perhaps best exemplified by one of the most commonly used drugs, methysergide (Sansert). Methysergide therapy for the pre- vention of migraine attacks is effective in about 60% to 80% of cases. However, this effectiveness is not without a high price because side effects are quite common and can be severe. Retroperitoneal fibrosis, pleuropulmonary fibrosis, and fibrotic thickening of cardiac valves may occur in patients receiving long-term methysergide maleate ther- apy. Therefore this preparation must be reserved for prophylaxis in patients whose vascular headaches are frequent or severe and uncon- trollable and for those who are under close medical supervision. Several studies compared 5-HTP with methysergide in the preven- tion of migraine headaches. In one of the largest double-blind studies, 124 patients received either 5-HTP (600 mg/day) or methysergide (3 mg/day) in identical pills for 6 months.48 Treatment was determined successful if there was a reduction of greater than 50% in the frequency of attacks or in the number of severe attacks. Although 75% of the patients (30 of the remaining 40 patients) taking methysergide demon- strated significant improvement compared with 71% of the patients (32 of the 45 patients) taking 5-HTP, this difference was not viewed as statistically significant (Table 87.11). The advantage of 5-HTP over methysergide was demonstrated when researchers looked at side effects. Side effects were more frequent in the group receiving methy- sergide than in the 5-HTP group. Five patients in the methysergide group withdrew during the trial because of side effects. Two other studies comparing 5-HTP with drugs used in the preven- tion of migraine headaches (pizotifen and propranolol) demonstrated that 5-HTP compared quite favorably in terms of effectiveness.49,50

Although these drugs have significant side effects, 5-HTP is extremely well tolerated even at dosages as high as 600 mg/day. One of the other key differences noted in these studies between 5-HTP and the other drugs was 5-HTP’s ability to improve mood and relieve feelings of depression. In a double-blind study of 5-HTP in chronic tension headache, patients with chronic tension-type headaches were treated with 5-HTP (300 mg/day) or a placebo for 8 weeks.48 In comparison with the group treated with a placebo, there were no statistically significant changes in the number of days with headache or in headache intensity in the group treated with 5-HTP; however, there was a significant decrease in the consumption of analgesics.51 During the 2 weeks after treatment, there was also a significant decrease in the number of days with head- ache. Subjective opinion during this latter period was also favorable to 5-HTP.

## Juvenile Headache

One of the best uses of 5-HTP is in chronic headaches in children. These headaches are a big problem because of the tremendous risk for side effects of the current drugs used to treat, and prevent, them. Several studies of 5-HTP in the treatment of chronic headaches in chil- dren and adolescents showed excellent results.52–54 Given the risks of current drugs used in chronic childhood headaches, a trial of 5-HTP for 2 months certainly seems reasonable. If the headaches are also accompanied by sleep disorders, 5-HTP appears to be especially well suited. In one study, 48 elementary and junior high students with recurrent headaches (at least one headache every 2 weeks) and sleep disorders, including difficulty in getting to sleep, frequent awakenings, sleep- walking, nightmares, and bedwetting, were divided into two groups.52 Group A was given 5-HTP for 2 months, followed by a placebo for 2 months, whereas group B received just the opposite. It was necessary to divide group A into a nine-patient subgroup, group C. These nine patients did so well on the 5-HTP that they did not want to switch over to the other medication, although they had no idea whether they were, in fact, taking 5-HTP or were on a placebo. The dosage of 5-HTP was based on the child’s weight (4.5 mg/kg per day). The headache index was reduced by about 70% when the kids were taking 5-HTP compared with an 11.5% drop when they were taking the placebo. In the nine patients in group C, there was an 81.8% decrease in the headache index after the second month. Interestingly, these same patients only exhibited an 18.2% reduc- tion after the first month. These results indicate that an evaluation of the benefits of 5-HTP in the treatment of headaches requires at least a 2-month trial. The failure to show benefit with 5-HTP in some studies in headaches might be because of the fact that they lasted less than 2 months. The 25 patients experienced a modest reduction in frequent awakenings, nightmares, sleepwalking, and talking while asleep and no change in difficulty falling asleep or in bedwetting. Overall, this study demonstrated very good effects in these chil- dren. Perhaps the most impressive aspect to consider, however, was the fact that these benefits were achieved without side effects. Not a single child reported a side effect while taking 5-HTP. Interestingly, for some reason, children rarely experience even mild nausea from 5-HTP. The possible benefits of using 5-HTP in children with recurrent headaches or sleep disorders, or both, is far-reaching. Evaluation of the 48 children in the trial demonstrated inadequate school progress com- pared with their classmates. The children were shown to be of normal intellectual capacity but demonstrated inattentiveness similar to that observed in depression. Many of the children might have had depres- sion. The unwillingness of the nine subjects in group C to switch to the other unknown medication (which was the placebo) is a strong indi- cator that these children and their parents noted some rather dramatic improvements beyond simply a reduction in headaches or improved sleep. The manner in which 5-HTP may be of benefit in migraine head- aches may not simply be the overcoming of some defect in serotonin synthesis. As noted previously, part of the clinical benefit of 5-HTP may be via an ability to increase the levels of β -endorphin. A decrease in β -endorphin levels in patients with migraine headaches, and tension headaches, was demonstrated by several investigators.55,56 A clinical trial measured the effects of 5-HTP on serotonin and β -endorphin levels in 20 juvenile patients with migraine or ten- sion-type headaches.57 Patients were monitored and evaluated for the frequency and intensity of headache attacks for 3 months before 5-HTP treatment and during 3 months of therapy. The researchers reported a statistically significant reduction in the headache score with 5-HTP treatment in both migraine and tension-type patients. These improve- ments were likely a result of increased β -endorphin levels, as noted in Table 87.12. However, the level of β -endorphins achieved with 5-HTP, especially as measured in the white blood cell, was still far less than that observed in control patients without recurrent headaches. These results imply that longer periods of 5-HTP supplementation may be required before there is a normalization of β -endorphin levels in children prone to headaches.

These results may indicate that 5-HTP alone is not able to raise β -endorphin levels sufficiently to reduce or eliminate headaches, sug- gesting that other therapies designed to increase β -endorphin levels should be used along with 5-HTP. Examples of other therapies that have been shown to raise β -endorphin levels are exercise, acupuncture, and biofeedback.

## Fibromyalgia

The history of the development of 5-HTP as an effective treatment for fibromyalgia began with studies on the drug fenclonine.58 This drug blocks the enzyme that inhibits the conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP and, as a result, blocks serotonin production. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was thought that increased serotonin forma- tion might promote migraine headaches (the opposite of what was later proved, i.e., increasing serotonin levels reduced the occurrence of migraine headaches). The researchers discovered that providing headache patients with fenclonine resulted in severe muscle pain. This effect was the exact opposite of what was expected, but it led to some important advances in the understanding of fibromyalgia—a way to induce its severe symptoms of (and symptoms nearly identical to) eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS), the condition caused by con- taminated l-tryptophan. The researchers also discovered that migraine patients had a greater reaction to the drug than nonheadache subjects. In most normal subjects, fenclonine produced no fibromyalgia. These occurrences highlighted just how sensitive migraine patients are to low serotonin levels. Migraine headaches and fibromyalgia share a common feature: both are low-serotonin syndromes.59 After more than 25 years of research, one of the lead researchers stated: “In our experience, as well as in that of other pain specialists, 5-HTP can largely improve the pain- ful picture of primary fibromyalgia.”60 A double-blind study in 50 patients with fibromyalgia found that 100 mg of 5-HTP three times per day significantly improved their symp- toms.61 As shown in Table 87.13, 5-HTP was rated substantially better than placebo by subjects and evaluating physicians. Improvements were noted in all symptom categories: number of painful areas, morn- ing stiffness, sleep patterns, anxiety, and fatigue. In another study, mg of 5-HTP taken three times a day demonstrated maximum results by day 30 of the 90-day trial.62 One of the primary benefits with 5-HTP in fibromyalgia may be its ability to improve sleep quality. A key finding in patients with fibro- myalgia is a reduced REM sleep and an increase in non-REM sleep.63 In addition, the deeper levels (stages III and IV) are not achieved for long enough periods. As a result, people with fibromyalgia wake up feeling fatigued and in pain. The severity of the pain of fibromyalgia correlates with the rating of sleep quality. For example, a study of women with fibromyalgia syndrome recorded their sleep quality, pain intensity, and attention to pain for 30 days, using palm-top computers programmed as electronic interviewers.64 They described their previ- ous night’s sleep quality within 30 minutes of awakening each day and rated their present pain at randomly selected times in the morning, afternoon, and evening. The researchers found that a night of poor sleep was followed by a significantly more painful day, and a more painful day was followed by a night of even poorer sleep. 5-HTP might help break the cycle by addressing the low serotonin level and by pro- moting restful sleep.

## Parkinson’s Disease

The use of 5-HTP in Parkinson’s disease provides some benefit but only if used in combination with the drug Sinemet (the combination of l-dopa with the decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa). Although brain levels of serotonin are decreased in Parkinson’s disease, the reduction in dopamine receptors is more severe. Increasing serotonin levels with 5-HTP in patients not taking Sinemet is associated with worsening of symptoms, especially rigidity.65 One of the key benefits of taking 5-HTP in Parkinson’s disease is that it can help counteract the negative effects that the l-dopa in the Sinemet has on sleep and mood.66–68 In addition, 5-HTP was also shown to improve the physical symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. About 9 of 10 people with Parkinson’s disease have depression. The degree of depression in Parkinson’s disease is a reflection of the individual’s serotonin levels. The lower the level of serotonin, the more severe is the individual’s depression. One study examined the effect of 5-HTP in seven patients with Parkinson’s disease, all of whom were on Sinemet.65 The initial dosage of 5-HTP was 75 mg, which was increased by 25 mg every 3 days until the patients reported relief of their depression, or up to a maximum of 500 mg/day for months. The impressive results obtained in these patients are shown in Table 87.14. Six of seven patients responded to 5-HTP. It should be noted that the doses of 5-HTP in five of the six patients who responded ranged from only 75 to 125 mg. The only patient who did not respond took 500 mg of 5-HTP.

## Seizure Disorders

Most of the recent research on 5-HTP focused on its use in the treat- ment of several seizure disorders.69–74 5-HTP showed good results in most (but not all) studies in patients with diseases characterized by myoclonus, with the exception of epilepsy, which is not helped by 5-HTP. The best response to 5-HTP for myoclonus occurs in people who have intention myoclonus, which is most often produced as a result of ischemic damage to the brain. Intention myoclonus can be a problem after a stroke or heart attack, overdosage of a drug such as heroin, a severe asthma attack, or an adverse reaction to anesthesia or another chemical. Improvements with 5-HTP were demonstrated in patients with intention myoclonus. 5-HTP also

produced good results in patients with progressive myoclonus epi- lepsy, essential myoclonus, palatal myoclonus, and Friedreich’s ataxia. In a 1983 article, one researcher of 5-HTP stated: “Some helpless bedridden patients dramatically improved to the extent that they could walk again and resume independent living.”74 Because of the phenomenal results, 5-HTP was the first compound to be evaluated as an orphan drug by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Associations Commission on Drugs for Rare Diseases.

## Irritable Bowel Syndrome and the “Leaky Gut”

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is often accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier function and “leaky gut” syndrome. Decreased sero- tonergic function appears to play a part in the intestinal barrier dys- function. In an interesting double-blind study, 15 patients with IBS and 15 healthy volunteers ingested either 100 mg 5-HTP or a pla- cebo.75 Oral 5-HTP administration significantly increased mucosal levels of 5-HIAA in both healthy controls and patients with IBS, with the latter group showing a significantly larger increase. Urinary lactu- lose/L-rhamnose ratios were significantly lower after administration of 5-HTP in healthy controls and were accompanied by redistribution of zonula occludens-1, pointing to reinforcement of the barrier. In IBS, expression of the tight-junction proteins was significantly lower com- pared with healthy controls, and 5-HTP resulted in a further decrease in occludin expression. These results indicate that in healthy controls, a reinforcement of the intestinal barrier was seen with 5-HTP intake, whereas such reaction was absent in patients with IBS. This could indicate the presence of a serotonin-mediated mechanism aimed to reinforce the function of the intestinal barrier, which seems to be dys- functional in patients with IBS.


Enteric-coated preparations are required to avoid nausea. The dosage should be started at 50 mg three times daily. If the response is inade- quate after 2 weeks, increase the dosage to 100 mg three times daily. This recommendation will greatly reduce the mild symptoms of nau- sea often experienced during the first few weeks of 5-HTP therapy. Because 5-HTP does not rely on the same transport vehicle as l-tryp- tophan, it can also be taken with food. Because the half-life of 5-HTP is relatively short (3–4 hours, with peak serum levels achieved at 1–2 hours), more frequent dosing may be more effective than single higher doses. For insomnia, the general recommendation is 100 to 300 mg, 30 to 45 minutes before retiring. Start with the lower dose for at least 3 days before increasing the dose.


The major concern with 5-HTP is a possible link to l-tryptophan and EMS. However, an important distinction must be made in the manu- facturing process. Although l-tryptophan is produced via bacterial fer- mentation and filtration, 5-HTP is commercially available through an extraction process from the seed of Griffonia simplicifolia, an African plant. 5-HTP extracted from this natural source avoids the contami- nation problem associated with past manufacturing of l-tryptophan. Detailed analyses of all evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other experts led to the conclusion that the cause of the EMS epidemic could be traced to a single Japanese manufac- turer, Showa Denko.76,77 Of the six Japanese companies that supplied l-tryptophan to the United States, Showa Denko was the largest (50%– 60% of all the l-tryptophan). The l-tryptophan was used not only as a nutritional supplement but also in infant formulas and nutrient mix- tures for intravenous feeding. A single case report linked 5-HTP to a condition like EMS in 1980.78 However, this case involved the use of high dosages of 5-HTP (1400 mg) over a 20-month period. Further examination of the patient indicated a defect in tryptophan metabolism that resulted in elevations in kynurenine. Such defects in tryptophan metabolism are common in patients with scleroderma, which shares many common features with EMS. It appeared that either the 5-HTP might have contained a contaminant to which this man was sensitive or that taking such high doses of 5-HTP over a prolonged period of time aggravated his abnor- mal handling of l-tryptophan. There was also a report of a 28-year-old woman, her husband, and her two sons, 33 and 13 months old, who developed an EMS-like ill- ness in response to contaminated 5-HTP.76 The young boys inherited the inability to convert tryptophan to 5-HTP. As a result, they required daily administration of 5-HTP (5–7 mg/kg). Both boys received the 5-HTP almost from birth. The mother was not taking 5-HTP, but she prepared it for the young boys by opening the capsules, mixing the powder in juice or water, and giving it to them orally with a syringe. She never took the 5-HTP; she only touched it with her hands as she emptied the capsules. When the second boy was about 9 months old, the mother began experiencing symptoms of EMS. After consulting a physician in July 1991, it was noted that her eosinophil count was well over 30%. She continued to worsen and was hospitalized in August 1991 with a ten- tative diagnosis of EMS. At this time, she was referred to the National Institutes of Health for further evaluation. Because of the possible link between the mother’s symptoms and the 5-HTP, the boys and the father were also evaluated. The older boy had an eosinophil count of 9% (normal is 1%–4%), and the younger boy had a count of 6%. The father had no abnormalities. The 5-HTP that the boys used was analyzed by high-pressure liq- uid chromatography and found to contain an impurity not found in the 5-HTP that the National Institutes of Health used in its studies for ataxia and myoclonus. Switching the boys to the contaminant-free 5-HTP brought about a normalization of the eosinophil counts. The mother’s case was interesting because she was the most severely affected, and skin exposure was the only contact with the contami- nated 5-HTP. In 1998, researchers at the Mayo Clinic identified trace levels of a compound termed “peak X” as the key contaminant using a sensitive laboratory technique.79 As a result, manufacturers of 5-HTP now screen for the presence of this compound to ensure that all of the 5-HTP on the marketplace is free from peak X as outlined in current Food and Drug Administration methodology. A minor chromatographic peak (peak X) reported in some 5-HTP samples lacks credibility because of chromatographic artifacts and infinitesimal concentrations and has raised undue speculations concerning its chemistry and toxic- ity. It might also be a moot point because extensive analyses of sev- eral sources of 5-HTP showed no toxic contaminants similar to those associated with l-tryptophan, nor the presence of any other significant impurities.80 There have been no reports of a single person developing EMS from 5-HTP despite its popularity over the past 20 years. Nonetheless, to be on the safe side, some experts recommend that long-term continual use of 5-HTP be monitored by regular (every 6 months) eosinophil determination. Evidence that uncontaminated 5-HTP does not cause EMS is also provided by researchers who have been using 5-HTP for more than years. They state: “EMS has never appeared in the patients of ours who received only uncontaminated l-tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan

(5-HTP).”81 Furthermore, researchers at the National Institutes of Health studying the effects of uncontaminated 5-HTP on various met- abolic conditions have not observed a single case of EMS, nor has a case of elevated eosinophils been attributed to 5-HTP in these stud- ies.82 In short, there has never been a report of uncontaminated 5-HTP causing EMS. Although there has never been a single person developing EMS from 5-HTP products proven to be free from the contaminants, long- term continual use of 5-HTP should be monitored by regular (every months) eosinophil determination. For any person with scleroderma resulting from the problem with tryptophan metabolism noted in these patients, an eosinophil determination after the first month of 5-HTP use is indicated, especially if dosages are greater than 500 mg/ day. In addition is the following advice: • Do not use 5-HTP during pregnancy or lactation. • Do not use 5-HTP in Parkinson’s disease unless the patient is on Sinemet. • Do not use 5-HTP in patients with scleroderma.


Because 5-HTP is the direct precursor to serotonin, it should not be used by individuals taking antidepressant drugs without close medical supervision. Although 5-HTP has been used safely in combination with prescription antidepressant drugs in clinical studies, taking this combination could result in too much serotonin in the body. The result is a condition known as the “serotonin syndrome,” characterized by confusion, fever, shivering, sweating, diarrhea, and muscle spasms. 5-HTP may antagonize the effects of drugs used in migraine head- aches like methysergide and cyproheptadine, which block serotonin effects. The drug carbidopa greatly enhances the half-life and produces an apparent clearance at least 14 times smaller, and an area under the curve that is 15.4 times greater, compared with 5-HTP 100 mg given with- out carbidopa.83 By combining 5-HTP with carbidopa, increased bio- availability for brain penetration and decreased peripheral side effects would be expected because of reduced peripheral decarboxylation of 5-HTP to serotonin. However, in a double-blind study in healthy male volunteers, nausea and vomiting occurred dose-dependently as the most frequent side effects, resulting in dose-related dropout of 6.6% at 100 mg and 45.5% at 300 mg 5-HTP.80

## 671CHAPTER 88 Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort)


St. John’s wort has a long history of folk use. Dioscorides, the foremost physician of ancient Greece, as well as Pliny and Hippocrates, used St. John’s wort in the treatment of many illnesses. Its Latin name, H. perforatum, is derived from Greek and means “over an apparition,” a reference to the belief that the herb was so obnoxious to evil spirits that a whiff of it would cause them to depart. The naming of St. John’s wort has its origins in folk traditions. One claims that the red spots, symbolic of the blood of St. John, appeared on the leaves of the plant on the anniversary of the saint’s behead- ing. Another comes from a common medieval belief that if one slept with a piece of the plant under a pillow on St. John’s Eve, “the Saint would appear in a dream, give his blessing, and prevent one from dying during the following year.” Many people from the time of the ancient Greeks through the Middle Ages believed St. John’s wort to have magical powers. Recent research on St. John’s wort appears to offer some explanation of this “magical” power. On the basis of a long history of use as a mood- elevating substance and preliminary in vitro experiments and clinical studies, in 1984, the German Commission E permitted the medicinal use of St. John’s wort for depression, anxiety, or nervous excitement. The Commission E evaluates efficacy of herbal medicines on the basis of a doctrine of reasonable certainty, in contrast to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s doctrine of absolute proof. Herbal prod- ucts can be marketed in Germany with drug claims if they are proven to be safe and effective. Whether the herbal product is available by pre- scription or over the counter is based on its application and safety of use. Herbal products sold in German pharmacies are reimbursed by insurance if they are prescribed by a physician. Because the German system allowed companies to market their products according to the guidelines of the Commission E, many companies achieved commercial success allowing them to fund the necessary research to gain greater acceptance within mainstream conventional medicine. St. John’s wort extract in the treatment of depression is a perfect case in point to illustrate how the Commission E monographs fueled the science of botanical medicine. For example, it was originally thought that hypericin acted as an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), thereby resulting in the increase of central nervous system (CNS) monoamines such as serotonin and dopamine. However, newer research indicates that St. John’s wort pos- sesses no in vivo inhibition of MAO. Apparently, the antidepressant activities are related more to modulating the relationship between the immune system and mood, as well as by inhibiting serotonin reuptake. In addition, it appears that although hypericin is an important marker that correlates with clinical efficacy, other compounds such as fla- vonoids are thought to play a major role in the pharmacology of St. John’s wort. More than 27 double-blind randomized trials, involving more than 3800 patients with mild to moderately severe depression, showed that St. John’s wort extracts standardized for hypericin had excellent results in the treatment in mild to moderate depression, with far fewer side effects than standard antidepressant medications.6 For patients with preexisting conductive heart dysfunction or elderly patients, high-dose hypericum extract is safer with regard to cardiac function than tricyclic antidepressants.7


St. John’s wort extracts (primarily of the flowering tops) have shown a wide variety of effects in experimental and clinical studies. Some of the activities demonstrated include the following1: • Antidepressant effects • Antiviral effects • Antibiotic effects • Increased healing of wounds and burns

## Antidepressant Activity

As a testament to the wise complexity of the natural world, hypericum has a number of pleiotropic effects that are probably, in a synergis- tic fashion, responsible for its antidepressant activity. These include, but are not limited to, MAO A and B inhibition, modulation of IL-6 activity, serotonin reuptake inhibition, sigma 1-receptor activation, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) inhibition, and hypothalamic gene transcription.

## MAO Inhibition

Among the different biological hypotheses for depression, the biogenic amine hypothesis is the most widely accepted. This hypothesis suggests that depression is the result of a deficiency in function of the biogenic amines (e.g., serotonin, catecholamines, dopamine). These neurotrans- mitters are stored in granules within neurons. After stimulation of the neurons, these neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis. After binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotrans- mitters are either taken up again and restored in the vesicles or they are catabolized by the enzymes MAO or catechol-O-methyltransferase OH OH OH OH H 3 C H 3 C OH OH O O

## 672SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

(COMT). Most antidepressant drugs increase the availability of these amines, particularly serotonin, by either inhibiting the reuptake or blocking MAO. As stated earlier, initial studies indicated that St. John’s wort extract’s antidepressant action was based on the ability of crude hyper- icin preparations to inhibit both types A and B MAO.8,9 As a result of this inhibition, there is an increase in the level of neurotransmitters within the brain that maintain normal mood and emotional stability, including serotonin, catecholamines, and dopamine. These prelim- inary results identified hypericin as the supposed active constituent. However, later chemical analysis of these crude hypericin preparations identified the active content as being as much as 20% of St. John’s wort’s other constituents, with flavonoids being the most important.1 In other words, it is unknown to what extent hypericin or the flavo- noids individually really contribute to any MAO inhibition. A study was conducted to better understand the influence of hyper- icin, hypericum total extract, and hypericum fractions on the activ- ity of MAO.10 An inhibition of MAO was shown using the following concentrations: • Hypericin to 10−3 mol/L • Hypericum total extract to 10−4 mol/L • One extract fraction up to 10−5 mol/L The key result from this study, as well as in another in vitro/ex vivo study, was the demonstration that the concentrations of inhibition shown, particularly with regard to the inhibition of MAO activity, were likely insufficient to explain the clinically proven antidepressive effect of St. John’s wort extract.10,11 Therefore additional mechanisms are likely responsible for these clinical benefits. The same group also looked at effect on COMT and found no inhibition either.10

## Modulation of IL-6 Activity

The modulating effect of St. John’s wort extract on IL-6 is the most interesting, as it proposes a mechanism by which St. John’s wort inter- acts with the link between the immune system and mood. The cytokine IL-6 is heavily involved in the communication between cells within and outside the immune system. With regard to the nervous system, IL-6 is known to modulate hypothalamic-pituitary-end organ axes, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The hypothesis is that an elevation in IL-6 results in activation of the hypothalamic-pi- tuitary-adrenal axis, leading to elevations in corticotropin-releasing hormone and other adrenal regulatory hormones—hallmark features in depression. St. John’s wort extract showed an ability to reduce IL-6 levels; therefore this action may explain the clinical effectiveness of St. John’s wort extract.12 Animal studies comparing the effects of hypericum in mice who produce normal IL-6 levels versus IL-6 knockout mice (those with no IL-6 expression) found higher levels of serotonin produced in the former group.13 An in vitro study looked at blood in five healthy vol- unteers and four depressive patients. The release of IL-6, IL-1 β , and tumor necrosis factor- α was measured quantitatively after an incu- bation time of 24 hours on microtiter plates. A massive suppression of IL-6 release was found with samples exposed to phytohemaggluti- nin-stimulated St. John’s wort extract.12 If these effects can be dupli- cated in vivo, it would provide a mechanism by which St. John’s wort extract modulates release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and, subsequently, mood.

## Serotonin Reuptake Inhibition

St. John’s wort extract was also shown to inhibit the reuptake of sero- tonin in a similar fashion to drugs like fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxe- tine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). The study that demonstrated a 50% serotonin reuptake inhibition used the 0.3% hypericin content standardized extract at a concentration of 6.2 mg/mL and did not attempt to identify the active inhibitors. The authors of the study con- cluded that “the antidepressant activity of hypericum extract is due to inhibition of serotonin uptake by postsynaptic receptors.” However, results were conflicting with regard to the effect of acute doses of St. John’s wort extracts on the serotonergic system in rodents.14 A marked increase of both serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was reported in rat brain cortex. Other researchers reported high 5-HIAA and serotonin levels in the mouse hypothal- amus and hippocampus, but not in the cerebral cortex, where only 5-HIAA increased. However, other research found no significant changes in either serotonin or 5-HIAA after a schedule of treatment during the forced swimming test. One study of the rat locus coeruleus showed that systemic hyperforin induced a lasting and marked (100%– 200%) increase in the extracellular concentrations of serotonin, but not 5-HIAA.15

## Sigma 1-Receptor Activation and GABA Inhibition

There is growing research that St. John’s wort may affect function via Sigma 1 σ receptors and GABA receptors. σ receptors were shown to play an important role in antidepressive effects because selective σ1 -re- ceptor agonists, as well as typical antidepressants, reduced the immo- bility time in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests.16 Research demonstrated that the pretreatment of rats with St. John’s wort extracts or hyperforin trimethoxybenzoate could block other ligand binding to σ -receptors. The antidepressant-like activity of hyperforin trimethoxybenzoate was completely antagonized by pretreating rats with BD 1047, a selective σ1 antagonist. These results, together with the previous observation that agonists at σ1 receptors are active in anti- depressant models in rats, suggest that St. John’s wort’s antidepressant effects might be mediated in part by an indirect action on σ -recep- tors.14 Looking at lung vasculature in cats, St. John’s wort showed a GABA receptor vasodepressant effect.17 Other in vitro studies have also shown a GABA receptor inhibition by hypericum. This finding may indicate that GABA inhibition may also be partially responsible for its antidepressant action.

## Hypothalamic Gene Transcription

A fascinating study evaluated the effect of both St. John’s wort and antidepressant imipramine on gene transcription in the rat hypothal- amus. The depressed patient’s hypothalamus is known to manifest changes associated with food intake, decreased libido, and abnormal circadian rhythms. This research found a significant correlation of six genes directly modulated by both these test compounds. The proba- bility of this occurring by chance was 1.14 × 10−23. The functions of these specific genes include protein synthesis and degradation, cellular scaffolding and intracellular transport, mitochondrial and glycolytic energy metabolism, and cellular signaling through modulation of cal- cium-binding proteins. Although the implication of this research is not totally clear, the authors postulated that these modulated gene func- tions might be related to immune and inflammatory downregulation with neuronal protection from cellular injury.18 Amentoflavone, one of the many flavone contents in St. John’s wort, was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier by passive diffu- sion.19 This might account for the ability of this botanical to travel into the brain and affect CNS gene transcription. Nevertheless, one point regarding the probable synergistic effects of the St. John’s wort constituents should be underscored: given the multitude of active components in this botanical medicine, it is likely that syn- ergistic sites of action outside the CNS, in accordance with CNS effects, account for the complete and effective global actions of St. John’s wort.

## 673CHAPTER 88 Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort)

Extracts of St. John’s wort were tested in various animal models designed to study its antidepressant effects. In these studies, St. John’s wort extract was found to enhance the exploratory activity of mice in a foreign environment, extend the narcotic sleeping time in a dose- dependent fashion, antagonize the effects of reserpine, and decrease aggressive behavior in socially isolated male mice.20 These activities are consistent with the expected effects of antidepressant compounds and appear to be the result of increased monoamine activity.

## Antiviral Activity

In vitro studies showed that hypericin and pseudohypericin exhibit strong antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus I and II, as well as influenza types A and B and vesicular stomatitis virus.21 These compounds also demonstrated remarkable antiviral activity against Epstein-Barr virus.22 Researchers from New York University Medical Center and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel generated a tremendous amount of excitement when they demonstrated the antiretroviral activity of hypericin and pseudohypericin.23 This preliminary study examined the effect of these compounds on two animal retroviruses, Friend leukemia virus and radiation leukemia virus, both in vitro and in vivo (in mice). The researchers found the effective dose of hypericin in mice to be 1.5 to 2 mg/mL confirming the potency of a relatively small dose of this herbal extract. Two possible mechanisms were described to explain the antiviral activity of both hypericin and pseudohypericin.24 First was inhibi- tion of assembly or processing of intact virions from infected cells— released virions contain no detectable activity of reverse transcriptase. Second, these compounds also directly inactivate mature and properly assembled retroviruses. The antiviral activity of hypericin against HIV appears to require interaction with light to activate the hypericin.25,26 Another require- ment is sufficient concentrations, as entry of hypericin into infected cells depends on the concentration of hypericin in the blood. At sufficient concentrations, hypericin incubated with HIV-infected whole blood decreases culturable HIV, indicating significant antiviral activity.27

## Antibacterial Activity

St. John’s wort extracts have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The organisms studied included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.28

## Pharmacokinetic Studies

Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that hyperforin, as well as hypericin and pseudohypericin, have adequate absorption to produce serum lev- els that correspond to the levels showing benefit in in vitro studies.29 However, hyperforin is the only ingredient of H. perforatum that could be determined in the brains of rodents after oral administration of alcoholic extracts. This result and others seem to indicate that it may be the chief constituent responsible for the antidepressant effects of H. perforatum.


As the only truly recognized herbal treatment for the condition, St. John’s wort is most recognized for the treatment of depression. It can also be of benefit in the treatment of chronic viral infections, restless legs, and topically for various skin and pain conditions.


Extracts of St. John’s wort standardized for hypericin content (most studies used the 0.3% hypericin content extract) have significant support in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. The official German Commission E monograph for St. John’s wort lists psychoveg- etative disturbances, depressive states, fear, and nervous disturbances as clinical indications for St. John’s wort.30 St. John’s wort extract improved many psychological symptoms, including the following: • Depression • Anxiety • Apathy • Sleep disturbances • Insomnia • Anorexia • Feelings of worthlessness Even more impressive is that St. John’s wort extract was able to achieve these benefits without producing significant side effects. The history of meta-analyzing hypericum studies has been full of tumult and contradiction. One meta-analysis in 1996 of 23 random- ized trials included 1757 outpatients with mainly mild or moderately severe depressive symptoms. It showed that hypericum extracts were significantly superior to placebo and as effective as standard antide- pressants. This analysis revealed 0.8% dropouts for side effects with hypericum compared with 3.0% for standard antidepressant drugs. In this research, side effects occurred in 19.8% of patients on hypericum and 52.8% of patients on standard antidepressants.31 However, there were two well-publicized clinical studies claiming that hypericum was ineffective in treating depression.32 One 8-week trial employed suboptimal doses of hypericum, using 900 mg/day for patients with severe depression. If there was no response, doses were increased to only 1200 mg/day. In a previous severe depression study, patients improved significantly on hypericum, compared with pla- cebo and the antidepressant drug imipramine, on a dose of 1800 mg/ day.33,34 Given that the trial was funded by a company that manufac- tures antidepressant medications, and in light of a strong history of positive hypericum trials, it is doubtful that this accurately reflects the clinical ability of such a well-studied botanical. A second 8-week study from 2002 made a similar suboptimal dos- ing error, and subsequently deemed hypericum to be ineffective. A valuable note in this study was that the comparison drug, sertraline (with a much stronger side effect profile than hypericum), was not any more effective than hypericum or the placebo.35 The study generated considerable media attention as showing SJW is ineffective—ignoring or underplaying the other finding that the standard antidepressant was also ineffective. A third meta-analysis in 2008 included only trials from 1995 to 2006 that were randomized and double-blinded, involving patients with major depression. Extracts of hypericum were compared with placebo or standard antidepressants, including fluoxetine, sertraline, imipramine, citalopram, paroxetine, and amitriptyline. In all, 29 stud- ies involving 5489 patients were analyzed. Hypericum extracts tested in the trials were superior to placebo and equally effective as standard antidepressants. Patients given hypericum extracts dropped out of trials less frequently because of lower adverse effects than those given standard antidepressants. It was concluded that the results “imply that an attempt of treating mild to moderate major depression with one of the hypericum preparations positively tested in clinical trials is clearly justified,” but added that evidence was “still insufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy of hypericum for treating severe major depression.” The authors cited that the mild physical side effects associated with hypericum might be enhancing the placebo effect. A second concern was that hypericum was popular in Germany, so the more robust effects in the studies from German-speaking coun- tries might be attributable to an “allegiance” effect. A third concern was that, although positive, the larger-scale trials used in the analysis

produced overall smaller effects.36 Another meta-analysis published in 2016 was consistent with past reviews. This review of randomized con- trolled trials examined 35 studies, evaluating a total of 6993 patients looking at hypericum extracts including 0.3% hypericin and 1% to 4% hyperforin. The herb exhibited over 50% greater response compared with placebo, with an effect at least as good as antidepressants and with significantly fewer adverse events.37 Hypericum has been compared head-to-head with leading anti- depressant medications multiple times.38,39 In an example random- ized, controlled, double-blind trial, 70 patients with mild to moderate depression received one tablet of either hypericum extract or fluox- etine twice a day for 6 weeks. As evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), the von Zerssen depression scale (DS), and patients’ response, there were significant decreases (P <0.001) in symptoms in the St. John’s wort group (50%) and in the fluoxetine group (58%) on their HAMD scores. The hypericum extract achieved 83% of the efficacy of fluoxetine on the HAMD and 78% on the DS. Assessments by physicians and patients indicated considerable improvement with no between-treatment differences.38 The authors concluded that the hypericum tested in this study was therapeutically equivalent to fluoxetine and that it was a reasonable alternative to syn- thetic antidepressants. Another recent meta-analysis of St. John’s wort reviewed 27 clinical trials with a total of 3808 patients comparing the use of St. John’s wort and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. Study durations varied from a 4- to 12-week period, and revealed St. John’s wort had comparable efficacy. Even more, there was also a significantly lower discontinuation and dropout rate compared with the drugs. Safety compared with SSRIs showed significantly lower discontinua- tion of the herb.40 Hypericum extract was similarly tested and proven at least as effec- tive as sertraline in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in a small group of outpatients.39 Efficacy and tolerability of hypericum extract was also compared with imipramine and was found equivalent to the drug in treating mild to moderate depression. In addition, as expected, patients tolerated the hypericum better.41 Although preliminary, St. John’s wort may be a safe recommenda- tion during pregnancy and postpartum depression (see “Pregnancy” and “Nursing” for more information). St. John’s wort has also been studied in children. Three open-label trials in depressed children found benefit with minimal side effects. The first study of 101 children, less than 12 years of age, were administered 300 to 1800 mg/day at a standardized dose of 900 mcg hypericin.42 A second, 8-week open- label trial in 33 youths from 6 to 16 years of age used a dose of 150 to 900 mg/day, and enjoyed an 80% response rate.43 A third trial of adolescents given 300 mg three times a day had an 82% response rate in the 11 patients who completed the study. However, in this study, patients withdrew either because of noncompliance or worsening of symptomology.44,45

## Seasonal Affective Disorder

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) represents a subgroup of major depression with a regular occurrence of symptoms in autumn/win- ter and full remission in spring/summer (see Chapter 142 Affective Disorders for more discussion). Light therapy has become the stan- dard treatment for this type of depression. Apart from this, pharmaco- therapy with antidepressants also seems to provide an improvement of SAD symptoms.46 SAD patients with major depression were random- ized in a 4-week treatment study with 900 mg/day of St. John’s wort extract (0.3% hypericin content) combined with either bright (3000 lux; n = 10) or dim light (less than 300 lux therapy). The significant reduction in the Hamilton Depression Scale in both groups (72% and 60%, respectively) indicated that St. John’s wort extract might benefit patients with SAD as a sole therapeutic agent, as well as in combination with light therapy.

## Insomnia

St. John’s wort was shown to improve sleep quality and well-being in healthy elderly subjects.47 With antidepressant drugs, particularly tri- cyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors, rapid eye movement sleep is reduced. St. John’s wort did not interfere with rapid eye movement sleep like other antidepressants and was shown to increase the inten- sity of deep sleep during the total sleeping period as demonstrated by brainwave studies. Although St. John’s wort improved sleep quality, it did not act as a sedative (i.e., it did not reduce sleep onset), nor did it change total sleep duration.

## Mental Function

One of the most interesting comparative studies was a double-blind study in which St. John’s wort extract (0.3% hypericin content) was compared with maprotiline in 24 healthy volunteers by measuring rest- ing brainwave (electroencephalography) tracings and mental activity (visual and acoustic evoked potentials).48 Interpretation of the differ- ences in reactions indicated that, unlike maprotiline, which interferes with mental function, St. John’s wort actually improved memory and other mental activities. Long-term administration of St. John’s wort in rats improved learning and spatial memory with significant changes in the content of monoamines in several brain regions.49

## Infections

St. John’s wort may be of value in the treatment of AIDS. In response to in vitro and animal studies, many AIDS patients began self-admin- istering St. John’s wort where patients reported feeling better with a more positive outlook, more energy, and less fatigue.50,51 Hypericum seems to suppresses HIV-1 expression and inhibits its replication.52 A St. John’s wort protein called P27SJ has also been shown to minimize HIV-1 induced neurotoxicity in the brain by inhibiting viral replica- tion and calming inflammatory response.53 Small studies looking at AZT treatment with St. John’s showed modest T-cell count increases of 13% from baseline. Another open pilot study of 18 HIV patients showed stable or even increasing counts of absolute T-helper cells over the 40 months, with lowered opportunistic infections54 (for further information about HIV/AIDS, see Chapter 173).55,56 St. John’s wort may have negative reaction with protease inhibitor drugs and simulta- neous use with HIV medications should be avoided. Research suggests that St. John’s wort may be a useful adjunctive treatment for herpes simplex, mononucleosis, and influenza, although further human studies are necessary to establish the optimal dosage of the standardized extract. Combined with its antidepressant activity, St. John’s wort also appears to be a promising treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome.

## Restless Legs Syndrome

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, was treated with a low dose (300 mg qd) of St. John’s wort extract in patients with a concentrated extract for 3 months. Seventeen of these patients found significant relief. Researchers suggested it decreased thyroid levels by increasing thyroid hormone degradation through the CYP3A4 enzyme isoform and, perhaps, by increasing stimulates the expression of P-glycoprotein.57

## 675CHAPTER 88 Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort)

hyperforin encourages growth and differentiation of keratinocytes, while hypericin acts as a photosensitizer that can be employed for selective treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer.58 St. John’s wort preparations have also been used in burns, as a sunscreen, and in the treatment of muscular pain.3 Oil-based preparations are preferred for topical applications.


The dosages of St. John’s wort preparations are based on their hyper- icin content. The overwhelming majority of the studies in depression used St. John’s wort extract standardized to contain 0.3% hypericin and 3% to 5% hyperforin. This extract is produced via an extraction with 80% methanol (which is subsequently removed). Although hypericin and hyperforin are key components, this extract is com- posed of a wide range of compounds constituting the remaining 95% of the extract. Manufacturers of these standardized extracts employ high-performance liquid chromatography techniques to identify not only the hypericin, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin, but also related compounds, flavonoid components, xanthones, cinnamic acid, and several other key components. The point is that although the dosage is based on hypericin levels, assuring appropriate levels of these other constituents is also vitally important. Dosing of three times a day is recommended because of its short half-life. To achieve the benefits noted in the clinical trials, it is dif- ficult to recommend any other forms beyond standardized extracts. Nonetheless, here are dosage recommendations for various forms of St. John’s wort: • Dried flowers: 2 to 4 g three times a day • Tincture (1:5): 3 to 6 mL three times a day • Fluid extract (1:1): 1 to 2 mL three times a day • Standardized solid (dry-powdered) extract (0.3% hypericin and 3%–5% hyperforin): 900 to 1800 mg a day

# SAFETY/TOXICITY

Although the conventional medical community focuses on concerns for herbal and natural remedies in terms of safety, a balanced look at botanicals suggests both benefits and risk. Looking at St. John’s wort, there seems to be an exemplary beneficial profile and definite concerns in terms of photosensitivity and drug interactions. There are also some beneficial drug interactions to consider. The literature on pregnancy and breast feeding suggests possible safety, but there is not enough lit- erature to be clear. The side effect profile of hypericum extract is minor, and is safer compared with the well-known side effects of antidepressant med- ications.59 Also notable, there seems to be no memory impairment, an advantage for senior patients over conventional drugs.60 St. John’s wort also seems to be less toxic on the wallet: an Australian group stud- ied the economic effects of St. John’s wort versus antidepressants, and found the herbal remedy to have reduced cost profile compared with generic antidepressants with advantages as a result of its low incidence of adverse effects.61

## Serotonin Syndrome Concern

A main concern in the literature is regarding excessive levels of sero- tonin called “serotonin syndrome” where symptoms can include men- tal status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia and incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal tract symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). Severe cases can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instabil- ity with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. An example of this was reported in a study of four elderly patients who ostensibly developed serotonin syndrome as a result of an interaction between tramadol and mirtazapine.62 Although polyphar- macy of antidepressants caused this syndrome, no reports of natural substances causing this syndrome have been reported to date. Because its action on serotonin is minor at best, it is unlikely that hypericum would cause this syndrome. Nevertheless, monitoring is prudent when working with hypericum, and serotonin precursors tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan along with SSRIs. There are case reports linking St. John’s wort to mania, suggesting it may not be a good choice for bipolar disorder.63

## Photosensitivity

Although hypericum was demonstrated to induce photosensitivity in some patients (less than 1% of people taking 900 mg once a day or more), this is not likely with standard dosages. Cases of photosensitiv- ity occurred mainly in HIV patients using higher than normal quan- tities for an antiviral effect.56 Because of the photosensitivity concern, avoidance of strong sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light when using St. John’s wort is often recommended to individuals, especially those with fair skin. However, although this recommendation may be appropriate, it must be pointed out that the therapeutic dosage of 2.7 mg/day of hypericin is about 30 to 50 times below the level found to produce phototoxicity.64

<!-- chunk -->

## Pregnancy

Despite the ample research on St. John’s wort, relatively little research has focused on safety in pregnancy and breast feeding. Animal preg- nancy toxicology studies showed no change in maternal weight gain or gestational length65 and no change in offspring anomaly rates.66,67 These negative animal studies can be reassuring because they suggest a lack of structural or functional deficits attributable to hypericum expo- sure during gestation.68 However, we must always keep in mind that rodents and humans have varying detoxification abilities. Human studies are few. In 1998 there were reports of two women who took hypericum during their pregnancies to avoid using conven- tional synthetic medications. Both cases seemed to reveal no concerns. One of these cases was of a 38-year-old woman who started hyperi- cum at 24 weeks’ gestation. The pregnancy was unremarkable, with the exception of late onset of thrombocytopenia (which the author did not attribute to hypericum). The offspring was born healthy, had a normal birth weight, normal APGAR scores, and physical examination and laboratory results were normal. Infant behavioral assessment at and 23 days was normal.69 One 2006 review by naturopathic physicians looked at the evi- dence on the use, safety, and pharmacology of hypericum. This review searched seven databases, including the Cochrane bases, MedLine, Natural Database, and Natural Standard. Some unpublished research and bibliographies were also included. Data were compiled according to grade of evidence. The researchers found varying levels of scientific evidence. They concluded that there was in vitro evidence from ani- mal studies that hypericum during pregnancy does not affect cognitive development or cause long-term behavioral defects but found some evidence of lower offspring birth weight. It is important to remember that rodents have very different detoxification abilities, and extrap- olation to humans may not be prudent. This review also pointed to weak scientific evidence that hypericum induced CYP450 enzymes, which may lower serum medication levels below therapeutic range, which would be of concern when administering medications during pregnancy. The authors concluded that caution is warranted with the

use of hypericum during pregnancy until further high-quality human research is conducted to determine its safety.70 The first study of hypericum looking to determine whether expo- sure could be associated with major malformations prospectively followed 54 subjects using hypericum and compared them with a matched group of 108 pregnant women taking other pharmacological therapy for depression, as well as a third group of healthy women, who were not exposed to any known teratogens. The study showed that malformation rates were similar across the three groups, with 5%, 4%, and 0% in hypericum, pharmaceutical subjects, and healthy groups, respectively. This was not different than the 3% to 5% risk expected in the general population. Live birth and prematurity rates were also not different among the three groups. The authors suggested this first human study on pregnancy the did provide some evidence of fetal safety.71 More studies are very welcome.

## Nursing

Albeit in its own infancy, studies using hypericum during breast feeding are starting to support its use and safety for depressed mood in moth- ers while breast feeding. Animal studies using doses up to 25 times the equivalent recommended human dose throughout lactation did not show any neurobehavioral or developmental effects in offspring.65 One study evaluating the safety of St. John’s wort while nursing studied breast-feeding women over a 2-year period. Compared with 101 dis- ease-matched and 33 age-matched controls, there were no statistically significant differences found in maternal or infant demographics or maternal adverse events. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of maternal report of decreased milk production among the groups, nor was a difference found in infant weight over the first year of life.72 A review of multiple databases also suggested that hypericum consumption during lactation did not affect maternal milk produc- tion or infant weight, but could cause colic, drowsiness, or lethargy. The authors of this review concluded that hypericum use during lac- tation appeared to be of minimal risk but could cause some mild side effects.70 St. John’s wort may be a choice if other natural recommen- dations are not sufficient for the lactating female, although more data would be welcome to confirm safety.


Historically, those taking St. John’s wort have been advised to avoid foods and medications that are known to interact with MAO- inhibiting drugs (such as tyramine-containing foods like cheeses, beer, wine, pickled herring, and yeast). In addition, drugs such as l-dopa and SSRIs were categorically recommended to avoid. However, given recent research demonstrating the lack of in vivo MAO inhibition, this recommendation is no longer justified. Strong evidence warrants precaution when combining St. John’s wort with several pharmaceutic therapies. St. John’s wort was found to decrease the plasma concentrations of alprazolam, amitriptyline, digoxin, cyclosporine, indinavir, irinotecan, methadone, nevirapine, simvastatin, tacrolimus, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, and oral contraceptives. In the case of cyclosporine, the interaction resulted in some transplantation graft rejections. Hypericum was also shown to decrease the bioavailability of the R and S forms of verapamil.73,74 When combined with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepres- sants (e.g., sertraline, paroxetine, nefazodone), or buspirone, hyper- icum can theoretically contribute to “serotonergic syndrome,” a syndrome caused by excess serotonin levels. This syndrome has been iatrogenically induced by psychotropic and nonpsychotropic pharma- ceutic coadministration and may include symptoms such as agitation, confusion, severe shivering, diaphoresis, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, mydriasis, tachycardia, and fever.75 Women on oral contraception should be informed regarding the possible decrease in birth control efficacy with hypericum. St. John’s wort causes an induction of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone metabolism consistent with increased CYP3A activity and can contrib- ute to intracyclic bleeding.76 One study evaluated the use of St. John’s wort and oral contraception. St. John’s wort appeared to contribute to breakthrough bleeding in 7 of 12 women (vs. 2 of 12 women in the oral contraception alone group). When taking oral contraceptive pills with St. John’s wort, women may experience breakthrough bleeding and should consider adding a barrier method of contraception.77 Although there is great concern for negative effects on drug metabo- lism, hypericum is now being studied for its positive effects on medication outcomes as well. One study using the platelet inhibitor clopidogrel found that 2 of 10 patients using clopidogrel were poor responders but use of 300 mg hypericum for 2 weeks in these patients resulted in an increase in platelet inhibition of 20%. A previous study using 300 mg three times daily demonstrated an increase of 36%. Furthermore, no negative changes were seen in patients on statin medications.78 Hypericum may be a good choice in poor responders, or to help lower the dose necessary in nor- mal responders experiencing side effects. A small open trial of 20 patients looked at concomitant use of metformin alone (1 gram) on glucose toler- ance and insulin action compared with using with the herb. There was no apparent effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin, save for a minor renal clearance reduction of the medication.79

## Central Nervous System Effects

One of the more promising lines of research with lobeline is that it appears to disrupt the fundamental mechanisms of dopamine storage and release. This action may help in antagonizing the neurochem- ical and behavioral effects of the psychostimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine. Lobeline was found to inhibit the amphet- amine-induced release of dopamine in vitro and amphetamine- induced hyperactivity, drug discrimination, and self-administration in animal experiments.7,8 Because lobeline is not addictive itself, it may reduce the abuse liability of these psychostimulants.


Lobelia is primarily used as an expectorant in such conditions as pneu- monia, asthma, and bronchitis. It appears that some of its actions may be mediated by the adrenal cortex.9 Experimentally induced lung edema in rats was responsive to lobeline in many models that were unresponsive to any other medication. Furthermore, although lobeline causes bronchoconstriction in dogs and rats, in guinea pigs and (pre- sumably) humans, the opposite—bronchodilation—occurs.10 Although effective when used alone in the treatment of asthma, it has traditionally been used in combination with other botanical agents, including Capsicum frutescens and Symphlocarpus factida. Lobelia has also been used as an aid in stopping smoking with equivocal results from clinical trials.11


• Dried herb: 0.2 to 0.6 g three times a day • Tincture: 15 to 30 drops three times a day • Fluid extract: 8 to 10 drops three times a day


Although lobelia has a reputation for being toxic, a thorough review of the medical literature was unable to find any well-documented case of serious problems or death caused by lobelia.12 The main reason may be that lobe- lia causes nausea and vomiting when the amount used is too high, thereby avoiding absorption of toxic amounts. In general, a dosage of more than 1 mL of tincture one time is enough to produce significant nausea and possibly vomiting. Lobelia should not be used for more than 1 month consecutively and should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Like nicotine poisoning, toxic symptoms of lobelia include the following: • Nausea • Salivation • Diarrhea • Disturbed hearing and vision • Mental confusion • Marked weakness Faintness and prostration ensue; blood pressure falls; the pulse becomes weak, rapid, and irregular; breathing is difficult; and collapse occurs, followed by convulsions. Death may conceivably result from respiratory failure. The antidote in acute poisoning is 2 mg of atropine, which is given subcutaneously.


There are no known drug interactions with lobelia.

make chitinase and cannot use chitin for anything other than nondigest- ible fiber. Chitin can be broken down by different processing techniques, including heat. Once this is performed, the mannan and beta-glucan lay- ers can be used as medicine. From an immunological perspective, these layers are considered pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and bind to pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on cells in the innate immune system—macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. The majority of binding occurs in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where Peyer’s patches contain cells of the innate immune system. Specific receptors that bind these β -glucans include dectin-1 and TLR-2.3 Binding has a hormetic effect, creating a stress response in the immune system, stimulating the release of cytokines with anti-inflamma- tory, proinflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer activity. These cytokines stimulate an increase in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells—overall, generating a stress signal leading to a more primed immune system.

## Blood Sugar Regulation

Polysaccharides inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which is known to participate in the rise in blood sugar after a meal. Additionally, poly- saccharides have also been shown to upregulate GLUT 4, an insulin-re- sponse glucose transporter, while downregulating NF- κ B, a nuclear transcription factor that regulates inflammation.4-6

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant

Polysaccharides increase the activity of hepatic oxidative enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, effec- tively increasing levels of glutathione and decreasing malondialdehyde levels (a marker of lipid peroxidation). Generally, these compounds support the innate antioxidant systems in relieving oxidative stress and free radical damage.7

<!-- chunk -->

## Prebiotic

The oligosaccharides and polysaccharides contained in mushrooms are consumed by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, two important bacteria in a healthy microbiome.4,8,9

<!-- chunk -->

## Triterpenoids

As the mushroom matures from primordia to fruiting body, the enzyme CYP450 stimulates synthesis of triterpenes (Fig. 90.2); therefore, there are more of these compounds found in the fruiting bodies of mushrooms. The triterpenes are commonly lanostane triterpenes and may be referred to as “lanostanoids.” Triterpenes are major compounds of interest in can- cer research because they have been shown to be directly cytotoxic to many cancer cell lines.10-14 They also have specific antiviral activity through inhibi- tion of the enzyme, neuraminidase.15-17 These compounds are also benefi- cial in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including allergy, asthma, dermatitis, and rhinitis by inhibiting histamine release from mast cells.10

## Phenolic Compounds

Phenolic compounds are the building blocks for pigments in mush- rooms, and once absorbed in the small intestine, they act as antioxi- dant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral agents. The most well researched phenolic compounds among mushrooms are hispolon (Fig. 90.3) and phelligridin, both found in Phellinus spp. and Inonotus obliquus.18-20

## Ergosterol

Ergosterol (Fig. 90.4) is as ubiquitous in mushrooms as cholesterol is in humans. It is formed by an almost identical metabolic process— the mevalonate pathway. When mushrooms are exposed to ultraviolet light, ergosterol is converted to ergocalciferol, or vitamin D 2 . Vitamin D 2 is then converted to calcidiol in the liver and eventually calcitriol, active vitamin D 3 , in the kidneys. There is clinical evidence to show that ergocalciferol-D2, although not as bioavailable as calcitriol-D3, could significantly improve vitamin D deficiency in human patients.21 However, as many of the metabolic activities of vitamin D 2 are differ- ent from the vitamin D 3 produced in the skin of mammals, they should not be used interchangeably.

## Ergothioneine

Ergothioneine (ERG; Fig. 90.5) is an amino acid derivative, a crystal- line betaine, derived from histidine. The ERG transporter, OCTN1 (gene: SLC22A4)22 is found on erythrocytes, fetal liver and bone mar- row, ileum of the small intestine, trachea, kidney, cerebellum, lung, monocytes, seminal vesicles, and the lens and cornea of the eye.23 Interestingly, OCTN1 is concentrated in the mitochondria, suggest- ing a role in protecting mitochondrial components from DNA dam- age.23,24 When cells are depleted of OCTN1, they are more susceptible to oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial damage, protein oxida- tion, and lipid peroxidation. After ingestion, whether as an isolated molecule or in a whole mushroom, ERG is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it is highly bioavailable, and retained for up to a month. In a human trial observ- ing ERG bioavailability, subjects consumed either 8 g or 16 g of mush- rooms, and increases in red blood cell (RBC) ERG were observed. After 1 and 4 hours of consumption, the 16 g mushroom dose increased RBC ERG concentration compared with the control, and after 2 hours, RBC ERG concentration was significantly higher than the control.25 ERG chelates divalent metal cations: copper, mercury, zinc, cad- mium, cobalt, iron, and nickel.26-28 Cation binding may help prevent their participation in the generation of reactive oxygen species; for example, ERG has been found to protect DNA and protein against copper induced oxidative damage through formation of a redox-inac- tive EGT-Cu complex. ERG enhances glutathione activity in rat liver cytosol in a dose dependent manner, leading researchers to postulate that declining ERG may play a role in age-related decline of glutathione and glutathi- one peroxidase. Furthermore, ERG levels are lower in the elderly with early stages of dementia and in Parkinson’s disease patients relative to age-matched healthy controls.29 Of all the mushrooms analyzed, ERG was highest in the fruiting body of Pleurotus ostreatus (Oyster Mushroom), containing 26.4 mg per 85 g mushroom.30

## Antigout. Ganoderma spp. decrease uric acid accumulation

through multiple mechanisms. In vitro, 2, 5 Dihydroxacetophenone, a bioactive compound from G. applanatum, and lanostanoids from G. tsugae bind to and decrease xanthine oxidase activity.31,32 Significantly, xanthine oxidase is the terminal enzyme in the formation of uric acid. In an animal model, ethanol and water extracts of G. applanatum were administered to hyperuricemic mice, and the extracts lowered serum uric acid levels and increased both mRNA and protein levels of organic anion transporter (OAT1), which induced uric acid excretion. Additionally, renal uric acid reabsorption was blocked through inhibition of glucose transporter 9 (GLUT 9) and uric acid transporter 1(URAT1).33

## Antiandrogenic. In vitro research and animal studies suggest that

Reishi exhibits antiandrogenic effects via inhibition of the enzyme 5- α -reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, an androgen hormone that is correlated with benign prostatic hyperplasia in older men. Fruiting body preparations of the mushroom significantly inhibited the growth of the ventral prostate in rats, and decreased levels of prostate specific antigen.34-36 The ethanol extract of G. lucidum fruiting body containing ganoderol B and ganoderic acid DM was found to bind androgen receptors, inhibiting androgen induced lymph node carcinoma of the prostate as well as inhibiting 5-alpha reductase, respectively.36

## Antiatherogenic. Lipid peroxidation of low-density lipopro-

teins (LDL) particles in the macrovasculature is a major contribu- tor to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Animal studies have demonstrated the antiatherogenic effects of G. lucidum polysaccha- rides, revealing that after administration, treated rats had decreased levels of triglycerides and LDL-c, lower liver weight, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-c, serum superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase compared with the control.37 Other studies have explored beneficial cardiovascular effects via the quenching of free radicals that are responsible for lipid peroxidation; it is postu- lated that the antioxidant triterpenoids may be responsible for this effect.38

inhibit aldose reductase and alpha-glucosidase, two essential enzymes in the treatment of hyperglycemia.39 G. lucidum also contains a protein, LZ-8, that demonstrates immunomodulatory and antitype 1 diabetes activity via decreasing lymphocyte infiltration and increasing antibody detection of insulin in pancreatic β -cells. Some studies have found that this immunomodulatory action is a result of LZ-8 stimulating FOXP3 regulatory T cells,40 indicating a possible benefit for other autoimmune disease.

## Antineoplastic. G. applanatum triterpenoids and polyketids

have anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo in animal models. These triterpenoid compounds are anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and have overall cytotoxic effects via upregulation of caspase-3 and increased P53 tumor suppressor gene expression.41 In vitro, triterpenoids extracted from G. lucidum ganoderic acids have a number of anticancer actions that have been observed in cervical, breast, liver, lymphoma, melanoma, leukemia, lung, and colon cancers, including cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity, inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis via caspase-3, suppression of cell adhesion, inhibition of angiogenesis, and inhibition of migration and invasion.42,43

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiviral. Ganoderma triterpenoids also pose antiviral effects

in vitro to H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses via inhibition of neuraminidase enzymes.44 In addition to the antiviral terpenes, water soluble compounds exhibit antiviral activity; specifically, the hot water extract of G. lucidum significantly inhibits plaque formation of HSV-2.45


<!-- chunk -->

## Antiandrogenic. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-

controlled and dose ranging study, G. lucidum was administered at a dose of 6 mg per day to men with lower urinary tract symptoms caused by prostate hyperplasia. Extracts of G. lucidum at this dose were found to be safe and effective in relieving urinary symptoms in men with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction.46

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. Ganoderma polysaccharide, “Ganopoly,” pos-

itively modulates the immune function of advanced stage cancer patients with lung, breast, colon, liver, or prostate cancer. Patients were treated with 1800 mg of ‘Ganopoly’ three times a day orally before meals for 12 weeks (5.4 g of isolated Ganopoly is equivalent to 30 g of fruiting body per day), resulting in an increase in interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, and interferon γ (IFN- γ ), while significantly decreasing IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α ). Additionally, there was a significant increase in mean natural killer (NK) cell activity compared with base- line.47 Taken together, these findings suggest an immunomodulatory effect that could be of great benefit as an adjunct therapy in cancer treatment.

## Antiviral. A human study found the combination of G. lucidum

and T. versicolor at 400 mg/day for 2 months cleared oral human papilloma virus in 87.8% of cases compared with the control, which only cleared 5% of cases.48

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic fatigue syndrome. Female volunteers with chronic fatigue

syndrome receiving 2 g of G. lucidum extract daily had a significant benefit in quality-of-life parameters compared with the control group. Average serum cortisol level, measured 12 weeks after the first dose, was increased up to 1.5 times from baseline measurement, leading the authors to conclude that women with chronic fatigue syndrome who generally have low cortisol levels can benefit from Reishi intake, and may also see a rise in serum cortisol.49

## Cordyceps (C. sinensis, C. militaris, Caterpillar fungus,

<!-- chunk -->

## dong chong xia cao,

<!-- chunk -->

## 冬虫夏草

<!-- chunk -->

## )


Cordyceps is an extraordinary mushroom and is considered an endoparasite—the mycelium takes over the life of insects, zombifies them, and grows an erect fruiting body, usually through the caput of an arthropod. According to ancient descriptions, C. sinensis possesses important pharmacological activities for protecting lung and kidney function and nourishes essential and vital energy. The Nepalese people observed livestock consuming Cordyceps and saw an increase in the animal’s sexual vitality and general stamina. The people then began to consume the mushrooms as the other animals did and found that it improved their own vitality as well— increasing stamina, endurance, and treating impotence.

<!-- chunk -->

## 683CHAPTER 90 Medicinal Mushrooms


<!-- chunk -->

## Renal protective. C. sinensis significantly improves tubuloint-

erstitial renal fibrosis, in vitro,51 and polysaccharide extracts relieve the formation of reactive oxygen species and reduce kidney damage through inhibition of tumor growth factor β (TGF- β ).52

<!-- chunk -->

## Endurance. Though used widely by athletes, few ergogenic

mechanisms have been demonstrated through in vivo animal models. Cordyceps spp. have been shown to stimulate the enzyme lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), accelerating the removal of lactic acid and increasing available adenosine triphosphate for anaerobic exercise.53 Cordyceps spp. also contain the nucleoside “adenosine,”54 which in exercise relaxes vascular smooth muscle, contributing to the local vasodilation that accompanies muscle contraction. Studies have found that during exercise-induced, higher-frequency contractions, adenosine contributes around 14% to 29% of the necessary vasodilation.55

<!-- chunk -->

## Respiratory protection. C. sinensis may be beneficial for

decreasing smoking-related cellular damage in lung tissue. In vitro research shows that Cordyceps decreases cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cellular senescence. Activation of the oxidative, inflammatory, and oncogene signaling pathway iROS/PI3K/AKT/ mTOR is enhanced by CSE treatment, and decreases when C. sin- ensis is administered.56 Cordycepin, a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine, significantly reduces airway inflammatory cell infiltration via inhibition of ERK/NF- κ B signaling pathway, which suppresses inflammatory mediators.57-61 Cordyceps inhibits airway remodel- ing of asthma by downregulating TGF- β and suppressing p38MAPK signaling pathways, which indicates possible use as a treatment for allergic asthma.62

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. Cordycepin has been widely recognized for its

therapeutic potential against many types of cancers through numerous mechanisms, inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and causing DNA damage in cancer cells, thereby killing cancer cells and controlling growth. Cordycepin also induces autophagy, inhibits tumor metastasis, and modulates the immune system. Although there have been many successful cases of cordycepin in anticancer research in vitro and in animal models, clinical trials have yet to be reported.63 Cordycepin also reduces migration of human glioblastoma cells in vitro and decreases brain tumor size in mice, and actively downregulates the expression of integrin β 1, FAK, and p-FAK, subsequently reducing cancer cell migration.64

<!-- chunk -->

## Erectile dysfunction. Cordyceps has a history of use as an aphro-

disiac, specifically aiding sexual endurance and erectile dysfunction. Studies indicate this mechanism is via a protein with vasorelaxant effects linked to the production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). These are preliminary results and the authors stress that fur- ther work on the mechanism of action is necessary.65


<!-- chunk -->

## Exercise recovery. A double-blind placebo-controlled trial

assessed the oxidative stress biomarkers in athletes supplementing with Cordyceps and Reishi mushrooms. The researchers found that after 3 months of supplementation with 1335 mg Cordyceps extract and 1170 mg Reishi extract per day, the athletes had significantly more free radical scavenging activity after a race than the placebo group.54 These results could be an indication that these mushrooms are also beneficial for recovery after endurance exercise.

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic kidney disease. In a review of 22 studies that involved

1746 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis, Cordyceps preparations were found to significantly decrease serum creatinine, an important marker of CKD severity. Cordyceps preparation, as an adjunctive therapy to conventional medicine, can decrease serum creatinine, increase creatinine clearance, reduce proteinuria, and alleviate CKD-associated complications, such as increased hemoglobin and serum albumin.66 Another systematic review compared 3 to 12 g daily doses of Cordyceps-based immunosuppressant therapy with azathio- prine-based immunosuppressant therapy. Both immunosuppressant therapies included cyclosporine A and prednisolone. Patients who took the Cordyceps-based immunosuppressant therapy had signifi- cantly lower blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, decreased serum uric acid, total cholesterol, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase liver enzymes, and increased HDL-cholesterol. Urinary leukocytes and erythrocytes were notably lower in the Cordyceps group along with lower infection rates. Based on these studies, Cordyceps is a safe adjunctive treatment that could be beneficial for patients with CKD.67

## Immune-stimulating. A placebo-controlled trial observed the

immune-stimulating effects of C. militaris fruiting body extract in healthy adult males: 1.5 g of mushroom was administered daily, and blood was drawn after 2 weeks and after 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, there was a significant increase in NK cells, IFN- γ , and IL-2 compared with the control group.68

## Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor, Coriolus versicolor,

<!-- chunk -->

## Kawaratake, Yun Zhi, 云芝)


In traditional Chinese medicine, Turkey Tail is called Cloud Fungus. It is said to replenish essence and qi, and regulate immune function. Traditionally, it was used to invigorate the spleen and eliminate damp- ness, arrest cough, and help with breathing difficulty (Fig. 90.8).

<!-- chunk -->

## Fig. 90.8 Trametes versicolor.

<!-- chunk -->

## 684SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines


The majority of research that has been done on Turkey Tail has been focused on polysaccharide krestin (PSK) and polysaccharide peptide (PSP).

<!-- chunk -->

## Gut microbiome. Turkey Tail has demonstrated prebiotic-like

activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro research has shown that the fermentation of PSP extract by gut bacteria increases the beneficial bacteria Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. while reducing less desirable bacteria, Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. This study also saw an increased level of lactate and beneficial short-chain fatty acids.70

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. PSK extract modulates the immune response

through stimulation of both extracellular PRR (TLR2) and intracellular pathogen sensors (NLRP3 inflammasome).71 There have been many peer-reviewed publications on Turkey Tail in cancer treatment, including 37 in vitro articles, 55 animal studies, 43 published human clinical studies, and 11 review articles in gastrointestinal, breast, and lung cancer. In the past 2 years, five more PSK trials in colorectal cancer have been published. Trametes water extract is made up of 62% polysaccharide and 38% PSK. After ingestion, PSK is highly bioavailable and can be found in the bone marrow, salivary gland, brain, liver, spleen, and pancreas in mice and rabbits within 24 hours. Once absorbed, PSK induces cytokine modulation, increasing TNF- α , IFN- γ , IL-2, and IL-8.72


<!-- chunk -->

## Microbiome. In a preclinical trial with 21 women, PSP gel was

administered intravaginally. There was improved epithelialization of the cervical mucosa and the concentration of Lactobacillus increased 54.5% while the pH decreased from 4.2 to 4.09.9 In a randomized clinical trial, 1200 mg of PSP was administered three times a day on an empty stomach alongside the antibiotic amox- icillin. Although amoxicillin alone led to an increase in Escherichia and Shigella, the PSP group had distinctive positive changes in the human microbiome, consistent with its activity as a prebiotic.73

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. PSK improves immune function, reduced

tumor-associated symptoms, and extended survival time in lung cancer patients. In six randomized controlled trials, 3 g a day of PSK or PSP alongside standard chemotherapy showed benefit for immune function, performance status and body weight, and overall survival. PSK increases immune surveillance and offsets chemotherapy-induced bone marrow toxicity, and reduces depression of immune cells and immune cell activity during chemotherapy. PSK also increases NK cells and phagocytic activity, reduces TGF- β , and increases the antitumor response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.74 In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial exploring pal- liative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, Turkey Tail was given as a standard, continuous daily dose of 2.4 g. These patients reported better physical, emotional, cognitive, and social functions compared with the placebo during treatment. They experienced higher cognitive function, less pain and increased appetite, and had reduced IL-17 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.75 In a Phase I clinical trial of T. versicolor in women with breast can- cer, researchers found that up to 9 g per day of a Turkey Tail prepa- ration is safe and tolerable and the women taking 6 g a day had a significant trend upward in NK cell counts.76

## Chaga (Inonotus obliquus, Kabanoanatake)


Chaga sclerotium has been used as medicine in Eastern Europe at least since the 12th century. Historical accounts suggest that a Russian duke, Vladimis Monomach, cured himself of lip cancer using Chaga. The Khanty people, an ethnic group from Siberia, used this mushroom as medicine for digestive ailments and to prevent heart and liver dis- ease. Chaga sclerotium grows out from the core of old birch trees, and consequently has medicinal compounds, betulin and betulinic acid, derived from these trees.


The triterpenoid compounds extracted from Chaga inhibit prolif- eration of cancer cells, induce cell cycle arrest at various cell cycle checkpoints, enhance apoptosis, and enhance regulation of signal transduction pathways.77 The triterpene inotodiol, specifically, has been shown to have an antihistamine effect via the inhibition of mast cell degranulation in the small intestine when administered to mice with food allergies.78

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant. The polysaccharides extracted from Chaga have

antioxidant effects through their superoxide scavenging activity79,80 The antioxidant mechanism may be as result of the supply of hydrogen by the polysaccharides, which combines with radicals and forms a stable radical to terminate the damaging radical chain reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-Inflammatory. Aqueous extract containing polysaccharides,

proteins, and phenolic compounds was administered to mice with intestinal inflammation. The extract suppressed edema, mucosal damage, and inhibited nMRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF- α , and there was an overall inhibition of inflammatory transcription factor NF- κ B.81

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypoglycemic. Polysaccharide-rich aqueous extract exhibits

hypoglycemic activities in vitro and in vivo. The animals in this study showed significant alpha-glucosidase activity inhibition, slowing the release of glucose in the intestine, and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia.82


<!-- chunk -->

## Psoriasis and GI inflammation. A group of 50 patients suffering

from psoriasis were treated with Chaga extract paste. Forty-three patients started the treatment with Chaga during the acute stage of psoriasis, and 7 started during the steady-state. Chaga extract was heated and one tablespoon of the extract was diluted in a glass of boiled water at room temperature. Chaga extract was administered three times a day 20 to 30 minutes before meals. Psoriatic rashes were significantly improved after 3 months of regular intake, and extensive psoriasis was completely cured in 16 patients. Overall, Chaga was found to be an especially useful treatment for patients with psoriasis co-occurring with chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and liver.83,84

## Maitake (Grifola frondosa, Hen of the Woods)


Traditionally, Maitake has been used in China to improve the spleen, appease stomach ailments, treat hemorrhoids, and calm the mind and nerves. Also a delicious culinary mushroom, it is commonly used as

<!-- chunk -->

## 685CHAPTER 90 Medicinal Mushrooms

food. Some medicinal mushrooms are much too woody to eat (Reishi, Turkey Tail, and Chaga), but Maitake is easy to cook and tastes rather good. As a general principle: mushrooms should be eaten if palatable.


β -D-glucans from Maitake have been named Maitake D fraction, or MD fraction, and have been the focus of many Maitake studies. Maitake also contains a significant amount of ergothioneine, and so possesses the beneficial antioxidant and neuroprotective qualities of ergothioneine described previously.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune modulation. In an animal study, Maitake extract decreased

TNF- α and enhanced interferon activity in rats with invasive bladder cancer. MD fraction relieves colon inflammation via suppression of both TNF- α and signaling through NF- κ B in vitro,85 and enhances both innate and adaptive immunity, indicating use for defense against foreign pathogens and protection for general, healthy immune function.86

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. MD fraction has direct antiproliferative and

cytotoxic effects in human cancer cells, including prostate, bladder, liver, brain, blood and breast. The mechanisms include a decrease in cell viability, increase in cell adhesion, and a reduction in the migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells. (Rossi) Fruiting body extract, which contains polysaccharides and phenolic compounds, displays an antiangiogenic effect in rats via inhibition of vaso-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and extracellular signal–related kinase (ERK) through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS).87 These in vitro and in vivo findings are meaningful when it comes to angiogenesis- associated diseases including retinopathies, benign and malignant angiogenic tumors, and progression of malignant tumors.


<!-- chunk -->

## Neoplasia. Maitake polysaccharide extract was administered

to postmenopausal women who had a history of breast cancer. At a dose of 5 mg/kg per day, increases in both suppressive and stimulatory cytokine blood markers were observed, including IL-10, IL-2, TNF- α , and IFN- γ ,88 which suggests an immunomodulatory action. Because this was a polysaccharide fraction and Maitake contains about 45% polysaccharides, if taking whole mushroom rather than polysaccharide extract, the dose should be doubled. In another human trial of patients with stage II to IV cancer, either cancer regression or significant symptom improvement was observed in 58% of liver cancer patients, 68.8% of breast cancer patients, and 62.5% of lung cancer patients.88

<!-- chunk -->

## Polycystic ovarian syndrome. Insulin resistance is a prominent

feature of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and insulin sensitizing drugs are used to induce ovulation, typically clomiphene citrate (CC). In a clinical trial with 72 patients with PCOS, 26 women took Maitake extract, 31 women took clomiphene citrate, and 18 women received combined therapy. The ovulation rates were 76.9% for the Maitake patients and 93.5% for the CC patients, while combination therapy increased the ovulation rate to 87%. These results indicate the possibility of using Maitake as a monotherapy to induce ovulation in PCOS patients as well as a combination therapy with clomiphene citrate.89

## Pleurotus ostreatus (Hiratake, píng g

ū

<!-- chunk -->

## , 平菇)


Oyster mushrooms have no boundaries—they grow everywhere, on most anything, and are used as food throughout the world. According to some resources, they were first cultivated in Germany during World War I as an important food source. Oyster mushrooms are an especially fascinating mushroom because they are considered carnivorous—they are one of the few mushrooms known to consume critters, specifically nematodes, as a nitrogen source (Fig. 90.9).


Oyster mushroom contains the most ergothioneine of any known mushroom, and so the antioxidant and neuroprotective actions of ergothioneine are a major component of the medicinal benefit. Other unique compounds found in Oyster mushroom include chrysin, lovas- tatin, and GABA. The β -D-glucan on which the majority of the Oyster mushroom cancer research is focused is called “pleuran.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Respiratory support. Active treatment in children for recurrent

respiratory tract infections with pleuran resulted in a significant reduction of peripheral blood eosinophils and stabilized levels of total IgE in serum. A potential mechanism proposed in the study was that allergic children have respiratory infections more often and through stabilization of IgE, these may be prevented.90

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiatherogenic. There are many factors that aggregate and result

in atherosclerosis. These include and are not limited to hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and lipid peroxidation. Oyster mushroom research has demonstrated protection against all of those factors. In an animal study, rats were administered chrysin-rich Pleurotus extract. After administration there was a significant decrease in mean blood serum levels of glucose, lipid profile parameters, and hepatic marker enzymes and a simultaneous increase in enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant parameters.91 P. ostreatus is the richest known source of ergothioneine, contain- ing 118.91 mg/kg. As mentioned previously, ergothioneine protects against DNA damage and lipid oxidation. For hypertension, Oyster mushroom water extract inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)—a common mechanism in hypertensive medication. Oyster mushroom also contains lovastatin, a naturally occurring statin compound that reduces LDL cholesterol through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.92

## Atopic dermatitis. In a split-body study of 80 patients, topical P.

ostreatus-based β -glucan cream application resulted in improvement

of both subjective and objective symptoms of atopic dermatitis. The patients applied the cream on one segment of the body with atopic dermatitis and no treatment on another atopic dermatitis segment. On the application site there was a significant decrease in the number of days and severity of atopic dermatitis.93

<!-- chunk -->

## Respiratory disease. Pleuran extract from Oyster mushrooms

has clinical evidence for application with various respiratory diseases. In a human study, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients treated with 100 mg pleuran, 60 mg vitamin C, and 5 mg zinc had significantly lower incidence and shorter duration of exacerbations compared with the control (60 mg vitamin C and 5 mg zinc).94 In another double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized multi- centric study, 175 children were treated with either pleuran or placebo over a 12-month period. Children treated with pleuran experienced a significant reduction in the frequency of recurrent respiratory tract infections.90,95 These findings agreed with a Spanish study investigating 166 children aged 1 to 10 years old who were also treated with pleuran for recurrent respiratory infection.96 Advantageous respiratory effects of pleuran were also observed in adult athletes. A study included 50 athletes treated with pleuran over a 3-month period of time and found a significant reduction in the fre- quency of upper respiratory tract infections compared with athletes treated with placebo. Blood samples of the athletes showed signifi- cantly higher levels of circulating NK cells in the pleuran group com- pared with the placebo group.97

## Lion’s Mane (Hericium erinaceus, Yamabushitake,

<!-- chunk -->

## Hedgehog Mushroom, 山伏茸, 猴头菇)


Although Lion’s Mane is now widely known for its nootropic effects, it was traditionally used in Chinese medicine to reduce gastrointestinal heat. This toothed mushroom can be cooked as food or taken as an extract. Historically, its major use was to lull gastrointestinal inflam- mation and cool gastrointestinal ulcers (Fig. 90.10).


The most studied constituents in Lion’s Mane are erinacines and hericenones, found in the mycelium and fruiting body, respectively. Erinacines are cyathin diterpenoids and have thus far only been found in mycelium extracts of Lion’s Mane. Erinacine A and S have been shown to increase nerve growth factor mRNA expression whereas erinacine E is a kappa opioid receptor agonist, prompting further investigation of potential benefit for opioid addiction.99 Hericenones are meroterpenoids that have anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of the inflammatory transcription factor, NF- κ B. Hericerins are aromatic, anti-inflammatory compounds that inhibit COX-2, and reduce iNOS, PGE2, TNF- α , IL-6, and IL-1.100,101

<!-- chunk -->

## Antifatigue. Animal studies demonstrated significant antifatigue

activity through an increase in tissue glycogen content and a decrease in both blood lactic acid and serum urea nitrogen.102

<!-- chunk -->

## Nervous system. There is speculation about the use of Lion’s

Mane for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and although animal trials are promising, there is not a known treatment dose for humans. In an animal model, polysaccharides extracted from fresh fruiting bodies of Lion’s Mane were administered to rats with peroneal nerve injury, and the rat’s ability to respond to heat stimulus and general recovery was significantly improved compared with the control.103,104 This aqueous extract contains neuroactive compounds that induce nerve growth factor synthase, which is important for promoting the growth and differentiation of neurons. Another animal model demonstrated that aqueous extract of Lion’s Mane fruiting body administered to rats with alloxan-induced diabetic neuropathic pain reversed diabetes-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. These diabetic rats also showed significant decrease in serum and urine glucose.105 Aqueous extracts also have been shown to ameliorate various Alzheimer’s disease-related pathologies. Mycelial extracts containing erinacine A and S have been shown to inhibit plaque growth, diminish activation of glial cells, and promote hippocampal neurogenesis.106 An animal study found that Lion’s Mane extract had anxiolytic effects with a chronic high-dose administration at 60 mg/kg. After 4 weeks at this dose, there was significantly less depressive behavior in the mice compared with the control group, and an increase in the number of proliferating cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, thereby enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis. This prolifera- tion is associated with an increase in nerve growth factor production stimulated by the mushroom extract.107

<!-- chunk -->

## Gastrointestinal effects. In an animal study, mice with alcohol-

induced gastric ulcers were administered a fruiting body polysaccharide extract of H. erinaceus. There was a significant improvement in treated mice compared with the control—fewer ulcerations, less inflammatory cytokines, and improved overall regulation of gastric secretions— suggesting use as an adjunct therapy for gastric ulcers.108

## Depression and anxiety. The combined anti-inflammatory

and nerve growth factor-enhancing actions have proven to reduce depression and anxiety, specifically in menopausal females. In one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, women

were given four cookies with .5 g of powdered fruiting body or placebo for 4 weeks. The women who consumed the Lion’s Mane cookies experienced significantly less anxiety and depression compared with the placebo.109

<!-- chunk -->

## Gastrointestinal inflammation. Traditionally, Lion’s Mane

has been used to lull gastrointestinal inflammation and preliminary clinical research suggests that taking H. erinaceus before meals daily for 3 months improves symptoms of GI inflammation. In this study, patients who presented with chronic atrophic gastritis were given either Lion’s Mane extract or placebo. The Lion’s Mane group had significant improvement in upper abdominal pain, dysplasia, and an overall reduction in inflammatory infiltration.110

## Shiitake (Lentinula edodes, 椎茸, 香菇, 표고)


The legend goes that 5000 years ago a deity, Shennong, bestowed the world with Shiitake as well as all other medicinal mushrooms. Logs would be inoculated with Shiitake spores during a child’s birth, and the child and the mushrooms would mature together until adulthood. At adulthood, the child would be lucky enough to inherit the fortune of the shiitake flush (Fig. 90.11).


The majority of research regarding Shitake has explored a spe- cific β -D-glucan, lentinan. Lentinan, like other β -D-glucans, has immune-centric qualities including antineoplastic and anti-inflamma- tory activity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. Lentinan inhibits both tumor angiogenesis

and the growth of lung and colon cancers by increasing IFN- γ production.112 Lentinan exerts antitumor effects in colon cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cancer cell apoptosis is induced through two major pathways: the intrinsic pathway via overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-9 and the extrinsic pathway through the increase of TNF- α , NF- κ B inhibition, and activation of caspase-8 and 3.113 Other studies have concluded that lentinan also inhibits tumor cell proliferation through targeting p53 tumor suppressor gene, increasing tumor cell apoptosis through caspase-3- dependent signaling pathways, and inhibiting angiogenesis through VEGF depression.114

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-Inflammatory. NF-

κ B is an important regulatory element for IL-8 expression in human epithelial cells; in an animal study, lentinan suppressed IL-8 gene expression, which indicates lentinan could be beneficial for intestinal inflammatory diseases, like irritable bowel disease (IBD), in humans.115

<!-- chunk -->

## Oral antimicrobial. In vitro studies have explored the effect of

Shiitake extracts containing adenine and oxalic acid on common bacteria implicated in caries and gingivitis. Adenine showed 50% biofilm inhibition with Streptococcus mutans, and 20% biofilm disaggregation, whereas oxalic acid showed biofilm inhibition of 80% for Actinomyces naeslundii.116,117 The Shiitake mushroom aqueous extract (1 mg/mL) demonstrated antimicrobial activity against 84.6% of 39 microorganisms tested.118 Sesquiterpenes, steroids, anthraquinone, benzoic acid derivatives and quinolones in shiitake extract all inhibit growth of S. mutans. Oil extract is the most efficacious in biofilm inhibition and disruption, potentially due to the carvicrol content in the oil extract, which significantly inhibited and disrupted P. gingivalis.119


<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. Patients with gastric cancer were administered

either chemotherapy alone or chemo-immunotherapy with lentinan. There was a significantly longer median overall survival time in the lentinan group and the researchers concluded that lentinan should be widely accepted for use as adjunctive chemo-immunotherapy treatment for advanced gastric cancer. The lentinan treated group was administered 2 mg/body (JP: This unclear dosage is what was reported in the study) weight via IV for 30 minutes every 2 to 3 weeks.120 Lentinan provides synergistic actions with a molecular targeting agent and cytotoxic drugs through the modulation of antibody-dependent cellular toxicity and programmed cell death, which may support the idea that the chemo-immunotherapy prolongs the survival of metastatic gastric cancer patients, compared with chemotherapy alone.121 A case of recurrent ovarian cancer was successfully treated with immunotherapy alongside 2 mg IV lentinan administered every weeks. In this case study, lentinan changed the Th1/Th2 balance such that the Th1 level exceeded Th2. The authors proposed that lenti- nan worked on cervical lymph node metastatic cancer by evading the immune surveillance system.122 Other studies exploring the use of lentinan as an adjunct to che- motherapy found less adverse side effects from the chemotherapy, improved IFN- γ production, and increased NK cell count.123


Few clinical trials have been done with humans consuming whole mushroom or whole mushroom extract, and most research on Shiitake focuses on lentinan and cancer. This research is hopeful, yet it leaves the dosage for whole Shiitake mushroom unknown. Based on research with other mushrooms, dosage is most likely to be at least 3 g/day for immune-centric effects.

## Antioxidant. Phenolic compounds from A. blazei showed higher

antioxidant activity compared with Shiitake.131


<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer. A. Blazei mushroom extract was administered to

gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Blood was drawn a few weeks after administration, and NK cell count was significantly higher in the mushroom extract group compared with the placebo group, and there was a significant reduction in chemotherapy- associated side effects.132

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes. Either Agaricus blazei fruiting body extract (AbM)

or placebo (cellulose) was administered in a 5-month trial with registered patients with diabetes who had been taking gliclazide and metformin for more than 6 months. Subjects took either 500 mg of AbM extract or cellulose three times a day for 12 weeks; the capsule was taken with glicliazide 30 minutes before eating and metformin was taken 30 minutes after eating. The AbM group had improved insulin resistance, possibly due to an increase in adiponectin concentration after the 12 week treatment.133

## Enokitake (Flammulina velutipes, えのき茸, 팽이버섯)


Enokitake has been consumed as food for millennia throughout Asia. Not surprisingly, an epidemiological survey of cancer deaths found that Enokitake mushroom farmers (who were consuming a lot of eno- kitake mushrooms) had lower rates of cancer deaths than controls who were not involved in farming.


Similar to other medicinal fungi, Enokitake has an affinity for the immune system and contributes to cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The isolated constituent proflamin prolongs the survival of cancer-stricken mice by 85%.134

<!-- chunk -->

## Microbiome modulation. An intriguing in vivo animal study

found that Enokitake polysaccharide extract improves scopol- amine-induced learning and memory impairment in mice by mod- ulating gut microbiota composition. Through modulating the gut microbiome to a more favorable composition, there was a reduction in neuroinflammation and, therefore, an antagonizing effect of the sco- polamine-induced memory deficit.135

<!-- chunk -->

## Antimicrobial. In vitro research has demonstrated antioxidant

and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtillus.136

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-Inflammatory. A recent review article explains that the immu-

nomodulatory protein, FIP-fve, elicits its immunomodulatory effects by shifting toward a Th1 immune response. FVP-fve also successfully sup- presses airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness via inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration and Th2 cytokines. This protein also inhibits host dust mite-induced asthma inflammation in mice.137 The water-soluble polysaccharide FVP-2 enhanced growth of pri- mary hepatocytes from mice in vitro via inhibition of intracellular ala- nine aminotransferase (ALT) and portrayed anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of iNOS, TNF- α , and COX-2 in vitro.137


There are not enough clinical studies to propose specific dosage.

# II. MUSHROOMS WITH LABORATORY AND

# ANIMAL RESEARCH BUT INSUFFICIENT HUMAN

# CLINICAL TRIALS

The following mushrooms have encouraging in vitro research and in vivo animal studies. Similar to the previously mentioned mush- rooms, they have antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, immune-modu- lating, and antioxidant qualities. These mushrooms have a long history of use, but a lack of human clinical trials.

## Red Belted Polypore (Fomitopsis pinicola)


F. pinicola is one of the most commonly found polypore mushrooms throughout the world. Traditionally, it has been used for treatment of headache, nausea, liver problems, as a styptic, and as an anti-in- flammatory agent. Interestingly, during the 1800s, eclectic physicians soaked the polypore in whiskey as a remedy for malaria-like symptoms (Fig. 90.12).

## Antineoplastic. In vitro, F. pinicola extract proves to employ

many antineoplastic actions inhibiting cell migration, inducing ROS- dependent apoptosis, and causing p53 mediated G1 phase arrest in human colorectal cancer cells. The researchers postulate that ergosterol may play a role in these processes.138

<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidant. In vitro, both extracellular and intracellular poly-

saccharides consisting of mannose, rhamnose, xylose, and galactose portray strong free radical scavenging abilities, reducing UV- and H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative damage.139 Another study investigating the antioxidant properties of F. pinicola uncovered that the antioxidant effects were mostly likely caused by the phenolic compounds con- tained in the mushroom extract.140

<!-- chunk -->

## Anti-Inflammatory. Ethanol extract of Red Belted Polypore

fresh fruiting bodies contains a number of lanostane triterpenes,141 fomitopinic acids, and lanostane triterpene glycosides, fomitosides. In vitro, this extract selectively inhibits COX-2.142

<!-- chunk -->

## Fire Sponge (Phellinus linteus, Phellinus igniarius,

<!-- chunk -->

## Mesima, Willow bracket)


The Yup’ik of Western Alaska called the fungus arak, and the mixture of tobacco and the ash iqmik—“thing to put in the mouth.” It has been reported that 52% of First Nations people used this fungus. The mush- room was traditionally burnt to an ash and smoked with tobacco143 (Fig. 90.13).


Phellinus spp. contain two noteworthy phenolic compounds— phelligridin and hispolon. Phelligridins are antiviral,144 whereas hispo- lon has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic qualities.19,145

<!-- chunk -->

## Antineoplastic. In vitro, hispolon has significant antitumor

activity.146,147 In one study exploring antineoplastic mechanisms of hispolon on human lung cancer cells, the proposed mechanism of action was an induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.146 Ethanol extracts inhibit the proliferation of human hepatocarci- noma cell lines as well as rat heart vascular endothelial cells. When the extract was given in combination with chemotherapy, there was a synergistic inhibition of the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma.148 This study and others suggest hepatoprotective qualities for the ethanol extract.146

<!-- chunk -->

## Antiviral. The water extract is effective against influenza virus A

and B, including H1N1, H2N3, and Avian flu. The extract interferes with events in the virus replication cycle, including viral attachment to the target cell.149 Fruiting body extracts inhibit neuraminidase from H3N2, H1N1, and H5N1 influenza viruses.144

<!-- chunk -->

## Immune modulation. The biologically active compounds that

modulate the immune system have been found to have therapeutic value for slowing multiple sclerosis progression in mice.150 After weeks of being injected with the extract every other day, demyelination and immune cell infiltrations in the spinal cord were examined and there was a significant decrease in the daily incidence rate and clinical score of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

## Witch’s Butter (Tremella fuciformis, Tremella aurantia,

<!-- chunk -->

## Tremella mesenterica, 雪耳)


In Chinese medicine this slimy mushroom is used for cooling, moist- ening, and nourishing the lungs, stomach, and kidneys. It has been used in body care products throughout Asia and is said to provide proper moisture to the skin. The traditional use for skin elasticity is to brew fruiting bodies as a thick gelatinous tea and apply to the skin with a cotton pad, rinsing after 30 minutes.


Pharmacologically active polysaccharides make up the bulk of the fruit body at 60% to 90%, whereas with other medicinal mushrooms, polysaccharides make up a much smaller part of the biomass (closer to 10%–40%). These polysaccharides, like all fungal polysaccharides, demonstrate antioxidant and immune-modulating activities.151

<!-- chunk -->

## Antidiabetic. Intraperitoneal and oral administration with a

water-soluble polysaccharide from T. fuciformis and T. aurantia had significant hypoglycemic activity in normal mice and had significant antihyperglycemic activity in mice with streptozotocin-induced and genetic diabetes. These antidiabetic effects result from the increase in insulin secretion and the acceleration in glucose metabolism in the liver.151 Animal models administered with T. mesenterica had significantly decreased 2-hour postprandial serum concentrations of insulin with- out altering blood glucose concentrations. These results suggest that T. mesenterica has the ability to increase the insulin sensitivity, instead of increasing the insulin secretion, in normal rats.153


<!-- chunk -->

## Cognitive impairment. Seventy-five subjects were randomly

allocated to receive supplementation with T. fuciformis; this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that oral administration of T. fuciformis improved subjective memory complaints and cognitive performance in individuals with subjective cognitive impairment. Treatment was given in low doses of 600 mg per day or high doses of 1200 mg per day and there was significant improvement with short-term memory and executive performance in the high-dose treatment group. T. fuciformis supplementation was also associated with increases in gray matter volumes of several brain regions.154

## Psilocybe spp.

Psilocybe mushrooms have been used as ceremonial entheogens by cul- tures all over the world. In recent years, there has been a significant number of in vivo human trials exploring the benefits of psilocybin, an alkaloid derived from this mushroom. Psilocybin is being inves- tigated for more complex psycho-emotional disorders such as addic- tion,155-158 depression,159 and end-of-life cancer-related psychological distress160,161 (Fig. 90.14).


Many of these medicinal mushrooms are consumed as food in various parts of the world and are considered safe even when consumed in large quantities on a regular basis. One should be aware, however, that because some of these mushrooms can chelate heavy metals from their substrate, growing conditions must always be considered. Medicinal mushrooms must be obtained from dependable, certified organic sources. Although mild side effects were reported in the literature, as with most natural health products, a practitioner will rarely run into these problems. There were two reported cases of hepatic toxicity linked to the long- term use of Reishi.162,163 There was also a case of chronic diarrhea in a 49-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma after prolonged con- sumption of Reishi extract.164 Prolonged consumption of Shiitake was linked to a few cases of dermatitis and photosensitivity.165,166 Eosinophilia and gastrointesti- nal upsets were also observed with the use of Shiitake.167


Drug interactions with medicinal mushrooms are more theoretical than clinically proven. The most common category of these drug interactions is one of “theoretical accumulation.” Many of these mushrooms work on blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood lipid issues—the type of concerns for which patients are often already prescribed pharmaceuticals. Frequently, after consuming mush- room preparations together with the drugs for a month or so, the patient will require less or no pharmaceuticals for these conditions moving forward. These effects become less about drug–mushroom interactions and more about the mushroom preparation exerting its effects. Using mushroom preparation in diabetic or hyperten- sive patients requires close blood sugar monitoring during the first few months of treatment as the pharmaceutical dosage may require adjustment. The mushroom that has been highlighted the most in this area is Reishi because of its large range of therapeu- tic uses and the large number of people consuming it. Although anticoagulant, antiplatelet, immunosuppressant, and cytochrome p450 interaction concerns can be found in the literature, it is dif- ficult to find research on actual cases of these problems. Again, concerns seem to lie more in the realms of theory and caution than actual cases.


We have discussed a wide variety of potential medicinal applications for a wide variety of mushrooms, and many have extensive in vitro and in vivo research to support their efficacy. There is, however, a great need for more human clinical trials, though the trials that have been completed show positive therapeutic outcomes with few, if any, harmful side effects. There is wide use of mushroom polysaccharides as adjunctives to cancer therapies throughout Asia, though these strat- egies are underused in the United States. Recent interest in medicinal mushrooms has improved availability for lay people, but there con- tinues to be little clinical use. As a consequence, there is still much to learn about specific dosage for many conditions, and further research is warranted.

# A NOTE ABOUT PURCHASING MUSHROOM

# SUPPLEMENTS

When purchasing medicinal mushroom products, it is important to understand the extraction methods used in production. Mushrooms must be heated to properly extract the water-soluble polysaccharides, and cold ethanol extracts are not an appropriate delivery method for these compounds. When purchasing mushroom products as a liquid, the extract should have gone through a dual extraction process—with hot water and ethanol. When purchasing capsules, there should be powdered extract within the capsules, and if the label simply reads “mushroom powder,” it is a good indication that the contents will be unprocessed mushroom powders that are generally indigestible. If a product is mycelium-based, the dose will most likely need to be higher because it will be diluted by the substrate the mycelium was growing on.

Tea tree oil possesses significant antiseptic properties and is regarded by many as the ideal skin disinfectant. This claim is supported by its efficacy against a wide range of organisms, its good penetration, and its lack of skin irritation.1 The therapeutic uses of tea tree oil are based largely on its antiseptic and antifungal properties. Bacteria and fungal organisms inhibited by tea tree oil are listed in Tables 100.1 and 100.2.1,4–6


The historical uses of tea tree oil demonstrate its wide range of applica- tions as an antiseptic. Three of the more popular and documented uses are in the treatment of skin infections, vaginal infections, and common foot complaints.

<!-- chunk -->

## Skin Infections

Tea tree oil is useful in a broad range of dermal infections, not only because of its broad-spectrum antiseptic properties but also because of its capacity to mix with sebaceous secretions and penetrate the epidermis. A clinical trial in patients with furuncles demonstrated that tea tree oil encouraged more rapid healing without scarring than was seen in matched control subjects.7 Presumably, the positive clinical effects were a result of the oil’s germicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Tea tree oil efficiently kills S. aureus in the stationary growth phase and within biofilms, making it a promising tool for S. aureus eradication.8 Furthermore, other studies have shown that tea tree oil is antimicrobial against antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus.9,10 In the clinical trial, the method of application consisted of cleaning the site followed by painting the surface of the furuncle freely with tea tree oil two or three times a day. For most skin infections, the most effective treatment appears to be direct application of full-strength, undiluted oil at the site of infection. If irritation occurs, diluted preparations may be tried.

## Lice Infestations

Pediculosis capitis (head lice infestation) treatment typically involves the application of topical insecticides such as a pyrethrin or perme- thrin. An in vitro study showed that tea tree oil exerted the greatest effect of essential oils tested against head lice.11 A clinical study com- pared the efficacy and safety of three topical pediculicides. A ped- iculicide containing tea tree and lavender oil was compared with a product containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide; the percent- age of subjects who were louse-free 1 day after the last treatment with the tea tree oil and lavender product was 97.6% (41 of 42 patients) compared with 25% (10 of 40 patients) of those using the prod- uct containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide.12 These clinical results, along with in vitro studies, indicate that products contain- ing tea tree oil are effective alternatives to pyrethrin-based products. However, it should also be mentioned that in an in vitro study look- ing at essential oils from tea tree, wild bergamot, clove, lavender, and Yunnan verbena, by far the best mite destruction was produced by clove oil, diluted either in coconut oil or sunflower oil.13 Clove oil produced greater than 90% mortality within 2 hours in lice submit- ted to a 30-minute contact. The high content of eugenol was thought to be the main factor.

## Oral Infections

Tea tree oil was shown to exert significant activity against oral patho- gens, both bacterial and fungal, and was suggested to be a suitable alternative to chlorhexidine.14 From a clinical perspective, these effects may best be used in the treatment of oral candidiasis (thrush). In one open study, 27 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and oral candidiasis that was clinically refractory to fluco- nazole were randomly assigned to receive either an alcohol-based or an alcohol-free melaleuca oral solution four times daily for 2 to 4 weeks. Overall, 60% of patients demonstrated a clinical response to the mela- leuca oral solution (seven cases were cured, and eight cases were clini- cally improved) at 4-week evaluation.15 Tea tree oil appears to be quite useful in oral candidiasis in cancer patients. Often these yeasts are resistant to azole antifungal drugs. In one study, 301 yeasts isolated from the mouths of 199 patients with advanced cancer were shown to be susceptible to tea tree oil, includ- ing 41 yeasts that were known to be resistant to both fluconazole and itraconazole.16 A sublethal concentration of tea tree oil or terpinen-4-ol was shown to dramatically increase the activity of fluconazole against 32 clinical strains of fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans. The 24-hour expo- sure of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains to fluconazole with tea tree oil resulted in 62.5% of isolates being classified as susceptible, 25.0% as intermediately susceptible, and only 12.5% as resistant. Even better results were seen with terpinen-4-ol. These results demonstrate that combining tea tree oil with fluconazole may be the best approach in treating difficult yeast infections.17

## Dandruff

There is evidence that dandruff appears to be related to the yeast Pityrosporum ovale. Because tea tree oil has antifungal activity against P. ovale, a 4-week study was designed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 5% tea tree oil shampoo versus a placebo in 126 male and female patients, aged 14 years and older, with moderate dandruff. The 5% tea tree oil shampoo group showed a 41% improvement in the quadrant-area-severity score, compared with an 11% improvement in the placebo group. Statistically significant improvements were also observed in the score for total area of involvement, the total severity score, and the itchiness and greasiness components of the patients’ self-assessments. The scaliness component of patient self-assessment improved but was not statistically significant. There were no adverse effects.18

## Acne

Topical application of tea tree oil is a suitable alternative to benzoyl peroxide preparations.19,20 In one study, 124 patients with mild to moderate acne randomly received either a 5% gel of tea tree oil or 5% benzoyl peroxide lotion to be applied topically every day. After months, both treatments produced a significant improvement in the mean number of both noninflamed and inflamed lesions, although with noninflamed lesions, benzoyl peroxide was found to be more effective. An important finding was that there were fewer reports of side effects (dryness, pruritus, stinging, burning, and skin redness) with tea tree oil (44% vs. 79%).20

## Demodicosis

Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis are skin mites primarily found in the face, near the nose, the eyelashes, and eyebrows, but also occur elsewhere on the body. D. folliculorum is found in hair follicles; D. brevis in sebaceous glands. When these mite populations dramati- cally increase, it results in a condition known as demodicosis. There is also a link between Demodex infection with acne vulgaris and rosa- cea. Topical application of tea tree oil has been shown to be effective in improving demodex-related diseases.21 In particular, tea tree oil at 50% concentration is effective in reducing Demodex mite counts and the surface inflammation associated with blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and keratitis. However, tea tree oil can also cause ocular irritation, so it has been suggested that because terpinen-4-ol is the most potent ingre- dient, using terpinen-4-ol alone would not only enhance its potency in killing Demodex mites but also reduce the adverse effects noted with the other ingredients in tea tree.22

## Common Foot Problems

Tea tree oil, in emollient form (8% tea tree oil) or in solution (40%), can be massaged into the feet daily for the treatment of tinea pedis, foot irritation, and bromhidrosis (severely foul-smelling feet). One researcher concluded, after 6 years of using different concen- trations and preparations, that tea tree oil eradicated or improved the symptoms of tinea pedis when used daily by patients at home.4 He also reported that even undiluted forms had little effect on onycho- mycosis (discussed further in “Fungal Nail Infection”). Diluted tea tree oil in solution was found to reduce foot irritation and promote wound healing with surgical incision in cases of corns, calluses, bun- ions, and hammer toes and was extremely effective in diminishing bromhidrosis.

## 696SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

In tinea pedis, one double-blind study found that 10% tea tree oil cream compared quite favorably with the antifungal tolnaftate in reliev- ing symptoms but was less effective in eliminating the fungi from cul- tures.5 Specifically, both the tea tree group (24 of 37 patients) and the tolnaftate group (19 of 33 patients) showed significant improvement in the four clinical parameters of scaling, inflammation, itching, and burn- ing, but only 30% of the subjects who applied tea tree oil cream tested culture negative, compared with 85% in the tolnaftate group. In another double-blind trial, 158 patients with tinea pedis were ran- domly assigned to receive either placebo or a 25% or 50% tea tree oil solution.23 Patients applied the solution twice daily to affected areas for weeks and were assessed after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. A marked clin- ical response was seen in 68% of the 50% tea tree oil group and in 72% of the 25% tea tree oil group, compared with 39% in the placebo group. Mycologic cure was assessed by culture of skin scrapings taken at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. The mycologic cure rate was 64% in the 50% tea tree oil group compared with 31% in the placebo group. Four (3.8%) patients applying tea tree oil experienced moderate to severe der- matitis that improved quickly upon cessation of the study medication.

## Fungal Nail Infection

Fungal nail infections (onychomycosis) are the most common cause of nail disease, affecting approximately 2% to 13% of the population. Standard medical treatments include débridement, topical antifungals, and systemic antifungals. All current therapies have high recurrence rates. Oral therapy has the added disadvantages of high cost and poten- tially serious adverse effects. One study compared the efficacy and tolerability of the topical application of 1% clotrimazole (CL) solution with that of 100% tea tree oil for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.24 The 117 patients received twice daily applications of either 1% CL solution or 100% tea tree oil for 6 months. Débridement and clinical assessment were per- formed at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Culture specimens were obtained at and 6 months. Each patient’s subjective assessment was also obtained 3 months after the conclusion of therapy. After 6 months of therapy, the two treatment groups were comparable on the basis of culture cure (CL = 11%, tea tree = 18%) and clinical assessment documenting par- tial or full resolution (CL = 61%, tea tree = 60%). Three months later, about half of each group reported continued improvement or resolu- tion (CL = 55%, tea tree = 56%). These results indicate that topical therapy with tea tree oil, in conjunction with débridement, provides excellent improvement in nail appearance and symptomatology.

## Vaginal Infections

Tea tree oil demonstrates germicidal activity against a number of common vaginal pathogens and opportunistic organisms, including Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans.25 A 40% solution of tea tree oil emulsified with isopropyl alcohol and water was found to be highly effective for the treatment of cervicitis, chronic endocervicitis, trichomonal vaginitis, and vaginal candidia- sis.25 Weekly in-office treatment (usually four to six were necessary) involved thorough washing of the perineum, labia, and vagina with a suitable scrub (the commercial product pHisoHex was used in the study). After drying, the affected areas were washed with a 1% tea tree oil solution. This was followed by insertion of a tampon (three 4 × 4–inch sponges) saturated with the 40% tea tree oil solution. Patients were instructed to remove the tampon after 24 hours. For infectious processes—trichomonas and candidiasis—daily vag- inal douches containing 1 quart of water with a 0.4% concentration of the oil were prescribed. No irritation, burning, or other side effects were reported or observed with either the office applications or the douches.


A number of commercial products contain tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be used as a topical antiseptic for reducing microbial counts in wounds, surgical incisions, and skin and vaginal infections. In addi- tion, tea tree leaves can be used to make teas that may be of benefit in cases of sore throat, tonsillitis, sinus infections, and colitis.


Tea tree oil appears to be very safe for use as a topical antiseptic.26 However, it may cause allergic contact dermatitis in some individu- als. During a 3-year period, seven patients were seen in an outpatient dermatology clinic in Kona, Hawaii, for contact dermatitis because of the use of commercially available product containing 100% tea tree oil.27 The patients were treating preexisting skin conditions, which included foot fungus, dog scratches, insect bites, and rashes. All patients presented with an eczematous dermatitis. Patch tests indi- cated that all patients were sensitive to a 1% solution of tea tree oil. Individuals should apply the oil to a small area of skin before using tea tree oil for the first time so as to avoid contact dermatitis over a larger area. The oral ingestion of tea tree oil cannot be recommended because it could lead to a toxic reaction. However, folk use suggests that oral ingestion of tea from the leaves is reasonably safe.


Tea tree oil may produce a synergistic effect with other topical antimi- crobials. In an in vitro study, tea tree oil and tobramycin in combina- tion produced significantly lower minimum inhibitory concentrations against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.28 A similar syner- gism was demonstrated between tea tree oil and the antifungal com- pound amphotericin in inhibiting Candida species.29

## Jet Lag

Melatonin for the treatment of jet lag has been extensively studied in controlled studies and proven to be remarkably successful in reduc- ing jet lag symptoms.10 In one early double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy volunteers (8 women, 12 men; 28–68 years) engaging in long-haul air flights across five time zones were invited to participate to explore the effects of melatonin on their jet lag symptoms. Subjects were randomly assigned to 5 mg of melatonin or placebo for 3 days before their outward flight (London to New Zealand) and during the flight between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm local time, as well as for 3 days after their arrival between 10:00 pm and 12:00 am . According to the results of visual analog scale (VAS) testing, those using the melatonin had less overall jet lag symptoms at day 10 (mean score 2.15) versus placebo (3.40; P < 0.01). Moreover, the melatonin group experienced a better adaptation pattern in terms of sleep pattern, daytime tired- ness, and normal energy levels than the placebo group (P < 0.05).11 Although this latter study suggested an optimal time pattern for mel- atonin use in an eastbound flight, another author noted that bedtime may not be an ideal time to employ melatonin on a westbound flight that crosses less than six to eight time zones. He suggested employing a lower dose of melatonin (0.5 mg) on the westbound flight later in the evening as “melatonin has the least phase shifting effects when it overlaps with endogenous secretion.”12

## Acute Sleep

It is estimated that 50 to 70 million American adults have difficulty sleeping.13 This issue of poor sleep quality can have profound conse- quences for the individual and society at large, including an increased risk of accidents and mood and behavioral changes, as well as a reduc- tion in work productivity.14 One of the numerous options available to help improve overall sleep is melatonin, both in healthy adults as an acute remedy for insomnia and in the elderly dealing with issues of chronic insomnia. The acute use of melatonin in healthy adults with- out insomnia at doses of 0.3 to 1 mg at 8:00 or 9:00 pm significantly reduces sleep-onset latency and latency to stage 2 sleep compared with the placebo (P <0.001). Moreover, melatonin does not produce any “sleep hangover” symptoms (according to the Profile of Mood States and Four Choice Reaction Time Test) commonly associated with ben- zodiazepine-type drug use.15

## Insomnia in the Elderly

Most elderly individuals report sleeping an average of 7 hours a night. Although the total amount of sleep time does not change as we age, alterations in sleep architecture are common.16 This includes a decrease in both deep sleep (stages 3 and 4 slow wave sleep) and rapid eye move- ment (REM) sleep, as well as an increase in stage 1 (light) sleep.17 Older individuals also have a reduction in endogenous melatonin production (likely due to a deterioration in the neuronal functioning of the SCN), which in turn disrupts the normal wake/sleep cycle.18 In a controlled clinical trial, 30 men and women over 50 years of age with both chronic insomnia and normal sleep patterns were randomized to receive capsules with either 0.1, 0.3, or 3 mg of mel- atonin or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime for 7 days. Treatments were separated by a 1-week washout period. Using polysomnography, the researchers concluded that although melatonin did not improve sleep efficiency in normal subjects, those with chronic insomnia had significant improvements in sleep efficiency at all three melatonin doses used, with the 0.3 mg dose triggering the strongest effect (P < 0.0001). The physiological dose acted primarily in the middle por- tion of the night and raised plasma melatonin levels to normal. The authors noted that 3 mg of melatonin significantly raised plasma levels throughout a portion of the day and triggered reductions in core body temperature after ingestion of the hormone.6

## Prolonged Release Melatonin in the Elderly

After a 2-week single blind run-in period, 354 elderly men and women (55–80 years of age) with primary insomnia were randomized to receive 2 mg of a prolonged release (PR) melatonin or placebo 2 hours before bedtime, for 3 weeks. Subjects enrolled in the study were asked to complete a sleep diary measuring quality of day and night, plus a battery of sleep questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), as well as quality-of-life (World Health Organization-5 [WHO-5] Well Being Index) and clinician Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores. At the conclusion of the trial, those who took the melatonin had improved (26%) quality of sleep and morning alertness as recorded by the LSEQ in contrast to placebo (15%) (P = 0.014). Sleep latency, as noted by the PSQI results, improved in subjects employing the PR melatonin by 24.3 minutes compared with 12.9 minutes for the placebo group (P = 0.028). Quality of life as recorded by the WHO-5 Index was also improved in the active group (P = 0.034).19 A similar study sup- ported the latter conclusion with a positive effect found on the restor- ative value of sleep in elderly patients using 2 mg of PR melatonin. Moreover, melatonin users did not experience any rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms at the conclusion of the controlled study. The authors noted that plasma cortisol increased in middle-aged adults, and this phenomenon might impair sleep. Administration of PR mela- tonin in older adults with primary insomnia may delay the production of nighttime cortisol, with subsequent improvements in both sleep quality and morning alertness.20

## Magnesium, Melatonin, and Zinc on Primary Insomnia

<!-- chunk -->

## and the Elderly

Magnesium, along with zinc, is crucial for the endogenous synthesis of melatonin according to the results of one study. Elderly men and women (n = 43; average age 78.3 years) living in a long-term care facil- ity were invited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 60 days’ duration on melatonin, zinc, and magnesium on pri- mary insomnia. Each volunteer was randomized to receive a 100 g pear pulp food supplement with 5 mg melatonin, 225 mg of magnesium, and 11.25 mg of zinc, or placebo 1 hour before bedtime for 2 months. At the conclusion of the trial, those employing the active supplement experienced an improvement in their overall PSQI scores compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Moreover, the LSEQ results confirmed that HO Serotonin N H NH 2 CH 3 O HO AANAT AcCoACoA N-acetyl-serotonin N H N H CH 3 O CH 3 O Melatonin ASMT N H N H

those employing the food mixture not only had better quality of sleep but had greater ease getting to sleep (P < 0.001). Quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 scale, which noted that the active group had better physical and mental function- ing after 8 weeks of treatment (P = 0.006). Adverse effects were min- imal, with only two participants in the treatment group complaining of headache, whereas one volunteer in the placebo group complained of epigastric pain.21

## Insomnia in Perimenopausal Women

In a series of case reports, 11 perimenopausal women (45–52 years) with insomnia were treated with 7.5 to 15 mg of mirtazapine for 2 to weeks. Two milligrams of melatonin were then added to the treatment regimen, along with a concomitant reduction and discontinuation of mirtazapine for 30 to 90 days. Global PSQI scores decreased from 17.45 at baseline to 8.55 at the second visit (mirtazapine and PR mel- atonin) to 6 by the third visit (PR melatonin) (P < 0.01). These latter changes were paralleled by a similar drop in PSQI sleep latency scores, with 52.73, 21.36, and 18.64 minutes at baseline, visit 2, and visit 3, respectively (P < 0.01). Volunteers also noted that their quality of life as measured by the WHO-5 score improved significantly by 89% from baseline (P < 0.01).22

## Chronic Sleep Onset Insomnia in Children

Pediatric insomnia is estimated to affect 1% to 6% of children, but can be significantly elevated to 50% to 75% if there are other associ- ated psychiatric or neurodevelopmental issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and epilepsy.23 A group of children (49 boys, 13 girls; aged 6–12 years) with chronic sleep-onset insomnia of more than 12 months’ duration were random- ized to receive 5 mg melatonin or placebo at 7 pm for 30 days. Using several questionnaires measuring overall health status (RAND General Health Rating Index and Functional Status II), children who used the melatonin had better outcomes in terms of eating, sleeping, response to attention, fatigue, illness, and overall health than those who received the placebo (P < 0.05). In addition, melatonin users had an advance- ment in their sleep onset by 57 minutes (P = 0.003), a reduction in sleep latency by 17 minutes (P = 0.048), and a decrease in their dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) by 82 minutes (P < 0.001).24

## Insomnia, Melatonin, and Chronic Obstructive

<!-- chunk -->

## Pulmonary Disorder

Approximately 40% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) complain of sleep disorders.25 Treatment of sleep disorders in this population group may help improve their overall quality of life as noted in one study employing melatonin.26 Thirty- nine patients (64–67 years of age on average) with stage II to IV COPD were randomized to receive 3 mg of melatonin or placebo 1 hour before bedtime for 21 days. In the 25 patients who completed the study, the overall PSQI score was significantly improved in those employing the melatonin (P = 0.012). In addition, components of the PSQI including an improvement in sleep latency (P = 0.008) and an increase in sleep duration (P = 0.046) were noted in the active group. There was no dif- ference between active and placebo groups in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), lung function parameters (forced expiratory volume in second [FEV1], forced vital capacity [FVC], and FEV1/FVC ratio), or functional exercise capacity as measured by the 6-minute walking dis- tance test. Four of the 25 cases reported adverse events including mild headache and dryness of mouth in the melatonin group and tongue swelling, mouth dryness, and loss of appetite in the placebo group.27 A subsequent controlled study in patients with COPD has shown that a similar dose of melatonin decreases 8-isoprostane from a baseline measure of 20.41 ± 2.92 pg/mL to 12.70 ± 2.18 pg/mL (P = 0.04) by month 3. Moreover, dyspnea was improved significantly by melatonin treatment (P = 0.01) without changes in lung function or exercise capacity. A significant increase in interleukin-8 (IL-8) was seen in the placebo group only (P = 0.03).28

## Tetraplegia, Sleep Disruption, and Melatonin

Individuals with spinal cord injury, especially tetraplegia, have higher rates of sleep disturbances and subsequently poorer quality of life.29 Eight individuals with chronic complete tetraplegia (average age 49.5 years) were randomized to receive 3 mg of melatonin capsules or pla- cebo 2 hours before bedtime for 3 weeks. In those taking the mela- tonin, the proportion of light sleep (stages 1 and 2 sleep) significantly increased after melatonin use (P < 0.05). In addition, quality of life as measured by Assessment of Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQoL) sub- scale ‘psychological wellbeing’ was significantly improved after mela- tonin use compared with placebo (P < 0.01). Similarly, values on the Basic Nordic Sleepiness Questionnaire (BNSQ) item number 12 (i.e., how many hours of sleep per night the participant was experiencing), were significantly elevated after melatonin use in contrast to placebo (P < 0.05).30

## Melatonin, Beta-Blockers, and Insomnia

In the U.S. an estimated 22 million people use beta-blockers on a regular basis. As this class of medications suppresses nighttime mel- atonin secretion, it could explain the insomnia linked to this drug.31 Sixteen patients (age 45–64 years) using beta-blockers (i.e., aten- olol or metoprolol) were randomized to receive 2.5 mg melatonin or placebo every night for 3 weeks. In comparison with placebo, weeks of melatonin supplementation significantly increased total sleep time (+36 min; P = 0.046), sleep efficiency (+7.6%; P = 0.046), and reduced sleep onset latency to Stage 2 (-14 min; P = 0.001) as recorded by polysomnography. In addition, and in comparison to placebo, melatonin also significantly increased stage 2 sleep time (+41 min; P = 0.037) but did not alter the duration of other sleep stages.31

## Fibromyalgia

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a challenging condition with characteristic symptoms that include widespread and variable chronic pain, as well as fatigue, stiffness, cognitive disturbances, depression, and insomnia.32 Although alterations in the secretion of melatonin have been observed in FM patients, whether or not this latter phenomenon contributes to the pathophysiology of this disease remains controversial.33 Several studies suggested, however, that melatonin is of value in treating this chronic musculoskeletal condition. Twenty-one female patients (average age 51 years) who met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for primary FM for at least 6 months before their participation in an uncontrolled pilot study were invited to help evaluate the effects of a 3 mg capsule of melatonin 30 minutes before bedtime for 1 month. Of the 21 patients who completed the study, 19 were found to have a significant reduc- tion from baseline in musculoskeletal tender point count (−28.6%), severity of pain (−33.4%), and sleep disturbances (−67.2%) as mea- sured by VAS (P < 0.05). Although fatigue, depression, and anxiety did not show statistical improvement on VAS, the overall physician and patient VAS global treatment assessment scores of FM disease sta- tus (with 10 representing the worst score) improved from 7.6 to 5.7 and 7 to 4.7, respectively. Four patients experienced mild and transient side effects during the trial, including tremor, heartburn, anxiety, and somnolence.34

## 700SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

In another randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 101 patients (6 men, 95 women; 18–65 years) with ACR confirmed primary FM were randomized to one of four treatment groups: (A) 20 mg/day fluoxetine and placebo; (B) 5 mg/day melatonin and pla- cebo; (C) 20 mg/day fluoxetine with 3 mg/day melatonin; and (D) 20 mg/day fluoxetine and 5 mg/day melatonin for 2 months. Using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) to evaluate the clinical outcomes, the researchers determined that compared with baseline, both fluoxetine and melatonin as single therapies significantly reduced within-group symptom scores by 21.5% and 18.9%, respectively (P < 0.05). However, those volunteers combining fluoxetine and mela- tonin at both 3 and 5 mg doses experienced nearly comparable (28.8% vs. 28.9%) and highly significant reductions in their FIQ scores (P < 0.001). Although all treatments reduced FIQ pain scores, it was inter- esting to note the reduction in fatigue scores in groups B, C, and D by 23.7%, 20.3%, and 34.7%, respectively, compared with only 9.9% in the fluoxetine-only treatment group. Fluoxetine as a single agent did not alter the rest/sleep score compared with the significant improve- ments seen in groups B, C, and D.35

## Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Much like FM, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is associated with a number of symptoms, including intense and disabling fatigue that does not improve with rest.36 One of the factors contributing to fatigue and sleep disturbances in CFS is disruption in the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis.37 However, under research scrutiny, both adults and adolescents with CFS have increased levels of melatonin, suggest- ing the hormone has no role to play in this disorder.37 Research on DLMO concluded that a certain subset of CFS patients may respond to the therapeutic use of melatonin. DLMO is a naturally occurring event that may account for delayed sleep phase syndrome in 10% of chronic insomniacs.38 Twenty-nine patients (24 women, 5 men; average age 33.2 years) with CFS were asked to take 5 mg of melatonin at bedtime for months. Using the checklist individual strength (CIS) questionnaire to measure several variables, the authors determined that the total score (P = 0.006), as well as the subscores of fatigue (P = 0.017), concen- tration (P = 0.031), motivation (P = 0.010), and activity (P = 0.008), improved significantly after 90 days of melatonin use. Moreover, those patients with late DLMO (>21.30 hours) overall CIS and its subscores were better than in those CFS patients with early DLMO.39

## Children With Epilepsy

Seizure-free epileptic children (n = 31; 3–12 years of age) with a history of either partial or generalized seizures and using 10 mg/kg per day of sodium valproate participated in a double-blind, place- bo-controlled study of 8 weeks’ duration. The children were ran- domized to receive either melatonin tablets (6 mg for those less than 9 years of age and less than 30 kg body weight or 9 mg for those more than 9 years of age and more than 30 kg body weight, to be taken in the evening) or comparable placebo 1 hour before bedtime. The primary end point of the study was evaluated using the parental Sleep Behavior Questionnaire. By the conclusion of the controlled trial, those children using the additional melatonin had a signifi- cantly greater average percentage reduction in their total sleep scores (24.4%) compared with placebo (14.4%) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the median reduction in the parasomnia scores significantly favored those who took melatonin (60%) relative to the placebo (36.4%) (P < 0.05). No adverse effects were noted during the trial.40 In another placebo-controlled trial, 11 children aged 6 to 11 years with epilepsy were randomized to receive 9 mg of sustained release melatonin or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime for 1 month. At the conclusion of the trial, melatonin decreased mean sleep latency by 11 minutes (P = 0.02) and mean wake after sleep onset (WASO) by 22 minutes (P = 0.04) in contrast to placebo. Sleep diaries revealed that children who employed melatonin slept 11 minutes more (P = 0.1) and woke up 18 minutes later (P = 0.048) in contrast to those employing pla- cebo. Furthermore, and compared with placebo, the use of melatonin increased stage 3 by 5.5% (P = 0.04) and REM latency by 58 minutes (P = 0.04) and decreased REM % by 5.8% (P = 0.01). Melatonin did not alter seizure frequency. Four children reported adverse events while taking melatonin compared with two children on placebo.41

## Autism/Fragile X Syndrome

In a recent review and meta-analysis, the authors noted that children with ASDs not only have a higher incidence of sleep-associated prob- lems, but that melatonin use led to significant improvements in sleep duration and sleep-onset latency compared with placebo (P < 0.01). This poor sleep pattern in turn can lead to a worsening of overall autis- tic behavior symptoms.23 In one double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 18 sub- jects (16 boys, 2 girls; mean age 6 years) with ASD or fragile X syn- drome, or both, and insomnia were randomized to receive 3 mg melatonin or placebo 30 minutes before bedtime for 14 days. After weeks, subjects were crossed over, such that the active group received placebo and vice versa. Children were evaluated using actigraphy and parentally recorded sleep diaries. After 4 weeks and in 12 of 18 children who had complete data sets, the authors noted that those using the melatonin had an improvement in the total night’s average sleep dura- tion (+21 minutes longer than placebo; P = 0.02), a reduction in sleep latency time (28 minutes vs placebo; P = 0.0001), and a 42-minute earlier sleep-onset time in contrast to the placebo group (P = 0.02).42 A controlled clinical trial supports the use of melatonin in children with ASD and neurogenetic disorders (NGD). In this study, 125 chil- dren and adolescents (2–17.5 years of age; 92 males, 33 female consist- ing of 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome) whose sleep did not improve while employing behavioral interventions were random- ized to receive prolonged-release melatonin (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. At the conclusion of the trial, participants who employed sustained-release melatonin slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night compared with 9.14 minutes with placebo (P = 0.034). Moreover, sleep latency (SL) decreased on average by 39.6 minutes on average in the active group and 12.5 minutes with placebo (P = 0.011).43

## Hyperactivity Disorder

Twenty-seven children (6–14 years of age) diagnosed with ADHD and insomnia and employing stimulant medications (i.e., methylpheni- date, dextroamphetamine), participated in a controlled trial. Those subjects who did not respond to a 10-day sleep hygiene regimen were randomized to receive 5 mg of melatonin or placebo 20 minutes before bedtime for 1 month. Compared with the placebo, children who took melatonin had a significant reduction in sleep-onset latency as mea- sured by somnolog (46.4 minutes vs. 62.1 minutes placebo) and actig- raphy (P < 0.01) at the conclusion of the trial. Adverse events were considered mild by the investigators. Melatonin treatment and the subsequent improvement in sleep did not, however, improve ADHD symptoms as noted by Conner’s Attention Deficit Scale, Parent version scores.44 One hundred and five medication-free children (aged 6–12 years) with ADHD were randomized to receive 3 mg of melatonin or 6 mg of melatonin if body weight was less than 30 kg or greater than 30 kg, respectively, or placebo at 7:00 pm for 30 days. Those subjects who used

## 701CHAPTER 92 Melatonin

melatonin had advancements in sleep onset as measured by actigraphy (26.9 ± 47.8 minutes), compared with a delay (10.5 ± 37.4 minutes) in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a significant increase in total sleep time (19.8 ± 61.9 minutes) versus a reduction (13.6 ± 50.6) seen in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Children treated with the active compound showed an advance in DLMO of 44.4 ± 67.9 minutes compared with a delay in children who received the placebo (P < 0.001). No changes were noted in behavior and cognition. Adverse events did not differ between active groups and placebo.45 A long-term 3.7-year follow-up using the same group of children (93% response rate) verified that melatonin use was not associated with any serious side effects but also did not provide a permanent cure for insomnia in ADHD children.46

## Children With Migraine/Tension-Type Headaches

Tension headaches and migraines are two of the more likely reasons that will cause children to complain of pain. Annual prevalence for migraine and tension-type headaches can vary with between a 3% to 11% and a 10% to 24% occurrence, respectively.47 In an uncontrolled pilot study, 22 children (10 boys and 12 girls; age range 6–16 years) with various types of long-standing (average 40.05 ± 30.2 months) headache-type discomfort (13 recurrent migraines/ no aura; 8 chronic tension-type headaches; 1 migraine with aura) par- ticipated in a 12-week study on the effects of oral melatonin. After a 1-month washout period in which all preventive therapy was discon- tinued, the children were asked to take 3 mg of melatonin at bedtime for 90 days. At the conclusion of the study and according to the results of a structured daily headache diary, the frequency (i.e., the number of attacks per month) and the duration of attacks (hours) decreased from 12.3 to 5.7 and 13.5 to 9.7, respectively (P < 0.001). Pragmatically, and as the authors noted, 14 of the 21 subjects (one child stopped the mel- atonin due to excessive somnolence) had a greater than 50% reduction in headache attacks. Notably, four of the children had complete reso- lution of their headaches.48

## Functional Dyspepsia

Postprandial fullness and early satiation, along with epigastric pain and burning without evidence of upper gastrointestinal structural pathol- ogy on endoscopy, are the hallmark of Rome III diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia.49 One group of researchers suggested that melatonin use stimulates enterocytes to produce bicarbonate, which in turn may help neutralize gastric hydrogen chloride and, therefore, reduce symptoms as evidenced by the following study.50 Sixty patients (18 men, 42 women; ages 19–39 years) with a 3- to 12-year history of nonulcer dyspeptic symptoms (i.e., chronic or recurrent epigastric pain) were randomized to receive 5 mg of melatonin or placebo in the evening for 3 months. After 12 weeks of treatment and using a 10-point scale (0 = no symptoms; 10 = maximum symptoms) for therapeutic evaluation, 17 of 30 (56.6%) patients using the melatonin had their condition resolve completely, such that they did not require further treatment, whereas an additional 9 of 30 (30%) patients experienced a partial improvement in symptoms (i.e., reduction in nighttime gastric pain) (P < 0.01). Although 4 patients in the active treatment group noted no change in symptoms, a larger percentage of subjects (93.3%) using placebo noted no change in their condition. The authors noted that those who had a previous infection with Helicobacter pylori were less likely to respond to melatonin treatment.50

## Irritable Bowel Syndrome

It is estimated that 7% to 15% of the U.S. population has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a painful abdominal condition that is primar- ily associated with diarrhea and/or constipation, along with a number of other symptoms, including gas and bloating.51 Recent research showed that the excretion of the urinary metabolite of melatonin (6-sulphatoxymelatonin) was significantly lower in subjects with IBS than controls (P = 0.0004), suggesting that melatonin is involved in the pathogenesis of IBS by acting on the enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract.52 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 18 patients (12 men, 6 women; ages 18–65 years) with IBS were randomized to receive mg of melatonin at bedtime or a matching placebo for 2 months. By the conclusion of the trial, those subjects taking melatonin had a 45% improvement in their overall IBS symptom scores (i.e., pain severity and frequency, bloating) compared with 16.7% in those taking pla- cebo (P < 0.05). Moreover, the extracolonic symptom scores, includ- ing headache, backache, body aches, thigh pain, and lethargy, were significantly lower in the melatonin group compared with pretreat- ment values (P < 0.001) and the placebo group (P < 0.05). Overall, those subjects taking the melatonin experienced an improved quality of life score (43.63%) in contrast to those taking placebo (14.64%) (P < 0.05). Three subjects experienced side effects, including decreased libido and drowsiness.53 In another controlled study, 80 postmenopausal women (mean age 55.3 ± 6.4 years) with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) (n = 40) and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) (n = 40) received 3 mg of melatonin in the morning and 5 mg of melatonin in the evening or a placebo for 6 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a 10-point VAS (mild [1–4 points], moderate [5–7 points], and severe [8–10 points]) along with patient observations recording the changes in visceral pain, abdominal bloating, constipation and/or diarrhea along with a urinary marker (urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin [6-HMS]) of melatonin metabolism. After 6 months of treatment, the researchers determined that in those with IBS-C, there was a negative correlation (r = −0.714) between symptom scores and the excretion of 6-HMS. In contrast, in those patients with IBS-D, this correlation was positive (r = 0.409). As such, only the IBS-C group employing the melatonin had statistically significant reductions in IBS symptoms at both the 4- (P < 0.05) and 6-month (P < 0.01) mark. In the IBS-C group, melatonin decreased the intensity of visceral pain and abdominal bloating in 70% of patients (P < 0.01) and constipation in 50% of patients (P < 0.05).54

## Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

In 2004 it was estimated that 20% of the American population has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is responsible for 64.6 million prescriptions annually.55 According to several studies, mela- tonin is of therapeutic value with or without omeprazole. In this study, 36 individuals with GERD were selected and equally placed into four groups: control; 3 mg melatonin at bedtime; 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily; and 3 mg of melatonin and 20 mg of omepra- zole twice daily for 2 months. After 8 weeks, those using the melatonin alone had a significant reduction in GERD symptoms, increase in lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure (better LES tone), increase in serum gastrin, a reduction in gastric basal acid output, and an increase in serum melatonin levels (P < 0.05). In contrast, although omeprazole was also effective in reducing GERD symptoms (P < 0.05), it did not alter LES tone in a significant fashion. The combination of melatonin and omeprazole had similar results in the single melatonin group, but had a better reduction in basal acid output and an increase in serum gastrin (P < 0.05).56 Individuals (141 men, 210 women; mean age 44 years) with at least one episode of moderate to severe heartburn within the previous week before the onset of treatment within a clinical trial were randomized to receive 6 mg melatonin plus vitamin B 6 (25 mg), vitamin B 12 (50 mcg),

## 702SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

folic acid (10 mg), tryptophan (100 mg), methionine (100 mg), and betaine (100 mg) or one capsule (20 mg) omeprazole per day in the evening for 40 days. After 40 days, individuals using the natural prod- uct combination had 100% reduction in symptoms as measured by a five-point severity scale, compared with the reduction in symptoms seen (65.7%) in the omeprazole group (P < 0.05). As an observation, those 34.3% of the subjects who experienced a persistence of their GERD symptoms with the use of omeprazole had complete resolution of their symptoms after 40 days with the natural combination of vita- mins, melatonin, and amino acids.57 The authors suggested that the efficacy for their combination medication was a result of several factors. Melatonin may block the production of nitric oxide synthase, which may help lower the degree of LES relaxation. Melatonin also stimulates the production of bicar- bonate, which protects against the action of gastric acid production. Moreover, the combination of vitamin B 6 , tryptophan, and vitamin B 12 may decrease acute gastrointestinal pain as a result of serotonin inhibiting the nociceptive system. Methionine and betaine may induce S-adenosyl methionine production, which has both anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.57,58


According to the results of a systemic review, melatonin decreased the risk of death from solid tumors at the 1-year mark.59 This was sup- ported by several independently published articles, primarily by one of the premier researchers on melatonin use and cancer, Professor Paolo Lissoni.

## Nonsmall Cell Metastatic Lung Cancer

One hundred patients (59 men, 41 women; average age 39–81 years) with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) every 21 days for four cycles or chemotherapy plus 20 mg of melatonin in the evening. Patients in the melatonin group continued to use melatonin after chemotherapy cessation. Reviewing the clinical response after 60 to 72 months of fol- low-up, the authors determined that those using the melatonin and chemotherapy combination had a significantly better complete and partial response (35%; 17 of 49 patients) to treatment versus the che- motherapy group (18%; 9 of 51 patients) (P < 0.05). Moreover, a pro- gressive disease state was seen in 20 of 51 patients in the chemotherapy group in contrast to 6 of 49 patients in the chemotherapy/melatonin group (P < 0.01). Side effects of chemotherapy, including neurotox- icity, thrombocytopenia, weight loss of more than 10%, and asthenia, were notably reduced in the melatonin group. Overall 5-year survival rate was significantly longer in those concomitantly treated with mela- tonin (P < 0.001). Three of the 49 patients were still alive 5 years from the date of therapy onset in the combination group, compared with no patients in the chemotherapy alone section.60

## Cell Lung Cancer

Three hundred and seventy patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, or gastric cancer were randomized and treated with the appropriate chemotherapy alone or chemother- apy plus melatonin 20 mg/day in the evening. After 24 months, the overall response rate (complete and partial remission) was higher in the melatonin and chemotherapy group (68 of 167 patients; 36%) versus chemotherapy alone (37 of 183 patients; 20%) (P < 0.001). In addition, the 2-year survival rate in those using melatonin adjunc- tively was better (47 of 187 patients; 25%) versus those employ- ing chemotherapy as a sole treatment (24 of 183 patients; 13%) (P < 0.05).61

## Metastatic Breast Cancer

Melatonin may enhance the effects of the drug tamoxifen according to the results of one preliminary study. Fourteen women (age 42–80 years) with metastatic breast cancer whose breast cancer did not respond to tamoxifen therapy (n = 3) or who had progressed after their disorder had stabilized (n = 11) on tamoxifen participated in this Phase II trial. After a 1-month washout of tamoxifen, patients were given melatonin 20 mg in the evening, 1 week before starting tamox- ifen and 20 mg midday for at least 12 months. Although no complete response to the combination therapy was noted in any of the patients, 28.5% (4 of 14 patients) did achieve a partial response. Moreover, of 14 patients were still alive after 1 year. Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) were reduced in response to the treatment at both 1 (P < 0.05) and 3 months (P < 0.01). Prolactin levels were also reduced from 25 ± 3 ng/ml-1 to 13 ± 2 ng/ml-1 after 12 weeks (P < 0.05). No toxicity was noted.62

## Metastatic Prostate Cancer

Fourteen men (mean age of 71.5 years) with metastatic prostate cancer (tumor grades G2 [n = 9] and G3 [n = 5]) whose pros- tate-specific antigen (PSA) scores had worsened using a combi- nation of triptorelin (3.75 mg intramuscular every 28 days) and flutamide (750 mg/day by mouth for 1 month only) participated in this open clinical trial. After a 30-day washout period in which no triptorelin was given, patients were asked to begin melatonin 20 mg at night 7 days before starting their monthly injections of lutein- izing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog drug. After days, 8 of 14 patients had a greater than 50% reduction in their PSA scores compared with pretreatment values. In addition, aver- age PSA serum concentrations were reduced from a pretreatment value of 421 ± 118 ng/mL to 108 ng/mL (P < 0.05) after 3 months of melatonin and triptorelin. IGF-1 and prolactin serum values were significantly reduced in patients using the combination of the two drugs (P < 0.05).63

## Taxane-Related Neuropathy

Although the two types of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are widely used in oncology, they have several side effects, including neuropa- thy.64 A recent study suggested that melatonin might help with this issue. In this open-label Phase II pilot study, 22 women with breast cancer (33–68 years of age) who underwent chemotherapy with tax- anes were instructed to take 21 mg of melatonin at bedtime for up to 6 months. Using the National Cancer Institute-Cancer Treatment Center’s scale for neuropathy, the authors noted that, “in our trial, patients receiving melatonin during taxane chemotherapy had a reduced incidence of all grade neuropathy (46%) compared with his- torical controls (around 60%).” Fifty-five percent of the patients (n = 11) reported no neuropathy (grade zero). Adverse events included nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. None of the patients reported any inci- dence of daytime sedation.65

## Cachexia

Progressive weight loss, anorexia, and reduction in the body’s cell mass are hallmarks of cancer-related cachexia.66 The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ) plays a role in cancer cachexia accord- ing to the conclusions of one trial. Patients (56 men, 30 women; 39–76 years) with untreatable solid tumors (i.e., breast, colorectal, gastric, nonsmall cell lung cancer, etc.) and metastasis to various sites were stratified according to tumor type and randomized to either standard care (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids for pain) or standard care plus melatonin (20 mg in the evening) for at least months. The authors noted that at the end of 16 weeks, weight loss of

greater than 10% occurred in 32% of the patients treated with conven- tional care versus only 4% of the patients treated with melatonin and conventional care (P < 0.01). Concomitantly with the lower reduction in weight loss, serum values of TNF- α were also significantly lower in patients using the standard care and melatonin compared with the standard care group alone (P < 0.01).67

## Melatonin and Solid Tumor Cancer Therapy: Meta-Analysis

Melatonin has shown to be an effective adjunctive therapy in cancer patients with solid tumors using 20 mg per day. In a meta-analysis, melatonin significantly improved complete and partial remissions (16.5 vs. 32.6%; P < 0.00001) as well as the 1-year survival rate (28.4 vs. 52.2%; P = 0.001). Melatonin use was also associated with a reduction in radio-and chemotherapy-related side effects including thrombocy- topenia (19.7 vs. 2.2%; P < 0.00001), neurotoxicity (15.2 vs. 2.5%; P < 0.0001), and fatigue (49.1 vs. 17.2%; P < 0.00001). No severe adverse events were noted in the randomized control trials.68

## Breast Cancer and Insomnia

Sleep disruptions in those with cancer are a significant clinical issue and require intervention.69 In a controlled trial, 48 patients (aged 30–75 years) scheduled for a lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer were randomized to receive 6 mg of melatonin or placebo 1 hour before bedtime 3 days preoperatively until 2 weeks postoperatively.70 At the conclusion of the trial and according to actigraphy, the admin- istration of oral melatonin significantly improved sleep efficiency (P = 0.007) and reduced wake after sleep onset (P = 0.01) during the entire 14 day postoperative period only.70 No changes were noted with VAS and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale outcomes along with other actigraphy variables.70 A second controlled study found that 95 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who completed active cancer therapy had improved their sleep quality with 3 mg of melatonin or placebo at bed- time over a 4-month time period. Compared with placebo, those who were given melatonin had significantly greater improvements in sub- jective sleep quality as measured by the PSQI score (i.e., −0.1 in the pla- cebo group compared with −1.9 in the melatonin group; P < 0.001).71

## Topical Melatonin and Breast Irradiation Dermatitis

Forty-seven patients median age 54 to 55 years of age with stage 0-II breast cancer treated with radiation therapy were randomized to receive a melatonin-containing emulsion or placebo cream and apply the cream twice a day over the treated breast (not less than 2 hours before radiation treatment) for the 5 weeks during the radiother- apy and 2 weeks thereafter. At the conclusion of the study (2 weeks postradiation), those taking melatonin had favorable results: 59% (13 patients) had no toxicity (grade 0) and 41% (9 patients) had grade 1/2 dermatitis. This is in contrast to the placebo group, which had 11% with grade 0 (2 patients) and 90% with grade 1/2 (17 patients) der- matitis (P = 0.03). Four women treated with melatonin developed a localized and regional cutaneous allergic reaction presenting as macu- lopapular rash that resolved with treatment.72

## Fertility

It is estimated that about 6.1 million women in the U.S. between the ages of 15 to 44 years have difficulty with either becoming pregnant or staying pregnant. Because the success rate with in vitro fertiliza- tions (IVFs) and subsequent pregnancies can vary,73 researchers have considered other options, including melatonin. One hundred fifteen women (24–45 years) who had not become pregnant using IVF were divided into two groups and given 3 mg of melatonin at 10:00 pm from the fifth day of the previous menstrual cycle until the day of oocyte retrieval. Those using the melatonin in conjunction with the second IVF had a higher fertilization rate (50.0 ± 38.0%; P < 0.01) compared with the first IVF trial (20.2 ± 19.0%), with a higher number of preg- nancies (19.6%; 11 of 56 patients) being reported. In contrast, the non- melatonin users had no improvement in their fertilization rates (20.9 ± 16.5% first IVF vs. 22.8 ± 19.0% second IVF), resulting in a lower number of successful pregnancies (10.2%; 6 of 59 patients) during the second IVF-ET trial. The difference between the two groups’ preg- nancy rates was not statistically significant. In an additional analysis of 54 infertile women, it was determined by the authors that 3 mg of melatonin at 10:00 pm or 200 mg of vitamin E (given from the fifth day of the previous menstrual cycle until oocyte retrieval) three times a day significantly decreased the intrafollicular oxidative stress by decreasing the 8-OHdG concentrations compared with the first IVF cycle (P < 0.05).74 Forty-six infertile women (38–42 years of age) who had not con- ceived previously using IVF were recruited to receive 2 g of myoinosi- tol plus 200 mg of folic acid in the morning and the latter combination in the evening plus 3 mg of melatonin daily for 90 days. After 3 months of using the treatment, a second cycle of IVF was instituted, resulting in a significant improvement in the number of embryos (0.48 ± 0.51 vs. 0.80 ± 0.69; P = 0.01) and the quality of the embryos transferred (0.13 ± 0.48 vs. 0.35 ± 0.48; P = 0.01). The implantation rate during the second IVF cycle was 22.8% compared with 0% in the initial IVF cycle, resulting in 13 pregnancies. Four of the 13 pregnancies were not successful and spontaneously aborted.75


Although 6 mg of slow release melatonin for 4 weeks did not show sig- nificant improvement in major depressive disorder symptoms, some individuals may benefit from melatonin use, such as those with depres- sion and delayed sleep phase syndrome and women during perimeno- pause or menopause.76

## Depression and Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 13 men (age 35.6 ± 14 years) and 7 women (aged 30.8 ± 12.4 years) with established delayed sleep phase syndrome were divided into groups: those with (group I; n = 8; 3 men and 5 women) or without depression (group II; n = 12; 4 women and 8 men) based on a clinical assessment and the results of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Patients were randomly assigned to either 5 mg of melatonin or placebo and asked to consume the medication between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm for 4 weeks followed by a 1-week washout before treatment crossover for another 4 weeks. Those in group I had a significant reduction in their HDRS and CES-D scores in comparison to placebo (P < 0.05). Moreover, according to polysomnographic results, sleep-onset latency was reduced in both groups I and II compared with both placebo and baseline measures (P = 0.03).77

## Depression in Menopause/Perimenopause

Women with either perimenopause (n = 36), premenopause (n = 25), and postmenopause (n = 18), ranging in age from 42 to 62 years, were divided into two age groups (42–49 years and 50–62 years) and given either 3 mg of synthetic melatonin or placebo at bedtime between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm for 6 months. Subjects were evaluated for sal- ivary melatonin and serum levels of several hormones, including thy- roid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, T4, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone at time 0, 3, and 6 months. After 6 months of treatment, melatonin use significantly increased T3 and T4 (P < 0.0001) com- pared with time 0. The placebo group also had increases in T3 after

months (P < 0.05) but not at 6 months. TSH was not affected by either treatment group. Melatonin use also reduced plasma LH levels in the younger group of women (28.6%) but not in the older group (P < 0.05). FSH levels were also significantly reduced, especially in women with low basal melatonin levels (P < 0.05). In contrast to placebo, women who took melatonin had an improvement in their mood state, with only 6.7% of the active group reporting morning depression com- pared with 21% of the placebo users (P < 0.05).78

## Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is a growing concern both in the U.S. and throughout the global community. It is estimated that there were 24.3 million people worldwide with dementia in 2001, and that this figure would rise to 81.1 million by the year 2040.79 Similarly in America, AD is expected to increase to an estimated 13 million by the year 2050.80 In addition to a deterioration in memory and day-to-day functioning, sundowning syndrome or nocturnal delirium are a common behav- ior, found in 2.4% to 25%, respectively, of those diagnosed with AD.81 Sundowning can occur typically between 3:00 pm and 7:10 pm and is associated with a heightened degree of agitation, irritation, and con- fusion.82 Because this problem can cause great distress for both care- givers and health care professionals, several researchers noted that sundowning is a form of circadian rhythm disturbance, and that the associated delirium would respond well to melatonin.83

## Sundowning Phenomenon in Alzheimer’s Disease

In a retrospective study, 14 patients (8 women, 6 men; average age years) diagnosed with AD received 9 mg melatonin daily at bedtime for 22 to 35 months. The researchers concluded that although mela- tonin use significantly improved their sleep quality (P = 0.001), none of the other neuropsychiatric test parameters (i.e., Functional Assessment Staging [FAST] or Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale [ADAS]) showed any difference between initial and final assessment. However, the condition of sundowning was no longer clinically detectable in of 14 patients. Moreover, the melatonin users did not exhibit the typical cognitive and behavioral deterioration normally seen in these patients over a 1- to 3-year evolution of dementia. No side effects were noted.84 In a preliminary pilot study, 11 nursing home participants (8 women, 3 men; 79–82 years) with dementia received one 3 mg tablet of melatonin in the evening for 3 weeks. Using the Nurses Ratings of Sleep Patterns Questionnaire as an assessment tool, sleepiness during the daytime hours (how long and how often the residents napped) was significantly reduced (P = 0.0245 and P = 0.0105), but no changes were noted in the evening or nighttime hours. Frequency of agitation, as recorded by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, was signifi- cantly reduced in five subjects (P = 0.05), especially during the evening hours when sundowning is most prevalent.85

## Alzheimer’s Dementia

In this randomized controlled trial, 20 patients with confirmed AD (3 men, 17 women; 67–90 years of age) were randomized to receive either 3 mg of melatonin or placebo at 8:30 pm daily for 1 month. In those using the melatonin, actigraphic data demonstrated that the melatonin users had an increase in the amount of mean evening sleep time (33.2 ± 37.6%) compared with a reduction in placebo users (0.2 ± 13.7%) (P = 0.017). Similarly, there was a reduction in the nighttime activity counts in the active group (−44.9 ± 21.9%) compared with the increase (29.8 ± 77%) seen with placebo use (P = 0.014). There was no change in daytime sleep or activity between the two groups. Those using the melatonin also had a significantly improved ADAS cognition and non- cognition scores (−4.3 ± 3.6 and −4.1 ± 2.2) versus placebo (−0.3 ± 3.7 and −0.8 ± 1.0), respectively (P = 0.017 and P = 0.002).86 In another controlled study, 80 patients (50.7% women; 49.3% men; average age 75.3 years) diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia with or without insomnia and receiving stan- dard therapy (i.e., acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized to receive 2 mg of pro- longed release melatonin or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. Overall and at the conclusion of the trial (24 weeks), those patients treated with prolonged release melatonin had signifi- cantly better cognitive performance than placebo, as measured by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) (P = 0.004) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (P = 0.044). Sleep efficiency (as measured by the PSQI subscale 4) was also improved with the use of the prolonged release melatonin (P = 0.017). Mean AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) scores did not differ between the groups. On further analysis of the comorbid insomnia (PSQI ≥ 6) subgroup, the use of prolonged-release melatonin resulted in significantly differ- ent outcomes versus the placebo in mean IADL (P = 0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 vs. −3 points) (P = 0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P = 0.04). Moreover, the reduction in median ADAS-Cog values in the active group (−3.5) were significantly better than placebo (+3 points) (P = 0.045). Adverse events that were noted during were not considered to be related to the use of prolonged release melatonin.87

## Migraine

Individuals with chronic migraines have decreased levels of urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin levels, supporting melatonin’s role in the pathophysiology of migraine. In an open study, 34 patients (29 men, 5 women) with episodic migraines were given 3 mg of melatonin minutes before bedtime for 3 months. Compared with baseline and after 12 weeks of therapy, melatonin use decreased headache fre- quency, intensity, and duration (P < 0.001). Complete resolution of the migraine was seen in 25% of the patients. The use of medication (i.e., analgesics and triptan) for the treatment of migraine was also reduced (P < 0.001).88 These promising initial results were confirmed in a placebo-controlled trial comparing melatonin with amitriptyline for migraine prevention. One hundred and seventy-eight men (n = 83) and women (n = 95) (average age 36.6–37.2 years) with two to eight migraine attacks per month were randomized to one of three groups for 12 weeks: placebo, melatonin 3 mg, or amitriptyline 25 mg taken at bedtime. After 3 months of treatment and compared with placebo, both melatonin and amitriptyline significantly reduced the number of days with migraine headaches by 1.6 and 1.1 days, respectively (P < 0.05). The mean attack duration was also reduced by 4.8 hours in the melatonin group and by 4.4 hours in the amitriptyline group in contrast to placebo (−2.5 hours) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the number of analgesic medications and headache intensity were reduced similarly in both active groups. However, the proportion of responders (defined as patients with a higher than 50% improvement in headache fre- quency along with the number of migraine-associated headache days) was superior in the melatonin group (54.4%) versus amitriptyline (39.1%) (P < 0.05) and placebo (20.4%) (P < 0.01). During the course of the trial, there were no serious adverse events. Daytime sleepiness, dry mouth, gastralgia, weight gain, and constipation were the most common side effects reported by the participants.89

## Cluster Headache

Twenty cluster headache (2 chronic; 18 episodic) patients (15 men, 5 women; 30–40 years) who met the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria were invited to participate in this trial. After a 1-week washout period in which prophylactic treatment was stopped, patients were randomized to receive 10 mg of melatonin in the evening or

placebo for 14 days. Those employing the melatonin had a signifi- cant reduction in daily attacks, from 3.31 to 1.51, by the end of week 2 (P < 0.03). There was also an observed decrease in daily analgesic use by the melatonin group, but this was not statistically significant (P < 0.06). Additionally, and in contrast to placebo, headache frequency was reduced in both the first (P < 0.03) and second weeks of melatonin treatment (P = 0.01). However, the 2 chronic cluster headache patients did not respond to melatonin use. The authors speculated that mela- tonin could act by modulating 5HT2 receptors, inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin E 2 , or increase the activation threshold level of amino- butyric acid pain pathways.90

## Primary Headache (Tension and Migraine)

In this open clinical trial, 49 patients (11 men, 38 women; average age range 38.65–45.25 years) (12 with chronic tension-type headache and 37 with migraine) were given 4 mg of prolonged release melatonin, 30 minutes before bedtime for 6 months. At the termination of the study, melatonin had a favorable effect on attack frequency, reducing the number of migraine and tension headache episodes from baseline 4.72 ± 0.73 and 15.91 ± 6.88 (P = 0.033) to 2.18 ± 0.84 and 5.33 ± 2.57 (P < 0.001), respectively. The Headache Impact Test score (HIT) mea- suring quality of life was significantly reduced in both tension type (P = 0.002) and migraine headaches (P < 0.001).91

## Tinnitus

A perception of a ringing or roaring or a humming sound within the ears without any acoustic stimulation is known as tinnitus.92 It was speculated by researchers that melatonin could assist in the reduction of tinnitus symptoms by reducing labyrinth pressure.93 Based on case reports in which melatonin use symptomatically improved tinnitus patients, one group of medical investigators embarked on a dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 30 patients (15 men, 8 women; average age 64.4 years) with this condition. Patients were randomized to either 3 mg of melatonin 1 to 2 hours before bedtime or placebo for 30 days. After a 7-day washout, patients were crossed over for another 30 days. Of the 23 patients who completed the study, there was no statistical difference between active and placebo groups in terms of Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) scores. However, those melatonin users (n = 9) with an initial pretreatment THI score of 47.6 and who reported an overall improvement in their symptoms had significantly higher than the average pretreatment scores (25.1) com- pared with melatonin users (n = 14) who did not respond to therapy (P = 0.02). This suggests that patients with higher initial THI scores are more likely to respond to melatonin use. In addition, 7 of 15 patients who reported difficulty in falling asleep secondary to tinnitus symp- toms were able to fall asleep more readily, in contrast to only 3 of patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04). Bad dreams were noted as a side effect in 17% of both the active and placebo users.94 A controlled trial employing 102 subjects with tinnitus deter- mined that only the combination of 3 mg melatonin in the evening with a sulodexide (250 mg twice daily for 40 days; then 250 mg/day for another 40 days) significantly improved their symptoms as measured by THI scores and acufenometry evaluation compared with melatonin alone.95 Melatonin’s effectiveness is confirmed in adults with chronic tinni- tus according to the results of a prospective randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial. In this study participants (n = 61) were ran- domized to 3 mg oral melatonin or placebo on a nightly basis for month followed by a 30-day washout period and then each group was crossed over into the opposite arm. At the conclusion of the trial, in those taking melatonin, there was a significantly greater reduction in both audiometric tinnitus matching (TM) and Self Rated Tinnitus (SRT) scores (P < 0.05) from baseline in contrast to the placebo group. The authors note that, “melatonin is most effective in men, those with- out a history of depression, those who have not undergone prior tinni- tus treatments, those with more severe and bilateral tinnitus, and those with a history of noise exposure.”96

## Melatonin, Zinc, and Type 2 Diabetes: Lipid and

<!-- chunk -->

## Glycemic Control

Type 2 diabetes is a global epidemic and the number of those afflicted with this disorder has quadrupled over the past 3 decades.97 Although there are many therapeutic options, melatonin and zinc may be of value in stabilizing blood glucose and reducing cardiovascular risk in this population group. In one randomized controlled trial, 46 patients (21 men, 25 women aged 40–64 years) with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control using metformin were selected and allocated into three groups: group A (n = 15) dietary changes and 10 mg of met- formin per day and placebo; group B (n = 18) dietary changes and mg of melatonin plus 50 mg of zinc acetate per day plus 10 mg of mela- tonin per day; or group C (n = 13) dietary changes along with 10 mg of melatonin plus 50 mg of zinc acetate per day for 3 months. Seventeen healthy subjects (9 males and 8 females) in the same age range as that of patients served as controls. At the conclusion of the trial, group A patients had a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels (9%) after 90 days (P < 0.01), whereas hemoglobin A1C (HbA 1c ) had a significant reduction (P < 0.01) after 30 days of treatment (14%) but did not change at 90 days in contrast to baseline. Group B had a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in fasting plasma glucose (25%) and HbA 1C (17%) levels after both 30 days of treatment. In this latter group, glycated hemoglobin levels showed a further 26% reduction after 3 months. Compared with base- line, Group C treatment resulted in a 23% decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels after 90 days (P < 0.01) along with a 15% and 29% reduction (P < 0.01) in HbA 1C levels after 30 and 90 days, respectively. C peptide levels did not change in any of the three groups (P > 0.05). Comparative analysis determined that the adjunct use of melatonin and zinc with metformin (group B) produces the highest reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels compared with the other tested groups (P < 0.05).98 Using the same study design noted previously, the combination of zinc and melatonin with or without metformin resulted in improve- ments in lipid levels. Overall and after 90 days, both group B and group C had significant reductions (P < 0.01) in total cholesterol levels (14% and 11%, respectively), compared with group A, which had elevations in total cholesterol (13%). Compared with baseline, group A recorded a 7% increase in triglycerides whereas groups B (−18%) and C (−21%) had a reduction in triglycerides after 3 months of treatment (P < 0.05). In addition, groups B (+47%) and C (+32%) had a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with baseline (P < 0.01). Although low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels did not change in group A, both groups B and C recorded a decrease of and 26%, respectively, in contrast to baseline (P < 0.01). Treatment with melatonin and zinc plus metformin (group B) or melatonin and zinc (group C) resulted in significant reduction in microalbuminuria (MAU) (−37 and −36%, respectively), compared with baseline (P < 0.01).99

## Metabolic Syndrome

In a clinical study, 33 patients (12 men, 18 women) with metabolic syn- drome who had not responded to 3 months of lifestyle changes were given 5 mg of melatonin 2 hours before bedtime for 2 months. After month of treatment and compared with baseline, those with metabolic syndrome had a significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2)

(P < 0.05), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) (P < 0.01), diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.05), thiobarbituric acid reactive sub stances (um/gHb) (P < 0.05), and an increase in fibrinogen levels (P < 0.05). At the 60-day mark, there was no change in BMI or fibrinogen levels, but the results showed a decrease in LDL-C (P < 0.05) along with further reductions in systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.01) blood pressures. There was also a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (P < 0.01) and an increase in catalase (U/g Hb) (P < 0.01).100

## Atopic Dermatitis (AD) in Children

In this controlled clinical trial, 48 subjects (median age, 7 years; age range, 1.8–17.1 years) with atopic dermatitis and sleep disturbances were ran- domized to receive 3 mg of melatonin or placebo at bedtime for 4 weeks. Melatonin treatment not only resulted in a decrease of the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index by 9.1 compared with placebo (P < 0.001), but also a reduction of the sleep-onset latency by 21.4 minutes (P = 0.02). No side effects were noted from the use of melatonin.101

## Cataract Surgery

Forty patients (21 men 19 women aged 68.5–72.8 years) scheduled for cataract surgery were randomized to receive 10 mg of oral melatonin or placebo 90 minutes before surgery. Compared with the placebo group, those employing the melatonin had significant reductions in anxiety after premedication (P = 0.04) and intraoperatively (P = 0.005). Pain scores were significantly lower in the melatonin group than in the control group at the end of surgery (6 minutes; P < 0.002) and in the recovery room (7 minutes; P < 0.032). The authors note that there was a lower need for fentanyl during surgery as 15 patients in the con- trol group and only 7 patients in the melatonin group required addi- tional fentanyl boluses (P = 0.007). In addition, intraocular pressure decreased in the melatonin group and this reduction was maintained until the end of the surgical procedure (P < 0.001). Adverse events were minimal, with 1 patient in the melatonin group complaining of dizziness, and another patient in the control group had nausea.102

## BMI, Melatonin, Fluoxetine, and Postmenopausal

<!-- chunk -->

## Women

Sixty-four women, aged 54 to 65 years with a BMI approximately (kg/height in m2), were randomly allocated into two groups: Group I (n = 30) was administered fluoxetine (1 × 20 mg in the morning) and placebo (in the evening) for 6 months. Group II (n = 34), in contrast, was given fluoxetine (1 × 20 mg in the morning) and melatonin (5 mg in the evening) for 6 months. Although both groups were effective in improving anxiety and decreasing depression scores from baseline, there were no significant differences between groups. However, in group II taking the fluoxetine combined with melatonin, the improvement of the sleep quality index was faster and resulted in highly statistically signifi- cant reductions from 15.8 ± 2.4 points to 9.4 ± 2.0 points (P < 0.01) after 12 weeks and 7.7 ± 1.5 points (P < 0.001) after 15 weeks. In group I, the sleep quality index in group decreased from 14.9 ± 2.5 points to 12.9 ± 2.6 points after 12 weeks (P < 0.05) and to 10.9 ± 1.9 points after weeks (P < 0.01). In group II, the BMI decreased non-significantly from 30.9 ± 3.1 to 29.6 ± 2.8 (P > 0.05) after 12 weeks decreased significantly to 26.3 ± 3.2 (P < 0.05) after 24 weeks. By comparison, in group I, BMI decreased slightly from 30.1 ± 3.5 to 28.5 ± 2.9 (P > 0.05), but after weeks, the BMI returned to the baseline value of 29.5 ± 3.1 (P > 0.05).103

## Nicotine Withdrawal

Despite the fact that smoking is strongly associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, many individuals continue to smoke.104 One of the factors contributing to engaging in smoking cessation is the symptoms associated with acute nicotine withdrawal. In one study, 12 subjects (19–53 years) who had smoked on an average for 3 to 27 years were given 0.3 mg of melatonin or placebo at 11:30 pm on the second night of the experiment, 3.5 hours after nicotine with- drawal. Those using the melatonin had significant reductions in VAS self-rating scores for anxiety (P < 0.01), irritability (P = 0.001), anger (P < 0.05), and craving for cigarettes (P < 0.005), compared with placebo.105

## Vascular Protection in Smokers

In this controlled study, 63 volunteers (46 men, 17 women; average age 31.7–34.6 years) were split into two groups (smokers and non- smokers) and then randomly divided into four groups: (a) nonsmoker with oral placebo (n = 15); (b) nonsmoker with oral melatonin (n = 16); (c) smoker with oral placebo (n = 17); and (d) smoker with oral melatonin (n = 15). Each group was given 3 mg/day of melatonin or placebo 1 hour before bedtime for 2 weeks. Compared with placebo group, melatonin not only lowered the concentration of fibrinogen (P = 0.04) and free fatty acids (P = 0.04) but also decreased the expres- sion of the markers for vascular injury including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (P = 0.004), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (P = 0.001), and endothelin-1 (P < 0.0001) in smokers.106

## Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis

In this preliminary study, 42 patients with histologically confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were asked to consume 2 x 5 mg of mela- tonin (n = 30) or placebo (n = 12) daily for 12 weeks. All patients were enrolled in a lifestyle program consisting of walking for 30 to 60 min/ day along with dietary interventions. In those taking the melatonin, alanine aminotransferase (IU/L) levels decreased significantly from 118.0 (79.2–158.5) at baseline to 66.0 (55.0– 79.5) at week 12 (P < 0.001). In contrast, alanine aminotransferase (IU/L) levels in the placebo group also decreased significantly from 120.0 (81.3– 135.0) at baseline to 83.5 (70.7–100.0) at week 12 (P < 0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase levels (IU/L) decreased significantly in only the mela- tonin group from 76.5 (64.2–114.2) at baseline to 47.0 (38.2–58.7) at week 12 (P < 0.001). In addition, and unlike placebo, the melatonin group had significant reductions in gamma-glutamyl transferase (IU/L) from (75.8–210.8) at baseline to 60 (47.3–85.3) by week 12 (P < 0.001).107

## Ulcerative Colitis

Sixty patients (38 women and 22 men, aged 26–49 years) with left-sided ulcerative colitis who were in clinical remission for the past 12 months were divided into two equal groups of 30 patients. Patients were given the drug mesalazine in daily doses 2 x 1.0 g and melatonin 5 mg daily at bedtime (group I) or placebo (group II) for 1 year. At the end of the study, using the Mayo Clinic Disease Activity Index (MCDAI) score, group I increased from 1.50 ± 0.51 at baseline to 2.75 ± 1.86 points (P < 0.01) compared with placebo, which had significantly higher MCDAI (1.61 ± 0.68 points to 5.10 ± 2.22 points) scores (P < 0.05). Similarly, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the melatonin group remained within the normal range (from 3.49 ± 1.40–4.1 ± 72.10 mg/ dL) in contrast to placebo, which increased from 3.85 ± 1.29 to 13.13 ± 6.08 mg/dL (P < 0.01). Additionally, in the placebo group, there was a significant reduction in serum hemoglobin from 12.05 ± 0.69 to 10.93 ± 0.81 g/dL. In comparison, the melatonin group experienced a slight decrease in serum hemoglobin levels from 12.29 ± 0.87 to 11.76 ± 1.09 g/dL (P < 0.01). Although there was a strong placebo effect, melatonin may have value in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.108


Melatonin has been used at a variety of different dosages as described in the Clinical Applications section. For its most popular use to enhance

## 707CHAPTER 92 Melatonin

sleep quality the typical dosage is 3 mg 30 to 45 minutes before bedtime. Dosage ranges for the clinical applications are given in Table 92.1. In general, use the same dosage level used in the positive clinical studies for the specific application.

<!-- chunk -->

## Side Effects and Contraindications

Common side effects of high dosage melatonin use include head- aches, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness.109 One author notes that, “despite the well-recognized role of melatonin in the regulation of reproduction in photoperiodic species, it seems unlikely that chronic ingestion of moderate melatonin doses will have a profound impact on reproductive function in humans.”110 However, without further clini- cal evidence of safety, melatonin should not be employed in pregnancy and lactation. One study in women noted that high-dose melatonin (300 mg/day for 4 months) could significantly reduce mean LH levels in contrast to nonmedicated controls (P < 0.001) (see Table 92.1).111


Although melatonin overall has an excellent safety record, clinicians should be cognizant of several drug interactions, especially zolpidem and melatonin.

<!-- chunk -->

## Zolpidem

In a controlled study, 16 healthy subjects (12 men, 4 women; average age 59.4 years) were randomized to receive placebo, 2 mg prolonged release melatonin, 10 mg zolpidem, or both active medications for 2 days in the evenings (8:00 pm) with a 2- to 10-day washout period between treat- ments. Psychomotor functions (i.e., reaction time, vigilance), memory, dexterity, sedation, and simulated car driving were evaluated at 1 to hours, the next morning after drug administration. The results demon- strated that compared with placebo, PR melatonin on its own did not impair any of the variables tested. However, the use of zolpidem and zolpidem with PR melatonin significantly impaired memory and psy- chomotor performance 1 to 4 hours after administration. In a simulated driving task, the number of collisions significantly increased at the 1- to 4-hour mark by 1.4 and 2.8 in the zolpidem (P < 0.05) and zolpidem-PR melatonin (P < 0.001) groups compared with placebo, respectively. No changes were noted by the investigators the next morning, except that the decline in memory recall was still evident with zolpidem.112

<!-- chunk -->

## Fluvoxamine

The bioavailability of melatonin is increased by the coadminis- tration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. When 50 mg of fluvoxamine was used in concert with 5 mg of mel- atonin, on average, there was a seventeenfold increase (P < 0.05) in the area under concentration-time curve (AUC) and a twelvefold higher (P < 0.01) serum peak concentration (C max ) of melatonin. The terminal elimination half-life was not significantly affected.113

<!-- chunk -->

## Fluoxetine

Melatonin was employed in concert with fluoxetine to reduce the inci- dence of dyskinesia. In a case report, one 23-year-old male with obses- sive-compulsive disorder and major depression developed shoulder and neck dyskinesia after taking 60 mg fluoxetine for 4 months. Because the patient and the doctors did not want to stop the medication, which had proven clinically helpful, they added 6 mg of melatonin twice a day. Within 2 weeks the dyskinesia resolved. Secondary to experiencing day- time drowsiness, the patient discontinued the melatonin with a reap- pearance and worsening of the dyskinesia. Resumption of the melatonin 6 mg at nighttime again resolved the problem within 2 weeks of onset. The authors noted that the antioxidant effects of melatonin might help scavenge the toxic free radicals that may trigger dyskinesia.114

<!-- chunk -->

## Caffeine

Caffeine intake can affect the bioavailability of melatonin, which is likely caused by the inhibition of CYP1A2 activity. In 12 healthy volunteers, when 600 mg of caffeine was coadministered with mg of melatonin, the C max and AUC of melatonin were increased on average by 142% (P = 0.001) and 120% (P < 0.001), respec- tively. The inhibitory effect of caffeine was more pronounced in nonsmokers and in individuals with the *1F/*1F genotype.115

# CYP1A

As melatonin is metabolized by CYP1A in vitro, there are a number of potential drug interactions that could occur, including coadmin- istration of acetaminophen, omeprazole, theophylline, warfarin, and estradiol. Caution should be exercised by clinicians when administer- ing melatonin and prescription medications metabolized by CYP1A.116

<!-- chunk -->

## Progesterone

In women, 300 mg melatonin and 75 mg of melatonin combined with 0.3 mg of the synthetic progestin norethisterone caused a significant decrease in LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels compared with a nonmedicated control group in the first and fourth months of the investigation (P < 0.05). This strongly suggests that melatonin and progesterone have an additive effect and should not be used by women taking progesterone.117

complement and protein synthesis. Various extracts of these constitu- ents show similar properties and antithyroid effects.

## Sedative Effects

Animal studies confirmed that lemon balm has a calming effect. For instance, a tincture of lemon balm was sedative, analgesic, and hyp- notic in mice and potentiated phenobarbital.11 In vitro studies on human neurons with ethanolic extracts of lemon balm showed that it has cholinergic activity.12

## Antiviral Effects

Lemon balm consistently showed antiviral and antiretroviral effects in vitro, particularly against herpes simplex virus but also against HIV-1.13–16 The volatile oil of lemon balm was active against Trypanosoma brucei but had minimal activity against Leishmania major.17

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Effects

Lemon balm has diverse effects on the thyroid gland and thyroid hor- mones. It inhibits rat iodothyronine deiodinase and prevents bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from stimulating human thyroid membranes in vitro.18,19 The latter effect was a result of adduct forma- tion between polyphenols and TSH, thereby preventing TSH recep- tor binding. Adducts also formed with immunoglobulin-G antibodies formed in patients with Graves’ disease, which mimicked TSH, block- ing their binding to the TSH receptor in vitro.20

## Other Effects

Preliminary investigations suggest a wealth of other miscellaneous effects: rosmarinic acid inhibited C3 and C5 convertases, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect.21,22 Lemon balm flavonoids show potent antiperoxidative activity.23 Lemon balm was antiulcerogenic in rats in one trial, both alone and in combination with various other herbs.24

## Herpes Simplex Virus

Two clinical trials investigated the effect of lemon balm on herpes labialis lesions. In one double-blind trial, 116 patients with an acute outbreak of herpes were randomly assigned to receive treatment with a cream containing a 70:1 extract of lemon balm or placebo.25 Redness was reduced more in the lemon balm group, but other symptoms were not significantly different from the placebo group. No major adverse effects occurred in either group. In a second double-blind trial, 66 patients were randomly assigned to apply either a lemon balm cream or placebo.26 Average daily symp- tomatic relief was significantly better in those given lemon balm. Other measures of efficacy were not significantly different between the groups, although there was a consistent trend in favor of lemon balm.

## Anxiety, Agitation, Insomnia, Memory

Lemon balm has been studied in people with mild anxiety and as a relaxant in healthy people. In a double-blind study, 102 individuals with mild anxiety were randomly assigned to receive either a lemon balm combination product or placebo for 8 weeks.27 Those taking the lemon balm product had significantly less overall anxiety, nervousness, excitability, and emotional lability than subjects taking the placebo. In a study of 24 healthy individuals, a mixture of lemon balm and Valeriana officinalis (valerian) had a dose-dependent anxiolytic effect.28 Another randomized, double-blind crossover trial administered varying doses of lemon balm extract to 20 healthy individuals.29 At lower doses, lemon balm had a calming effect, and at moderate doses, it increased alertness, an effect lost at the highest dose tested. In vitro investigations suggested that these results might have been mediated by the cholinergic effects of lemon balm constituents. A combination product of valerian, passion flower, lemon balm, and butterbur extracts (Ze 185) was administered to 72 healthy men in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with three par- allel groups (Ze 185, placebo, or no treatment) for 4 days. The active treatment did not affect salivary cortisol levels but significantly attenu- ated the subjective anxiety response to a stress test.30 A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 100 female teenagers) found that lemon balm capsules (600 mg/2 capsules/day for 3 months) improved the psychosomatic symptoms score, anxiety, depression, sleep, and “social function disorder” significantly com- pared with a placebo.31 In a double-blind study of 72 patients with clinically severe agita- tion and severe dementia, lemon balm lotion applied topically twice daily significantly reduced agitation compared with a sunflower oil placebo.32 Lemon balm oil, placebo, and donepezil were not found to have a significant sedative effect in a rigorous multicenter study of Alzheimer’s patients with severe agitation (n = 81).33 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-month trial of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) found a highly significant improvement in all four dimen- sions of the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) in those getting an herbal formula containing lemon balm. However, the exact formula was not provided, and it appears that other herbs (e.g., Paeonia lac- tiflora, Withania somnifera, Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, and Spirulina platensis) that could plausibly improve ADHD were present in greater amounts in the formula.34 Young children (>12 y.o., n = 914) diagnosed with pathologi- cal restlessness and/or nervous dyssomnia participated in an open, multicenter study of a mixture of 160 mg valerian and 80 mg lemon balm per tablet. For 4 to 5 weeks, each child took between 1 and tablets per day, and the core symptoms of restlessness and dyssomnia improved significantly. There were no adverse events related to the test medicine.35 A study of 24 children compared a lemon balm tincture with a pla- cebo over a month’s time and found it did not reduce muscle activity in children with bruxism.36 In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of healthy adults older than 40 years (n = 44), 5 mL of a tincture of salvia (Salvia officinalis), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), and lemon balm did CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 O O GeranialNeral H 3 CH 3 C

not differ from placebo in either immediate or delayed word recall, although a somewhat younger subgroup showed some improvements in verbal episodic memory.37 A double-blind trial in 98 individuals with mild insomnia com- pared a combination of valerian root and lemon balm with placebo for 1 month.38 The extract was significantly more effective than placebo in improving subjectively rated sleep quality, although recordings of sleep quality on a visual analog scale did not show any differences between the two groups. A similar combination product had a positive action in a study of 918 children with restlessness and dyssomnia.39 Lemon balm was approved by the German Commission E for the treatment of nervous sleeping disorders.40 One hundred women (50–60 years old) with a score of ≥ 5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were randomized to take either 2 cap- sules daily containing 160 mg of valerian and 80 mg of lemon balm or starch in a triple-blinded approach. One month postintervention, a statistically significant improvement in sleep was noted.41

## Premenstrual Syndrome

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of high school girls (n = 100) found that 1200 mg of lemon balm “essence” daily from day 1 to the last day of their menstrual cycle for three cycles signifi- cantly reduced premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms.42

## Dyspepsia and Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Lemon balm leaf was approved by the German Commission E for the treatment of dyspepsia and possibly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).40 No clinical trials documenting the efficacy of lemon balm alone for digestive disorders could be found. All trials included lemon balm only as a component of herbal combination products. A systematic review of the formula Iberogast I (Iberogast, in addition to lemon balm, contains Iberis amara [bitter candytuft], Matricaria recutita [chamomile], Mentha x piperita [peppermint], Carum carvi [caraway], Glycyrrhiza glabra [lico- rice], Angelica archangelica [garden angelica], Chelidonium majus [greater celandine], and Silybum marianum [milk thistle]) found the formula efficacious in dyspepsia.43 Another preliminary study of 32 patients with IBS found that a mixture of lemon balm, Mentha spicata (spearmint), and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) reduced abdominal pain and bloating.44 In infants, a mixture of lemon balm, Matricaria recutita (chamomile), and Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) reduced colic symptoms.45 Although these tri- als did not address the efficacy of lemon balm in isolation, they do support the historical use of lemon balm in patients with dyspepsia or IBS.

## Infantile Colic

In a multicenter randomized comparative study, 176 infants with colic were given 1 mL of a mixture of lemon balm, chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.), and Lactobacillus acidophilus,46 108 units of L. reuteri DSM 17938 in 5 mL oil, or 60 mg of simethicone daily for 28 days. The herbal mixture and the probiotic treatment were equally effective and superior to simethicone in reducing the mean daily crying time.47

In a parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol [TC] = 200–260 mg/mL, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] = 100–160 mg/dL) took 1000 mg of lemon balm leaf or starch placebo 3×/day for 2 months. LDL decreased significantly, as did aspartate aminotransferases. No changes were seen in other tested serum parameters.48

## Arterial Stiffness

In an open-label, parallel-group, comparative trial, 28 healthy indi- viduals drank 200 mL/day of lemon balm or barley tea for 6 weeks. The improved brachial ankle pulse wave velocity in the active group suggests that lemon balm tea may reduce arterial stiffness, especially in those with significant stiffness. Lemon balm tea also suppressed the reduction of skin elasticity in female test subjects and generally appeared to improve glycation-associated tissue damage.49

## Cardiac Palpitations

Individuals (n = 55) with benign palpitations received 500 mg of freeze-dried lemon balm twice daily for 14 days in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Lemon balm signifi- cantly reduced the frequency and self-reported intensity of episodes of palpitations compared with placebo.50

## Radiation Protection

In a single open study, workers in a medical radiology department used lemon balm tea (1.5 g in 100 mL water twice per day) for days.51 Plasma catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione levels rose, whereas DNA damage, myeloperoxidase, and lipid peroxidation product levels all fell significantly compared with baseline. Controlled trials are warranted in people exposed to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation.


Lemon balm is traditionally employed as a tea or tincture. The dried leaf should still smell strongly of lemon and should be dark green; if not, it is of inferior quality. For a tea, 2 to 3 teaspoons of herb are steeped in 1 cup hot water for 10 to 15 minutes; three cups of this are drunk daily.51 The dose of a tincture, made preferably from fresh mate- rial and as concentrated as possible (1:2–1:3 weight/volume ratio), is taken 2 to 6 mL three times daily.52 There is no widely accepted standardization to ensure quality lemon balm extracts, although a minimum 0.05% volatile oil content is recommended by the German Commission E.40 Pure volatile oil of lemon balm may also be used at a dose of 1 to 3 drops taken internally three times daily in adults, or by topical application to the skin in a cream, lotion, or fixed oil base. Because of the expense of extracting the oil from this plant, however, there are many adulterated products on the market that contain lemon scent, lemongrass, or other lem- on-scented herbs and not lemon balm.


In a pharmacokinetic study, lemon balm containing 500 mg rosmarinic acid caused no adverse effects and did not affect liver, kidney, or blood cell function parameters.53 An ethanolic lemon balm extract was antig- enotoxic in mice, whereas the aqueous extract was not. Neither extract was genotoxic.54 However, in an Ames assay, a water extract of lemon balm was found to have a significant genotoxic and mutagenic effect, whereas the methanol and chloroform extracts lacked mutagenicity.55 Despite the theoretical concern that it might suppress thyroid function in euthyroid or hypothyroid patients, there are no published reports of this occurrence. Controlled trials in humans established that lemon balm, combined with extracts of V. officinalis (valerian) root, does not interfere with the ability to drive or operate heavy machin- ery.56 In one case study, a patient arrived at the emergency room (ER) with restlessness, tremor, distractibility, and sweating after discontin- uing lemon balm, raising the possibility that lemon balm may pres- ent a risk of dependency and can lead to withdrawal symptoms.57 In contrast, a review found that lemon balm dose-dependently reduced opioid withdrawal syndrome, with no mention of the herb itself caus- ing issues.58

There are no documented drug interactions for lemon balm. It does not interact with alcohol.55 Given its effects on thyroid function in vitro, there is a theoretical concern that the herb may have additive or synergistic effects with thyrosuppressive drugs and may interact in unpredictable ways with thyroid hormone replacement agents. Lemon balm should be combined with these classes of drugs only under care- ful supervision by an experienced health-care professional.

## Carminative Effects

Carminatives promote the elimination of intestinal gas. Peppermint and peppermint oil are well-accepted carminatives. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, one proposed mech- anism is relaxation of the esophageal sphincter, which leads to the release of gas pressure in the stomach.3

<!-- chunk -->

## Antispasmodic Effects

The mechanism behind peppermint oil’s antispasmodic effects was determined. Researchers concluded that peppermint oil inhibits con- tractions of isolated smooth muscles by blocking the influx of calcium into the muscle cells.4,5 Researchers hypothesized that the clinical effectiveness of peppermint oil in the treatment of irritable bowel syn- drome (IBS) is a result of inhibition of the hypercontractility of intes- tinal smooth muscle, thereby returning the muscle to its proper tone.

## Choleretic Effects

Choleretics stimulate the flow of bile. Menthol and related terpenes were shown to exert a choleretic effect and to improve the solubility of the bile.6–10

## External Analgesic Effects

The external analgesic and counterirritant effects of menthol are well accepted. When applied to the skin, peppermint oil or menthol stimu- lates the nerves that perceive cold and simultaneously depresses those for pain. The initial cooling effect is followed by a period of warmth.


Peppermint oil is the most extensively used of all the volatile oils. Pharmaceutic preparations often use peppermint oil or menthol for its therapeutic and flavoring properties. For example, it is used exten- sively in antacid products and irritant laxatives for both its flavor and its therapeutic effects. The same is true for its inclusion in mouthwash preparations and after-dinner mints. The pharmacological effects of peppermint and peppermint oil are useful in a number of clinical situations. The most notable are as follows: • IBS • Intestinal colic • Gallstones • Musculoskeletal pain • The common cold

<!-- chunk -->

## Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Enteric-coated peppermint oil (ECPO) was shown to be quite helpful in improving gastrointestinal (GI) function in individuals with IBS, a common functional disorder of the large intestine characterized by some combination of (1) abdominal pain; (2) altered bowel function, constipation, or diarrhea; (3) hypersecretion of colonic mucus; (4) dyspeptic symptoms (flatulence, nausea, anorexia); and (5) varying degrees of anxiety or depression. Several double-blind studies showed ECPO to be effective in reliev- ing all symptoms of IBS in approximately 70% to 85% of cases within 2 to 4 weeks.11–18 In one trial, 42 children between 8 and 10 years old with IBS were given ECPO or a placebo for 2 weeks. The dosage was one capsule three times daily for children weighing 30 to 45 kg and two capsules three times daily for children weighing more than 45 kg. After 2 weeks, 76% of the ECPO group reported significant improvements, compared with only 19% in the placebo group.15 In one double-blind study, 57 patients with IBS, with normal lac- tose and lactulose breath tests and negative antibody screening for celiac disease, were treated with peppermint oil (two enteric-coated capsules twice per day or placebo) for 4 weeks in a double-blind study. Results showed that 75% of the patients in the ECPO group showed a more than 50% reduction of basal total IBS symptoms score compared with 38% in the placebo group.16 In an 8-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study on 90 outpatients with IBS, the number of subjects free from abdomi- nal pain or discomfort changed from 0 at week 0 to 14 at week 8 in the ECPO group and from 0 to 6 in controls. The severity of abdominal pain was also reduced significantly in the ECPO group compared with controls.17 One of the central findings in IBS is a hypercontractility (excessive contraction) of intestinal smooth muscle. Peppermint oil, especially when combined with caraway oil, inhibits the hypercontractility of intestinal smooth muscle, making it useful in IBS and in esophageal spasm and intestinal colic.19 It may also affect gallbladder and small intestine function. A pharmacodynamic study of 90 mg peppermint oil and 50 mg caraway oil demonstrated that complete inhibition of gallbladder emptying was caused by both oils, and the transit time in the small intestine and the orocecal transit time were significantly pro- longed by peppermint oil.20 Although effective on its own, ECPO is best used within a compre- hensive treatment protocol for IBS (see Chapter 183).

## Nonulcer Dyspepsia

In addition to its effects in IBS, ECPO has benefits in nonulcer dyspep- sia (NUD), gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), and intestinal overgrowth of Candida albicans (a common yeast implicated in many cases of IBS) and Helicobacter pylori. NUD and GERD are basically catch-all terms that reflect a kind of wastebasket diagnosis that doctors use when they cannot find any real reason for a patient’s upper gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, just as IBS is used as a wastebasket diagnosis for lower GI dysfunction. Symptoms of NUD and GERD include heartburn, difficulty swallow- ing, feelings of pressure or heaviness after eating, sensations of bloating after eating, stomach or abdominal pains and cramps, and the symp- toms of IBS. About 3 of every 10 patients with NUD and GERD also meet the criteria for IBS. Several of the clinical studies in patients with IBS featured the com- bination of peppermint oil and caraway oil in an enteric-coated capsule (ECPCO). The results of these trials indicated that this combination produced better results than peppermint oil alone for symptoms of IBS. Later studies also indicated that the combination of pepper- mint and caraway oils was quite helpful in improving NUD.20–22 In one double-blind study, 120 patients with NUD were given either the ECPCO combination or cisapride (Propulsid) for 4 weeks.21 The mean reduction of pain score was comparable in the two groups (4.62 for ECPCO; 4.6 for cisapride). Other symptoms of NUD also improved in a similar fashion. Positive results were also found in H. pylori–positive individuals. Although the ECPCO combination is extremely safe at rec- ommended levels, cisapride caused fatal heart rhythm problems. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at least 111 peo- ple died as a result of cisapride use, and nearly 400 experienced heart abnormalities. Cisapride (Propulsid) was subsequently taken off the market.

## Cholelithiasis

Several studies showed that a formula containing menthol and related terpenes (menthone, pinene, borneol, cineol, and camphene) demon- strated efficacy in dissolving gallstones.6–10 This approach to gallstone removal offers an effective alternative to surgery and was shown to be

<!-- chunk -->

## 715CHAPTER 94 Mentha piperita (Peppermint)

safe even when the formula was consumed for prolonged periods (up to 4 years). Terpenes, like menthol, help dissolve gallstones by reduc- ing bile cholesterol levels while increasing bile acid and lecithin levels in the gallbladder. Because menthol was the major component of this formula, peppermint oil, especially if enteric-coated, may offer similar benefits.

<!-- chunk -->

## External Analgesic

Menthol and related substances can be used as counterirritants in the treatment of arthritis, fibromyositis, tendonitis, and other inflamma- tory conditions involving the musculoskeletal system.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Common Cold

Menthol and peppermint oils are often employed in the treatment of the common cold as components of topical nasal decongestants, cough and throat lozenges, ointments, salves, and inhalants. Whether the use of these products is of benefit has not been proven in clinical studies. However, their popularity appears to represent their ability to help make breathing easier during the common cold. The best method for using menthol or peppermint oil is to apply commercial prepara- tions to the upper chest during periods of rest so that the vapors can be inhaled continuously. Peppermint tea may also be of benefit during the common cold. Peppermint and other members of the mint family demonstrated significant antiviral activity in addition to a mild diaphoretic effect.23 The most active antiviral components, the polyphenols, are concen- trated in the tea.2 Peppermint oil also showed antiviral activity against Newcastle disease, herpes simplex, and vaccinia.

## Headache

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial, topical application of peppermint oil to the forehead and temples resulted in a statistically significant decrease in muscle tension as reported subjectively and measured objectively by electromyographic activity of the temporal muscle. In addition, the oil application decreased sensitivity to pain.24

## Endoscopy and Colonoscopy

A 20-mL oral solution containing 0.8% L-menthol suppresses peristal- sis in patients undergoing endscopy.25 Taking ECPO capsules before colonoscopy has also shown benefits. In a double-blind study, 65 adult patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomized to receive either ECPO or a placebo 4 hours before the procedure.26 Premedication with ECPO was beneficial in terms of the time required for cecal intubation and total procedure time, reducing colonic spasm, increasing endosco- pist satisfaction, and decreasing pain in patients during colonoscopy.


Peppermint is most widely used as a tea (infusion), on its own or in combination with other botanicals. The infusion is usually prepared with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the dried leaves per 8 oz of water. The dosage of peppermint oil administered in an enteric-coated capsule for the treatment of the IBS is one to two capsules (0.2 mL per capsule) three times daily between meals. This dosage is also appropri- ate for the treatment of gallstones. The dosage of menthol as an external analgesic is 1.26% to 16% applied to the affected area no more than three or four times daily.


Peppermint herb is generally regarded as safe when used as a tea; how- ever, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Adverse reactions to ECPO capsules are rare but include hypersensitivity reactions (rash), heartburn, bradycardia, and muscle tremor. When applied topically, peppermint oil or menthol can induce contact dermatitis and hypersensitivity reactions. The likelihood of the development of such a reaction is enhanced when heating pads are used in conjunction with topically applied preparations containing menthol.27 In rats, the lethal dose of menthol for 50% of subjects is 3280 mg/ kg. The fatal oral dose in humans is calculated at 1 g/kg. In one study, repeated high-dose feeding of rats for 28 days with peppermint oil pro- duced signs of dose-related brain lesions, but the dosage (40 mg/kg) given to the rats far exceeded that used in humans.1,28,29


Peppermint oil may enhance the oral bioavailability of certain drugs. Most notably, in a study in rats, peppermint oil (100 mg/kg) tripled the mean cyclosporine maximum concentration and increased the area under the concentration-versus-time curve.30 This dosage does not reflect the dosage used in clinical studies; however, physicians should be aware that peppermint oil may raise serum levels of certain drugs when the agents are coadministered.

## 717CHAPTER 95 Microbial Enzyme Therapy

according to some studies.10 Enteric-coated preparations are designed to protect pancreatic enzymes from gastric acidity; however, these do not work reliably in all cases.2,10,11 This is because most patients with pancreatic insufficiency are not able to concentrate bicarbon- ate sufficiently to alkalinize the upper small intestine. As a result, enteric-coated tablets or capsules often fail to dissolve and deliver their enzymes in the duodenum or jejunum as intended. The resulting jejunal hyperacidity can also inhibit pancreatic enzyme activity even if enteric coatings do dissolve as intended.2,7,10,12 Gastric hyperacidity can also lead to impaired fat digestion by causing acidic jejunal pH.12 Although H 2 receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, are often used along with pancreatin to lessen intragastric inactivation, this approach is unsuccessful in improving lipid digestion in many patients and car- ries the possible risk of adverse side effects.13 Studies show that certain acid-stable fungal enzyme preparations are naturally stable and enzymatically active in both acid and alkaline pH conditions. For example, lipase preparations derived from both A. oryzae and R. arrhizus were shown to be active and stable in the broad range of pH 2 to pH 10.7,8 As a result, such preparations do not require enteric coatings or coadministration of pH-altering drugs. They are effective even in patients with gastrointestinal pH imbalances, such as pancreatic insufficiency, jejunal hyperacidity, and gastric hyperacidity, which can limit the effectiveness of pancreatic enzymes. As a result of their broad pH range of activity, acid-stable fungal enzymes begin digesting food in the acid environment of the stomach and continue working in the alkaline pH of the small intestine.2,10,14 As discussed in this chapter, the following fungal enzymes have been shown to aid digestion in humans when administered orally at the time of food consumption: • Lipase • Protease • Amylase • Prolyl endopeptidase • Dipeptidyl peptidase IV • Lactase • Alpha-galactosidase • Phytase • Cellulase

## Pancreatic Insufficiency and Other Digestive Disorders

Studies have compared the efficacy of pancreatic enzymes and acid- stable fungal lipase in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insuffi- ciency in humans and animals. Some studies showed that acid-stable fungal lipase is effective at a substantially lower dose of enzyme activ- ity than that required for pancreatin to reduce pathologically elevated fecal fat levels, stool weight, and diarrhea.7,8 A controlled, crossover-design clinical trial in 17 patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency compared the effects of an acid-stable fungal enzyme preparation with conventional pancreatic enzymes and enteric-coated pancreatin. One group of nine patients with pancreato- duodenectomy and bowel resection (Whipple procedure) was found to have pancreatic enzyme levels less than 10% of normal on stim- ulated secretion before the trial. A second group of eight nonsurgi- cal patients had stimulated pancreatic enzyme levels less than 29% of normal. Both groups were placed on a diet containing 100 g/day of fat. Stools were collected for 72 hours before treatment beginning days after discontinuing all medications and supplemental enzymes. Thereafter all patients were placed on consecutive 2-week periods of treatment, beginning with enteric-coated pancreatin (100,000 International Pharmaceutical Federation [FIP] lipase units [LU]), followed by conventional pancreatin (360,000 FIP LU), and finally, acid-stable fungal lipase (75,000 FIP LU). The fungal enzyme prepa- ration and both of the pancreatic enzyme preparations also contained protease and amylase activity. Stools were collected for the last hours of each treatment period and analyzed for fecal fat content and stool weight. All three of the enzyme treatment protocols led to a sig- nificant reduction in fecal fat excretion in both groups (P < 0.05), and all patients became virtually symptom-free with regard to diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Of note, the enteric-coated pancreatin dosage was one-third higher and the conventional pancreatin dosage was nearly five times higher than that required for fungal lipase to produce comparable clinical improvement.8 A similar randomized, placebo-control, crossover-design study in dogs compared the effectiveness of 4000 LU of acid-stable fungal lipase derived from A. oryzae to 60,000 LU of lipase from pancre- atin in the treatment of surgically induced pancreatic insufficiency and steatorrhea. Dogs in the placebo group had significant weight loss as a result of malabsorption and pathologically elevated fecal fat content and stool weight. Compared with placebo, dogs in both enzyme treatment groups experienced significant reductions in fecal fat and stool weight, with no significant weight loss. In this study, the enzyme dose of pancreatin was 15 times higher than that required for the acid-stable fungal lipase to produce comparable clinical results.7 One controlled clinical trial showed that an acid-stable fungal lipase derived from Rhizopus arrhizus was effective at reducing steatorrhea by 56.5% and stool weight by 45.2% compared with placebo in seven patients with pancreatic insufficiency. The study also demonstrated that the fungal lipase retained greater than 80% of its enzyme activity under conditions of simulated gastric acidity at pH 3 for 1 hour.15 Another study in 100 outpatients evaluated the efficacy of a fun- gal enzyme preparation containing lipase derived from R. arrhizus and protease and amylase from A. oryzae in a range of gastrointestinal complaints, including epigastric pain and pressure, flatulence, heart- burn, belching, and nausea. Investigators reported that 96% of patients experienced some relief of symptoms and rated treatment outcomes as good to very good in 65% of patients.16 Some clinical trials reported on the efficacy of enzyme preparations containing protease, amylase, cellulase, and hemicellulase derived from A. oryzae in combination with pancreatic enzymes in the treat- ment of a range of digestive disorders.17,18 One double-blind, placebo- controlled, crossover design study in a group of 31 outpatients (ages 17–75 years) and 23 geriatric hospital inpatients (ages 70–90 years) found that this enzyme combination was significantly effective in the global improvement of diverse gastrointestinal symptoms (P < 0.05) that included pain, nausea, heartburn, bloating, flatulence, constipa- tion, and diarrhea.17

## Gluten-Related Disorders

Adverse reactions to gluten in the diet can lead to a broad range of gastrointestinal and systemic conditions caused by several different pathophysiological mechanisms that have been referred to collectively as “gluten-related disorders.”19–21 Among the most widely recognized, celiac disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction to dietary gluten. It affects about 1% of the Western population.22 Other less well-known forms of gluten-induced autoimmune disease include dermatitis her- petiformis and gluten ataxia. Nonautoimmune allergic reactions to gluten can also occur as in the case of wheat allergy.19,20 Other forms of gluten intolerance include nonceliac gluten sensitivity, which can produce a variety of gastroenterological21 and neurological symp- toms.19,23,24 The actual prevalence of all forms of gluten-related disor- ders combined is not known with certainty. However, data from one

review study indicate that adverse reactions to gluten in the diet may affect about 10% of the population.19 Gluten is a type of protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It con- sists of two main fractions: gliadins and glutenins. Adverse reactions to gluten appear primarily as a result of unusually high amounts of the amino acid proline that it contains, comprising as much as 20% of the molecule.25 The proline-rich peptide bonds in gluten make it resis- tant to digestion by proteolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 95.1). As a result, the intestinal mucosa is exposed to undigested gluten-derived polypeptides. A number of these peptides have been shown to cause pathological reactions in sensitive individuals.22,25,26 The most effective way to manage gluten-related disorders is for affected individuals to maintain a strict gluten-free diet. However, that can often be hard to accomplish. In addition to the difficulty of compliance and potential social challenges of avoiding foods known to contain gluten, exposure to hidden sources of gluten in the diet is a common problem. One study estimated that unsuspected sources of gluten contained in many prepared foods such as sauces, salad dress- ings, flavorings, thickeners, etc., may result in daily exposure to 10 to 1000 mg of hidden gluten—even among individuals trying to maintain a gluten-free diet.27 This has led to a search for therapeutic interven- tions to ease the burdens of a gluten-free diet and the consequences of accidental exposure to hidden gluten. Beginning as early as the 1950s, studies have examined the efficacy of various proteolytic enzymes derived from fungal and bacterial sources capable of hydrolyzing and thereby degrading the gluten molecule with the goal of reducing its toxicity to sensitive individuals. Some of these have shown great prom- ise in mitigating the challenges of gluten-related disorders by reducing the risk of exposure to hidden gluten. This section reviews evidence of efficacy for some of these enzymes, alone and in combination.

## Prolyl Endopeptidase

Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition triggered by reactions that occur in the small intestine to immunogenic gluten-derived peptide fragments, or epitopes, in genetically susceptible individuals. Signs and symptoms can be severe and include abdominal pain and disten- sion, chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, anemia, fatigue, and increased risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancers.22 Some of these immunogenic peptides are described by the number of amino acids in the peptide chain followed by the suffix “-mer.” For example, a 33-mer from α -gliadin and a 26-mer from γ -gliadin are known to trigger proinflammatory T-cell reactions leading to mucosal damage. Antibodies to immunogenic gluten-derived peptides that are produced by activated T-cells and B-cells cross-react with host tissues leading to inflammation, mucosal atrophy, loss of digestive function, nutrient malabsorption, and other GI and systemic disorders.22,28 Recent studies have shown that a specific type of protease derived from Aspergillus niger is capable of hydrolyzing proline bonds within these immune-reactive gluten epitopes. This enzyme is known as Aspergillus niger-derived prolyl endopeptidase or prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP). It is a proline-specific endopeptidase that primarily cleaves the hard-to-digest proline peptide bonds in the interior portions of gluten peptides. A 2006 study measured the effectiveness of AN-PEP at detoxifying immunogenic gluten epitopes in vitro. After intact gluten and gluten predigested with pepsin and trypsin were treated with AN-PEP they no longer triggered reactions in gluten-sensitive T-cells. Destruction of all 14 of the tested immune-reactive gluten peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, high-per- formance liquid chromatography, and Western blot testing. AN-PEP was found to be active and stable from pH 2 to 8 with optimal activity at pH 4 to 5.29 An in vitro study in 2008 measured the effectiveness of AN-PEP at breaking down immunogenic gluten peptides from a slice of bread and, in a second experiment, from a gluten-containing “fast food” test meal. Samples of digested food were taken from the stomach and intes- tinal compartments of a simulated gastrointestinal model (TIM sys- tem). These were analyzed for the presence of immunogenic peptides from gliadins and glutenins using T-cell proliferation assays, monoclo- nal antibody-based assays, and Western blot testing. AN-PEP degraded almost all the immune-active gluten peptides in the stomach before they could reach the duodenum.30 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 2015 measured the ability of AN-PEP to digest gluten in the stomach of 12 healthy volunteers. Each subject was given a liquid low- or high- calorie meal containing 4 g of gluten with either AN-PEP or placebo administered to the stomach via catheter. Gastric and duodenal sam- ples were aspirated over a period of 4 hours and analyzed for content of an immunodominant α -gliadin epitope using enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. Compared with placebo, AN-PEP significantly lowered α -gliadin concentrations in the stomach and duodenum (P < 0.001) and lowered α -gliadin in the duodenum from low (P < 0.001) and high (P = 0.013) calorie meals. Almost all the gluten was degraded in the stomach within a 1-hour period from both low and high calorie meals. A dosage of 1,600,000 Protease Picomole International (PPI) units of AN-PEP significantly enhanced digestion 4 g of dietary gluten in the stomach before entering the duodenum in this study.21

## Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV

Unlike proteases from the stomach and pancreas that are unable to hydrolyze proline-peptide bonds, the brush border membrane of the intestinal mucosa produces a protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which can degrade some of the proline-rich immunogenic peptides in gluten.28,31 Clinical studies have shown that DPP-IV lev- els are substantially depressed in celiac patients. Other brush border digestive enzymes are also depressed in celiac patients during peri- ods of active disease (e.g., lactase, sucrase, maltase). However, other brush border enzymes return to normal levels in celiac patients who are in remission and DPP-IV remains consistently depressed in these patients.28,32 In contrast to AN-PEP, which cleaves proline-peptide bonds mainly in the interior of gluten-derived peptides, DPP-IV is a proline-specific exopeptidase capable of cleaving proline-containing dipeptides at the N-terminal end of gluten peptides.28 In vitro studies have shown that porcine-derived DPP-IV is able to break down immunodominant epi- topes from gliadin.28,32 DPP-IV derived from Aspergillus oryzae has also been shown to enhance the breakdown of immunogenic gluten epitopes in vitro.27 Some research has suggested that gluten may also cause neuro- logical symptoms in susceptible individuals. A 2006 literature review found several studies showing a drastic or complete remission of schizophrenic symptoms after withdrawal of gluten from the diet in a subset of patients.33 In addition to larger gluten-derived immuno- genic peptides such as 33-mer and 26-mer that can cause autoim- mune reactions found in celiac disease, other smaller gluten-derived peptides may cause neurological symptoms not mediated by immune O OH N H

mechanisms. A 1992 study isolated four different peptides from wheat gluten with chain lengths of 4 to 5 amino acids that were highly specific for delta opioid receptors found in the brain. These were termed gluten exorphins, or glumorphins. One of these peptide sequences, known as glumorphin A5, was found at 15 locations in wheat glutenin.23 It has been hypothesized that opioid peptides derived from gluten and casein may also play a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), although this has not been conclusively proven. Children with autism have significantly higher serum levels of IgG antibody to gliadin com- pared with healthy controls, particularly in those with gastrointestinal symptoms.34 A two-stage, randomized, controlled study of children with ASD on a gluten-free and casein-free diet reported significant group improvements in core autistic and related behaviors after 8 and 12 months on the diet.35 A study in 2012 found that glumorphin A5 was present in the urine of children with autism but not in normal control subjects.24 Glumorphin A5 contains an N-terminal proline dipeptide like other gluten derived peptides that can be degraded by DPP-IV; however, this has not been confirmed in controlled clinical studies.

## Efficacy of Enzyme Combinations

In addition to the individual activities of AN-PEP and DPP-IV, there is evidence that some combinations of proline-specific fungal peptidases are more effective at detoxifying dietary gluten than single enzymes alone. As an exopeptidase, DPP-IV has been shown to hydrolyze pro- line dipeptide bonds at the N-terminal ends of immunogenic gluten epitopes. As an endopeptidase, AN-PEP has primarily been shown to hydrolyze proline-peptide bonds in the interior of gluten peptides. AN-PEP has also been shown to have exopeptidase activity capable of hydrolyzing some proline-peptide bonds at the ends of these peptides; however, it does not cleave all such bonds.29 One study showed that a proline-specific bacterial oligopepti- dase used in combination with AN-PEP was able to hydrolyze the N-terminal proline-dipeptide bonds that were resistant to digestion by AN-PEP alone.29 Another study showed that the combination of DPP-IV derived from Aspergillus oryzae with an Aspergillus niger-de- rived protease was more effective than either enzyme alone in detox- ifying gluten. The exopeptidase activity of DPP-IV accelerated the clearance of short peptides, thereby facilitating access of longer gluten fragments to the active site of the other enzyme. The combination of enzymes resulted in significantly enhanced degradation of immuno- genic gluten epitopes.27 These in vitro studies indicate that oral sup- plementation with a combination of proline-specific fungal peptidases may provide synergistic benefits by hydrolyzing different portions of the molecule, resulting in more complete and efficient gluten degrada- tion. Future studies may help determine which combinations of such enzymes may offer greater efficacy for detoxifying dietary gluten in sensitive individuals.

## Lactose Intolerance

Deficient secretion of intestinal lactase ( β -galactosidase) can produce signs and symptoms of dietary lactose intolerance, including abdom- inal pain, diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and an increase in breath hydrogen excretion. Studies indicate that lactase deficiency occurs in more than half of the adult human population.36 Some degree of lac- tose maldigestion is also a common problem in children, occurring in 76% of apparently healthy children in one study and 56% in another controlled trial.37 Maldigestion of lactose can result from genetic non- persistence of intestinal lactase some time after weaning as well as from acquired lactase deficiencies. Deficient lactase production may or may not produce clinical symptoms of lactose intolerance.3 A study of children with intestinal biopsies found that lactase activity decreased significantly with age and correlated with degree of intestinal injury. Other studies also showed that intestinal secretion of lactase, sucrase, and maltase were decreased in conditions with intestinal mucosal injury and morphological changes, including those seen in celiac dis- ease and chronic diarrhea.38–41 A number of controlled human studies showed that fungal lac- tase administered orally at the time of milk consumption or added to milk at mealtime was each effective at preventing or treating signs and symptoms of intolerance in lactose-intolerant individuals.3,37,42 One double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that oral supplemen- tation with fungal lactase taken at the time of lactose consumption was significantly effective at reducing breath hydrogen excretion and treating clinical symptoms in 18 children with lactose intolerance (ages 8–14 years). Test subjects were given tablets containing β -galactosidase derived from A. oryzae coingested with a lactose solution (3000 Food Chemicals Codex [FCC] lactase units [ALU]/5 g lactose) after a mini- mum fast of 8 hours. Breath hydrogen was measured every 30 minutes and clinical symptoms were monitored for the 120-minute test period. Lactase treatment successfully lowered breath hydrogen to below lac- tose malabsorption threshold levels in 89% of patients (P < 0.001). In the placebo group, 89% experienced abdominal pain, 83% bloating, 61% diarrhea, and 44% experienced flatulence. In the lactase group, only 6% experienced abdominal pain, 6% had diarrhea, and none of the test subjects experienced bloating or flatulence.3

## Oligosaccharide Intolerance

Oligosaccharides contained in legumes and other vegetables can produce symptoms such as flatulence, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea in many individuals. These carbohydrates are resistant to digestion by gastrointestinal enzymes and are therefore available for uptake and fermentation by colonic microflora resulting in the production of gases such as hydrogen. Studies have shown that oral administration of alpha-galactosidase enzyme derived from Aspergillus niger is safe and effective at breaking down these dietary oligosaccha- rides and preventing or reducing flatulence and related abdominal symptoms in sensitive individuals. A double-blind crossover trial compared the effects of alpha-galac- tosidase and placebo administered with a test meal of vegetarian chili in 19 subjects. They were asked to keep a careful record of gastrointestinal symptoms for 6 hours after the meal, including the passing of intestinal gas. The number of flatulence events was significantly reduced during the follow-up period in those taking alpha-galactosidase versus pla- cebo (P = 0.016).43 A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 2007 measured the effect of alpha-galactosidase on intestinal gas production and symp- toms of abdominal pain, discomfort, flatulence, and diarrhea in healthy volunteers. Doses of 300 GalU or 1200 GalU of alpha-galacto- sidase or placebo were administered with a test meal containing 420 g of cooked beans and breath hydrogen and gastrointestinal symptoms were monitored for 8 hours. Compared with placebo, both doses of alpha-galactosidase decreased breath hydrogen excretion and signifi- cantly reduced total symptom scores.44

# IMPROVING NUTRIENT BIOAVAILABILITY

Dietary supplementation with fungal enzymes has been shown to improve nutrient bioavailability in humans and animals. The effect of supplementation with lipase, amylase, protease, cellulase, and lac- tase from Aspergillus niger in combination with bromelain was studied in 16 clinically stable nursing-home patients receiving enteral nutri- tion by intubation before and after three consecutive 15-day feeding

periods. Supplementation with the enzyme mixture improved nutri- tional status as measured by significantly improved blood protein levels compared with the nonsupplemented diet (P = 0.02). Albumin concentration and lymphocyte count also tended to improve with enzyme administration.45 Bioavailability of minerals can be considerably reduced by dietary phytate. Humans and monogastric animals produce little or no endog- enous phytase in the gastrointestinal tract.46 A controlled clinical trial in humans showed that dietary supplementation with an acid-stable fungal phytase from A. niger increased absorption of iron from the diet. The study also showed that the fungal phytase was stable and active across a broad range from pH 1.0 to 7.5, and that it initiated digestion of dietary phytate beginning in the stomach.14 Animal studies showed that supplementation with fungal phytase helped improve zinc, cal- cium, and phosphorus bioavailability, and increased bone strength in a dose-dependent manner.47,48 Studies showed that supplementation with fungal cellulase helped increase nutritional value of dietary grains in animals. Cellulase sig- nificantly improved digestibility of dietary cell wall components and increased solubility of calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, and copper associated with cell walls.49 Studies using multienzyme combinations, including fungal amylase, protease, invertase, phytase, and cellulase, showed increased digestibility of nutrients and improved growth in pigs and chickens.50,51

# VASCULAR DISEASE

A number of placebo-controlled clinical studies confirmed the effec- tiveness of a proteolytic fungal enzyme in the treatment of chronic arterial obstruction in humans.52–55 A single-blind, placebo-con- trolled, crossover study evaluated the effectiveness of protease from A. oryzae versus placebo in 18 patients (ages 63–75 years) with stable intermittent claudication.52 Patients were divided into an experimental group and a placebo group of nine subjects each, and all patients were assessed before testing. Translumbar aortogram, Doppler ultrasound, and peripheral systolic blood pressure were used to assess the patency of eight different arterial segments in each patient (a total of 72 arte- rial segments in each group). Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin was introduced after assessment and continued throughout an observation period of 3 months and a subsequent trial period of 2 weeks. Patients were reassessed after the 3-month observation period. Thereafter a series of six intravenous infusions of fungal protease or normal saline placebo was given to experimental and control groups, respectively, over the 2-week trial period. Assessment of peripheral circulation was repeated at the end of the trial period. No other form of therapy was given, except warfarin for anticoagulation. Before treatment, patients in the experimental group were found to have 27 obstructed segments (completely obstructed), 34 stenosed segments (partially obstructed), and only 11 patent arterial segments. Patients in the placebo group had 25 obstructed, 26 stenosed, and 21 patent arterial segments before treatment. At the end of the 3-month observation period, no changes in Doppler ultrasound findings or peripheral blood pressure were found in either group. At the end of the 2-week trial period, three of the stenosed arterial segments in the placebo group had progressed to complete obstruction, and none of the obstructed segments had become patent (i.e., 4% worse). In the protease group, 16 of the 17 arterial segments that were completely obstructed became pat- ent and one improved to stenosed status during the 2-week treat- ment period. Overall, treatment with the fungal protease infusion improved patency of 33 of 72 arterial segments, a 46% improvement (P < 0.001). Further analysis of results from this study suggested that an increase in the number and/or dosage of protease infusions might have resulted in even greater improvement in obstructed and stenosed arterial segments. Other studies showed intravenous administration of fungal protease to be effective in the treatment of arterial obstruction in patients with more advanced conditions, such as gangrene and other severe ischemic disease.53,55

# PHARMACOLOGY OF FUNGAL PROTEASES

Fungal proteases have been used for many years in food production and medical applications. The most common fungal proteases used in medical and dietary supplement applications are derived from Aspergillus oryzae and A. niger. A. oryzae–derived protease preparations are used orally for the prevention and treatment of digestive disorders and are treated as drugs for this purpose in some countries.17,18,56 A. oryzae produces three main proteases that are naturally acid-re- sistant and that exhibit aggregate proteolytic enzyme activity over a broad range from pH 3 to 9.56,57 One of these three proteases, some- times referred to in the literature as A. oryzae protease I, was used for treatment of vascular disease in the previously cited clinical trials.52,53 Studies showed that the thrombolytic effects it exhibited were caused by its fibrinolytic activity.58,59 It also has hydrolytic enzyme activity against fibrinogen. It does not affect the plasminogen–plasmin system nor does it interfere with normal blood clotting in therapeutic doses.60 A. oryzae protease I has a molecular weight of about 35 kDa.59 It is carried in the blood bound to protease inhibitor proteins α2 -macro- globulin and α1 -antitrypsin.52,59 These are the same plasma proteins that act as carriers for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and bromelain.61–63 These protease inhibitors help maintain a protective balance by modu- lating proteolytic activity in the blood while also maintaining the pro- teases they carry in an enzymatically active form. As mentioned previously, acid-stable fungal protease has been used and studied clinically to aid digestion of dietary protein in the gastro- intestinal tract on oral administration at mealtime.17,18,56 Anecdotal reports suggested that some clinicians also administer fungal prote- ase supplements orally between meals as an adjunct in the nutritional treatment of inflammatory conditions and food allergies. A possible mechanism of action for these applications is supported by indirect evidence that some portion of orally administered fungal enzymes is probably absorbed intact and retains enzymatic activity in the blood.

## Absorption of Orally Administered Enzymes

Contrary to long-held theories that the healthy intestinal mucosa is an essentially impermeable barrier to intact proteins, including enzymes, there is compelling evidence that such macromolecules can and do pass intact from the human gut into the bloodstream under both nor- mal and pathological conditions.1,64–67 Numerous whole proteins, including animal and plant-derived enzymes, were shown in human and animal studies to be absorbed intact into the bloodstream after oral administration. Several human studies showed that exogenous pancreatic trypsin (molecular weight approximately 23 kDa) and chymotrypsin (25 kDa) were absorbed intact in an enzymatically active form after oral administration.68–70 Studies showed that an enteropancreatic circulation normally exists, in which pancreatic enzymes are absorbed from the gut intact and while enzymatically active, travel in the circulation, are reabsorbed by the pancreas, and resecreted back into the gut mixed with newly synthe- sized enzymes.71,72 Other examples of enzymes and other proteins that are absorbed intact on enteral administration include amylase (54 kDa), elas- tase, chymotrypsinogen, human albumin and lactalbumin, bovine

albumin, ovalbumin, lactoglobulin, and other large molecules, such as ferritin (500 kDa) and botulism toxin (1000 kDa).64–67,70,73–75 Studies also demonstrated the intact absorption of orally administered plant enzymes, such as bromelain (24 kDa), papain (39 kDa), and peroxi- dase from horseradish (40 kDa).61,70,76 Some studies examined the quantitative significance of the absorp- tion of orally administered enzymes. A randomized, double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled trial measured the absorption of orally administered bromelain in 19 healthy men (ages 18–45 years). Enteric-coated bro- melain was given to the test group in six daily doses, averaging 660 mg each over a 2-day period. Bromelain was found to be absorbed intact in an enzymatically active form and in time-dependent concentrations in the blood of all subjects in the test group. Individuals in the placebo group had no detectable bromelain levels. Total bromelain measured in the blood of test subjects over a 4-day monitoring period was equiv- alent to approximately 0.7% of the administered oral dose.61 Studies in animals looked at the percentage of total administered doses of pancreatic enzymes and papain that were absorbed intact after enteral administration. One study in rats found that approximately 27% of the total administered dose of trypsin, 14% of chymotryp- sin, 8% of amylase, and 6% of the administered dose of papain were absorbed into the bloodstream as intact macromolecules in an enzy- matically active form after enteral administration.70 Based on indirect evidence in humans and animals such as this, it appears likely that some portion of A. oryzae–derived protease and other fungal enzymes is absorbed intact after oral administration between meals. To the extent that such absorption does occur, orally administered fungal proteases may exhibit therapeutic properties in the systemic circulation and tissues. These properties include fibrino- lytic activity that may be of potential benefit in the treatment of inflam- matory conditions in various tissues throughout the body. They also include the ability to hydrolyze dietary proteins and polypeptides that may be of potential benefit in the treatment of food allergies.

# FOOD ALLERGIES

Under healthy conditions, adequate protein digestion, normal intesti- nal permeability, and healthy immune function are important physio- logical mechanisms that act together to limit the amount of undegraded dietary proteins and polypeptides that is absorbed into the general circulation. Under pathological conditions, these food-derived mac- romolecules can act as antigens and contribute to food allergies.1,67,77 Fungal protease administered orally at mealtime helps hydrolyze dietary protein in the gut17,18,56 and may therefore help reduce the sup- ply of foreign macromolecules available to leak into the bloodstream. In addition, it is possible that fungal protease administered orally between meals may be partially absorbed in an enzymatically active form and help to some extent “digest” dietary protein-derived antigens in the blood. This could potentially reduce the quantity of circulating antigens and be of benefit in the treatment of food allergies or perhaps even food-linked autoimmune disorders. Further research is needed to evaluate these proposed mechanisms of action and confirm whether fungal enzyme supplementation may be a useful adjunct in the treat- ment of food allergies.


Research has shown that certain enzymes derived from fungal species such as A. oryzae, A. niger, and Rhizopus spp. are safe and effective at increasing digestion and treating certain digestive disorders when administered orally at mealtime. These enzymes are inherently stable on exposure to stomach acid and exhibit digestive enzyme activity on a wide variety of dietary substrates over a broad pH range. Because of these properties, fungal enzymes may offer clinical advantages over pancreatic enzymes and pH-altering drugs in some conditions such as pancreatic insufficiency. Indirect evidence suggests that fungal enzymes may be partially absorbed in an intact and enzymatically active form when adminis- tered orally between meals. To the extent that such absorption does occur, it is possible that orally administered A. oryzae protease may have potential benefit as an anti-inflammatory agent as a result of its known fibrinolytic activity; however, any efficacy in this application remains unproven. Further research is also needed to confirm a pos- sible benefit for the use of fungal enzymes in the treatment of food allergies.

## 723CHAPTER 96 Natural Medicines Quality Control

companies historically have performed little or no testing on their raw materials (RM) or their finished DSs. They accept a certificate of anal- ysis (COA) from their supplier. The COA is just a piece of paper that says the material is what it is supposed to be. When a DS manufacturer blindly accepts a COA as the “sole” proof of authenticity, potency, and purity, they relinquish their verification role. Why do they do this? Because it is quick, easy, cheap, and saves money, hassle, delay, and personnel. In short, they take the easy way out. This practice is likely to continue until practitioners and consumers knowledgeably demand quality or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clamps down and puts noncompliant manufacturers out of business or makes them comply under the threat of constant scrutiny, steep fines, or shutting down their business. The chain of events needed to produce high-quality DSs is too long and complicated to “trust” it will happen with consistent integrity without comprehensive testing of raw mate- rials and finished products (FPs). Pharmaceutical drugs are all too frequently sold as DSs. Unscrupulous DS manufacturers or marketing companies will sell products for weight loss, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, athletic perfor- mance, etc. These products are advertised as DSs, but the active ingre- dient is a pharmaceutical drug. In addition, drug and disease claims are often used in the marketing of DSs. These two practices give the DS industry a bad name, tarnishing the legitimate manufacturers and leading the FDA to mistrust companies that produce DSs.

# THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

The FDA has had regulatory oversight of the DS industry for 15 years or longer. In 2007 they put into place Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) regulations. The regulations are basically rules to follow when manufacturing DSs, much like a strict recipe that has to be followed to get the intended outcome. They are “the law,” and every manufacturer has to follow them. For about a decade the FDA has been conducting inspections of DS companies to see if they are complying with regulations. Word on the street is that many manufacturers are not complying. Maybe they will at some point in the future, but how will you know if a particular company is, or is not, complying with DS CGMPs? Points regarding the FDA: • The FDA’s mission is to promote and protect the public health by helping safe and effective products reach the market in a timely way, and monitoring products for continued safety after they are in use. • The FDA is probably underfunded and overburdened. At present, they probably do not have the capacity to strictly oversee the DS industry and enforce wide compliance in a short period of time. • The DS CGMP regulations were written loosely so as to be flexible. This is a serious problem because it allows each manufacturer to apply “their own” interpretation of what it will take to comply with the regulations, possibly resulting in poor-quality DSs in the mar- ketplace. • Because the regulations were written to be flexible, the FDA gives little to no guidance on the detailed specifics of “Expected Best Practices” to DS manufacturers. The lack of FDA specific guidance parameters keeps everybody guessing as to whether or not the way “they” interpret the regulations will be acceptable to the FDA. • The FDA will strictly enforce the DS CGMPs. As they do, it is likely to bring significant positive change to the DS industry that will ulti- mately benefit the consumer. If a DS manufacturer says that they are in compliance with FDA CGMPs, it does not mean they have done enough to adequately test and verify their raw materials and FPs and to ensure that the final product is authentic, potent, and has maximum freedom from con- tamination. In addition, it is important to know that the FDA has mandated by law that if a product has an expiration date or best used by date on the label, the DS manufacturer has to have data to support the expiration date time period. What data do DS manufacturers have to show? The FDA is silent on this point. The FDA CGMPs do not give any guidance to the indus- try as to what is acceptable to meet this requirement. This is a perfect example of the FDA providing no guidance on an important part of the DS CGMPs and leaving it to the DS manufacturer to guess and interpret what may be adequate.

## Manufacturing Practices

Companies that supply DS ingredients (domestic or foreign) to DS manufacturers do not have to follow the FDA DS CGMPs. According to the FDA, this means that the responsibility for the quality of raw mate- rial ingredients falls on the FP DS manufacturer and not on the supplier of the materials. This is unfortunate and a major deficiency in the DS CGMPs. Why? Because companies that supply ingredients to DS man- ufacturers can produce and sell poor-quality or tainted ingredients and are not held accountable. If the supplier of the ingredients and the man- ufacturer that uses the ingredients had to follow the same regulations, there would be a synergy to bring quality ingredients to the marketplace. The following information comes from the FDA’s website (www.fda.gov), and it gives enough detail to see what DS manufac- turers must do to comply with these legally required regulations. The FDA DS CGMPs are not voluntary but must be followed because they are the law. All DS manufacturers are required to follow these rules as of June 2010.

## CGMP Final Rule

• The current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) final rule will require that proper controls are in place for dietary supplements so that they are processed in a consistent manner, and meet quality standards. • The CGMPs apply to all domestic and foreign companies that manufacture, package, label, or hold dietary supplements, includ- ing those involved with the activities of testing, quality control, packaging and labeling, and distributing them in the United States. • The rule establishes CGMPs for industry-wide use that are neces- sary to require that dietary supplements are manufactured consis- tently as to identity, purity, strength, and composition. • The requirements include provisions related to: • The design and construction of physical plants that facilitate maintenance • Cleaning • Proper manufacturing operations • Quality control procedures • Testing final product or incoming and in-process materials • Handling consumer complaints, and • Maintaining records

<!-- chunk -->

## Consumer Benefits

• Consumers should have access to dietary supplements that meet quality standards and that are free from contamination and are accurately labeled. • The rule will give consumers greater confidence that the dietary supplement they use has been manufactured to ensure its identity, purity, strength, and composition.

<!-- chunk -->

## 724SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

• The rule addresses the quality of manufacturing processes for dietary supplements and the accurate listing of supplement ingre- dients. It does not limit consumers’ access to dietary supplements, or address the safety of their ingredients, or their effects on health when proper manufacturing techniques are used.

<!-- chunk -->

## Manufacturers

• Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), manufacturers have an essential responsibility to sub- stantiate the safety of their products and for determining that any representations or claims made about their products are substan- tiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or mis- leading. • The CGMPs will help ensure manufacturers produce unadulterated and properly labeled dietary supplements. • Under the CGMP rule, manufacturers are required to: • Employ qualified employees and supervisors. • Design and construct their physical plant in a manner to pro- tect dietary ingredients and dietary supplements from becom- ing adulterated during manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding. • Use equipment and utensils that are of appropriate design, con- struction, and workmanship for the intended use. • Establish and use master manufacturing and batch production records. • Establish procedures for quality control operations. • Hold and distribute dietary supplements and materials used to manufacture dietary supplements under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, light, and sanitation so that the qual- ity of the dietary supplement is not affected. • Keep a written record of each product complaint related to CGMPs. • Retain records for 1 year past the shelf life date, if shelf life dating is used, or 2 years beyond the date of distribution of the last batch of dietary supplements associated with those records. • Examples of product quality problems that the rule will help pre- vent are: • Dietary supplements that contain ingredients in amounts that are greater than those listed on the label • Dietary supplements that contain ingredients in amounts that are less than those listed on the label • Wrong ingredient • Other contaminant (e.g., bacteria, pesticide, glass, lead) • Foreign material in a dietary supplement container • Improper packaging • Mislabeling The regulations mandate that each DS manufacturer set, docu- ment, and meet quality specifications for raw material ingredients and FPs. Each manufacturer gets to set its own specifications based on what it feels and/or thinks is important and complies with the regulation to ensure the four buzz words: identity, purity, strength, and compo- sition. Herein lies a major problem with the CGMPs. The FDA gives little if any guidance on setting specifications. “Purity” is one of the buzz words; one aspect of purity is con- tamination. Part 111.70 of the regulation states, “You must estab- lish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supple- ment to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement.” No guidance is given as to the types of contamination to consider. In CGMP seminars conducted around the country in the past few years, the FDA mentioned some examples of contamination and ultimately stated that the DS manufacturer should know globally what con- taminants to consider. Here is an example to illustrate: • DS manufacturer “A” sets a specification for testing for a wide panel of chemical solvent residues in each batch of received RMs, examines those results for acceptable limits, and approves or rejects materials based on those limits. • DS manufacturer “B” sets a specification for testing for chemi- cal solvent residue only if they are listed on the suppliers’ COA, examines those results for acceptable limits, and approves or rejects materials based on those limits. • DS manufacturer “C” sets a specification that does not include chemical solvent residue testing. Each DS manufacturer set a specification per the CGMPs, but each was different. Are they all acceptable to the FDA? We do not know. Which manufacturer’s products would you prefer to prescribe?

# THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY CONTROL

The first reason quality control is very important is clinical effec- tiveness. In other words, will it have the intended physiological effect on the body? Great quality does not always ensure significant clinical response, but most would agree that a low potency product or one that was not even what it claimed to be is not likely to help patients. The second reason quality control is very important is that some sort of contamination may be present in the product. Long-term use of contaminated DSs may possibly cause harm. Depending on whether it is botanical or nonbotanical, the contaminants present could be lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, an array of chemical solvents, aflatoxins (liver toxins from mold growth), herbicides and pesticides, harmful bacteria, and industrial chemicals. Unfortunately, with RMs coming from all over the world, contam- ination is a risk that is unavoidable.

## Food and Drug Administration Definition of Quality

The FDA DS CGMP regulation has specific definitions for quality and quality control. • Quality means that the dietary supplement consistently meets the established specifications for identity, purity, strength, compo- sition, and limits on contaminants, and has been manufactured, packaged, labeled, and held under conditions to prevent adultera- tion under section 402(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of the act. • Quality control means a planned and systematic operation or pro- cedure for ensuring the quality of a dietary supplement. The only test specifically mandated by the FDA that must be per- formed is identity testing. The need for further testing is open to inter- pretation by the DS manufacturer.

## A More Specific and Robust Definition of Quality

A DS is a quality product or not based on three parameters.

<!-- chunk -->

## Is It Real?

In other words, is the RM authentic (i.e., has it been properly identified via a test method that is widely accepted as scientifically valid)? If no testing was performed to verify or identify the RM, and it was used in an FP anyway, its inclusion in the product not only could have resulted in decreased response; it may have actively caused harm. Identifying and authenticating botanical products can be chal- lenging especially if they are powdered extracts versus plant parts or powdered plant parts that have not been extracted. Plant parts (leaves, roots, stems) when whole or in pieces can be identified more easily by

## 725CHAPTER 96 Natural Medicines Quality Control

gross and microscopic examinations to ensure compliance with pub- lished criteria that are specific to the plant. Most powdered botanical extracts need to undergo some sort of chemical or technical testing to verify correct genus and species. Vitamins, amino acids, and many other nonbotanical materials are somewhat easier to chemically identify than botanicals, and botanicals are much more prone to adulteration. Mineral forms can also present a serious challenge to truly authen- ticate. For example, magnesium glycinate is thought to have some absorption advantage over magnesium oxide and other magnesium forms. Magnesium glycinate is supposed to be magnesium chemically bonded in a particular way to glycine. This is a true chelate (i.e., one molecule). Some mineral RM suppliers skip the bonding part either in part or completely and just mix magnesium carbonate or magnesium oxide with glycine and call it magnesium glycinate. In essence, it is a dry blend of two compounds with only partial or no bonding.

## Is It the Potency It Claims to Be?

In most cases (there are some exceptions for skip lot testing if an RM supplier is properly qualified; see “Supplier Certification and Skip Lot Testing”) testing every lot of material received for potency helps ensure a consistently potent FP. If most lots are solely identified as authentic and not tested for potency, this does not document the potency of the FP. Much of the potency issue has to do with label claims as well. Some examples: Scenario 1: If a licorice extract product has a label stating licorice extract 12% 200 mg (i.e., the licorice extract contains 12% glycyr- rhizin), one would have to verify the potency (by testing) of the RM going into the FP and would also have to verify by testing that there was 12% glycyrrhizin in the FP. If a label has a potency claim, the DS manufacturer has to prove that the claim was met and the FP contained 100% of the labeled potency claim. Always meeting 100% of a potency claim is stipulated by current DS labeling law. Scenario 2: Another option could be a licorice extract 200 mg with no glycyrrhizin claim. The label just says licorice extract 200 mg. The amount of glycyrrhizin does not have to be verified at the RM or the FP stage. The only thing that has to be verified is that 200 mg is in each capsule, and that it is really licorice. In this scenario, the potency of the product has not been verified. It could be high, low, or really low. Scenario 3: The same label of licorice extract 200 mg product as in Scenario 2. The label just says licorice extract 200 mg. The amount of glycyrrhizin does not have to be verified as RM or at FP stage, but the conscientious manufacturer tested anyway to ensure the potency of the material at the RM stage (i.e., how much glycyrrhizin is in the RM). To stay consistent, let us say the potency was 12% glycyrrhizin, because this is the level known to be clinically effective. No need to test at the FP stage because no label claim for a specific potency is made. The only need is to verify that 200 mg is in each capsule. In the end, the potency was verified by the RM testing. The difference between Scenarios 2 and 3 is the DS manufacturer in case 3 had full knowledge and verified the potency of the licorice extract RM, whereas in Scenario 2, the DS manufacturer may not have had a clue as to how potent the FP licorice extract is (high or low) because no testing was performed on the RM or FP. Clearly, no matter what the obligation is regarding potency testing per label claim, it is always best to know the strength of a botanical going into an FP. This can only be accomplished through potency test- ing the RM batch. A point of clarification must be made. Many botani- cal RM products do not have marker compounds to test, or there is no scientifically valid method that exists to perform the potency testing. In this case no potency/strength testing is the only option. Ideally, one should ask and know if a DS manufacturer is routinely conducting potency/strength testing on RMs and/or FPs.

## Does the Product Contain Any Contaminants?

Another way of saying this is: does it have maximum freedom from contamination? Usually, contaminants can only be found through testing the RM. It is generally not possible to detect low level con- tamination by relying on physical inspection and no testing. A physical inspection may find plastic, metal, glass, bug parts, and other filth. As noted previously, the FDA CGMP regulations leave it up to the DS manufacturer to determine whether contaminant testing will be done and, if so, to set the acceptable specification(s) for such testing. Some DS manufacturers perform comprehensive contaminant testing, some perform partial testing, and some perform none. As a prescriber of DSs, which contaminant testing profile makes you feel most com- fortable and safe?

## Solvent Residue

Many vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and glandular prod- ucts are manufactured using one or more chemicals or chemical solvents. Currently, the natural products industry has no limits on chemical or solvent residue allowed in natural products. One could use and comply with the allowable chemical and solvent limits for the pharmaceutical industry. Testing a panel of multiple solvents is rec- ommended when trying to find residual solvent levels in botanicals or nonbotanicals. Why a panel? Most DS suppliers do not give adequate, accurate, or often any information regarding residual solvent levels on the COA for an RM under consideration for purchase. Often DS man- ufacturers in the industry will do no testing for any solvents if there are no solvents listed on the COA. This is a mistake, because when a wide net is cast looking for solvent residue, one or more solvents are frequently found.

## Herbicide, Pesticide, and Fungicide Residue

Ideally, every batch of botanical product purchased should be tested for residual amounts of a variety of herbicides, pesticides, and fungi- cides. Certified organic botanical products can be exempted. There are a number of testing profiles to choose from: FDA, United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), European Pharmacopeia, or the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Testing broadly for organo- chlorines, organophosphates, organonitrogens, and carbamates is ideal and covers a wide spectrum. Every batch should be tested because plant medicines come from all over the world, and various countries have strict or lax rules on what is allowed or not allowed to be applied on crops. Despite rules and regulations in some third- world countries, there could be a lack of enforcement, which creates a big hole for skirting the rules and even more of a reason to test com- prehensively every batch received. For example, testing of a sample of kava extract from Indonesia could reveal residues of dichlorodiphen- yltrichloroethane (DDT), which is banned in the United States and has been for years. The FDA has a zero-tolerance limit for DDT and its metabolites.

## Aflatoxin Residue

Aflatoxins are toxic metabolites produced by certain fungi that are in or on foods and plant materials. Four different aflatoxins, B1, B2, G1, and G2, have been identified, with B1 being the most toxic, car- cinogenic, and prevalent. Aflatoxins are probably the best known and most intensively researched fungal toxins in the world. Aflatoxins have been associated with various diseases, such as aflatoxicosis in livestock, domestic animals, and humans throughout the world. Aflatoxins have received greater attention than any other fungal toxins because of their demonstrated potent carcinogenic effect in susceptible laboratory ani- mals and their acute toxicological effects in humans. Many countries have attempted to limit exposure to aflatoxins by imposing regulatory limits on food and feed for animals. The FDA has set a limit of less than 20 ppb for total aflatoxins in food and feed. The European Union has a much lower overall tolerance (10 ppb), and is more specific for limits on individual aflatoxins, especially B1 at 2 ppb or 5 ppb depending on the food.

## Dioxins, Dioxin-Like Compounds

Testing every batch received is ideal because levels of these chemicals are present from batch to batch. The same can be said for polychlori- nated biphenyls (PCBs), as explained in the following. Fish oil process- ing can remove many of these residues if the crude material is cleaned. Some portion of the crude fish oil sold worldwide and used to make capsules or liquid fish oil is not cleaned and may contain higher levels of these chemicals. Dioxin is a generic term used to describe a family of 210 com- pounds. The most dangerous of this family are 17 members of this group characterized by the presence of chlorine atoms in the 2, 3, 7, and 8 positions. Each of those 2, 3, 7, 8-substituted congeners has been assigned a Toxic Equivalent Factor, which is used for the com- putation of the Toxic Equivalency Quotient. This scale is used in risk assessment studies to calculate the probability of causing cancer and other life-threatening diseases in humans. The European Union has set a fish oil for human consumption tolerance limit for dioxins.

## Polychlorinated Biphenyls

PCBs are a mixture of individual chemicals that are no longer pro- duced in the United States, but are still found in the environment. Health effects that are associated with exposure to PCBs include acne- like skin conditions in adults and neurobehavioral and immunologi- cal changes in children. PCBs are known to cause cancer in animals. The Department of Health and Human Services concluded that PCBs may reasonably be anticipated to be carcinogens. The Environmental Protection Agency and the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that PCBs are probably carcinogenic to humans.

## Rancidity Testing

Oil products ideally should be tested for primary oxidation byprod- ucts (peroxide levels) and secondary oxidation byproducts (anisidine levels). A high level of any of either is indicative of rancidity of long- chain fatty acids in the oil product. It is critical to test for both because peroxides are transitory and can drop to a low level as they transform into secondary oxidation byproducts (anisidines). Once an oil has started down the path of rancidity, it usually proceeds to higher levels of rancidity.

# FINISHED PRODUCT EXPIRATION DATE AND

# STABILITY TESTING

Many DS companies have no data to support their expiration date or “best if used by” claims. The following information is taken from the preamble portion of the FDA DS GMP regulations: “Because the final rule does not require that you establish an expi- ration date, we (the FDA) decline to offer guidance on the type of data that are acceptable to support an expiration date, other than to repeat that any expiration date that you place on a product label (including a ‘‘best if used by’’ date) should be supported by data.” Because the FDA gives no guidance on the matter, what should be asked of a DS manufacturer? Strength/potency testing is probably most important because the potency of the product over time might be crit- ical to the product producing intended results. Some questions to ask are: 1. Are you conducting any stability testing on your FPs? 2. If so, what testing? Strength/potency? Bacteria, yeast, mold testing? 3. If no testing is taking place, are you performing physical parameter inspections (appearance; weight; integrity of the capsule, tablet, or powder, etc.)? 4. If no testing is taking place, how do you verify the strength/potency of the product over the shelf life expiration dating period? What data do you have to support the expiration date period and stability of your product(s)?

# ASSESSING QUALITY VIA COMPREHENSIVE

# TESTING

Start with the concept that “you only find what you look for.” This can and should be applied to DS RM ingredients. When a DS manufacturer buys an RM (domestic or foreign), generally they cannot just tell that the mate- rial is of good quality. The measure of quality of a DS FP is a function of the quality of the ingredients that went into it. If a DS manufacturer looks at the quality of an ingredient in a cursory manner and only performs the

<!-- chunk -->

## 727CHAPTER 96 Natural Medicines Quality Control

most minimal of tests, some essential quality parameters may be missed, and the ingredient goes unverified overall. If comprehensive testing is per- formed for an array of quality parameters, the ingredient may be deemed verified as a quality ingredient if the test results are acceptable. The definition of verification is repeated to make a point about the value of assessing quality via comprehensive testing. To verify means: • To prove the truth of, as by evidence; confirm; substantiate • To ascertain the truth or correctness of, as by examination • To act as ultimate proof or evidence of; serve to confirm. Verification of quality via testing provides evidence, proof, sub- stantiation, and confirmation of quality parameters. How else can it be achieved? Testing is king when it comes to confirming and assessing the quality parameters of DS ingredients and FPs. If a DS manufacturer does extensive and comprehensive testing on all RM ingredients that go into the FP, the overall quality of the FP is mostly assured. To fully ensure quality in this scenario, the only items left to test on the FP would be strength/potency (if potency claims are made) and microbiological profile to make sure it did not become contaminated with bacteria, yeast, or mold as it went through manufacturing. Ideally, the FP would also be run through a metal detector to rule out the possible introduction of metal pieces from the manufacturing process. Finally, if any of the active constit- uents could be damaged by the manufacturing process, such as a heat labile substance, its potency should be checked before quality control release.

# SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION AND SKIP LOT TESTING

The FDA DS CGMPs allow for certifying a DS supplier. Once a DS supplier is certified, the DS manufacturer can perform reduced testing of RM batches (i.e., skip certain testing parameters because they have done enough due diligence to “trust” the DS supplier’s quality). The FDA CGMP regulation in Subpart E, §111.75 states: A firm may rely upon a certificate of analysis (COA) from its sup- plier of a component (in other words, not test), provided that certain criteria are met, which include the following: • The firm first qualifies the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier’s COA through confirmation of the results of the supplier’s tests or examinations • Maintains documentation of how it qualified the supplier • Periodically reconfirms the supplier’s COA • Quality control personnel review and approve the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification (and requalification) of any supplier • Some questions remain regarding these guidelines. The FDA gives no acceptable criteria on establishing reliability of the supplier— does this need to happen once, twice, six times? How was this confirmed? How often is the COA from the supplier reconfirmed? Every year, 2, 3, or 5 years? Officials from the FDA have said the following at numerous trade shows and conferences. Unfortunately, this provides no guidance for DS manufacturers. “We anticipate that Industry will be creative in qualifying the global supply chain.” In addition, the FDA has told the DS industry that qualifying a supplier must include an onsite comprehensive audit of the supplier’s facility (wherever it may be) and manufacturing and quality assurance processes for the ingredients in question.

# LABORATORY TESTING AND LABORATORY

# QUALITY

DSs are tested by contract laboratories to ensure identity (assure authenticity without adulteration), purity (assess contamination levels), and strength (verify the claimed potency). Laboratories use “methods” to test DSs. Ideally, a validated method would be used for the specific item in the specific mix of ingredients. However, few laboratories have adequately validated methods to cover all situations. The most pressing issue regarding laboratory quality assurance is, by far, the lack of available validated methods. Method validation shows that a method is suitable and fit for its purpose—demonstrating accuracy and reproducibility. It is easy to define and hard to imple- ment because many different, time-consuming experiments need to be performed to accomplish it. Method validation is extremely important in the DS industry, especially because the FDA requires manufacturers to support their ingredient label claims. Validating a method proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the results are accurate and reproducible. Method validation is absolutely necessary to ensure the highest degree of reliability. In addition, method validation is needed to settle variant results from labora- tory to laboratory. If the laboratory has a variety of quality systems in place, then this may not be completely necessary within a single laboratory. The quality systems of any laboratory are paramount to achiev- ing the goal of consistently producing accurate, precise, and repro- ducible results. However, there is no systematic way to know that laboratories are producing accurate results. Many of them do not have the necessary systems or methods in place to ensure quality results. Some laboratories start out using a validated method, but later “modify” the method to suit their purposes. By doing this, they invalidate the validation because the method has been changed. This “method rigging” may introduce inaccuracies and unreliability in the results. Quality systems every contract laboratory should employ include: • Use of appropriate reference standards • Repeatability studies • Ensuring system suitability requirements are performed, such as: a. Determining whether the instrument is calibrated properly and operating correctly b. Following written standard operating procedures (SOPs) c. Performing out-of-specification (OOS) studies. An OOS study is triggered when a laboratory gets a test value that is either substan- tially lower or higher than the anticipated value. The OOS study verifies that the laboratory had everything correct (by rechecking all necessary parameters) when the analysis was run. Then the laboratory repeats the analysis to see if the same value is obtained or not d. Regularly performing recovery studies using pure com- pound for recovery to test extraction performance and equip- ment. A recovery study is when the analyst prepares a sample (extraction) with a known concentration of substance and runs it in the machine. The recovery of the result should be the con- centration expected. If not, something is wrong with the equip- ment or sample preparation (extraction) e. Ensuring the method used is based on good, valid science, and is applicable for the DS being tested f. Allowing independent audits of procedures, practices, and data If an officially approved validated method is not available, a scien- tifically valid analytic method is one that is based on scientific data or results published in, for example, scientific journals, references, text- books, or proprietary research. These methods can yield good results if they are not changed to any significant degree and they are appro- priate for the analysis. The author had a schisandra extract (Schisandra chinensis or S. sphenanthe) tested at one laboratory that yielded a 10% schisandrins result and at another laboratory that yielded a less than

<!-- chunk -->

## 728SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

2% result. The first laboratory was using a method that was designed to test material in blood or serum and not a botanical extract. Clearly, it was not a “good science” method because it was not appropriate for the intended purpose. Validated methods are the gold standard for obtaining accurate laboratory results. Unfortunately, official (meaning recognized by the government) or unofficial validated methods do not exist for many dietary supplements. The bottom line: only trust the laboratories that follow and adhere to the quality systems outlined previously and strive to use scientifically valid methods when validated methods are not available.

# ECONOMICALLY MOTIVATED ADULTERATION

Economically motivated adulteration (EMA) is the fraudulent, intentional substitution or addition of a substance in a product for the purpose of increasing the apparent value of the product or reducing the cost of its production (i.e., for economic gain). EMA includes dilution of products with increased quantities of an already present substance (e.g., increasing inactive ingredients of a drug with a resulting reduction in strength of the FP, or watering down of juice) to the extent that such dilution poses a known or possible health risk to consumers, as well as the addition or substitution of substances to mask dilution.

<!-- chunk -->

## Examples of Products That Are Prone to Economically

<!-- chunk -->

## Motivated Adulteration

• Ginkgo biloba extract: The most common method of adulterating ginkgo is to add an inexpensive flavonoid source that artificially inflates the total flavonoid level in the extract to meet the required 24%. Rutin, a flavonoid source extracted from buckwheat with a low cost, has been the most common additive used for this purpose. Sophora japonica (Japanese Pagodatree) is also used to artificially elevate the flavonoid level of ginkgo extract. • Panax and American Ginseng extract: Ginseng root is widely con- sidered the source of the herb’s therapeutic activity; however, large quantities of the leaf can be added to surreptitiously and artificially increase levels of some ginsenosides. • Goldenseal root extract: Goldenseal root naturally contains a com- pound called berberine at a concentration of approximately 4% to 8%. Goldenseal root extract can be spiked with added pure berber- ine or substituted with other berberine containing plants. • Coptis chinensis extract: This can be spiked with berberine or substi- tuted with other berberine containing plants. • Bilberry extract 25% anthocyanosides: The anthocyanoside content can be manipulated by blending in cheaper berries, such as black currant and elderberries; reports showed even amaranth dye has been used to spike bilberry in an attempt to fool the testing and pass as a quality product.1 • Saw palmetto extract: This extract may be spiked with exhausted plant effluent (powder left over after the plant is extracted) or adul- terated with palm oil. Addition of palm oil allows for the fatty acid content to meet the claim, but it throws off the natural balance of fatty acids in the extract, which can be detected with proper testing. In addition, unripe berries can be used versus the traditional use of ripe fruit. • Grape seed extract: Addition of cheap flavonoids can allow a poor-quality product to pass as high-quality product. • Black cohosh extract: Other cohosh species are used rather than Cimicifuga racemosa. The substituted species are not therapeuti- cally active or have a different therapeutic activity. • Pomegranate extract: Ellagic acid can be added to the pomegran- ate extract to fraudulently meet the guaranteed amount in the final extract without spending the money on expensive pomegranate dry material. • Fish oil: This can be adulterated with vegetable oils. Proper analytic testing of the fatty acid profile and examination of fat ratios can usually detect if a fish oil product has had vegetable oil added. • Protein powders: Addition of a plastic-like agent called melamine can artificially raise the apparent protein level. A test is available to detect the adulteration of protein powders with melamine. Melamine can cause serious health problems, including death.

# RESIDUAL CHEMICAL SOLVENTS IN DIETARY

# SUPPLEMENTS

It is important to note that solvent residue testing is not mandated as part of the FDA guidelines for CGMPs in regard to DSs. It is up to the DS manufacturers themselves to determine whether solvent residue testing is needed. This is a big hole in the FDA CGMPs because many RM compo- nents used to manufacturer DSs have some level of chemical solvent residue. The question is how much chemical residue is present, and is the level acceptable, safe, and will not cause harm over a long period of ingestion? Hence unacceptable residual solvent levels will be an ongo- ing quality challenge for many DS manufacturers and thus an ongoing quality concern.

<!-- chunk -->

## A Solvent Primer

The issue of solvents is complex and involved. Official US policy began in 1997 when a joint initiative involving both regulators and research- based industry members from numerous countries published the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline, Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents. This was then adopted by the FDA. Based on these guidelines, the USP revised Chapter 467, “Residual Solvents,” in 2007. This then became official policy on July 1, 2008. Basically, there are four classes of solvents. The following is a simple primer based on the more current USP revisions.2 Note that these guidelines are for pharmaceutical products. There are no guidelines for DSs. So, in the absence of DS residual solvent guidelines, it seems obvious to use the existing standard for pharma- ceuticals rather than do nothing and completely ignore the issue.

<!-- chunk -->

## Class I Solvents

These solvents should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, and drug products (and hence natural medi- cines, either) because of their unacceptable toxicity or their deleterious environmental effects. However, to produce a drug product (or nat- ural medicine), if their use is unavoidable, then their levels should be restricted, as shown in Table 96.1.

<!-- chunk -->

## Class II Solvents

These solvents should be limited in use because of their inherent toxic- ity. There are 27 in this category, with acceptable limits from 50 to ppm. Some examples are chloroform, cyclohexane, hexane, methanol, and toluene.

<!-- chunk -->

## Class III Solvents

These solvents are regarded as less toxic and of lower risk to human health. There are also 27 in this category, all with limits of 5000 ppm. Some examples are acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and methyl acetate.

# THE BUYING DECISION

Most consumers and practitioners do little or nothing to assess and verify product quality before they choose a supplier or make a buying decision. All too often our buying decisions are based on what other people, clinicians, educators, books, magazines, and DS company mar- keting materials have told us. We may like an ad, the packaging, the salesperson, believe the company’s quality story, be influenced by their marketing claims, or recognize that the company has good clinical education that ties their products to the education piece. In essence, usually everything but evidence of quality verification drives our deci- sion. It is critical to verify quality claims. To verify is to prove the truth of something by presentation of evi- dence. People do not usually ask for that evidence to verify that a man- ufacturer is providing verified quality products. Why not? Probably because we are too busy, we assume companies are providing the quality we seek, we are not educated enough to know how to separate the marketing hype from the real evidence of quality verification, and lastly the average person may be too intimidated to call the company and ask very pointed quality questions. This is a huge missing piece. Health care professionals would be wise to demand to see the evidence that supports the marketing claims of quality products. If we choose not to, we must realize that we could be prescribing subpotent, inauthentic, and/or contaminated products. The author (and editors) has seen far too many examples of subpo- tency, lack of authenticity, contamination, and a general lack of quality assurance all across the supply chain that feeds the natural products industry. If we think that all the companies we purchase from have done all their quality assurance homework and have applied it, we need to think again. We do not know because most companies do not divulge what they do or, more importantly, what they do not do regarding the full story of the quality assurance they apply to their products. The bottom line take home message is this: step out of your com- fort zone and call companies you intend to purchase from and do your best to determine their quality practices by asking very pointed questions and requesting some proof to support their answers. You can read and become familiar with the questionnaire provided in this chapter to give you some idea of what to ask for. Asking for some level of accountability from the company you plan to buy from is better than blindly assuming they are performing adequate quality assurance to protect you and your patients. Verifying the quality of a brand has to be done by asking the com- pany if they have in place and consistently follow a comprehensive testing protocol to test RMs and FPs at release and conduct FP stabil- ity testing. You can use the questionnaire provided here to give you information and guidance on what questions to ask and the necessary information to gather.

# DIETARY SUPPLEMENT PRICING AND QUALITY

A specific brand of DS may carry a high price. A high or low priced DS does not necessarily correlate with product quality. Two thoughts to consider regarding price and quality: First, a low or very low priced DS product is not likely to have been put through comprehensive qual- ity testing. The cost of consistently performing comprehensive qual- ity testing on DS products is very steep, and product pricing needs to reflect that financial investment. Second, full adherence with DS FDA CGMPs is very, very costly, as it requires financial investments in test- ing, personnel education and training, facility system changes, and experienced quality managers to run the quality department and com- ply with developing and maintaining the volumes of documentation dictated by FDA CGMPs. The days of cheap DSs are probably coming to an end.

# CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE

# CERTIFIED PROGRAMS

In the United States and abroad, there are government and nongov- ernment agencies that conduct audits of DS manufacturers to assess their CGMP compliance with the standard set by the auditing agency. If the DS manufacturer successfully passes one or more necessary audits, it gets a “CGMP Compliant” or “CGMP Certified” certificate from the auditing agency. DS manufacturers use these certifications to trumpet their quality. The comprehensive nature of the audit pro- cess and criteria applied to receive a pass varies from auditing body to auditing body. All certification programs contain some value, but some may have serious limitations and may not tell clinicians all they need to know to trust a DS manufacturer and their products. Be aware that certification does not guarantee quality, and also that lack of certi- fication does not mean lack of quality. There are items to consider regarding these independent CGMP certifying bodies. First, the FDA CGMPs trump all of these auditing bodies because compliance with the FDA legally required regulations are currently most important. I have already described some of the “confusing and not spelled out” FDA CGMP interpretation and com- pliance issues. Until those issues are defined and specified, any outside auditing agency is making their best guess and applying their inter- pretation of what will pass with the FDA. Second, the most important quality practice to verify and understand with any DS manufacturer is how comprehensively they conduct testing to verify identity, strength/ potency, purity (contamination), and shelf life dating. None of these CGMP Certified seals will give you that information. You must attempt to get that information directly from the DS company.

## Claims and Testing Practices

The road to ensuring high quality is successfully traveled when clini- cians ask for, obtain, and evaluate DS manufacturer supplied infor- mation on CGMP compliance and valid evidence (test results) of a product’s identity (authenticity), purity (maximum freedom from contamination), strength/potency, and shelf-life strength. A questionnaire entitled, “The Manufacturer Quality Assurance Self-Audit Form,” is available for use.3 It is reprinted in the Appendix. The form is intended to give clinicians a basis upon which to question or request documentation from manufacturers and/or suppliers about

their quality control/quality assurance practices and testing programs. There is also an attending compliance document that can be used to evaluate some of the responses obtained from DS manufacturers. “Not having the information you need when you need it leaves you wanting. Not knowing where to look for that information leaves you powerless. In a society where information is king, none of us can afford that.”

## 732SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

A growing body of research implicates excessive oxidative damage in multiple disease processes as well as aging. This chapter first examines free radicals and reactive oxygen species, in oxidative stress as partici- pants in cell signaling, then considers the role of antioxidants in redox regulation in human health.

# FREE RADICALS AND NONRADICAL OXIDANTS

<!-- chunk -->

## Free Radicals

These molecules possess an unpaired electron; therefore they partic- ipate in single-electron oxidations. In the body, the hydroxyl radical (•OH) is one of the most reactive free radicals, precluding any use- ful physiological role. Less reactive radicals, nitric oxide (NO•) and superoxide (O 2 •−), are able to participate in autocrine and paracrine functions. In isolated systems, a chain initiation event generates free radicals, such as alkyl (RO•) and peroxyl (ROO•) radicals. Radical propagation steps repeated many times can lead to chain reactions. However, it is unlikely that free radical chain reactions are propa- gated in vivo, due to abundant molecular targets, radical scavenging enzymes, and low-molecular-weight antioxidants. In addition to free radicals, the body generates an array of nonrad- ical oxidizing agents that participate in electron-pair oxidations. This group includes hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), lipid peroxides (ROOH), hypochlorite, peroxynitrite, quinones, and disulfides. Nonradical oxi- dants vary in their reactivity, with hypochlorite and peroxynitrite rep- resenting potent oxidizers and H 2 O 2 a much less reactive, diffusible signaling molecule.

## Reactive Oxygen Species

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent more or less reactive oxidiz- ing agents, whether or not they are free radicals. They include super- oxide and H 2 O 2 . H 2 O 2 is not very reactive; however, it spontaneously forms hydroxyl radicals in the presence of iron and copper ions. Superoxide is not highly reactive, either, and superoxide concentra- tions in the cytoplasm and mitochondria are usually held in check by superoxide dismutases (SODs), which yield H 2 O 2 . Nonspecific usage of the term ROS is not useful because “ROS” cannot be induced, mea- sured, or inhibited. As oxidizing agents, individual rate constants vary from 2 × 10–2 to 2 × 109. Normal metabolism generates ROS according to several mecha- nisms and initiates a variety of toxic reactions, including lipid peroxi- dation, direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, inhibition of membrane sodium/potassium ATP-ase activity, and inactivation of membrane sodium channels, which all play a role in the pathophysiol- ogy of inflammation (Fig. 97.1).

## Oxidases

Nicotine adenine disphosphonucleotide (NADPH) oxidase is the only enzyme that exclusively produces superoxide; therefore it is carefully regulated. Peroxisomes oxidize fatty acids while produc- ing ROS. Xanthine oxidase oxidizes purines from DNA, RNA, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Microsomal mixed-function oxi- dases (cytochrome P450) generate ROS in the detoxification of metabolites and xenobiotics. Drugs that cause peroxisome prolif- eration, such as clofibrate, can stimulate the production of H 2 O 2 by this mechanism.

## Cyclooxygenase and Lipoxygenase

Inflammation activates the arachidonic acid cascade, which converts arachidonate to eicosanoids that mediate inflammation and activate NADPH oxidase to increase the production of ROS.1

## Oxygen

In the presence of reduced iron or copper ions, oxygen can produce H 2 O 2 and hydroxyl radicals. Oxygen can also react spontaneously with heme proteins such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c to generate superoxide. Excessive iron and iron overload may cause hydroxyl radical production. Consequently, the release of iron from storage sites during inflammation and injury may promote the sponta- neous production of free radicals.2

## Oxidative Stress

The term oxidative stress refers to a shift in the ratio of reducing agents to oxidants and its consequences in the body. In this sense, oxidative stress occurs when oxidants outweigh the various antioxidant systems as a result of excessive ROS production and/or limited antioxidant defenses. An expanded definition of oxidative stress now includes dys- functional redox signaling and imbalanced regulatory mechanisms, which emphasizes the role in signal transduction. During oxidative stress, endogenous defenses may be consumed, or they may not be replenished by recycling. Decreased dietary intake of antioxidant nutri- ents or malabsorption syndromes can reduce antioxidant defenses and create chronic imbalances, setting the stage for disease.

# OXIDATIVE STRESS AND TOXICANT EXPOSURE

## Toxic Metals

Arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead have all been shown to cause increased DNA oxidation, measurable with 8-OHdG. Iron, copper, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt undergo redox-cycling reactions producing toxicity, whereas mercury, cadmium, and nickel deplete glutathione and bond to sulfhydryl groups of proteins.3 Lead not only generates ROS but also causes a reduction in the activity of ROS- quenching enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glu- tathione peroxidase, resulting in diminished antioxidant defense. At the cellular level, cadmium provokes the generation of ROS, which indirectly modulates gene expression and signal transduction and reduces the activities of proteins involved in antioxidant defenses.4 The carcinogenic effect of arsenic may be related to the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors involving NF-k β and AP-1.5

## Persistent Organic Pollutants

Exposure to organophosphate pesticides will lead to DNA oxidative damage, resulting in an increase of 8-OHdG. Malathion, a commonly used organophosphate pesticide, generates free radicals that induce oxidative stress in human erythrocytes through the inhibition of cat- alase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase.6 Oxidative stress from malathion exposure may also be a result of damage to mitochondrial complexes by inhibiting the activity of Complex IV.7 A positive correlation has been found between farmers exposed to pesti- cides and oxidative stress biomarkers.8

## Air Pollution

Diesel exhaust particles, probably the most toxic component of urban outdoor air pollutants, are a mixture of carbon particles, organic chem- icals, heavy metals, and free radicals, causing DNA oxidative damage that is measurable with elevated 8-OHdG levels. Persons exposed to traffic in their work (e.g., traffic officers) have higher levels of 8-OHdG, indicative of increased oxidative damage.9 Urban air pollution has long been positively associated with respi- ratory and cardiac problems and increased mortality rates. Particulate matter (PM) is one of the major components of urban air pollution and has been linked to increased levels of 8-OHdG. PM causes sig- nificant oxidative damage in the tissues and organs to which it is dis- tributed and has been associated with increased mortality, primarily from cardiovascular,10 respiratory,11 and neoplastic diseases.12 A study in Taiwan demonstrated that exposure to indoor air pollutants caused an increase in oxidative damage, aggravating sick building syndrome– related symptoms.13 Peruvian women exposed to wood smoke from indoor cooking fires also had higher urinary 8-OHdG levels.14

## Drugs

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to induce ROS in cardiac and cardiovascular-related cells, which may explain the increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with NSAID use. Rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, was removed from the market because its extended use was found to increase the risk of atherothrombotic events. It is now known that the cardiotoxicity of rofecoxib was not related to COX-2 inhibition but rather to the oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins and cellular membrane lipids, which contributed to plaque instability and thrombus formation.15

## Radiation

Ionizing radiation can cause DNA damage, gene mutation, apoptosis, and cancer. The toxic effects of radiation result from rapid generation of ROS through radiolysis of water molecules as well as secondary reac- tions leading to increased levels of ROS, which can diffuse within the cell and delay the toxic effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tobacco

Chronic tobacco smoke inhalation induces an intracellular oxidative environment characterized by decreased concentrations of circulating antioxidants, increased oxidation of glutathione, and increased levels of DNA damage. Tobacco smoke has long been linked with elevated levels of 8-OHdG in smokers and in those exposed to secondhand smoke. One study of smokers showed 50% higher 8-OHdG levels com- pared with nonsmokers,16 with cessation of smoking resulting in a 21% drop in 8-OHdG levels after 4 weeks.17

# OXIDATIVE STRESS, AGING, AND CHRONIC

# DISEASE

Aging refers to the time-dependent alteration in function in the form of cellular and systemic functional decline, with increased morbidity and mortality. The increased prevalence of chronic degenerative dis- eases can be viewed in terms of irreversible cellular deficits.

## Free Radical Theory of Aging

According to the free radical theory of aging, free radicals from normal metabolism or external sources gradually overcome antioxidant mech- anisms, leading to cumulative oxidative damage to essential cellular elements: proteins, DNA, and lipids.18 More than 100 conditions provide circumstantial evidence linking oxidative damage to disease processes, although these correlations do not distinguish cause or consequence. This list includes several forms of cancer,19,20 atherosclerosis,21,22 hypertension, diabetes mellitus,23 cataracts,24 inflammation and autoimmune disease,25,26 lung disease,27 neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease,28,29 hepatitis,30 obesity,31 and fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome,32 in addition to cell death33 and attributes of aging.34,35 Psychological stress and responses to social stressors can affect antiox- idant enzymes and oxidative stress, and vice versa.36

## 734SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

Oxidative stress is linked to aging and senescence in two lines of research. One is based on increased levels of oxidative products in senescent cells and organs. As an example, carbonylated proteins were markedly elevated in the last third of life in human lens, brain, and skin fibroblasts and rat liver.37 The second, stress-induced prema- ture senescence, demonstrates that a chronic stress response, induced in cells using subtoxic levels of H 2 O 2 or other oxidants, can lead to a senescence phenotype (gene overexpression). The consequences of oxidative stress are often subtle: Increased membrane fluidity and damage to membrane receptor proteins may alter cellular regulatory mechanisms such as signal transduction, inac- tivation of proteins required for ATP production, or calcium homeo- stasis. The more or less continuous production of ROS by activated phagocytes during chronic, possibly low-level inflammation may even- tually deplete antioxidant defenses, allowing ROS to attack cells, with ensuing tissue injury. Recognition of mitochondrial dysfunction led to an update of free radical theory.38 An estimated 3% of oxygen molecules passing through mitochondria are converted to superoxide due to leakage of the electron transport chain.39 Thus mitochondria can be considered a prominent source of ROS. Mitochondria also produce H 2 O 2 and lipid peroxides, which can damage highly susceptible mitochondrial DNA and alter mito- chondrial membrane permeability to release apoptogenic substances such as cytochrome c. H 2 O 2 can act as a powerful inducer of a senescent phe- notype across multiple cell types.40 Elevated ROS produced by impaired mitochondria has been suggested as a primary cause of aging.41

## Hydroxyl Radicals, Nitric Oxide, and Peroxynitrite

Hydroxyl radicals are extremely powerful oxidants, and they probably diffuse only several angstroms before attacking cell constituents and forming characteristic decomposition products of lipids, proteins, and DNA.42 Superoxide rapidly forms hydroxyl radicals in the presence of transition metal ions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Reactive Nitrogen Species: Linkage to Superoxide

Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) include peroxynitrite and its reaction products, such as NO 2 . High, sustained levels of NO and superoxide, precursors of peroxynitrite (ONOO−), are associated with tissue tox- icity, cancer, and inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, juvenile diabetes, and ulcerative colitis.43 Under inflammatory conditions, simultaneous production of superoxide and NO can increase 1000- fold, and production of peroxynitrite can increase by a million-fold.44 Associated oxidative stress can result from increased production of superoxide, which reacts spontaneously with NO to produce (ONOO−). Excessive superoxide can come from upregulated xanthine oxidase or cytochrome P450. ROS uncouple nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to pro- duce superoxide rather than NO. Thus exposure of human endothelial cells to lysophosphatidylcholine leads to downregulation of endothelial NOS and SOD and thus a superoxide overload.45,46 As a highly reactive peroxide, ONOO− yields secondary free radicals as nitrogen dioxide. A preponderance of NO and superoxide toxicity is due to ONOO−, triggering nitration reaction and cell death.47 In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, an isoform of NADPH oxidase, NOX1, is up-regulated. Mice deficient in NOX1 had increased protein nitrotyrosine adducts in hepatic sinusoids, as did wild-type mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. Up-regulation of NOX1 in sinu- soidal endothelial cells may be responsible for peroxynitrite-mediated cell injury.48

## Reactive Oxygen Species: Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics

Infection, toxic exposure, ischemia, and trauma activate phagocytic cells—macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils—to create ROS.49 The binding of immune complexes, bacterial endotox- ins, or other inflammatory agents to cell-surface receptors triggers a respiratory burst, a localized production of ROS able to oxidize viruses and bacteria. Excessive superoxide from NADPH oxidase undergoes dismutation to H 2 O 2 via SOD. Myeloperoxidase in lysosomes then converts H 2 O 2 and the chloride ion to hypochlorite, which sponta- neously produces highly reactive chloramines from amines.

## Cascades

Physiological levels of ROS influence cell regulatory processes as diverse as apoptosis, cell growth, and chemotaxis.50,51 Many signal cas- cades are sensitive to redox balance and can be modulated by ROS and antioxidants. Essential to these pathways are multiple protein kinases, whose phosphorylation products are often other kinases or kinase inhibitors. Related protein phosphatases reverse those effects. Rather than isolated enzyme systems, cross talk is achieved via ROS and RNX signaling to control responses, such as inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Transcription Factors

Nuclear factor- κ B (NF- κ B) and activating protein-1 (AP-1) help regu- late inflammation and the response to oxidative stress. These factors bind to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in promoter regions to induce transcription of proinflammatory molecules. Transcription factors can boost defenses against ROS, depending on which signaling cascade is activated, to increase transcription of glutathione-S transferase (GSH S-transferase), metallothionein-1, and manganese-dependent SOD.

The NF- κ B pathway represents a premier proinflammatory signaling pathway by proinflammatory cytokines as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α ). Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promote NF- κ B activation. NF- κ B upreg- ulation leads to the production of cytokines, chemokines, and adhe- sion molecules. As such, it may contribute to chronic oxidative stress and diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and even overweight and obesity.52 With age, NF- κ B expression in the body increases, a link to chronic systemic inflammation.

## Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2 Related Factor-2

Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf2) acts as a master redox switch in cellular defense against oxidative stress. It induces anti- oxidative enzymes, Phase II detoxifying enzymes, and stress-respon- sive proteins, as well as NADPH:quinone reductase, glutamate cysteine ligase, GSH S-transferase, GSH peroxidase (GPx), and thioredoxin. Nrf2 also controls genes involved in metabolism, such as NADPH gen- eration and oxidation of fatty acids, while suppressing those involved in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis.53 Release from its inactive cyto- plasmic complex is redox-dependent.54

## Activating Protein-1

The transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) controls addi- tional processes affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis suppression, including COX-2 expression. As an example of AP-1 activation, epi- dermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor bind to their receptors, activating phosphatidylinositol kinase, followed by Rac (guanosine triphosphatase [GTPase]) activation, in turn stimulating NADPH oxidase to produce superoxide.55

phospholipids, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (extracellular signal-regulated kinases, Jun N-terminal kinase [JNK], and p38 kinases), and tyrosine protein kinases. Related phosphatases reverse their actions. Members of these broad enzyme families partic- ipate in posttranscriptional control due to their redox-sensitive cyste- inyl domains.56 As cell-signaling proteins, PKCs are especially sensitive to redox stress and to ROS as a second messenger during the cell pro- liferation and differentiation essential for cardiovascular health.57 As an example, vasocontraction occurs when angiotensin II binds to its receptor and activates PKC, in turn activating NADPH oxidase to pro- duce superoxide, which destroys NO. As another example, H 2 O 2 from SOD can oxidize catalytic cysteinyl moieties of tyrosine phosphatases, thereby preventing inactivation of tyrosine kinases, including Src, to stimulate AP-1.

## Proinflammatory Cytokines

Transcription factors can be activated by inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- α . AP-1 activation (with NF- κ B inhibition) blocks the pro- duction of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1 β , IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF- α .

<!-- chunk -->

## Proinflammatory Eicosanoids

The arachidonate cascade features proinflammatory hydroperoxides and endoperoxide eicosanoids: prostaglandins such as PGG 2 , PGH 2 , and PGE 2 (via COX); leukotrienes; and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (via lipoxygenase). COX-2 can be induced by superoxide, H 2 O 2 , and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- α . Stimulated lipox- ygenase can trigger ROS production through sequential activation of GTPase (Rac), PKC, and phosphorylation of the NOx subunit of NADPH oxidase, leading to activation of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and ultimately to superoxide synthesis.58

## Calcium Homeostasis

Transcription factors can also be regulated through calcium-signaling mechanisms, and H 2 O 2 can stimulate calcium release from mitochon- dria. Thus H 2 O 2 increases l-type calcium channels and calcium influx by vascular smooth muscle cells linked to hypertension.59

## Apoptosis and Cell-Cycle Regulation

Programmed cell death is regulated by complex pathways involving the transcription factors described previously; therefore, it, too, relies on the cellular redox balance.

## Nitric Oxide

Physiological NO levels regulate multiple processes; thus NO pro- duced by the endothelial isoform of NOS (eNOS) regulates vasodila- tion. In response to proinflammatory cytokines, large amounts of NO are produced during inflammation by phagocytic cells via the induc- ible isoform (iNOS).64 NO participates in protein S-nitrosylation. NO reacts with cysteinyl residues to form S-nitrosothiols. As an example, increased NO production yields reversible cysteinyl S-nitrosylation at the active site of protein tyrosine phosphatases.65 High levels of NO induce apoptosis by stimulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This activates the AKDK1, cyclic-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1), and JNK pathways, ultimately leading to active caspases that trigger cell death.66

## Hydrogen Peroxide

The primary source of H 2 O 2 is superoxide, constitutively produced by mitochondria and NADPH oxidases. To control H 2 O 2 , catalase and peroxidases specifically degrade H 2 O 2 , whereas SOD limits superoxide to curtail H 2 O 2 accumulation. A high steady-state level of H 2 O 2 , asso- ciated with chronic inflammation, increases the production of NF- κ B and AP-1 via posttranscriptional modification. H 2 O 2 oxidizes cysteinyl moieties in redox-switching proteins; this process activates tyrosine kinases and inhibits related phosphatases,67 leading to nuclear factor translocation to promote neutrophil binding with increased expres- sion of adhesion molecules, including vascular cell adhesion mole-

## cule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).

ROS, like H 2 O 2 , can oxidize GSH peroxidase, peroxiredoxins (Prx), and inactive transcription factors directly by oxidizing cysteinyl moi- eties, leading to the formation of protein disulfides or sulfenic acid derivatives.68 Chronic vascular oxidative stress may reflect nonspecific host responses with induction of the NF- κ B pathway and repression of the Nrf2 pathway.69

# LABORATORY ASSESSMENT OF OXIDATIVE STRESS

Current methods measure a small fraction of potential oxidation products, given the wide range of ROS and possible cell targets. Measurement of oxidized macromolecules due to ROS provides three classes of biomarkers: protein oxidation products, lipid oxidation products, and nucleic acid oxidation products. These include prod- ucts of protein degradation as protein carbonyls70 and nitrosylated adducts; urinary and/or plasma products of lipid peroxidation, such as F 2 isoprostanes70 and aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde from lipid fragmentation; as well as products of purine oxidation, such as 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine.34,71 Antibody-based methods have been used to identify and quantify oxidative posttranslational modified proteins. The most common include Western blotting, immune staining, and immunocytochemis- try, although accuracy relies on the specificity of antibodies used.72 As an example, systemic nitro-oxidative stress has been studied in peri- natal asphyxia and neonatal hypoglycemia.73,74 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to free radical attack, yielding hydroperoxides in situ, which are released from membranes by phospholipases. Other lipid oxidation products include ketones such as 4-hydroxynonenal. The accuracy of analysis of unmodified or derivatized lipids by chro- matography/mass spectroscopy far exceeds that of the commonly used thiobarbituric acid (TBAR) assays. The guanine moiety of DNA is particularly susceptible to oxi- dation, yielding a premutagenic lesion involved in GC:TA trans- version mutations.75 Inflammation and oxidative stress are related mechanistically, and certain markers of systemic inflammation offer a secondary window to examine oxidative stress. C-reactive protein can serve as a marker for systemic inflammation, as well as liver dysfunction,76 and levels can be reduced by antioxidant supplementation.77 Gamma-glutamyltransferase ( γ -glutamyltranspeptidase [GTT]) is linked to the redox state and to the GSH/oxidized GSH (GSSH) bal- ance; therefore it promotes GSH production. GTT may be useful in

# ANTIOXIDANTS

Generally, antioxidants inhibit the oxidation of molecules targeted by radicals and ROS.81 To prevent oxidative stress, organisms possess an elegant antioxidative defense network. Broadly, antioxidants can be classified as endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous antioxidants include proteins as blood constituents, metal ion–binding proteins and enzymes, as well as low-molecular-weight molecules produced by metabolism. Exogenous antioxidants can be considered dietary con- stituents in animal products, fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods. Endogenous and exogenous antioxidant systems cooperate and rely on each other for optimal effectiveness. There is an apparent “pecking order” among antioxidants; some are more readily oxidized than others and will be consumed rapidly unless replenished or recycled.82 Certain antioxidants are preventive inhibitors that block the initiation of free radical attack. Preventive inhibitors include defensive enzymes such as catalase, SOD, and perox- idases (GPx), as well as low-molecular-weight compounds, including reduced GSH. Beta-carotene, chelating agents such as organic acids, and plant polyphenols represent preventive antioxidants when they quench singlet oxygen or sequester metal ion catalysts. Antioxidants can function as chain breakers, which convert free radicals to stable products and thus block free radical chain reactions. Vitamin E and ascorbic acid are chain-breaking antioxidants.

## Laboratory Assessment of Antioxidant Activity

Successful preventive measures for ROS-related disease rely on the early assessment of the presence of oxidative stress and its molecular sequelae. As a starting point, accurate measurement of the total anti- oxidant capacity may assist in evaluating both physiological and nutri- tional factors involved.83 The ferric ion reducing ability (FRAP) assay has been used to correlate serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) with metabolic risk factors. Ingestion of foods with high TAC values was found to reduce markers of systemic inflammation and liver dysfunc- tion.76,84 Other methods rely on peroxyl radical scavenging (ORAC), total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP), total oxidant scavenging capacity (TOSC), hydroxyl radical scavenging (deoxyribose assay), and organic radical scavenging (DPPH). Although international standards are unavailable, these protocols continue to be used, for example, to study the effects of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D supplementa- tion on pregnancy outcomes in patients with gestational diabetes.85 As a further example, the ORAC is often used to compare the antioxi- dant activity of foods and complex mixtures. This assay measures the decay in fluorescence (possibly from peroxyl radicals), and results are expressed as “trolox equivalents.”86 ORAC values for foods were published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).87 However, the USDA removed the ORAC database from its website after concluding that values of antioxidant capacity are not relevant to physiological effects of putative bioactive compounds. The TAC content (FRAC) of more than 3000 foods and supplements has also appeared.88 It can be misleading to market the health benefits of foods based on measures of total antioxidant content. Yet some evidence suggests the utility of ORAC values to assess dietary and oxidant intake and guide choices of foods and natural products, with the goal of reducing the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome.89,90 Cellular antioxidant activity (CAA), as mea- sured by the ability to quench peroxyl radical-induced fluorescence of a fluorescein probe in cultured hepatoma cells, was developed to account for update and metabolism of antioxidants.91 It is worth not- ing that CAA values of flavonoids do not correlate with ORAC values. Studies of ROS and radical quenching by antioxidants frequently employ single time points (end-point assays). A more reliable approach evaluates the IC 50 , the concentration of antioxidant yielding 50% inhi- bition of a given oxidant or radical. It also is important to compare antioxidant activities in several assay systems. Studies showed that pro- cyanidolic oligomers (PCOs) found in numerous foods and used in supplements (e.g., pine bark and grape seed extract) effectively quench diphenyl picrylhydrazyl radicals.93 Galloyl catechins were shown to be more effective than simple catechins in the inhibition of NADPH- dependent lipid peroxidation of rat liver microsomes.92

## Copper, and Zinc

SODs efficiently convert superoxide to H 2 O 2 . The mitochondrial iso- form (SOD2) requires manganese, whereas the cytoplasmic (SOD1) and extracellular (SOD3) enzymes require both copper and zinc. SOD2 is induced during acute inflammation,94 whereas SOD3 in vessel walls plays a major role in regulating vascular ROS.95 Knockout mice lacking SOD2 die several days after birth due to massive oxidative damage. Mice lacking SOD1 develop ROS-related pathologies with reduced life span. Several lines of evidence suggest an involvement of SOD in neurological abnormalities. Mutations in the SOD1 gene account for 20% of patients with a familial dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although the mechanism is unknown.96 Overexpression of SOD2 in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease was shown to reduce brain superoxide and prevent memory losses.97 SOD may be effective in treating experimental ulcerative coli- tis.98 High-risk premature infants treated with prophylactic recombi- nant human SOD1 had reduced early pulmonary injury at 1 year.99 SOD supplementation may also improve stress and fatigue in healthy adults.100 Intravenous administration of derivatized SOD can raise SOD activity in adults. 101 Micronutrient supplementation can increase endogenous SOD among patients with type 2 diabetes administered a combination of vitamins E and C.102 In a rabbit model, copper sup- plementation inhibited the progression of atherosclerosis via increased SOD expression and potentiating NO-mediated pathways.103 Indeed, serum SOD is linked to vascular function in hypersensitive and dia- betic patients.104

## Catalase

The iron-dependent enzyme catalase converts H 2 O 2 to diatomic oxy- gen extremely efficiently. It occurs widely in cells and is a component of peroxisomes. Animal studies with catalase, usually in conjunction with SOD, suggest protection against ischemic injury to the lung,105 intestinal ROS damage,106 and radiation.107 Examination of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries revealed that vascular antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, were selectively elevated in smooth mus- cle cells and macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions.108 In contrast, knockout mice lacking catalase were phenotypically normal, possibly due to effective scavenging by peroxidases.109 In the cardiac proteome of wild-type and transgenic mice, overexpression of catalase was linked to decreased cysteinyl oxidation among 82 proteins, including mito- chondrial and contractile proteins, implicated in pathways of cardiac disease.110

several isoforms. GPx-1 is a cytoplasmic isoform that prefers H 2 O 2 as a substrate. GPx-4 has a high affinity for lipid hydroperoxides, reducing membrane lipid peroxides to nontoxic fatty acid alcohols.111 GPx-1 expression is regulated in part by the availability of sele- nium and by selenocysteine during protein synthesis. By limiting H 2 O 2 accumulation, GPx-1 can modulate mitochondrial function and growth-factor–mediated regulation. GPx has been implicated in age-related diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Antioxidant enzymes, including extracellular GSH peroxidase, are induced by the oxidative stress associated with lung diseases.112 GPx-1 can block oxidative stress induced by cigarette smoke. Among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, exposure to cigarette smoke provoked protein unfolding in lung epithelial cells, which was reversed in vitro by GPx-1.113 Mice lacking GPx-1 have a normal life span; however, they develop early cataracts. In contrast, GPx-4 knock- out mice do not survive early embryonic development.114

Prxs control intracellular levels of H 2 O 2 to regulate cell signaling in various cell types and have been implicated in carcinogenesis, tumor metastasis, and drug resistance. Mice lacking PrxI or PrxII develop severe hemolytic anemia and are prone to cancer due to elevated H 2 O 2 . Prx1 knockout mice exhibit atherosclerotic lesions due to endothelial cell dysfunction.115 NO may protect macrophages against oxidative and nitrosative stress by inducing Prx.116 PrxII can express dual roles in cancer progression. Decreased expression is correlated with enhanced proliferation and metastasis of melanoma cells. In contrast, PrxII has been shown to be overexpressed in prostate, cervical, and esophageal cancer. PrxII also plays a role in colorectal cancer, apparently by help- ing maintain colorectal cancer stem cell–like behavior.117

## Storage and Transport Proteins

## Ferritin, Transferrin, and Ceruloplasmin

Free iron and copper ions catalyze the conversion of H 2 O 2 to hydroxyl radicals; therefore proteins that bind these ions help protect tissues against ROS. Transferrin (which has a high affinity for iron) and ceruloplasmin (which binds copper) can be considered part of the antioxidant defenses.118 Iron stored in ferritin does not participate in the generation of free radicals. Under normal circumstances, little unbound iron is present in cells. However, with chronic inflammation, unbound iron may be released from ferritin, posing a potential hazard. Iron storage disease is linked to oxidative damage. Studies of H 2 O 2 - resistant cell lines suggest that adaptation to chronic oxidative stress includes increased cellular antioxidant defenses, including elevated levels of mitochondrial ferritin, GSH, and GPx.119

## Metallothionein

Metallothionein, a small, cysteine-rich protein, binds many metals. It exists as isoforms, induced by cytokines, toxic metals, oxidative stress, inflammation, axonal development, and apoptosis. Mitochondrial- specific ROS generators can increase the production of metallo- thionein in the liver by 3.7- to 11.8-fold in mice, far more than SOD or GSH peroxidase.120 Similarly, acute ethanol-induced hepatotox- icity and associated oxidative stress were curtailed in mice that had been genetically manipulated to overexpress metallothionein, com- pared with wild-type mice.121 The isoform MT-II is mainly expressed in neurons and is induced by oxidative stress and metals. It has been implicated in neuroprotection and after brain injury. Using an in vitro model of stroke as well as animals with cerebral artery occlu- sion, exogenous application of MT-II was shown to protect against ischemic injury.122

## Selenoprotein P

Nearly 60% of plasma selenium is represented by selenoprotein P, which transports selenium to tissues. In vitro, selenoprotein P pro- tects against peroxynitrite-induced damage and reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides.123

## Redox Regulation: The Glutathione System

<!-- chunk -->

## Glutathione (GSH)

GSH is a sulfhydryl-reducing agent containing cysteine that occurs in millimolar concentrations in most cells, where it acts as a detoxi- fying agent, assists amino acid transport, and quenches free radicals, in addition to regulating the internal redox environment of cells. Together with ascorbate, GSH participates in the regeneration of vita- min E, which emphasizes the intracellular cooperation of antioxidants. Reduced GSH reacts directly with singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radicals to form oxidized glutathione (GSSG).

<!-- chunk -->

## GSH Reductase

GSH reductase reduces GSSG with NADPH, linking thiol regulation to robust glucose metabolism. GSH reductase helps maintain a high GSH/ GSSG ratio. Oxidative stress reduces this ratio, activates transcription factors, and increases production of IL-1 and TNF.124 NADPH and GSH are cofactors for other reductases that help regenerate tocopherol and ascorbate, demonstrating the principle that overall metabolic bal- ance is a prerequisite for adequate antioxidant defense.

<!-- chunk -->

## GSH Transferase

GSH S-transferase adds GSH to endogenous and exogenous electro- philic compounds and is considered a component of Phase II detox- ification enzymes. Modified products are cleared from the cell with multidrug-resistance–associated proteins. This transferase also func- tions in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene C4 and D4. Like GSH peroxidases and Prxs, GSH S-transferase requires an ample supply of reduced GSH for optimal activity.

## GSH and Neuroprotection

With aging, there is a general decline in GSH levels, and low GSH levels are associated with a variety of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, age-related macular degeneration, gastrointestinal disorders, and neu- rodegenerative diseases.125 In the brain, GSH serves to detoxify xenobiotics and has an import- ant role in antioxidant defense and the regulation of intracellular redox status. This extends its reach to gene expression and cell differentiation in the brain. Dysregulation of glutathione homeostasis has been impli- cated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.126 In a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, the formation of mixed disulfide protein on brain and blood preceded amyloid plaque appear- ance.127 In a neuronal-like cell line, exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) revealed increased cytotoxicity, low- ered the GSH/GSS6 ratio, and increased β -amyloid production.128

## Redox Regulation: The Thioredoxin System

The thioredoxin system contains two components: thioredoxin (Trx) and Trx reductase. Trx is a small sulfhydryl protein that acts as a reduc- ing agent for Prxs and ribonucleotide reductase. Trx also promotes the activation of several transcription factors.129 Trx reductase is a sele- nocysteine-containing enzyme that specifically catalyzes the reduc- tion of Trx. Together, Trx and Trx reductase function as a widespread redox-regulating mechanism with multiple roles in intracellular sig- naling and resistance to oxidative stress. Thus thioredoxin activates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1. It reduces redox factor-1, which

then reduces oxidized (inactive) transcription factors such as NF- κ B and Nref-2.130 Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE-1), a dual-functional DNA repair enzyme that can also reduce transcription factors (such as AP-1 and p53), is regenerated by thioredoxin, linking DNA repair to the cellular redox balance.131

## Antioxidant Enzymes: Transactivation of Antioxidant

<!-- chunk -->

## Response Elements

Nuclear transcription factors such as Nfr2 can be regarded as a cell-sens- ing system for oxidative and electrophilic stress, which is responsive within 15 minutes after exposure to a stressor.132 Transactivation of AREs is regulated by the redox balance, in which nuclear factor Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus in response to ROS, where it activates genes responsible for a battery of antioxidant enzymes, including Prx-6, GPx, GSH transferase, and Trx, as well as Phase II detoxifying enzymes.133 The Nrf2–ARE pathway represents a master antioxidant mechanism especially relevant to diabetic dysfunction.134 Antioxidant enzyme levels tend to decrease with age-related con- ditions.135,136 Several antioxidant enzymes are often induced during the oxidative stress associated with age-related diseases. As an exam- ple, in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries, catalase, GSH perox- idase, and SOD were upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions, possibly as the result of oxidative stress.108 Upregulation of Trx1, Trx2, and TrxR2 can occur in aging skeletal muscle, although their role in redox-regulated adaptions to failed muscle functioning remains unclear.137

## Micronutrients as Antioxidants

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin C

Ascorbic acid can react with a wide range of ROS, including superox- ide, singlet oxygen, hypochlorite, and sulfur radicals.138 Ascorbic acid is an efficient chain-breaking antioxidant in human plasma,139 where it protects lipids and membranes by scavenging peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals.140 Vitamin C can reduce heavy-metal toxicity.141 In animal models, high levels of ascorbate compensated for low GSH production, and vice versa. A combination of ascorbate with vitamin E is possibly more effective than ascorbate alone for older adults.142 Ascorbic acid functions with GSH and lipoic acid to regenerate α -tocopherol. To recycle ascorbate, dehydroascorbate is reduced back to ascorbate via GSH and NADPH. The recommended dietary allowance (90 mg for men >19 years old; 75 mg for women >19 years old) is probably an underestimate. Healthy young women may require at least 400 mg/day of ascorbic acid, according to tissue-saturation studies.143

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Disease. Observational studies suggest that ascor-

bic acid has, at best, modest effects on the risk of coronary heart disease. Although a meta-analysis found no benefit with vitamin C supplementation on survival and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk,144 others reported benefits with high supplemental vitamin C.145 The Nurses’ Health Study suggested that vitamin C intake of more than 359 mg/day (diet plus supplements) reduced the risk of CVD.146 For diabetic postmenopausal women, high vitamin C supplementation correlated with an increased risk of CVD mortality.147 The Physicians’ II study found that vitamin C supplementation at 500 mg/day was not cardioprotective for middle-aged men.148 Another randomized con- trolled study (the MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study) did not find that vitamin C supplementation reduced the risk of CVD.149

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypertension. In young healthy women, a higher level of plasma

vitamin C was associated with decreased blood pressure.150 A meta-analysis of 29 short-term trials indicated that a median supple- mentation dose of 500 mg/day significantly reduced blood pressure in healthy and hypertensive adults.151

<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer. High ascorbic acid intake has been linked to a reduced

risk of cancers of the oral cavity and esophagus,152 ovaries,153 stom- ach,154 and colon. However, a pooled analysis of eight prospective studies found that vitamin C intake was unrelated to lung cancer.155 Treatment of male physicians aged equal to or more than 50 years with 500 mg ascorbic acid daily for 8 years found no reduced risk of prostate cancer or total cancer.156 Several studies suggested that extracellular ascorbate at millimolar concentrations (achieved via intravenous or intraperitoneal administration) can help increase survival rates.157 A plausible mechanism involves ascorbate reduction of transition metals (cupric to cuprous, ferric to ferrous), which react with oxygen, yielding superoxide and H 2 O 2 , to which tumor cells are susceptible.158

## Neurodegeneration. The brain possesses one of the highest ascor-

bic acid concentrations in the body. The Rotterdam Study suggested that a high intake of ascorbic acid and vitamin E was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, especially among cigarette smok- ers.159 Although the ascorbate levels in the plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 32 patients with Alzheimer’s disease did not correlate with cognitive decline over 1 year, the ratio of CSF ascorbate/plasma ascor- bate increased, which was possibly related to an impaired ability of the brain to concentrate neuroprotective nutrients.160 Supplementation of ascorbic acid was associated with a lower incidence of severe cog- nitive impairment among elderly volunteers.161 In an animal model, intraperitoneal injection of ascorbic acid prevented disruption of the blood–brain barrier, resulting in sustained somatosensory function.162

## Cataract. Although some investigations reported the risk of cata-

racts and retinal damage with lowered vitamin C status, a prospective study employing 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, and 15 mg of β -carotene found no effect on the development or progression of cataracts.163

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes. A 12-year prospective study of nondiabetic participants

in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk Study noted that those with the highest 20% of plasma vitamin C had a 62% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes com- pared with those in the lowest 20%.157 Another cross-sectional study noted an inverse relationship between the levels of ascorbic acid and hemoglobin A1c.164

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin C: A Cell Response Modifier? Generally, vitamin C appears

to function primarily as an antioxidant in modulating the redox bal- ance in a variety of situations, such as attenuating cytochrome P450 detoxification or plasma C-reactive protein levels. Vitamin C was able to increase the efficiency of generating mouse and human pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells, in part by attenuating cell senescence.165 In other research, the expression of five functional protein groups related to signaling, apoptosis, and activated transcription, among oth- ers, was detected in vitamin C–treated T cells.166 As an additional fac- tor relevant to neurodegenerative disorders, ascorbic acid can switch central nervous system (CNS) metabolism from glucose consumption over to lactate oxidation to maintain synaptic functioning.167

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin E (Tocopherols)

Vitamin E refers to four tocopherols ( α , β , γ , δ ) and tocotrienols ( α , β , γ , δ ) that possess an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain. Vitamin E rep- resents a primary chain-breaking antioxidant of lipids, lipoproteins, and membranes, where it acts as a peroxyl radical scavenger, creat- ing a tocopheryl radical. This radical will decompose unless converted back to tocopherol by ascorbic acid, GSH, and coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ), illustrating that antioxidant defenses complement one another.139,168 Vitamin E can exacerbate hypertension in susceptible people. High levels may antagonize other fat-soluble vitamins, thus decreasing bone mineralization. This vitamin may be contraindicated in patients receiving anticoagulants or in those with a vitamin K deficiency.

<!-- chunk -->

## 739CHAPTER 97 Naturally Occurring Antioxidants

Vitamin E supplements often incorporate synthetic α -tocopherol, a mixture of d and l isomers, but only the d form (RRR- α -tocopherol) is active in the body. Esterified α -tocopherol is considerably more sta- ble than unesterified tocopherol, and supplements often use esters of vitamin E, which are readily hydrolyzed and absorbed. As with other fat-soluble vitamins, supplementation is prudent in patients with mal- absorption syndromes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Immunity.

α -Tocopherol may increase the T-cell–mediated response, which is impaired with aging. Supplementing healthy elderly people (consuming an otherwise typical diet) with 60 to 800 mg vita- min E improved several aspects of cell-mediated immunity within to 12 months.169 Among older adults (mean age 70), supplementation with 200 mg/day of synthetic vitamin E for 3 months increased neutro- phil chemotaxis and proliferation, natural killer cell activity, and IL-2 production.170 An RCT of nursing home residents found that supple- mentation with 200 IU synthetic vitamin/day for 1 year reduced the risk of upper respiratory tract infections.171 In other research, ingestion of 268 mg/day of natural vitamin E for 8 months significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin-E, with apparent normalization of most lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis.172

## Cardiovascular Disease. Hypothetically, the oxidation of LDL-C

and other lipoproteins can initiate atherosclerosis. Increasing dietary vitamin E intake to more than 20 times the usual intake in a Western- type diet was suggested to reduce the risk of heart disease and its manifestations, such as myocardial infarction, among low-risk pop- ulations.173 However, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with α -tocopherol (200–800 IU/day) in Western populations have been mainly negative.174 Only 5 of 12 clinical studies on vitamin antioxidants and CVD reported reduced cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. These include the Cambridge Heart and Antioxidant Study (CHAOS), the Women’s Health Study (reduced risk of sudden death from CVD), and the Secondary Prevention With Antioxidants of CVD in End-Stage Renal Disease (SPACE) study of hemodialysis patients who were at high risk of oxidative stress. Inconsistent results with vitamin E may reflect compounding variables, including the heterogeneity of risk factors for coronary heart disease; treatment for the late course of disease versus treatment for early-onset oxidative stress175; and genotypic differences among subgroups, for example, the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype in patients with type 2 diabetes.176 Potentially harmful effects of supplemental vitamin E were reported in three of these (increased risks of stroke and heart failure). As is typical of reductionistic approaches to medicine, α -tocopherol is only one of eight tocopherols found in nature, with others, such as gamma and delta tocopherols, having many important health benefits beyond simply antioxidant activity. This is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.

## Neurodegenerative Disease. A high intake of vitamin E and vita-

min C was found to be associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease according to the Rotterdam study.159 A meta-analysis con- cluded that circulating vitamin E, C, and A were significantly reduced in patients with Alzheimer’s disease versus healthy individuals.177 In a controlled trial of patients with moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease, α -tocopherol administered at a daily level of 2000 IU delayed the onset of severe dementia or death in comparison with controls.178 However, a controlled clinical study of patients with mild cognitive impairment found that treatment with 2000 IU vitamin E failed to slow mental decline.179 A multicenter RCT found that supplementation with IU vitamin E daily for 2 years delayed the decline in daily function- ing, yet it failed to alter cognition according to standardized tests.180 Little evidence suggests that long-term supplementation with vitamin E alone improves cognition among healthy adults. More generally, it is unrealistic to expect that dosing with one or two antioxidants can substitute for multiple synergistic factors that support interlocking regulatory pathways in reducing risks of chronic degenerative disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer. Most clinical studies have not demonstrated the benefits

of vitamin E supplementation in reducing the risk of most cancers. Effects of antioxidant supplementation often depend on the subject’s nutritional status. Clinical studies with vitamin E illustrate this prin- ciple. The Shanghai Breast Cancer Study observed a 20% reduction in breast cancer risk with vitamin E supplementation among women with low dietary intake.181 The Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial, which included adults deficient in several micro- nutrients, examined the effects of 50 mcg/day of selenium, 30 mg/day of vitamin E, and 15 mg/day of β -carotene. Supplementation led to decreased all-cause mortality, including overall cancer risk.182 In con- trast, U.S. studies of vitamin E on cancer rates reported negative results for breast cancer,183 endometrial cancer,184 lung cancer (pooled anal- ysis of eight studies),185 and cancer incidence and cancer mortality.186 Although earlier studies suggested an inverse association between vitamin E intake and the risk of prostate cancer, the Physician’s Health Study II of men aged 50 years or older found no reduction in the risk of prostate cancer and other site-specific cancers or the risk of total cancer after synthetic vitamin E supplementation (400 IU daily for 8 years).187 Supplementation of men (ages >55 years) with vitamin E 400 IU per day for up to 12 years increased the risk of prostate cancer by 17%. Men who took vitamin E together with selenomethionine (200 mcg per day) had no higher risk than those taking a placebo.188 Unknown compounding variables in such studies include the uncertain status of vitamin D, ω -6 fatty acids, and γ -tocopherol, and male hormones in addition to possible polymorphisms for the α -tocopherol–associated protein.189

## Diabetes. Whether

α -tocopherol can benefit diabetes has not been established through large, well-controlled clinical studies. A meta-anal- ysis of 14 small RCTs of patients with type 2 diabetes found that vita- min E supplementation of 200 to 1000 IU/day for 6 to 27 weeks had no significant effects on glycemic control (assessed by fasting glucose and insulin levels and by hemoglobin A1c).190

<!-- chunk -->

## Gamma-Tocopherol. Although the typical U.S. diet supplies twice

as much γ -tocopherol as the α form or tocotrienols, α -tocopherol pre- dominates in the body, due to selection by liver tocopherol-transfer protein, which preferentially incorporates α -tocopherol into lipopro- teins. Gamma-tocopherol is also rapidly degraded. It selectively blocks reactive nitrogen species and complements antioxidant actions of α -to- copherol.191 Gamma-tocopherol can protect pancreatic β -cells against NO inhibition in vitro.192 Mice supplementation with a mixture of α - and γ -tocopherol (not α -tocopherol alone) reduced age-related tran- scriptional changes in the brain.193 Clinical findings using γ -tocopherol are limited. Patients with metabolic syndrome treated with γ -tocoph- erol 800 mg and α -tocopherol 800 mg/day for 6 weeks had significantly decreased markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (high-sensi- tivity C-reactive protein and nitrotyrosine) compared with placebo.194 The EPIC Study found no correlation between plasma levels of either α - or γ -tocopherol and the risk of prostate cancer.195 Cigarette smokers supplemented with γ -tocopherol experienced short-term benefits on vascular endothelial activity during smoking cessation.196

## Tocotrienols. Tissue distributions of tocotrienols and tocopherols

differ, which is perhaps indicative of selective mechanisms in various tissues.197 Tocotrienols can induce apoptosis in prostate cancer and breast cancer cells.198 Tocotrienols can suppress inflammatory mark- ers, such as IL-6, TNF- α , and NO, by stimulated macrophages.199 Clinical studies are in their infancy. Hypercholesterolemic subjects treated with mixtures of tocotrienols daily for 28 days did not have

improved serum lipid or glucose concentrations or lipid peroxidation (urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2a).200 In contrast, treatment of healthy adults with tocotrienols 160 mg/day for 6 months according to a ran- domized, double-blind protocol resulted in reduced DNA damage.201

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin E: A Cellular Response Modifier? Several studies suggest

that vitamin E administration can increase the expression of genes related to Th1/Th2 ratios in older mice.202 Alpha-tocopherol can block upregulation of NF- κ B, PKC, and p38 MAPK pathways to prevent inflammatory cytokine production in stimulated human monocytes and in human dendritic cells.203 The variation in cytokine responses to vitamin E in elderly populations seems to reflect polymorphisms in cytokine genes.204 Physiologically relevant concentrations of α -tocoph- erol were found to interfere with the cytotoxic and cytostatic actions of several protein kinase inhibitors, whereas other antioxidants did not affect the action of these inhibitors on cell-cycle arrest or cell death.205 Nonetheless, such observations reflect the altered redox state of cells and tissues. For example, vitamin E may protect membrane domains and polyunsaturated fatty acid pathways from ROS as its underlying mechanism of action, rather than its involvement in specific signaling actions.206

## Carotenoids

Carotenoids, plant pigments, are conveniently divided into carotenes and xanthophylls (oxygenated carotenes). The best-known carotenoid, β -carotene, represents only 25% to 33% of plasma carotenoids. In gen- eral, carotenoids are versatile antioxidants. Beta-carotene is especially effective at low oxygen tension, as found in tissues.207 Increased carot- enoid levels have been associated with decreased LDL-C oxidation.208 They can quench ROS produced during inflammation and modulate levels of proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes.209,210

<!-- chunk -->

## Lung Cancer. Although retrospective studies suggested an inverse

correlation, analysis of pooled results from six prospective cohort stud- ies found no relationship between dietary β -carotene and the reduc- tion of lung cancer risk.211 A systematic review of prospective studies concluded that dietary intake of total carotenoids did not significantly reduce the risk of lung cancer.212 Supplementation has been studied in large RCTs. The two studies (the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Trial [ATBC] and the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial [CARET]) reported an increased risk of lung cancer in high-risk groups supplemented with 30 mg β -carotene/day.213 In con- trast, the Physicians’ Health Study (only 11% smokers) found no effect with β -carotene supplements at a level of 50 mg every other day.214

<!-- chunk -->

## Prostate Cancer. A meta-analysis of 15 case-control studies showed

an inverse relationship between blood levels of lycopene and the risk of advanced-stage cancer. There was no risk association in nonaggressive disease.215 Dietary lycopene intake was not related to prostate cancer risk in a large prospective study.195 The question remains whether con- sumption of lycopene-rich foods can lower the risk of prostatic cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

## Breast Cancer. An inverse relationship between the consumption

of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and the risk of breast can- cer was found to be strongest among premenopausal women.216 For women who were smokers and did not use supplements, dietary α -car- otene and β -carotene intake was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer.217 Pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies reported a reduction in breast cancer risk with increased blood levels of total carotenoids, α -carotene, and lutein.218 In contrast, the Women’s Health Study found no link between lycopene intake and a reduced risk of breast cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Disease. Although several prospective studies

found that higher intake of carotenoid-rich foods correlated with reduced risk of CVD, others did not.145 Four RCTs found no effect of oral β -carotene, ranging from 20 to 50 mg/day, in preventing CVD.214 Thus, although diets rich in β -carotene are often linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, the benefits may derive from other constitu- ents in fruits and vegetables.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adult Macular Degeneration. The xanthophylls lutein and zeaxan-

thin are the only carotenoids in the retina and macula, where they filter blue light. Cross-sectional and retrospective case-control studies sug- gest that increased consumption of carotenoids, especially lutein and zeaxanthin, is linked with a lower risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD).219 Yet another study of more than 4000 sub- jects found no evidence that β -carotene supplementation prevented or delayed AMD with intermediate risk of adult macular degeneration or with advanced AMD in one eye when supplemented with lutein (10 mg/day) and zeaxanthin (2 mg/day) in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, β -carotene, and zinc according to the Eye Disease Study (AREDS-2) protocol.220 Supplementation did not slow the progression to advanced AMD. Research extending this study to various combi- nations of carotenoids suggests that lutein and zeaxanthin can reduce disease progression compared with β -carotene alone.

<!-- chunk -->

## Carotenoids: Cell Response Modifiers? The interpretation of the

effects of β -carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids is compli- cated by their potential formation of retinoids, which are well-known regulatory species. Although they are effective antioxidants, non–pro- vitamin A carotenoids (lycopene, lutein, canthaxanthin, and astaxan- thin) do not present this complication. Much of lycopene’s activity relates to its antioxidant actions; however, its metabolites could pro- vide regulatory effects.221 The nonprovitamin A carotenoids may affect cancer cells through increased apoptosis, decreased cell-cycle progres- sion, or decreased production of cytokines. Alternatively, lycopene’s inhibition of cancer cell proliferation may involve increased gap-junc- tion–mediated intercellular communication.222

## Coenzyme Q

## 10

<!-- chunk -->

## (Ubiquinone)

Ubiquinones contain side chains with isoprene units, and the predom- inant form in humans is ubiquinone 10 (CoQ 10 ). It functions as an essential electron carrier in mitochondrial ATP production. As the only lipophilic antioxidant synthesized in the body, CoQ 10 also stabi- lizes membranes, and it helps recycle α -tocopherol.223 Ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ 10 , protects LDL-C against lipid peroxidation.224 CoQ 10 synthesis requires vitamins B 2 , B 6 , B 12 , and folate, and synthesis may be suboptimal in people with a low intake of these micronutrients.

## Immunity. CoQ

10 may enhance the immune system. Supplementation of healthy volunteers with CoQ 10 was found to increase white blood cell levels and decrease lymphocyte DNA damage (3 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks).225

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Disease. In an RCT of patients at risk for CVD,

6-month treatment with a combination of vitamins C and E, CoQ 10 , and selenium increased arterial elasticity, lowered glycosylated hemoglobin, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with controls.226 CoQ 10 has been used with conventional therapy in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Studies employing doses ranging from 100 to 200 mg/day for up to 3 months reported minor improve- ments.227 Drugs such as β -blockers and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glu- taryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors lower serum levels of CoQ 10 .228 However, the necessity of CoQ 10 supplementation in these situations remains uncertain. A meta-analysis of 14 RCTs of various CoQ 10 pro- tocols suggests an improvement in exercise capacity, with a significant difference in left heart ejection as the end point.229 Conversely, an RCT of 420 patients with cardiac failure receiving standard therapy and mg of CoQ 10 daily for 2 years found that CoQ 10 significantly reduced major adverse cardiovascular events.230

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid

As a coenzyme of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α -ketoglutarate dehy- drogenase, α -lipoic acid (ALA) is required in the mitochondrial catab- olism of carbohydrates and fatty acids. ALA also scavenges hydroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, superoxide, and peroxyl radicals, and it can regenerate endogenous antioxidants, including ascorbic acid and GSH.

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes. A meta-analysis of four RCTs with intravenous ALA of

600 mg/day indicated a significant improvement in diabetic neuropa- thy.231 Whether oral ALA supplementation offers benefits is less clear. The highest tissue level of lipoic acid likely attainable from oral doses is less than 10% of other intracellular antioxidants such as GSH.232 The effect of lipoic acid supplementation on long-term glycemic control remains uncertain. For example, a controlled study of 72 patients with type 2 diabetes reported that oral supplementation with 600 mg ALA daily for 4 weeks improved insulin sensitivity by 25%.233

<!-- chunk -->

## Aging and Neurological Disease. Animal studies suggest that high-

dose ALA and/or acetyl-l-carnitine can improve brain function,234 reduce brain lipid peroxidation, and increase brain antioxidant enzyme activities in the brains of aged rats,235 especially in the hippocampus.236 Aged mice supplemented orally with ALA had increased glucose toler- ance, energy expenditure, and skeletal muscle mitochondria biogene- sis, but they also had increased loss of lean body mass.237 It is not clear that these results can be extrapolated clinically. Patients with varying stages of Alzheimer’s disease administered 600 mg/day of ALA for months showed slowed disease progression in patients with mild, not moderate, dementia.238

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Disease. ALA supplementation was used in mouse

models of ischemia-reperfusion and atherosclerosis, where it slowed the formation of atherosclerotic lesions.239 In a rat model of diabetes, intraperitoneal ALA reduced cardiac apoptosis and caspase expression and enhanced MnSOD activity and GSH levels.240 Feeding high-dose ALA reduced myocardial oxidant production to levels observed in healthy young rats.241 Limited research has focused on the question of oral administration of ALA to improve vascular function in dia- betes. As an example, supplementation of patients with diabetic neu- ropathy with 300 mg ALA/day for 4 weeks improved flow-mediated vasodilation.242

<!-- chunk -->

## Obesity. Preliminary data for metabolic syndrome are suggestive. A

study of 1127 of obese and preobese subjects supplemented for 4 months with ALA 800 mg/day reported a significant reduction in weight, blood pressure, body mass index, and abdominal circumference.243

<!-- chunk -->

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid: A Cell Response Modifier? ALA can induce

several Phase II antioxidant and thiol-protective enzymes, including enzymes needed for GSH synthesis. Old rats treated with ALA intra- peritoneally were found to have increased γ -glutamylcysteine ligase (GGL) activity, reflecting induced Nrf2 binding to ARE and increased transcriptional levels of GGL subunits, thus reversing the age-related losses.244 ALA activated protein kinase B (Akt), increasing the survival of cultured neuronal cells exposed to oxidative stress.245

# N-ACETYLCYSTEINE AND GLUTATHIONE

As a supplement, N-acetylcysteine is an effective precursor for GSH. GSH synthesis is regulated in part by cysteine availability. It is deacetylated in the gut to free cysteine, and oral supplementation can efficiently raise intracellular GSH246 in model systems and in healthy individuals.247 N-acetylcysteine may play a supportive role in improv- ing GSH status and maintaining cell redox balance, countering ROS, and attenuating drug toxicity as a conjugating agent in drug metabo- lism.248 Orally administered GSH may increase intestinal GSH levels via a GSH transport system.249

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxidative Stress. Supplementation of healthy, trained men with

N-acetylcysteine (1800 mg/day for 3 days before exhaustive resistance exercise) significantly increased plasma thiols and TAC and reduced lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation.250 An RCT of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes reported that 6-month treatment with N-acetylcysteine and arginine significantly reduced systolic blood pres- sure and lowered levels of oxidized LDL-C, C-reactive protein, VCAM- 1, and protein oxidation (plasma nitrotyrosine), suggesting improved endothelial function, along with reduced oxidative stress.251 To examine the role of glutathione and Nrf2-dependent detoxi- fication in age-related sensitivity to redox cycling, hepatocytes from young and old mice were studied. Exposure to xenobiotic insult led to a marked decline in GPx4 and GSH and a concomitant increase in lipid peroxidation. These differences were accentuated in hepatocytes from old mice. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine reduced cell death by more than twofold. These results suggest that N-acetylcysteine might help maintain glutathione levels and attenuate age-related decline in Nrf2–GSH dependent detoxification.252

## Magnesium

As a cofactor for nearly all ATP-requiring reactions, magnesium is integral to intermediary metabolism. Low magnesium status is linked to inflammation and activation of the systemic stress response. Subclinical magnesium deficiency is common in the United States, and magnesium deficiency is correlated with chronic diseases associated with aging.253 In rodents, low magnesium status caused the release of substance P, leading to increased circulating inflammatory cells, cytokines, and ROS, with depletion of antioxidants associated with cardiomyopa- thy.254 Furthermore, magnesium deficiency promoted senescence in primary human fibroblasts.255 Experimental magnesium deficiency created systemic inflammation with leukocyte and macrophage acti- vation, inflammatory cytokine release, the formation of acute-phase proteins, and oxidative stress. A study of young male athletes and sedentary controls suggested that supplementation with 500 mg mag- nesium daily for 28 days reduced DNA oxidation in peripheral blood lymphocytes.256 Possible mechanisms include opening calcium chan- nels and activation of NF- κ B.257 High fructose intake, for example, from excessive consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, coupled with low magnesium status could set the stage for oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in susceptible individuals.258 A meta-analysis concluded that dietary magnesium intake is inversely related to the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.259

# ZINC

Beyond its role in SOD, zinc is required by many transcription factors, including tumor-suppression protein p53. “Zinc fingers”—domains that bind multiple zinc atoms—stabilize these proteins. In addition to stabilizing membranes, zinc is involved in apoptosis, hormone release, and nerve transmission.260 Given the high prevalence of zinc deficiency, subclinical zinc deficiency manifests as inflammation and oxidative stress, and it often accompanies aging.261 That zinc deficiency diminishes immune function, especially Th1 activity, is well estab- lished. Zinc is essential for IL-2–mediated T-cell activation. The mech- anism seems to rely on the activation of NF- κ B signaling, resulting in increased expression of cytokines as TNF- α , IL-1B, IL-2, and IL-6.262 The ability of zinc supplementation to influence cytokine production is consistently reported. However, attenuation or potentiation seems to be dose dependent. Thus daily supplementation with 45 mg or more

zinc may decrease in vivo–generated proinflammatory cytokine pro- duction in stimulated mononuclear cells.263 Reduced cytokine produc- tion and T-cell activation was reported for elderly men and women supplemented with less than 20 mg zinc/day.264

## -Carnitine

l-Carnitine is synthesized mainly by the liver and kidney, then trans- ported to tissues using fatty acids and carbohydrate as fuel. Fatty acid transport into mitochondria relies on a carnitine shuttle for β -oxi- dation. A decline in carnitine correlates with the age-related decline in mitochondrial energy production and increased ROS.265 After demonstrations that supplementation with acetyl-l-carnitine reversed age-related decline in tissue carnitine levels in rats, later experiments showed that animals supplemented with high doses of ALA and ace- tyl-l-carnitine for 1 month exhibited improved substrate binding of brain carnitine acetyltransferase,234,266 improved memory,267 and decreased DNA damage.268 Whether such improvements with high doses of acetyl-l-carnitine translate into long-term benefits in prevent- ing age-related declines in memory and energy for patients remains to be investigated. Supplementation with 1000 mg/day for 12 weeks in patients with coronary artery disease increased HDL-C and Apo-A1 levels.269 In a related study, this protocol led to reduced lipid perox- idation and increased levels of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and GPx), suggesting a potential increase in antioxidant defenses with N-acetyl-carnitine supplements.270

# URIC ACID (URATE)

Uric acid is a waste product of purine metabolism that occurs in high levels in plasma. Urate is a broad-spectrum antioxidant capable of scav- enging free radicals, and it can chelate transition metals.271 Uric acid is responsible for 21% to 34% of the total plasma antioxidant activity, in which it appears to protect α -tocopherol from peroxyl radicals.272 Also, assays of TAC indicated that 49% of the TAC of human plasma is due to uric acid.273 Although a ubiquitous antioxidant, elevated urate is not necessarily beneficial.

# MELATONIN: A HORMONE WITH ANTIOXIDANT

# POTENTIAL

In addition to helping set the circadian rhythm and sleep patterns, melatonin acts as an antioxidant in vitro and in vivo.274 In senes- cence-accelerated mice, long-term administration of physiological levels of melatonin corrected hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, sug- gesting that melatonin may reduce the oxidative damage associated with aging.275 Melatonin can act by inhibiting the expression of eNOS in laboratory animals.276 It can also upregulate SOD and catalase in the brain and liver of rats exposed to carcinogens.277 In an experimental model of diabetes, melatonin was shown to reduce lipid peroxidation and upregulate GSH reductase, GPx, and γ -glutamylcysteine synthe- tase.278 As applied to oxidative stress in obesity, melatonin may play a role in benefiting calorie-restricted diets. In a small study, patients were supplemented with 10 mg melatonin daily or placebo for days. After melatonin supplementation, levels of adiponectin and GPx increased, whereas lipid peroxidation was decreased. Furthermore, melatonin facilitated weight loss.279 In keeping with its putative role as an anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin has a protective effect in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which responds to environ- mental agents, including pathogens, as well as to endogenous danger signals such as mitochondria-derived ROS.280

# NONNUTRITIVE ANTIOXIDANTS

## Polyphenols

Phytochemical antioxidants include polyphenols, which are composed of phenolic units. They are classified according to the number of ring structures as flavonoids, stilbenes, lignans, and phenolic acids. The persistent interest in polyphenols is due to their probable contribution to the health benefits of fruit- and vegetable-rich diets.

# FLAVONOIDS

Flavonoids (bioflavonoids) represent one of the largest classes of poly- phenols, and more than 5000 different flavonoids have been identi- fied. They fall into 12 major subclasses, differing according to their antioxidant properties, physiological activities, and bioavailability.281

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Patterns. For typical Western diets, the estimated daily

consumption of total flavonoids is in the range of 100 to 200 mg,282 although intake reflects cultural and even regional preferences. As examples, simple phenolic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, and coumaric acids) accounted for 75% of total phenolic intake among Finnish adults, whereas flavonoids accounted for 24% of the total.283 In an adult Spanish population, the mean intake of total flavonoids was shown to be 313 mg/day, with proanthocyanidins accounting for 60% of the total.284

<!-- chunk -->

## Flavonoid Bioavailability/Biotransformation. The uptake of indi-

vidual flavonoids including polymers such as proanthocyanidins is generally quite limited. Most flavonoids have very low water solubility. Phosphatidylcholine complexes of flavonoids may improve uptake.285 Absorbed aglycone flavonoids are often conjugated (sulfates, glucu- ronides) or methylated by intestinal and liver systems, then excreted. Such flavonoid derivatives may have different biological effects than parent compounds. Additionally, colonic bacteria can degrade poly- phenols by ring session, and absorbed monophenols often act differ- ently than parent compounds. Enterohepatic and enteric recycling of flavonoid metabolites is another complication.286 Analysis of the plasma and urine of healthy volunteers 2 hours after ingesting 200 mg of quercetin or green tea flavonoids failed to detect increases in any of 71 aromatic metabolites observable at 5 hours after ingestion, sug- gesting that flavonoid metabolites may not be responsible for rapid responses to ingested flavonoid-rich foods or beverages.287

<!-- chunk -->

## Direct Antioxidant Activity. In vitro, various flavonoids scavenge

a variety of radicals288,289 and block LDL-C oxidation.290 As chelators, flavonoids can inhibit spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radicals291 catalyzed by copper and iron ions. Although data are conflicting, it appears that flavonoids and their derivatives probably make small contributions as direct antioxidants in vivo.292 The observed increased antioxidant capacity in plasma after ingestion of fruits, fruit juice, and flavonoid-rich foods may be due to increased production of the anti- oxidant uric acid rather than due to flavonoids.293,294 Peak plasma con- centrations of flavonoids and their metabolites after acute ingestion are often less than μ mol/L, several orders of magnitude lower than plasma or intracellular concentrations of ascorbic acid, uric acid, and GSH.295

## Effects on Cell-Signaling Pathways. Results of cell-culture stud-

ies and animal testing indicate that antiinflammation, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and anticancer activities depend on modification of cell-signaling pathways. As examples, potential targets include the protein kinase/protein phosphatase families that ultimately regulate transcription factors. Additionally, flavonoids can alter growth-factor signaling by preventing receptor binding.

activities. Therefore it is difficult to generalize the activities of spe- cific flavonoids. Evidence for a relationship between flavonoids and cancer incidence is conflicting. Among healthy postmenopausal women, there was an inverse association between the incidence of lung cancer and the intake of flavanones and proanthocyanidins for current or past smokers—those with the highest intake of quercetin had a lower incidence of lung cancer—and in men, those with the highest intake of myricetin had a reduced risk of prostate cancer.296 In contrast, among elderly Dutchmen, dietary catechins mainly from tea were not associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer or epithelial cancers.297 In earlier studies, flavonoid consumption was not associated with reduced cancer risk in this population,298 although it was inversely related to mortality due to coronary heart disease (CHD).299 Flavonoids can reduce inflammation by blocking the expression of inflammatory mediators. Screening flavonoid, flavonoid metabolites, and combinations of flavonoids plus metabolites according to their ability to inhibit induction of TNF- α by isolated human monocytes revealed that combinations of flavonoid metabolites can be more effective than individual flavonoids or individual metabolites used sin- gly.300 Using a coculture system of intestinal epithelial and endothelial cells, researchers demonstrated that cyanidin-o-glucoside, one of the most common flavonoids, inhibited inflammation signaling, including selective inhibition of the NF- κ B pathway.301

## Flavonoids in Cardiovascular Protection. Variable results have

been obtained from studies of dietary flavonoids and antioxidants in medicinal plants and the risk of chronic disease, such as cardiovas- cular disease.302 Whether increased consumption of flavonoid-rich foods can reduce the risk of CVD is not clear. For example, a study of postmenopausal American women found significant reductions in the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality with increased flavonoid intake.303 Results of the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort suggested an inverse relationship between total dietary flavonoid intake and the risk of stroke and total CVD, especially for men.304 In contrast, a study of U.S. women reported no significant relationship between consumption of flavanols and flavones and CHD.305 There was no strong relationship between flavonoid intake and total CHD among American male health professionals.306 Caution is needed in interpret- ing these prospective studies due to omissions, such as the failure to (1) include all flavonoid subclasses, (2) calculate flavonoid intake based on more complete databases for flavonoid content of foods, and (3) make adjustments for the overall quality of diets. Other dietary factors besides flavonoids (vitamins, fiber, other phytochemicals) con- tribute to potential bias.

## Specific Antioxidant Mechanisms for Polyphenols in Vivo?

Interpretation of polyphenolic “antioxidant effects” is complicated by several factors. Most data regarding polyphenol activities come from cultured cells and tissues and often test concentrations of individual flavonoids that far exceed those found in vivo. Flavonoids such as quercetin and green tea catechins rapidly produce H 2 O 2 as an artifact under typical cell-culture conditions, thereby complicating interpreta- tion. The identity of the polyphenolic species affecting cells and tissues is uncertain due to their biotransformation. Localized concentrations of active species in vivo are also uncertain. Depending on the experimental design, polyphenols can inhibit COX, lipooxygenase, telomerase, xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450, and protein glycation, as well as modulate drug transport systems and platelet function. Flavonoids may influence multiple signaling path- ways, making it difficult to assign specific actions. As an example, red wine polyphenols administered to rats for 16 weeks inhibited chem- ically induced colon cancer.307 In the process, responses to oxidative stress were downregulated. Microarray analysis of cellular changes after polyphenol treatment for 14 days revealed the following frequencies of downregulated genes: receptors and signal transduction, 22%; trans- port and binding proteins, 14%; inflammatory and immune response, 11%; metabolic enzymes, 4%; gene expression/control, 4%; xenobiotic metabolism, 3%; and cell-cycle regulation, 3%. In the final analysis, the observed protective effects of flavonoid-rich foods in humans may be independent of flavonoids.

## Gastrointestinal Tract as Primary Target for Polyphenols? The

gastrointestinal (GI) tract is continuously exposed to ROS and RNS from multiple sources. The gut epithelium may not adapt to long- term oxidative stress, and because of low initial levels of defensive enzymes, it may be susceptible to oxidative damage with even moder- ate inflammation.308 After ingestion of flavonoid-rich foods, phenolic compounds are present in the stomach and intestinal lumen at much higher concentrations than those found in plasma.309 Of particular interest are inflammatory bowel disease, gastric ulcers, and liver dis- ease.310,311 ROS are present at high levels in the colons of patients with ulcerative colitis.312 Green tea polyphenols can reduce inflammation in models of inflammatory bowel disease.313 Polyphenolic by-products of intestinal metabolism, such as hydroxybenzoic acid and protocatechuic acid, exhibit important properties. As an example, they can induce apoptosis in gastric can- cer cells.314 Bioactive metabolites from dietary polyphenols can affect both the commensal gut microbiome and the host immune system. Animal studies implicate direct interaction with the gut epithelium as a prerequisite. In a rodent model of chemically induced colitis, oral administration of apple polyphenols downregulated intracellular signal cascades in the gut epithelium and infiltrated neutrophils.315 This effect was not observed with polyphenols during peritoneal administration.

## Cardiovascular Disease. Some epidemiological studies correlated

soy, especially soy protein, with a reduced risk of CHD.318 Several RCTs reported cardiovascular benefits with improved systemic arterial function after a meal enriched with soy isoflavones.319 In an RCT, sup- plementation of postmenopausal women with genistein for up to months decreased homocysteine and fasting glucose.320 However, the results were inconsistent.

## Cancer. A meta-analysis of soy isoflavone consumption and risk of

breast cancer observed a protective effect only among studies of Asian populations.321 This analysis failed to find a dose–response relation- ship between total isoflavone consumption and breast cancer inci- dence. Interventional studies using high doses of soy isoflavones have found altered breast fluid, a predictor of breast cancer risk.322 Soy isoflavones can suppress tumors in animal models. Genistein can induce apoptosis via downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, anti- apoptotic proteins in human hepatoma cell lines, as well as in breast, prostate, pancreatic, and non–small-cell lung cancer cells.323 Genistein also inhibits activation of the NF- κ B and Akt signaling pathways that normally balance cell survival and apoptosis.324 A meta-analysis sug- gested a significant association between the consumption of soy-based foods and a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer.325 Nonetheless, epidemiological studies on the relationship between a reduced risk of breast cancer and soy intake have yet to provide definitive evidence for taking soy supplements.

# BERRIES

Berries, currants, grapes, and certain tropical fruits and vegetables contain high levels of polyphenols, including flavanols, flavan-3-ols, tannins, and hydroxycinnamates and anthocyanins. Cyanidin-3- glucoside is the most prevalent anthocyanidin. Cell-culture studies, animal models, and limited clinical trials suggest anthocyanins may help prevent age-related deterioration and disease, including CVD and neurological disease.326

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Disease. Small-scale RCTs suggest that short-

term consumption of blueberries, strawberries, cranberries, and other berries can improve several cardiovascular parameters, such as blood pressure, endothelial function, and serum lipids. A review of clinical trials using grape juice found an inverse relationship between dose and flow-mediated dilation.327 In another study, healthy volunteers (50–70 years) consumed a mixed-berry beverage (blueberries, black- currant, elderberry, lingonberries, strawberries, and tomatoes [total polyphenols = 295 mg]) or control (polyphenol-free) beverage daily for 5 weeks. The berry intervention significantly reduced LDL-C and blood glucose levels compared with controls. Test subjects with the berry beverage also performed better on a test of working memory.328 Wine contains abundant polyphenols, and drinking red wine can increase the antioxidant capacity of serum.329,330 A meta-analysis of 133 RCTs studying the effects of flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods suggests that red wine consumption did not improve flow-mediated dilation, alter blood pressure, or change LDL-C levels.318 Results for grape juice consumption have also been mixed. Overweight volunteers who consumed 480 mL/day of grape juice for 12 weeks did not have improved plasma antioxidant capacity or lipid profiles.331

## Cancer. Black raspberries inhibited induced esophageal carcino-

genesis in a rodent model, apparently by suppressing oxidative stress via NF- κ B/MAPK signaling.332 Analysis of the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found no association between the risk of colorectal cancer and consumption of flavonoid classes in tea, blueberries, and oranges.333 Another meta-analysis found no significant association between high flavonoid consumption and the risk of lung cancer.334

## Diabetes. Several intervention studies suggest beneficial effects of

berries and fruits for patients with diabetes as well as for at-risk indi- viduals. As an example, an 8-week RCT found that treating healthy obese or overweight volunteers with 2 g grape polyphenols daily for 8 weeks prevented a fructose-induced increase in oxidative stress and insulin resistance.335 Patients with diabetes supplemented with cherry extracts providing 600 mg anthocyanins/day for 6 weeks experienced reduced levels of HbA1c and triglycerides.336 Compared with placebo, ingestion of mg anthocyanins daily for 24 weeks improved lipid profiles, decreased markers of oxidative stress, and improved TAC while reducing insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes.337

## Neurodegeneration. Regular consumption of berries may help

preserve cognitive health during aging. Analysis of the Nurses’ Health Study concluded that a high intake of blueberries and strawberries could delay cognitive aging by approximately 2.5 years.338 Furthermore, increased consumption of total flavonoids as well as anthocyanidins correlated with reduced rates of cognitive decline. Flavonoids may promote neurogenesis and synaptic growth for memory-related regions such as the hippocampus, via increased production of neurotrophins.339 As antioxidants, they may provide protection for inflammatory mediators due to activated microglia or hypertrophic astrocytes. Additionally, flavonoids can increase NO pro- duction to augment cerebral blood flow. Blueberries have been implicated in the preservation of cognition and brain health. Anthocyanins or their metabolites seem to cross the blood–brain barrier. Supplementation of rodents with blueberry prepa- rations reduced NF- κ B (indicator of oxidative stress), augmented the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) response element-binding protein (central to neuronal growth and maintenance), and increased the production of brain-derived nerve factor, all of which correlated with enhanced memory.340 An RCT indicated that blueberry sup- plementation can activate blood oxygen-dependent signaling in spe- cific brain regions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.341 Clinical trials with berries and anthocyanins are limited, and carefully designed studies of larger groups are needed.

# COCOA

Cocoa is a source of flavan-3-ols, especially (-)–epicatechin and pro- cyanidins. Their relationship to oxidative stress and TNF- α –mediated signaling have been studied.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cardiovascular Disease. Cocoa consumption is linked to a reduced

incidence of CVD in the elderly population, and it is associated with increased peripheral blood flow.342 Overweight adults who ingested cocoa beverages experienced significantly improved flow-mediated dilation in a randomized trial.343 Furthermore, administration of g/day cocoa powder for 4 weeks significantly reduced ICAM-1 and P-selectin in high-risk patients with CVD.344 An RCT of healthy male adults observed short-term benefits of cocoa-flavored consumption, as assessed by increased HDL-C, lower LDL-C, and reduced blood pressure.345 A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs found that consumption of cocoa beverages and chocolate bars for up to 18 months significantly increased flow-mediated dilation.346 In terms of mechanisms, (-)–epicatechin elevates NO in endothe- lial cells via inhibitors of NADPH-oxidase. Among human cohorts, cocoa and cocoa flavonols reduced markers of inflammation, includ- ing decreased IL-1B, VCAM-1, IL-10, and ICAM, in hypertensive adults.347

<!-- chunk -->

## Neuroprotection. Cocoa flavonoids have been associated with cog-

nitive improvements in healthy elderly adults. The Cocoa, Cognition and Aging Study examined this question in detail. Older adults con- suming an intermediate dosage of cocoa flavanols (520 mg/day) or a high dosage (993 mg/day) for 8 weeks showed improved cognitive function.348 Nonetheless, negative results on cognition from cocoa supplementation have also been reported. Possible mechanisms include improved glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, improve- ments in endothelial function, and improved cerebral blood flow.349

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes. Results of epidemiological studies of dietary intake

of flavanols from various sources have been inconsistent. Even so, a meta-analysis of RCTs concluded that moderate consumption of choc- olate (up to 6 servings/week) is associated with reduced risk of CVD, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.350 As an example of an intervention trial, daily consumption of 100 g of dark chocolate bars (147 mg catechins/ day) improved insulin sensitivity and reduced blood pressure in glu- cose-intolerant hypertensive patients.351 Cell-culture studies to define the antidiabetic mechanisms of flavonoids can improve redox states and increase GPx and Gr via Nfr2 signaling, yielding increased reduc- tions in GSH.

# TEA

The health benefits of tea are likely related to polyphenolic content. The total flavonoid content in green tea and black tea is 138 mg and 118 mg per 100 mL, respectively. Flavanol-3-ols (catechins) are a major class of

<!-- chunk -->

## 745CHAPTER 97 Naturally Occurring Antioxidants

tea flavonoids, represented by epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3 gal- late (EGCG), epicatechin-3 gallate (ECG), and (-)–epicatechin (EC). Tea flavonoids comprise 30% to 40% by weight in brewed tea extract. Increased consumption of flavon-3-ols in U.S. adults correlated with reduced proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, although tea consumption per se did not correlate with a composite inflammation score.352 Theaflavins are additional derivatives found in black tea. They are formed from green tea catechins by oxidation and fermentation. These condensation products are poorly absorbed; consequently, sys- temic effects probably reflect the actions of microbial metabolites.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cancer. Tea flavonoids may block signal transduction pathways

and induce apoptosis in various tumor cells, including skin, prostate, colon, breast, and lung. EGCG blocked the growth of human cervical cancer cells via cell-cycle arrest and induced apoptosis.517 It did so by inhibiting tyrosine kinases, thus blocking MAPK signaling pathways and NF- κ B and AP-1.518 Green tea catechins can limit DNA oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and free radical production in smokers.519 Analysis of nearly 200 epidemiological studies examined associa- tions between green tea consumption and risks of cancer at different sites and found that the majority of reports did not show a preven- tive effect. Inhibition with green tea consumption was more frequent among Asian populations, according to case-control studies.353,354 However, tea consumption may help specific subgroups, such as lowering the risk of breast cancer only among women with low cate- chol-O-methyl transferase.355 Intervention studies are a more effective way to establish the pro- tective effects of tea on cancer risk. In a double-blind study, patients at risk for prostate cancer treated with green tea catechins 600 mg/day for 1 year had a cancer rate of 3% compared with a 30% rate for the placebo group.356 A prospective study of patients after resection for colon cancer or polypectomy employed a daily dose of EGCG 20 mg and apigenin 20 mg for up to 4 years. The recurrence rate of neoplasia was 7% for treated patients versus 47% for untreated patients.357

## Cardiovascular disease. In apolipoprotein-E gene knockout mice,

an animal model of atherosclerosis, theaflavin with quercetin reduced the formation of atherosclerotic lesions and vascular superoxide and ILB-4 while increasing vascular endothelial NOS activity, NO pro- duction, and vasodilation.358 A meta-analysis of seven cohort and case-control studies reported an 11% decrease in the risk of myocar- dial infarction with daily consumption of three cups of tea.359 A later meta-analysis of nine observational studies suggested that consump- tion of the equivalent of three cups of green or black tea daily was asso- ciated with a significantly reduced risk of ischemic stroke.360

## Diabetes. A meta-analysis of RCTs regarding the possible health

effects of green tea paints a conflicting picture. Analysis of seven trials with patients with diabetes and prediabetes found no effect of green tea or green tea extracts on fasting blood glucose and insulin levels or on glycemic control (as glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c, or insulin sensi- tivity).361 Another meta-analysis found that green tea extract given to individuals with prediabetes, individuals with diabetes, or overweight individuals for 4 to 6 weeks improved fasting glucose and HbA1c lev- els, especially with high doses of catechins.362

## Pine Bark Extract

Pine bark extract (PBE) represents a complex mixture of polyphenols enriched in procyanidolic oligomers (PCOs), containing two to seven monomers of catechin and epicatechin. PCOs are effective antioxidants in vitro and can protect and/or regenerate α -tocopherol and vitamin C. PBE can upregulate antioxidative enzymes in cultured cells363 and also protect rodents against hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress.364

<!-- chunk -->

## Inflammation. PBE can inhibit the production of ROS by macro-

phages blocking the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 β .365 Plasma from subjects treated with PBE can block NF- κ B activation and the production of matrix metalloproteinases in human monocytes.366 Rodents fed diets supplemented with PBE had increased plasma antioxidant capacity and reduced lipid peroxidation (thiobar- bituric acid reactive substances).367 Plasma taken from healthy subjects 30 minutes after ingestion of a single dose of 300 mg of PBE had inhib- ited COX-1 and COX-2 in human monocytes.368 These observations suggest that PCOs may be useful in reducing inflammation; standard- ized PBE has been used to treat capillary dysfunction in patients with diabetes, venous abnormalities,369 and knee osteoarthritis.370 As an example, the San Valentino Osteoarthritis Study found that a stan- dardized PBE (Pycnogenol) reduced pain and stiffness and improved the flexibility of osteoarthritic joints.371

# GRAPE SEED EXTRACT

Wine flavonoids including PCOs are effective antioxidants in vitro. They can reduce lipid peroxides and decrease the susceptibility of iso- lated LDL-C to oxidation. Grape seed extract (GSE) has been employed as a source of monomeric and oligomeric favon-3-ols.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxidative Stress. GSE treatment led to a significant postprandial

reduction in plasma lipid hydroperoxides and increased antioxidant capacity in healthy volunteers.372 Male smokers administered GSE had significantly decreased platelet reactivity compared with control sub- jects given a placebo.373 Healthy volunteers consuming 430 mg GSE showed a 33% improvement in redox states 24 hours after ingestion.374

<!-- chunk -->

## Diabetes. Several studies suggest that GSE may benefit patients

with diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes received GSE 600 mg/ day according to a controlled double-blind protocol. After 4 weeks, significant decreases were observed for plasma fructosamine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and significant increases were seen for whole-blood GSH compared with placebo.375 A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs concluded that GSE is associated with beneficial effects on blood pressure, especially in obese subjects and patients with metabolic disorders.376

## Neurological Disease. Animal experiments indicate that GSE can

limit lipid peroxidation in the brain.377 GSE polyphenols have been shown to inhibit protofibril formation and protofiber oligomerization in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.378

## Chemoprevention. GSE can inhibit the proliferation of a variety of

cancer cell lines involving regulatory targets, such as MAPKs, NF- κ B, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases), and inhibit angiogene- sis.379 Furthermore, pretreatment with GSE protected rodents against experimentally induced hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and doxo- rubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing oxidative stress.377,380

## Oxidative Stress. In part, the beneficial effects appear to be related

to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, and it is likely that active constituents, ginkgolides, and related flavonoids reduce oxi- dative stress.381,382 Cell-culture studies suggest that EGb 761 can raise GSH levels and induce γ -glutamylcysteinyl synthetase, the rate-limit- ing enzyme in GSH synthesis.383 Damage to human endothelial cells

exposed to oxidized LDL-C could be prevented by EGb 761.384 Rats treated with EGb 761 had increased catalase and SOD activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus, striatum, and sub- stantia nigra compared with controls.385

## Aging and Dementia. Mice supplemented with EGb 761 also had

less ROS-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes than untreated mice; this result was greater in old mice than in young animals.386 In clin- ical studies, patients with type 2 diabetes treated with EGb 761 for months were found to have reduced markers of lipid peroxidation in platelets, possibly via inhibition of the COX-1–mediated cascade.387 Large randomized trials (the GEM Study and the Guid Age Study) found no benefits of EGb 761 supplementation for age-related cog- nitive decline.388,389 A recent RCT of patients with vascular cognitive impairment found that EGb 761 treatment for 6 months slowed cogni- tive deterioration in only one of four neuropsychological tests.390

# SILYMARIN

Silymarin, a flavonoid concentrate from milk thistle, and silibinin, a principal constituent of silymarin, can scavenge ROS and decrease inflammation.

## Hepatoprotection. Silymarin reduced oxidative stress and pre-

vented liver necrosis in mice exposed to toxic agents.391 Silymarin blocked the production of TNF- α , interferon- γ , and IL-2 by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells isolated from hepatitis C virus–infected and noninfected subjects.295 Phase I to II trials of sily- marin treatment have not demonstrated a consistent reduction in liver function tests and viral load or improved liver histology in patients with hepatitis C,392 a conclusion supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis.393 Another meta-analysis of silymarin in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease found a significant reduction in only a single marker of liver status (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase).394

## Diabetes. An open trial with patients with cirrhotic diabetes

treated with 600 mg/day silymarin for 12 months reported a signifi- cant reduction in glucosuria, glycosylated hemoglobin, and malond- ialdehyde levels compared with controls.395 Similar positive results were found in an RCT of treatment of patients with type 2 diabe- tes with 600 mg/day silymarin for 4 months.396 A meta-analysis of RCTs found that silymarin administration can lead to a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c levels but not in lipid profiles.397

## Cancer. Androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells can be inhib-

that flavonoids, such as quercetin, can inhibit COX-2 and 5-lipoxy- genase pathways to curtail production of inflammatory eicosanoids.399 Flavonoids may reduce the expression of adhesion molecules needed to recruit white blood cells to arterial walls, a property unrelated to their antioxidant potential. Quercetin and kaempferol inhibited adhesion molecule expression induced by TNF- α in human aortic endothelial cells.400 Preexposure of hepatocytes to flavonoids blocked this inhibi- tory effect, suggesting that liver biotransformation reduces the ability of flavonoids to influence endothelial cells. Quercetin supplementation of healthy volunteers with quercetin (500 or 1000 mg) together with vitamin C (125 or 250 mg) daily over 12 weeks significantly increased plasma quercetin without changing plasma oxidant capacity (FRAP and ORAC).401

## Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress. Stress induced by strenuous

exercise increased plasma cortisone and lipid peroxides and decreased SOD, GPx, and brain catalase in rats. Treatment with quercetin signifi- cantly increased these activities while lowering plasma peroxides.402 In contrast, long-term quercetin supplementation (1000 mg/day) in ath- letes did not protect against exercise-induced oxidative stress, although supplementation led to a modest improvement in maximal oxygen uptake in untrained individuals.369,403

## Cardiovascular Disease. The Zutphen study reported an inverse

relationship between the incidence of stroke and CAD and the con- sumption of flavonoids, particularly quercetin.299 Short-term con- sumption of quercetin may improve CVD risk factors, including endothelial function, in healthy volunteers and patients with CAD. In an RCT with a crossover design, healthy men who ingested 200 mg of quercetin experienced reduced levels of plasma endothe- lin-1 and increased levels of plasma nitrite and S-nitrosothiols, bio- markers of NO production.404 Hypertensive patients supplemented with 730 mg quercetin/day had significantly reduced systolic blood pressure.405

## Chemoprevention. Quercetin can induce apoptosis and stimulate

the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as NADPH, and qui- none oxidoreductase activity in human breast cancer cells.401,406 In a study of induced lung carcinogenesis in mice, quercetin pretreatment effectively prevented losses of SOD, catalase, GPx, GSH S-transferase, and GSH reductase while limiting tumor formation.407 Quercetin can increase the life span of tumor-bearing mice by up to fivefold through the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis.408 A case-control study found an inverse relationship between the intake of quercetin-rich foods and lung cancer risk, especially for heavy smokers. This effect corresponded to up-regulation of GSH transferase isozymes and downregulation of cytochrome P450 isoforms.409

# RESVERATROL

Grapes, blueberries, and peanuts contain resveratrol and methylated resveratrol, members of the stilbene family of polyphenols. Resveratrol can act as an antioxidant to scavenge free radicals and other antioxi- dants in vitro. It can also protect human erythrocytes against H 2 O 2 - induced lipid peroxidation.410 Stilbenes are rapidly cleared, and ingestion of acute doses of resveratrol by healthy subjects achieves only nanomolar plasma concentrations, levels several orders of magnitude less than those used for in vitro or animal studies.

## Cardiovascular Protection. Exposure to resveratrol correlated with

decreased myocardial damage associated with ischemia-reperfusion and inhibition of LDL-C oxidation.411 Possible mechanisms relating to anti-inflammatory effects include inhibition of COX and lipoxygen- ase and blocking the action of NK- κ B and AP-1 in cultured cells.412 A proteomic and immunoblot study revealed differential up-regulation of proteins related to energy metabolism in diabetic rat hearts com- pared with normal hearts.413 Resveratrol may also promote vasodila- tion. Resveratrol was found to activate human platelet eNOS, increase NO production, and reduce NOx activity, thus lowering superoxide production.414 It also increases NO production in vascular endothelial cells.415 Supplementation with a resveratrol-rich grape preparation was exam- ined in an RCT involving patients at high risk for CVD. Consumption of 8 mg resveratrol/day for 6 months followed by 16 mg/day for another 6 months reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF- α , and

plasminogen activator 1, together with decreased oxidized lipoprotein levels.416 Although preliminary human studies suggest that resveratrol may benefit cardiovascular health, it is doubtful that consuming up to glasses of red wine daily can provide enough resveratrol to achieve this effect.

## Diabetes. A study using experimentally induced diabetes in rats

found that resveratrol reduced glucose levels compared with untreated animals. Cardioprotection of diabetic rats involved induction of eNOS, vascular endothelial growth factor, and heme oxygenase.417 In humans, resveratrol has been linked to improved glucose and lipid metabolism. As an example, patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with 1000 mg of resveratrol daily for 45 days. Comparison with baseline and placebo measures in patients with type 2 diabetes revealed improved HbA1c levels and improved insulin sensitivity. HDL-C levels increased, and LDL-C levels decreased.418

## Chemoprevention. In various cancer cell lines, resveratrol expo-

sure can stimulate apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation.419 A study of rats fed resveratrol demonstrated that high-dose resveratrol sup- pressed a transgenic rat model of spontaneous prostate cancer.420 Yet several animal studies have reported a lack of effect of oral treatment with resveratrol on lung and colon cancer.

<!-- chunk -->

## Aging and Neuro-Protection. Resveratrol can increase longevity in

a variety of organisms, including mice.421 It may modulate transcrip- tion of the sirtuin gene family implicated in senescence, endothelial function, and angiogenesis. Sirt1, a deacetylase that silences transcrip- tion, can be induced by resveratrol in vitro. It is worth noting that low doses of resveratrol can improve cell survival by up-regulating anti- apoptotic and redox-regulating proteins, whereas high doses induce cell death by downregulating redox proteins and inducing production of apoptotic proteins.422 Although increased cerebral blood flow in healthy young adults given an oral dose of resveratrol (250 mg) has been reported in several investigations, reproducible benefits on cog- nition in humans remain to be established.423 Questions of bioavail- ability, long-term safety, effective dosage, and optimal duration of treatment have not yet been defined.424 It is worth pointing out that the administration of a resveratrol preparation (SRT501) led to serious side effects, including kidney failure. Safe ways of administering high doses of resveratrol would seem imperative before forming conclu- sions about clinical benefits.425

# CURCUMIN

Curcuminoids are bright yellow pigments found in turmeric and rep- resent a family of lipophilic diketones. Curcumin, the principal cur- cuminoid, is poorly absorbed. Serum concentrations in the nanomolar to micromolar range can occur with a single oral dose of up to 8 g.426 Curcumin possesses pleiotropic activities due to its ability to modify diverse signaling molecules, including proinflammatory cytokines, apoptotic proteins, NF- κ B, cyclooxygenases, C-reactive protein, adhe- sion molecules, and more.

## Inflammation. Curcumin can scavenge ROS and RNS in vitro.

In cultured colonic cells, curcumin inhibited iNOS; blocked lipoxy- genase, COX-2, and phospholipase A; and reduced the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes by inhibiting NF- κ B activation.427 Consumption of 200 mg/day of cur- cuminoids decreased serum lipid peroxide levels and LDL-C lipid per- oxidation in healthy subjects.428 Oral administration of emulsified curcumin to arthritic rats attenuated inflammation, implicating the gut–brain axis. Curcumin apparently corrected an imbalance between sympathetic and parasym- pathetic activity, increased vagus nerve excitability, and enhanced gut– brain acetylcholine synthesis.429 Clinical studies of curcumin on inflammatory conditions are pre- liminary. For example, an RCT of patients experiencing remission of ulcerative colitis examined high-dose curcumin supplementation in addition to standard treatment. After 6 months, 2 of 43 patients relapsed compared with 8 of 39 patients in a placebo group.430

## Cancer. Curcumin can induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis

and the production of matrix metalloproteinases in several cancer cell lines. Oral curcumin administration inhibited a mouse model of famil- ial adenomatous polyposis,431 and it inhibited the growth of human tumors in xenotransplant animal models. In clinical trials, curcumin has exhibited activity against multiple types of cancer. These studies demonstrated that curcumin is well tolerated at doses up to 8 g/day. As examples, treatment of patients with colorectal cancer with curcumin at a dose of 1.08 g/day for days improved weight gain while reducing serum TNF- α and induc- ing p53 expression.432 When patients with lung cancer who were smokers were treated with 1.5 g/day for 30 days, they had lowered urinary excretion of mutagens.433 A Phase I trial of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with curcumin 6 g/day according to a rotation schedule demonstrated that combination with docetaxel was well tolerated.434

## Neurodegeneration. In mouse models, curcumin can reduce

Alzheimer’s disease pathology. In vitro studies have shown that cur- cumin can block amyloid beta (A β ) aggregation. Curcumin can cause major structural changes in amyloid aggregates and potentially reduce A β toxicity.435 A mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease treated with cur- cumin for 7 days reduced existing plaques and structural irregularities in dystrophic dendrites.436 Of four clinical trials of curcumin supple- mentation for Alzheimer’s disease, the two that have been reported found no significant differences in cognitive performance between treated and placebo groups.437 Thus RCTs of patients with Alzheimer’s disease that incorporated doses of curcumin ranging from 1 to 4 g per day for up to 6 months found no differences between curcumin and placebo.438,439 Several studies of curcumin supplementation in Alzheimer’s disease are ongoing or results have yet to be published.

# THERAPEUTIC USE OF ANTIOXIDANTS

<!-- chunk -->

## Immunodeficiency and Oxidative Stress

Adequate levels of proinflammatory cytokines help balance anti- inflammatory Th2-mediated responses; consequently, restoring balance is a logical therapeutic goal.440,441 Supplementation with antioxidants, including vitamins C and E and carotenoids, along with selenium, copper, and zinc, may enhance aspects of innate and humoral immunity when used alone or in combination. These nutri- ents may improve lymphocyte proliferation, delayed hypersensitivity responses, and immune cell functions such as Th1 cytokine-mediated responses. However, an RCT of allergic individuals found no change in immune responses, serum antioxidant capacity, or markers of oxi- dative stress after 4-week supplementation with vitamins C and E, β -carotene, selenium, and zinc at levels several-fold higher than the recommended dietary allowances.442 A growing literature suggests that HIV infection is associated with oxidative stress. Sero-positive HIV patients were shown to have signifi- cantly reduced plasma TAC compared with healthy controls, a find- ing that correlated with significantly elevated lipid peroxidation and reduced levels of vitamins C and E, SOD, and oxidative stress, which may relate to HIV dementia.443,444 A cross-sectional study demon- strated increased plasma lipid peroxide levels along with depleted GSH levels in HIV-infected individuals compared with healthy controls.445 Low levels of reduced GSH could activate transcription factor NF- κ B to increase transcription of the HIV genome.446

## 748SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

It is logical to propose that antioxidant treatment could benefit HIV-positive individuals, and polyphenols and other antioxidants can inhibit HIV infectivity of cells in vitro.447 However, the results of clinical studies are mixed. An RCT found that oral supplementation with 1200 mg/day ALA for 10 weeks provided no benefit in treating HIV-related cognitive impairment.448 A review of six RCTs concluded that β -carotene/vitamin A did not change overall mortality, morbidity, or CD4 and CD8 counts, whereas four RCTs of other micronutrients did find improved overall mortality.449 Benefits of micronutrient sup- plementation in improving mortality among HIV-positive patients appears to involve correcting nutrient deficiencies.450 As an added consideration, high levels of vitamin C or vitamin E can potentially interfere with indinavir therapy.451

# EXERCISE AND OXIDATIVE STRESS

The health benefits of regular physical activity are well established. Physical inactivity is regarded as one of the most common risk fac- tors for CVD. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Some data suggest that long-term exercise increases antioxidant defenses as an adaptation. Clearly, effects vary depending on the type, intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise regimens, as well as individual fit- ness and medical history. Strenuous physical exercise increases ROS production and muscle fiber damage. Regular physical activity promotes up-regulation of antioxidant defenses. Anti-inflammatory actions of exercise focus on skeletal mus- cle, with increased mitochondria biogenesis, increased IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased TNF- α ; on adipose tissue, with decreased visceral fat, IL-6, and TNF- α and increased adiponectin; and on vasculature, with decreased NF- κ B and VCAM-1.452 The interplay of exercise-induced ROS and muscle redox-sensitive protein signaling seems to be linked to glucose homeostasis via stress-activated protein kinase and mito- gen-activated protein kinase pathways.453 Although vitamin C, vita- min E, ALA, l-carnitine, and flavonoids can attenuate certain signs and symptoms due to resistance training, they do not eliminate tissue injury. The field is confusing because of differing markers of antioxidant status and differing training levels. Furthermore, many studies use blood levels of antioxidants and ROS-induced by-products as end points to assess antioxidant status after exercise, a practice that con- tributes to variable test results. It is questionable whether these end points represent tissue-level changes. The benefits of micronutrient supplementation are most often seen in untrained subjects, rather than in athletes, especially when there are nutrient deficiencies. For example, supplementing with antioxidant vitamins such as E, C, and CoQ 10 may decrease exer- cise-induced oxidative damage in untrained individuals, especially in older people.454 In resistance-trained men, supplementation with 1000 mg/day of vitamin C and 378 mg/day of mixed tocopherols or placebo for 14 days did not change markers of muscle injury or oxidative stress (blood protein carbonyls and peroxides).455 Nonetheless, optimal doses of putative beneficial antioxidants and pretreatment intervals are unknown.456 Currently, there does not appear to be enough clinical evidence for recommending antioxidant supplements for well-trained and well-nourished athletes.457,458 Antioxidant supplementation may actually be counterproductive. As an example, an RCT of kayakers given standard antioxidants (vitamin C 400 mg, α -tocopherol 272 mg, β -carotene 30 mg, lutein 2 mg, selenium 400 mcg, zinc 30 mg, magne- sium 600 mg) daily for 4 weeks found that supplementation failed to lower lipid peroxidation induced by strenuous exercise, and it reduced muscle recovery times.459

## Do Antioxidants Explain the Health Benefits of Plant-

<!-- chunk -->

## Based Foods?

Consumption of plant-based foods rich in antioxidants was reported to decrease oxidative damage in humans by some authors,309 although others have found little effect.460 Analysis of data from the EPIC study found that eating five portions of fruits and vegetables daily lowered the overall risk of cancer by 9%, far less than expected.461 Nonetheless, previous studies concluded that five servings could reduce the risk of stroke; of cancers of the oral cavity, bowel, and lung; and obesity. Do antioxidants account for such benefits? Results of assays of antioxidant activity and assessments of oxidative stress reduction are suggestive, but as yet, there is no firm demonstration that in vitro measurements translate into specific health benefits. The FDA and the European Food Safety Authority concluded that claims cannot be made linking foods and food constituents to the protection of the body, cells, and molecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, from oxidative damage.462 Because short-term interventions with vitamins C or E, β -carotene, or flavonoids have not demonstrated consistent health benefits, the data suggest that other plant food factors may account for such pro- tection.463 As an example, flavonoids seem to account for only a small percentage of the oxidant capacity of apple extracts.294

## Antioxidant Supplementation for Disease Prevention?

A primary goal of supplementation is to correct any imbalances in an individual’s nutritional status. Overall, studies suggest that the recom- mended dietary allowances for antioxidants are inadequate for opti- mal immune function for certain groups. A second goal of antioxidant supplementation is to support the body’s defense systems and increase resilience. Antioxidant supplementation should be balanced against the oxidant burden. The prevalence of subclinical deficiencies of nutrients with antioxi- dant roles may be quite high—magnesium (56%), zinc (12%), vitamin E (93%), and vitamin C (31%) for general populations, as judged by intakes less than an estimated average requirement.34 More than 90% of Americans do not consume the dietary reference intake (DRI) for vitamin E of 15 mg, which is judged as adequate to prevent myopathy and neuropathy.464 Success with antioxidant supplementation is most notable when there are deficiencies, overt or not. According to a meta- bolic “triage” hypothesis, low micronutrient intake can increase the risk of chronic degenerative diseases without overt deficiencies because the body’s homeostatic mechanisms direct essential nutrients to support the most critical functions, leaving other functions with suboptimal levels.34 Multiple, complementary antioxidants are likely to be far more effective than large amounts of a single antioxidant because antiox- idants often work synergistically.465 Animal studies suggest that the consumption of a greater diversity of antioxidants is more effective than the use of single antioxidants. Daily supplementation with vita- min C (500 mg), vitamin E (400 IU), β -carotene (15 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) significantly slowed the progression of advanced AMD, although this regimen did not affect the risk of cataracts or loss of visual acuity.466 In other research, the combination of CoQ 10 , vita- min E, and ALA was shown to act synergistically in protecting LDL-C against lipid peroxidation in vitro.467 Table 97.1 provides a summary of the safe upper limits of antioxidant nutrients as well as recommended allowances for adults (ages >50 years). Notably, the levels of vitamins and minerals sometimes prescribed in protocols may be considerably higher than these recommendations.

status may minimize the effects of genetic predisposition that compro- mise defenses against degenerative disease, promote optimal health, and slow the aging process. A safe and effective way to increase the intake of a broad spectrum of defined and undefined antioxidants relies on increased consumption of a variety of antioxidant-rich foods, especially colored fruits, vegetables, and legumes and beverages such as green tea. The utility of this strategy in designing clinical trials is illustrated by the MIND diet, based on the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which emphasizes 10 brain-healthy food groups, including green leafy vegetables, berries, nuts, and wine. This hybrid diet was shown to slow cognitive decline related to aging and to reduce the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease.468 Target dietary reference intakes for phytochem- icals may eventually reflect composites beyond the currently recom- mended five daily servings of fruits and vegetables.469

# LIMITS OF ANTIOXIDANT SUPPLEMENTATION

The frequent negative or conflicting results from clinical trials of anti- oxidant supplements may reflect wide variations in the nutritional sta- tus and heterogeneity of antioxidant intake in study populations, as well as biochemical individuality (genetic polymorphisms) and medi- cal history, especially for an aging population for whom multiple phar- maceuticals are prescribed. No single supplement, nutrient, or food can maintain the body’s antioxidants and prevent disease, nor can single ingredients or foods cure a disease state. There are simply too many oxidants to be neutral- ized and too many layers of antioxidant defenses to be sustained, and the range of reactivity of water- and lipid-soluble ROS is far too great. Nor can antioxidant supplements substitute for a prudent diet and supportive lifestyle changes, including cessation of smoking, regular exercise, and effective stress management. A personalized approach to nutritional interventions generally, and to antioxidant usage specifically, must consider individual variability. Yet major challenges remain: For most antioxidants, used singly or in combinations, the dosage, duration, efficacy, safety, and levels needed to sustain optimal health remain unknown. This is especially true for polyphenols.470 In addition, a therapeutic window for beneficial effects is often inferred rather than clearly demonstrated.

# PROOXIDANT EFFECTS

A further caveat is that antioxidant supplementation can be coun- terproductive. As discussed earlier, physiological levels of ROS are essential in maintaining homeostasis for multiple systems. Thus super- oxide and NO play essential roles in maintaining the body’s defenses and homeostatic mechanisms. Yet imbalanced antioxidants can cre- ate “antioxidative stress,” in which antioxidants, especially exogenous species, can overwhelm the body’s essential free radicals and ROS. Prooxidant effects of antioxidants depend on several factors, includ- ing their concentration and redox potential, the presence of other antioxidants or transition metals, and the activities of endogenous antioxidants.471 As examples of potential benefits versus harmful effects, acute sup- plementation with vitamins C, E, and α -lipid acid negated the reduction of blood pressure and the improvement in flow-mediated vasodilation due to exercise in elderly hypertensive men.472 Transient oxidative stress, induced by short-term physical activity, can ameliorate insulin resistance. However, pretreatment with α -tocopherol 400 IU/day and vitamin C 1000 mg/day for 4 weeks prevented exercise-induced insulin sensitivity and blocked induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in healthy volunteers.473 Quercetin and myricetin efficiently inhibited Trx reductase to induce apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in tumor cell lines by direct binding and by semiquinone radical oxidation.474 The Trx system broadly affects redox balance in normal cells and tissues, and its inhibition may be detrimental to health. Finally, moderate concentrations of ROS mediate defenses against microorganisms, as well as damaged or cancerous cells. Excessive antioxidant supplements could interfere with these essential processes.

# VITAMIN E AND MORTALITY RISK?

A meta-analysis of 68 randomized trials found that supplementation up to 800 IU/day did not change the risk of all-cause mortality.144 A more recent metaregression analysis of 29 clinical trials representing a total of 138,462 participants and vitamin E dosages ranging from 16.5 to 5000 IU/day found no causal relationship between high-dose vita- min E and mortality.475 Indiscriminant use of high doses of vitamin E is not recommended.188,476 Vitamin E can interfere with vitamin K– dependent clotting factors, and high doses increase the risk of bleeding in at-risk individuals.

populations unless protected by antioxidants like vitamin E.477 When β -carotene is supplemented during oxidative stress, genotoxic cleav- age products are produced, and these may account for the carcino- genic effects observed in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC) and Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET).478 High levels of β -carotene may be contraindicated in smokers with myocardial infarction. In one study, the rate of fatal CHD rose in patients receiving 20 mg/day β -carotene (with or without α -tocopherol).479 Carotenoids generally lose their effectiveness at high concentrations. This feature may account for the possible benefits of consumption of carotenoid-rich foods, although therapeutic doses of isolated carotenoids may be deleterious.480

## Polyphenols and Mutagenicity?

The potential prooxidant actions of polyphenolic radicals are well documented.481 Flavonoids are metabolized and detoxified by liver enzymes. Pharmacological doses of flavonoids can induce Phase I detoxification enzymes, increasing their ability to modify antioxidant metabolites for excretion. The trade-off lies in the possibly greater sen- sitivity to mutagens and carcinogens when toxins are transformed into potential mutagens.

## Vitamin C, Toxicity, and Hypertension?

In vitro studies suggest that ascorbic acid can decompose lipid perox- ides to genotoxins.482 In vivo, these effects would likely require high ascorbate concentrations coupled with the depletion of tocopherol.483 Vitamins C and E exhibit prooxidant activity in vitro under certain conditions. When exposed to catalytic levels of iron or copper ions, ascorbate promotes the formation of H 2 O 2 and hydroxyl radicals.484,485 Excessive dietary iron or iron accumulation could promote ascor- bate-induced oxidation, and ascorbate could act as an oxidant in the presence of iron or copper released during inflammation or injury. In an RCT, hypertensive patients were treated with 500 mg ascorbic acid and/or 1000 mg grape seed polyphenols daily for 6 weeks. Although ascorbic acid alone reduced elevated systolic pressure, the combination significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.486

# LIMITATIONS OF ANTIOXIDANTS AS ADJUVANT

# CANCER THERAPY

Although antioxidant intake can influence the effectiveness of antican- cer therapy and related adverse effects, results depend on the type of cancer, the mechanism of action of the prescribed drug, and the type and dosage of antioxidants.487 A systematic review found that 24 of 33 RCTs reported decreased toxicity of chemotherapy with concomitant use of antioxidants, includ- ing vitamin E and vitamin C, with one study of vitamin A reporting increased toxicity.488 A study of pediatric patients with acute lympho- blastoma being treated with chemotherapy and concurrent supple- mentation with 400 IU vitamin E and 600 mg N-acetylcysteine daily for 28 days found that children taking the supplements experienced less liver toxicity, fewer blood abnormalities, and fewer blood trans- fusions.489 The use of α -tocopherol succinate to inhibit tumor growth in vivo remains unproven. Because this derivative possesses no anti- oxidant activity, presumably its inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells relies on other mechanisms.

# POTENTIAL NUTRIENT–DRUG INTERACTIONS AND

# PHYTOCHEMICAL–DRUG INTERACTIONS

The popularity of antioxidant supplementation comes with additional concerns regarding interactions with over-the-counter and prescrip- tion medications. The literature in these areas is steadily growing, and several useful compendia are available.490–493 In addition, the editors of the Pharmacist’s Letter publish the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, which is updated frequently. Botanical supplements can promote hepatoxicity via inhibition of cytochrome P450 induction of their expression. As examples, green tea extract and isolated catechins can inhibit multiple cytochrome P450 isozymes in human liver, as well as in animal models. In addition, turmeric can inhibit drug metabolism in human liver microsomes, although human subject data are lacking.494

## Redox Balance and the Gut Microbiome

Close relationships among commensals, pathogens, and the intesti- nal epithelium implicate ROS. As examples, Lactobacilli can activate NOX1 to enhance intestinal stem-cell proliferation. Disruption of the epithelial barrier can stimulate H 2 O 2 release from the mucosal lining to alter the microbial redox balance and reduce virulence. H 2 O 2 can directly kill pathogens, and it plays a role in intercellular microbial communication.495

# REDOX BALANCE AND GASO-TRANSMITTER

# SYSTEMS

The ROS and RNS help regulate hydrogen sulfate (H 2 S) and carbon monoxide, as well as NO. In particular, H 2 S most likely acts as a signal- ing molecule to increase antioxidant defenses.496 Lower levels of H 2 S tend to be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. Hypothetically, H 2 S regulates antioxidant genes while reducing NOX expression directly via thiol modifications, creating further linkage among H 2 S, GSH, cysteine metabolism, and NO.497

# REDOX BALANCE AND AGING

As described earlier, oxidative stress is a well-established factor in age-as- sociated diseases. Clearly, protein dysfunction occurs during aging, and proteasome-mediated degradation of oxidized species is essential for homeostasis.498 An increase in markers of systemic oxidative stress, such as protein carbonylation and the production of proinflammatory cyto- kines and lipid peroxides in older individuals, is matched by reduced expression of genes governing antioxidant responses.499 Any mechanisms must account for the linkage among calorie restriction, adipocyte SIRT1 activation, altered insulin sensitivity, and dysfunction of glucose regulation. Of the many proposals to account for the action of diet restriction on longevity, several relate to mito- chondrial oxidative stress.500 Cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking) induce eNOS uncou- pling and ROS/RNS production; eNOS glutathionylation is a possi- ble mechanism. Strong evidence indicates that increased expression and/or activation of the NOX family, especially NOX4, plays a role in age-related disease.501 There is interest in the role of ROS in a “geriatric syndrome,” characterized by reduced functional reserve and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress.502

# REDOX BALANCE AND MITOCHONDRIAL

# FUNCTION

Although global cellular oxidative stress would be expected to depend on ROS production versus ROS elimination (antioxidant defenses), ROS in mitochondria are much more dependent on highly local- ized ROS products than on antioxidants. Accordingly, ROS may not be viewed as by-products of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Instead, mitochondrial ROS seem to be carefully regulated at more or

less constant levels while endogenous antioxidants and DNA repair enzymes are temporarily induced as needed.500

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS: CONCEPTS AND STRATEGIES

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutrigenomics

Redox homeostasis and antioxidant status depend on how the individ- ual genetic makeup affects dietary responses and how gene–diet inter- actions promote disease, especially ways that food compounds affect gene expression regulating central pathways. The large-scale analysis of gene expression, individual proteins, and lipid markers, as well as the integration of metabolic pathways, can utilize functional analysis software. This approach demonstrated that a diet enriched in putative antioxidants can modulate low-grade oxidative stress and inflamma- tion in overweight men.503 The potential of herbs and botanicals in the prevention and treatment of conditions involving free radical pathol- ogy further enriches the future of antioxidant research.504 Nutrigenomics includes an examination of epigenetic processes, such as the role of microRNAs in chronic disease.505 MicroRNAs typically reg- ulate gene silencing, and they can be controlled by isolated nutrients and bioactive molecules, further indicating the importance of diet as related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and antioxidant defenses. Polyphenols, particularly flavonoids, possess epigenome-regulating actions involving DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and deacetyl- ation, as shown by studies of cultured cell lines. Quercetin, curcumin, EGCG, and berberine can function as sirtuin activators (histone acetyl- transferase) while inhibiting histone deacetylase.506 Genistein can act as an anticancer flavonoid in various cancer cell types via epigenetic control. Curcumin’s pleiotropic effects in reducing liver damage in experimen- tal cirrhosis include up-regulation of SIRT3, AMPK, and MnSOD.507 Whether epigenetic regulation is caused by prooxidant effects or by the antioxidant nature of these flavonoids has not been established.

# NUTRITIONAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE

The emerging discipline of nutritional cognitive neuroscience incor- porates nutrient biomarker patterns and indices of brain health based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) together with nutritional epidemiology.508 The latter employs principal component analysis to discover nutrient biomarker patterns. With this method, a pattern of antioxidants, vitamins C and E, the B complex vitamins, and vitamin D has been associated with increased cognitive func- tion.509 High-throughput analytical chemistry permits examination of up to thousands of metabolites of the metabolome.510 This approach has identified possible biomarkers for individual foods and dietary patterns, such as raspberries, citrus fruits, and overall fruit and veg- etable intake.511 Neuroimaging has been used to examine the role of diet and nutrients in structural brain changes during aging. Through this method, preservation of brain volume during aging has been associated with α -tocopherol, tocotrienol status, and vitamin C status, as well as reliance on a Mediterranean-style diet.512

# HORMESIS

The concept of hormesis has been recommended to understand how substances such as endogenous and exogenous antioxidants promote ROS production, especially in mitochondria. In this context, these agents may act as mild prooxidants at low concentrations (picomo- lar/submicromolar), as antioxidants at micromolar ranges, or as toxic prooxidants at high dosages (micromolar to millimolar). Theoretically, closely regulated constitutive ROS production could create a dynamic oscillating system, in which mitochondria and calcium flux play cen- tral regulatory roles.513

# ROS INTERACTOME

As a conceptual approach to integrating the complexity of redox bal- ance in metabolic control, a “reactive species interactome” has been proposed.514 Accordingly, a multilevel redox regulatory system allows the rapid adaptation to stressors to enhance resilience. System-level analysis may help sort out the ROS precursors, reaction products, and antioxidant signatures. Currently, there are no standards for nutrige- netic research outcomes in guiding the development of dietary recom- mendations. Criteria for evaluating the validity of this research and developing dietary guidelines have been proposed.515

# CONCLUSION

The broad outlines for antioxidant defenses against oxidative stress are established. However, our understanding of the inner workings of redox regulation remains incomplete, and details of the body’s response to oxidative stress remain poorly understood. Hundreds of redox switches have been uncovered using large-scale proteomic analysis.516 It is not clear how ROS are compartmentalized within a given cell type; indeed, monitoring ROS in vivo remains challenging. The translation of experi- ential findings into a therapeutic setting requires knowledge of how the same molecules mediate both pathological events and normal physio- logical responses. Threshold levels transforming “good” ROS into “bad” ones are likely to be different in healthy and diseased cells. These consid- erations apply to the development of personalized therapeutic protocols, advanced diagnostic procedures, and precise monitoring.

## Antiviral Effect

After reports that a woman stopped frequent recurrent outbreaks of herpes genitalis by taking 2 g prickly pear a day, studies investigated the plant’s antiviral effects.18 In hamster kidney cells, prickly pear spe- cifically reduced herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) replication at 3.5 mg/mL and completely inhibited replication at 15 mg/mL. Prickly pear also inhibited other herpes viruses (pseudorabies virus, bovine mam- millitis virus, equine herpesvirus type 1, as well as the more cell-associ- ated human herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus). Prickly pear inhibited replication by HSV-2 in infected human cervix tissue and inhibited RNA virus replication.18 Testing included a laboratory strain of influenza A virus, an isolate of the respiratory syncytial virus, and strains of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus and HIV-1. The only virus that prickly pear failed to inhibit was the picor- navirus EMC. The researchers found prickly pear to be a promising antiviral agent because it combines a breadth of in vitro reactivity with a high index of clinical safety. However, prickly pear pads combined with fresh Capsicum frutescens (cayenne) fruit and fresh Citrus limon (lemon) did not protect chickens from Newcastle virus.19

# CICATRIZANT EFFECT

When administered by mouth, dried prickly pear pad (O. ficus indica) significantly inhibited hydrochloride-induced, aspirin-induced, and ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats.20,21 Prickly pear did not affect gastric juice secretion, acid output, or stomach pH in the rats. Extracts of O. ficus indica showed significant wound-healing activity in rats.22

## Diuretic and Other Renal Effects

Fruit and flower infusions of O. ficus indica significantly increased diure- sis in rats, and the fruit infusion had an antiuric effect.14 Prickly pear pads (20 mg/100 g body weight daily for 5 weeks) significantly decreased uric acid levels and increased water intake while only slightly raising urine output in rats.23 Although the rise in urine flow was slight, the investiga- tors suggested that it could account for the greater excretion of uric acid. O. megacantha pads (20 mg/kg daily for 5 weeks) significantly increased urinary sodium output in diabetic rats and normal rats compared with controls.24 Prickly pear did not alter plasma aldosterone concentrations. In earlier studies, prickly pear extract administered orally (20 mg/100 g body weight) increased creatinine clearance in diabetic rats and raised plasma creatinine and urea levels in all rats.23,25

## Hypoglycemic Effect

Animal studies showed prickly pear pad had a hypoglycemic effect in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats and rabbits, although one study showed no effect if the rabbits’ pancreatic β -cells were completely obliterated.25–28 Prickly pear appears to improve glucose resistance/ sensitivity and glucose uptake through a mechanism that involves AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and GLUT4 translocation from intracellular storage vesicles to the plasma membrane in muscle cells (Fig. 98.2). In one study, prickly pear’s hypoglycemic effect was com- parable to that of tolbutamide.26 Prickly pear and insulin equivalently reduced, but did not normalize, glucose and insulin levels in dia- betic rats. Prickly pear combined with insulin had a synergistic effect. Diabetic rats given the combination rapidly achieved normal glucose levels, and at 7 weeks, they became hypoglycemic. At that point, prickly pear alone was sufficient to maintain normal glucose levels.27

## Hypocholesterolemic Effects

Prickly pear pectin was found to have a hypocholesterolemic effect in guinea pigs.29,30 Prickly pear consistently reduced blood choles- terol levels, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increased LDL density.

## Alcohol Intoxication

Prickly pear extract administered 5 hours before alcohol consumption reduced symptoms of a hangover. It appeared to act by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators.31 However, a subsequent sys- tematic review found no compelling evidence that prickly pear reduced hangovers.32

## Diabetes (Adult-Onset Non–Insulin-Dependent)

There are a number of clinical trials on the effect of prickly pear pad in non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).33–39 A pre- liminary meta-analysis of the clinical trials on prickly pear’s benefit

## 754SECTION 4 Pharmacology of Natural Medicines

in NIDDM concluded that the intervention data showed it to lower blood glucose levels by 10 to 30 mg/dL and supported claims that prickly pear had a true metabolic effect in diabetes.40 Although the control data were insufficient for a full meta-analysis, a statistically significant reduction of blood glucose and, when tracked, in insulin levels was seen consistently when broiled prickly pear was adminis- tered. The magnitude of the hypoglycemic effect varied from mild to moderate depending on the dose. For example, a 300-g dose of broiled pad acutely lowered blood glucose levels by 30 mg/dL in eight subjects, whereas 500 g lowered levels by an average of 45 mg/dL in the same subjects. In another open study of 14 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 300 g of steamed pad as part of a high-carbohydrate (HC) or high-soy- protein (HS) breakfast had antihyperglycemic and antihyperinsuline- mic effects in both. Prickly pear prevented postprandial blood glucose peaks in the HS breakfast.41 Most studies used broiled pads. One that used homogenized prickly pear pad preparation did not find a hypoglycemic effect.39 However, when the pad was ground in a regular blender rather than ultrahomogenized, it had an effect equivalent to that of broiled pads.33 Capsules of dried prickly pear did poorly in a small, cross- over, single-blind study, in which a single dose of 30 capsules had no hypoglycemic effect.42 Only a mild effect was seen in volunteers taking 30 capsules per day for 10 days—an impractical dose for most people. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel- arm study of 67 individuals with metabolic syndrome, a mixture of dehydrated prickly pear, chia seeds, oats, soy protein, Splenda, and flavoring did not affect blood glucose or insulin levels, although it did reduce the glycemic index after a glucose tolerance test and reduced serum triglycerides.43 In contrast, prickly pear has been shown to affect glucose lev- els mildly or not at all in normal individuals.34,36,44 In two studies, prickly pear pad did not reduce glucose or insulin levels in healthy volunteers. In a third study, nondiabetic individuals who ate broiled prickly pear pads before meals for 10 days showed a mild but signif- icant reduction in fasting glucose levels, but prickly pear pad had a significant hypoglycemic effect in volunteers in an induced hyper- glycemic state.42–46 In a fourth small study, a proprietary extract of prickly pear pad and fruit skin had an acute blood-glucose–lowering effect.47

## Hyperlipidemia

Prickly pear pads lowered cholesterol and triglyceride levels and improved cholesterol ratios in a small, non–placebo-controlled trial.36 Eight healthy patients, 14 obese patients, and 7 patients with NIDDM ate 100 g of broiled prickly pear pads before meals three times a day for 10 days. Each group experienced a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels; triglyceride levels also diminished significantly in obese and diabetic patients (23%–27%). An 8-week pilot study found that prickly pear pulp normalized blood fats as well as other indicators of metabolic syndrome in 24 hypercholesterolemic men.48 In another 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of women with metabolic syndrome, an extract of dehydrated prickly pear (NeOpuntia, 4.8 g/day) was reported to significantly increase high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.49 Based on this study, an application was made to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for permission to make a cardiovascular disease reduction claim for NeOpuntia. The application was denied because EFSA found that the evidence failed to demonstrate that NeOpuntia had a signifi- cant effect on blood parameters.50 A meta-analysis found that although prickly pear may have beneficial effects on total cholesterol, the effect sizes are small. It also found that studies are warranted on prickly pear’s ability to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.51 In 10 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, prickly pear upregulated LDL binding.52

## Osteopenia

A 2-year-long, blinded, randomized, quasi-experimental study (n = 181) compared women with normocalciuria taking 2.5 grams/day of prickly pear, women with hypercalciuria also taking 2.5 grams/day, women with hypercalciuria taking 15 grams/day, and untreated women with normal bone density. The high dose of dehydrated, mature prickly pear improved bone density (total hip and lumbar spine regions) and normalized calciuria levels in premenopausal women with low bone density and hypercalciuria.53

## Prediabetes

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 29 obese prediabetic individuals were given either 400 mg/day of a proprietary product, OpunDia consisting of 75% prickly pear pads and 25% fruit skins, or a placebo for 16 weeks. OpunDia was no more effective than placebo in lowering blood glucose concentrations.54

## Prostatic Hyperplasia

Dried prickly pear flowers improved the subjective symptomology of prostatic hyperplasia in a preliminary open study.55 Eighty-eight patients at two centers took two 250-mg capsules of flower extract three times daily for 2 to 6 months. Many patients reported decreases in urgency, emergency urination, and the sensation of fullness in the bladder, but not all patients experienced relief.

## Weight Loss

In a small, open-label study, prickly pear pads significantly reduced the body weight of obese and diabetic subjects and showed a trend toward weight loss in normal subjects.36 Fourteen obese patients, 7 patients with NIDDM, and 8 healthy patients ate 100 g of broiled prickly pear pad before meals three times a day for 10 days. Each group showed a mean reduction in weight of 1.5 kg while maintaining their usual diets. In another double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, two 500-mg capsules of IQP G-002AS (a prickly pear fiber derivative with added soluble fiber from Acacia species) three times daily triggered statistically significant weight loss in the active group (n = 123). Some 75% of those on the active treatment lost at least 3% of their body weight compared with just 28% of the placebo group, a statistically significant difference.56 Nonetheless, a subsequent meta-analysis did not find that prickly pear supplementation had a statistically signif- icant effect on body weight, although significant reductions in body mass index, percentage body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol levels were observed.57


Studies of the use of this plant have used a variety of forms of prickly pear pad. Most have used broiled or grilled pads, whereas some studies have used juiced slurries. These studies used 100 to 500 g (3–17 oz) of pads three times a day, taken before meals. There is little information on dried preparations, but as mentioned previously, such preparations did not achieve results in some small trials.


Prickly pear showed a high degree of safety in studies of mice, horses, and humans.28 It has a long history of use as a food, a factor that also indicates a high level of safety. Most adverse events involving the plant are the result of its glochids (tiny, nearly invisible spines), which can

## 755CHAPTER 98 Opuntia Species (Prickly Pear)

become embedded in the skin.58 Sabra dermatitis is an occupational disease among prickly pear fruit handlers, in which the glochids cause a widespread skin eruption resembling scabies, which in chronic cases involves granuloma formation. However, in two animal stud- ies, prickly pear significantly raised blood urea and creatinine levels in rats and increased urinary creatinine clearance rates in diabetic rats only.23,24 The researchers expressed concern that prickly pear perhaps caused an early stage of kidney dysfunction in rats. However, the same researchers did not report similar results in a subsequent study, and no other studies have reported such effects.25


No human data on drug interactions are available for prickly pear. All herbs rich in complex carbohydrates may affect transit time and thus may alter the absorption of practically any medication. Many of the diabetes trials of this plant included patients who were taking oral hypoglycemic agents (tolbutamide, glyburide, chlorpro- pamide), and no adverse interactions were reported.34–36,38,59 Prickly pear and insulin had a synergistic effect in rats, first normalizing blood sugar levels and then inducing hypoglycemia.27 The effect of combin- ing prickly pear and insulin in human subjects has not been studied.
