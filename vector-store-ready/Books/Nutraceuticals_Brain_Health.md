The brain is a complex organ that neuroscientists are still
attempting to understand. This is unique because of its high
metabolism and high turnover of nutrients, and this makes
it a high-maintenance device in terms of optimal nutrient
intake. Moreover, the brain is highly prone to oxidative
stress owing to high fatty acid content (especially poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, which contribute to 10% of total dry
weight),
high
oxygen
consumption
redox
signaling (about 20% basal oxygen for ATP production),
low antioxidant content with higher neurotransmitter auto-
oxidation [2]. Due to the multifactorial nature, the role of
nutrition and nutritional products in cognitive neuroscience
is complex. The concern is not simply with the impact of a
single chemical on the brain but with multiple nutrients,
metabolites, and interacting factors. In addition, a myriad of
nutrient-speciﬁc
transport
systems
physiological
mechanisms add more complexities in the nutrient-gut-
brain interaction.
As people live longer, dysfunction of the brain is
becoming a predominant issue for the healthcare system.
Cognitive decline, particularly in elderly people, often de-
rives from the interaction between age-related changes and
age-related diseases, and covers a wide spectrum of clinical
manifestations, from intact cognition through mild cogni-
tive impairment and dementia.
Chang et al. [1] classiﬁed 92 diseases as age related,
meaning that the incidence rate of each disease increased
quadratically with age. The disability-adjusted life-years
(DALYs) from each disease among adults are used to
calculate the age-related disease burden. Burden varied
between countries, being lowest in Switzerland (104$9
DALYs per 1000 adults) and Singapore (108$3 DALYs)
and highest in Papua New Guinea (506$6 DALYs) and
Afghanistan (380$2 DALYs), with low socio-demographic
index. The effect is quite pronounced for age groups 60e64
and above.
By 2050, the 85-year-old and above population in the
United States will triple [3]. Other than cardiovascular
diseases and cancer, brain-related disorders such as psy-
chological
health-associated
disorders,
dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, and depres-
sion are the leading causes of ill-health in the older popu-
lation. Older people make up a considerable proportion of
Australia’s populationdin 2017, over one in seven people
were aged 65 and over. The increase in costs due to the
85þ age group ($2.9 billion) represents some 23% of the
total increase in costs ($12.5 billion) but only about 8% of
the total projected health costs ($35 billion).
Age-related
vary
considerably across individuals and lifecycle stages, with
some cognitive functions appearing to be more susceptible
than others to the effects of aging. The brain undergoes
tremendous
age-associated
structural
functional
changes as we age. Like age-related changes in brain
structure and function, age-related changes in cognition are
not uniform across all cognitive domains, or across all older
individuals. The basic cognitive functions most affected by
age are attention and memory. Older adults show signiﬁ-
cant impairments in attention tasks, particularly on multi-
tasking platforms. General knowledge, vocabulary, and
verbal ability do not signiﬁcantly decline throughout the
lifecycle.

beyond, the editor brings together contributions from ex-
perts in nutraceutical research to provide a contemporary

beneﬁcially affect brain function at the molecular and
clinical level. When we are talking about brain health,
mostly we are focusing on cognition and memory. But
there are many complex brain disorders beyond cognition
and memory.
From the perspective of prehistoric medicine in the
ancient world, plants have been used in the treatment of
medical conditions throughout human history. Historically,
all these terms, apothecary, herbalism, ethnopharmacology,
phytotherapy, and alternative medicine, are linked to
modern nutraceuticals. Nutraceutical-related research of
molecular and clinical actions follows from the concept that
traditional medicines or tribal practices offer neuroactive
agents that cure brain-related diseases or disorders. The
goal then is to elucidate how these neuroactive molecules
from these sources might make the brain healthier and, in
this book, we have several exciting basic studies that
represent the prototype of how this ﬁeld needs to evolve.
The neuroscience in the 21st century has shown
tremendous growth, particularly in the identiﬁcation of
targets that provide therapeutic beneﬁt in degenerative
conditions, and neurodevelopmental, psychological, and
psychiatric disorders through many randomized clinical
trials. Since many natural products used in traditional
medicine have long been known to exert beneﬁcial actions
on diverse brain functions and often the active principles
have been identiﬁed, the prospect of future success in
the ﬁeld of neuro(nutra)ceuticals continues to capture the
imagination of many neuroscientists and is also entering the
developmental drug pipeline [4].
This book presents the state-of-the-art scientiﬁc evi-
dence, challenges, and potential applications within this
exciting ﬁeld, by providing insight into the treasures of
Ayurvedic, Persian, and Western traditional medicines to
treat neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, psychological,
and psychiatric disorders of brain. Few important and up-
coming issues such as brain epigenetics, gut-microbe-brain
axis, and intelligent drug delivery mechanism are also dis-
cussed by eminent scientists. How “Big Data” is impacting
clinical research is also discussed here. Well publicized and
controversial role of vitamin B-6, B-9, and B-12 in Alz-
heimers disease is also discussed. The exciting ﬁelds of
cardiometabolic impact on cognitive health and role of
oxidative stress-antioxidant in elderly are also presented
here. I believe our readers in the community, students, re-
searchers, and industry R&D use the information, tech-
niques, and insights of the book to support application of this
research and teaching. It is also my belief that this book be
used to promote a collaborative understanding of the ﬁeld
between industry and academia. More broadly, however, I
hope that this book is accessible to nonspecialist readers, and
so can also be utilized by those in the community with keen
interest in understanding this research to learn more about
(neuro)nutrients and dietary patterns which may provide
cognitive protection or beneﬁt, particularly to elderly people.

Thinking outside the brain
With magniﬁcent advancement in medical science over the
last century, human life span has also increased signiﬁ-
cantly. However, with this advancement comes another
potential challenge particularly, the people aged 70 years
and more are become increasingly susceptible to chronic
and extremely debilitating brain diseases, most notably
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
There is growing concern that many existing drug
treatments for neurodegenerative disorders are unable to
prevent the underlying degeneration of neurons and
consequently there is a strong market pull to develop
alternative therapies capable of preventing progressive
neurodegeneration. Conventional use of antioxidant thera-
pies to combat neuronal damage is well accepted, but
exploration of neuroprotective effects of a group of plant
secondary metabolites known as ﬂavonoids and other nat-
ural products is increasing. The potential beneﬁcial effects
of speciﬁc polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have also
been explored more than before. Increasing aging popula-
tion and subsequent cognitive disability have now emerged
as one of the greatest health threats globally. There is a
common consumer belief that neurological diseases such as
dementia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s might be prevented
or treated through personalized dietary intervention. How-
ever, there is limited evidence that such approaches are
effective, and they might even be harmful in some cases.
Nutrition plays a central role in hypotheses about hu-
man evolution, particularly the emergence of large-brained,
anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa w200 ka.
Encephalization, increase in brain size that characterizes the
human species, is supposed to be linked with the avail-
ability of food resources rich in energy as well as trace
elements and fatty acids collectively referred to as brain-
selective nutrients [1]. Neurodiversity has become a pop-
ular topic not only in medical science but also in business.
The overlapping Venn diagram (Fig. 2.1, courtesy Dr.
Nancy Doyle based on the work of Mary Colley) pictured

to be explored for truly understanding the beneﬁts of
cognitive difference between people.

insufﬁciency in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) [3].
Indeed, there is convincing evidence that nutrients are
essential for human health and physiological functioning.
The human body cannot synthesize certain nutrients inter-
nally (not at all or not in sufﬁcient amount) and they need to
be complemented from food [4]. Particularly the brain with
a high metabolism and high turnover of nutrients requires
optimal nutrient intake.
Energy status and brain health
Brain health has been deﬁned as, “a state of well-being in
which the person can realize their potential, cope with
normal stresses of life, work productively and fruitfully and
contribute to the community.” In addition to cultural, eco-
nomic, social, and environmental factors, energy status has
been identiﬁed as holding a critical role in brain health and
well-being. The term energy status mentioned here includes
energy intake, physical activity, and energy metabolism.
Considerable evidence links physical activity and optimal
energy intake with improved mood and cognitive function,
while both underweight and obesity are associated with
impaired cognitive performance. Suboptimal energy status,
including undernutrition and overnutrition, is linked with
mental and neurological disorders such as depression,
schizophrenia, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Individual differences in genetic variability are related to
the incidence of these disorders. Rather than considering an
individual as having high or low energy status, the focus is
on optimal compared with suboptimal energy status.
Neuroactive in foods
A neuroactive substance is deﬁned as a chemical agent
synthesized by a neuron, which affects the properties of
other neurons and muscle cells. Many neuroactive com-
pounds have signiﬁcant roles as neurotransmitters, neuro-
modulators, and neurohormones [5]. These compounds
have been not only synthesized by humans but also plants
microorganisms
[6].
Therefore,
presence
neuroactive compounds in foods is inevitable. Most com-
mon
neuroactive
foods
gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, melatonin, kynur-
enine, kynurenic acid, dopamine, norepinephrine, hista-
mine,
tryptamine,
tyramine,
b-phenylethylamine.
Fermented foods contain some of these compounds, which
can affect human health and mood [7,8]. Neuroactive
compounds present in certain raw and nonfermented foods
are given in Table 2.1. Health effects of neuroactive com-
pounds consumed with foods have no deﬁnite mechanism.

It is now established that the composition of diet is
signiﬁcant for gut microbiota proﬁle. There are a number of
functional networks in the brain related to different mind
states and mood, such as depression and anxiety, sleep,
wakefulness, arousal, perception of pain, etc. Neuronal
signaling is mediated by the release of neurotransmitters
(NTs) at synapses between axons and dendrites. There are
many types of NTs and other signaling substances in the
brain:
amino
(glutamate,
g-aminobutyric
(GABA), glycine), catecholamines (dopamine, norepi-
nephrine), monoamines (serotonin, acetylcholine ACh),
biogenic amines (histamine, tryptamine, tyramine, etc.), a
number of peptides, purines such as adenosine as well as
nitric oxide (NO) [9,10]. The delicate balance between
synthesis, uptake, and regeneration of NTs can easily be
disturbed, and this is one of the main targets when treating
neuropsychiatric disorders. Many dietary components can
affect the amount and effect of NTs [11]. The amino acid
tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin, and dietary supply
of tryptophan can inﬂuence serotonin levels in the brain
[12]. The amino acid tyrosine is the precursor of the NTs
dopamine and norepinephrine, and its supplementation
seems to enhance cognitive performance, particularly in
stressful situations [13]. The biogenic amines, histamine
and tyramine, present in stored or fermented foods, are
considered as active NTs in the brain [14,15]. There are
more reports about the effects of carbohydrates, proteins,

and polyphenols on the composition of the gut microbiota.
Synthesis of neuroactive compounds can be affected by diet
in three ways:
1. Firstly, since amino acids are precursors of neuroactive
compounds, proteins or peptides, in the diet which
reach the colon, it can lead to the formation of neuroac-
tive compounds by gut microbiota.
2. Secondly, some metabolites (short-chain fatty acids,
etc.) formed because of fermentation of carbohydrates
and proteins in the gut can trigger the synthesis of neu-
rotransmitters in the human gut.
3. Thirdly, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and polyphe-
nols can alter the composition and count of microorgan-
isms which have the ability to produce neuroactive
compounds.
Omega-3 and phytochemicals: potential
future therapeutic candidates
The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs
and, as such, utilizes a large proportion of the dietary intake
of carbohydrates to function effectively. The dietary lipids,
such as PUFAs, are also thought to play a much important
role in supporting optimum brain function by maintaining
the optimal function of cholinergic neurons arising from the
basal forebrain and terminating in the cortex and hippo-
campus [16]. This information is leading the way to
develop a strategy to prevent the cognitive decline that
occurs during normal aging and in AD. The well-
characterized and demonstrated effects of both dietary
phytochemicals and lipids on endothelial function and pe-
ripheral blood ﬂow may also enter into the list of future
candidate molecules for brain health. Phenolic compounds
are secondary metabolites of plants and include ﬂavonoids,
lignans, stilbenes, coumarins, and tannins [17]. Please refer
Table 2.3 for more information on food components that
have ability to ameliorate brain function. Despite this list,
components derived from Vitis vinifera (grape), Camellia
sinensis (tea), Theobroma cacao (cocoa), and Vaccinium
spp (blueberry) have demonstrated beneﬁcial effects on
human vascular function and on improving memory and
learning. The PAQUID Study was one of the ﬁrst epide-
miological studies to suggest that ﬂavonoids play a pro-
tective role against cognitive decline and AD [18,19,20].
More recent ﬁndings from the SU.VI.MAX studies conﬁrm
earlier results, showing an association between polyphenols
intake and better performance in language and verbal
memory tasks [21].
PUFAs could be involved in the maintenance of
cognitive function and have a preventive effect against
antithrombotic
antiin-
ﬂammatory properties, in addition to their speciﬁc effect on
neural functions [22]. Indeed, DHA is a key component of
membrane phospholipids in the brain, and adequate n-3
PUFA status may help maintain neuronal integrity and
function via a range of potential mechanisms. DHA may
modify the expression of genes that regulate a variety of
biological functions potentially important for cognitive

Fatty ﬁsh is the primary dietary source of EPA and DHA,
the longer-chain n-3 fatty acids. A growing body of evi-
dence suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA),
and oleic acid may also have antiinﬂammatory effects [24].
Recent longitudinal studies support the hypothesis that
MUFA may play a protective role toward the development
of cognitive decline and dementia [25,26].

sumption with dementia risk to populations in low and
middle-income countries. Kyriacou et al. [27] study
conﬁrmed that marine animals and, especially, intertidal

copper, and zinc. The collection and consumption of

Cognition beyond foods: just diet or
lifestyle pattern?
“Mediterranean diet” is a term always closely association
with cognitive health. This concept is supported by many
observational studies. But some lifestyle behaviors, beyond
diet, have an evidence-based synergistic “association-
effect” with cognitive health, although not well studied
by robust clinical setup. In the lines of the concept of “food
synergy,” several nutritional experts propose a “lifestyle
behavior synergy” to investigate the link between food and
cognitive decline. Other factors such as socialization,
physical activity, leisure activities, and appropriate rest
could be expanded by studying all these in concert, or/and
as an independent factor also. This approach may help to
develop even more comprehensive dietary intervention
strategies on cognitive health.
It is well accepted that diet and lifestyle have been
shown to play an important role in halting the progression
of neurodegenerative diseases and impaired cognitive
function through the enhancement of structural and func-
tional plasticity in the hippocampus, increased expression
of neurotrophic factors, maintenance of synaptic function,
and adult neurogenesis [28]. Dietary interventions have
emerged
inducers
plasticity,
e.g., calorie restriction and intermittent fasting [29,30].
There is a long-term positive effect on cerebral blood ﬂow
in response to lifestyle interventions with restricted diet,
weight loss, and increased physical activity [31]. In order to
provide the brain with all components necessary to support
the synthesis of new synapses and maintenance of existing
neuronal connections, thereby possibly reducing the con-
sequences of AD, specially designed multicomponent
(DHA, EPA, UMP, choline, folic acid, vitamins B6, B12, C
E, selenium and phospholipids) diets have been proposed,
e.g., Souvenaid (Fortasyn Connect) [32,33].
Food “liking” versus food “wanting”
We need a better understanding of how humans evaluate
foods and make choices about them, particularly if asso-
ciated with objective brain markers underlying decision-
making processes. This is of great interest because eating-
related disorders and especially obesity incidences are
still increasing world-wide. In daily life, decisions of food
eating are determined by hunger (homeostatic needs), and
also by hedonic drives that can even override homeostatic
needs [34]. In human food choice behavior science, a
prominent concept dominates a dissociation of processes
related to food “liking” as opposed to “wanting,” as well as
how liking and wanting impact food choices and intake
[35]. Behaviorally, Bielser et al. showed (unsurprisingly)
that “strongly liked food items were more frequently cho-
sen than dismissed, and that disliked items were more
frequently dismissed than chosen.” In this study, partici-
pants rated how much they liked each food item (valuation)
and subsequently chose between the two alternative food
images. The ﬁndings [34] show that the spatiotemporal
brain dynamics to food viewing are immediately inﬂuenced
both by how much foods are liked and by choices taken on
them. Because food intake is inﬂuenced by neurosensory
stimulation and memory cues, personalized food images
may be useful in prompting appropriate affective responses
to food intake, which may subsequently lead to healthier
eating behaviors. Whole brain analyses suggested [36] that
the visualization of personal images of diet evoked greater
brain activation in memory regions (e.g., superior frontal
gyrus). This also generates mediating emotion (e.g., thal-
amus, putamen, anterior cingulate cortex), imagery, and
executive functions (e.g., inferior orbitofrontal gyrus,
fusiform, and parietal lobe) compared to a written dietary
record.
Diet, aging, and neurodegenerative
Aging is commonly associated with a decline in cognitive
functioning, which ranges from mild cognitive impairment
to dementia. Up to 50% of individuals with mild cognitive
impairment will develop dementia within 5 years [37]. AD,
the most prevalent cause of dementia, is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by global cogni-
tive impairment affecting memory, language, and other
behavioral functions [38,39]. Although old age is the main
risk factor for dementia, other prominent factors have been
shown to be diet-related [40]. These include obesity, hy-
pertension, and unbalanced diets [41]. Dietary components
have been demonstrated to modulate cerebral structure and
connectivity, cognition and emotion, and to induce changes
in brain and behavioral functions [42]. Nutritional ap-
proaches to manage AD include “healthy” dietary patterns
(e.g., Mediterranean diet) with individual components that
may produce positive effects on pathophysiological pro-
cesses of AD [43]. Ketogenic dietary approaches target
energetic deﬁcits and reduce glucose utilization in AD [44],
and medical foods also meeting speciﬁc nutritional needs of
individuals with AD [45].
PD is the second-most common neurodegenerative
disease after AD and is hallmarked by damage to the
dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and by alpha
synuclein containing inclusion bodies (Lewy pathology;


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 24

LP) in the surviving neurons, resulting in the characteristic
motor impairment. Although PD is generally considered as
a movement disorder, it has long been recognized that the
symptoms go beyond motor dysfunction, since PD patients
very often develop nonmotor symptoms, including cogni-
tive impairment [46], depression [47], and others. Levo-
dopa is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of
PD. No current therapeutic strategies have a favorable in-
ﬂuence on PD progression and they have shown to develop
several side effects [48]. Current treatment does not prevent
dopaminergic neuron degeneration and has no effect on
nonmotor
symptoms
[49].
Nutritional
interventions
phospholipid
precursors
and/or
microbiota-directed therapy like prebiotics and probiotics
might provide opportunities to complement the traditional
PD therapies and overcome some of their shortcomings
including lack of efﬁcacy for GI symptoms/dysfunction.
Dietary interventions might have some positive effect on
the gut-brain axis by altering microbiota composition (and
therefore altering PD pathogenesis) [50,51]; or by affecting
neuronal functioning in both the ENS and the central ner-
vous system. Speciﬁc nutrient combination containing
neuronal precursors and cofactors may counteract synaptic
loss and reduce membrane-related pathology in the CNS
and the ENS of PD patients. Uridine (as uridine mono-
phosphate, UMP), the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), and choline are phospholipid precursors
needed for the formation and maintenance of neuronal
membranes [52]. Various studies have reported the bene-
ﬁcial effects of probiotics such as representatives of Lac-
tobacilli, Enterococci, Biﬁdobacteria, yeasts by enhancing
intestinal
epithelial
integrity,
protecting
barrier
disruption, stimulating a healthy homeostasis of the
mucosal immune system and suppressing pathogenic bac-
terial growth [53,54]. Ingestion of selected probiotics also
exhibited beneﬁcial effects on brain function in humans.
The administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota in
chronic fatigue syndrome patients signiﬁcantly decreased
anxiety symptoms [55].
The insulin Insert ’-’ in-between ’Insulin’ & ’like’like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays an essential role in energy
metabolism in the brain. The metabolic capacity of the
mitochondria is dependent on the IGF-1 signaling pathway
[56]. The degradative product of IGF-1, cyclic glycine-
proline (cGP), is a key factor in the brain that normalizes
IGF-1 signaling, essential for cognitive function [57].
Several clinical trials in which patients suffering from PD
received supplementation of blackcurrant anthocyanins
extract have demonstrated increased levels of cGP [58].
Diet, cognition, and epigenetics
Several recent groundbreaking studies have highlighted the
potential possibility of extending the effects of diet on
cognitive health across generations. The outcomes of these
studies have great impact on the development of future
strategies for combating several diseases. Overall these
studies indicate the importance of dietary components in
inﬂuencing epigenetic events i.e., nongenetic events, such
as DNA methylation, transcriptional activation, trans-
lational control, and posttranslational modiﬁcations that
cause a potentially heritable phenotypic change and, thus,
their potential for disease modulation. Although the exact
molecular mechanisms for the epigenetics inﬂuence of diet
are not properly known, it is understood that the brain-
derived neurotrophic factor system is particularly suscep-
tible to epigenetic modiﬁcations that inﬂuence cognitive
function. For instance, the serotonergic system is inﬂu-
enced by early nutrition and stress, causing epigenetic
modiﬁcations that affect expression and are linked to bi-
polar disorders and depression in later stage of life [59]. A
number of additional direct connections between nutrition
and epigenetics have been identiﬁed [60]. As for example,
methionine, folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12, choline, and
glycine betaine are all important for the one-carbon meta-
bolism which can affect DNA methylation. Genistein from
soy and tea catechins affect DNA demethylation and his-
tone modiﬁcation, whereas resveratrol from red wine, sul-
foraphane from broccoli, butyrate, diallyl sulﬁde (garlic),
and curcumin (turmeric) all affect histone acetylation, and
retinoic acid is affecting miRNA transcription. Oleuropein,
tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosol from olive tree (Olea euro-
paea) demonstrate neuroprotective
effects,
partly
epigenetic modiﬁcations [61].
These studies clearly demonstrating the intracellular
signaling pathways triggered by lifestyle factors can pro-
mote long-lasting changes in DNA function in the brain and
in cognitive capacity. For an example, a diet that is high in
saturated fat reduces the expression of Silent information
regulator 2 (SIRT2) in the rat hippocampus, whereas a diet
that is high in omega-3 fatty acids has the opposite effect.
This is just an early warning on stable and heritable asso-
ciation of our own bad lifestyle and cognitive decline for
generations.
Microbiota-targeted functional foods
for brain health
The etiology of most neuropsychiatric disorders is likely
multifactorial, based on both genetic and environmental
factors (Fig. 2.2 [62]), particularly, the environmental fac-
tors can directly affect the gut microbiome that, in turn, can
affect host physiology. In recent years accumulating body
of evidence indicates a bidirectional communication be-
tween the gastrointestinal tract and the brain, an interaction
termed as the “gut-brain axis” [63]. This interaction relates
to the gut microbiota and the physiology and pathology of
the mammalian brain. During homeostasis, we have a

symbiotic relationship with our gut microbes that ensure a
regulated and healthy brain development. However, “dys-
biosis” (i.e., an imbalanced population of gut microbes),
can lead to pathological states, including brain pathologies.
Normal gut microbiota has been shown to lead to proper
brain development and behavior. Gut dysbiosis has been
shown to be associated with neurological disorders, such as
psychiatric disordersddepression and anxiety, as well as
autism and neurodegenerative diseases [64,65]. The gut
microbiota has been shown to impact CNS neurogenesis. In
addition, the gut microbiota was shown to impact neuronal

communicate
host
neurochemicals.
Considering all study outcomes in recent years, modu-
lation of the gut microbiota using dietary intervention, in
particular with prebiotics and probiotics, is a promising
strategy in promoting normal brain function and mental
health. Prebiotics may exert a beneﬁcial brain effect
through improving host immunity, enhancing SCFA pro-
duction, reducing potentially pathogenic microbes, and
improving gut barrier function [66]. Lactobacillus spp. and
Biﬁdobacterium spp. are the most used probiotics and may
act via a number of mechanisms to alter the gut microbiota
of the host in order to improve brain health. This inter-
vention may help in production of antimicrobial com-
pounds, reduction of the luminal pH through the production
of SCFA, competitive exclusion of other microbes from
adhering to epithelial cells, production of growth substrates,
enhancing barrier function, and modulation of immune
responses [67].

As discussed previously, polyphenols are a large group
of compounds naturally occurring in plants and a variety of
foods, including citrus fruits, cocoa, red wine, tea, and
coffee. Large-scale epidemiological investigations suggest
that a diet rich in polyphenols may help maintain normal
brain function and mental health [19]. Interventional
studies in humans provide some supportive evidence for
this epidemiological data (see Table 2.3).
Antiinﬂammatory and antioxidant properties and mod-
ulation of enzyme activity have been proposed to be
responsible for the positive CNS effects of polyphenols
[19], but due to the poor bioavailability of most of the
polyphenols [68], approx. 90%e95% of total dietary
polyphenols accumulate in the large intestine where they
are broken down into less complex metabolites by the gut
microbiota [69]. For example, black and green tea (epi-
gallocatechin, epicatechin, catechin) have been shown to
affect the growth of Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus
aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes,
while other polyphenols have been shown to promote the
growth of beneﬁcial bacteria, such as Biﬁdobacterium
spp. [70].
It is likely that the beneﬁcial CNS effects of polyphenol
compounds are mediated, at least in part, by interactions
with the gut microbiota [71]. So it is imperative that when
scientists
technologists
developing
polyphenol-based brain function enhancing products, they
should consider the large interindividual variation in gut
microbiota composition, which may signiﬁcantly affect
polyphenol bioefﬁcacy [69].
Thinking outside the brain
The brain is traditionally known to play an essential role in
governing and coordinating our systemic homeostasis. In
recent years, it is also becoming clear that the conditions of
brain health are intimately associated with other physio-
logical systems. Therefore, a much more complex picture
has emerged concerning the exact pathophysiological basis
of cognitive deﬁcits and many other neuropsychological
disorders [72]. Despite much conceptual progress made so
far, disappointment exists for the CNS drug discovery
mode that solely focuses on the brain but ignores peripheral
mediators. To achieve this holistic goal, it will be impera-
tive to look beyond the brain and integrate an interdisci-
plinary approach to the research pipeline. These emerging
ﬁndings have shed novel insights into cognitive dysfunc-
tions and also raised a number of interesting questions on
future preventive and therapeutic strategies.
Major pathways outside brain in cognitive regulation
are:
Neuroimmune signaling and cognition
Endocrinal signaling and cognition
Metabolic signaling and cognition
The blood-brain barrier
Although food has traditionally been perceived as a sup-
plier of energy and building material to the body, its ability
to prevent and protect against diseases is starting to be
recognized by consumers, industries, and regulators. There
is a tendency to think of nutritional supplements “as
harmless at worst and beneﬁcial at best.” However, at the
same time several recent trials warn about this hypothesis.
Due to the encouraging results of clinical and preclinical
studies, the topic has attracted substantial global media
attention in recent years. The downside of this hype is
scientiﬁc understanding of perceived beneﬁts and actual
cause-beneﬁt relationships of such supplementation.
The roles of genomics and epigenomics in modulating
the effects of nutrition on the brain and mental health are
very important directions and need to be included in our
future healthcare strategies. In the long term, personalized
nutrition, based on individual genetic variability and envi-
ronmental susceptibility, should help to optimize brain
function, and prevent or alleviate mental disorders.
Finally, one important issue to be determined under
strict clinical environment is that whether the functional
foods (prebiotics, probiotics, omega-3 PUFAs, and poly-
phenols) can be employed as stand-alone nutritional solu-
tions to promote normal brain function and mental health,
or will be most effective as adjunct to current therapeutic
approaches.
Brain health is one of the rapidly developing ﬁelds, new
ﬁndings are continually emerging which bolster our
knowledge of how the gut microbiota inﬂuence brain
function and behavior. Despite signiﬁcant gains over the
past decade in understanding the mechanisms underlying
the development and manifestation of most major psychi-
atric disorders, few advances have been made in the dis-

Psychobiotic’ interventions, which target pathways of
microbiota-gut-brain axis, represent a new era in psycho-
tropic therapies and hold great promise in promoting
normal brain function and mental health across the lifespan.

Cognition is deﬁned as the mental ability in the process of
acquiring
knowledge
learning,
thinking,
experience. Fundamentally, it is cognition that controls our
thoughts and behavior. The six principal domains in
cognitive process include executive function, learning and
memory, perceptual-motor function, language, complex
attention, and social cognition [1]. These processes are
attained either naturally or artiﬁcially, consciously or un-
consciously. Most of the times, they work rapidly even
without realization. The most important physiological
component of cognition is reputed to be neurons that are
connected by synapses. The signal transduction between
these neurons helps in detecting, amplifying, and integrating
various external signals to generate response as cognition.

Signal transduction, cognition, and cognitive
Cognition takes its physiological foundation in the brain
with around 86 billion neurons, each of which is connected
with thousands of other neurons through synapses, forming
a complex circuit. A brain of an individual probably has
more than 100 trillion synapses. Simply, the basis of
cognition lies with processing of information and commu-
nication between these synapses. The neurons communi-
cate via synapses and process the information constantly
and instantly by signal transduction through electrical and
chemical carriers. The excitatory and inhibitory signals
received by dendritic spines of presynaptic neurons get
converged in neuronal stroma. When signal exceeds the
threshold, the generated action potential transmitted down
the axon triggers the release of neurotransmitters at the
synaptic cleft, a small gap between two neurons. Depend-
ing on the nature of the neurotransmitters released, the re-
ceptors to which it binds, and the cell type of (postsynaptic)
neuron receiving the signal, neurons experience either
excitatory or inhibitory activity and hence change in the
behavior occurs.
Cognition development starts right even at the fetal
stage and is unending throughout the lifespan. Each
behavior, each thought, and each move by an individual
decisively depend on the organized ﬂow of electric poten-
tials across the neurons. Any disruption or interference in
neuronal communication at any stage of life could affect the
cognition. Disruption could be anatomical (e.g., brain
injury/damage during accidents), physiological (e.g., lack
of cerebral blood ﬂow), or biological (e.g., formation of
amyloid b-protein). For example, as a basic physiological
process in humans, glutamate, a primary neurotransmitter,
induces excitatory potential by inﬂux of Ca2þ ions into
membrane via NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), AMPA
(a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid),
mGlu (metabotropic glutamate), and kainite receptors,
helping in memory and learning. It also plays a role in
promoting long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic
plasticity, growth cones, and synaptogenesis during neural
development. But disruption of these signals by endoge-
nous or exogenous excitotoxins induces overactivation of
glutamate receptors. Consequently, overload of Ca2þ im-
pulse in the cells leads to the activation of many enzymes
like proteases, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein ki-
nases, phospholipases, endonucleases, nitric oxide syn-
thases triggering the release of free radicals and lipid
peroxidation, cell membrane degradation, and protein lysis,
thereby inducing neuronal damage or death. Ultimately, it
is signal transduction that is responsible for information
processing (cognition) in every individual. This indicates
that neurotransmitters, receptors, action potential/electrical
signals, pre- and postsynaptic events, events in synaptic
cleft
integrated
transduction
contribute to cognition. Changes in cognition are constant
and thereby make the signal transduction also to adapt to
the newer information. But if a persistent difﬁculty is
experienced in organizing the cognitive processes in day-
to-day
tasks,

neurocognitive impairment, which could be attributed to
dysregulation of neuronal signal transduction.
Factors inﬂuencing signal transduction
Neurotransmitters
There are more than 100 neurotransmitters known till date
and still many are being discovered by scientists. Neuro-
transmitters are critical as they carry information (signal)
from one neuron to the other. The various neurotransmitters
that are known to play an important role in cognitive
functions are excitatory and inhibitory amino acids:
glutamate, glycine and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA);
monoamines:
epinephrine,
norepinephrine,
dopamine,
serotonin, histamine, and acetylcholine; neuromodulatory
peptides: calcitonin, hormones like oxytocin, vasopressin,
growth hormone releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing
hormone, somatostatin, gonadotropin releasing hormone,
adrenocorticotropic hormone, neurotensin, neuropeptide-Y
(NPY), neuropeptide-K (NPK), neuropeptide YY, endor-
phins, enkephalin, neurokinin A, neurokinin B, substance
P, and glucagon; and atypical neurotransmitters: nerve
growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
nitric oxide (NO), ATP, cannabinoids, ghrelin, cytokines,
etc. Levels and activation of neurotransmitters are very
critical for signal transduction and to maintain normal
cognitive function. Imbalance of neurotransmitters leads to
neurodegeneration followed by cognitive dysfunction, and
even death. Increased or decreased level of these neuro-
transmitters could be because of at least one of these rea-
sons, viz., amount of neurotransmitters synthesized by
neurons, amount released into synaptic cleft (by exocytosis)
from synaptic vesicles by activation of synaptic vesicle
proteins (e.g., synaptotagmin, Rab3a, proton ATPase and
SNARE proteindsynaptobrevin/vesicle-associated mem-
brane
protein,
syntaxin,
synaptosomal-associated
protein), amount metabolized or deactivated by presynap-
tic enzymes, amount utilized by postsynaptic neurons, or
amount reabsorbed by reuptake mechanism [2].
Signals from neurotransmitters transduce into neurons via
any of the four trends: by binding to (1) ligand gated ion
channels, (2) G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), (3)
enzyme-linked receptor, and (4) by activation of nuclear
transcription factors. Homeostatic regulation of these re-
ceptors/channels is essential to maintain cognition as loss in

control of receptor regulation affect the signal transduction.
Two major factors that alter the regulation of receptors are
receptor density and the function of receptor itself. Alter-
ation in receptor density is caused because of continuous/
surplus stimulation or deprivation of signals by neuro-
transmitters and dysfunction of receptor function is by
alteration of second messenger system [2e4].
Second messenger system
Alteration in second messenger system greatly affects
signal transduction generally via three pathwaysdAdenylyl
cyclase:
cAMP
pathway,
Guanylyl
cyclase:
cGMP
pathway, and Phospholipase C: IP3-DAG pathway. Psy-
chological changes like stress and depression, and envi-
ronmental changes like oxygen deﬁcit and lack of blood
ﬂow, alter the second messenger system. For example,
cerebral ischemia decreases the activation of adenylyl
cyclase leading to Y activation of cAMP / Y binding
activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) /
changes in phosphorylation of DNA-binding transcription
factor, cyclic AMP response element binding protein
(CREB) which plays a critical role in cognition [2,5,6].
G proteins: G-protein coupled with respective receptor
transduces the signal through second messengers via acti-
vation of effector proteins (like adenylyl cyclase and gua-
nylyl cyclase) or opening of ion channels (like inwardly
rectifying Kþ channels [GIRKs]). G proteins are hetero-
trimeric (with a, b, g subunits) or monomeric. Some of the
monomeric G-proteins or small G-proteins that contribute
critical role in signal transduction are Ras, Rab, Rac,
cdC42, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), EF-2, Ran, Rho,
signal recognition particle, etc. The activity of G proteins
is regulated by modulatory proteins like guanine nucleotide
exchange factor that releases GDP and facilitates binding to
GTP, Regulators of G-protein signaling protein that acti-
vates GTPase activity of alpha subunit of G-protein and
phosducin that binds to bg subunits and makes a subunit to
remain active for longer duration [2].
Second messengers: Second messengers help in ampli-
ﬁcation of signals by activating intracellular pathways.
Cyclic nucleotides like cAMP and cGMP, calcium (Ca2þ),
nitric
oxide
(NO),
inositol
triphosphate
(IP3),
diac-
ylglycerol (DAG), arachidonic acid are major secondary
messengers that serve signal transduction. The levels and
the activity of second messengers are regulated by cata-
lyzing effector proteins (adenylyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase,
phospholipase C, etc.), endogenous precursors (ATP, GTP,
PIP2, etc.), cofactors (Mg, Ca), and degrading enzymes
(phosphodiesterases [PDEs]). Diffusion of messengers
from one location to the other also regulates their activity.
In case of ions, expression of ion channels; its storage,
activation, and release from intercellular storage compart-
ments; and cytoplasmic buffering affect the regulation [2].
phosphorylation:
Second
messengers
critical in inducing phosphorylation of many important
elements
neurotransmitter
synthesizing
enzymes,
receptors, voltage gated ion channels, synaptic vesicle
proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and nuclear proteins. The
effects of second messengers are regulated by protein
phosphorylation on serine or threonine residues. Second
messengeredependent phosphorylation involves cAMP-
dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), cGMP-
dependent
(protein
G),
Ca2þ-dependent protein kinases (CaM-kinase, protein ki-
nase C). These protein kinases in turn are regulated by
factors like protein kinase-anchoring proteins (A kinasee
anchoring proteins [AKAPs], receptors for activated C ki-
nase [RACKs]), protein kinase inhibitors, protein serine-
threonine phosphatases (protein phosphatases 1 [PP1],
PP2A). Phosphoproteins generated on phosphorylation
could act as third messengers and produce biological re-
sponses. Recently, these factors have gained more attention
in the therapeutic area of neurodegeneration diseases.
Apart from second messengeredependent phosphory-
lation, the other major phosphorylation cascade involved in
signal
transduction
neurotrophic
factor-dependent
phosphorylation via neurotrophin signaling pathways (the
Ras-Raf-ERK, IRS-PI3-kinase-Akt, and phospholipase Cg
[PLCg] pathway), JAKeSTAT pathway, glial cell linee
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signaling pathway,
cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, glycogen synthase
kinases, casein kinases, and cyclin-dependent kinases.
Factors those regulate these pathways include receptor
dimerization, phosphorylation, activation of transcription
factors, phosphatase inhibitors [2].
Genes and their expression
Signals from synapses that reach the nucleus could alter
gene expression, which plays a key role in long-term
memory, biological rhythm, neuronal and behavioral plas-
ticity, neuronal survival and death, etc. The mechanisms
behind alteration of gene expression include structural
change in chromatin, transcription (DNA to RNA), splicing
(RNA to mRNA), covalent modiﬁcation of mRNA, trans-
lation (mRNA to protein), and modiﬁcation of protein.
Collective factors regulating these processes are protein ac-
tivators, transcription factors (CREB, activator protein AP-1,
signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT, c-Fos,
NF-ƙB), dimerization, or multimerization of transcription
factors, phosphorylation, availability of adapter protein
(binding protein), translocation of transcription factor from
cytoplasm into nucleus, chaperone proteins (Hsp90, Hsp56),
binding of transcription factors to promoter or enhancer re-
gion of gene, histone, modiﬁcation of histone through
acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation,
etc.,
acetyltransferases
(HAT),

deacetylases (HDAC), and RNA polymerase. Malfunction
in these factors interrupts gene expression affecting learning
and memory. Apart from inﬂuencing neurotransmitter levels
directly by acting on transporters and enzymes, recent
research is focused on drugs or nutraceuticals targeting
transcription factors and related proteins that are involved in
gene expression to act as a cognition enhancer and to treat
neurological diseases [2].
Structural factors and neuronal connections
The so far discussed factors that regulate signal trans-
duction
directly
indirectly
depend
upon
morphology itself. The phenomenon of neuronal trans-
mission through neuronal connections deﬁnes the process
of signal transduction. Any damage or modiﬁcation to the
cytoskeleton/organelles of neurons, which regulates the
entire function, greatly affects the signal transduction.
Dendritic spine density, size, dendritic arborization, pre-
and postsynaptic density, and synaptic plasticity (ability of
synapse to increase or decrease its strength of communi-
cation) aid in conducting signals from one neuron to the
other, glial cells help in maintaining extracellular environ-
ment like ion concentration, metabolism of neurotransmit-
ters, microtubules, and the associated proteins like tau play
an important role in signal transduction [2,7].
Cerebral blood ﬂow
Brain consumes more glucose and oxygen from the circu-
lating blood than any other organ in the body, which is
disproportionate to its relative mass of the body (2%).
Blood ﬂow in the brain accounts for 15% of cardiac output
which supplies approximately 20% of total oxygen required
by the body. Human body can lose its complete con-
sciousness on stopping the cerebral blood ﬂow for 10 s.
Interruption in blood ﬂow could severely affect the signal
transduction, hence the impairment in cognition, stroke,
and fatality [2].
Approved drugs as cognition enhancers
There are several categories of drugs that are approved in
various countries to treat cognitive decline. These drugs are
prescribed to improve cognition in mild cognitive impair-
ment, dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, stroke, head injury,
etc. There exist multiple approaches of treatment to
improve cognition. The currently employed one approach
is to improve cognition symptomatically. The mechanism
behind this strategy is either by activating cholinergic
pathway or by blocking the glutamate-NMDA receptors.
The drugs under this approach include choline facilitators
(Anti-choline esterases): tacrine, rivastigmine, donepezil,
galantamine;
NMDA
(glutamate)
receptor
antagonist:
memantine; and miscellaneous group of drugs that include
piracetam, pyritinol, citicoline, dihydroergotoxine, pir-
ibedil, whose mechanisms are not well delineated. All these
drugs are known to work through one of these mechanisms,
viz.,
increases
ﬂow
(CBF),
supports
neuronal metabolism, increases neurotransmission, and
improves cerebral function. There are few other cholinergic
agonists like arecoline, bethanechol, and oxotremorine,
which can clinically improve the symptoms of cognitive
decline but have side effects [2,3].
The other approach is to alter the disease process/
progress itself, which is responsible for cognitive decline.
This strategy has gained extensive attention of researchers
to deal with complicated cognition impairment. Approach
of neuroprotection by antioxidants and antiinﬂammatory
agents is also employed as adjunct approach to prevent
cognitive decline at times of neuronal damage and to pre-
vent further consequent progression of cognitive decline
after neuronal damage [2].
Nutraceuticals for cognitive
In ayurvedic system of medicine, the herbs that enhance
cognition are classiﬁed as Medhya Rasayana. Some of the
important
herbs
under
category
Acorus
calamus, Benincasa hispida, Bacopa monnieri, Celastrus
panniculata, Centella asiatica, Convolvulus pluricaulis,
Glycyrrhiza glabra, Nardostachys jatamansi, and Tino-
spora cordifolia [8].
Apart from these herbs, there are other herbal nutraceut-
icals and phytocomponents that are widely used as cognitive
enhancers. Nicotine and caffeine are widely recognized to
improve aspects of cognitive function like attention [9,10].
Ginkgo biloba was identiﬁed with positive effects on cogni-
tive function in healthy young and elderly volunteers
[11e13], mild cognitively impaired elderly patients [14e16],
patients with AD and other dementias [17,18]. Combination
of Ginkgo biloba and Panax ginseng exhibited improvements
in working and episodic memory [19,20]. Some of the other
important herbs that have been shown to improve cognition
are Panax ginseng [21e23], Melissa ofﬁcinalis [20,24,25],
Rhodiola rosea [26e29], Hypericum perforatum [30], and
Salvia lavandulaefolia [31].
Other phytoactives/metabolites that were found to
improve cognitive function in the young and elderly
include caffeine [10,32,33], acetyl-L-carnitine [34,35],
pyroglutamic acid [36], guanfacine [37], huperzine [38,39],
Ginseng þ vitamins [40,41], alpha lipoic acid [42], phos-
phatidylserine [43], pycnogenol [44], docosahexaenoic acid
[45], essential oils and aromas [46], S-adenosyl-L-methio-
nine [47], citicoline [48e50], and L-theanine [51].

Bacopa monnieri for cognitive
Bacopa monnieri (BM) is traditionally well known for its
activity as cognition enhancer. Scientiﬁcally BM has been
extensively studied both clinically and preclinically to un-
derstand its effects on cognition during nonpathological
pathological
epilepsy,
diabetes,
ischemia, stroke, schizophrenia, and AD.
Clinically BM was demonstrated to improve cognitive
function in various groups of people. BM increased
people
[52e58],
adults
[59e64], in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
[65,66], in subjects with AD [67], in school children [68],
and in college students [69]. BM was also proved to
improve symptoms of learning ability in ADHD children
[70] and in children requiring individual education program
[71].
The possible neuronal molecular mechanisms of BM
behind these clinical outcomes have been studied via
different aspects of signal transduction. In this review the
reported mechanisms of action pertaining to learning and
memory, attention, social cognition, and executive function
are described.
Neuronal molecular mechanisms of
cognitive beneﬁts of BM in relation to
signal transduction
Effect of BM on neurotransmitters
BM has been shown to modulate the level of neurotrans-
mitters that play critical role in cognitive function.
Treatment with BM elevated the level of acetylcholine
[72e74] and serotonin [74e76], and modulated the levels
of dopamine [74,76e78], GABA [74,79], noradrenaline
[76], and glutamate [74]. BM enhanced the level of BDNF
[80e82]. BDNF, a well-known neurotrophic factor, plays
niche role in amplifying the response of neurotransmitters
and enhancing the release of other neurotransmitters and
vesicle docking (bringing synaptic vesicles at the active
zone of a nerve terminal) [83,84].
Enzymes/protein regulating neurotransmitters
Multiple studies have shown that BM regulates the level of
neurotransmitters by acting on the enzymes involved in
their synthesis or degradation. BM inhibited acetylcholin-
esterase (AChE) [85] and enhanced choline acetyltransfer-
ase toward regulating acetylcholine (Ach) levels [80]. The
extracts of BM have been shown to inhibit many other
enzymes, viz., tryptophan hydroxylase that regulates sero-
tonin [75], tyrosine hydroxylase that regulates catechol-
amines [86], glutamic acid decarboxylase that regulates
GABA,
catechol-O-methyl
transferase
regulates
dopamine (DA), and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) that reg-
ulates vasopressin, arginine, oxytocin, substance P, and
angiotensin II [87]. PEP is a serine peptidase that is
responsible for maturation and degradation of peptide
hormones as listed above. Inhibition of PEP has been
shown to improve impaired learning and memory [88,89].
BM has been shown to regulate the level of serotonin by
enhancing the expression of synaptotagmin1, a calcium
sensor protein present on the membrane of synaptic vesicle
that is responsible for exocytosis of neurotransmitter from
the synaptic vesicle to the synaptic cleft [90].
Transporters
Neurotransmitter release/transportation relies upon factors
called
transporters.
Vesicular
glutamate
transporter
(VGLUT) is one such transporter that transports glutamate,
an excitatory neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles, where
they are stored. Reduced VGLUT causes glutamatergic
hypofunction that can cause cognitive dysfunction during
schizophrenia. BM extract was found to increase VGLUT1,
VGLUT2, and VGLUT3 expression in one or more regions
(prefrontal cortex, striatum, and CA1-3 region) of brain,
restoring
deﬁcit
caused
phencyclidine-induced schizophrenia [91e93].
Likewise, BM extract also increased the expression of
serotonin transporter (SERT) during development phase of
learning and memory [75]. Increase in SERT, a transporter
in presynaptic terminal that plays a key role in clearing
excess 5-HT in the synapse back to presynaptic neuron,
greatly regulates the concentration of 5-HT for signal
transmission [94].
Effect of BM on receptors
Effect of BM on receptor density
Cholinergic receptor
BM extract-induced upregulation of muscarinic acetylcho-
line receptor expression (MUS1) that has effect on cogni-
tive performance [72,95,96].
Serotonergic receptors
Contribution of serotonin receptors has been extensively
studied in the process of learning and memory. Decrease in
the receptor expression leads to impaired cognitive func-
tion. BM has been shown to alter the serotonergic (5-HT)
receptor, which is known to play an important role in
learning and memory. BM was demonstrated to upregulate
the expression of 5HT2A, 5HT3A and downregulate 5HT7 in
the rat hippocampus. Decrease in 5HT2A is associated with
cognitive decline in aging, schizophrenia, and AD while
5HT3 is involved in learning, memory, and attention, both

directly and indirectly by activating cholinergic system
[97e99]. Intervention of BM reversed the effects of
impaired cognitive function by upregulating the expression
of 5HT3A. BM through 5HT3A also increased the levels of
5-HT, ACh, GABA, glutamate (Glu), and decreased
dopamine (DA) levels. Interaction of 5HT3A with seroto-
nergic and cholinergic neurons and other neurotransmitters
along with anticholinesterase activity possibly enhances
learning and memory [100e104].
Glutamatergic receptors
AMPA receptors Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to
cause the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction
[105e109]. Diabetes induced oxidative stresseassociated
memory impairment might be due to altered glucose
metabolism and abnormal activation of polyol-sorbitol
pathway in neurons, impaired excitatory glutamatergic
synaptic transmission, and early LTP (eLTP) [110e112].
BM exhibited antidiabetic activity [113] and its mechanism
behind improving DMeassociated memory loss was stud-
ied by Pandey et al. [114]. The study concluded that BM
extract improved spatial memory loss by upregulating
AMPA GluR2 subunit gene expression in CA1 and CA3 of
hippocampus and improving oxidative stress in streptozo-
tocin (STZ)-induced DM type 2 (DM2) mice. GluR2 sub-
unit of AMPA, a glutamate-gated ion channel, was thought
to play a critical role in Ca2þ permeability and receptor
trafﬁcking. This subunit aids AMPA receptor in insertion to
synapse and hence synaptic activation. Also, GluR2 has its
role in maintaining the stability and assembly of AMPA
receptor into the synapse [115]. These facts claim AMPA
GluR2 subunit to be important in synaptic plasticity,
learning, and memory. BM extract is found to decrease the
blood glucose level by reversing the insulin resistance.
Antidiabetic activity of BM along with its effect on AMPA
GluR2 subunit indirectly reveals that it could regularize
glucose metabolism, activation of polyol-sorbitol pathway
in neurons, excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission,
eLTP, and synaptic plasticity [110e112]. BM showing
same activity in nondiseased control group revealed that
BM could exhibit its activity both in pathological and
nonpathological conditions. However, the study failed to
explore whether the GluR2 subunit expression increased by
BM is edited or unedited because Ca2þ permeability de-
pends on unedited GluR2 subunit which is important for
synaptic plasticity [115].
NMDA receptors BM extract has been shown to have its
effect on NMDA receptors (NMDAR) at both the subtypes,
NR2A and NR2B [116]. NR2A and NR2B are known for
neuroprotection and neuronal death, respectively, during
NMDAR activation. Alterations in NR2A/NR2B ratio were
expected to be associated with modulation of LTP and
long-term depression (LDP) functions during synaptic
plasticity in hippocampus [117]. Neuronal nitric oxide
synthase (nNOS), an apoptotic factor via nitric oxide (NO),
activated by NMDAR also plays critical role in NO-cGMP
signaling for cognition. However, excess NO leads to
excitotoxicity. BM extract, especially during thioacetamide
(TAA)-induced hepatic encephalopathy reversed the altered
NR2A/NR2B ratio and normalized the enhanced apoptotic
factors (nNOS and NO) level along with Bcl2/Bax ratio
[116]. Similar effect of BM extract was studied by Rai et al.
and BM extract was found to restore spatial memory by
upregulating NMDA GluN2B subunit in prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus [85].
BM extract was also demonstrated to reverse the
cognitive dysfunction by normalizing the expression of
NMDAR in hippocampus and reducing the glutamate
receptor binding during epilepsy [118] and the expression
in prefrontal cortex and CA1-CA3 during schizophrenia
[93,119].
GABA receptors
Behavioral deﬁcit and spatial memory deﬁcit associated
with decreased GABA receptor in epileptic rats were
reversed by BM extract and bacoside A, by reversing the
decreased GABA receptor to the normal. BM extract
upregulated
decreased
GABAAa1,
GABAAa5, and GABAAd and downregulated the increased
GABAAg5 in hippocampus and cerebellum and likewise
upregulated GABAAa1, GABAAg3, and GABAAd and
downregulated GABAAa5 in striatum [79,120,121]. Though
GABA receptor is a receptor for inhibitory neurotrans-
mitter, there exist some studies that proved GABA re-
ceptors also play a role in enhancing learning and memory
[122,123]. This statement was supported with studies con-
ducted by Mathew et al., where improved cognitive per-
formance was achieved with BM extract by reversing the
decreased levels of GABA receptors [79,120,121].
Effect of BM on second messenger system
PKC: PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
Glutamatergic neurotransmission is reputed to be an
important molecular mechanism for learning and memory
formation via synaptic plasticity-related proteins. A study
conducted by Matsumoto et al. demonstrated that BM
upregulates the phosphorylation of proteins GluR, CaMKII,
and CREB by activating PKC signaling pathway mediated
by glutamatergic neurotransmission. The study revealed
that BM triggers Ca2þ-dependent activation of calmodulin
resulting in phosphorylation of CaMKII, a factor that is
responsible for converting short-term memory to long-term
memory [124]. Mechanistic study conducted by Saraf et al.
also proved that BM demonstrated its antiamnesiac activity
by PKC-CREB pathway involving calmodulin [125].

Similarly, BM extract was demonstrated to protect the
cognitive function during ischemia via PKC:PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway. Treatment with BM extract in ischemia-
associated vascular dementia, nonspatial short-term mem-
ory loss, second most common dementia, induced by
transient 2 vessels occlusion (T2VO) in mice protected the
cognitive function. Also, treatment with bacopaside I,
bacopaside N2, and a mixture of bacopaside II and baco-
saponin D against oxygen and glucose-deprived ischemia
in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures revealed that
bacopaside I was the most potent phytocompound. The
study concluded that contribution of cognitive protective
activity of BM extract was due to more of bacopaside than
the other phytoactives. The same study also indicated that
the neuroprotective activity of BM during ischemia-
associated cognitive dysfunction was because of its inter-
vention in PKC and PI3K/Akt signaling [126].
PKCε is a calcium independent but diacyl glycerol
(DAG)-regulated serine-threonine kinase. PKCε provides
protection from ischemia by regulating many pathways
such as: (1) phosphorylation of the mitochondria KATP
channel [127], (2) increased synaptosomal mitochondrial
respiration, (3) activation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) pathway [128], via NMDAR [129], and (4)
by regulating GABA synapses [130]. However, study
conducted by Le et al. stated that the protective action of
bacopaside I was due to PKCε-mediated activation of
mitochondrial KATP channel (Kir 6.2) and not by ERK. This
activation in turn activates voltage gated calcium channels
that regulate energy metabolism and thereby cell survival
during ischemia [126]. Activity of bacopaside I on energy
mitochondria
ischemia
further
conﬁrmed the investigation of Liu et al. [131], which
claimed treatment in middle cerebral artery occlusion
induced ischemic rats with bacopaside I for 6 days (3 days
pre and posttreatment) increased the levels of ATP, energy
charge, total adenine nucleotides, NO. The same study also
reported that BM increased the activity of Naþ KþATPase
and Ca2þMg2þATPase, the signal transducers, that also
like Kir 6.2 play critical role in generating nerve impulse
and maintaining the resting membrane potential [132].
Bacopaside I also reduced the size of infarct volume and
cerebral edema. Activation of PKCε by BM could also
have protected the hippocampus by maintaining the CBF
during ischemia [130] which was in correlation with the
study conducted by Kamkaew et al. [133]. Accumulation of
Naþ, Ca2þ, Mg2þ during dysfunction of respective pumps
in cells at incidence of neuronal stress, like ischemia,
smoking, neurotoxin exposure, and brain injury, leads to
catastrophic enzyme activation resulting in irreversible
damage to cells. While, pretreatment and posttreatment of
BM extract and bacopaside increased the levels of NaþKþ
pump and Ca2þ, Mg2þATPase protecting the brain and
thereby the memory [134e137].
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway triggered via either GPCR
or tyrosine kinase receptor was considered to play a role in
neuronal cell survival and hence the cognitive function. Akt
activation by PI3K by phosphorylating at Thr308/Ser473
regulates apoptosis by inhibiting apoptotic proteins like
BAD, caspase 9, NF-kB, JNK, GSK3, and enhancing
proteins like CREB [138]. BM has been shown to activate
PI3K/Akt and level of pAkt and thereby regulate apoptosis,
neuron survival, energy metabolism, protein synthesis,
neuronal growth, and LTP potentiation [126,139e141].
Effect of BM on regulation of gene expression
Regulation of reelin-dependent NMDAR-
BDNF expression
Coordination of transcription and translational process is
required for LTP and thereby the long-term memory (LTM)
formation. A study conducted by Preethi et al. elucidated
the mechanism of BM extract in critical steps of reelin-
dependent NMDAR-BDNF expression. BM was found to
exert its effect on (1) Methylation of reelin promoter: BM
extract elevated the levels of unmethylated reelin DNA,
reelin mRNA and decreased the levels of methylated reelin
DNA. The enhanced demethylation was attributed to
enhanced memory [142]; (2) Splicing of ApoER 2 receptor:
BM extract upregulated mRNA expression of ApoER 2 (ex
19) which is very critical for altered reelin to mediate
NMDA receptor activity; (3) Phosphorylation of adapter
protein, disabled 1 (DAB1): BM extract increased the
levels of total DAB1 and p-DAB1, which correspond to the
binding of reelin with ApoER 2 (ex 19). pDAB1 is also
responsible for the action of Src kinase family (SKF) which
phosphorylates NMDAR. (4) Modiﬁcation of protein: BM
extract was found to increase the levels of subunits of
NMDAR, NR2A, and NR2B and thereby NR2A/NR2B
ratio. (5) Interaction of NMDAR subunit with synaptic
proteins: Increased levels of NR2AeSKF and NR2Ae
PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein) showed the interac-
tion of NMDAR and synaptic proteins which activates
NMDAR; (6) NMDA activation on methylation of neuro-
trophic factor promoter: BM extract elevated the levels of
unmethylated BDNF DNA and also mRNA expression of
BDNF showed that interaction of NMDAR was in coor-
dination with transcriptional and translational activity of
BDNF. Thus, BM extract was shown to regulate the gene
expression to enhance LTP and the synaptic plasticity
through reelin-dependent NMDAR-BDNF expression in
support of LTM formation [82].
Regulation of miRNA
The microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as molecular
micromanagers that ﬁne-tune gene expression at post-
transcriptional
phase
[143,144].
miRNAs

## Page 37

argonaute (AGO) forms a silencing complex called miRISC
to regulate the gene expression [145]. The miRNA
expression and cognition with respect to neuronal growth
and synaptic plasticity are inversely proportional, i.e.,
downregulation of miRNA enhances cognition [146]. It
was found that serotonin greatly downregulated these
miRNAs, which in turn enhanced the expression of CREB,
a key component for synaptic plasticity [147]. Interestingly
BM extract enhanced the cognition through miRNA-
mediated CREB cascade by enhancing serotonin level.
Treatment with BM during brain growth spurt (BGS) (3e
4 weeks postnatal life of rats) downregulated the gene
expression of dicer, Ago2, and miR-124 and protein
expression of DICER and AGO2; upregulated the gene
expression of creb1, total and phosphorylated CREB, and
PSD-95 by enhancing 5-HT levels [148]. Reduced dicer,
Ago2, DICER, and AGO2 enhance synaptic plasticity,
learning, and memory by inhibiting the biosynthesis of
miRNAs [145,146,149], whereas, upregulation of synaptic
protein, creb1, and pCREB1 (transcription factors) was
demonstrated to increase LTM formation and increased
expression of PSD-95 proved to regulate architecture of
synapses by contributing to localization of receptors,
clustering of synaptic signaling proteins, and synapse sta-
bilization [150e153].
Gene ontology analysis
A gene ontology analysis based on gene expressions
studied by Leung et al. [154] revealed that BM extract
regulated (1) Biological processes: that include regulation
of protein kinase activity, nervous system development,
oxygen transport, synaptic transmission, cellular calcium
ion homeostasis, transcription, long-term synaptic potenti-
ation, excitatory postsynaptic membrane potential and po-
tassium ion transport; (2) Cellular components: that include
extracellular vesicle, cytoskeletal factors, ribonucleoprotein
complex, cell projection, adherens junction, hemoglobin
complex, axon, synaptic membrane, and dendrite; and (3)
Molecular functions: that include RNA binding, substrate
speciﬁc transporter activity, oxidoreductase activity, tran-
scription factor binding, heme binding, core promoter
binding, transcription core pressor activity, tubulin binding,
NADH
dehydrogenase
chromatin
binding.
Effect of BM on structural factors and neuronal
connections
Synaptic plasticity
LTP is a phenomenon of synaptic plasticity that plays a role
in learning and in formation of LTM by inducing long
lasting signal transmission between pre- and postsynaptic
neurons. BM when measured for its excitatory postsynaptic
potential in hippocampus of rat brain was shown to enhance
LTP magnitude, which revealed the ability of BM to
strengthen the learning-dependent hippocampal synaptic
response [155]. The study was in correlation with the ac-
tivity of BM where increased synaptic plasticity could be
possibly by PKA/ERK-CREB pathway. Enhanced expres-
sion of NMDAR2A and NMDAR2B receptors, phosphor-
ylated ERK, CREB, transcription coactivator (p300),
acetylated histones (H3, H4) and BDNF expression and
downregulated
deacetylases
(HDAC1, HDAC2) and protein phosphatases (PP1a,
PP2A) supported that pathway involved in LTP could be
the PKA/ERK-CREB pathway [155,156]. Additionally, the
effect of BM on synaptic plasticity was conﬁrmed in
another study where BM extract was shown to upregulate
the expression of fmr-1 gene that encodes for Fragile X
mental retardation protein, the mRNA-binding protein that
is present on dendritic spines, and is reputed to contribute
to synaptic plasticity [157,158].
Neuronal density and dendritic arborization
Dendritic arborization is considered to contribute to
cognition enhancement and neuronal plasticity [159,160]. It
has been shown that alteration in dendritic morphology
in hippocampus [161] and amygdaloid [162] are involved
in learning process. BM increased dendritic arborization in
CA3 region of hippocampus [163] and amygdala neurons
[164] thereby increased neuronal plasticity during the phase
of learning. BM also demonstrated to enhance neuronal
density in CA2 and CA3 region of hippocampus, which
was thought to be a reason for cognitive improvement in
schizophrenia-induced rat brain [119].
Beta-amyloid and tau proteins
The extracellular accumulation of the beta-amyloid frag-
ments (called beta-amyloid plaques) and intracellular
accumulation of abnormal form of the protein tau (called
tau tangles) are two of several distinctive brain changes
associated with cognitive decline as in AD. Beta-amyloid
(Ab) plaques are believed to contribute to cell death by
interfering with interneuron communication at synapses,
whereas intracellular toxic protein tau accumulation col-
lapses the stability of microtubules and blocks the transport
of nutrients and other essential molecules inside neurons
[165]. Lack of impairment in the functional activity during
initial stages might be due to compensatory mechanism of
the brain. As neuronal damage increases, the brain can no
longer compensate for the changes and individuals show
subtle cognitive decline. Later, neuronal damage is so
signiﬁcant that individuals show obvious cognitive decline,
including symptoms such as memory loss or cognitive

BM was shown to enhance the neuronal cell viability
against Ab25e35 by neutralizing the induced toxicity [166].
In another study Malishev et al. proved the efﬁcacy of
bacoside A in ameliorating the toxicity of Ab42 by inter-
rupting at membrane interaction level [167]. Consistent to
these studies the other similar studies also proved the ability
of BM in enhancing cognition by mitigating Ab levels
[168e170].
Ternchoocheep et al. proved the efﬁcacy of BM in
attenuating the expression of both total tau and phosphor-
ylated tau in isolated cell system [171].
Effect of BM on CBF
BM has been shown to increase the CBF in rat cerebral
cortex independent of blood pressure. Chronic administra-
tion of BM was demonstrated to improve cognitive func-
tion [172] by increasing quiescent CBF up to 25%
compared with controls, which implied cerebrovascular
dilation [133]. It was hypothesized that the BM acts as a
vasodilator by releasing nitric oxide from the endothelium
and inhibiting calcium ﬂuctuations in and out of the
sarcoplasmic reticulum [173].
Effect of BM as neuroprotective agent
BM as an antioxidant
Brain is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress and free rad-
icals, causing damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids
[174e176]. Role of oxidative stress in relation to disease-
associated cognitive dysfunction was well established in
the past for diseases like AD, Parkinson disease (PD) [177],
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [178], and in conditions like
aging [90,179] and cerebral ischemia [180,181]. BM and its
phytocompounds exerted antioxidant activity by two major
actions: (1) by exhibiting ferrous ion chelation and thus
inhibited further reaction in free radical release [182,183]
and (2) by increasing antioxidant enzymes to counter the
free radicals. Intervention of BM to reduce free radicals by
increasing antioxidative enzymes has been well studied in
protecting the brain and its cognitive function against
oxidative stress and related neuronal damage [90,183e188].
The BM extract was found to demonstrate neuroprotective
activity by exhibiting antioxidant property by reducing lipid
peroxidation in hippocampus during oxidative stress in
diabetic rats. BM was also demonstrated to inhibit poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which could reduce the
generation of free radicals [87]. This was in correlation with
cell-free assay, where BM extract exhibited free radical
scavenging activity that was indicated by inhibition of
DPPH and inhibition of NADH oxidation. Also, BM was
found to exhibit protective effect on DNA cleavage induced
by UV photolysis of H2O2 by suppressing free radical
generation. The same was conﬁrmed with in vitro assay
conducted in human immortalized ﬁbroblast cells where
BM extract was shown to inhibit H2O2-induced DNA
damage greatly up to 65% compared to untreated group and
was also found to inhibit H2O2-induced cytotoxicity [189].
A study conducted in vivo in diabetic rats showed that
BM extract could increase antioxidant defense system by
increasing SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH levels [185]. In
another study, BM extract was shown to increase antioxi-
dant enzyme SOD, CAT and GPx in all three major critical
regions of brain involved in cognitive function, frontal
cortex, hippocampus and striatum [190]. Study conducted
by Shinomol et al. showed that pretreatment with BM
extract in mice administered with 3-nitropropionic acid, a
fungal toxin, completely abolished the elevation of oxida-
tive markers (MDA, H2O2 levels and protein carbonyls) in
striatal region of brain and reduced the depletion of thiols
and glutathione levels. The same effect that was found in
mice was also proved in N27 dopaminergic human cells
[191]. Treatment with BM extract was found to normalize
the depleted levels of SOD levels in diazepam-induced
amnesiac mice [192]. Also BM extract was found to
downregulate expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1
(HIF-1a) in hypoxic condition, which conﬁrmed the acti-
vation of mitochondrial antioxidants and suppression of
mitochondrial ROS system by BM [158,193].
In few studies, the antioxidant activity was attributed to
bacosides [190,194]. However, the holistic dried crude
powder also showed the activity and proved to prevent
DNA damage [191]. By these mechanistic roles in oxida-
tive cycle, BM appears to exhibit neuroprotective activity
over several neuropathological conditions by maintaining
redox homeostasis.
BM as antiapoptotic agent
Bacosides and BM extract have been demonstrated to
exhibit neuroprotective activity against oxidative stresse
associated apoptosis by increasing the levels of cytochrome
c oxidase, ATP, neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM),
g-glutamylcysteine synthetase (g-GCS), and thioredoxin1
(Trx1), and by decreasing chaperon heat shock protein
(Hsp70, Hsp90), cytochrome enzyme activity (CYP450),
caspase-3 activity, and glutamate dehydrogenase activity
[134,194e198]. Also, BM was found to strengthen the
synaptic plasticity and dendritic arborization during oxido-
nitrative stress by countering the apoptotic factors [197].
Additionally, BM extract in a cell-free assay was shown to
inhibit caspase-1, caspase-3, and matrix metalloproteinase-
3, the enzymes that mediate apoptosis cascade [199].
BM as antiinﬂammatory agent

activating apoptotic pathway which could lead to neuronal
death. BM exhibited neuroprotective activity by inhibiting
proinﬂammatory cytokines. BM extract and bacoside A
were found to inhibit the release of TNF-a and interleukin-
6 from activated microglial cells [199]. In correlation with
this study, BM extract was revealed to ameliorate age-
neuroinﬂammation. BM
demonstrated
inhibit proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, along
with iNOS, that were elevated as age increases. Addition-
ally, neuroprotective activity of BM in age-related neuro-
inﬂammation was conﬁrmed by reduction in lipofuscin
accumulation, an aging biomarker. This study proved that
BM could promote healthy brain aging possibly by delay-
ing the age-related cognitive decline [200].
Extensive research has been carried out on BM and vits
phytoactives toward understanding the neuronal molecular
mechanisms involved in cognitive health beneﬁts. To
summarize, the research studies reveal that BM has effects
on major pathways and factors involved in signal trans-
duction underpinning the complex cognitive processes. The
studied preclinical effects of BM on signal transduction can
possibly explain, at least in part, the beneﬁcial effects on
cognition observed in human clinical trials. Moreover, ef-
fect of BM on CBF, balancing neuronal metabolism, and
improving cerebral function by regulating signal trans-
duction, along with its neuroprotective activity, appear to
indicate a holistic effect on brain functions unlike chemical
drugs that work by single mechanism of action. The
existing scientiﬁc evidence strongly substantiates the
traditional use of Bacopa monnieri for cognitive beneﬁts
and justiﬁes its use in dietary and food supplements.

bioactive natural products of herbal origin having putative
roles in brain disorders as neuroprotective and nootropic.
These medicinal herbs are widely practiced in different
regions of India and have been described as neuroprotective
agents. These herbs have been reported to exhibit encour-
aging bioactivities in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenera-
tive
aging.
Common
neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer or Parkinson
disease, which are characterized by progressive loss of
structure and function of neurons or nerve cells. Neurode-
generative diseases are a major cause of disability and
mortality, affecting a huge population worldwide with no
permanent cure, posing a great challenge to the medical
system. This chapter is an attempt to discuss the role of
medicinal
plants
bioactive
phyto-
compounds in the prevention and management of neuro-
degenerative disorders, alongside understanding of their
modes of action.
Methodology
The data was collected from available published informa-
tion in various online sources including PubMed, Sco-
peMed,
ScienceDirect,
Scopus
all
allied
databases, and ofﬁcial publications from the ﬁelds of
pharmacology,
biochemistry,
medicinal
chemistry,
biomedicine, and health. References were also searched
from related and relevant review articles. The search was
focused to probe the roles of Indian medicinal plants in
neurodegenerative brain disorders in light of their ethno-
medicinal uses and contemporary scientiﬁc evidences. The
search combined the terms Ayurveda, Traditional medicine,
Herbal medicine, Indian medicine, Neurodegenerative dis-
ease, Parkinson disease, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease,
and Dementia. This search was undertaken in between July
2019 and February 2020. Searches were limited to the
literature available in English.
Etiopathology of neurodegenerative
Many neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,
such as depression, dementia, Alzheimer disease, schizo-
phrenia, Parkinson disease, neuronal impairment, multiple
system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Hun-
tington disease are predominantly appearing in the current
era due to the stressful lifestyle and other multiple familial,
occupational, or social factors. Key etiologies involved in
neurodegenerative disorders are illustrated in Fig. 4.1.
Common neurodegenerative disorders along with involved
mechanisms and associated physio-biological changes are
stipulated in Table 4.1 [1,2]. Oxidative stress and free
radicals have been associated primarily in the development
of pathophysiology of neurodegenerative changes in brain
tissues. The free radicals generated can trigger multiple
pathological processes such as inducing the formation of
advanced glycation end products, nitration, lipid peroxi-
dation adduction products, and also the carbonyl-modiﬁed
neuroﬁlament protein and free carbonyls, eventually lead-
ing to neuronal death. The pathological involvement of
oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase in degenerative
changes of neuronal tissues is illustrated in Fig. 4.2.
Ayurvedic herbs: traditional usages in
brain disorders
Since ancient times traditional practitioners in India have
been using several herbs to alleviate wide range of psy-
chological ailments; and these herbs are part of these
practitioners’
prescriptions.
Ayurveda,
Rasayana herbs are advocated to to attain long age, healthy
aging, intelligence, youthfulness, ideal strength of psy-
chosomatic tissues and sense organs and enhance intellect
and memory [3]. Aging-related neurodegeneration can be
controlled in a systematic manner with the help of
Rasayana treatment. Many single and compound Rasayana
drugs of Ayurveda possess multifaceted roles like immu-
nomodulation; free radical scavenging; and adaptogenic,
rejuvenating, nootropic, and nutritive effects. Rasayana
herbs are well reported to modulate the neuronal, endo-
crinal, and immune systems. These botanicals serve as a
rich source of active antioxidants; reestablish youthfulness;
enhance and improve recall memory, intellect, and cogni-
tive abilities [4,5]. Comprehensive discussion on these
herbs are beyond the scope of this report; thus, traditional
Ayurvedic treatments including these herbs have been
detailed in Table 4.2 [6].
Role of Indian ayurvedic herbs in
neurodegenerative brain disorders
Except neuropsychiatric disorders of genetic origin, these
traditional herbs have been successfully practiced in

various parts of India to manage several brain disorders.
The herbs belong to distinct botanical families. Some are
wild; some are cultivated; and some of them are herbs,
vines, shrubs, or trees. Most of the herbal treatments
include more than one part of plant and some prescriptions
are given in combination with certain adjuvants or other
herbs. This suggests the synergistic approach of judicious
herbal combinations of the majority of Ayurvedic drug
therapies. Several Ayurvedic herbs which are widely
practiced in Indian traditional system are now validated in
light of scientiﬁc evidences and globally recognized.
There is a long list of promising Indian single herbs that
are proven to be effective in Alzheimer and Parkinson
disease. The active phytocompounds with their possible
mechanism of action are detailed in Table 4.3. Chemical
structures of isolated phytocompounds that are found
effective in neurodegenerative ailments are illustrated in
Figs. 4.3 and 4.4.
A number of Indian medicinal plants are being
explored in recent years with their phytocompounds hav-
ing antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities (Fig. 4.5),
beneﬁcial to manage neurodegenerative changes of brain
[7,8]. Several natural antioxidant biomolecules are iso-
lated from Indian herbs, such as: epigallocatechin gallate
from green tea, resveratrol from grapes, curcumin from
turmeric, chrysotoxine from dendrobium species; man-
giferin and morin, speciﬁcally enriched in fruit, vegeta-
bles, plants such as Mangifera indica; Paeonol from
Paeonia ofﬁcinalis, ursolic acid from Punica granatum,
Duchesnea indica, and Eucalyptus; salidroside from
Rhodiola imbricate, asiaticoside from Centella asiatica,
polydatin from grapes, Biochanin A from botanicals such
as Oroxylum indicum and Cassia ﬁstula, gypenosides
from Gynostemma pentaphyllum, nerolidol from Chry-
santhemum cinerariaefolium, quercetin and kaempferol
from several herbs such as onion, carrot, etc., peonol from
Paeonia
ofﬁcinalis,
hesperetin
naringenin
several citrus fruits, and myricetin from Indian globe
thistle. A number of reports are available ascertaining their
potential roles in managing Parkinson disease through
various mechanisms such as modulating mitochondrial
functions, activating intracellular antioxidants, mediating
metabolism of dopamine, and decreasing iron metal levels
(Fig.4.6) [9]. Few Indian botanicals are also suggested to
have potential role in managing neurodegenerative disor-
ders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington
disease. These are stipulated in Table 4.4 [10].
Based on available reports a schematic representation of
mechanistic pathways for Indian herbal phytocompounds
involved in neuroprotection against Alzheimer and Par-
kinson disease is portrayed in Fig. 4.7. A compendium of
multitargeted mechanisms of action can be postulated based
on published studies. It is observed that external stimulus
binds to Trk receptor activating PI3K/AKT, Ras/MAPK,
and PL-Cg pathways. LPS binds to TLRs activating NF-kB
and JNK signaling. External stimulus releases Nrf2 from

Role of nutraceuticals in the
management of severe traumatic brain
Ramesh Teegala

Traumatic brain injury
Nutritional management in TBI
Herbs and traditional medicines
brain injury (TBI) is deﬁned as a non-
degenerative, noncongenital insult to the brain from an
external mechanical force, possibly leading to permanent or
temporary impairment of cognitive, physical, and psycho-
logical functions, with an associated diminished or altered
state of consciousness [1,2]. TBI is a major global health
problem called as silent epidemic [3,4]. Global incidence of
TBI is estimated to be 500e800 new cases per 100,000
world population [5]. The highest incidence per population
is reported among high income countries like America and
European Union countries. The incidence reporting from
low and middle income countries is not appropriate; hence,
the incidence may appear low compared to high income
countries [6]. With such a high incidence, it remains a
growing health problem causing severe morbidity and
mortality. For clinical evaluation and uniform communi-
cation across all medical fraternity, TBI is classiﬁed with
Glasgow coma score (GCS) scale proposed by Jennette B
and Teasdale GM in 1974 and ranges from 3 to 15 [7].
Three is the lowest and 15 is the highest score and out-
comes depend upon the score; higher the score better the
outcome. According to this scale, TBI can be classiﬁed as
mild (GCS: 13e15), moderate (GCS: 8e12), and severe
(GCS<8).
The pathophysiology of TBI may be broadly divided
into primary and secondary events [8e11]. The manage-
ment of TBI starts from site of injury with a goal to prevent
progression of mild or moderate injury onto severe injury.
Following initial hospital care, residual neurological deﬁ-
cits need multimodal rehabilitation [8].
There is extensive literature on preclinical and clinical
data on the role of nutraceuticals in TBI. They are found to
have a proven role in reducing infections, prolonged ICU
(intensive care unit) stay, and morbidity [12,13].
In this chapter, author brieﬂy discusses the incidence
and pathophysiology of head injury; role of microbiota,
gut, and brain (MGB) axis; functions of different nutra-
ceuticals; and their role in TBI.
Traumatic brain injury
TBI is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
globally; and hence is called as a slow “pandemic” that is
crippling the productive age group. Due to high speed
vehicle accidents, TBI affects the people in this group and
causes major disasters to person, family, and society
[1,2,5,6,11,14e17].
Global incidence of TBI: TBI is increasingly recog-
nized as global health hazard due to its preventability by
many government healthcare systems, medical bodies, and
Nutraceuticals in Brain Health and Beyond. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-820593-8.00005-7

social supporting organizations so that complex medical
and rehabilitative costs can be dramatically reduced. James
[6], in the recent global burden of disease (GBD) meta-
analysis for TBI from 1990 to 2016, found that there is
gradual increase in TBI due to increased number of motor
vehicles and unsafe roads. In another analysis of global
burden, Dewan MC et al. [5] found that each year an
estimated 69 million individuals will suffer from TBI, of
which majority are mild (81%) or moderate (11%) head
injuries. Per capita highest incidence of all TBI was found
in United states/Canada regions (1299) and European
Union region (1012) per 100,000 population. According to
the regional population calculation, overall highest inci-
dence of cases was recorded from Southeast Asian region
(18.3 million) and Western Paciﬁc region (17.3 million).
Mechanism and Pathophysiology of TBI: To under-
stand the targets of treatment and management, it’s very
essential to know the mechanism and pathophysiology of
the TBI. For the ease of readers, authors present a brief note
of this so that the treatment targets will be easily under-
stood. Brain is a unique organ bounded by multiple layers
of brain coverings and cased in a strong cranial bony
cavity. Brain is surrounded by a thin layer of cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) and is suspended by dural bridging veins and
arachnoid bands, thus making it vulnerable to many
mechanical forces and impact (Fig. 5.1) [18,19]. Volume of
cranial cavity is all ﬁxed and ﬁlled with brain, blood and
CSF and maintains its pressure by Monroe-Kellie doctrine
[20e22].
Different forces act on the skull and brain following
head injury. At the site of contact, the impact forces cause
injury. The impulse forces due to head movement can work
on the rest of the brain. The forces generating the impact
could be linear or rotational forces [23].
Road trafﬁc accidents (RTA) are the most common
cause of TBI. Other causes include fall from height (FFH),
sports-related injuries, suicidal and homicidal accidents,
ﬁre arm injuries, combat or warfare injuries [2,14,23,24].
Primary impacterelated injury to the brain may be differ
from civilian injuries in warfare. Warfare is associated with
extensive damage due to multiple explosive effects. Path-
ophysiological
TBI
could
primary or secondary. Primary events predominantly
caused skull fracture, damage to dura and brain matter in
case of open injuries, and local hematoma formation in
closed injuries. These hematomas are classiﬁed based on
their location in relation to brain and its coverings [2].
Hematomas causing neurological deterioration and raised
intracranial pressure (ICP) need surgical evacuation. Small
volume hematomas will be managed conservatively and
with time the hematomas will resolve.
Depending upon the severity of the injury and neuronal
damage, secondary cellular events take place at cellular
level causing cell dysfunction, brain edema, or neuronal
loss.

[23,25e30]:
Unregulated neuronal membrane depolarization and
ﬁring causing the release of excitatory amino acids
like glutamate
Cellular electrolyte imbalance
Dysfunction of oxidative metabolism
Alterations in glucose metabolism and energy depletion
Release of oxygen-free radicals
More than 80% of patients with mild and moderate
head injury have favorable recovery with mild deﬁcits,
whereas severe head injury is invariably associated with
high morbidity and mortality. Hence, the main goal of
head injury management is to prevent the conversion of
mild or moderate head injury patients into severe head
injury group [8,11].
Brain injury simultaneously causes signiﬁcant systemic
changes, which in turn affect the functioning of CNS
(central nervous system). One of the important systemic
changes following TBI is dysfunction of Microbiota Gut
Brain (MGB) axis [31e35].
Microbiota Gut Brain (MGB) axis: In the 19th cen-
tury germ theory of disease was proposed by Louis Pas-
teur and was reﬁned by Robert Koch [36]. Koch
postulated that microorganisms are the source of disease
and further focus on these observations found a subset of
microorganisms enabling the host homeostasis [12]. Nobel
laureate Elie Metchnikoff [37e40] of Pasteur institute,
over 100 years back, proposed the role of these microor-
ganisms like lactic acid bacilli that play a key role in aging
process. Further works by Hubert, Norman, and George
Paster Phillip elaborated the role of these microorganisms
in the Gastrointestinal (GI) system and their inﬂuence on
the host [41]. Based on the recent studies it is proven
clearly that the bidirectional communication pathway be-
tween gut bacteria and brain is called as Microbiota-Gut-
Brain (MGB) axis [31,42e47]. MGB axis exerts a

neuroinﬂammation, neurotransmission, neurogenesis, and

maintaining
crucial
ecosystem. The gut ecosystem helps in the synthesis and
bioconversion of essential nutrients to protect the host
against the pathogen. Variety of neurotransmitters like
Gaba amino butyric acid (GABA), noradrenaline (NE),
dopamine (DA), short chain fatty acids (SCFA) from gut
inﬂuence the CNS through the vagal nerve pathway,
serotonin, and tryptophan metabolites (Fig. 5.2) [48]. Few
studies recently demonstrated that the concept of brain
sterile environment is no more correct and proposed there
are many commensals and pathogens harbored in the brain
in dormant stage. Whenever there is any insult to the
brain, they became virulent and disturb the brain equi-
librium and MGB axis. Noris LC [49] explained it as
“Beehive theory.”
Beehive theory: The concept of beehive theory as
explained by Noris [49] is that the microorganisms within
the brain and or elsewhere in the body may contribute to the
late onset brain insult following traumatic brain injury
[50,51], something like the tranquil beehive, which main-
tains harmony between bees and hive until any eternal
disturbance. Once they get disturbed by any source, the
bees ﬂy out and attack the offenders. Similarly, these
microorganisms maintain an equilibrium with normal brain.
On injury to brain, they become virulent and exert toxic
effects on the brain (Fig. 5.3).
Treatment targets and role of nutraceuticals in TBI:
Nowadays, with the improved training and standards of
paramedical and ambulance staff, treatment of head injured
patient starts from the site of the injury. This is called the
concept of “Golden Hour” with the sole aim to prevent all
possible complications and reduce the conversion of mild
or moderate head injury into severe head injury [52,53].
The management guidelines, in hospital treatment of the
severe brain injury patients, are out of the scope of this
chapter. For the ease of understanding, basic treatment
targets are illustrated in Table 5.1. The relevant treatment
targets of this chapter are discussed as following.
Nutraceuticals in TBI: The term nutraceutical is
derived from nutrition and pharmaceutical by Stephen
DeFelice in 1989 [54e63]. He deﬁned nutraceuticals “as a
food or part of food that provide medical or health beneﬁt,
including prevention and or treatment of a disease other
than anemia.” The food sources used in nutraceuticals are
all natural and can be categorized broadly as potential or
established nutraceuticals. Established nutraceuticals are
the ones whose clinical beneﬁts are established. Most of the
nutraceuticals in common use are potential nutraceuticals.
Broadly the nutraceuticals can be grouped as the following
depending on their properties.
1. Dietary Fiber
2. Probiotics
3. Prebiotics
4. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PFA)
5. Vitamins/Antioxidants
6. Polyphenols
7. Spices
The relevant nutraceutical products or nutrients having
role in TBI are discussed here.

Nutritional management in TBI
“Let food be thy medicine and medicine thy food” quoted
by Hippocrates nearly 2500 years ago is the main tenet of
today [64]. With emergence of new natural products on
regular basis in the market, the difference between food and
drugs is fading [56,63]. Nutrition and supplements are
viable treatment options to reduce the secondary effects of
TBI [32,65e67]. TBI, especially severe head injury, tends
to be associated with hypermetabolism and hypercatabo-
lism resulting in negative nitrogen balance, which may
exceed 30 gm/day [68e74]. Enteral feeding is to be started
as early as possible once the patient is hemodynamically
stable. The goal is to maintain nonprotein calorie intake of
30e35 kcal/kg/day and protein intake of 2e2.5 g/kg/day. If
the circumstances are unfavorable for enteral feeds in the
initial 3 days, one should start the parenteral feeds. Severe
head injury is a stressful condition and is associated with
hyperglycemic state. Blood sugar levels are to be kept
between 150 and 200 mg/dL. Resting energy expenditure
(REE) in this hypercatabolic state is very high in compar-
ison to the basal energy expenditure (BEE) [75e77]. REE
is nearly 38%  37% higher than the BEE, and in some

circumstances, it can increase up to 70% especially with
associated infections. Increased energy expenditure corre-
sponds with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) [78e81]. The
energy expenditure and nitrogen balance can be evaluated
by urinary urea nitrogen once or twice a week or daily urine
creatinine. Normal daily urine creatinine levels range
between 1200 and 1500 mg. In severe head injury it may
reduce to 600 mg/day and in case of sepsis it even further
reduces to 300e400 mg/day.
The positive nitrogen balance can be maintained by
branched chain amino acids (BCAA) [82e85]. Other
nutrients which maintain the nitrogen balance are arginine,
glutamine, and growth hormone (GH) [86e91].
Nutrients like insulinlike growth factor 1 (ILGF-1),
zinc, ribonucleic acids (RNAs), omega 3 (u 3) fatty acids,
glutamine have beneﬁcial effects on immunity and are
called as immune enhancing nutrients [92e94]. These
nutrients help in restoring the normal gut permeability and
MGB axis in patients with head injury.
Few other dietary supplements like curcumin, sulfo-
raphane, and resveratrol are also known to show some
improvement in experimental animals with TBI [95e97].
Curcumin normalized the elevated levels of brain-derived
natriuretic factor (BDNF) levels, and showed improve-
ment in motor and memory functions in experimental
animals exposed to TBI. Sulforaphane improves disturbed
blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Resveratrol reduces
the reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppresses excitotox-
icity, and reduces inﬂammation in controlled impact
TBI models. Resveratrol also reduced lipid peroxidation.
Glutathione and edaravone are shown to have some
clinical improvement as free radical scavengers. Due to
their short half-life, their bioavailability is limited. Lipoic
acid, another free radical scavenger and a lipid peroxidase
inhibitor having long half-life, stabilizes neural cell
membrane, reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate
(NADPH)-induced
improves behavior following head injury [98].
Vitamins/Minerals: Vitamins are nutrients that are
required for normal physiological functioning of human
body. Many vitamins play a crucial role in brain in a
variety of CNS processes. Vitamins E (a-tocopherol), C,
and D and a water-soluble vitamin like nicotinamide (B3)
showed improvement in TBI patients [99,100]. Vitamin E
is a membrane targeted scavenger of lipid peroxyl radicals
and protects cells from oxidative injury and improved
learning and memory in preclinical TBI conditions. In
experimental animals, vitamin D deﬁciency showed poor
outcome after TBI. Vitamin D along with progesterone
was shown to reduce neuronal inﬂammation and cell death
in model of TBI. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) donates
hydrogen atoms to lipid radicals and removes the oxygen-
free radicals to reduce the oxidative stresseinduced cell
damage. Due to their limited isolated effect in clinical
conditions, most of the vitamins are used as adjuvant
agents with other medicines and nutrients.
Minerals like zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg) are
shown to improve recovery following TBI mostly in
preclinical conditions. Zinc, a cofactor in superoxide
dismutase reduces the oxidative stress, inﬂammation,
autophagy, and apoptosis in rodent models. It is also
effective in metabolism, immune system, wound healing,
and membrane stability. It helps in maintaining synaptic
stability. Young et al. [101] randomized 68 patients of TBI
with standard zinc and supplemental zinc, and found that
there is signiﬁcant reduction in mortality in supplemental
zinc group (26 vs. 12). They also observed that there is
improvement in GCS score in severe TBI cases. Magne-
sium was shown to protect against neurological deﬁcits
following TBI by its effects on cellular processes, such as
glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and synthesis of
DNA, RNA, and proteins. Mg is an integral part of
ATPase enzyme reactions. Mg blocks glutamine-mediated
neurotoxicity.
Omega 3 fatty acids: Omega 3 fatty acids are poly-
unsaturated fats found in both plants and ﬁsh. They play a
crucial role in CNS, providing substrates for neuronal
membrane phospholipids, modulating neurotransmission,
protecting cells from oxidative stress, and inﬂammation
through metabolites [100]. These acids increase the con-
centration of BDNF to facilitate the neuromodulator
function. This mechanism reduces the oxidative stress and
prevents
degradation.
strong
antiin-
ﬂammatory function actively reduces the inﬂammatory
mediators like TNF-f, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
also clears the neutrophils. Few studies found that,
supplementation with omega fatty acids prior to injury
showed improved mitotic ability and learning [102e104].
Despite wide spectrum of the mechanism and postulated
beneﬁts in CNS, clinical trials did not show encouraging
results in TBI-associated morbidity and mortality.
Probiotics: Probiotics are live microorganisms with
health enhancing effects. They limit the mucosal barrier
dysfunction, reduce the infection and regulate the balance
of CD4þ effector T lymphocytes causing the immuno-
modulation [42,105e111]. Probiotics generally includes
lactobacilli, gram positive cocci, and biﬁdobacterial group
of bacterial organisms. Probiotics are available in various
forms like powder, liquid, gel, paste, granule, or capsule.
TBI-induced dysbiosis enhances lot of secondary cellular
events in brain as well as gut. Current literature is lacking
with class 1 evidence of probiotics in TBI. However there
are many ongoing preclinical and clinical trials to check
the efﬁcacy [44].

Herbs and traditional medicines
Lots of herbal medicines were used based on ethnic and
cultural beliefs across the world. Lots of recent literatures
are trying to ﬁnd the evidence base of these products. There
are few studies which evaluated the role of these herbs in
TBI with limited usefulness.
Ginseng: It’s a traditional Chinese herb used from the
ages. It’s a plant with many bioactive ingredients. Saponins
are primary class of chemicals and the ginsenosides are
important ones among this class. Ginseng is a potent
antiinﬂammatory agent used in different other medical
conditions like inﬂuenza, cancer, and impaired cognition
[112e115]. In experimental studies on TBI, ginseng was
shown to improve the cognition, motor, and behavioral
function in a dose-dependent manner at 200 mg/kg dose.
These studies also found the histopathological improve-
ment, reduced proinﬂammatory markers, decreased cell
loss, and reduced apoptosis. In summary, these active
saponins have antiinﬂammatory and antioxidant properties
in preclinical studies.
Gingko biloba: It’s a leaf extract used as medicinal
product since centuries. The bioactive extracts contain
ﬂavonoids and ginkgolides. It has not shown any use in
acute TBI; however, it is used in other chronic post-
encephalopathy
disease [116]. In experimental studies Gingko biloba
extracts demonstrated improvements in cognition and
memory, neuronal cell loss, and reduced apoptosis.
Flavonoids: These are plant metabolites arising from
multiple dietary sources like fruits, vegetables, teas, and
wine. They are primarily antioxidant agents and reduce the
free radicals from the tissues. Because of these properties
they are used in multiple disorders like cerebral disorders,
cardiovascular stroke, diabetes, and cancer [117]. With the
encouraging results of the properties, they were also tried in
TBI. Enzogenol a bark extract containing multiple ﬂavo-
noids is deemed safe and is in clinical trials [118]. Another
extract luteolin proved effective in reducing the markers of
oxidative stress, apoptosis, inﬂammation, and cerebral
edema [119e121]. Quercetin, pycnogenol, and wagonin
are some other ﬂavonoids which showed similar results in
preclinical studies [100].
Evidence base on the role of nutraceuticals in TBI:
Brenner LA et al. [122] did an extensive review and
analyzed 8781 articles on role of nutraceuticals in TBI and
posttraumatic psychological disorders. They found four
articles comparing the results of nutraceuticals in TBI.
Among these four studies, two are randomized controlled
trials (RCT), one is retrospective cohort study, and the last
one is before and after comparative study. One of the
RTC reported from China by Tan and colleagues [107]
randomized 52 patients and started enteral nutrition
within 48 h. Half of these patients were randomized to be
supplemented with probiotics containing 0.5  108 Biﬁ-
dobacterium longus, 0.5  107 Lactobacillus bulgarius,
and 0.5  107 Streptococcus thermophilus. They found
that control group who did not receive the probiotics had
more infection (76.9% vs. 14.3%) and prolonged ICU
stay.
Another RCT from Brazil by Falcao de Arruda IS et al.
[110] randomized 23 patients to receive standard diet
fortiﬁed with 30 g Glutamine and 240 mL probiotics
enriched fermented milk with Lactobacillus johnsonii.
Results showed increased infection rates, longer ICU stay,
and more days on mechanical ventilator in control group.
In a retrospective study by Painter TJ et al. [123] from
Cedars-Sinai Medical University from LA, CA, USA, 240
patients were evaluated, who received either standard
isonitrogenous nutrition formula (SF: 1.2 g of Nutraﬂora
soluble short -chain fructooligosaccharide scFOS 8 fL oz:
5 g/L) and immune enhancing nutrition (IEN) formula
(1.8 g of Nutraﬂora soluble short-chain fructooligo-
saccharide scFOS 8 fL oz: 7.5 g/L). In both formulas they
included prebiotic soluble ﬁbers. Results suggested both
the groups had similar hospital stay; however, IEN group
had more days on ventilator and long ICU stay. Gocan AG
et al. [124] evaluated 10 participants before and after with
probiotic enriched food in combat-related posttraumatic
stress disorder patients. They consumed 120 mL of fer-
mented soy formulation daily for 3 months, and it was
found that all of them experienced reduction in anxiety,
detachment, general infections, headache, loss of appetite,
gastrointestinal (GI) burning, and upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI). Other studies also observed similar
results with nutraceuticals; however, none of them are of
class 1 evidence and lack of well-designed studies limits
their use as isolated neuroprotectors [13,56].
As per the current research, there is no effective cure for
TBI or regenerative potential of brain following injury.
With recent advances and onsite and in hospital manage-
ment, there is signiﬁcant reduction in overall morbidity and
mortality of minor and moderate head injury patients. A
good number of survivors of severe head injury have long-
term residual morbidity and need long-term management
with different rehabilitative measures. Acute management
of these cases includes advanced critical care and surgical
intervention. To prevent long-term complications TBI
patients require timely intervention, ICU management, and
adequate nutritional supplements. Nutraceuticals in com-
bination with other agents have a proven beneﬁt in the
recovery of TBI. There are no class 1 studies to prove the
efﬁcacy of nutraceuticals in the dedicated management of

head injury; however, there are class II or III evidences to
prove their role in the overall management of traumatic
brain injury. It needs further research to narrow down the
role of effective single products to prevent the chronic
posttraumatic encephalomalacia.

The aging population
The world is currently undergoing an unprecedented pop-
ulation aging. For the ﬁrst time in history, older adults aged
65 years or over now outnumber children under the age of
5, and are projected to outnumber adolescents and youth
aged 15e24 by the year 2050 [1]. It is estimated that the
number of adults aged over 60 years have more than
doubled since 1980, at almost 1 billion people, and that this
number is projected to double again by 2050 [2]. In
Australia alone, the proportion of the population aged over
65 years has grown consistently over the past two decades,
now making up almost 16% of Australia’s total population.
In 1911 only 4% of Australian citizens fell into this age
bracket, and these data are similar in other Western
countries [3].

This global phenomenon can be largely explained by an
increase in life expectancy, due to higher standards of
living and better-quality healthcare [1]. Unfortunately, with
an increase in life expectancy has come a proportionate
increase in age-associated health problems, such as car-
diovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease, as well as
impairments in cognitive function. Older individuals often
experience deterioration in attention, memory, and pro-
cessing speed [4], impairments that may be accompanied
by a loss of independence and poorer quality of life [5,6].
The incidence of neurodegenerative disorders is also on
the rise. The prevalence of dementia is at a record high,
with an estimate of 50 million people globally living with
the condition, a ﬁgure which has been predicted to double
every 20 years [7]. The burden of dementia is multifaceted,
impacting not only the individual, but also their family and
caregivers, both emotionally and ﬁnancially. The global
economic burden of dementia is estimated at US$1 trillion
a year [7], largely attributable to the growing demand on
public healthcare services. With such high socioeconomic
burden, early detection and prevention of dementia is crit-
ical.
Understanding
what
constitutes
“normal”
age-
associated cognitive decline is therefore imperative. By
identifying the speciﬁc processes that lead to cognitive
decline, potential interventions can be identiﬁed to target
these mechanisms and protect cognitive function in aging
individuals.
What is cognitive aging?
There is great variation in individual age-associated
cognitive decline; however, “normal” cognitive aging is
typically characterized by impairments in cognitive pro-
cesses such as reasoning and decision-making, spatial
abilities, processing speed, and executive function, which
progressively worsen with increasing age. Memory has
been shown to be affected in studies of cognitive aging [8];
however Salthouse [9] argues that age-cognition associa-
tions may be somewhat obscured by practice and test
experience effects. In his study, modest decline in memory
and reasoning abilities was evident at a younger age (below
65) followed by an accelerated decline after age 65; while
decline in speed was almost linear from the 30s onwards.
Beyond 50 years of age there is a notable acceleration in
the decline of cognitive performance, which parallels the
reduced performance of other body systems [10]. Age-
deﬁcits
accompanied
shrinkage, such that both gray and white matter are reduced
along with an enlargement of the cerebral ventricles [11].
Gray matter shrinkage appears to be most prominent in the
temporal and frontal lobes, as evidenced in longitudinal
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies [12].
Cognitive aging is commonly conceptualized in terms
of crystallized and ﬂuid intelligence [13,14]. Crystallized
cognitive abilities, which include verbal and general
knowledge, improve with life experience until stabilizing at
around 60 years of age, and remain intact until late aging.
Conversely, ﬂuid-cognitive abilities are variable throughout
the lifespan, and characteristically start to decline after the
ﬁrst two decades of life [9,15], and more rapidly from age
60 [8]. These ﬂuid-cognitive processes are more complex,
involving executive function, conceptual reasoning, prob-
lem solving, learning, and memory. Interestingly, the rate
and severity of decline in these abilities are not homoge-
neous, with some individuals only experiencing subtle
cognitive changes, while others become signiﬁcantly
impaired or progress on to develop dementia. It is the
interindividual
intraindividual
variability
age-
fundamental
providing insights into the underlying pathophysiological
mechanisms of cognitive aging and dementia.
What are the biological factors
inﬂuencing cognitive aging?
The biological mechanisms underlying cognitive aging are
not yet fully understood due to their complexity; however,
there are a number of factors that have been identiﬁed as
potential contributors. These include cerebrovascular dis-
ease, mitochondrial dysfunction, impairments to neuronal
signaling and activity, inﬂammation, reduced antioxidant
capacity, and oxidative stress. These mechanisms may be
interdependent and interactive; therefore, it is unlikely that
any of them inﬂuence cognition in isolation.
Cerebrovascular disease is common in the elderly and is
known to contribute to cognitive aging. Numerous studies
have demonstrated a relationship between cerebrovascular
abnormalities and risk of dementia. Stroke is known to
increase the risk of developing both vascular dementia and
Alzheimer disease (AD) [16,17], and brain infarcts have
been linked to dementia through both postmortem in-
vestigations [18] and MRI comparisons of patients with AD
and controls without dementia [19e21].
The use of antihypertensive medication has also been
shown to decrease the risk of cognitive decline and de-
mentia. Treatment with perindopril with or without inda-
pamide was associated with improved cognitive outcomes
compared to placebo after an average follow-up of 3.9
years [12]. However, the ﬁndings largely reﬂected reduced
risk of dementia and cognitive decline associated with
recurrent stroke, suggesting that stroke prevention was the
underlying cause of beneﬁt rather than a direct effect on
cognition.
Mitochondria are essential for neuronal functioning, as
they generate the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required
for energy production to support neurotransmission, cell
maintenance, and repair [10]. Mitochondrial changes

## Page 74

associated with aging are numerous, including enlargement
or fragmentation, impaired calcium ion (Ca2þ) handling,
and impaired function of the electron transport chain [10].
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked with neurode-
generative diseases in various research paradigms including
in vivo animal studies, studies of mitochondria levels in
patients, postmortem and neuroimaging studies [22].
Impaired autophagy and proteasomal degradation have
also been implicated in cognitive aging as damaged and
dysfunctional molecules are less efﬁciently removed from
the neuron [10]. This can result in accumulation of unde-
graded damaged molecules and ultimately lead to cell
death. Evidence from aging rats suggests that some brain
regions, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex,
crucial regions for memory and cognition, are more
affected than others such as the brain stem and cerebellum
[23]. Enhancing autophagy through inhibition of lysosomal
hydrolases has been shown to ameliorate learning and
memory deﬁcits in a mouse model of AD [24].
The default mode network (DMN) includes the pre-
cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex,
and angular gyrus, and is the network of neurons that is
active when an individual closes their eyes and ceases
interacting with their environment. The DMN is thought to
be important in remembering the past and thinking about
the future. In normal aging, functional connectivity of the
DMN is reduced, and this impairment is intensiﬁed in
cognitively impaired elderly participants [25,26]. DMN
functional connectivity correlates with memory ability
during a memory task in older adults [27].
The focus of this chapter is on oxidative stress and
antioxidants; therefore, the following sections will consider
these mechanisms in more detail.
Reactive oxygen species
During normal metabolic processes, mitochondria play an
essential physiological role in supplying energy for optimal
cellular function [28,29]. Metabolism involves various
reductive-oxidation (redox) reactions where the removal
(oxidation) or addition (reduction) of an electron occurs in
order to maintain molecular homeostasis. Oxygen mole-
cules with one or more unpaired electrons are referred to as
reactive oxygen species (ROS) or oxidants; these are
formed normally in small amounts in the mitochondrial-
based aerobic phases of cellular respiration [30]. In these
metabolic reactions, molecular oxygen is used to generate
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate
(ADP), a process known as oxidative phosphorylation.
Through these reactions ROS such as superoxide anions
(O2
) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical
are produced. ROS originate from the electron transport
chain in mitochondria, especially from complexes I and III.
Approximately 1%e2% of oxygen consumed in oxidative
respiration is converted to ROS.
In addition, ROS, predominantly superoxide can be
generated when cells react to pathogen invasion as a cell
defense mechanism, which leads to propagation of other
free radicals. In the cytoplasm many proteins such as
NADPH oxidase enzyme and xanthine oxidases have been
identiﬁed as producers of ROS [31,32]. Via activation of
these enzymes, superoxide anions are formed. Then the
two-step antioxidant pathway involves the conversion of
O2
 to H2O2 by the superoxide dismutases (SOD) in a ﬁrst
step, and by GPx and/or catalase to water in a second step.
The hydroxyl radical (OH,) is formed as the third-
generation radical derived from H2O2, in the presence of
transition metals via Fenton-type reactions [33]. ROS are
also produced when proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as
tumor necrosis factor, interleukin, or interferon, changes in
signal transduction pathway.
Primarily regarded as the defending molecules for
destroying exogenous pathogens, ROS are now increas-
ingly being appreciated as playing an important role in
cellular signaling and regulation. ROS modify the cell-
signaling proteins and kinase and proteasome systems,
which successively mediate physiological and pathophysi-
ological processes.
For example, exercise training induces marked remod-
eling of the vasculature [34]. There is now strong evidence
that physiological ROS such as H2O2 are involved in this
process [35]. On the other hand, ROS generated by a
pro-oxidant diabetic milieu are believed to contribute to
diabetic
complications
atherosclerosis
[36].
Oxidation of LDL and other lipids is well accepted as a key
factor required for the initiation of atherosclerosis.
ROS have been observed modifying the ion channels
and transporters. For instance, ROS signal initiates changes
of intracellular Ca2þ in a number of cell types. It has been
shown that H2O2 induces a rapid increase in [Ca2þ]i from
sarcoplasmic reticulum followed by a slower increase in
[Ca2þ]i derived from the extracellular space [37].
Accumulated evidences suggest that ROS, as novel
signal mediators, are also involved in cell differentiation
and progression, and play a role in determination of cell
death [38].
Because of the presence of unpaired electrons, ROS
such as superoxide anion (O2) and hydroxyl radicals
($OH) are highly reactive. Derivatives of oxygen without
unpaired electrons, e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are
also capable of initiating oxidation through reaction with
transition metals to generate the reactive hydroxyl radical.
The hydroxyl radical, whose reactivity is very high, reacts
close to its site of formation, whereas other species, such as
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are less reactive, which
can diffuse in the microenvironment and even across cell

membranes [39]. ROS have the capacity to damage many
cellular components such as membrane lipid, proteins, and
DNA, contributing to pathological change in disease states
[40], neurodegeneration, and possibly, aging [41].
ROS play an important role in normal cellular metabolism
where they function as cellular signaling molecules in
mediating physiological processes. In diseased states they
mediate defense against a broad range of pathogens.
However, when ROS are produced in excess they can have
detrimental effects on function and structure of cells, a state
known as oxidative stress. Oxidative stress in the body
represents an imbalance between the production and decay
of ROS and the ability of the antioxidant defense mecha-
nisms to counteract or detoxify the reactive intermediates.
While a basal level of ROS is necessary for basic cellular
processes and viability, surplus production of these ROS
results in the destruction of lipid, proteins, and even DNA,
which can lead to cellular damage and disease.
ROS can target any component of the cell, generally
react with the ﬁrst structure they encounter, frequently the
lipid components of cells or organelle membranes, leading
to lysis and disruption of cellular integrity. Proteins are
vulnerable to ROS-induced denaturation. Metal-catalyzed
protein oxidation results in addition of carbonyl groups or
cross-linking, fragmentation of proteins, which results in
the subsequent loss of cellular functions, and even cell
growth, division, and repair [42]. Superoxide, hydroxyl,
and other oxidants also directly target nucleic acids causing
base hydroxylation, cross-linking, or scission of DNA
strands that can result in mutation [42]. The greater the
oxidative stress, the more severe the resulting cellular
damage; moderate oxidation can trigger apoptosis, more
intense stress may cause necrosis. Oxidative stress is
believed to be a critical factor in normal aging and in
neurodegenerative diseases such as PD, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, and AD.
Antioxidant defenses
To protect against the damaging effects of ROS, the body
has developed inbuilt defense mechanisms comprised of
endogenous antioxidants to counteract the destructive ef-
fects of oxidants and maintain optimal health [29,30]. In
order to reach a level of cellular homeostasis or “redox
equilibrium,” various intrinsic defense systems involving
enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways with protective and
repair mechanisms are involved (Table 6.1) [29,30].
Perhaps the most intensively studied cellular antioxi-
dants are enzymes including SOD, catalase (CAT), gluta-
thione peroxidases (GPxs), and thioredoxin reductase (Trx).
These enzymes located in cells and bodily ﬂuids work
together to prevent oxidative damage by limiting ROS
levels. As part of the antioxidant pathway, SOD accelerates
the conversion of superoxide to H2O2 in a ﬁrst step; while
catalase and GPx convert H2O2 to oxygen and water in the
second step of the pathway (Fig. 6.2) [43,44]. SOD and
GPx have antioxidative functions in different intracellular
components, such as cytosol, mitochondria, and the nu-
cleus, or in the plasma [45]. Furthermore, nonenzymatic
antioxidants such as phenolic compounds, vitamin C
(ascorbic acid), vitamin E (a-tocopherol), and glutathione
confer protection by intercepting and converting oxidants
to nonradical end products or transferring radicals to areas
where their damaging effects will be less detrimental
(e.g., from a hydrophobic to an aqueous phase) [30]. The
glutathione redox cycle, for instance, breaks the chain of
reactions which form reactive species by lowering H2O2
levels and in turn lowering hydroxyl radical formation [28].
Endogenous antioxidant defense systems are also
involved in repairing and removing damaged biomolecules
before they accumulate and result in altered cell function
and permanent damage [46]. Scavenging and clearance of
excess ROS and maintaining a functional oxidant level is
achieved by ﬁnely regulated ROS production and anti-
oxidative defense system (Fig. 6.1).
Oxidative stress in aging and disease
Oxidative stress has long been recognized as playing a
pivotal role in the aging process. The “free radial theory of
aging” was ﬁrst proposed in the 1950s by Harman, and
suggests that free radical-mediated damage builds up in the
body over time as a result of normal metabolic processes
and causes progressive cellular damage and cell death, the
hallmarks of the aging process [47]. A number of studies
revealed changes of endogenous metabolites, inﬂammatory
and oxidative stress markers with age. Rosenfeldt et al.
measured ROS-derived hydroperoxides, as an indicator of
ROS production, by using the diacron reactive oxygen
metabolites (d-ROMs) test, and found that these serum
markers of oxidative stress increased with age, from 265
(229e307 [95 C.I]) Carr Units in young participants, to
289 (263e338) C.U. in the middle-age group to 341
(319e400) C.U. in the old-age group [48].
Oxidative stress is involved in many disease processes,
such as renal failure, myocardial infarction, heart failure,
and sickle cell disease. Oxidative stress is implicated in a
number of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD, multiple
sclerosis, AD, and in psychiatric diseases such as schizo-
phrenia [41].
The signiﬁcant connection between inﬂammation and
oxidative stress has received great interest recently for its
potential role in the pathogenesis and progression of dis-
ease. Often inﬂammatory and antiinﬂammatory agents, as
well as oxidative stress and antioxidants work together in a


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 76

harmonious cycle to restore health in the body as well as to
destroy damaged cells [49]. During an initial inﬂammatory
response, the formation of highly reactive superoxide an-
ions and NO is triggered by immune cell-mediators such as
interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a).
Furthermore, when tissue is damaged, ROS triggers the
release of inﬂammatory signaling molecules such as IL-1
and TNF-a during the acute (e.g., C-reactive protein;
CRP) and chronic phases of injury [29,49]. In disease states
proinﬂammatory risk factors, such as smoking, trigger
proinﬂammatory and acute cytokines, which in turn
generate ROS through the activation of enzymes such as
NAD(P)H oxidases (the NOX family of enzymes).
Oxidative stress and cognition
The imbalance between free radicals, ROS, and antioxi-
dants in the body leads to cellular damage including in
neuronal cells [50]. Several factors render the brain more
susceptible to oxidative injury from free radicals and ROS
than other organs: (1) human neurons contain high numbers
of mitochondria, producing high levels of ROS and free
radicals during oxidative phosphorylation; (2) the brain has
a disproportionately high metabolic rate and requires more
oxygen than other organs; and (3) the brain is well supplied
with unsaturated fats, which are particularly vulnerable to
peroxidation
[51].

oxidative stress is further intensiﬁed by the imbalance
between pro-oxidants, which are fairly abundant in the
brain, and levels of antioxidants which are less plentiful
[52]. In the aging brain, increased free radical proliferation
and reduced antioxidant levels further exacerbate the
brain’s susceptibility to oxidative stress [53]. It has been
well documented that oxidative stress in the brain increases
with age, and that oxidative damage is increased in AD
brains (see Ref. [6] for a review).
It has been shown that some of the maintenance func-
tions of the antioxidant defense systems become deﬁcient
in senescent cells. The impaired repair and clearance
functions of the antioxidants make signiﬁcant contributions
to age-related neurodegeneration. The age-related oxidative
changes are most prominent in neurons because they are
nonproliferating cells and lack the restructure capacity
through cell division.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in neurodegener-
ative disease states such as mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and AD [54e58], and has been associated with
cognitive dysfunction in these disease states as well as
during normal aging [55]. Oxidative stress markers in the
brain, such as DNA, protein, and lipid peroxidation, have
been found to be increased in the brains of AD patients
compared with healthy controls [6]. To investigate whether
oxidative stress precedes AD pathology or whether it is a
late effect of neurodegeneration, Markesbery et al. [59]
longitudinally followed and autopsied healthy control
participants, those with MCI, and those with late stage AD.
While signiﬁcant increases in both F2-isoprostanes and
F4-neuroprostanes were found in both MCI and AD
compared with healthy controls, the only difference
between MCI and AD was an increase in F4-neuroprostanes
in late AD. The authors concluded that oxidative damage
therefore precedes AD and is not simply a byproduct [59].
A review of both human and animal studies found a
clear relationship between oxidative stress and cognitive
decline in MCI and dementia [60]. Postmortem studies in
humans consistently show increased lipid peroxidation in
the brains of patients with AD in comparison to controls,
while ROS-oxidized proteins are also increased in the
frontal and parietal lobes and in the hippocampus of AD
and MCI patients [58]. Schrag et al. [61] reported in their
metaanalysis a signiﬁcant elevation of plasma and serum
malondialdehyde levels in AD compared with controls.
While only two studies had investigated malondialdehyde
in MCI, both of these also demonstrated a signiﬁcant
increase. Six studies included in the metaanalysis also
found an increase of approximately 60% in DNA/RNA
damage in AD.
This relationship also exists in individuals without clin-
ical neurological conditions. In a review of 19 scientiﬁc
articles including over 3500 participants, Newton and
colleagues [51] described a relationship between oxidative
stress and cognition in individuals without stroke, neuro-
degeneration, MCI, and/or AD. Their ﬁndings demonstrated
a clear relationship between oxidative stress and poorer
cognitive performance, as well as positive correlations
between antioxidant status and cognitive performance. In
particular, lipid peroxidation was most commonly associated
relationships
particularly evident in tasks of frontal-executive function
and attention, but more tentative evidence was also found in
learning and memory tasks as well as measures of global
cognitive function.
Several studies have demonstrated a negative relation-
ship between markers of oxidative stress and performance
of cognitive tasks. In elderly individuals, F2a-isoprostanes
(markers of lipid peroxidation) were signiﬁcantly nega-
tively correlated with overall mini-mental state examination

(MMSE) scores, a measure of global cognitive function
[62]. An association has also been reported between total
antioxidant status (TAS) and scores on the Repeatable
Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
(RBANS) [63]. Furthermore, in a study of global cognitive
function in 1166 individuals, those below the 25th
percentile for selenium (important for antioxidant enzyme
function) and above the 75th percentile for thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances (TBARS; a byproduct of lipid
peroxidation) had an increased risk of poor MMSE scores
after 4 years [64].
In terms of speciﬁc cognitive domains, there is evidence
for a positive association between antioxidant status and
measures of working memory [65,66]. A signiﬁcant nega-
tive correlation was found between total oxidant status and
total scores on the digit span test in day-workers, while in
night-workers
total
(TAC)
signiﬁcantly positively correlated with Wechsler attention
and concentration scales, and the recognition scale of the
Auditory and Verbal Learning Test [67]. However, the
authors also reported a negative association between TAC
and long-term memory, suggesting that the relationship
populations may be rather more complex.
Potential nutraceutical targets for
improving cognition via reducing
While the effects of free radicals are attenuated to some
extent by endogenous antioxidant factors, such as gluta-
thione (GSH), SOD and catalase, these compounds can be
assisted by exogenous compounds primarily derived from
dietary sources [68].
It has been proposed that nutraceutical interventions
with antioxidant properties may have the ability to slow
cognitive decline and reduce the incidence of neurological
disease through reducing oxidative damage [22]. Such
interventions are easily accessible and relatively inexpen-
sive, and may serve to maintain cognitive function through
reducing the risk of increased oxidative stress. Some of the
nutraceuticals that have shown promise in this area are
discussed below.
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10; 2,3 dimethyoxy-5-methyl-6-
decaprenyl benzoquinone), also known as ubiquinone, is
a lipid-soluble quinone compound containing a redox
active quinone ring and hydrophobic tail [22]. CoQ10 is
synthesized endogenously, primarily in the mitochondria
but also in cell membranes and lipoproteins. It is most
densely concentrated in organs that have the highest energy
requirements such as the brain, heart, kidney, and liver
tissue [22].
The primary function of CoQ10 is its role in cellular
energy production. CoQ10 is an integral component of the
electron transport chain for mitochondrial oxidative respira-
tion, which generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CoQ10
accepts electrons from complexes I (NADH-ubiquinone
oxidoreductase) and II (succinate dehydrogenase) and is a
coenzyme for complex III. At the same time, CoQ10
contributes to the transfer of protons (Hþ) from the
mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a
proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
When the protons ﬂow back into the mitochondrial interior,
the energy releases to form ATP (Fig. 6.3).

CoQ10 and oxidative stress
CoQ10 protects cell membranes and low-density lipopro-
teins, mitochondrial lipoprotein, and DNA from oxidative
damage [22,70]. Moreover, CoQ10 is capable of recycling
and regenerating other antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid
and a-tocopherol [71,72].
CoQ10 also reduces the proliferation of ROS by
activating and increasing antiapoptotic processes through
the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins [22].
Sharma’s study has provided evidence for the potential
antiinﬂammatory role of CoQ10 by demonstrating its
ability to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore and to reduce interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a,
and nuclear factor-kB expression, thus achieving anti-
inﬂammatory effects [73]. Gene expression analysis and
cell culture experiments to reduce the activity of inﬂam-
matory markers provide further evidence of CoQ10’s
antiinﬂammatory effects via modiﬁcation of gene expres-
sion [22]. The daily human requirement of CoQ10 is
covered by a mix of endogenous biosynthesis and dietary
intake. A lower dietary intake of CoQ10 or a decrease in
biosynthesis can lead to decreased CoQ10 plasma and
tissue levels. CoQ10 can exist in an oxidized form
(ubiquinone) or reduced form (ubiquinol). Some studies
have shown that the reduced form of CoQ10 (ubiquinol,
QH) is 2e4 times more bioavailable than the conventional
CoQ10 [74].
CoQ10 as a potential treatment for cognitive
Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been
shown to be major contributors to cognitive decline and the
pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases
[75]. It has been proposed that reductions in oxidative
damage improve mitochondrial function and genomic
stability; and thus, reductions in age-related cognitive
dysfunction [76]. For example, Liu et al. found that levels of
lipid peroxidation, a product of mitochondrial respiration,
were signiﬁcantly higher in old rats compared to younger
rats. When old rats were treated with the antioxidant, R-
a-lipoic acid, lipid peroxidation in these rats was comparable
to those seen in young rats. Old rats also had lower levels of
oxidative damage to neural structures, with improved
memory, spatial learning, and hippocampal function [76].
Animal studies have revealed that CoQ10 supplementa-
tion exhibits beneﬁcial antioxidative effects, upregulates

hippocampus and cerebral cortex have been shown to lead to
cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases such
as AD and other dementias [79,80]. Similarly, Beal
demonstrated that CoQ10 prevented the loss of dopamine
and dopaminergic axons in the striatum of 1-year-old mice
[77], and Matthews et al. found that feeding 1-year-old mice
200 mg/kg of CoQ10daily for 1e2 months resulted in
30%e40% increases in mitochondrial concentrations of
CoQ10 in the cerebral cortex [81]. Thus, CoQ10 has been
suggested to be used as a therapeutic treatment for MCI or
even dementia.
In a study on aged transgenic mice overexpressing
presenilin as the model of AD, CoQ10 treatment partially
reduced amyloid-beta overproduction, as well as intra-
cellular amyloid-beta cortical deposits [82]. Additionally,
the treatment reduced oxidative stress, with showing a
decreased malondialdehyde level and upregulated the
activity of SOD [82]. In TG19959 transgenic mice models
of AD, CoQ10 treatment resulted in reduced protein
carbonyl level, a marker of oxidative stress and decreased
amyloid-beta 42 levels in brain. Furthermore, CoQ10-
treated mice showed improved cognitive performance as
measured by the Morris water maze task [83]. These
encouraging observations in animal studies have prompted

beneﬁts of CoQ10 in human clinical populations.
Pycnogenol (PYC) is a patented extract from the bark of the
French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster) that grows along
the coastal southwest of France. The extract consists of a
speciﬁc blend of phenolic compounds, including monomers
(catechin, epicatechin, and taxifolin), condensed ﬂavonoids
(procyanidins), and phenolic acids (cinnamic acids and
other glycosides) [84]. Its use as a nutritional supplement
spans a broad range of conditions including dry skin,
Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), severe
inﬂammation,

dysfunction.

available in most countries as an over-the-counter product
in doses of 20e100 mg.
Although PYC has a long historical use, it has only
relatively recently been researched scientiﬁcally. While
PYC is thought to have a number of bioactivities, including
free radical scavenging, protecting DNA from damage,
metal chelating, and modulating enzyme activity, it is most
recognized for having a pronounced antioxidant capacity.
In addition, it protects other endogenous antioxidants such
as vitamins C and E, thereby further increasing antioxidant
activity [85]. Through these mechanisms it acts as a

There is increasing evidence for the antioxidative actions of
PYC, from both preclinical and clinical studies. In vitro
experiments on cultured neuroblastoma cells demonstrated
that pretreatment with PYC signiﬁcantly reduced cytotox-
icity, protein damage, lipid peroxidation, and cell death
following oxidative stress toxicity induced by acrolein [86].
In an animal model of dementia, rats were pretreated with
either PYC, vitamin E, or a sham before receiving intra-
cerebroventricular streptozotocin to induce toxicity [87].
Those treated with PYC and vitamin E showed reduced
cognitive deﬁcits and oxidative damage in the cerebral
cortex and hippocampus following insult, compared with
sham-treated animals.
Several human trials have also demonstrated the anti-
oxidant actions of PYC. Cigarette smokers generally have
higher levels of oxidative stress than nonsmokers; however
50 mg/day PYC was shown to reduce plasma levels of ROS
as well as increasing antioxidant potential (assessed using
the biological antioxidant potential test) in a group of 78
smokers [88]. A small sample of healthy adults supple-
mented with 150 mg/day PYC for 6 weeks showed a
signiﬁcant increase in plasma oxygen radical absorbance
capacity (ORAC), a marker of antioxidant activity [89]. In a
randomized controlled trial (RCT), 61 children diagnosed
with ADHD received either 1 mg/kg body weight or
placebo daily for 1 month. PYC was shown to reduce
oxidative damage to DNA in comparison to placebo [90].
Preclinical ﬁndings have demonstrated protective effects of
PYC on cognitive function. Ishrat and colleagues [87]
reported that rats who received 10 mg/kg PYC via intra-
peritoneal injection daily for 3 weeks showed reduced
deﬁcits in performance on the passive avoidance and
Morris water maze tasks following streptozotocin infusion.
In a murine model of accelerated aging, senescence-
accelerated mice were fed orally with PYC at doses of 5
or 10 mg/kg twice daily for 2 months [91]. Mice receiving
PYC had signiﬁcantly enhanced memory retention in both
active and passive avoidance tests, suggesting that PYC
ameliorate
functions associated with aging.
Results from clinical trials conducted to date show
promise for the use of PYC as a cognitive enhancer. In
young healthy university students, daily supplementation
with 100 mg PYC for 8 weeks in conjunction with a
standardized health plan resulted in improvements in
sustained attention, memory, and executive functioning.
The students in the PYC intervention group also performed
better on their actual exams than their control group
counterparts, as well as showed improvements in mood
[92]. Using a slightly higher dose of 150 mg/day and an
intervention duration of 12 weeks, Belcaro et al. [93] also
investigated the effects of PYC in combination with a
healthy lifestyle plan in young professionals who had
elevated oxidative stress at baseline. PYC was associated
with signiﬁcant improvements in mood and memory, as
well as a 30.4% reduction in plasma free radicals. No
signiﬁcant changes were observed in the control group.
Beneﬁcial effects of PYC on cognitive function have
also been reported in older individuals. In an early RCT,
60e85
consumed 150 mg PYC, or placebo, daily for 3 months
[50]. Participants completed a cognitive battery at 1-, 2-,
and 3-months of taking the study treatment, comprising
tasks measuring attention, processing speed, working
memory,
reasoning,
secondary
memory,
skilled
coordination. Bioassays were also conducted, including
analysis of plasma F2-isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative
stress, at baseline and 3 months. The researchers found an

F2-isoprostane concentrations. No improvements were
observed in concentration or psychomotor abilities. This
supports the notion that PYC is an antioxidant capable
of ending in-progress oxidative reactions, as well as
improving the mental functions most affected by normal
aging.

both objective and subjective measures of cognitive
function, as well as assessments of daily tasks. Oxidative
stress was also reduced by more than 28% from the initial
baseline measurement. These improvements were not
found in the nontreated control group.
To evaluate the effects of PYC supplementation on
cognition in individuals with MCI, Hosoi and colleagues
[95] randomized 87 participants who scored to receive
either 150 mg/day PYC with standard management, or
standard management only, for 2 months. At baseline,
participants scored between 18 and 23 on the MMSE, a
score that indicates MCI. After 8 weeks of the intervention,
the median increase in MMSE score in the PYC-treated
group was 18%, compared with a 2.48% increase in the
standard management only group. This increase in score in
the PYC group was statistically signiﬁcant, and the average
posttreatment score improved to 25.64, above the threshold
for MCI.

Findings from preclinical and clinical trials suggest that
PYC demonstrates good tolerability with few side effects
[84], and based on the available data it has been classiﬁed
by an independent panel of toxicology experts as generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) [96]. In a 12-month study in
which healthy 55e70 year-olds consumed 100 mg/day
PYC, no adverse events were reported [94].
According to Simpson et al. [97] data from 91 human
clinical trials of PYC involving over 6000 participants indi-
cate that the frequency of adverse events (AEs) is 2.4%; in
comparison, the global AErate inhealthy participantsis0.1%.
AEs reported in these trials were not related to the duration or
dose of PYC supplementation. The most commonly reported
AE was gastrointestinal discomfort, while dizziness, head-
ache, and nausea had also been reported, indicating that any
AEs associated with PYC use are unlikely to be severe.
Although there are no known contraindications for
PYC, it is not recommended for use in children under 6
years of age or during the ﬁrst 3 months of pregnancy.
Vitamins E and C
Vitamins, in particular, vitamin E and vitamin C, have many
biological effects including antioxidant activity. E vitamins
are fat-soluble compounds including tocopherols and toco-
trienols, of which a-tocopherol is the biologically active
form [98]. Vitamin E protects neuronal cells from free
radical damage [99] and also lowers brain lipid peroxidation
[100]. Vitamin C (L-ascorbate), on the other hand, is water-
soluble and while produced endogenously by many organ-
isms, this does not include humans. Vitamin C works in the
body as both an antioxidant as well as a pro-oxidant [101],
and acts as a cofactor in the synthesis of catecholamines and
the modulation of neurotransmitters [102].
Like many vitamins, vitamins C and E work well in
combination. Vitamin C has been shown to recycle
oxidized vitamin E, suggesting that vitamin E may be more
effective when taken in combination with vitamin C [101].
This suggestion has largely been supported by epide-
miological studies that have shown that long-term vitamin
C and E users have better cognitive performance than those
that have never used supplements [103]. Similarly, data
from the Cache County Study found that the use of vitamin
C and E in combination was associated with a reduction in
AD prevalence and incidence [104].
The relationship between antioxidant vitamins and cogni-
tion has been studied in many large-scale epidemiological
studies, and has produced mixed results.
Previous studies have reported signiﬁcant differences in
antioxidant vitamin levels in the blood of dementia
sufferers compared to normal controls. Speciﬁcally, Foy
et al. [105] found that blood levels of vitamins A, C, and E
were signiﬁcantly lower in patients with AD or vascular
dementia when compared to controls. Similarly, in a study
of more than 4000 elderly participants, Perkins et al. [106]
reported an association between impaired memory and
decreased levels of vitamin E. Vitamins A and C were not
associated with impaired memory.
Furthermore, in healthy elderly participants, better
cognitive performance has been associated with higher
levels of plasma vitamin C [107], serum vitamin E, and
dietary vitamin E [108]. A small study conducted by Sales
et al. [109] found that patients with obstructive sleep
apnoea had lower vitamins E levels and performed worse
on cognitive tasks compared to control participants.
Additionally, the study reported an association between
vitamin E levels and performance on the backwards digit
span task [109]. Perrig et al. [110] also found associations
between antioxidant vitamins and cognitive performance in
a sample of healthy older individuals. Speciﬁcally they
identiﬁed a signiﬁcant association between plasma vitamin
C and beta-carotene levels and memory performance.
Moreover,
metaanalysis
studies
investigations of oxidative stress in AD and MCI, 20
studies collectively found a signiﬁcant reduction in vitamin
E of around 20% in AD compared with controls [61].
Antioxidant vitamin intake has been studied in relation
to cognitive performance. One study observed a relation-
ship between cognitive performance and past dietary intake
of vitamins A and E, where past intake was recorded 6
years before current cognitive testing [107]. Similarly,
results from the Rotterdam study, reported by Engelhart
et al. [111], found that individuals that had a high dietary
intake of vitamins C and E at baseline, had a lower risk of
developing dementia over the 6-year follow-up period.
Polidori et al. [62] found that individuals with a high fruit
and vegetable intake had signiﬁcantly higher cognitive scores,
higher levels of carotenoids and a- and g-tocopherols,
and lower F2 isoprostanes. Furthermore, they reported that
cognitive scores were positively associated with vitamin E
lycopene,
negatively
correlated
F2
isoprostanes and protein carbonyls [62]. These results are in
contrast to the ﬁndings from the HonolulueAsia Aging
study, a large longitudinal study of Japanese-American men
that did not ﬁnd any associations between dietary intake of
antioxidant vitamins C and E and risk of developing
dementia [112]. In contrast, long-term users of antioxidant
supplements demonstrated beneﬁts of combined vitamin C
and E supplements in this cohort. In particular, the long-
term use of vitamins C and E was associated with a
reduced risk of vascular dementia and better cognitive
performance. The risk of AD was not inﬂuenced by
supplementation [65].

Studies investigating the protective effect of supple-
mentation with antioxidant vitamins on cognitive decline
and lowering the risk of developing AD and other forms of
dementia have yielded inconsistent ﬁndings. For instance,
data from the Nurses’ Health Study found long-term
vitamin C and E supplement users have better cognitive
performance than those that have never used supplements
[103]. Similarly, the use of a combination of vitamin C and
E was associated with a reduction in AD prevalence and
incidence in the Cache County Study [104]. While data
from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging did not
observe a reduced risk of incident dementia or AD, they did
ﬁnd that the risk of experiencing signiﬁcant cognitive
decline was reduced for users of vitamin C and E and/or
multivitamins over the 5-year follow-up [113]. In contrast
to these ﬁndings, Fillenbaum et al. [114] did not ﬁnd
that the use of vitamins C and/or E reduced the risk of
developing dementia. Similar results were reported by
Luchsinger et al. [115], who found that supplemental or
dietary intake of carotenes, vitamins C or E did not reduce
the risk of developing AD over the 4-year study follow-up
period.
Extending on the ﬁndings from the epidemiological
research, a number of RCTs have investigated the effects
performance, with mixed results.
In a large trial of patients with moderate AD, Sano et al.
[116] found that supplementing with vitamin E for 2 years
slowed the progression of AD when compared to placebo.
This is in contract to the ﬁndings of another large RCT that
found that 3 years of vitamin E supplementation had no
effect on the rate of progression from MCI to AD [117].
RCTs in healthy individuals have also produced mixed
results. For instance, Kang et al. [118] found no effect of
vitamin E supplementation on cognitive performance in
healthy female participants. Furthermore, supplementing
for 5 years with vitamin E, vitamin C, or beta-carotene did
function;
small
posttreatment association between vitamin C and cognitive
performance was observed at the last follow-up session
[119]. Conversely, a 4-year study of an antioxidant
combination (vitamins C, E, beta-carotene, zinc, and
selenium) found that episodic memory was improved in the
supplement group compared to placebo. It was also
reported that nonsmokers with low vitamin C levels at
baseline had improved verbal memory scores in the
supplement group [120].
The results described above do not allow for a clear
conclusion regarding the effects of antioxidant vitamins in
terms of their cognitive beneﬁts. Schrag [61] suggests that the
discrepancies between the data for vitamin E investigations
could be that while oral vitamin E supplements increase serum
concentrations,theseincreaseshavenodirectimpactonserum
antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, supplemental forms of
vitamin E often contain high levels of a-tocopherol, which
results in a reduction of other forms of vitamin E within the
blood. Others have suggested that supplements may only
beneﬁt those with a low dietary intake. This hypothesis is
supported by data from the Chicago Health and Aging project,
which reported that supplementing with vitamin E only
protected from cognitive decline in individuals with low
vitamin E intake [66].
Carotenoids are large lipophilic molecules found in plants
that produce yellow, orange, and red colors, and are
involved in photosynthesis. They cannot be synthesized
endogenously by animals and must be obtained through
diet, although animals can perform some metabolic trans-
formations of ingested carotenoids [121]. Around 700
carotenoids are found in living organisms, although only a
small subset is found in signiﬁcant amounts [121].
Approximately 50 carotenoids are present in the typical
human diet, with 20 being found in human tissue and blood
[122]. Depending on dietary habits, blood levels range from
0.01 to 1 mol/L amounts that can be substantially increased
with supplementation [123]. Due to their fat solubility, the
plasma half-life of carotenoids is fairly long compared with
other plant compounds (days to weeks as opposed to hours)
[124].
Carotenoids can be divided into two major groups:
carotenes (e.g., a-carotene, b-carotene, lycopene), which
contain only carbon and hydrogen; and xanthophylls
(e.g., lutein, astaxanthin), which contain at least one oxygen
atom. Xanthophylls are further subdivided according to
whether the oxygen-containing substituent is a hydroxyl
(hydroxycarotenoids) or a ketone (ketocarotenoids).

primarily in orange and yellow vegetables and fruits, which

yellow vegetables and fruits, while lycopene (LYC) is
found in tomatoes and tomato products, and dark green
vegetables are rich in lutein [122]. Lutein, zeaxanthin and

suggests these carotenoids are crucial for optimizing vision

Dietary intake of fat during the same meal as carotenoid
consumption may effectively increase the absorption of
some carotenoids [126], while consumption of multiple
carotenoids during the same meal may lead to reduced
bioavailability due to competition during absorption [127].

The structure of carotenoids allows them to scavenge free
radicals by trapping peroxyl radicals and quenching the
singlet oxygen. This is due to the presence of an electron-
rich conjugated chain system and polyisoprenoid structure
[122]. These properties render all carotenoids potent anti-
oxidants; however, lycopene (LYC) appears to have
received the most attention in this area, perhaps due to the
abundance of tomatoes in the Mediterranean diet, which is
known to have many beneﬁcial effects on health.
LYC is a highly efﬁcient antioxidant and free radical
scavenger, and inhibits lipid peroxidation, ROS, and
oxidative DNA damage [128e130]. LYC also has effects
on the PI3K/AKT pathway, NF-kB transcription factors,
and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor g (PPARg)
pathway, all of which are involved in regulating oxidative
processes [131]. In preclinical studies, LYC has been
shown to reduce lipid and protein oxidation measured using
serum TBARS and thiols [132], ameliorate oxidative stress
neuroinﬂammation
fructose-drinking
insulin-
resistant rats [133], and reduce mitochondrial dysfunction
[129]. These ﬁndings were accompanied by cognitive
improvements [129,133]. In mice with D-galactose-induced
cognitive impairment, LYC supplementation also signiﬁ-
cantly increased antioxidant enzyme activity and activated
the mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzymes, as well as
attenuated neuronal oxidative damage via the Nrf2/NF-kB
transcriptional pathway [134]. Oxidative stress was also
reduced in mice with age-induced cognitive impairment,
apparently through suppression of MDA levels, which led to
increases in activity of the endogenous antioxidants gluta-
thione, catalase, and SOD [135]. Levels of antioxidant
enzyme mRNAs were also increased including those of heme
oxygenase 1 and NAD-(P)-H-quinone oxidoreductase-1.
Accompanying these ﬁndings were reductions in neuronal
damage
inﬂammation, lowered accumulation of b-amyloid in the
brain, and improvements in learning and memory.
Human trials are limited and ﬁndings are mixed. In a
small trial of only ﬁve participants, a single daily serving of
tomatoes reduced oxidative DNA damage in white blood
cells within 24 h [136]. Moreover, 21 days’ intake of
tomato products reduced urinary 8-iso PGF2a, a marker of
lipid oxidation, by 50% [137]. In another small trial, 19
participants received LYC in the form of tomato juice,
spaghetti sauce, and tomato oleoresin for a period of
1 week each, with blood samples collected at the end of
each intervention period. The authors reported signiﬁcant
decreases in serum lipid peroxidation and LDL oxidation
[138]. However, in a trial where different doses of LYC
were administered for 8 weeks, no differences were
observed in urinary F2-isoprostanes, MDA, or LDL
oxidation rate. The highest dose of 30 mg/d was, however,
associated with reduced lymphocyte DNA damage and
urinary 8-OHdG [139]. Similarly, in diabetic patients
receiving 10 mg/d LYC the supplement did not alter TAC
or oxidized LDL, but did reduce serum MDA [140].
The antioxidant effects of other carotenoids have been
studied less extensively. An in vitro study of lutein demon-
strated its ability to suppress ROS and promote antioxidant
protein expression including heme oxygenase 1 and NAD-
(P)-H-quinone oxidoreductase-1 [141]. In an intervention
trial of carotenoid-rich foods, 23 healthy male participants
received 330 mL tomato juice containing 40 mg LYC daily
for 2 weeks, followed by 330 mL carrot juice containing
22.3 mg b-carotene and 15.7 mg a-carotene daily for
2 weeks, and ﬁnally 10 g dried spinach powder containing
11.3 mg lutein daily for 2 weeks [142]. Only the carrot juice
intervention resulted in reduced oxidative DNA damage,
although all interventions were associated with decreased
levels of strand breaks in lymphocyte DNA. Carrot juice
supplementation was also associated with reduced 8-iso
PGF2a in breast cancer survivors [143].
While the above ﬁndings appear to demonstrate the
antioxidant capacity of carotenoids, Perez-Rodriguez [121]
wonders if this is a valid assumption. He suggests that
while the “antioxidant role” hypothesis of carotenoids
cannot be rejected, there is not enough evidence to support
it either. For example, although there appears to be a
relationship between carotenoid pigmentation and oxidative
stress this could be explained in terms of carotenoids being
particularly sensitive to being altered by ROS rather than
being due to a strong antioxidant capacity. Further research
is warranted to address whether this is in fact the case.
Lycopene is again the carotenoid that features most
prominently in preclinical research in this area. Several
studies have reported beneﬁcial effects on cognition using
classic paradigms such as the Morris water maze and
Y-maze tests [133e135,144,145]. These ﬁndings were
often accompanied by reductions in oxidative stress, but
other physiological effects were also reported. For example,
LYC

[135,145] and reduced levels of amyloid precursor protein
(APP) [145]. MDA levels were also suppressed by LYC
[135,144], while GSH [115,124], SOD [115,124], catalase
[115], and ubiquinone [124] were all increased. Zhao et al.
[134] discovered an increase in BDNF levels in the
hippocampus with LYC, an amelioration of histopatho-
logical damage, elevated antioxidant enzyme activity, and a
reduction in levels of inﬂammatory cytokines. Reversal of
neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction have also been
reported [135].
Numerous correlational studies have examined the
relationships between direct (e.g., plasma levels) and

indirect (e.g., food diary) measures of carotenoids and

performance, particularly on the digit symbol substitution
test [146]. Although the use of this methodology to
estimate carotenoid levels has limitations, interesting
ﬁndings such as differences by race/ethnicity [146] warrant
further investigation.
Low plasma carotenoid levels have been associated
with poorer performance of tests of attention, psychomotor
speed, and logical reasoning [147], while several cognitive
domains

[110]. Of particular importance, b-carotene signiﬁcantly

stress and AD revealed that while b-carotene was only

controls,
a-carotene is severely diminished by approximately 46% in
AD and by around 52% in MCI [61]. On the other hand,
Wang et al. [148] described a relationship between mod-
erate to severe AD and lower plasma levels of b-carotene
and lutein, in comparison to mild AD or control patients. In
the same study, lower b-carotene and lutein were also
associated with a lower score on the MMSE.
LYC was also shown to correlate with scores on the
MMSE, the clock drawing test, and the DemTect (a
screening test for dementia comprising ﬁve subscales) in a
study where participants reporting high intake of fruit and
vegetables also had lower F2-isoprostanes and superior
overall
those
reporting low intake [62]. In a study of octogenarians,
centenarians, and centenarian decedents, serum levels of
lutein, zeaxanthin, and b-carotene were most consistently
related to cognitive performance, although only lutein was
octogenarians.
Lutein
b-carotene in brain tissue were also associated with
cognitive performance, with lutein correlating with a range
of measures. Given that the authors found no association
between a-tocopherol and cognitive measures, they postu-
late that the associations with carotenoids may be due to
factors other than their antioxidant activities, a concept that
merits further investigation [149].
On the other hand, b-carotene was not found to corre-
late with poor memory performance in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
conducted on almost 5000 multiethnic participants in the
United States [106]. In that study only a delayed recall task
was used, which may explain the discrepant ﬁndings. Data
from the same survey indicated that high serum levels of
LYC, lutein, and zeaxanthin at baseline were associated
with a lower risk of AD mortality after controlling for
several covariates [150].
Lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin accumulate in
the macula and form MP. MP levels correlate with brain
levels of these carotenoids, and therefore MP has been used
as a proxy for brain levels in numerous studies. In one such
study, in healthy participants only visual-spatial and
constructional abilities were related to retinal lutein and
zeaxanthin, while in participants with MCI these relation-
ships extended to broad cognition including composite
score on the MMSE, visual-spatial and constructional
abilities, language ability, attention, and the total scale on
the RBANS [151]. These ﬁndings suggest that carotenoid
status may be more strongly related to cognitive function in
individuals who are not cognitively healthy. Feeney et al.
[152] also found an association between lower levels of MP
and poorer performance on the MMSE, MoCA, prospective
memory, trail making task, and choice reaction time task in
a sample of over 4453 older adults living in Ireland.
Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the cognitive
effects of carotenoids are somewhat lacking, but the limited
ﬁndings are promising. In male physicians aged over 65
years receiving b-carotene or placebo, participants who
received short-term b-carotene (mean duration 1 year)
showed no difference in cognition compared to the placebo
group. However, those who had been taking b-carotene
long-term (mean duration 18 years) demonstrated signiﬁ-
cantly better performance compared with those receiving
placebo, both in terms of a global cognitive function score
and a verbal memory composite score. These effects were
comparable to delaying cognitive aging by 1 to 1.5 years
[153]. A limitation of the study was that cognitive function
assessed
baseline;
therefore,
preexisting
differences between the groups cannot be ruled out.
The effects of 12 months’ supplementation with a daily
formulation of 10 mg lutein, 10 mg meso-zeaxanthin, and
2 mg zeaxanthin or placebo on various cognitive domains
were assessed in an RCT of 91 participants with low MP
[154]. MP and serum levels of these carotenoids were
measured at baseline and after 12 months’ supplementation.
Signiﬁcant improvements in memory were observed in the
intervention group, particularly on the paired associates
learning (PAL) test. The PAL test has been shown to be an
effective test of hippocampal connectivity and is sensitive
to both clinical and nonclinical cognitive impairment [155].
The reduction in errors on the PAL test also correlated with
increases in MP volume and increased serum levels of
lutein. There were no differences between groups in
immediate memory, but those receiving the supplement
made fewer errors on the verbal recall memory delayed
task. The authors highlight that baseline error rates were
low in both groups and therefore the difference in errors
may not be meaningful [154].

On the other hand, in a large study of 2166 elderly
participants with an average of 6.9 years’ treatment, no
differences in cognitive function or risk of cognitive decline
were found between groups receiving antioxidants (vitamin
C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, and b-carotene 15 mg); zinc
and copper; antioxidants plus zinc and copper; or placebo
[156]. The authors highlight that a limitation of the study
was its cross-sectional design, meaning that cognitive
changes over time were not assessed. The doses of antiox-
idants used in this study may also have been insufﬁcient to
produce effects on cognitive outcomes. In a systematic
review of the evidence, Butler et al. [157] concluded that
there is insufﬁcient evidence to support the use of b-carotene
for cognitive decline, but noted that many studies had a short
follow-up period and used a variable set of cognitive
outcome measures, making conclusions difﬁcult to draw.
Other studies do suggest that combined treatment with
carotenoids and other nutraceuticals may lead to synergistic
effects. A dietary supplement containing a combination
formula of astaxanthin, Bacopa monnieri, phosphati-
dylserine, and vitamin E improved memory skills after
60 days of treatment in a multicenter trial of older adults
with MCI [158]. Signiﬁcant improvements were observed
on the clock drawing test and the AD assessment scaled
cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) with the memory compo-
nents showing the largest improvements. Better baseline
MMSE scores were associated with larger improvements in
total ADAS-cog scores, suggesting that the beneﬁts of this
formula may be most pronounced in less cognitively
compromised individuals. Johnson et al. [159] randomized
women aged 60e80 years to receive DHA alone, lutein
alone, a combination of DHA and lutein, or placebo daily
for 4 months. Verbal ﬂuency improved in all groups except
placebo, while in the combination treatment group memory
scores and rate of learning also signiﬁcantly improved.
These ﬁndings may be explained by evidence suggesting
that dietary fat intake improves bioavailability of caroten-
oids [126]. In fact, Johnson et al. [159] did report that DHA
enhanced lutein transport across the blood-brain barrier in
their participants.
Carotenoids appear to be safe and well tolerated in the doses
studied. Zanotta et al. [158] reported only one nonserious
adverse event in their 60-day trial of a combination formula
containing astaxanthin, B. monnieri, phosphatidylserine,
and vitamin E. Furthermore, 99% of the participants rated
tolerability to be excellent or good. In the Physicians Health
Study b-carotene had no impact on cardiovascular disease,
cancer, or overall mortality after 12 years of follow-up [153].
Conversely, in their review of the literature Kaulmann and
Bohn [124] concluded that administration of isolated
carotenoids to nonhealthy individuals may bear several
risks, as some trials reported increased risk of cardiovascular
disease, lung cancer, and stroke. This may be due to the pro-
oxidant properties of carotenoids that may be present under
certain circumstances.
Findings from animal studies suggest that lutein is safe,
with no teratogenic or mutagenic outcomes [160,161].
Although an Institute of Medicine report concluded that no
toxic effect of lutein was observed in intervention or
epidemiological studies [162], an upper safety limit of
2 mg/kg daily was set by the Joint Expert Committee on
Food Additives [163], while the European Food Safety
Authority advise an upper limit of 1 mg/kg daily [164]. One
study reported an increased risk of skin yellowing with
lutein supplementation at a dose of 15 mg/day [165];
however, it has been suggested that lutein at a dose of
10 mg/day is safe and nontoxic [122].
Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants, involved
in several essential physiological processes including
reproduction, pigmentation, and the adaption to and
stressors.
abundant
micronutrients in the human diet, and are present in the
majority of fruits and vegetables. Over 10,000 polyphenol
compounds have been identiﬁed in plants, and are classiﬁed
based on their number of phenol rings and the structural
elements that bind them. These are: ﬂavonoids, phenolic
acids, lignans, and stilbenes; or more commonly grouped
into ﬂavonoids and nonﬂavonoid compounds.
Flavonols, primarily found in grapes, cocoa and chocolate,
and tea, include catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and are one of the main
ﬂavonoid groups. Flavanols have been identiﬁed as having
a range of beneﬁcial physiologic and antioxidant effects,
particularly in terms of vascular function [166].
Flavonols comprise quercetin, found in capers, apples,
onions, and green tea, and kaempferol, found in fruits, tea,
and vegetables. Flavonols are also a component of G.
biloba, a plant whose extracts are often used for cognitive
enhancement
[167].
Isoﬂavones
genistein,
daidzein, and glycitein are phytoestrogens found in abun-
dance in soybeans, and are agonists of estrogen receptors.
For this reason they have gained attention as potential
therapeutic agents in menopausal and postmenopausal
women. Berries such as blueberries, cranberries, raspberry
seeds, and strawberries are good sources of anthocyanidins.
Anthocyanidins have antiinﬂammatory, antinociceptive,
vasodilative, and antioxidant effects, as well as potential
antidepressant properties [168].

Within the nonﬂavonoid compounds, curcumin (1,7-bis(4-
hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) also
called diferuloylmethane and resveratrol (3,5,40-trihydroxy-
trans-stilbene) are the most renowned for their antioxidant
properties. These compounds have the ability to cross the
blood-brain barrier and therefore have the potential to affect
the brain.
Curcumin, a bright yellow polyphenol found in the
rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric), has a long history of
use as a herbal medicine in Asia for conditions ranging
from pain associated with inﬂammatory conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis to psoriasis. More recently, the use
of curcumin and its bioactive constituents as potential
cognitive enhancers have begun to be explored.
Resveratrol is found in numerous edible fruits such as
blueberries, strawberries, and grape skin as well as in
peanuts [169]. Red wine contains high concentrations of
resveratrol, with some wines containing up to 57 mM
depending on the type and geographical region of origin. In
addition
both
resveratrol are known to have neuroprotective and anti-
inﬂammatory
[98,170],
contribute to cognitive-enhancing effects.
Of the ﬂavonoids, ﬂavanols appear to have the largest
evidence base for effects on oxidative stress. Clinical trials
involving short- and moderate-term supplementation with
grape juice, high in catechin and epicatechin, demonstrated
an increase in serum antioxidant capacity and reduced LDL
oxidation in individuals with cerebrovascular diseases
[171]. In rats, daily treatment with EGCG resulted in
reduced oxidative
stress compared with controls, as
measured using lipid peroxide production levels and
plasma antioxidant power. EGCG also reduced ROS
concentration in the hippocampus and reduced blood
pressure compared to controls, as well as improved learning
and memory [172].
Flavonols have also received some attention for their
antioxidant properties. Quercetin is a highly potent anti-
oxidant and prevents endothelial apoptosis caused by
oxidants [167]. In a clinical study, young male runners
received either 1000 mg/day quercetin or placebo for
6 weeks while maintaining their usual training schedules. A
association
found
supplementation and reduced malondialdehyde levels,
suggesting that quercetin reduces oxidative stress [173].
In vitro evidence suggests that kaempferol protects against
H2O2-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells [174]. Further
preclinical and clinical trials are needed to address whether
these effects are present in vivo. Free-radical scavenging
properties of G. biloba have also been demonstrated [167]
although
unclear
whether
ﬂavonols
components are responsible for these properties.
Blueberry extract, rich in anthocyanidins and also
containing other phenolics, has been shown to inhibit ROS
as well as increasing glutathione [175]. This ﬁnding was
accompanied by reversal of cognitive impairment, and
while the antioxidant properties of blueberries may underlie
this improvement, modulation of inﬂammation pathways
may also be involved.
There is increasing evidence for the antioxidative actions of
both resveratrol and curcumin from preclinical and clinical
studies. Curcumin is well known for its antioxidant effects
and is a scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
[176], and is able to enhance cell viability through reducing
ROS in mouse models of encephalitis [177]. As curcumin
is a lipophilic compound, it is also an efﬁcient collector of
peroxyl radicals, as well as being able to modulate the
activity of GSH, catalase, and SOD [98]. Curcumin can
also inhibit ROS-generating enzymes such as lipoxygenase/
cyclooxygenase [178].
Rats treated with curcumin had lower lactate and muscle
MDA levels compared with controls, as well as increased
antioxidant enzyme activity levels following a 6-week
exercise program [179]. In humans, supplementation with
dietary curcumin at a dose of 1 g/day for 8 weeks was found
to improve antioxidant capacity, reduce lipid peroxidation,
and reduce C-reactive protein in participants with metabolic
syndrome [180]. In healthy middle-aged men and women,
12 weeks’ supplementation with 2000 mg/day Longvida
curcumin was associated with a decrease in vascular
oxidative stress [181]. However, systemic oxidative stress
was not changed following curcumin supplementation as
measured through circulating glutathione peroxidase, TAS,
and oxidized low-density lipoprotein.
Resveratrol is a potent free radical and metal scavenger,
and has the ability to upregulate endogenous antioxidant
enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase [182,183]. In
addition, resveratrol was found to promote heme oxygenase
1 (HO1), an enzyme that protects neurons from oxidative
stresserelated damage [184]. In vitro evidence demon-
strates the potential for resveratrol to prevent oxidative
DNA damage through scavenging of hydroxyl radicals
[185], and to protect neurons from death via antioxidant
activity [177], as well as activating AMPK in neuronal cell
lines [186].
Preclinical ﬁndings demonstrate that supplementation
with resveratrol for several days reduces oxidative stress in
mice both at baseline [187] and following exercise [188].
Clinical data are also promising. In a study of patients

affected by type II diabetes, 8 weeks’ supplementation with
800 mg/day resveratrol was found to increase plasma TAC
and total thiol content. The expression of Nrf2 and SOD
were also signiﬁcantly increased [189]. In a small trial of 14
athletes, participants were randomized to receive resvera-
trol in combination with quercetin, or placebo, for 7 days in
a cross-over design with a 1-week washout period. The
increase in F2-isoprostanes following exercise was reduced
with the combination treatment compared with placebo,
suggesting that these polyphenols taken together may
peroxidation
exercise.
However, no other measures including antioxidant capacity
and inﬂammation revealed treatment effects; therefore, the
authors
concluded
associated with any change in inﬂammation or plasma
antioxidant status [190].
Both curcumin and resveratrol, along with other
polyphenols, have also been shown to activate sirtuin 1
(SIRT1), an enzyme that has been demonstrated to inhibit
oxidative stress and inﬂammation [191].
Evidence for cognitive-enhancing effects of ﬂavanols is
limited; however, one preclinical study reported that rats
treated daily with EGCG demonstrated enhanced learning
and memory assessed using the Morris water maze test
[172]. As these ﬁndings were accompanied by reductions in
markers of oxidative stress, the authors concluded that
these actions were likely due to the antioxidant properties
of EGCG. While clinical trials of the effects of EGCG on
brain and cognitive function are lacking, epidemiological
data suggest tea drinking may be protective against
neurological diseases. In US and Finnish populations high
consumers of tea have a reduced risk of PD [192,193], and
drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of
cognitive impairment in Japanese population [194]. Taken
together, these ﬁndings suggest a potentially beneﬁcial ef-
fect of catechins on brain health, although further research
in the form of clinical trials is needed.
It has been suggested that quercetin may decrease the
size of ischemic lesions in vascular dementia [177,195], as
well as improve memory and synaptic plasticity in the
hippocampus as demonstrated in models of impairment
induced by chronic lead exposure [196]. Preclinical studies
have also shown effects of kaempferol on learning and
memory [197]. Several human studies have demonstrated
beneﬁcial effects of G. biloba on cognition including
memory and attention [198e200]; however others have
shown no beneﬁts over placebo in older adults with normal
cognition or MCI [201e203]. These disparate ﬁndings may
be due to differences in the populations studied or the
particular extracts and doses used; however due to the
variety of different compounds present in G. biloba any
positive effects on cognition cannot be attributed solely to
ﬂavonols.
Findings regarding the cognitive effects of isoﬂavones
are mixed. Visual-spatial memory, learning ability, and
memory have been reported to improve with isoﬂavones
supplementation in both preclinical [204,205] and clinical
studies [206,207], while other clinical trials have reported
no difference between isoﬂavones and placebo [208,209] or
improvements only in spatial working memory in men
[210]. In mice, chronic supplementation with soybeans
improved cognitive performance as well as increased
plasma glutathione peroxidase and reduced thiobarbituric
acid reactive substances (TBARS), suggesting isoﬂavones
have antioxidant properties [211]. On the other hand,
isoﬂavones are also known to act directly on estrogen
receptor b in the brain [205] and improve cholinergic
function [211]. Therefore these other mechanisms may
underlie effects on cognition rather than or in addition to
antioxidant activities.
Of the sources of anthocyanins, blueberries appear to
have the most evidence for cognitive effects. In rats,
anthocyanidins were present in speciﬁc cerebral sites
neocortex
blueberry feeding, indicating that they are able to cross the
blood-brain barrier [212]. Several other preclinical studies
have shown a beneﬁcial effect of blueberry consumption
on short-term memory as evidenced by performance of
memory maze tasks [213e215]. Human studies are
limited, in particular clinical trials. In a small study of nine
older adults, 12 weeks’ daily consumption of blueberry
juice was associated with improved PAL and word list
recall [216]. Similar results were obtained in a small study
of grape juice conducted by the same group [171]. In that
study, 12 participants with memory decline received grape
juice or placebo for 12 weeks, after which signiﬁcant im-
provements were observed in a verbal learning task in the
grape juice group. Nonsigniﬁcant improvements were also
found in verbal and spatial recall tasks. Given the very
small sample sizes of these studies, the ﬁndings should be
interpreted with caution and larger trials are necessary to
conﬁrm the results. A prospective study using a food
frequency questionnaire also found that participants aged
over 70 years with a greater intake of blueberries and
strawberries had a slower rate of cognitive decline,
suggesting a protective effect of berry consumption [217].
It is important to note that blueberries contain other
phenolic compounds such as ﬂavonols and ﬂavanols,
which may contribute to their beneﬁcial effects through
synergistic mechanisms.

Due to the lower rate of AD in India compared with
Western countries, it has been suggested that a diet rich in
curcumin may protect against cognitive decline [218].
Indeed, preclinical studies have revealed beneﬁts of
curcumin in several cognitive domains such as nonspatial
memory and memory acquisition ability [219,220]. In a
mouse model of AD curcumin improved working memory
and cued memory functions [221].
Despite its long-established health effects, RCTs of
curcumin in humans are limited. A recent review by
Kuszewski et al. [222] reported on only ﬁve RCTs, in
which only two were found to demonstrate a signiﬁcant
improvement in working memory after supplementation.
The ﬁrst of these [223] reported signiﬁcant enhancements
on the N-back task 6 h following a 1 g dose of turmeric in
adults with untreated prediabetes. The second [224] also
found signiﬁcant acute effects of a single dose of 80 mg
curcumin on working memory, as well as a trend toward
improved sustained attention in healthy older adults. The
effects on working memory were also signiﬁcant after
chronic supplementation for 4 weeks.
Of the three trials in the above-mentioned review that
did not report signiﬁcant ﬁndings, two were conducted in
patients with AD [225,226]. As highlighted by Kuszewski
et al. [222] most of the participants in these studies were
taking medication for AD, which may have already been
slowing the progression of the disease and therefore may
have masked any beneﬁt of curcumin supplementation. A
further possibility is that curcumin supplementation may
not be effective in the more advanced stages of AD. The
three trials that did not ﬁnd differences between curcumin
and placebo aimed to assess changes in cognitive decline
using the MMSE [225,226] or MoCA [227] over longer
periods of time. However, it is possible that either the time
frame studied or the measures used were insufﬁcient to
detect changes in cognitive decline, since no changes were
observed in the placebo groups.
Other factors that may explain the lack of beneﬁcial
effect of curcumin in these studies are the doses used and
the bioavailability of curcumin. The two studies that did
report positive effects of curcumin [223,224] used lower
doses of curcumin than those that did not (which admin-
istered doses of up to 4000 mg/day). Higher attrition rates
were apparent in these studies due to an increased rate of
gastrointestinal problems associated with the higher doses.
This may have affected the statistical power of the trials. It
is also possible that the optimal dose of curcumin is in the
range used by Lee et al. [223] and Cox et al. [224].
Bioavailability of curcumin is poor and the two studies that
measured plasma curcumin detected little or no free
curcumin [225,226]. Cox et al. [224] used a curcumin
formulation with enhanced bioavailability and did report
beneﬁcial effects on cognition. Formulations such as this
may therefore increase the potential for curcumin to
enhance cognition.
Several animal studies have demonstrated cognitive-
enhancing properties of resveratrol. Learning and memory
as assessed using passive avoidance paradigms and the
elevated plus maze were improved in a rat model of AD
following chronic injection with trans-resveratrol [228].
These cognitive effects were accompanied by an increase in
brain glutathione and a smaller elevation in brain MDA
compared with vehicle-treated rats, indicating that trans-
resveratrol was able to reduce lipid peroxidation. Resver-
atrol also improved working memory and spatial memory
in primates [229], and spatial memory in mice [230].
In human research, regular wine drinkers in an older
adult French population have been shown to have up to
50% lower risk of developing dementia [231]. This is
supported by a cohort study in which monthly and weekly
intake of wine was associated with a reduced risk of
dementia 15 years after assessment of alcohol intake [232].
It is thought that this ﬁnding may be due to the high
resveratrol content in red wine.
Findings from clinical trials have been mixed, with
Marx et al. [233] reporting that 5 of the 10 studies included
in their systematic review found signiﬁcant improvements
in some measures of cognition including overall cognitive
performance [234], word retention [235], and semantic and
verbal memory [234]. The remainder showed either no
signiﬁcant ﬁndings or mixed effects, such as Scholey et al.
[236] and Wightman et al. [237] who reported both lower
serial
subtraction
tests
compared with controls. Pooled data revealed a signiﬁcant
effect of resveratrol on delayed recognition and negative
mood (although with low effect sizes) but no other cogni-
tive domains [233]. The trials with longer intervention
periods
generally
provided
more
positive
ﬁndings,
suggesting that long-term supplementation with resveratrol
may be needed in order to see cognitive effects. Small
sample sizes and insufﬁcient statistical power to detect
cognitive changes may also explain the inconsistent
ﬁndings in these trials.
In their review, Berman et al. [238] reported on two
phase 2 clinical trials that provided evidence for the ability
of resveratrol to alter AD biomarkers in patients with mild
to moderate AD. Patients treated with resveratrol for 1 year
had reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9),
an enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix and is
associated with AD, as well as lower accumulation of
b-amyloid in the brain.
In an RCT of 22 healthy adults, while resveratrol dose-
dependently increased cerebral blood ﬂow to the prefrontal
cortex during cognitive task performance, cognitive function
was not signiﬁcantly improved [239]. Farzaei et al. [169]


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 89

conducted a metaanalysis of four clinical trials investigating
the cognitive effects of resveratrol and also concluded that
while there was potential for resveratrol to enhance mood,
there was no signiﬁcant effect on memory and cognition
assessed using auditory verbal learning tests. However, the
heterogeneity of measures used across the four studies limits
the opportunity to detect effects in these studies. The authors
suggest that the lack of positive effect in humans may be due
to the poor bioavailability of resveratrol as well as interin-
dividual variability which results in inconsistent therapeutic
responses. They also suggest that coadministration of
resveratrol with other phenolic compounds may enhance its
bioefﬁcacy.
The cognitive-enhancing actions of resveratrol may not
be solely due to its antioxidant properties. As highlighted by
Sharma and Gupta [228] resveratrol is known to down-
regulate COX-2 and nitric oxide synthase through suppres-
sion of NF-kB activity, resulting in antiinﬂammatory
activity [240]. There is also evidence that resveratrol
protects against apoptotic cell death [241]. These activities
along with the antioxidant activity of resveratrol suggest
numerous underlying mechanisms through which it may
exert cognitive-enhancing effects.
The safety, tolerability, and nontoxicity of low doses of
curcumin are well established. Curcumin is a component of
the spice turmeric, which is used to ﬂavor foods such as
curries and is widely consumed as part of the diet around
the world, but particularly in South Asian countries such as
India. The United States Food and Drug Administration has
approved curcumin as being GRAS. However, high doses
of curcumin may be associated with gastrointestinal
problems [222]. In their trial of 36 participants, Ringman
et al. [226] concluded that curcumin was generally well
tolerated, although three participants withdrew due to
gastrointestinal symptoms. In a 12-month study, 23 out of
96 participants reported gastrointestinal symptoms [227]. In
a dose-escalation study including doses ranging from 500
to 12,000 mg, seven of the 24 participants who completed
the trial experienced minimal toxicity. The symptoms
experienced included diarrhea, headache, rash, and yellow
stool [242]. Furthermore, doses of up to 3.6 g per day
were associated with nausea (1 participant) and diarrhea (2
participants), as well as elevated serum alkaline phospha-
tase
lactate
dehydrogenase,
suggesting
undesirable effects on the liver and/or tissue damage [243].
In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, 8 g per day
curcumin was associated with intractable abdominal pain
suggesting this dose may not be suitable for use in patients
with this condition [244].
Resveratrol is nontoxic and generally well tolerated by
humans [98]. Marx et al. [233] reported in their systematic
review and metaanalysis of 10 studies involving a total of
372 participants that resveratrol was not associated with
any AEs. While preclinical evidence looked promising,
resveratrol was found to cause severe AEs in patients with
multiple myeloma [245]. However, in a study of patients
affected by type II diabetes, 8 weeks’ supplementation with
800 mg/day resveratrol was well tolerated and no serious
AEs were reported [189]. In their review of the therapeutic
potential of resveratrol, Berman et al. [238] concluded that
consumption by patients with mild to moderate AD is safe
and well tolerated, but that detrimental effects may be
observed in patients with schizophrenia.
While antioxidants may not always be effective when
administered in isolation, it is possible that some of those
discussed above may have a synergistic effect. Beneﬁcial
effects of combination formulas containing more than a
single nutraceutical have been demonstrated in numerous
studies,
supporting
idea
[158].
Furthermore,
suggested by Pratico [58] and Schrag et al. [61] the best
approach may be to ﬁrst assess which (if any) antioxidants
an individual is deﬁcient in and use titrated dosing of these
antioxidants only.
Pratico [58] also highlights that the antioxidant prepa-
rations used in many studies to date may not be selective
enough to have effects on the brain. Future research should
focus on molecules that can be easily delivered to neuronal
cells, or formulations that will increase bioavailability of
compounds in order that they can target speciﬁc sources of
ROS, such as mitochondria.

Ayurvedic principles of brain health
Presence of the mind and its faculties such as knowledge,
intelligence (Buddhi), higher wisdom (Viveka), etc., are
being referred since ancient times in various literatures in
one or other form as mythological stories, preachings,
chantings in Rigveda, Yogavasishta, Gita, Dwaparaand,
Viveka choodamani in Kaliyug, and Vishnu Puranam [23].
The word Veda is derived from the root “Vid,” which
means, “to know.” The essence of all the Vedas is found in
Upanishad, where references of cognition are mentioned as
“the path of Knowledge.” Bhela samhita considered the
brain as the center of “mind,” which he said is the highest
of all senses, and has denoted its anatomical place. It also
distinguishes between manas (mind) the cause of cognition,
with its seat in the brain, and the chitta (consciousness) as
the cause of all activities with its seat in the heart; and
buddhi (intellect) as a special function of the chitta (con-
sciousness) [74].
According to Sushrut Samhita, in the ﬁfth month
pregnancy
mind
gets
exhibited
clearly,
becomes more active and alert. The mana of fetus becomes
enlightened and consciousness develops, and it becomes
more sajiva (capable of living independently). Develop-
ment of fetal intellectual capacity takes place in the sixth
month of pregnancy [55].
Ayurveda mentions Buddhi as the intellectual capacity
responsible for the decisions by virtue of “Dhee” (percep-
tion of true knowledge) and “hriti” (sense to distinguish
good and bad). A healthy mind can distinguish good and
bad and act accordingly [61].
A comprehensive knowledge of constitution of an in-
dividual is required for treatment. Therefore, the concept of
purusha, i.e., holistic human being comprising of the self
(atma or soul), consciousness, the logical body, and mind
needs to be understood ﬁrst. Ayurveda talks about these in
a much detailed way covering the concepts of human
evolution, physical being, spirituality, and mental health. It
describes the 6 constituents (shad-dhatu), 24 constituents,
the ideal for treatment (chikitsya purusha), the souldits
origin and proof of existence, minddits description, exis-
tence, and the pathway to knowledge. While enlisting the

factors of the diseases the concept of intellectual error,
desire as the ultimate cause of sorrow, and the remedy are
discussed. Purusha includes 24 elements comprising of
mind, sensory and motor organs (10 indriyas), ﬁve objects
of sense organs (ether, air, water, ﬁre, earth) and prakriti
(consisting of eight components such as ﬁve mahabhutas
(in their subtle form), ego (ahamkara), intellect (mahan),
and primordial element (avyakta).
Mana (mind)
Ayurveda has mentioned mind as a separate sense organ. The
signs of existence of mind can be felt by virtue of its objects
and actions. Attention, determination, development of
thoughts, and any conceptualization needs mind to be
perceived. While the control of sense organs, self-check,
hypothesizing, and considerations represent the action of the
mind, the end result establishes as intellect (Buddhi). While
perceiving, our ﬁve senses passes on the object items to the
lower mind (Mann) which controls choices, emotions, and
feelings. Lower mind passes on the object description to
intelligence (Buddhi) which controls discrimination, deci-
sion, thought, and rationality. The ﬁnal observation is made
at Chitta, the basic faculty through which mind operates and
controls higher wisdom (Viveka) [54].
Whenever there is no contact of the mind with sense
organs and with their respective objects, ignorance prevails.
And when the path of contact is maintained, understanding
develops. The respective intellect drives to speak or act
intelligently. This concept is mentioned in Ayurveda as
Panchpanchak (Table 7.1).
Manas is deﬁned as “a substance which is responsible
for the presence or absence of the Knowledge.” Purposeful
thought, hypothesis (Uhya), attention (Dhyeya) and deter-
mination (Sankalp), happiness, miseries, etc., are the ob-
jects of the mind [59].
Mind is having two unique propertiesdSubtleness
(Anutva) and Oneness (Ekatva) [58]. Because of these
properties the mind can travel with great speed without even
being perceived. Sometimes we feel that we are using and
seeing and talking simultaneously but actually it is not so.
Another example is that when a garland of leaves is made,
only one leaf is punctured at one time. However, when we
pierce, it appears that many leaves are punctured together.
The fact is at one particular time only one leaf is punctured.
Similarly, the mind travels so fast in various directions that it
appears that all the things are perceived together. Manas
travels in such a high speed that we are not able to differ-
entiate that actually one action is taking in one time.
All the functions of the body are controlled by manas
with brain as the location of its ofﬁce and heart as
residence. Therefore, whenever Ayurveda talks about brain
health actually it talks about health of mind.
There are many factors which are responsible for
development of various psychological disorders [22,31]:
1. Due to the imbalance in the basic principle elements of
the body and mind: The imbalance of three humors of
body, i.e., vata, pitta, and kapha (Sharirik dosh vikrati)
and the Manasa dosha (psychological factors) rajas
and tamas lead to various disruptions including vataj,
pittaj, kaphaj, and sannipataj (mixed) types of mental
2. Behavior contrary to wisdom or improper use of the
intellect (Pragyaparadha): Pragyparadha (intellectual
irreverence) is a misconduct by verbal, mental, or
physical deeds against your own intellect, i.e., nonju-
dicious and knowingly doing the activities which are
harmful to the body or mind. These may include
excessive (Atiyoga), deﬁcient (Hina-Yoga), and incor-
rect (Mithya Yoga) forms of actions.
3. Improper control of instincts (Anuchit bramhacharya):
The conﬂict between the right and wrong deeds during
the process of indriya nigraha (control of instincts/
senses) leads to inner/self-blaming ridden phase which
causes various mental disparity.
4. Weak physiognomies (Durbal satva and Sharir):
Because of the incapability due to weak physical and
mental structure people suffer toward unwanted un-
bearable burden of self-guilt, which leads to metal out-
bursts and disorders.
5. Substances affecting the body and mind (Sharir evam
Manobhighat karan dravya): Any type of addiction
causing a habitual dependency and misuse gradually
starts injuring mind and body. In due course, this be-
comes a part of life and damages the system.
6. External factors (Agantuj karan): Any external factors
related to environment entering the body, e.g., infections,
evil spirits.
7. Improper and incompatible food and lifestyle (Anuchit
evam Virrudh aaharvihar).
8. Improper and harmful conjunction of sense organs
with their respective senses or improper contact of
the senses with their respective objects (Asatmendriar-
thasamyoga): These may be caused due to Atiyoga,
i.e., overindulgence of sense organs with the respec-
tive objects, Heena Yoga, i.e., poor association of
sense organs with their objectsdinsufﬁcient, inade-
quate, contact or noncontact with the objects of senses
with their respective sense organs and Mithya Yoga,
i.e., wrong indulgence with sense organs.

9. Not controlling the mental suppressible urges (Man-
shik Dharniya vega): Few inherent mental urges at
times become uncontrollable which otherwise need
to be controlled and suppressed, or they may lead to
disequilibrium and disturbances. For example, greed,
grief, fear, anger, vanity, shamelessness.
10. Loss of the essence of tissue (Ojokshaya): Excessive
loss may lead to proneness of many diseases. Improper
sleep (Ayukta nidra): Excessive or less sleep at inap-
propriate time also leads to mental illnesses.
Brain type Prakriti (constitution) basis the
mental, behavioral, and emotional
characteristics
Ayurveda mentions three classes of fundamental bio-
regulatory principles (doshas) which constitute an integral
part of human body and mind. These are called Vata, Pitta,
and Kapha. Vata dosha includes all the processes respon-
sible for physiological movements including conductions.
Vata also regulates the movements of Kapha and Pitta
inside the body. Pitta dosha is responsible for all the
processes,
thermoregulation,
homeostasis,
vision, etc. Kapha dosha is accountable for anabolism,
growth, maintenance, and stability. Both physical and
mental health revolve around the balance and imbalance of
these basic principles inside the body. All the mental
functioning, emotional and behavioral responses, and social
relationships depend upon the characteristics of these dos-
has inside each individual.
The brain types can thus be categorized as predominant
of these three doshas responsible for different patterns of
brain and nervous system functioning. The mental per-
sonality of an individual is considered from its Manas
guna, i.e., Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Sattvaguna is meant
for Kalyanamsa (good positive traits), Rajoguna for
Rosamsa (wilderness), and Tamoguna for Mohamsa (a
state of infatuation) [64]. It is also affected by Vata, Pitta,
and Kapha. Vata individuals are cowardly, unstable, feeble
with grief, agonized with grief (cherishing to humble per-
sons), thankless. Pitta individuals are bold, good orators,
and naughty, and Kapha individuals are bold, steady and
ﬁrm, forgiving, devoted and faithful, forbearing in nature,
energetic [63].
The main functions of the mind are control or direction
of sense faculties and restraining itself, perception through
senses, and discriminatory power of acceptance or rejection
[60]. To understand the individual differences, the charac-
teristics of different brain types need to be described. Vata
dosha is unstable, variable, and moves fast which would
get associated with a greater range of functioning of the
brain and nervous system. They are characterized by quick
performing of activities, fast learning, forgetting, and like to
do multitasking. Pitta dosha characterized by energy is
associated with fast, passionate responses of the brain
complex system to external challenges. This leads the
individuals to be purposeful, ﬁrm, dynamic, and goal
oriented. Kapha dosha on the other hand is characterized
by calmness and control, and is associated with steady
activity patterns of the brain and nervous system. It leads to
methodical thinking and action [72,9,62].
The other characteristics of these brain-types are
mentioned in Table 7.2:

Brain diseases in Ayurveda - Manas
roga
There are various features of Mental disease (Manas roga)
which comprise of the causative factors, types of mental
characteristics, bio-regulating principles, cognitive aspects,
and the treatment. (Fig. 7.1) These facets describe the
principles of the etiology and management of manas roga
[73,2,57].
Insanity/Psychosis/Mania (Unmada)
Mind is a Seat of Diseases. Diseases affect both mind and
body and the effect manifests as psychosomatic disorders.
Insanity/Psychosis/Mania (Unmada) is the disorder or
toxicity of the mind. It is caused by aggravation of various
bioregulating principles (doshas) and traveling to separate
directions through the microchannels (Srotas). This leads to
functional disturbances in the primary location (heart) and

the areas of brain causing distortion in the mind. Unmada
has components related to the deformity of mind, will, and
intellect. It may distort the will-power and thinking pattern,
delusions, hallucinations, inactivity, passiveness, paranoid
reactions, and depressions.
The causative factors may be enumerated as intake of
incompatible, contaminated, and unwanted food; malad-
aptation; wrong and unlawful activities; exaggeration of
primary instincts such as lust (kama), anger (krodha), greed
(lobha), pride (mada), desire (moha), and jealousy (mat-
sar), insulting the respectable people, mental shock,
excessive fear, unusual excitement due to happiness and
demonological possessions.
It is classiﬁed into various types due to affection of
internal factors due to bodily humors and external factors
such as poison, evil spirits, mental shock, etc (Fig. 7.2).
Vataj Unmad is caused due to vitiation of Vata dosha.
The features manifest as unwanted irrelevant talks and
movement of the body, discoloration of face to red, ema-
ciation, roughness, and impaired thought. Pittaj Unmad is
caused due to vitiation of Pitta dosha. The features
manifests as impatience, aggressions, agitations, tendency
of liking coldness and shade. Kaphaj Unmad is caused due
to aggravation of Kapha dosha. It reﬂects as sleepiness,
inactivity, passiveness, excessive desires, and secretions.
Sannipataj Unmad is due to all the three doshas and shows
a mixed type of symptoms. Mental shock (Chitta Ghataj/
shokaj unmad): It is caused due to any unpleasant or bad
news or activity affecting the individual. Untimely episodes
of laughing, crying, singing, unconsciousness, irrelevant
talking to self are the prime features. Due to poison (Visaj
Unmad): It is caused due to any kind of toxin. The indi-
vidual presents with eyes turning red; loss of strength,
sense, and lustre; face turning dark and full of sorrow.
Ayurveda believed in the concept of Graha or Bhoota as
the evil spirit that affects the people and possession syn-
drome/possession of evil (graaha-badha) is considered as
psychiatric disorder in weak-minded people driven by the
guilt complex. The person who suffers from excessive power
of talking, strength, libido, multi-tasking, and does not
realize the genesis of disease is known to have Bhootaj
Unmad. The individual unlike his/her nature when starts

behaving like a saint or priest, speaks and chants the
different slokas, and develops a staring look, then it is
Devagrahayukta Unmad. Danavgrahayukta person has
excessive perspiration, speaks bad about the respectable
people, squint looks, not scared at all, and always unsatisﬁed
with the food. The Gandhavagrahayukta unmad person
behaves like a dancer, loves singing, garlands, stays happy,
loves to roam waterside, and too much soft-spoken. The
Yakshagrahayukta individual presents with red eyes, is
serious-natured, loves and wears red color, thin, long
clothes, mild-spoken, tries to give something always. The
Pittagrahayukta unmad person always keeps reminding the
ancestral stories and loves to perform the last rites for his
ancestors, loves to eat meat, sesame, jiggery, and rice boiled
in milk. The Sarpagraphayukta unmad imitates the snake,
crawling and extends the tongue. They become violent and
love to eat and drink jaggery, honey, milk, and rice boiled in
milk. The rakshashgrahayukta unmad person loves to drink
wine and eat nonvegetarian items; is shameless, rough and
tough, violent; and has strength. They love to roam in night
and love the dirtiness. Pishachgraha unmad present themself
by making a posture by raising both the hands. They are
having foul body odor; are lean and thin, dirty, ﬁckle-
minded; and love to travel in lonely marshy places in nights.
Apasmara is mentioned as psychic disorder in Ayur-
veda that is caused due to impaired activity of Rajas (ac-
tivity) and Tamas (darkness and destruction); manifests as
convulsive disorder with transient loss of memory.
Vishaada is one of the Vatananatmaja Vikaras and is an
important aggravating factor formost of diseases. It is a
condition originating from apprehension of failure leading
to lackof initiation for any activity. The above presentation
is comparable with anxiety with depression.
AnidraisthesleepdisordercausedbyaggravatedVataand
Pitta. It is characterized by difﬁculty in falling asleep at
bedtime, waking up at night, and having difﬁculty going back
to sleep leading to daytime fatigue and loss of concentration.

Ayurvedic herbs in brain health-
medhya rasayan herbs
The word “medhya rasayanas” literally means cognition
rejuvenators. They are derived from the Sanskrit words
“medhya” i.e., intellect or cognition, and “rasayana” i.e.,
“rejuvenation.” There are few herbs classiﬁed in Ayurveda
as brain tonics or intellect promoters. The category
mentioned by the saint Charak as “medhya rasayanas” in-
cludes Centella asiatica (mandukparni) juice (swaras),
Glycyrrhiza glabra (Yashtimadhu) powder (churna) with
milk (ksheer), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) juice (swa-
ras) and Convolvulus pluricaulis (Shankhapushpi) aste
(kalka). The frequency analysis of the herbs which are
useful in mental diseases from the various marketed
formulation is mentioned in Table 7.4. The selected single
ingredient from the Ayurvedic pharmacopeia of India
which is having a role in maintaining cognitive functioning
and useful in the management of mental diseases is

Scientiﬁc evidences on selected medhya
rasayana herbsdpharmacological and clinical
studies
Bacopa monnieri linn. (Brahmi)
Chaudhari et al. reviewed the neuroprotective potential of
Brahmi. Brahmi was seen to protect the cholinergic neu-
rons
anticholinesterase
promote
neuronal cell protection and free radical scavenger mech-
anisms in Alzheimer disease. It also reduces hippocampal
b-amyloid
deposition and stress-induced
damage, lipid peroxidation, increases glutathione peroxi-
dase and chelates iron. It reverses the phenytoin-induced
memory impairment in experimental model [10].
Singh and Dhawan studied the effects of brahmi
(B. monnieri Linn.) on the learning performance of rats in
conditioning
schedules
administering
aqueous suspension of alcoholic extract (40 mg/kg, p.o.)
for three or more days. The ﬁrst schedule induced a labile
shock-motivated
brightness-
discrimination reaction. The brahmi-treated group showed
better acquisition, improved retention, and delayed extinc-
tion (P is less than .01e.05). Similarly, in an active
conditioned
ﬂight
reaction,
drug-treated
animals
showed a shorter reaction time than the controls (P less
than .01). Also in the continuous avoidance response the
drug-treated group performed better than the controls (P
less than .01e.05). The Bacopa treated group showed
signiﬁcantly better acquisition, improved retention, delayed
extinction, and faster reaction times than controls. This
conﬁrmed
claims
indicated
B. monnieri can improve the performance of rats in various
learning situations [67].
Vollala et al. conducted the study to see the effect of
B. monnieri on the dendritic morphology of neurons in the
basolateral amygdala responsible for learning and memory.
Wistar rats aged 2½ months old were divided in treatment
groups as into 2, 4, and 6 week and in 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg
per dose groups and age matched to controls. All the 24
treated rats and age-matched control rats were exposed to
spatial learning (T-maze) and passive avoidance tests.
Basolateral amygdaloid neurons were traced using camera
lucida, and dendritic branching points and intersections
were quantiﬁed post decapitation. The results suggested an
improvement in spatial performance and enhanced memory
retention in rats treated with B. monnieri extract as
compared to that of the control. Signiﬁcant increase in
dendritic length and branching points within the basolateral
amygdala were also observed in certain doses. This sug-
gests
neuronal
dendritic
growth-
stimulating properties [76].
The anticonvulsant phenytoin adversely affects cogni-
tive function, which results in epileptic patients suffering
impairments.
Vohora
B. monnieri alone and in combination with phenytoin on
passive-avoidance task, maximal electroshock seizures, and
locomotor activity in mice. Phenytoin (25 mg/kg p.o. for
14 days) adversely affected cognitive function in the pas-
sive avoidance task. Bacopa extract in a dose of 40 mg/kg
p.o. for 7 days signiﬁcantly reversed phenytoin-induced
memory impairment. Both memory acquisition and reten-
tion showed improvement without affecting phenytoin’s
anticonvulsant activity. This suggest the potential correc-
tive effect of Bacopa in cognitive deﬁcit associated with
phenytoin therapy [77].
Saini et al. studied the neuroprotective potential of
B. monnieri in colchicine-induced dementia. Cognitive
impairment was induced in rats by intracerebroventricular
administration of colchicine (15 mg/5 mL) which was
assessed by elevated plus maze. There was signiﬁcant in-
crease in levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein
carbonyls suggestive of oxidative stress and decrease in
activity of antioxidant enzymes in colchicine-treated ani-
mals. Bacopa in a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight supple-
mentation reversed memory impairment observed in the
colchicine-treated rats. It also reduced the oxidative dam-
age, by decreasing the LPO and protein carbonyl levels and
restoration of antioxidant enzyme activity. Bacopa also
restored
bound
enzymes
(Na þ Kþ ATPase and AChE) which were altered in
colchicine-treated brain regions These ﬁndings gave the
indication of Bacopa’s therapeutic potential in the treat-
ment of Alzheimer diseaseeassociated cognitive function
decline [53].
Stough C et al. examined the chronic effects of an
extract of B. monnieri (Keenmind) on cognitive function in
subjects
double-blind
placebo-
controlled independent group design study. The study
subjects received either B. monnieri (300 mg) or placebo.
Neuropsychological testing was conducted pre-(baseline)
12 weeks
post
administration.
B. monnieri signiﬁcantly improved speed of visual infor-
mation processing measured by the IT task, learning rate,
consolidation
measured
AVLT
(P < .05), and state anxiety (P < .001) compared to pla-
cebo, with maximal effects evident after 12 weeks. These
ﬁndings suggest that B. monnieri may improve higher order
cognitive processes that are critically dependent on the
input of information from our environment such as learning
and memory [69].
Peth-Nui T et al. aimed to determine the effect of
B. monnieri on attention, cognitive processing, working
memory, and cholinergic and monoaminergic functions in
healthy elderly. A randomized double-blind placebo-
controlled design was utilized. Sixty healthy elderly sub-
jects (mean age 62.62 years; SD 6.46), consisting of 23

activities. Working memory was assessed using percent
accuracy and reaction time of various memory tests as
indices, whereas attention and cognitive processing were
assessed using latencies and amplitude of N100 and P300
components of event-related potential. All assessments

improved working memory together with a decrease in both
N100 and P300 latencies. The suppression of plasma AChE
activity was also observed. These results suggest that
B. monnieri can improve attention, cognitive processing,
and working memory partly via the suppression of AChE
activity [43].
Kumar N et al. studied the effect of B. monnieri on
memory of medical students with 6 weeks’ administration
in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled non-
crossover, parallel trial. Sixty medical students of either
gender from second year of medical school, third term,
regular batch, were enrolled from Government Medical
College, Nagpur, India. Baseline biochemical and memory
tests were done. The participants were randomly divided in
two groups to receive either 150 mg of standardized extract
of B. monnieri or matching placebo twice daily for
6 weeks. All baseline investigations were repeated at the
end of the trial. Students were followed up for 15 days after
the intervention. Statistically signiﬁcant improvement was
seen in the tests relating to the cognitive functions with use
of B. monnieri. Blood biochemistry also showed a signiﬁ-
cant increase in serum calcium levels (still within normal
range) [37].
Downey LA et al. aimed to assess the acute effects of a
speciﬁc extract of B. monnieri in a double-blind, placebo-
controlled study in normal healthy participants who
completed a cognitively demanding series of tests. Twenty-
four healthy volunteers completed six repetitions of the
Cognitive Demand Battery (CDB) after consuming a pla-
cebo, 320 mg B. monnieri or 640 mg of B. monnieri in a
crossover design and provided cardiovascular and mood
assessments before and after treatment. Change from
baseline
scores
indicated
320 mg
B. monnieri improved performance at the ﬁrst, second, and
fourth repetition post-dosing on the CDB, and the treat-
ments had no effect upon cardiovascular activity or in
attenuating task-induced ratings of stress and fatigue. It was
concluded that assessment of an earlier pharmacological
window and use of less memory-speciﬁc cognitive tests
together with more temporally sensitive measures of brain
activity may improve our understanding of the acute neu-
rocognitive properties of B. monnieri [18].
Kean JD et al. systematically reviewed to assess and
critically summarize clinical trial outcomes and safety of
Bacopa and its effects on the cognition and behavior in
children and adolescents. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Li-
brary, Google, and CINAHL were searched up to August
2015 for trials investigating B. monnieri in child and
adolescent populations. There were no restrictions in study
design. Cognitive and behavioral outcomes were grouped
into validated constructs and effect sizes were calculated
for all signiﬁcant data to allow for direct comparisons. Five
studies met inclusion criteria for this review. The results
demonstrated signiﬁcant consistent improvements in the
language behavior cognitive domain and in a number of the
memory subdomains. Signiﬁcant improvements were also
seen in hyperactivity and attention-deﬁcit domains. Overall
outcome data demonstrated small to medium effect sizes
(mean d ¼ 0.42). Safety and tolerability data was well re-
ported for 80% of studies with only 2.3% of all participants
reporting mild side-effects. This review highlights the safe
use of B. monnieri in child and adolescent populations for
improving elements of cognition as well as behavior and
attention-deﬁcit domains. However, there is a signiﬁcant
need for replicated study designs and stringent statistical
analysis to validate these outcomes [33].
Kongkeaw C et al. conducted a metaanalysis to assess
its efﬁcacy of B. monnieri in improving cognitive function.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Cochrane Cen-
tral of clinical trial, WHO registry, Thai Medical Index,
Index Medicus Siriraj library, and www.clinicaltrial.gov
were searched from the inception date of each database to
June 2013 using scientiﬁc and common synonyms of
B. monnieri, cognitive performance or memory. The
reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed.
Randomized, placebo-controlled human intervention trials
on chronic 12 weeks dosing of standardized extracts of
B. monnieri without any co-medication were included in
this study. The methodological quality of studies was
assessed using Cochrane’s risk of bias assessment and
Jadad’s quality scales. The weighted mean difference and
95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) were performed using
random-effects
Dersimonian-Laird
method. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria using 518
subjects. Overall quality of all included trials was low risk
of bias and quality of reported information was high.
Metaanalysis of 437 eligible subjects showed improved
cognition by shortened Trail B test (17.9 ms; 95% CI
-24.6 to 11.2; P < .001) and decreased choice reaction
time (10.6 ms; 95% CI -12.1 to 9.2; P < .001). This
metaanalysis suggests that B. monnieri has the potential to
improve cognition, particularly speed of attention but only
a large well-designed “head-to-head” trial against an
existing medication will provide deﬁnitive data on its ef-
ﬁcacy on healthy or dementia patients using a standardized
preparation [34].

Raghav S et al. conducted a double-blind, placebo-
controlled randomized clinical study to evaluate the
efﬁcacy of standardized B. monnieri extract (SBME) in
subjects with age-associated memory impairment (AAMI)
without any evidence of dementia or psychiatric disorder.
The patients were given either 125 mg of SBME or placebo
twice a day for a period of 12 weeks followed by a placebo
period of another 4 weeks (total duration of the trial
16 weeks). Each subject was evaluated for cognition on a
battery of tests comprising mental control, logical memory,
digit forward, digit backward, visual reproduction, and
paired associate learning. SBME produced signiﬁcant
improvement on mental control and logical memory and
paired associated learning during the 12-week drug therapy.
SBME is efﬁcacious in subjects with age-associated
memory impairment [47].
Centella asiatica (Mandukaparni)
Gray et al. studied the effects of a water extract of Centella
asiatica on cognitive ability, as well as mitochondrial and
antioxidant response pathways in vivo. Learning and
memory was assessed in both mature and young C57BL/6
mice treated with Centella in the dose of 2 mg/mL using
Morris Water Maze (MWM). Tissue was collected and
gene expression was analyzed. Centella improved per-
formance in the MWM in aged animals unlike in young
group showing modest effect. The expression of mito-
chondrial and antioxidant response genes in the brain and
liver improved in both the groups. Expression of synaptic
markers was also increased in the hippocampus and frontal
cortex.

enhancing effect of Centella in healthy mice. The gene
expression changes suggest a possible effect on mito-
chondrial biogenesis, which in conjunction along with the
antioxidant response genes could contribute to cognitive
improvement [24].
Gray et al. published the effects of Centella asiatica
extract on a variety of cognitive tasks, synaptic density, and
mitochondrial and antioxidant pathways. CB6F1 mice were
treated with Centella asiatica extract (2 mg/mL) for
2 weeks prior to behavioral testing. Learning, memory, and
executive function were assessed using the novel object
recognition task (NORT), object location memory task
(OLM), and odor discrimination reversal learning (ODRL)
test. Tissue was collected for Golgi analysis of spine den-
sity, as well as assessment of mitochondrial, antioxidant,
and synaptic proteins. Centella asiatica extract improved
performance in all behavioral tests suggesting effects on
hippocampal and cortical dependent memory as well as on
prefrontal cortexemediated executive function. There was
also an increase in synaptic density in the treated animals,
which was accompanied by increased expression of the
antioxidant response gene and the mitochondrial marker
porin. This suggest that Centella asiatica is useful to
improve multiple facets of age-related cognitive impair-
ment [25].
Boondam et al. studied behavioral, cellular, and mo-
lecular effects on learning and memory enhancement with a
standardized extract of C. asiatica (ECa 233). ECa 233 was
given orally in a dose of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg to normal
rats twice a day for 30 days. MWM and performed acute
brain slice recording were used to test the spatial learning
and measure changes of synaptic plasticity in the hippo-
campus, a core brain region for memory formation,
respectively. Protein expressions (NR2A, NR2B, PSD-95,
BDNF,
TrkB)
plasticity
measured in hippocampus. Signiﬁcant increase in memory
retention and hippocampal long-term potentiation were
observed in 10 and 30 mg/kg doses; however, only the
30 mg/kg dose showed increased plasticity-related proteins.
There was an inverted U-shaped response of standardized
ECa 233 on memory enhancement; maximum increase in
the memory retention with an increase of synaptic plasticity
plasticity-related
proteins
observed in 30 mg/kg. This suggests the beneﬁcial effect on
memory retention of a standardized extract of Centella
asiatica [8].
Chiroma et al. investigated the protective role of Cen-
tella asiatica on D-gal/AlCl₃-induced cognitive deﬁcits in
rats. The groups were divided as donepezil 1 mg/kg/day,
Centella asiatica in dose of 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day
D-gal
60 mg/kg/day þ AlCl₃

10 weeks. Evaluation was done by MWM test and evalu-
ation of levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), phosphor-
ylated tau (P-tau), malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities
of superoxide dismutase (SOD), in the hippocampus and
cerebral cortex. The ultrastructure of the prefrontal cortex
of the rats’ was observed using transmission electron mi-
croscopy
(TEM).
D-gal/AlCl₃-treated
group
exhibited
cognitive deﬁcits, decreased activities of SOD, and marked
increase in AChE and MDA levels. Further, prominent
alterations in the ultrastructure of the prefrontal cortex were
noted. Coadministration of Centella asiatica with D-gal/
AlCl₃ improved cognitive impairment, decreased AChE
levels, attenuated the oxidative stress in hippocampus and
cerebral cortex, and prevented ultrastructural alteration of
neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Centella has shown pro-
tective effects across all the doses which were comparable
to donepezil. These ﬁndings suggest that Centella asiatica
reduced the cognitive deﬁcits in rats by restoring cholin-
ergic function, decreasing oxidative stress, and preventing
the morphological aberrations [12].
Tiwari S et al. studied the role of Centella asiatica in
managing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other age-
related problems in elderly. MCI is a problem which may
convert into Alzheimer’s disease in later stages. MCI is a
dilemma that is rising as we speak. It is a stage or symptom

of forgetfulness or cognitive impairment before reaching
dementia and Alzheimer disease. There is a rise of MCI
cases as early as people in the early forties. Although the
concept of MCI is based on the presence of speciﬁc
cognitive deﬁcits, several studies show that subjects with
MCI can develop depression and disruptive behavior
(e.g., agitation, aggression). The present study was con-
ducted in 60 elderly subjects of age group 65 and above
with written consent, registered at the geriatric outpatient
clinic at S.S. Hospital, BHU. The diagnostic tool used in
this study was Mini Mental State Examination. Also, pa-
rameters like Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Ac-
tivities of Daily living, and Yesavage Geriatric Depression
scale were used to monitor the subjects. Centella asiatica
aqueous extract was prescribed in a dose of 500 mg twice a
day (1000 mg daily) for 6 months. A favorable improve-
ment was observed in MCI along with other problems like
hypertension, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation [71].
Centella asiatica is reputed for its beneﬁcial effects in
various neurological disorders. The present investigation
was undertaken to evaluate the role of 70% hydroethanolic
extract of Centella asiatica on generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD) in man. Hamilton’s Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS) was used to screen the subjects. Thirty-three par-
ticipants (18 male and 15 female; average age 33 years)
were medicated with the C. asiatica in a ﬁxed dose regime
(500 mg/capsule, twice daily, after meal). They were

further signiﬁcantly (P < .01) improved the willingness for
adjustment and cognition. Results indicated that Centella
asiatica may be useful in the treatment of GAD and may be
used as a promising anxiolytic agent in near future [29].
Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. has been used as a herbal
brain tonic for mental disorders and enhancing memory, but
no review of the overall evidence of C. asiatica and
cognitive function has been conducted. This study aims to
determine the effects of C. asiatica on cognitive function
and its related properties. The current systematic review
includes ﬁve randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) con-
ducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica alone and six
RCTs conducted to determine the effect of C. asiatica-
containing products. Metaanalysis indicated that there are
no signiﬁcant differences in all cognitive function domains
of C. asiatica when compared to placebo. However, it
could improve mood by increasing alert scores [SMD: 0.71
(95% CI; 0.01 to 1.41); I2 ¼ 30.5%] and decreasing anger
scores at 1 h after treatment [SMD: 0.81 (95%CI; 1.51
to 0.09); I2 ¼ 36.6%]. None of the studies reported
adverse effects of C. asiatica. In conclusion, there is not
strong evidence to support the use of C. asiatica for
cognitive function improvement in each cognitive domain.
C. asiatica could improve alertness and relieve anger [46].
Wattanathorn J. et al. studied Centella asiatica to see
the effect on cognitive function of healthy elderly
volunteers as randomized, placebo-controlled, double-
blind study. Twenty-eight healthy elderly participants
received the plant extract at various doses ranging 250,
500, and 750 mg once daily for 2 months. Cognitive
performance was assessed using the computerized test
battery and event-related potential, whereas mood was
assessed using BondeLader visual analogue scales prior
to the trial and after single, 1, and 2 months after treat-
ment. The high dose of the plant extract enhanced working
memory and improved the self-rated mood. This suggests
the potential of Centella asiatica to attenuate the age-
related decline in cognitive function and mood disorder
in the healthy elderly [78].
Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy.
(Sankhapushpi)
Dhingra D and Valecha investigated the effect of different
fractions of ethanolic extract of C. pluricaulis on depres-
sion in mice. Swiss young male albino mice were treated
with petroleum ether (25, 50 mg/kg), chloroform (25, 50,
100 mg/kg), and ethyl acetate (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) fractions
orally for 10 successive days. Forced swim test (FST) and
tail suspension test (TST) were conducted to assess the
immobility periods. The antidepressantlike effect was
measured against reserpine (2 mg/kg i.p.), sulpiride (50 mg/
kg
i.p.),
prazosin
(62.5 mg/kg
i.p.),
p-
chlorophenylalanine (100 mg/kg i.p.). The antidepressant-
like effect was compared with that of imipramine (15 mg/
kg p.o.) and ﬂuoxetine (20 mg/kg p.o.). Only the chloro-
form fraction in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg signiﬁcantly
reduced the immobility time in both FST and TST, which
was comparable to that of imipramine and ﬂuoxetine
administered for 10 successive days. The chloroform frac-
tion reversed reserpine-induced extension of immobility
period. Prazosin, sulpiride, and p-chlorophenylalanine
signiﬁcantly reduced the chloroform fractioneinduced
antidepressantlike effect in TST. This is suggestive of
C. pluricaulis fraction to have antidepressantlike effect in
mice by interaction with the adrenergic, dopaminergic, and
serotonergic systems [17].
The neuroprotective effect of C. pluricaulis aqueous
extract (AE) was studied by Bihaqi et al. against scopol-
amine (1 mg/kg body weight [bwt])einduced neurotoxicity
in the cerebral cortex of male Wistar rats. Elevated plus

antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities were also
screened. The standard rivastigmine tartrate (1 mg/kg bwt)
was used. Convolvulus extract (150 mg/kg bwt) signiﬁ-
cantly reduced scopolamine-induced increase in the transfer
latency in EPM, whereas impairment of spatial memory
induced by scopolamine was improved in MWM. The
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity signiﬁcantly inhibited
activities of glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase,
and reduced glutathione within the cortex and hippocampus
were elevated. This suggests that C. pluricaulis exhibited
neuroprotective and can be useful in supporting the
cognitive functions [7].
Malik et al. compared the memory-enhancing, anxio-
lytic, antidepressant, and CNS-depressant activities of
shankhpushpi speciesdC. pluricaulis Chois, Evolvulus
alsinoides extract (EAE) and Clitoria ternatea extract. The

Saṅkhapuṣpı tablets prepared by three Bhavana (leviga-

Weschler’s memory scale was adopted to collect data
before (pre) and after (post) intervention period (2 months).
In auditory immediate test and delayed test, 41.03% and
48% improvement was found, which is statistically highly
signiﬁcant (<0.001). In visual immediate and delayed test
32.5% and 44.87% improvement were found, respectively,
which shows highly signiﬁcant result (<0.001). This
revealed that saṅkhapuṣpı tablet shows highly signiﬁcant

propoxur(2-isopropoxyphenyl
N-methylcarbamate)-induced acetylcholine esterase inhibi-
tion and impairment of cognitive function in rats. Male
Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Group I was
treated with olive oil and served as control. Group II was
administered orally with propoxur (10 mg/kg b.wt.) in olive
oil, group III received a combination of propoxur (10 mg/
kg b.wt.) and W. somnifera (100 mg/kg b.wt.) suspension
and group IV W. somnifera (100 mg/kg b.wt.) only. All
animals were treated for 30 days. Cognitive behavior was
assessed by transfer latency using EPM. Blood and brain
acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity was also assessed.
Oral administration of propoxur (10 mg/kg b.wt.) resulted
in a signiﬁcant reduction of brain and blood AChE activity.
A signiﬁcant prolongation of the acquisition, as well as
retention transfer latency, was observed in propoxur-treated
rats. Oral treatment of W. somnifera exerts protective effect
and attenuates AChE inhibition and cognitive impairment
caused by subchronic exposure to propoxur [79].
Baitharu et al. evaluated the neuroprotective and pro-
phylactic potential of W. somnifera root extract in
ameliorating hypobaric hypoxia (HH)einduced memory
impairment and to explore the underlying molecular
mechanism. W. somnifera root extract was administered to
male Sprague Dawley rats during a period of 21 days
preexposure and 07 days exposure to a simulated altitude
of 25,000 ft. Spatial memory was assessed by MWM.
Neurodegeneration, corticosterone, Ach levels, AchE ac-
tivity, oxidative stress markers, and nitric oxide (NO)
concentration were assessed in the hippocampus. Synaptic
and apoptotic markers were also investigated by immu-
noblotting. To study the role of NO in regulating
corticosterone-mediated signaling, the neuronal nitric ox-
ide synthase (n-NOS) inhibitor, L-nitro-arginine methyl
ester (L-Name), and NO agonist sodium nitroprusside
(SNP) were administered from third to seventh day of
hypoxic exposure. Administration of W. somnifera root
extract prevented HH-induced memory impairment and
neurodegeneration along with decreased NO, corticoste-
rone, oxidative stress, and AchE activity in hippocampal
region. Inhibition of NO synthesis by administration of
L-Name reduced corticosterone levels in hippocampus
during hypoxic exposure while coadministration of corti-
costerone increased neurodegeneration. Administration of
SNP along with WS root extract supplementation during
hypoxic exposure increased corticosterone levels and
increased the number of pyknotic cells. WS root extract
ameliorated HH-induced memory impairment and neuro-
degeneration

modulation of corticosterone levels [3].
Bhattacharya et al. investigated the anxiolytic and
antidepressant actions of the bioactive glycowithanolides
(WSG), isolated from W. somnifera roots, in rats. WSG
(20 and 50 mg/kg) was administered orally once daily for
5 days and the results were compared by those elicited by
the benzodiazepine lorazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) for anxi-
olytic studies, and by the tricyclic antidepressant, imip-

administered once, 30 min prior to the tests. WSG induced
an anxiolytic effect, comparable to that produced by lor-
azepam, in the EPM, social interaction, and feeding la-
tency in an unfamiliar environment test. Further, both
WSG and lorazepam reduced rat brain levels of tribulin,
an endocoid marker of clinical anxiety, when the levels
were increased following administration of the anxiogenic
agent, pentylenetetrazole. WSG also exhibited an antide-
pressant effect, comparable with that induced by imipra-
mine, in the forced swim-induced “behavioral despair”
and “learned helplessness” tests. The investigations sup-
port the use of WS as a mood stabilizer in clinical con-
ditions of anxiety and depression in Ayurveda [6].
Manjunath and Muralidhara tested the hypothesis that
W. somnifera prophylaxis could offset neurotoxicant-
dysfunctions
developing
employing a rotenone (ROT) mouse model. Initially, the
potential of WS oral supplements (100e400 mg/kg b.w/
day, 4 weeks) to modulate the endogenous levels of
oxidative markers in cerebellum (cb) and striatum (st) of
prepubertal (PP) mice were assessed. Further, the induction
of oxidative stress in cb and st of mice administered with
ROT (i.p. 0.5 and 1 mg/kg b.w, 7 days). ROT caused sig-
niﬁcant elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroperoxides (HP) and
NO levels in both brain regions were observed. ROT
caused signiﬁcant perturbations in the levels of reduced
glutathione (GSH), activity levels of antioxidant enzymes,
acetylcholinesterase, and mitochondrial dysfunctions sug-
gesting a state of oxidative stress. The protective effects of
W. somnifera root powder (400 mg/kg b.w/day, 4 weeks) in
PP mice challenged with ROT (0.5 mg/kg b.w/day, 7 days)
were studied. WS prophylaxis signiﬁcantly offset ROT-
induced oxidative damage in st and cb as evident by the
normalized levels of oxidative markers (MDA, ROS levels,
and HP) and restoration of depleted GSH levels. WS
effectively normalized the NO levels in both brain regions
suggesting its antiinﬂammatory action and restored the
activity levels of cytosolic antioxidant enzymes, neuro-
transmitter function, and dopamine levels in st. These
ﬁndings suggest that WS prophylaxis has the propensity to
modulate neurotoxicant-mediated oxidative impairments
and mitochondrial dysfunctions in speciﬁc brain regions of
mice [40].
Choudhary et al. conducted a pilot prospective, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 50
adults to evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of ashwagandha
(W. somnifera (L.) Dunal) in improving memory and
cognitive functioning in adults with MCI. Subjects were
treated with either ashwagandha-root extract (300 mg
twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of
study, the ashwagandha treatment group demonstrated

strated signiﬁcantly greater improvement in executive

(P ¼ .002), Wisconsin Card Sort test (P ¼ .014), Trail-
Making test part A (P ¼ .006), and the Mackworth
Clock test (P ¼ .009). Ashwagandha may be effective in
enhancing both immediate and general memory in people
with mild cognitive impairment, as well as improving
executive function, attention, and information processing
speed [13].
Jahanbakhsh et al. conducted a randomized double-
blind placebo-controlled trial to see the efﬁcacy of
W. somnifera root extract as an adjunct therapy to standard
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment. Thirty
patients with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of OCD according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision
(DSM-IV-TR)
criteria
participated in this clinical trial. They were randomly
assigned to the treatment group (W. somnifera extract,
120 mg/day; n ¼ 15) or the placebo group (n ¼ 15). All
patients were under treatment with Selective Serotonin
Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), and were instructed to take
four capsules of the extract or placebo per day, preferably
after meals, for a period of 6 weeks. The Yale-Brown
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used in or-
der to assess the severity of OCD symptoms at baseline and
at the end of the trial. Comparison of the change in Y-
BOCS score during the course of the trial revealed a
signiﬁcantly greater effect of W. somnifera (26 (14e40)
[pretreatment] versus 14 (4e40) [post-treatment]; change: 8
(23 to 0)) versus placebo (18 (11e33) [pretreatment]
versus 16 (10e31) [posttreatment]; change: 2 (4 to 0))
(P < .001). The extract was safe and no adverse event was
reported during the trial. W. somnifera extract may be
beneﬁcial as a safe and effective adjunct to SSRIs in the
treatment of OCD [28].
Pingali et al. conducted a prospective, double-blind,
multi-dose, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess
the cognitive and psychomotor effects of W. somnifera
extract in healthy human participants. 20 healthy male
participants were randomized to receive 250 mg capsules
(2) twice daily of an encapsulated dried aqueous extract of
roots and leaves of W. somnifera or a matching placebo for
a period of 14 days. Cognitive and psychomotor perfor-
mance was assessed pre-dose (day 1) and at 3 h post-dose
on day 15 using a battery of computerized psychometric
tests. After a washout period of 14 days, the subjects
crossed-over to receive the other treatment for a further

period of 14 days as per prior randomization schedule.
Same battery of test procedures were performed to assess
cognitive and psychomotor performance. Signiﬁcant im-
provements were observed in reaction times with simple
reaction, choice discrimination, digit symbol substitution,
digit vigilance, and card sorting tests with W. somnifera
extract compared to placebo. However, no effect can be
seen with the ﬁnger tapping test. W. somnifera extract can
improve cognitive and psychomotor performance and may,
therefore, be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of diseases
associated with cognitive impairment [44].
Chengappa et al. conducted a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized study to evaluate the cognitive ef-
fects of W. somnifera extract (WSE) in bipolar disorder.
Sixty euthymic subjects with DSM-IV bipolar disorder
were enrolled in an 8-week clinical study. WSE (500 mg/d)
as a procognitive agent was added to the medications being
used as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder as an
adjunct. Cognitive testing at baseline and 8 weeks assessed
primary efﬁcacy outcomes. Psychopathology and adverse
events were monitored at scheduled visits. Fifty-three
patients completed the study (WSE, n ¼ 24; placebo,
n ¼ 29), and the two groups were matched in terms of
demographic,
illness,
characteristics.
Compared to placebo, WSE provided signiﬁcant beneﬁts
for three cognitive tasks: digit span backward (P ¼ 0.035),
Flanker neutral response time (P ¼ 0.033), and the social
cognition response rating of the Penn Emotional Acuity
Test (P ¼ 0.045). The size of the WSE treatment effect for
digit span backward was in the medium range (Cohen
d ¼ 0.51; 95% CI, 0.25e0.77). Other cognitive tasks did
not show signiﬁcant between-group differences. Mood and
anxiety scale scores remained stable, and adverse events
were minor. W. somnifera appears to improve auditory-
verbal working memory (digit span backward), a measure
of reaction time, and a measure of social cognition in bi-
polar disorder [11].
Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi)
Sharma et al. investigated neuroprotective potential of
butanol extract of T. cordifolia (B-TCE) against glutamate-
induced excitotoxicity. Both in vitro and in vivo models
using primary hippocampal neurons and Wistar strain al-
bino rats. Molecular and behavioral parameters were also
studied. B-TCE treatment was also effective in prevention
of anxiety, cognition, and motor-coordination deﬁcits
induced by glutamate. B-TCE pretreatment protected the
neurons
glutamate-induced
degeneration and impaired plasticity. At molecular level,
decrease in overactivation of glutamate receptors, promo-
tion of upregulation of ERK and AKT pathways of synaptic
plasticity, and cell survival in the hippocampus region of
brain were noted with Tinospora pretreated condition.
Tinosporicide isolated from T. cordifolia was found to be
effective in in-vitro experiment against glutamate-induced
suggests
protective potential of T. cordifolia against glutamate-
induced excitotoxicity in hippocampus region [65].
Mishra et al. examined whether TCE can attenuate the
negative effects of sleep deprivation in rats. Three groups
of adult Wistar female ratsdvehicle treated-sleep undis-
turbed (VUD), vehicle treated-sleep deprived (VSD), and
T. cordifolia treated-sleep deprived (TSD) animals were
used. The animals were behaviorally tested for cognitive
functions, anxiety, and motor coordination. TSD animals
showed improved behavioral response in EPM and Novel
Object Recognition tests for anxiety and cognitive func-
tions, respectively, as compared to VSD animals. TCE
pretreatment modulated the stress-induced expression of
plasticity markers PSA-NCAM, NCAM, and GAP-43
along with proteins involved in the maintenance of LTP,
i.e., CamKII-a and calcineurin (CaN) in hippocampus and
PC regions of the brain. TSD group showed downregulated
expression of inﬂammatory markers such as CD11b/c,
MHC-1, and cytokines along with inhibition of apoptotic
markers. The study suggests that T. cordifolia alone or in
combination with other memory enhancing agents may
help in managing sleep deprivationeassociated stress and
improving cognitive functions [41].
Kosaraju et al. investigated the neuroprotective activity
of ethanol extract of T. cordifolia aerial parts against
6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rat model of Par-
kinson disease (PD). Experimental PD was induced by
intracerebral injection of 6-OHDA (8 mg). Animals were
divided into ﬁve groups: sham operated, negative control,
positive control (levodopa 6 mg/kg), and two experimental
groups (n ¼ 6/group). Experimental groups received 200
and 400 mg/kg of T. cordifolia extract once daily for
30 days by oral gavage. Biochemical parameters including
dopamine level, oxidative stress, complex I activity, and
brain iron asymmetry ratio and locomotor activity including
skeletal muscle coordination and degree of catatonia were
assessed. T. cordifolia extract exhibited signiﬁcant neuro-
protection by increasing the dopamine levels (1.96  0.20
and 2.45  0.40 ng/mg of protein) and complex I activity
(77.14  0.89 and 78.50  0.96 nmol/min/mg of protein)
at 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively, when compared with
negative control group. Iron asymmetry ratio was also
signiﬁcantly attenuated by TCEE at 200 (1.57  0.18) and
400 mg/kg (1.11  0.15), when compared with negative
control group. Neuroprotection by T. cordifolia was further
supported by reduced oxidative stress and restored loco-
motor activity in treatment groups. T. cordifolia possesses
signiﬁcant neuroprotection in 6-OHDA-induced PD by
protecting dopaminergic neurons and reducing the iron
accumulation [35].

Dhingra and Goyal examined the effect of petroleum
ether extract of T. cordifolia (Wild.) Miers on depression in
mice. The extract (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) was
administered for 14 successive days to Swiss young albino
mice (either sex) and evaluated for antidepressantlike ac-
tivity using tail suspension test and forced swim test.
T. cordifolia extract at all three doses produced signiﬁcant
antidepressantlike effect in tail suspension test as well as in
forced swim test, and their efﬁcacies were found to be
comparable to imipramine (15 mg/kg, p.o.) and sertraline
(20 mg/kg, p.o.). The extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg showed
most potent effect and did not show any signiﬁcant change
in locomotor functions of mice as compared to control. The
antidepressantlike effect of the extract was signiﬁcantly
reversed by pretreatment of animals with prazosin (a a(1)-
adrenoceptor antagonist), sulpiride (a selective dopamine
D(2)-receptor antagonist), p-CPA (a serotonin synthesis
inhibitor), and baclofen (GABA-B agonist), when tested in
tail suspension test. Moreover T. cordifolia extract also
reduced the mouse whole brain monoamine oxidase
(MAO-A and MAO-B) activities as compared to control,
resulting in increase in the levels of brain monoamines.
Thus, T. cordifolia possesses potential therapeutic value for
the management of depressive disorders [15].
Glycyrrhiza glabra (Yastimadhu)
Dhingra et,al investigated the effects of G. glabra on
learning and memory in mice. EPM and passive avoidance
paradigm were employed to test learning and memory.
Three doses (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg p.o.) of aqueous
extract of G. glabra were administered for seven successive
days in separate groups of animals. The dose of 150 mg/kg
of the aqueous extract of licorice signiﬁcantly improved
learning and memory of mice and signiﬁcantly reversed the
amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.) and scopol-
amine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.). Antiinﬂammatory and antioxidant
properties of licorice may be contributing favorably to the
memory enhancement effect. Because G. glabra reversed
the scopolamine-induced amnesia, it is possible that the
beneﬁcial effect on learning and memory may be due to
facilitation of cholinergic-transmission in mouse brain.
G. glabra was found to be potential as a memory enhancing
agent [16].
Glabridin was isolated from the roots of G. glabra and
its effects on cognitive functions and cholinesterase activity
were investigated in mice by Cui et al. Glabridin (1, 2, and
4 mg/kg, P. O.) and piracetam (400 mg/kg, i. p.), a clini-
cally used nootropic agent, were administered daily for
three successive days to different groups of mice. The
higher doses (2 and 4 mg/kg, P. O.) of glabridin and pira-
cetam signiﬁcantly antagonized the amnesia induced by
scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, I. P.) in both the EPM test and
passive avoidance test. Furthermore, glabridin (2 and 4 mg/
kg, P. O.) and metrifonate (50 mg/kg, I. P.), used as a
standard drug, both remarkably reduced the brain cholin-
esterase activity in mice compared to the control group. The
study suggested that glabridin appears to be a promising
candidate for memory improvement and may have the
potential to be used in the management of Alzheimer pa-
tients [14].
Hasanein investigated the effect of chronic treatment
with glabridin, major active ﬂavonoids in G. glabra (lico-
rice) on cognitive function in control and streptozotocin
(STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Animals were divided into
untreated control, glabridin-treated control (5, 25, and
50 mg/kg), untreated diabetic and glabridin-treated diabetic
(5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) groups. Passive avoidance learning
(PAL) and memory were assessed 30 days later after the
treatments. Diabetes caused cognition deﬁcits in the PAL
and memory paradigm. While oral glabridin administration
(25 and 50 mg/kg) improved learning and memory in
nondiabetic rats, it reversed learning and memory deﬁcits
of diabetic rats. Low-dose glabridin (5 mg/kg) did not alter
cognitive function in nondiabetic and diabetic groups. The
combination of antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anticho-
linesterase properties of glabridin may all be responsible for
the observed effects. This suggests that glabridin has the
potential to prevent the deleterious effects of diabetes on
learning and memory [27].
Singh et al. studied the effect of ﬂavonoid-rich fraction
of G. glabra root extract against phenytoin-induced
cognition deﬁcit in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindled mice.
The kindled mice in different groups were given 15 days
posttreatment with phenytoin (25 mg/kg; p.o.) per se or in
combination with varying doses of G. glabra fraction (5,
10, and 15 mg/kg; p.o.). Seizure severity score and cogni-
tive functions were accessed using Racine’s scale and
passive shock avoidance paradigm, respectively, on every
ﬁfth day after a PTZ challenge dose (35 mg/kg; i.p.). The
fraction showed marked antioxidant activity indicated by
low IC50 values in DPPH (20.9 mg/mL), nitric oxide
radical
scavenging
(195.2 mg/mL),
hydrogen
peroxide
scavenging
(3.4 mg/mL)
assays.
G. glabra pretreated animals showed signiﬁcant reduction
in seizure severity score as compared to vehicle control.
The G. glabraetreated groups also showed improved
cognitive functions indicated by reduced number of mis-
takes and increased step-down latency in passive shock
avoidance paradigm. G. glabra in combination with
phenytoin may be useful in reducing seizure severity and
improving cognitive functions [68].
Nardostachys jatamansi (Jatamansi)
Karkada et al. investigated the potential of N. jatamansi
extract (NJE) in protecting against chronic stresseinduced
impairments in spatial learning and memory. The rats were

## Page 122

exposed to 21 days of chronic restraint stress and simulta-
neously received 100 mg or 200 mg/kg body weight of
NJE. Acquisition and retention of hippocampus-dependent
spatial memory were tested in a partially baited eight arm
radial maze. Animals treated with 200 mg/kg body weight
NJE had learning curves comparable to control unstressed
animals, made signiﬁcantly more correct choices (38%,
P < .001), and fewer reference memory errors (53%,
P < .01) on the eighth day of training compared to un-
treated stressed animals as well as stressed animals which
received vehicle or a lower dose (100 mg/kg) of NJE. NJE-
treated animals also made signiﬁcantly higher correct
choices (31%, P < .001) than untreated animals in a
retention test 10 days after the training period. N. jatamansi
has a protective effect of stress-induced impairments in
hippocampus-dependent learning and memory behavior in
rats [32].
Ethanol extract of the roots of N. jatamansi DC.
(Valerianaceae) was studied for its anticonvulsant activity
and neurotoxicity, alone and in combination with phenytoin
in rats by Rao et al. A signiﬁcant increase in the seizure
threshold by N. jatamansi root extract against maximal
electroshock seizure (MES) model is indicated by a
decrease in the extension/ﬂexion (E/F) ratio. However, the
extract was ineffective against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-
induced seizures. N. jatamansi root extract also showed
minimal neurotoxicity against rotarod test at doses that
increased the seizure threshold. Further, pretreatment of rats
with phenytoin at doses of 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg in
combination with 50 mg/kg of N. jatamansi root extract
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the protective index (PI)
of phenytoin from 3.63 to 13.18. The dose response studies
of phenytoin alone and in combination with N. jatamansi
extract on the serum levels of phenytoin clearly demon-
strated the synergistic action of both the drugs [51].
Janardhanan et al. evaluated the efﬁcacy of the ethanolic
root extract of N. jatamansi, against ketamine-induced
schizophrenialike model in rats. N. jatamansi was given
as oral dosage of 500 mg/kg body weight for 14 days in
ketamine-administered male Wistar albino rats (30 mg/kg
body weight for 5 days) and the effects were studied on
modulating behavior and the level of neurotransmitters like
dopamine and glutamate in whole-brain homogenates. The
inﬂuence on brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropo-
myosin receptor kinase B levels in the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex was also assessed. N. jatamansi treatment
exhibited
encouraging
modulation
ketamine-induced schizophrenialike behaviors, principally
the positive symptoms. It signiﬁcantly upregulated the
glutamate level and downregulated the dopamine level in
whole-brain homogenates and retained the normal levels of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (in the hippocampus but
not in the prefrontal cortex) and tropomyosin receptor ki-
nase B (in both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex)
induced by ketamine in rats. The results are suggestive of
N.
jatamansi
ketamine-induced schizophrenialike symptoms in rats;
possibly, regarding its effect on tropomyosin receptor ki-
nase B signaling [30].
Lyle et al. evaluated the antistress effect of hydro-
ethanolic extract (70%) of N. jatamansi in reference to its
antioxidant property. Wistar rats were divided into four
groups: naive, stressed, and T-200 and T-500 stressed with
oral pretreatment of N. jatamansi 200 and 500 mg/kg,
respectively. Rats were restrained in metallic chambers for
4 h at 4C followed by sacriﬁce and assessment of stress-
induced alterations in biochemical parameters, incidence,
and severity of ulcers. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and NO
levels in stomach and LPO, NO levels and catalase activity
in brain, plasma corticosterone level, and adrenal ascorbic
acid were measured. In vitro antioxidant activity of
N. jatamansi was studied by measuring the free radical
scavenging activity. N. jatamansi showed potent antioxi-
dant activity and signiﬁcantly reversed the stress-induced
elevation of LPO and NO levels and decrease in catalase
activity in the brain. It inhibited the incidence of gastric
ulcerations and reversed the alterations in biochemical pa-
rameters/markers
gastric
ulceration.
N. jatamansi also signiﬁcantly altered stress-induced in-
crease in adrenal and spleen weights and decrease in level
of ascorbic acid in adrenal gland. Elevation of plasma
corticosterone level was negated dose-dependently. The
ﬁndings suggest that the N. jatamansi possesses signiﬁcant
antistress activity, which may be due to its antioxidant
activity [38].
Valeriana wallichii (Tagar)
Vishwakarma et al. investigated the neuroprotective effect
of V. wallichii containing valeric acid, and its possible
action
amelioration
intra-
cerebroventricular
streptozotocin-induced
degeneration in Wistar rats. The rhizomes of V. wallichii
were powdered coarsely and extracted by percolation
method using dichloromethane. Wistar rats (220e250 g) of
either sex were divided into ﬁve groups, comprising six
animals each. Valeric acid was isolated from plant extract
and characterized using FT-IR. Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) was
GABA-A
antagonist.
Intracerebroventricular
streptozotocin administration caused signiﬁcant (P < .05)
increase in escape latency, retention transfer latency on
morris water maze on 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th day and
EPM on 19th and 20th day, respectively, as compared to
normal untreated rats. Treatment with V. wallichii extract
100 and 200 mg/kg and valeric acid 20 and 40 mg/kg
signiﬁcantly decreased the escape latency and retention
transfer latency, as compared to intracerebroventricular-
streptozotocin group. Plant extract and valeric acid also

## Page 123

decreased the level of lipid peroxidation and restored
glutathione level in rat brains. Administration of picrotoxin
signiﬁcantly reversed the effects produced by plant extract
and valeric acid in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin
treated rats. The ﬁndings may conclude that valeric acid
present in V. wallichii has signiﬁcant GABAergic effect in
amelioration of experimental dementia [75].
Celastrus paniculatus Willd. (Jyotishmati)
Bhanumathy et al. studied the effect of C. paniculatus
Willd. (Celastraceae) seed aqueous extract on learning and
memory using EPM and passive avoidance test (sodium
nitrite-induced amnesia rodent model). The aqueous seed
extract was administered orally in two different doses to
rats (350 and 1050 mg/kg) and to mice (500 and 1500 mg/
kg). The results were compared to piracetam (100 mg/kg,
p.o.) used as a standard drug. Chemical hypoxia was
induced by subcutaneous administration of sodium nitrite
(35 mg/kg), immediately after acquisition training. In EPM
and sodium nitrite-induced amnesia model, C. paniculatus
extract has showed statistically signiﬁcant improvement in
memory process when compared to control. The estimation
of acetylcholinesterase enzyme in rat brain supports the
plus maze and passive avoidance test by reducing acetyl-
cholinesterase activity which helps in memory perfor-
mance. The study reveals that the aqueous extract of
C. paniculatus seed has dose-dependent cholinergic activ-
ity, thereby improving memory performance. The effect of
C. paniculatus to enhance cognition may be due to
increased acetylcholine level in rat brain [5].
Kumar and Gupta studied aqueous, methanolic, chlo-
roform,
petroleum
ether
extracts
seeds
C. paniculatus for their effect on cognitive functions in rats.
Male Wistar rats weighing 200e250 g each were used to
study effect on learning and memory through use of the
shuttle-box, step-through, step-down, and EPM paradigms.
Only the aqueous seed extract (200 mg/kg body wt. for
14 days) showed an improvement in learning and memory
in both the shuttle-box and step-through paradigms.
Therefore, further experiments were conducted using the
aqueous extract at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg body wt. doses
in different paradigms of cognition. All three doses of the
aqueous extract increased the number of avoidances in the
shuttle-box and step-through latency in the step-through
apparatus, but no signiﬁcant difference was observed be-
tween the doses tested. In the step-down apparatus, the 200-
and 300-mg/kg body wt. doses of aqueous extract showed a
signiﬁcant increase in step-down latency, whereas no sig-
niﬁcant difference was observed in the EPM paradigm
between drug-treated and vehicle-treated groups. Since the
behavioral impairments are associated with oxidative stress,
we investigated the effect of the aqueous extract on
oxidative stress parameters. Among the three doses tested,
only 200 and 300 mg/kg body wt. stimulated a signiﬁcant
decrease in the brain levels of malondialdehyde, with
simultaneous signiﬁcant increases in levels of glutathione
and catalase. The present ﬁndings indicate that the aqueous
extract of C. paniculatus seed has cognitive-enhancing
properties and an antioxidant effect might be involved [36].
Bhagya et al. analyzed the neuroprotective effects of
C. paniculatus oil on stress-associated cognitive dysfunc-
tions. Chronic stress was induced by subjecting rats to re-
strainers for 6 h a day for 21 days. C. paniculatus oil (400,
600 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.) after stress protocol once a day over the next 14 days.
Groups used in the present study: normal control, stress,
stress þ vehicle, stress þ CP oil at two different doses (400
and 600 mg/kg, i.p.). After the drug treatment, open ﬁeld
and EPM were used to analyze anxietylike behavior, and
partially baited radial arm maze (RAM) and T-maze were
used to evaluate spatial learning and memory capabilities.
Stressed rats showed enhanced anxietylike behavior in
EPM (P < .001) and impaired performance in RAM
(P < .001) and T-maze tasks (P < .001) compared to
normal animals. In contrast, C. paniculatus oil treatment to
these rats improved their performance in both RAM
(P < .001) and T-maze (P < .001). In addition, CP oil
(P < .001). The study suggested the potential beneﬁcial
effect of C. paniculatus on stress-induced cognitive dys-
functions [4].
Gattu et al. investigated the effects of the seed oil of
C. paniculatus on the 6-day performance of young adult
rats in a navigational memory taskdthe Morris water
maze.
(gavage)
C. paniculatus (50, 200, or 400 mg/kg) for 14 days
completely reversed the scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg)-induced
task performance deﬁcit. On the other hand, acute treatment
(single injection prior to scopolamine treatment) with
C. paniculatus (200 mg/kg) did not signiﬁcantly reverse the
scopolamine-induced impairment in maze performance.
Alone, C. paniculatus produced a slight, but signiﬁcant
improvement in maze performance on the ﬁrst day of
testing. Acute treatment or chronic 14-day treatment with
C. paniculatus resulted in no signiﬁcant alteration in
normal locomotor activity in an open ﬁeld. Moreover,
C. paniculatus did not alter the scopolamine-induced in-
creases in locomotor activity. Chronic treatment with
C. paniculatus did not alter brain acetylcholinesterase
levels and no signs of cholinergic overstimulation were
ever noted during or after treatment. Thus, the seed oil of
C. paniculatus, when administered chronically, selectively
reversed the impairment in spatial memory produced by
acute central muscarinic receptor blockade, supporting the
possibility that one or more constituents of the oil may offer
cognitive enhancing properties [21].

Clitoria ternatea Linn. (Aparajita)
Rai et al. studied the memory enhancing property of C.
ternatea (Linn) root extract. Neonatal rat pups (7 days old)
were intubated with either 50 mg/kg body weight or
100 mg/kg body weight of aqueous root extract of
C. ternatea for 30 days. These rats were then subjected to
open-ﬁeld, two-compartment passive avoidance, and spatial
learning (T-Maze) tests (i) immediately after the treatment
and (ii) 30 days after the treatment, along with age-matched
normal and saline control rats. Results showed no change in
open ﬁeld behavior, but showed improved retention and
spatial learning performance at both time points of behav-
ioral tests, indicating the memory enhancing property of
C. ternatea [49].
Rai et al. found that treatment with 100 mg/kg of
C. ternatea aqueous root extract (CTR) for 30 days in
neonatal and young adult age groups of rats signiﬁcantly
increased ACh content in their hippocampi as compared to
age-matched controls. Increase in ACh content in their
hippocampus may be the neurochemical basis for their
improved learning and memory [50].
Tatanalli and Cheeramkuzhy examined the effective-
ness of alcoholic extracts of aerial and root parts of
C. ternatea at 300 and 500 mg/kg doses orally in rats in
attenuating
electroshock-induced
amnesia.
Extracts
300 mg/kg dose produced signiﬁcant memory retention,
and the root parts were found to be more effective. The
inﬂuence on central cholinergic activity by estimating the
ACh content of the whole brain and acetylcholinesterase
activity at different regions of the rat brain, viz., cerebral
cortex, midbrain, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum were
studied to elicit the antiamnesic effects. The ﬁndings sug-
gest that C. ternatea extracts increase rat brain ACh content
and acetyl cholinesterase activity in a similar fashion to the
standard cerebro-protective drug pyritinol [70].
Raghu et al. studied the protective effects of C. ternatea
in Wistar rat model of various age groups upon stereotaxic-
mediated kainic acid-induced brain injury. The rodent ex-
periments were carried out in 1, 12 and 18-month-old male
Wistar rats. The rats were orally fed with C. ternatea (3 g
per kg body weight/day) for 60 days. Stereotaxic-mediated
kainate stress to the hippocampus was performed on day
61. The rats were sacriﬁced on 66th day and the brain
tissues were analyzed histologically and measured for
autophagy, base excision repair, and antioxidant enzyme
activities. In addition, cognitive functions were analyzed by
employing novel object recognition task and Morris water
maze tests. The gene expression proﬁle of hippocampus
was assessed by microarray hybridization and two genes
were validated. The results showed signiﬁcant decrease of
autophagy by C. ternatea in both 12 and 18-month-old rats.
The hippocampal CA3 cellularity were increased in
stereotaxic-mediated stressed rats by C. ternatea. There
were no signiﬁcant differences in constitutive base excision
repair and antioxidant enzyme activities. C. ternatea
treatment also signiﬁcantly increased episodic memory in
rats. Microarray experiments for pathway speciﬁc gene
expression analysis showed altered expression of genes of
long-term potentiation, axon guidance, neuroactive ligand-
receptor interaction, regulation of autophagy, lysosome,
homologous recombination, and nucleotide excision repair
pathways in adult rats by C. ternatea. The ﬁndings suggest
that C. ternatea protects the brain cells from stress-induced
injury [48].
Acorus calamus (Vacha)
Esfandiari et al. assessed the effect of A. calamus on
memory loss, anxiety, and antioxidant indices on neuro-
inﬂammation rat models. Different fractions of A. calamus
were prepared. The subject rats were grouped in 11 groups
of 10 each. In the 9 treated groups, the extract gavage began
1 week before intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) and continued for 2 weeks after the last
injection of LPS. Behavioral tests, including passive
avoidance and EPM tests, were run on days 24, 25, and 26
and the subjects were sacriﬁced on the day after the last
behavioral test, and their hippocampus was isolated to
measure the oxidative stress markers. Assessment of
oxidative stress markers in hippocampus samples revealed
that the amounts of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (su-
peroxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and total anti-
oxidant activity) in the groups that received different
fractions were less than their equivalent ﬁgures in LPS-
control group, and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in
treatment groups were less than MDA level in LPS-control
group. Moreover, the treatment groups with different
fractions of A. calamus revealed better performance
compared to LPS-control group in shuttle-box test. In EPM
test, the groups with different fractions revealed lower
stress level in comparison with LPS-control group. The best
performance in memory test and the lowest level of stress in
EPM was observed in the group with aqueous fraction at
600 mg/kg dose, and the least ﬁgures of oxidative stress
markers were of the group with aqueous fraction at 600 mg/
kg dose. The oral administration of different fractions of
A. calamus, especially aqueous fraction, prevented from
memory deﬁcits and stress through controlling oxidative
stress and inﬂammation processes [19].
Reddy et al. investigated the effect of A. calamus on
learning and memory in adult Wistar male rats. Animals

were subjected to restrained stress for 21 days (6 h/day) and
were concurrently administered A. calamus for 21 days
orally. The Hebb-Williams maze and EPM served as
standard behavioral models for testing memory. The rats
were sacriﬁced on 22nd day and the brain homogenate was
taken for various biochemical assessments. Sodium potas-
sium ATPase activity and TBARS levels showed a sig-
niﬁcant decrease in the stress group compared to control.
After administration of AC, the activity of Na- K-ATPase
and levels of TBARS showed a tendency to revert back
to normal. The study indicated the preventive action of
A. calamus rhizome powder on stress-induced cognitive
functions and modulatory effect on antioxidants and Na-K-
ATPase activity [52].
Mukherjee et al. evaluated the in vitro acetylcholinesterase
(AChE)inhibitorypotentialofthehydroalcoholicextractandof
the essential oil from A. calamus rhizomes and that of its major
constituents based on the Ellman’s method. GC/MS analysis of
the oil revealed that the major constituents were beta-asarone
(79.54%) and alpha-asarone (8.47%). The IC50 values were
obtained for the hydroalcoholic extract, the essential oil, beta-
asarone and alpha-asarone and were 182.31  16.78 mg/mL,
10.67  0.81 mg/mL, 3.33  0.02 mM and 46.38  2.69 mM,
respectively.Physostigminewasusedasstandardinhibitorwith
an IC50 value of 0.28  0.015 mM. The experimental
observations revealed that the AC essential oil and its constit-
uents have signiﬁcant AChE inhibitory potential. Beta-asarone,
the major phytoconstituent present in the essential oil, showed
the maximum inhibitory potential [42].

Polyherbal formulations and synergistic effects
Brain disorders are ubiquitous and functionally disabling
conditions which create signiﬁcant challenges both for
individuals and society. Effective therapeutic interventions
for many brain disorders, such as Alzheimer disease (AD),
are generally lacking. Although several categories of
pharmaceutical agents are currently available for the treat-
ment of these conditions, the clinical outcomes are often
limited to modest symptomatic relief and many of these
inventions are associated with potentially severe undesir-
able side effects. As such, other novel treatments that
provide efﬁcacious adjunctive or alternatives to existing
medications, with less adverse consequences from long-
term use, are desirable for patients with brain dysfunction.
Traditional medicine is a valuable source of medical
wisdom and knowledge and provides potentially viable
interventions and clues for ﬁnding novel phytopharma-
ceuticals. Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) has been
practiced in vast geographic areas including Persia and
India for over 12 centuries [1,2]. Combing the traditional
knowledge of ancient Iran and Greece, archaic civilizations
such as India and China, and through clinical observation
and practice over many centuries, TPM has evolved into a
holistic and comprehensive medical system with its own
scientiﬁc theories [3,4]. Herbal medicine, a key modality of
TPM that uses medicinal plants in simple and compound
formulations, has been used for the prevention and treat-
ment of various diseases including brain disorders.
This chapter will provide an overview of the scientiﬁc
evidence for the commonly recommended medicinal herbs
used for the management of brain disorders in TPM. It is
worth noting that a more holistic treatment/management
approach is used in TPM, as herbal therapy is often com-
bined with diet therapy and psychotherapy for the treatment
of brain disorders [5].
Herbal medicines for brain health
Herbal medicines, in the form of monotherapy or augmen-
tation therapy, have been used in TPM for thousands of
years to promote brain health and to treat various brain
disorders such as epilepsy, dementia, Parkinson’s disease
(PD), and migraines. In this chapter, a search of major
medical texts of TPM including Canon of Medicine (Avi-
cenna, 11th century), Al-Ḥâwi ﬁṬibb (Rhazes, 10th

conducted to identify the herbal medicines typically
recommended for brain health. Some of the most commonly
used and studied herbs include Brassica nigra, Cinnamo-
mum verum, Zingiber ofﬁcinale, Crocus sativus, and Piper
nigrum. Scientiﬁc and traditional names, plant parts, and
preparations used in TPM have been mentioned in
Table 8.1. Table 8.2 summarizes the key bioactive
components, pharmacological activity, and the mechanisms
of action of these herbs.
Individual herbs
Brassica nigra (L.) Koch
(Basionym: Sinapis nigra L.)
B. nigra seed (black mustard) has been used in therapeutic
preparations for centuries in different parts of the world and
is recommended in TPM for the treatment of various
neurological disorders [6e9]. B. nigra possesses cognitive-
enhancing, anti-Parkinson and antimigraine properties. Its
key constituents include glucosinolates, phenolic com-
pounds, ﬂavonoids, and brassinosteroids [10]. The neuro-
protective effects of B. nigra were revealed in a number of
studies.
intraperitoneal
hydro-
alcoholic extract of B. nigra seed (75, 150, and 300 mg/
kg) signiﬁcantly reduced the intensity and duration of sei-
zures in mice models of pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling
[11,12]. In another study, the anti-Parkinson effect of orally
administered B. nigra (400 mg/kg) was evaluated in
chlorpromazine induced catalepsy in rats, an accepted
Parkinson disease model. Catalepsy was measured using
the actophotometer method. Pretreatment with B. nigra
extract resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced cataleptic scores,
increased glutathione (GSH) level, and decreased thio-
barbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (an indicator
of lipid peroxidation extent) [13]. The methanol extract of
B. nigra exhibited considerable radical scavenging and
antioxidant activity [14]. B. nigra is also suggested to have
anti-inﬂammatory effects. The ethanol extract of its leaves
(500 mg/kg)
inhibited
inﬂammation
carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. It also inhibited
protease in a dose-response pattern [15]. The memory and
cognitive enhancing and anti-Parkinsonism effects of
B. nigra can be attributed to its high antioxidant and anti-
inﬂammatory properties; however, the exact mechanisms of
action underlying these effects are yet to be established.
Cinnamomum verum J.Presl
(Synonym: Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume)
In TPM, C. verum (bark) (cinnamon) is a brain tonic agent
and is used in some complex formulations for the treatment
of dementia [6,7]. Cinnamon contains a variety of phyto-
chemicals
as cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamyl
acetate,
eugenol, and cinnamyl alcohol, which may be responsible
several
anti-neuro-inﬂammatory and antioxidant effects [16]. More
recently, cinnamon has been suggested to possess anti-
Parkinson properties [17e19]. Animal studies suggest that
the anti-Parkinson beneﬁts of cinnamon are based on
enhancing sodium benzoate (NaB) levels in blood serum and
the brain. The increased level of NaB protects Parkin and
DJ-1 in astrocytes by suppressing the production of NO
and expression of iNOS, which are potentially toxic to
neurons [17].
Findings of animal studies also demonstrate the potential
ability of cinnamon to improve memory function [20].
Proposed mechanisms include inhibiting malondialdehyde
(MDA) production [21], radical scavenging [22], and
inhibiting the tau aggregation and ﬁlament formation asso-
ciated with AD [23]. In addition, cinnamon has been shown
to modulate endothelial functions and attenuate the vascular
cell adhesion molecules [23]. Considering the results of
preclinical studies on cinnamon, together with its safety
proﬁle, randomized controlled trials (RCTs)are warranted to
determine the effectiveness and safety of cinnamon in pa-
tients with Parkinson’s disease and/or dementia.
Crocus sativus L.
C. sativus (stigma) (saffron) is a well-known herb in
medieval Persia for its neuromodulatory properties; spe-
ciﬁcally, as an antidepressant [6,24]. The neuroprotective
and psychoactive properties of saffron and its major
bioactive components (including crocin, safranal, and cro-
cetin) have been demonstrated in numerous preclinical
studies [25,26]. The antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of
saffron were conﬁrmed by several human clinical trials
[27,28]. Some animal and human studies also indicate that
saffron and crocin could improve obsessive compulsive
disorder [29,30]. The neuropsychiatric effects of saffron
purportedly act by inhibiting the reuptake of some neuro-
transmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and sero-
tonin [31].
More recently, saffron has been suggested to possess
potential antidementia effects, conﬁrming its traditional
claims. Saffron
was shown to signiﬁcantly improve
learning and memory function in an animal model of
dementia [32]. A 1-year single-blind clinical study in
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) revealed a
signiﬁcant improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) scores with the daily administration of saffron
(125 mg/day) compared to control [33]. A RCT in AD
patients revealed that a 16-week treatment with saffron
signiﬁcantly improved Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment
Scale-cognitive
subscale
(ADAS-cog)
Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) compared
to placebo [34]. The results of a 22-week double-blind RCT

(cholinesterase inhibitor) (5 mg twice daily) in AD patients
demonstrated that both treatments signiﬁcantly improved
cognitive function (measured by ADAS-cog and CDR-SB),
but saffron appeared to possess a better safety proﬁle [35].
In a 1-year double-blind RCT in patients with moderate to
severe AD, saffron extract (30 mg daily) was compared
with memantine (NMDA receptor antagonist) (20 mg
daily). The results demonstrate that saffron signiﬁcantly
improved cognitive function and overall functional activity
comparable to that of memantine [36].
While the exact mechanisms underlying the anti-
dementia effect of saffron are still unclear, it is thought to
act through several pharmacological pathways. Saffron and
crocetin have been shown to possess anti-inﬂammatory
effects and also to exert strong protection in repressing
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreasing
caspase-3 activation [37,38]. Furthermore, some studies
reported that crocin, a main carotenoid component of
saffron, has inhibitory properties against A-beta ﬁbrillo-
genesis formation [39e41]. Additionally, the saffron
extract provides a moderate inhibitory activity (up to 30%)
on acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) and inhibits acetylcholine
breakdown, which is one of the main therapeutic targets for
AD. The main anti-AChE constituents of saffron are known
to be crocetin and dimethylcrocetin [42].
Lavandula stoechas L.
L. stoechas (aerial parts) (French lavender) is native to the
Mediterranean region and is one of the most studied herbs
[6,43]. French lavender is commonly combined with other
herbs in complex formulations for the treatment of cogni-
tive dysfunction and psychological disorders such as
anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) [44,45].
Recently, two of Lavandula species (L. stoechas and
L. angustifolia Mill.) have drawn increasing interest for a
number of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disor-
ders. Some experimental studies in rats showed that inhaled
lavender
scopolamine-induced
memory performance in different maze tasks, suggesting
the potential positive effect on memory function [46,47]. In
an in vivo study of beta-amyloid-induced AD model in rats,
administration of aqueous extract of lavender (200 mg/kg)
for 20 days signiﬁcantly enhanced the learning of the maze
task [48]. Lavender oil has been recommended for the
treatment of agitation in dementia. In a small (n ¼ 15)
placebo controlled clinical study in patients with severe
dementia, inhalation of 2% lavender oil showed partial
improvement in the majority of patients [49]. In a short-
term clinical study in healthy and young volunteers,
inhalation of lavender oil signiﬁcantly increased visual
memory, when compared to the control group [50].
The key bioactive components of lavender include
linalool, linalyl acetate, aromatic phenol, perillyl alcohol,
and 1,8-cineole. Some in vivo psychopharmacological
studies showed that linalool has considerable sedative
effects on the CNS, including hypnotic, hypothermic, and
anticonvulsant properties [51]. The modifying effect of
linalool on the glutamatergic system is comparable with
phenobarbital, a known anticonvulsant. Linalool has shown
to be able to bind to the glutamate receptors and therefore
antagonize
cyclic
adenosine
monophosphate
(cAMP)
regulatory mechanism [51,52]. Also, some in vitro studies
showed the potential antioxidant activity of phenol fraction
of lavender, remarking its concentration-dependent inhibi-
tion of lipid peroxidation [53].
Clinical studies demonstrate that lavender is potentially
beneﬁcial in some mood disorders such as depression and
anxiety. In an RCT, patients undergoing diagnostic curet-
tage were randomized to receive the inhalation of essential
oil of lavender or control. The results showed a signiﬁcant
reduction in anxiety in the lavender-treated group compared
to control [54]. In another clinical trial, oral administration
of lavender oil (once daily, 80 mg/day) reduced anxiety
levels; improved anxiety-associated symptoms such as
somatic complaints, restlessness, and disturbed sleep; and
increased general wellbeing. Lavender oil has the potential
to modulate GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmis-
sion. It was also found to increase dopaminergic activity by
enhancing dopamine receptors (subtype D3) [55].
Melissa ofﬁcinalis L.
M. ofﬁcinalis (aerial parts) (lemon balm) aerial parts are
commonly used by TPM physicians for the treatment of
several
central
nervous
dementia. Moreover, it is highly recommended for the
treatment of mood disorders such as anxiety, depression,
and OCD [8,56e58]. The neuroprotective effect of lemon
balm has been evaluated in a number of preclinical and
clinical studies. In an in vitro study, pretreatment with the
methanol extract of lemon balm revealed the signiﬁcant
neuroprotective effect in rat pheochromocytoma cells
(PC12)
hydrogen
peroxide
toxicity
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bro-
mide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays [59].
Lemon balm extracts contain phenolic compounds such as
phenolic acids and ﬂavonoids that are responsible for its
antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities [60,61].
Lemon balm has also been associated with memory
enhancing activities in different studies. Administration of
lemon balm extract (200 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly improved
memory and learning processes in naïve rats and amelio-
rated scopolamine-induced learning deﬁcits [62]. In a ran-
domized,
placebo-controlled,
crossover
study, 20 healthy and young participants (between 18 and

22 years) were randomly allocated to single doses of lemon
balm dried leaf (300, 600, and 900 mg) or placebo with a
washout interval of 7 days. The results demonstrated that
lemon balm could modulate cognitive performance and
mood in a dose-dependent manner [63]. In another double-
blind clinical trial, 35 patients with mild-to-moderate
AD were randomized to receive standardized (500 mg
citral/mL) lemon balm extract or placebo (60 drops/day).
After 16 weeks, the patients in the lemon balm group
demonstrated signiﬁcantly better cognitive performance
than the placebo group [64].
The therapeutic effects of lemon balm on neuropsy-
chiatric disorders have also been demonstrated in several
preclinical and clinical studies. Rosmarinic acid, oleanolic
acid, and ursolic acid, some of the known active constitu-
ents of lemon balm, have been shown to inhibit GABA
transaminase, which is an enzyme responsible for GABA
degradation
[65].
Moreover,
lemon
balm
demonstrated to elevate GABA levels and inhibit MAO in
mice. In an experimental study in mice, lemon balm extract
(50 or 200 mg/kg) was shown to reduce corticosterone

investigations, a double-blind RCT in 100 young females
reported that a 3-month treatment with lemon balm extract
(1200 mg per day, from the ﬁrst day to the last day of
menstrual cycle) signiﬁcantly reduced stress and intensity
associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) [67]. A pilot
trial on stressed participants with mild-to-moderate anxiety
disorders and sleep disturbances showed a signiﬁcant
(15%e42%) reduction in insomnia and anxiety symptoms
with Cyracos (lemon balm standardized extract) (600 mg
per day) over 15 days [68].
Phyllanthus emblica L.
The fruit of P. emblica (emblic) is one of the most
recommended drugs in TPM for brain health especially for
improving memory and cognition. It contains a wide range
of phytochemicals including alkaloids, ﬂavonoids, tannins,
and terpenoids. P. emblica has shown to enhance memory
function in various animal models, as well as in some
clinical studies. In an in vivo study in young and aged rats,
oral administration of P. emblica (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg)
demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements in memory scores
over 15 days in a dose-response manner and reversed
scopolamine and diazepam-induced amnesia [69]. Pre-
treatment with P. emblica hydroalcoholic extract (500 and
700 mg/kg) was studied in kainic acid-induced seizures in
rats. The treatment signiﬁcantly increased the latency of
seizure compared with vehicle, prevented oxidative stress
parameter, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)
and ameliorated the fall in glutathione (GSH). It also
improved the cognitive deﬁcit caused by kainic acid, sug-
gesting a relationship between antioxidant activity and the
memory enhancing property of P. emblica [70]. The
aqueous extract of the fruit showed a signiﬁcant antioxidant
property through reducing lipid peroxidation [71]. Ethyl
acetate extract of P. emblica showed a signiﬁcant NO
radical scavenging in an in vitro study [72]. The antioxidant
activity of P. emblica is suggested to be due to its high
content of ascorbic acid, total tannins, and total phenols
[73,74].
A number of studies demonstrated that the anti-
inﬂammatory activity of P. emblica may be related to its
neuroprotective properties. In rats, oral administration of
water
emblica
doses
signiﬁcantly inhibited carrageenan-induced paw edema in a
dose-dependent manner [75]. It has also been demonstrated

scopolamine-induced amnesia, intraperitoneal administra-
tion of hydro-alcoholic extract of P. emblica (300, 450, and
600 mg/kg) reversed the rise of brain acetyl cholinesterase
(AchE) level and improved memory dysfunction induced
by scopolamine [77]. Moreover, oral administration of
various doses of tannoid principles of P. emblica showed
cognitive improvement and alleviated amyloid pathologies
against aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced model of AD in
rats. This activity is suggested to be related to the chelating
properties of emblicanin A and emblicanin B [78].
Piper nigrum L.
P. nigrum (fruit) (black pepper) is among the most popular
spices in the world and is suggested for the treatment of
various central nervous system disorders, usually in com-
bined formulations. It contains a variety of phytochemicals
such as ﬂavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, amides, and
steroids. The main alkaloid of P. nigrum, piperine [79]
possesses different neuropharmacological actions including
free radical scavenging, anti-neuro-inﬂammatory, anticho-
linergic, and MAO inhibitor effects, and is suggested as one
of the future plant-based pharmaceutical medicines for the
treatment of PD [80]. Piperine in different doses signiﬁ-
cantly improved spatial memory and neurodegeneration in
a rat model of AD [81]. It was also found to have
antidepressant-like activity in a corticosterone-induced
depression model in mice [82]. Furthermore, oral admin-
istration of the methanol extract of P. nigrum fruits (50 and
100 mg/kg)
ameliorated
beta-induced
memory impairment in a rat model of AD [83]. Another
study in a rat model of AD showed that P. nigrum could
prevent neurodegeneration and alleviate the neuropsycho-
logical symptoms, which are associated with AD [84].
Owing
anti-inﬂammatory,
antioxidant,
anti-
cholinesterase activities, P. nigrum has been suggested to
be a useful herb for the treatment of several neurodegen-
erative disorders [79,85].

Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merrill & Perry
(Synonym: Eugenia caryophyllata Thunb.)
S. aromaticum (ﬂower buds) (clove) is well-known for its
neuroprotective effects both in monotherapy and combi-
nation therapy [6,7,24]. Findings of animal studies suggest
that S. aromaticum, and its bioactive constituent eugenol,
may beneﬁt several neurological disorders. In mice, intra-
peritoneal administration of different clove oil doses
reversed
scopolamine-induced
impairment [86]. In another study, the dichloromethane
extract of clove showed AChE inhibitory activity [87],
which may be responsible for its cognitive-enhancing
effects. Eugenol, the chief constituent of clove oil has
shown antinociceptive activity in several pain models via
opioid and alpha adrenergic receptors [88]. Eugenol has
also been reported to have anticonvulsant activity [89]. In
an experimental study, eugenol (100e300 mM) signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the oxidative neural injury [90]. The neu-
roprotective effects of eugenol can be attributed to a
number of mechanisms. It has been shown to act as a
prooxidant and antioxidant, which leads to free radical
scavenging. It also exhibits anti-inﬂammatory properties by
inhibiting the release of tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin
1-b and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) stimulated macrophages [91]. The principal mecha-
nism responsible for the antiepileptic activity of eugenol
might be its ability to modulate synaptic transmissions [92].
Terminallia chebula Retz
T. chebula (fruit) (myrobalan) is one of the most popular
Persian herbs used to improve memory function. The fruit
of T. chebula contains antioxidant ingredients, including
ascorbic acid and quercetin, which are effective against
oxidative stresseinduced neurodegeneration [93]. It also
contains high content of tannins (32%e45%) including
chebulic acid, chebulinic acid, punicalagin, gallic acid,
ellagic acid, and tannic acid. T. chebula is suggested to
have neuroprotective activities including anticonvulsant
and antidementia properties. One in vivo study was con-
ducted to evaluate the effect of T. chebula on seizures and
seizure-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Hydro-
alcoholic extract of T. chebula (1000 mg/kg) showed
83.33% protection in maximal-electroshock (MES) and
66.66% protection in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced
seizures.
attenuated
seizure-induced
impairment [94]. Oral administration of T. chebula seed
extract (100 mg/day) provided signiﬁcant neuroprotection
against ischemic damage in the hippocampus of gerbils
over 7 days. In addition, the level of the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was reported to be much
higher in T. chebula-treated ischemia group than the
vehicle-treated control group. In mice, a 14-day oral
administration of T. chebula hydroalcoholic extract (100
200 mg/kg)
reversed
scopolamine-
induced amnesia [95]. T. chebula is reported by various
studies to have antioxidant activities [96]. Chebulic acid,
one of the major constituents of the fruit, is suggested as a
considerable antioxidant exhibiting free radical scavenging
and ferric-reducing activities in DPPH and ferric-reducing
antioxidant power (FRAP) studies [97]. T. chebula is also
known to exert anti-inﬂammatory effects in in vitro and
in vivo studies. In a study in a model of carrageenan-
paw
edema
rats,
T. chebula extract (250 mg/kg) caused a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in edema (69.96%). Gallotanins of T. chebula showed
anti-inﬂammatory effects by inhibiting protein expression
of iNOS and COX-2 in macrophage cells [98]. Further-
more, T. chebula is suggested to have AChE inhibitory
activity [99,100]. In an in vitro study, methanol extract of
the fruit of T. chebula (5 mg/mL) signiﬁcantly inhibited
AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by 89% and 95%,
respectively. Moreover, Gallotannins and tannic acid, two
of the T. chebula components, showed inhibitory activity
against AChE in some in vitro studies [101].
Zingiber ofﬁcinale Roscoe
Z. ofﬁcinale (rhizome) (ginger) has been used for the man-
agement of AD in many Asian countries. The principal
bioactive components in ginger include gingerols, shogaols,
and volatile oils such as zingiberene, bisabolene, and
monoterpenes [16,102]. Data from various animal and
clinical studies suggest that ginger possesses neuroprotective
properties [103]. In an amyloid-induced AD model in rats,
ginger root extract was administered intragastrically to the
animals for 35 days. The results revealed that ginger (4 g per
day) signiﬁcantly improved spatial memory and behavioral
dysfunction. It also increased the number of neurons as well
as intracellular Nissl bodies in the hippocampus [104]. The
results of another study in rats showed a signiﬁcant effect of
ginger (108 and 216 mg/kg per day) in reversing the
amnesia caused by AlCl3. The animals that received ginger
treatments exhibited improvements in behavior, T-Maze and
Rotarod tests [105]. In a randomized placebo-controlled
clinical trial, 60 healthy middle-aged women were ran-
domized to receive either ginger extracts 400 or 800 mg
daily or placebo over a 2-month period. The efﬁcacy of
ginger on working memory and cognitive function was
evaluated using recordings of the brain’s electrical activity
(event-related potentials) during computerized test batteries
and an auditory oddball paradigm. The results showed that
ginger-treated participants had larger N100 and P300 am-
plitudes, and decreased
P300 latencies,
reﬂecting an
improvement in attention and cognitive processes in
compared to those that received placebos. The ginger
treatment group also exhibited enhanced memory [106].

Ginger is also recommended to improve other neuro-
degenerative disorders such as Huntington’s disease [107]
and PD [108]. Neuroprotective properties of ginger can be
attributed to its several pharmacological properties such as
cholinesterase inhibition; anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidant,
and antiamyloidogenic activities. The AChE inhibitory
activity of ginger has been evaluated in an in vitro study in
rat brain. The results showed that ginger extract inhibits the
AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner [109]. Some
animal studies also showed that ginger produced an
inhibitory
cholinesterase
[105],
leading
acetylcholine accumulation in synapses and improved
cognitive function [16]. The anti-inﬂammatory effects of
ginger are also veriﬁed in a number of in vitro and in vivo
studies. Ginger inhibits the activity of NK-kB, iNOS, and
COX-2 [110]. Some animal models of dementia demon-
strate that 6-Shogaol, a bioactive constituent of ginger,
attenuated neuroinﬂammation and cognitive impairment by
enhancing the production and release of nerve growth
factor (NGF), which has a critical function in accelerating
neurite outgrowth and improving cognitive performance
[111]. The bioactive constituent of ginger 6-Shogaol and
three other shogaols from ginger were also found to protect
neural cells from b-amyloid (bA) attacks [112]. Further-
more, 6-Shogaol is reported to have the potential to
modulate dopaminergic neuron activities [108]. Ginger is
shown to be endowed with potent antioxidant properties in
in vitro and in vivo studies [113]. It has a strong effect in
scavenging DPPH radicals and controlling the peroxidation
of lipids with its high antioxidant activity [114,115].
Ginger is considered as a safe herbal medicine and has
no known acute toxicity at the usual doses consumed for
dietary or medicinal purposes [113]. More research is
needed to further evaluate the effectiveness and mecha-
nisms of ginger for the treatment of AD.
Polyherbal formulations and synergistic
Although single herbs are used for the treatment of various
disorders in TPM, many polyherbal formulations are also
prescribed based on the belief that these combinations may
produce synergistic effects, leading to better clinical out-
comes. Iṭriphal Ustakhuddus, Jawarish Jalinus, Ma’joon
Falasafah, Majoon Baladur, Jawarish Nisyan are among
the most important and complex formulations in TPM for
brain disorders. Ma’joon Falasafah (Paste for philoso-
phers) is one formula thought to enhance memory function,
contains
ingredients
Z.
ofﬁcinale,
T. chebula, P. emblica, C. zeylanicum, and C. longa. A
number of studies were conducted to evaluate the neuro-
protective effects of TMP polyherbal formulations. In a 12-
week RCT, a TPM polyherbal formula, commonly known
as “Davaie Loban” including ginger, black pepper, sweet
sedge, and incense [117], was evaluated for its efﬁcacy for
mild-to-moderate AD. Forty-four patients were randomized
to receive Davaie Loban capsules (500 mg, three times
daily) or placebo for 3 months. ADAS-cog and CDR-SB
were used to evaluate cognitive function. The results
showed a signiﬁcant improvement in ADAS-cog and CDR-
SB in participants who received Davaie Loban compared to
the control group. It is suggested that this formula improves
cognitive performance via antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory,
and cholinesterase inhibition [118].
TPM is a unique ancient medical system [119] with more
than 1000 years of history [5]. Early evidence from pre-
clinical and clinical studies demonstrates that several
medicinal herbs used in TPM practice could produce
therapeutic beneﬁts for various brain disorders. Some
bioactive components of the herbs may also serve as
potential leads for pharmaceutical drug development as
novel neuroprotective agents. Inhibition of brain AChE,
antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory activities are among the
most important mechanisms of actions underlying the
pharmacological effects of these herbs. However, more
research is needed to further evaluate the clinical effec-
tiveness of these herbs in the treatment of brain disorders
and their mechanisms of action.

Aging is a highly complex biological process whose pro-
gression
generally
time-dependent
accumulation of cellular damages [46,111] and character-
ized by inﬂammatory mechanisms leading to an organism
becoming more susceptible to infections and diseases.
Various phenomena contribute to the aging process, one of
which is the oxidative stress during normal metabolism.
The highly reactive byproducts generated during meta-
bolism, such as ROS and to a lesser extent reactive nitrogen
species, have the capacity to rapidly oxidize, and thus
damage, many classes of molecules such as proteins, lipids,
carbohydrates, and DNA [67]. The accumulated damage to
the biological macromolecules by the ROS greatly con-
tributes to the age-related changes at the cellular level.
The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress
due to its high aerobic metabolic rate, abundance of redox
modiﬁable substrates like iron and polyunsaturated fatty
acids, relatively low antioxidant capacity, and limited cell
turnover and neuroplasticity. Oxidative stress is an under-
lying risk factor for the pathogenesis of many neurode-
generative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
Parkinson’s disease (PD), and stroke. The age-related
decline in the neurophysiological functions of the brain
includes motor coordination and activity, memory, cogni-
tive ﬂexibility, and problem-solving ability [107]. Oxida-
tive damage in the aging brain varies in different regions of
the brain and the redox state of glutathione (GSH:GSSG;
reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione) acts as a sensi-
tive indicator of cellular oxidative stress [119]. Protein
oxidative damage in the cerebral cortex and in the cere-
bellum of old mice vary directly with the severity of their
cognitive (water maze acquisition) and motor (bridge
walking) impairments, respectively [33]. At high concen-
trations, ROS are detrimental and challenge the integrity of
DNA which may cause cellular dysfunction and cell death.
Innovative treatment strategies in combating age-related
neurodegenerative diseases involve the usage of anti-
oxidative and antiinﬂammatory effects of natural com-
pounds, which can prevent the deleterious effects triggered
by oxidative stress. Studies have shown that synthetic drugs
used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
ameliorate symptoms but do not alter the course of disease
progression and have even shown some undesired effects
[83]. Hence, the use of natural dietary compounds with
therapeutic potential (nutraceuticals), which are generally
safe and well-tolerated, has gained prominence in the
treatment of such diseases.

Brain aging and associated
neurodegenerative diseases
During aging, several alterations develop in the brain such
as changes in morphology, anatomy, vasculature, and
cognition. There is neuronal loss; decrease in dendritic
arborization; and reduction in the number, length, and
density of synaptic spines and myelinated axons, which
lead to enlarged cerebral ventricles, diminished cortical
lining, shrinking gray matter in the frontal and temporal
cortical areas, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and
thalamus. These dendritic spines play a role in the for-
mation and retention of memory. They are important for
speciﬁc neural connections and their turnover is crucial for
synaptic plasticity [34]. The plasticity of the neural system
is believed to have an impact on cognitive functions. The
medial temporal lobe and prefrontal lobe, which are
regions in the brain responsible for tasks such as learning,
memory, and executive function, particularly, showed an
age-dependent decline [14]. Brain aging may be regulated
at various levels; these can be at cellular, genetic,
biochemical,
transmission,
interactions.
Reduced levels of dopamine, glutamine, and serotonin
due to loss of dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and seroto-
nergic neurons are implicated in neuronal plasticity. Low
levels of estrogen, progesterone, thyroxine, and melatonin
and increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol are
implicated in impaired brain functions. High level of in-
sulin and the stress hormone, cortisol, are associated with
brain aging diseases. High lactate level in the brain due to a
shift in the lactate dehydrogenase is now considered one of
the hallmarks of brain aging [100]. Upregulation of genes
related to inﬂammation and DNA repair and repression of
mitochondrial genes are observed during aging. Epigenetic
changes in neuronal plasticity genes such as early growth
response 1 (EGR1) and BDNF in the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex are associated with age-related cognitive
deﬁcits [93]. The insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is
responsible for neuronal maturation, survival, and adult
neurogenesis. Hence, it plays an important role in brain
development and diminishing levels of IGF-1 would
contribute to brain aging [44]. Studies have indicated that
ROS levels increase with age, and oxidation of lipids,
proteins, and DNA is considered to be the hallmark of brain
aging [24].
Brain aging is accompanied by a decline in cognitive
functions such as learning ability and motor loss memory
with high susceptibility to developing brain disorders,
namely PD, AD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
(Fig. 9.1). AD is a progressive and neurodegenerative
disorder of the cortex and hippocampus, which eventually
leads
presence
neuroﬁbrillary tangles and Ab plaques in these brain re-
gions are hallmarks of AD. Therefore, the inhibition of Ab
peptide aggregation has been considered the primary ther-
apeutic strategy for AD treatment. PD is a chronic and
progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with
impairment of motor function including increased muscle
rigidity, resting tremors, bradykinesia, and in extreme
cases, a nearly complete loss of movement. These symp-
toms are associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra which may be caused due to
damage,
proteasomal
inﬂammatory
changes.
Age-related
neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD which
have risen steadily in most countries worldwide have
detrimental effects on families and may strain the economy
and healthcare systems. Though a cure for the neurode-
generative diseases has not been found, natural remediation
through the use of polyphenols and ﬂavonoids found
mainly in plants and microorganisms has emerged as a
potential therapeutic strategy that may help treating both
cognitive and behavioral symptoms of the disease, as well
as prevention. We have summarily reviewed the work done
on some of the beneﬁcial effects of nutraceuticals during
brain aging and age-related diseases:
Curcumin in healthy brain aging
Curcumin is a widely studied nutraceutical, belonging to
polyphenols, acquired from the rhizome of a plant Cur-
cuma longa (turmeric), a member of the ginger family. It
contains 12 active components and the percentage of cur-
cumin (chemically known as diferuloylmethane) is less
than 3.14% per dry weight of turmeric powder. Clinical
studies suggest that curcumin could be effective in
decreasing
damage
[71],
reversing
degeneration resulting from Ab production [143], pre-
venting b-amyloid protein formation [116], decreasing
beta-amyloid plaques [91], inhibiting Ab aggregation, and
blocking cholesterol formation [23]). A clinical study on
AD mice showed that the animals which were fed low
doses of curcumin had a 40% reduction in the level of beta-
amyloid compared to those that were not fed curcumin
[116]. Curcumin possesses the ability to prevent neuronal
damage in the brain by impeding the formation of the
amyloid-beta plaques, thus reducing the number of plaques
in the brain [2]. Administration of 80 mg/day of lipidated
curcumin to healthy subjects [55] showed that the level of
Ab1e40 in plasma was signiﬁcantly reduced. Curcumin has
a high binding afﬁnity for iron and copper, thereby acting
as an iron chelator in AD [54].
Curcumin increases cAMP response element binding
protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) levels and thereby regulates D-galactose-induced

learning and spatial memory impairment in an aged mouse
model [89]. Curcumin treatment restores BDNF and ERK1/
2 levels in the hippocampus of chronic stresseinduced
cognitive deﬁcits in rats [72]. In the Ab(1e42)-induced
cognitive impairment in rats, nanoencapsulated curcumin
restores BDNF levels and the AKT/GSK-3b signaling
pathway in astrocytes and microglial cells. Consequently,
tau hyperphosphorylation is modulated along with an in-
crease in hippocampal synaptophysin levels [47]. The ag-
gregation of a-synuclein in the brain has been implicated as
a crucial step in the formation of Lewy bodies, a charac-
teristic of PD. Curcumin has antiﬁbrillogenic and ﬁbril-
destabilizing properties and inhibits the formation of
a-synuclein ﬁbrils [36,91]. Tetrahydrocurcumin has been
reported to regulate O-type forkhead domain transcription
factor (FOXO) and reduce the oxidative stress, leading to
the lifespan extension of Drosophila [140].
In a randomized placebo controlled, double-blinded
study, curcumin showed neuroprotective effects in AD
patients through various mechanisms, including the inhib-
itory action on Ab aggregation, the inﬂammatory pathways,
and free radicaleinduced neurodegeneration [8]. It pos-
sesses antiamyloidogenic potential, through its inhibition
on Ab aggregation and downregulation of BACE1 (beta-
amyloid cleaving enzyme 1) expression. It plays a key
role in tau tangle clearance by inhibiting tau hyper-
phosphorylation. In the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
AD model, curcumin was found to have free radicals-
scavenging, antiamyloid, and antiinﬂammatory effects.
Inhibition of inﬂammatory cytokines and reduction of Ab
load by curcumin therapy [10] enhances its use as a neu-
roprotective agent that promotes neuroplasticity. A dose-
response meta-analysis of clinical studies consisting of
randomized control trials of curcumin supplementation on
serum BDNF in adult men and women indicates the po-
tential use of curcumin in the treatment of neurological
disorders associated with low BDNF levels [104]. Curcu-
min has also been shown to inhibit AChE activity [108] and
reduce astrocytic marker glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) level [71].
Gingerol in healthy brain aging
Ginger (Z. ofﬁcinale) is considered a traditional herb used
in Asian countries. Due to its bioactive constituents, ginger
has shown various types of therapeutic effects, including
antibacterial, anticancer, antiinﬂammatory, antioxidative,
and neuroprotective activities. It possesses two active
compounds, gingerol and shogaol, which protect against
oxidative stress and inﬂammation in the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Ginger has been
reported to display a protective role in diabetic human brain
by reducing oxidative stress and inﬂammation. Ginger also
reduces
AChE
expression,
modulates
astroglial
response to injury, and improves neurogenesis. The
neuroprotective property of ginger was revealed by the
decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) level and the accel-
eration of the brain oxidant defense mechanism [63].
FIGURE 9.1
Correlation between oxidative stress, neuroinﬂammation, brain aging, and related diseases. Oxidative stress is caused due to an
imbalance between the reactive oxygen species generated and the antioxidants available, leading to the neuroinﬂammation in the aging brain. Conse-
quently, various pathophysiological conditions and diseases arise such as Alzheimer’s disease (Ab aggregation and neuroﬁbrillary tangles), Parkinson’s
disease (Lewy bodies and loss of dopaminergic neurons), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72 mutation and TDP-43 protein aggregation).

scopolamine-induced memory loss, upregulated the level of
BDNF, which is essential to neuronal maintenance and
survival, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive processes. In
human studies, ginger has been shown to affect the
cognitive function of elderly people [102]. The active
compounds in ginger inhibit the cholinesterase activity,
resulting in an increased level of acetylcholine that is
essential for learning and memory processing [41]. The
administration of the ginger extract at doses of 100 and
200 mg/kg improves cognitive function and neuronal den-
sity in the hippocampal regions of rats [136]. Furthermore,
the infarct volume of rats was decreased demonstrating that
the antioxidant activity of ginger can enhance cognitive
function and exerts neuroprotective effects in rats.
Gingerol possesses free radical scavenging activity,
inhibits butyrylcholinesterase and increased cell survival
against b-amyloid, which can induce toxicity in neuronal
cells [127]. Gingerol effectively suppresses the expression
of b-amyloid, which is induced by the accumulation of
ROS and nitrogen species, increases the expression of
antioxidant enzymes, and restores glutathione levels [69].
Using a rat model of AD, gingerol has been shown to
improve learning and memory and reduce oxidative stress
and inﬂammation demonstrating that a high dose of ginger
extract increased the number of Nissl bodies and neurons,
increased the activation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
catalase (CAT), and decreased the levels of MDA, NF-kB,
and IL-1 [147]. Ginger may reduce cognitive dysfunction
in PD by inhibiting the inﬂammatory responses, increasing
the nerve growth factor level, and improving the formation
of synapses in the brain of a PD mouse model [85].The
compound 6-shogaol has been reported to protect dopa-
minergic neurons against MPTP- and MPPþ-induced
neurotoxicity in an in vitro and in vivo PD model sug-
gesting the protection of dopaminergic neurons through the
inhibition of the inﬂammatory pathway, including TNF-a,
NO, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in
the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the stratum [43].
Gingko biloba in healthy brain aging
The leaves of the G. biloba (maidenhair tree) are known to
possess medicinal properties. EGb761 (Tanakan) is a
standardized extract of G. biloba leaves that has protective
properties against neuronal and vascular damage [76]. The
extract of G. biloba leaves (EGb761) contains 24% ﬂavo-
noid glycosides (containing quercetin, kaempferol, iso-
rhamnetin, etc.), 6% terpenoids (3.1% ginkgolides A, B, C,
and J and 2.9% bilobalide), and 5%e10% organic acids.
The ﬂavonoids and terpenoids are suggested to be the
pharmacologically active constituents of EGb761 [118].
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that
EGb761
radical
scavenging
agent
[118].
Pretreatment of cerebellar granule cells with EGb761
effectively attenuated oxidative damage triggered by H2O2/
FeSO4 [137]. In the Ab-expressing neuroblastoma cell line
N2a, an AD model, EGb761 attenuated the basal as well as
the induced levels of H2O2-related ROS [139]. EGb761
also stabilizes the cellular redox state by upregulating the
activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dis-
mutase and catalase in rat hippocampus and ileum [12].
EGb761 leads to the enhancement of the activity of gluta-
thione reductase and gamma-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase,
which are critical for reduction and synthesis of GSH [105].
The polyphenol structure of ﬂavonoids is responsible
for antioxidant actions of EGb761 through direct scav-
enging of ROS, chelating pro-oxidant transition metal ions,
and increasing antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GSH.
EGb761 prevented amyloid-b peptide (Ab)-induced mito-
chondrial dysfunction in the SH-SY5Y cells and thus
reduced intracellular ROS generation [115]. In the PC12
cells isolated mitochondria, EGb761, and bilobalide upre-
gulated the gene expression of mitochondrial NADH de-
hydrogenase and decreased stage 4 respiration, whose
increase otherwise indicates increased oxidative damage in
mitochondria [125].
Using two animal models of aging, the senescence
accelerated prone 8 mouse strain (SAMP8) and ovariecto-
mized rats, EGb761 treatment effectively prevented the
decrease of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity, mito-
chondrial ATP content, and mitochondrial GSH content in
hippocampi of aged SAMP8. EGb761 has been demon-
strated to have antiinﬂammatory effects, which are attrib-
uted to the combined actions of its ginkgolide and
ﬂavonoid constituents [16]. Increased concentrations of
platelet activating factor (PAF) in the brain are also
implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [7].
Ginkgolides have potent antagonist effects against PAF
[16], a regulator of cytokines in inﬂammatory responses
[76]. In addition to PAF-antagonizing activity, the inhibi-
tory effects of ginkgolides A and B on proinﬂammatory
cytokines:
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha
(TNF-a)
interleukin-1
(IL-1)
lipopolysaccharide-
stimulated rat microglial cultures were also observed [28].
EGb761 protects against Ab-induced neurotoxicity by
blockage of Ab-induced events, such as ROS accumula-
tion, glucose uptake, mitochondrial dysfunction, activation
of AKT, JNK, and ERK 1/2 pathways and apoptosis [118].
In addition to the protective effects against Ab, EGb761 has
also been shown to prevent amyloidogenesis. EGb761 di-
rects amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism toward
the a-secretase pathway, thereby increasing the release of
the soluble form of APP (sAPPa). Using the transgenic AD
model Tg2576 mice, after EGb761treatment, Tg2576 mice
exhibited an enhancement of spatial learning and memory
comparable to wildtype mice suggesting that EGb761 in-
hibits the production of brain Ab by lowering the levels of

circulating free cholesterol, as free circulating and intra-
cellular cholesterol levels could affect APP processing and
amyloidogenesis [48]. Through its iron chelating property,
EGb761 may inhibit the aggregation of Ab formation by
inhibiting the interaction of Ab with transition metal ions.
The inhibitory effect of EGb761on Ab aggregation was
also observed with bilobalide, ginkgolide J, and ﬂavonoid
compounds [74].
Ginseng in healthy brain aging
Ginseng (Order: Apiales, Family: Araliaceae, Genus:
Panax) has been used in traditional Asian medicine. The
bioactive ingredients in ginseng root include more than 60
ginsenosides, e.g., Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Re, Rg1, Rg2,
and Rg3, as well as polysaccharides, fatty acids, oligo-
peptides, and polyacetylenic alcohols. Ginseng active in-
gredients, Ginsenosides Rg1 (GRg1) and Rb1 (GRb1),
have a great potential in the prevention and treatment of
brain disorders. Rb1 and baicalin promote proliferation and
differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells in AD rat
models. It increases the expression of nestin, GFAP, and
neuron speciﬁc-enolase (NSE) leading to a decreased nu-
clear pyknosis and pyramidal cell defects in hippocampus
and thereby improves cognitive function in AD rats [152].
Ginsenoside, Rg1 downregulates protease activated recep-
tor 1 (PAR-1) expression [141] and protects blood-brain
barrier disruption in a brain injury model leading to
amelioration of cerebral ischemia [155].
Ginsenoside Rg1 supplementation improved the per-
formance of aged mice in behavioral tests and signiﬁcantly
upregulated
plasticitye
associated proteins in the hippocampus, including syn-
aptophysin,
NMDAR
(N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor)
subunit 1, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and
CaMKII alpha via the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway [145]. Ginsenosides have been shown in
many studies to inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS). Rg3 at 20 and 30 mg/kg oral doses modulated an
increase in TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 mRNA after lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS) injection in mice [92].Under physi-
ological conditions, Keap1 keeps the Nrf2 transcription
factor in the cytoplasm, allowing it to be ubiquitinated and
degraded by proteasomes, but in AD, free Nrf2 translocates
into the nucleus. Elevation of Nrf2 after relocating to the
nucleus accelerates antioxidant enzyme expression such as
NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme
oxygenase-1 (HO-1) indicating the important role of
the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in neuroprotective effects of
ginseng [129].
ginsenosides
8 months modulated age-related memory impairment in
mice [152]. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) reduced
brain APP mRNA levels and improved learning and
memory in senescence accelerated mice. Ginsenosides CK,
F1, Rh1, and Rh2 from Panax ginseng have BACE1
inhibitory
activities
[59];
PNS
increase
non-
amyloidogenic processing of APP by increasing a-secre-
tase activity, and decreased amyloidogenic processing by
decreasing BACE1 expression [50]. Ginseng may also have
beneﬁcial
reducing
tau
hyper-
phosphorylation and neuroﬁbrillary tangle formation. Gin-
senoside extracts from P. ginseng enhance the phosphatase
activity of puriﬁed calcineurin, the inhibition of which
leads to tau hyperphosphorylation in AD brains [126].
Ginsenoside Rg1 (20 mg/kg) reversed memory impair-
ments induced by okadaic acid by decreasing levels of
phosphorylated tau and suppressing the formation of Ab in
the brain of rats [120] suggesting the neuroprotective effect
of ginsenosides by reducing tau hyperphosphorylation.
Ginsenoside Rg5 found in P. ginseng reduces acetylcho-
linesterase (AChE) activity while choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) activity was increased in the cortex of Rg5 treated
rats [18]. Ginsenoside Rg1 is a potential regulator of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), and could act via
this transcription factor to improve cell survival, angio-
genesis, and neurogenesis [124].
Ginsenosides that act as neuroprotective agents for PD
are Rb1, Rg1, Rd, and Re. These compounds exert neu-
roprotective effects through inhibition of oxidative stress
neuroinﬂammation,
decrease
toxin-induced
apoptosis and nigral iron levels, and regulation of N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel activity [42]. Oral
administration of the ginseng extract, G115, modulates
tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell loss in the substantia
nigra, and reduces locomotor dysfunction in the 1-methyl-
4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-
4-phenylpyridinium (MPPþ) models of PD [128].
Quercetin in healthy brain aging
Quercetin (3,5,7,30,40-pentahydroxyﬂavone), a ﬂavonoid
generally found in fruits and vegetables, such as onions and
apples, and red wine, has potential nutraceutical uses.
Several studies show that quercetin can exert neuro-
protection and antagonize oxidative stress when adminis-
tered in vivo. Oral administration of quercetin was shown
to protect rodents from oxidative stress and neurotoxicity
induced by various neurotoxic insults [53]. Quercetin also
antagonized cognitive impairment induced by feeding mice
a high-fat diet. Quercetin has been reported to ameliorate
AD pathology and related cognitive deﬁcits in an aged
triple transgenic AD mouse model [101]. Furthermore,
using a PD animal model, a combined oral supplementation
of quercetin and ﬁsh oil enhances neuroprotection in rats
exposed to 3-nitropropionic acid [22]. Activation of the
Nrf2-ARE
provides
neuroprotection
oxidative damage and cell death. Nrf2-ARE pathway is

involved in the formation and degradation of misfolded
protein aggregates in various neurodegenerative diseases
such as PD, AD, and Huntington’s disease (HD) [38].
Other nutraceuticals (e.g., kaempferol, pterostilbene) have
been shown to interact synergistically with quercetin in a
similar manner.
Neuroinﬂammation plays a relevant role in neuro-
developmental and neurodegenerative disorders and thus
represents a potential important target for therapeutic in-
terventions [9]. Quercetin has been shown to reduce lipo-
polysaccharide-(LPS)-induced nitric oxide release from a
mouse neuroglia cell line [17]; a similar effect on LPS-
another mouse microglial cell line [13]. In addition, quer-
cetin also inhibits cytokine production by astrocytes [112].
These potential uses may be due to its high oxygen radical
scavenging activity or its ability to inhibit xanthine oxidase
and lipid peroxidation in vitro. Furthermore, quercetin
reliably
exerts
agent-
induced toxicity [56] and increases the resistance of neu-
rons to oxidative stress and excitotoxicity by modulating
the pathways of cell death. Other studies of quercetin have
shown that it produces an antiinﬂammatory effect [40] by
inhibiting iNOS [79] and regulating the expression of
COX-2 [6], via mechanisms that activate cell senescence
and autophagy [94]. Its ability to penetrate the blood-brain
barrier and its protective effect against ischemia [146] has
been reported. Quercetin treatment attenuated microglial
activation in the hippocampus and the amygdala of the AD
mouse model, and a similar result was observed in a 3-
nitropropionic acid-induced Huntington disease model. In
a systematic review studying the efﬁcacy of quercetin on
animal AD models, evidence showed the therapeutic po-
tential of quercetin on AD [151].
Resveratrol in healthy brain aging
Resveratrol was ﬁrst isolated from white hellebore roots
(Veratrum grandiﬂorum O. Loes). Resveratrol (3,5,40-
trihydroxy-trans-stilbene)
polyphenolic
secondary
metabolite that has a phytoalexin role and is commonly
found in grapevines (Vitis vinifera), grape juice, and wine.
It offers neuroprotective effects against a number of
neurodegenerative diseases due to its antioxidant, antiin-
ﬂammatory, and metal-chelating properties [122]. Resver-
atrol can also activate sirtuin 1(SIRT1), which acts as a
therapeutic target for the treatment of age-related degen-
erative diseases [3]. Resveratrol controls the maintenance
and repair processes in the body by increasing the SIRT1
activity, deacetylation of proliferator-activated receptor
gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a), and mitochondrial
biogenesis [122]. Resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, offers
protection to SK-N-BE cells from oxidative stress and
cytotoxicity generated by amyloid-beta (Ab) peptide and
alpha-synuclein [3]. It exerts protective effects on other
neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, ALS, and
HD. Chronic administration of resveratrol prevents cogni-
tive impairment and oxidative stress induced by intra-
cerebroventricular
injection
streptozotocin
[109].
Resveratrol inhibits the formation and extension of Ab ﬁ-
brils and destabilizes ﬁbrillized Ab [91]. Furthermore,
resveratrol reduces Ab secretion from different cell lines
[78] and prevents neurodegeneration and learning deﬁcit in
the hippocampus [64]. Experimental and epidemiological
studies have shown that resveratrol, together with other
ﬂavonoids such as catechin, a polyphenolic compound
enriched in green tea, may have synergistic effects to
improve age-related cognitive decline in PD and AD [122].
Ascorbic acid in healthy brain aging
Ascorbic acid is essential for various physiological pro-
cesses in the human body. There is a very high ascorbate
content in the hippocampus and neocortex of the human
brain. Ascorbic acid, being an antioxidant, acts directly by
scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced
during normal cell metabolism [49]. Ascorbate inactivates
superoxide radicals which are the major byproducts of
metabolism in the neuronal mitochondria. Ascorbic acid
modulates the activity of glutamate as well as g-amino-
butyric acid (GABA) receptors [15,57]. It has been shown
to prevent excitotoxic damage caused by excessive extra-
cellular glutamate leading to hyperpolarization of the N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptor and therefore to neuronal
damage [103]. In addition, ascorbic acid is a key factor in
the recycling of other antioxidants, e.g., a-tocopherol
(Vitamin E). a-tocopherol, found in all biological mem-
branes, is involved in preventing lipid peroxidation by
removing peroxyl radicals. During this process, a-tocoph-
erol is oxidized to the a-tocopheroxyl radical, which can
result in harmful effects. The ascorbate reduces the toco-
pheroxyl radical back to tocopherol and then its oxidized
form is recycled by enzymatic systems using NADH or
NADPH [84]. Hence, ascorbic acid is considered to be an
important neuroprotective agent.
Using the AD mouse model, 5XFAD, treatment with
ascorbic acid reduces amyloid plaques, resulting in
reduced blood-brain barrier disruption and prevention of
abnormal mitochondrial morphology [65]. Ascorbic acid
restores behavioral deﬁcits and reduces Ab oligomers
formation along with reduced brain oxidative damage and
decreased ratio of soluble Ab42 to Ab40, a characteristic
indicator of AD progression [86]. It abolishes the increase
in intracellular calcium and cell death induced by Ab in
PC12 cells [142]. In rats that received hippocampal (CA1)
injection of ﬁbrillar Ab, it reduced oxidative stress
markers and proinﬂammatory cytokines [99]. Our lab has
previously reported a reduction in the level of protein

carbonyls, a marker of protein oxidation, upon adminis-
tration of ascorbic acid in aged mice [25]. Ascorbic acid
therapeutic effects are attributed to its ability to scavenge
free radicals, prevention of membrane lipid peroxidation,
modulation of neuronal bioenergetics, and through its
antiproteolytic properties.
Ascorbate exhibits a signiﬁcant effect on a-synuclein by
directly reducing a-synuclein-Cu2þ (which accelerates the
formation of toxic aggregates) to a-synuclein-Cuþ, setting
up a redox cycle in which O2 is reduced to H2O2 and
cellular oxidants are continuously exhausted [132]. In
patients with severe PD, lymphocyte ascorbate levels were
lower in comparison to patients at less severe stages,
indicating that lymphocyte ascorbate levels could be a
potential biomarker for the disease progression [52]. In
addition, combinations of two or more antioxidants have
led to increased beneﬁcial outcomes on learning and onto
decreased oxidative stress [114] when compared to each
antioxidant alone. In rodents, the combinations of ascorbic
acid and a-tocopherol have been shown to prevent
homocysteine-induced functional impairments [96], reduce
age-associated impairments in cognitive function [4] and
protect against intermittent cold exposure-induced oxida-
tive stress in the hypothalamus and cortex of old rats [5]
thus providing evidence of a synergistic effect.
a-Tocopherol in healthy brain aging
a-Tocopherol, a fat-soluble vitamin, includes eight struc-
turally related lipid-soluble compounds with potent anti-
oxidant properties consisting of four tocopherols and four
tocotrienols: a (alpha), b (beta), g (gamma), and d (delta).
a-tocopherol is the most abundant and bioavailable form of
vitamin E in humans and rodents. It is an essential micro-
nutrient for humans, useful for maintaining the integrity of
cell membranes. Seeds and edible oils, such as those of
almond, peanuts, olive, palm oil, canola, corn, and soybean,
contain high levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols. The
vital role of a-tocopherol is its antioxidant action and thus it
is the most important lipophilic radical scavenging anti-
oxidant in vivo. It scavenges free radicals mainly by
hydrogen atom transfer reaction obtaining a nonradical
product and a radical that may react with another radical to
give a stable product, attack lipids, or react with a reducing
agent such as ascorbic acid or ubiquinol to regenerate
tocopherol [90]. a-Tocopherol acts as chain-breaking
antioxidant in lipoproteins and cell membranes, limiting
lipid peroxidation and maintaining membrane integrity
[37].
Excessive ROS production consequently leads to lipid
peroxidation, protein oxidation, tau hyperphosphorylation,
which results in toxic effects on synapses and neurons. A
high intake of a-tocopherol by patients with mild to mod-
erate AD is linked to preventing or slowing the progression
of the disease and producing neuroprotective effects [29].
a-Tocopherol exerts a positive action on tau hyper-
phosphorylation, a hallmark of AD. A dietary supplemen-
tation with a-tocopherol exerts a protective action against
oxidative insults in Apo E-deﬁcient mice and prevents the
deﬁcits in cognition and neuropathologic alterations [131].
AD brains are characterized by increased acetylcholines-
terase levels. a-tocopherol has been shown to inhibit AChE
activity and linked to reduced risk of AD [77].
Crocin in healthy brain aging
Crocus sativus L. is a perennial, stemless herb, belonging
to the Iridaceae family, cultivated in most Mediterranean
countries and in Iran, India, and China. C. sativus extract
has indicated that carotenoids (crocins, crocetin, pic-
rocrocin, and safranal) and glycosides (quercetin and
kaempferol) are its main bioactive constituents which
possess antioxidant, antiinﬂammatory, and neuroprotective
properties [1]. Crocin is a water-soluble carotenoid found in
C. sativus, which has potential effects against neurode-
generative pathologies such as PD. Saffron, dried golden
stigmas of the crocus, has been reported to be involved in
the modulation of proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-1b,
IL-6, TNF-a), oxidative stress markers (ROS), immune
factors such as TGF-b, leukotriene B4 [11]. It improves
learning and memory, as well as protects neurons. Crocin
has multifunctional neuroprotective activities and has
immense potential in the treatment of AD [32]. It improves
locomotor activities in animal models [58], protects against
oxidative stress and cerebral ischemia [153], and maintains
blood-brain barrier integrity [150]. Administrations of
crocin
(a-crocin;
20 mg/kg)
crocetin
(50 mg/kg)
against traumatic brain injury in mice have revealed their
neuroinﬂammatory protective effects by the amelioration of
neurological severity score, brain edema, a decrease in
microglial
activation,
release
several
proin-
ﬂammatory cytokines [133], and a decrease in the lipo-
polysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis in organotypic
hippocampal slice cultures [88].
Ellagic acid in healthy brain aging
Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenol compound abundantly
present in berries (strawberry, raspberry, cloudberry, and
blueberry), grapes, pomegranate, almonds, walnuts, and
their beverages [130]. EA possesses antioxidant [157],
antiinﬂammatory [19], neurorestoration [73], and immune-
modulatory [61] properties. The antioxidant activity of EA
is due to its direct free radical scavenging property and
potentiation of endogenous antioxidants like NADPH:
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-
1(HO-1), GSH, SOD, catalase, glutathione reductase, and
glutathione peroxidase [20]. Activities of iNOS, COX-2, 5-

## Page 147

LOX (5-lipoxygenase), ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion
molecule 1), and VCAM-1(vascular cell adhesion protein
1) are shown to be inhibited by EA [81]. It inhibits also the
AChE activity [31], modulates cholinergic function and
long term potentiation (LTP) in brain indicating its neuro-
protective and cognitive abilities [21]. EA present in
pomegranate juice and walnut extracts [87] helps in the
reduction of Ab40-42-plaque deposition in brain and
improves memory in rodents. EA has been reported with
the prevention of Ab-peptide neurotoxicity [81], ﬁbrillar
aggregation of Ab-peptides in brain [30], and inhibition of
BACE-1 activity [113]. EA signiﬁcantly abrogates the
Ab25-35 induced elevation in oxidative stress, inﬂammation
(NF-kB activity), and AChE activities in rat brain. It
provides protection from neuroinﬂammation by down-
regulating the expression of several proinﬂammatory
cytokines, e.g., TNF-a [80]. Using the APP/PS1 transgenic
mouse model, EA has been shown to inhibit the release of
inﬂammatory cytokines by microglia and amyloid plaques,
thereby portraying the therapeutic beneﬁt in AD [98].
Reduction in cerebral infarct size and improvement in
the memory have been seen upon EA administration in
rats [62].
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in healthy
brain aging
EGCG
polyphenol
catechin,
ester
epi-
gallocatechin and gallic acid [70], which is found in high
abundance in tea leaves including green tea. EGCG is a
product of the plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze and is
known to possess antioxidant, metal-chelating, antiin-
ﬂammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antiapoptotic properties
[117]. Tea consumption was associated with a low preva-
lence of AD and reduced cognitive impairment in elderly
population [144]. A meta-analysis indicated that tea intake
signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of cognitive disorders and
was inversely associated with the risk of cognitive
impairment and ungrouped cognitive disorders [75].
Studies have shown that green tea catechins inhibit Ab
and tau protein, exhibiting a potential to prevent and treat
AD. EGCG signiﬁcantly reduced the accumulation of Ab
and released neuronal injury in the hippocampus of AD
mouse model. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (20 mg/kg) for
60 days and orally treated EGCG (50 mg/kg) in the trans-
genic AD mouse model for 6 months have been found to
regulate the tau protein proﬁle and markedly suppress the
phosphorylated tau isoforms [97].
Several epidemiological studies indicated tea’s beneﬁ-
cial effect on PD. In a case-controlled study with 249 PD
cases and 368 control subjects, the intake of coffee, black
tea, and Japanese and Chinese teas was inversely associated
with the risk of PD [123]. A greater intake of epicatechin
(EC) and proanthocyanidin dimers was associated with a
lower risk of PD [39]. It was postulated that dietary EC may
stimulate the phosphorylation of the transcription factor
CREB protein, a regulator of neuronal viability and syn-
aptic plasticity, and inhibit NADPH oxidase activity.
Proanthocyanidins may increase brain dopamine concen-
trations, inhibit monoamine oxidase-A activity, and reduce
the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic loss [39]
implying that catechin derivatives may be involved in tea’s
beneﬁcial effects on PD. Experiments with animal and
human cell models showed that the intake of tea com-
pounds may activate FOXO gene expression, which in turn
may positively affect cognitive function in the elderly
population [148]. Malondialdehyde-modiﬁed low-density
lipoprotein, a marker of oxidative stress, was signiﬁcantly
lower in the drinkers of green tea than the placebo group
[51]. EGCG consumption also increased self-rated calm-
ness and reduced self-rated stress exhibiting EGCG’s
relaxing and refreshing properties, a beneﬁcial effect of
green tea intake [106].
In an experiment using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model,
EGCG treatment restored the movement behavior of the
mice impaired by MPTP and prevented MPTP toxicity in
tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra
pars compacta region [154]. Additionally, EGCG reduced
the serum levels of inﬂammatory factors, TNF-a and IL6
indicating that EGCG exerts neuroprotective effects in the
PD mouse model possibly through modulating peripheral
immune responses. These studies suggest the potential use
of green tea polyphenol as a therapeutic agent for the
prevention and treatment of PD.
The antioxidant and metal chelation activities of EGCG
and green tea catechins (GTCs) are important for the pre-
vention of neurodegenerative diseases. Iron in the ferrous
form, Fe(II), can react with hydrogen peroxide via the
Fenton reaction, leading to the generation of hydroxyl
radicals that are extremely reactive and damage cellular
components [60]. Copper is able to form a high-afﬁnity
complex with Ab, and the oxidation reactions by Cu(II)-
Ab complexes lead to the formation of Cu(I)-Ab, which is
involved in neurotoxicity via radical cation and hydroxyl
radical generation. EGCG and GTCs containing many hy-
droxyl groups in their structures have antioxidant property
to terminate free radical chain reactions and play the role of
chelator of redox-active metals [55].
Calorie restriction mimetic in healthy brain
Caloric restriction (CR), a reduction in calories without
malnutrition, increases both health and lifespan across
numerous organisms, including humans, and has been
shown to prevent age-related diseases and promoting
healthier, longer lifespans [68,110]. A diet consisting of

35% of the ad libitum intake but enriched with vitamins and
minerals showed that mice lived an average of 53 months,
compared to 35 months in the control ad libitum-fed group
[138]. CR causes a decrease in the circulating levels of both
insulin and glucose, leading to decreased insulin signaling
thereby promoting increased lifespan [149]. Major nutrient-
sensing
pathways,
mammalian
target
rapamycin
(mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuins,
and insulin/IGF-1 sense the availability of macronutrients
(glucose, amino acids, and lipids) or the energy status of the
cell (AMP/ATP or NADþ/NADH ratio) and regulate
several cellular processes such as autophagy, metabolism,
oxidative stress, and gene expression [45,66]. These
different nutrient sensors detect the changes in the level of
nutrients and the metabolic status of the cells during CR
and thereby regulate various cellular processes resulting in
improved neuronal plasticity and better cognition [35]. CR
inhibits mTOR leading to the activation of autophagy,
which in turn protects the hippocampal neurons from
damage and thereby mitigates the age-associated cognitive
decline [27].
The age-dependent neuronal loss occurs in selected
group of neurons such as cholinergic neurons of the fore-
brain and of the sympathetic neurons [134]. Neurons of
hippocampus CA1 region, frontal cortex, and amygdala are
more sensitive to oxidative stress as compared to the neu-
rons of hippocampal CA3 regions [135]. Oxidative stress
may signiﬁcantly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and

compared to the younger ones [26].
CR is documented to increase the expression of genes
involved with DNA repair, which will increase the efﬁ-
ciency at which cells cope with oxidative damage. CR has
shown to activate transcription factors controlling gene
expression leading to increased levels of proteins mediating
cellular stress responses. SIRT1 activation via CR results in
decreased levels of inﬂammation by downregulation of
genes encoding cytokines [82]. In macrophages, SIRT1
deacetylation
RelA/p65
component of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) complex [121].
The forkhead family transcription factor, FOXO3a is a key
regulator of the insulin receptor (IR)/insulinlike growth
factor-I signaling pathway mediating extension of lifespan.
CR stimulates the hyperphosphorylation of FOXO3a
leading to its exclusion from the nucleus, which corre-
sponds to an attenuation of AD in AD model, Tg2576 mice
indicating a link between CR, FOXO3a, and age-related
neurological pathologies [95]. PPAR and SIRT1 levels
are decreased in aged individuals leading to increased
inﬂammation. CR has been shown to restore SIRT1 and
PPARg expression, decreasing inﬂammatory responses.
HIF-1a, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, is associated
with inﬂammation and oxidative stress. Its activity is
increased in aged rats, leading to upregulation of genes
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor,
hemeoxygenase-1(HO-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS), and erythropoietin (EPO). CR has been shown to
decrease the expression of HIF-1a-mediated genes thereby
decreasing inﬂammation [156].
Many people may not follow the regular CR regimens;
keeping this in mind, nutraceuticals are prescribed to
rescue such individuals by providing health beneﬁts.
These nutraceuticals act as CR mimetic, as if individuals
have followed the CR, in giving rise to the biochemical
and molecular modulations of CR for healthy brain aging
(Fig. 9.2). Nutraceuticals such as resveratrol, curcumin,
EGCG, quercetin, and many others mentioned in the text
mimic a similar action as that of the CR. In future,
such nutraceuticals could be of great beneﬁt as replace-
ment of pharmaceuticals in providing health beneﬁts to
elderly population.

The World Health Organization has predicted that by 2050
there will be approximately 1.5 billion people aged 65
years worldwide [1]; therefore, there is an urgent need to
ﬁnd ways to prevent or reduce age-related cognitive
changes in this population.
It is known that the brain is extremely susceptible to
oxidative damage: this is thought to be due to its high
metabolic load and the presence within the plasma mem-
brane of the neural cells of oxidizable substances such as
polyunsaturated fatty acids [2]. If free radicals overwhelm
the body’s regulatory ability, then this imbalance creates

oxidative stress. Free radicals can attack DNA, proteins,
and lipids within the neural cells, and this inﬂammatory
process is considered to be an important factor in the
pathophysiology of age-related neurodegenerative disease
[3] such as Alzheimer disease (AD) [4,5], vascular de-
mentia, and Parkinson disease (PD) [6]. Epidemiological
studies have suggested that dietary modulation such as
regular intake of ﬂavonoid-rich foods may be associated
with a 50% reduction in the risk of dementia, a preservation
of cognitive performance with aging, a delay in the onset of
AD, and a reduction in the risk of developing PD [7].
Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in the
potential of polyphenols to improve memory, learning, and
general cognitive ability [8,9,10]. A substantial body of
animal behavioral research suggests that intake of blueberry
or strawberry preparations is effective at reversing age-
related deﬁcits in spatial working memory [11,12,13,14,15]
and improving object recognition memory [16]. Human in-
vestigations have also suggested that fruit and vegetables
may have a positive impact on memory [17,18,19,20,21].
Pomegranate [22], tea [23], Ginkgo biloba [24,25,26,27],
orange juice [28,29,31], grape juice [32], cocoa ﬂavanols
[33], and pure ﬂavanols such as quercetin, rutin [34], and
ﬁsetin [35] have all been shown to be beneﬁcial in reversing
neuronal and behavioral aging [7].
Recently, biophenol-rich fruits have been found to
possess both antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory effects that
explain the recent surge of interest in their roles in the
reduction of oxidative stress and the inﬂammatory processes
involved in cognitive deﬁcits, the maintenance of cognitive
function in adults [36], and their potential as neuroprotective
and therapeutic nutrients in treatment of cognitive function
decline [37]. A decline in multiple domains of cognitive
function, including memory and processing speed, usually
accompanies aging. As effective treatments for neurode-
generative disorders are scarce, it can be said that nutritional
intervention throughout adult life might contribute toward
optimal cognitive functioning [38]. The impairment of
endothelial function is directly related to aging and an as-
sociation between decreased cerebral perfusion and dementia
has been shown. Intake of cocoa, grapes, berries, and
pomegranate rich in ﬂavonoids has been shown to increase
cerebral blood ﬂow, which ensures a constant delivery of
oxygen and glucose to the brain, thus improving memory
and cognition [39,29,31,9].
An increasing number of ﬂavonoids have been shown
to delay the initiation of and/or inhibit the development of
AD and related neurodegenerative disorders [40,41,27].
Cognitive aging deﬁcits have shown to be potentially
reversed through speciﬁc botanical extracts in rodent and
human models, suggesting a possible therapeutic use in
dementia [42]. The vascular system effects may also lead
to improved cognitive performance through increased
brain blood ﬂow and an ability to initiate neurogenesis in
the hippocampus [31]. Together these processes act to
maintain the number and quality of neural connections in
key brain regions, and thus ﬂavonoids have the potential
to prevent the progression of neurodegenerative pathology
and to promote cognitive performance. Suggested mech-
anisms include the ability to reduce neuronal damage and
losses induced by neurotoxicity such as oxidative stress
and neuroinﬂammation and the inhibition of amyloid b
generation and aggregation [43].
Pomegranate is known to be a particularly rich source
of fruit polyphenols with antioxidant potency greater than
many other fruits [44,45,46]. In addition to ﬂavonoids
such as delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonidin [47],
pomegranate species contain hydrolyzable tannins called
punicalagins which are broken down into ellagic acid. The
gut converts these ellagitannins into urolithins which are
small molecules that appear to cross the blain-blood bar-
rier and possess antioxidant properties [48,6]. Ropacki
et al. [49] examined the impact of pomegranate intake on
memory performance after cardiac surgery on 10 patients
and showed that the placebo group had signiﬁcant de-
ﬁciencies in memory retention postsurgery compared to
the pomegranate group. Al-Dujaili and colleagues con-
ducted a narrative review of the effect of pomegranate and
other biophenols on cognition [17] and concluded that
animal and human studies are needed to investigate the
effect of pomegranate extract on age-related cognitive
decline. Acute studies have been conducted to understand
the possible range of effects of ﬂavonoids, and the
mechanisms of action [18]. The aim of this research was to
examine the effect of acute intake of pomegranate extract
(PE; Pomanox 30, Euromed, Mollet del Vallès, Spain) on
various aspects of cognitive function, including memory
and mood in healthy adult participants.

The study began on April 2014 and was completed on July
2014. This trial was registered as ClinicalTrials.gov
Identiﬁer: NCT02935777. Twenty healthy adults (7 men,
13 women) were recruited to the study. The age of the
participants ranged from 18 to 64 years with mean age of
35.8  15.5 years. Mean height was 1.73  0.1 m and
weight 76.1  12.2 kg, which resulted in a mean BMI of
25.6  15.1 kg/m2. Seventeen participants self-identiﬁed
as European, two as Middle Eastern, and one as Asian.
All enrolled subjects completed the study. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria were conﬁrmed from a screening ques-
tionnaire and initial interviews. Participants were consid-
ered for inclusion in the study if they were healthy, aged
between 18 and 65 years old, and enjoyed computer tasks.
Exclusions applied for conditions which would affect
cognitive function or interfere with intervention proced-
ures. These included known cognitive impairment; diag-
nosis with any neurological, psychiatric, or medical
condition, which could affect cognitive function; use of
any prescription, herbal, or recreational drugs; gastroin-
testinal disease; pregnancy or breastfeeding; and pome-
granate allergy.
Treatment protocol
Participants were initially informed about the study require-
ments and given a copy of the participant information sheet.
Completion of the medical screening questionnaire was then
performed with the researcher during the screening interview
toensurethatparticipantsmettheessential studycriteria.After
informed consent was given, demographic information and
measurements of age, height, weight, ethnicity, and gender
were recorded. Participants also completed a training and
practice session on the Computerised Mental Performance
Assessment System (COMPASS) Version 4.2.1 software
developed by Northumbria University (Newcastle-upon-
Tyne, United Kingdom) that assesses cognitive function. This
familiarized each participant with the software and attenuated
any practice effects.
Saliva containers and instructions for saliva collection
were provided. On each study day, saliva (2e3 mL) was
collected after wakening and washing out the mouth, but
before brushing teeth. Participants were randomly assigned
to either the PE or placebo group (PL). The researcher and
participants were both blinded as to which capsules were
consumed until data collection was complete. The PE and
PL capsules looked identical and were placed in sealed,
labeled, preprepared, opaque containers.
On the day prior to testing, participants were requested
to abstain from alcohol, recreational drugs, and vigorous
exercise. Participants were also required to restrict herbal
extracts, food supplements, and polyphenols such as dark
chocolate, fruit rich in polyphenols and antioxidants (dark/

red grapes and their juices; berry fruits and their juices;
green tea, black tea, and coffee; pomegranate and juices;
dark chocolate; red wine; and soy and soy products) to less
than three portions for 24 h before their testing sessions. A
24 h pretest food diary was completed to assist with
compliance and participants were also advised to have a
good night’s sleep (at least 6e8 h) before the intervention
visit. The randomization process was carried out by an
independent technician who used an internet random
number generator site [50] to allocate treatment.
The second and third participant visits which took place
in the laboratory were 7 days apart and these constituted the
intervention phase. Each visit lasted for approximately 3 h
between 9 a.m. and 12 noon. The assessments for both arms
at baseline and postintervention were performed at the same
time of day in order to mirror conditions for both arms as
closely as possible. Participants were requested to have the
same breakfast on the days of the intervention visits.
Mornings were chosen for this study as it had been
observed by Ref. [51] that when nutritional manipulations
were made at midday, performance on attention and reac-
tion time tasks was usually impaired. Caffeine is well
known to increase alertness impacting cognitive function,
and thus participants were asked to abstain from tea and
coffee overnight and on the morning of the intervention.
The prestudy saliva collection was completed at home by
participants early in the morning after rising on the day of
each intervention. The samples were then frozen at 20C
until analysis was performed for cortisol and cortisone
levels to provide a biochemical marker for stress levels.
The ﬁrst computerized cognitive test battery was
administered in the laboratory after taking baseline blood
pressure (BP) and heart rate. Each COMPASS test lasted
approximately 45 min. All assessments were performed on
the same QMU laptop computer which was used by indi-
vidual participants at every baseline and postdose assess-
ment. There is a large bank of different stimuli for each
cognitive test and all stimuli were randomized across par-
ticipants and assessments and the results were automati-
cally recorded by the software with the exception of the
paper and pen tasks (word recall) which were scored
manually. Participants were then given either two PE or
two PL capsules, with water by mouth. This was followed
by a 1 h absorption period (spent in a quiet resting place)
before the next test session began. Cognitive testing was
completed once more and then a second, postintervention,
saliva sample was collected. Systolic and diastolic BP and
heart rate were also measured. Participants completed the
intervention at around 12 noon. The cognitive testing was
conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.
Pomegranate extract and placebo capsule
proﬁles
Each 1.0 g soft gelatinous PE capsule (PE produced pro-
cessing pomegranates cultivated in Mediterranean regions
of Spain with a proprietary osmotized water-only extrac-
tion technology, the Pure-Hydro Process) contains 328 mg
total polyphenols, including punicalagins and other bio-
phenols (e.g., ﬂavonoids, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins).
The other contents were maltodextrins. PE is standardized
to 30% punicalagins (alpha and beta). Placebo capsules
consisted solely of maltodextrins (from potato starch). The
treatment dose of two capsules provided a combined
656 mg dose of total biophenols (420 mg of punicalagins).
Both PE and PL capsules provided a negligible amount of
energy (6.52 kcal ¼ 27.28 kJ) per capsule.
Biochemical and physiological measures
Salivary glucocorticoids
Changes in the steroid hormones cortisol and cortisone
found in saliva are important markers of stress and car-
diovascular disease (CVD) risk. Differing patterns of

glucocorticoid (GC) secretions have been reported partic-
ularly in older adults, with some individuals attaining very
high levels of GCs, while others maintain moderate levels.
A high cortisol level impairs cognitive function, especially
in the elderly, as base levels can rise with age [52]. This
study investigated whether acute PE intake affected cortisol
levels after a 1 h absorption period. Morning (pretest) and
noon (posttest) levels were compared between and within
intervention arms. Cortisol and cortisone levels were
estimated by using highly speciﬁc and sensitive ELISA
methods developed by Al-Dujaili et al. [53,54]. Using their
optimized method of collecting saliva for steroid hormone
determination
ensured
contamination
occurred in saliva samples. Mean cortisol and cortisone
levels that were within the normal ranges would conﬁrm
that the participant population had normal patterns of GCs,
stress, and CVD risk and that these risk factors would not
affect the intervention results [53,55].
Blood pressure
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured for all par-
ticipants at a sitting position using a digital BP monitor
(UA-767 Plus 30, A&D Company, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).
Readings were taken in triplicate before the ﬁrst baseline
test 10 min after arrival and then once more following
postdose completion of the cognitive tasks. An average of
the readings was calculated for each time point since BP is
one of the physiological measures of stress and in test
situations, stress levels can inﬂuence the results obtained.
Any signiﬁcant differences in BP could be discussed
alongside saliva GC markers and assist in the interpretation
of results.
Computerized Mental Performance Assessment
System (COMPASS) for cognitive and mood
assessment
All participant cognitive and mood function assessments
were conducted using COMPASS, a purpose-designed
software application for the ﬂexible delivery of randomly
generated, parallel versions of standard and novel cognitive
assessment tasks [56]. The tasks completed at baseline and
postintervention were identical. Various forms and durations
of cognitive demand tests (including COMPASS) have been
validated and used in recent studies investigating the effect
of nutritional and herbal supplements [57,33,58].
COMPASS creates a full set of randomized stimuli for
every single assessment performed by each individual
participant, which ensures that participants do not become
familiar with the test stimuli as time progresses. It also
provides preprogrammed word lists and pictures devel-
oped for healthy adults, allowing research to be conducted
across age groups or in other languages. It is easy to
conﬁgure, only requiring that the number of participants,
assessments, stimulus intervals, and preprogrammed tests
are chosen during the setup procedure. The program can
then be reloaded as required with a set of defaults within
COMPASS where the speed of presentation, length of
tasks, and the number of stimuli can be changed for every
task assessment. The data produced from each participant

comprised standard psychometric tasks assessing cognitive
function across a range of different domains [32,60]. A trial
session was provided for participants to become familiar
with the study software and procedures shortly before the
intervention. All sessions were performed in a quiet room
with no distraction on a Toshiba Tecra A11-11H laptop with
Windows 7 software and a vPro i5 Intel core. A training
pack on COMPASS was given to each participant, which
included detailed task instructions to read before the practice
day with the help of the researcher.
Task order and cognitive function tested
The cognitive tasks were performed by participants during
each testing session as shown in Fig. 10.3. The same tasks
were applied pre- and postintervention, but the content of
each, although drawn from the same database, was unique,
e.g., the photographs in the picture presentation may have
been completely different pre- and postintervention, but the
task remained the same.

Statistics
The aim of this study was to examine whether one of two
different treatments (PE vs. PL) was more effective in
improving aspects of cognitive function. As the participants
underwent two conditions, the factors were time (pre and
post) and treatment (PE and PL). The dependent variable
was the measure of cognitive function, i.e., each cognitive
test. All 20 participants underwent treatment with both PE
and PL.

All data were analyzed using SPSS versions 23 or 24
(Version 23.0 [released 2015] or Version 24.0 [released
2016], Armonk, NY; IBM Corp) and expressed as means,
SDs, and standard error of the mean (SE). Independent t
tests were performed on baseline values for each treatment
type to investigate the possibility of any differences in
cognitive performance and mood pretreatment. In order to
record participant physiological, biochemical, and cogni-
tive test scores for comparisons, as well as determining any
changes in these parameters within the groups, the differ-
ence in the treatment effect (baseline score d postdose
score) was examined using paired t tests. All values were
unadjusted.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to
highlight differences between the treatment groups for

effects.
in-
teractions were explored with pairwise comparisons using
ANOVA and the Bonferroni test. Effects of treatment values
(F) are presented with adjusted means (M) and SE. The
effect of treatment on BP, heart rate, and cortisone and
cortisol levels and their ratios were tested using ANCOVA
with SPSS for Windows version 23.0 [30]. Baseline pre-
treatment values were included as covariates, posttreatment
values as the dependent variables, and the type of treatment
as ﬁxed factors.
In order to examine treatment effects in this study,
postdose cognitive data were analyzed using a linear mixed
model (LMM) with treatment, order, and treatment versus
order as ﬁxed effects, including the respective baseline as a
covariate. Signiﬁcant interactions were explored with
pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni post hoc test.
Signiﬁcance was deﬁned at P  .05.
Biochemical and cardiovascular measures
No signiﬁcant differences between pre- and postdose
effects on biochemical and cardiovascular measures were
observed in either the PE or PL groups. There were
signiﬁcant reductions in cortisol and cortisone salivary
concentration mainly due to the daily circadian rhythm of
glucocorticoids.
interactions
explored with pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni
test, and there were no signiﬁcant differences between the
two groups.
Assessment of cognitive function
Within-group effects
At baseline, independent t test results showed that there
were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in cognitive
performance or in physiological and biochemical measures
between the PE and PL groups.
Simple analysis makes use of the within-participant
comparison and here paired t tests are appropriate for
continuous outcome measures. Mean unadjusted predose
baseline and postdose scores for the PE group were
calculated for a wide range of cognitive tests under
laboratory conditions using a laptop and keyboard. To
simplify the large number of outcome measures generated
and facilitate discussion, only signiﬁcant results for paired
t test preepost differences are illustrated in Table 10.1 and
Fig. 10.4. It was observed that overall reaction time
for logical reasoning tasks was signiﬁcantly shorter after
PE sessions (P < .001): correct answer reaction time
(P < .001); reaction time for answering “true” (P ¼ .02);
faster
reaction
time
answering
“false”
(P < .001). Working memory tests were also improved:
PE sessions produced signiﬁcantly more total serial sub-
tractions (P < .001) and more correct serial subtraction
responses (P ¼ .04). Moreover, the Corsi block lite
reaction time test was conducted in less time post-PE
intake (P ¼ .05). For all the other parameters, no signiﬁ-
cant changes were observed between pre- and post-
treatments.
Between-group effects
Two-way ANOVA of biochemical and physiological var-
iables showed that there were no signiﬁcant differences
between the PE and PL treatments. Heart rate dropped
signiﬁcantly within both groups, and this may be attributed
to the more sedentary activity of participants as the test
sessions progressed.
There was a signiﬁcant reduction in cortisol and corti-
sone levels in both PE and PL groups but no treatment
effect between groups. There is a natural circadian rhythm
fall in cortisol and cortisone levels from early morning to
midday; these results were therefore as expected. The
baseline values provided a measure of how stressed a
participant was. If the cortisol measurement was very high
(>40 nmole), a participant could be excluded from the
study. From these results, the data show that all measure-
ments are as expected, and none were impaired or
compromised by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
Thus, they are apparently normal in terms of adrenal
function and the results for cognitive function can be
considered to be viable.
The LMM analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant
interaction between treatment and order for most of the
outcome measures (P > .05) except that a signiﬁcant effect
of treatment was found for two cognitive measures in the
picture recognition test: picture recognition % accuracy and

Discussion
The results of the current study demonstrate for the ﬁrst
time that acute consumption of PE can improve aspects of
cognitive performance in healthy adults. Pomegranate
extract intake signiﬁcantly improved executive function
(logical reasoning tasks) and working memory (number of
serial subtractions and Corsi block lite reaction time)
indicators. Bearing in mind that our study was fully
randomized and double-blinded and when PL compared to
the nonbiophenol placebo, it also increased the accuracy of
responses in the picture recognition cognitive tasks.
Participants had a signiﬁcantly higher accuracy of correct
picture recognition in the delayed picture recognition task
(determining whether they had seen a picture or not before)
after consuming PE than with PL. They also had a signif-
icantly higher accuracy of correctly identifying pictures
which had been part of the group presented earlier in the
test, compared to PL.
Delayed picture recognition tasks examine aspects of
secondary (long-term) memory, both semantic and episodic
[49]. Episodic memory performance is thought to decline
from middle age onwards, particularly for recall in normal
aging, although not as much for recognition. This decline is
also a characteristic of the memory loss seen in AD [61]. If
episodic memory can be enhanced through the use of PE as

this study suggests, and consequently the process of decline
in aging or disease be diminished or slowed down, PE
could contribute positively toward ameliorating negative
cognitive aging conditions. These ﬁndings of signiﬁcant
effects of acute treatment on long-term and working
memory are important. Previous studies failed to ﬁnd any
acute effects on memory either in young [32], middle-aged
[28], or elderly participants [62]. However, acute supple-
mentation with wild blueberry was shown to improve
memory in 7- to10-year-old children [43]. This led [18] to

polyphenol-rich food. [18] argued that the current evi-
dence suggests that ﬂavonoids may be beneﬁcial for
attention, working memory, and psychomotor processing
speed in a general population and that their effects on
cognitive outcomes are mediated by age. They stated that
the effects on episodic memory were less well deﬁned and

appeared to be restricted to child or older adult pop-
ulations. The signiﬁcant treatment effects of PE on picture
recognition in this study suggest that these effects on
episodic memory occur over a wider age range (18e65
years) than has previously been thought. Bell et al. rec-
ommended that further studies should be undertaken to
determine age-group differences, allowing direct com-
parison of different participant groups within the same
study [18]. The dawning realization of both the human and
ﬁnancial costs of cognitive degeneration has created a
strong interest in developing drugs capable of enhancing
memory and learning [9]. considered that there was a
strong possibility that certain nutrients, especially fruit-
derived ﬂavonoids, could function as precursors for the
development of new memory-enhancing drugs. It appears
that the beneﬁcial effects of biophenol-rich fruits on
cognition of healthy subjects or cognitive deﬁcits related
to aging, mild and postoperative cognitive impairment,
and AD present a safe and effective approach for memory
domain improvement.
The study by Haskell-Ramsay et al. on the acute effects
of purple grape juice reported on the treatment effects for
the attention tasks RTs composite score [32]. This was
created from simple and choice RTs as well as the digit
vigilance RT. Similar effects of treatment on attention tasks
were not observed in this study. This study also used
COMPASS and the composite score for memory accuracy
showed no signiﬁcant differences of treatment, the score
being created from more than one cognitive test (involving
numeric working memory, word recall and recognition, as
well as picture recognition). Despite the mean age being
much higher in the current study than in the Haskell-
Ramsay et al. study (35.8 years [SD 15.5] vs. 21.05 years
[SD 0.89]), respectively, it may be worthwhile comparing
results for the same individual parameters of picture
recognition which showed signiﬁcant differences in treat-
ment here [32]. Our study did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
differences in treatment either within or between the Bond-
Lader mood ratings, attention and vigilance, and speed or
quality of memory. However, previous studies [63,64] from
our group identiﬁed mood improvements following chronic
administration of the same PE extract. Future studies
should perhaps focus more on chronic administration and
older volunteers, given that the elderly are most at risk of
declining cognitive function. A summary of human studies
conducted for the evaluation of cognition effects of grape
juice and berries in healthy individuals with no cognitive
decline also described positive effects for chronic grape
juice supplementation on cognitive function, particularly in
spatial memory [17]. Dementia has been shown to have a
long “pre-dementia phase,” which could last for years as a
precursor to AD. Elias et al. suggested that this phase is
characterized by patients having lower cognitive function
associated with difﬁculties in performing instrumental
activities. However, interventions initiated in individuals
with pre-dementia conditions such as mild cognitive
impairment might prevent further progression of cognitive
decline, and mild cognitive impairment may represent the
ﬁnal point at which intervention can be effective [65].
Interventional studies for mild cognitive impairment cases
showed an improvement in cognitive function in AD sug-
gesting a preventative role for pomegranate. This potential
treatment option using biophenol-rich fruit has not been
thoroughly studied.
Limitations
This was an exploratory project with only 20 volunteers
and only acute intake of PE was examined. This has limited
the power to detect differences between the PE and PL
interventions in a wide range of cognitive tasks. In addition,
stratiﬁcation, which was not possible here, could be
performed in larger studies across multiple sites with con-
siderations around different clusters such as age, activity,
gender, ethnicity. Chronic intake of PE was investigated
over 4 and 8 weeks in the earlier studies with positive
outcomes on CVD risk factors without unwanted effects
[63,64], and this was the chosen methodology of [66] and
[49] cognitive function studies.
It has been reported that it would be difﬁcult to
compare studies due to differences in dose, ﬂavonoid
source, and postprandial timepoint [18]. Our study
allowed only 1 h after treatment and this might not have
been long enough for absorption of all polyphenols
bearing in mind the diversity of the gut environment in all
volunteers. Flavonoids or their metabolites are able to
cross the blood-brain barrier and the timing of peak levels
in blood appears to correspond with the timing of cogni-
tive effects. Plasma anthocyanins and their metabolites
and vasodilatory effects are observed to peak at 1e6 h
following blueberry supplementation [67], which appears
to correspond with the peak timing of cognitive beneﬁts
observed after blueberry intake. The absorption process of
the polyphenols in PE capsules may also vary from indi-
vidual to individual, which could produce different effects
in the given time period. Bell et al. argued that the timings
of cognitive effects appear to be closely related to the
absorption and metabolism rates of the supplemented
ﬂavonoid compounds with a dose-dependent effect [9].
The earlier studies on PE have also focused on longer-term
studies of 4e8 weeks and have shown treatment cognitive
effects [20]. The 45-min length of the test battery session
may potentially beneﬁt from shortening, with any future
focus being solely on tests which displayed some differ-
ences in terms of treatment, either within or between
groups, in previous studies. Each volunteer had to

complete three sessions plus training time which was
perhaps time demanding for some. Others may have found
it difﬁcult to abstain from tea and coffee and there was no
biochemical compliance measure to determine this.
A crossover design was employed where the participants
acted as their own controls, and this was found to be more
efﬁcient than a parallel group design when researchers
expect a high correlation between patients’ responses to
different treatments [68]. The usual limitations to crossover
designs are the two assumptions that the effects of the
treatment assigned during the ﬁrst period have no residual
effect on the treatment assigned during the second period
and that the patient’s condition remains stable during both
periods [69,70]. Our study was designed to minimize these
effects by allowing a 1-week washout period. However,
carryover effects might have occurred. Moreover, studies
requiring performance on complex tasks and cognitive load
are subject to modulating or confounding factors [51]. These
include time of day (diurnal rhythm), personality type, level
of arousal, load or difﬁculty of the task, and the nature of the
task itself. These factors could be taken into consideration in
future experimental designs.
Potential mechanisms
There is now ample evidence showing that polyphenols can
improve aspects of cognitive function [71] and are able to
traverse the blood-brain barrier to varying degrees, and
some have been identiﬁed in speciﬁc brain tissues sug-
gesting direct neuroprotective and neuromodulatory actions
[20,72]. The cognitive effects of many fruits appear to be
related to their ﬂavonoid content and involve a number of
mechanisms. These include a potential antiinﬂammatory
effect that protects neurons against neurotoxin injury and
neuroinﬂammation, an ability to activate synaptic signaling,
and a capacity to improve cerebrovascular blood ﬂow [9].
Thus vasodilatory mechanisms of action may account for at
least some of the cognitive improvements observed in acute
supplementation of polyphenols [18,73]. Improvement in
memory may reﬂect reduced inﬂammation and/or enhanced
neural function in response to polyphenol intake, and
consistent antiinﬂammatory effects over a moderate time-
frame might be expected to induce cognitive-cerebral
enhancement, especially in individuals with very early
neurodegeneration [20]. Meanwhile, polyphenols as anti-
oxidants have been shown to protect neurons against
oxidative stress and neuronal injury in a number of ways
such as protecting vulnerable neurons, enhancing existing
neuronal function, stimulating neuronal regeneration [74],
and improving neuronal signaling via the reduction of
glycation end products during normal and abnormal brain
aging [75]. The effects of polyphenols on cognition and
neurodegenerative processes appear also to be mediated via
their interactions with the neuronal and glial signaling
pathways that affect gene expression and interfere with cell
death mechanisms [7].
The multifactorial process involved in accelerated aging
was recently deﬁned as “cognitive frailty” [76], a geriatric
condition including frailty syndrome and mental impair-
ment. Current developments in the search for novel
treatments that preserve cognitive function include those
for slowing down the progression of age-related mental
decline and those that treat various forms of dementia.
While today’s nootropics are increasingly targeted at
younger people looking to increase the number of pro-
ductive hours in their day, the key focus is on the aging
This current study is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst
double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial inves-
tigating cognitive responses to an acute intervention with
PE. Various pomegranate studies have also shown that
pomegranate constituents are reasonably bioavailable
shortly after ingestion, and chronic pomegranate supple-
mentation was shown to improve memory retention, and
verbal memory with increased functional brain activity
during visual and verbal memory tasks [66]. These
improvements were made with populations following
surgery or in middle-aged to older adults with mild
memory complaints and might provide a basis for future
research. Given the growing importance of the mainte-
nance and improvement of cognitive function, and the
positive association with cognitive effects shown in other
fruit and berry research, further studies with PE supple-
mentation
individuals
appear
warranted.
Finally, we can conclude that the consumption of PE (and
other polyphenol-rich supplements) has the potential to
limit neurodegeneration and prevent or reverse age-
dependent losses in cognitive performance. The keen
worldwide interest in the development of drugs capable of
enhancing brain function has led to speculation that
polyphenol-rich nutraceuticals may represent important
precursor molecules in the quest to maximize our
brainpower.

Glucosinolates are secondary metabolites found in the
Brassicaceae and related families of vegetables [1,2]. The
Brassicaceae orCruciferae familyincludesabout 3200species
of plants including Brassica oleracea (cabbage, cauliﬂower,
kale, broccoli, and brussel sprouts), Raphanus sativus
(radish), and others[1].Glucosinolates(GLNs)are madeupof
three
compartments:
b-thioglucose,
thiohydroximate-O-
sulfonate, and a variable aglycone side chain derived from
an a-amino acid which then classiﬁes the GLN as either
aliphatic, indole, or aromatic [1,2]. The composition, content,
and quantity of GLNs are different among plant genera,
and differ further based on environmental factors; over 200
GLNs have been identiﬁed in the literature. When plant
tissue is damaged, GLNs are hydrolyzed via enzyme myr-
osinase (b-thioglucoside glucohydrolase, thioglucosidase,
EC.3.2.1.147) to release a b-D-glucose and create an unstable
aglycone and thiohydroximate-O-sulfate. After reorganiza-
tion of the unstable intermediate, various metabolites are
formed depending on the original side chain of the GLN.
These metabolites are mainly formed into isothiocyanates
among other products [1,2]. GLNs and isothiocyanates have
been popular in recent years due to their beneﬁcial effects in
reducing the risk of carcinogenesis and other diseases in
humans [1,2].
One glucosinolate in particular called glucoraphanin, a
4-carbon aliphatic GLN, is prominently found in broccoli and
broccoli sprouts along with other B. oleracea vegetables [1].
Once masticated, glucoraphanin reacts with myrosinase or
gut microbes to form 4-methylsulﬁnylbutyl, an isothio-
cyanate commonly known as sulforaphane (SFA) [2e9]. It is
naturally found in the R-SFA form, which is more active than
its S-SFA isomer. A racemic mixture of the two enantiomers
can be used experimentally due to their fast interconversion,
and is hereby noted as SFA for simplicity [3e6]. SFA has
been proposed as a natural health product (NHP) that serves
as a neuroprotective agent for neurodegenerative diseases and
as an anticancer agent; it also holds beneﬁcial properties in
cardiac and retinal tissue, diabetes, microbiota, and other
aspects of human health [3,5,10].

Background and signiﬁcance
Our previous work has shown the potential for broccoli
sprouts (BrSps) and SFA as a protective agent in the
perinatal setting. A hypoxic-ischemic (HI) environment
in-utero, most often a result of placental insufﬁciency, is a
leading cause of perinatal brain damage to the fetus. It
results in a range of neurodevelopmental disabilities
including cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder,
attention deﬁcit hyperactive disorder, and epilepsy [11].
Placental insufﬁciency also leads to fetal growth restriction,
an additional risk factor for injury to the fetal brain. This
insult is the result of a chronic reduction in blood ﬂow to
the fetus, and thereby a deﬁciency of nutrient substrates in
the form of oxygen and glucose. As a result, energy
supplies are diminished, allowing for the production of
oxidative stress, and an inﬂammatory response which
ultimately leads to cell death of neurons, astrocytes, and
oligodendrocytes, depending on the time and duration of
injury during gestation. We have shown that bilateral
uterine artery ligation (BUAL) in pregnant dams mimics
placental insufﬁciency and results in intrauterine growth
restricted rat pups. Following BUAL, rat pups show both
white
matter
manifestations
reminiscent of cerebral palsy and other developmental
disabilities. BrSps (200 mg/day) provided as a dietary
supplement during the last week of gestation to the
pregnant dams who received BUAL prevented the patho-
logical damage and abnormal developmental behaviors
displayed by IUGR pups from dams who received BUAL,
but no BrSps. IUGR þ BrSps pups had denser myelination
shown by thicker white matter bundles and reduced astrocyte
reactivity indicating less white matter injury compared to
IUGR pups without a dietary supplement [11]. In addition to
these white matter changes, reminiscent of cerebral palsy,
hippocampal injury is also a hallmark of this injury. Once
again, BrSps supplementation during pregnancy, ameliorated
this injury. Hippocampal injury, important in epilepto-
genesis, memory, and cognitive function, is further evidence
of the preclinical relevance of this model in the develop-
mental disabilities, and the value of BrSps in the prevention
of these disorders by having a beneﬁcial inﬂuence on an
aberrant fetal environment (Fig. 11.1).
Another prominent risk factor that leads to an increased
likelihood of fetal brain injury is the fetal inﬂammatory
response (FIR), arising most often from a vertical maternal
infection such as chorioamnionitis. FIR targets premature
oligodendrocytes resulting in defects of myelin production
and organization, and blockage to oligodendroglial matura-
tion, leading to a hallmark of CP [12]. Late pregnancy
infection and inﬂammation leads to FIR and an enhanced
cytokine expression and oxidative stress. Using lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS)-induced inﬂammation at gestational day
(GD) 19 and 20, with BrSps supplementation starting at
GD 14, inﬂammation is reduced compared to no BrSps
supplementation in pups analyzed on day of birth. LPS
increased cytokines IL-1b and IL-10, while the addition of
BrSps reduced cytokine expression [12]. BrSps supple-
mentation in LPS pups also impacted the homeostasis of
popular antioxidant glutathione by increasing the ratio of
GSH/GSSG (reduced/oxidized glutathione) compared to

LPS only [12]. Moreover, analysis of early developmental
reﬂexes showed that the BrSps supplementation during the
last trimester of pregnancy prevented the developmental
dysfunction seen in those pups who remained untreated
(Table 11.1).
In our studies to determine the effect of SFA on
different brain cell types, pure cell cultures of either
neurons,
astrocytes,
oligodendroglia,
well
cocultures, have been established. Each cell culture was
exposed to concentrations of SFA from 0 (control) to
200 mm. In addition, after determining the LD50 of each
cell type exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
(LD50: duration of OGD required to ensure a cell death of
at least 50%), a dose-response curve was delineated to
determine both the effective dose for neuroprotection and a
possible toxic dose. Cortical brain cells of postnatal day 2
rat pups were used. We showed that SFA protects neurons,
astrocytes, and a combined culture of cells at low doses
(2.5 mM) when placed in an oxygen and glucose-deprived
(OGD) environment to mimic placental insufﬁciency. At
this low concentration, SFA was safe in all cell cultures
with and without OGD. However, at high concentrations
(25 mM), that are at least 10 times that of safe dosing
(Fig. 11.2), SFA proved to be consistently toxic in both
OGD and control cell cultures.
indicated
work
described
above,
summarized in the paragraphs below, SFA is a hormetic
compound; exhibiting a biphasic dose response. At a high
dose, SFA has a proapoptotic cell killing function and is
anticancerous. At low dose it is antiapoptotic, cell preserving,
and protective. This suggests that there may be a change in
mechanism between high and low doses of SFA.
Our laboratory has a keen interest in promoting SFA and
the cruciferous vegetables as a preventive agent to perinatal
brain injury. There is a clear hesitancy and perhaps fear of
treating pregnant mothers with any conventional pharma-
ceutical, stemming from the thalidomide crisis in the
late 1900s [13]. NHPs appear to be a relatively safe and
promising alternative for the prevention of fetal injury and
developmental disabilities. However, given the fact that the
fetus is a rapidly dividing organism (akin to cancer), and
the hormetic nature of SFA, it behoves us to have a better
understanding of its underlying mechanisms, so as to insure
its safe use during pregnancy, and appropriate use in
both diseases involving cell degeneration, and abnormal
proliferation. In this review, therefore, we explore and discuss
the paradox between SFA used as a protective/therapeutic
antiapoptotic agent and as a proapoptotic/anticancerous agent.
Antiapoptotic/maternal dietary supplement
Sulforaphane protection pathway (Nrf2/ARE)
SFA is commonly known as an indirect phase II enzyme
activator via the Nrf2/ARE pathway (Fig. 11.3) [8,14]. The
antioxidant response element (ARE) is responsible for
increasing antioxidative enzymes, such as glutathione-S-
transferase, heme oxygenase-1, and NAD(P) H:quinone
reductase 1 (NQO-1) [15,16]. These enzymes reduce
oxidative stress, an imbalance between oxidant production
and scavenging, by neutralizing reactive intermediates such
as reactive oxygen species, which lead to apoptosis [1,3,7].
Important in oxidant scavenging is the small molecule thiol
glutathione; the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to
oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a measure of oxidative

stress in a cell [7]. Activation of ARE is dependent on the
binding of the transcription factor, nuclear factor E2-related
factor (Nrf2) [3,7]. Nrf2 is normally suppressed in the
cytoplasm when bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated
protein 1 (Keap1) to prevent proteasomal degradation
[1,3,6,7,10,15,17]. An increase in GSSG/GSH levels, or
oxidative stress or an Nrf2 inducer can release Nrf2 from
Keap1 [15,16]. SFA acts as an alkylating agent and
oxidizes Keap1 by reacting with its cysteine group, in order
to release Nrf2 which can then migrate to the nucleus. In
the nucleus, Nrf2 forms transcriptionally active hetero-
dimers which bind and activate ARE at the promoter region
for phase II genes [1,3,5,7,8,16,18].
The Nrf2/ARE pathway is important for balancing
pro and antioxidant mechanisms for host protection and
infection elimination of both exogenous and endogenous
origins [14,19,20]. This pathway leads to an upregulation
of over 70 cytoprotective and antioxidant genes [21].
Indirect antioxidant activation by SFA is commonly seen in
antiapoptotic scenarios in tissues of the retina, kidney, liver,
heart, and brain [15]. Here we discuss scenarios in which
SFA is used as a therapeutic, speciﬁcally in maternal and
fetal health.
Placenta
To be used as a maternal dietary supplement for the
health of the fetus, the supplement or compound should
be able to cross the placental barrier. SFA does cross the
placenta. A study done by Park et al. shows the effect of
SFA as an Nrf2 inducer to diminish the negative effects
of exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)
during pregnancy. PBDE is a synthetic ﬂame retardant
used in a wide variety of materials including: building
materials, textiles, plastics, and others. Exposure to
PBDE results in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm
birth, low birth weight, or still birth. These outcomes are
also associated with an improper regulation of inﬂam-
matory

PBDE, BDE-47 (2,20,4,40-tetra-BDE), found in human
tissues and the environment. Since BDE-47 increases
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), they
further investigated intracellular concentrations of GSH.
GSH increased in a dose dependent manner upon HTR-8/
CVneo cell treatment with BDE-47 for 24 h (5, 10, 15,
20 mM). They also found that ARE activity was increased
in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with BDE-47
for 24 h.

(10, 20 mM); this indicated Nrf2 activation. In addition,
they saw an increase in the mRNA of GSH redox
cyclingerelated genes when cells were treated with 20 mM
of BDE-47. Scientists also explored the effect of SFA as an
Nrf2 inducer and its effect when cells were stimulated by
BDE-47. About 10 mM of SFA were shown to increase
ARE activity threefold when cells were treated with 20 mM
of BDE-47, compared to controls.
Perinatal brain injury
Sun et al. showed the neuroprotective effects of SFA in an
ischemic injury model of the central nervous system. Low
lead exposure of newborns during lactation can result in
learning and memory decline in children. A mechanism that
can cause this decline is that lead exposure can reduce the
production of radical scavenging enzymes, thereby resulting
in oxidative damage by accumulation of free radicals.
Pregnant dams were fed water containing lead until wean-
ing, and then via oral gavage, doses of SFA at 25 mg/kg/day
were given to pups for 4 weeks. They reported that SFA
improved the spatial learning and memory ability of rats
with cortical injury, attenuated the effect of oxidative stress,
and decreased blood lead levels in newborn pups compared
to pups that were not treated with SFA [22].
FASD
Fetal alcohol syndrome disorder (FASD) can be caused by
maternal consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Devel-
opmental and anatomical abnormalities include craniofacial
abnormalities, mental retardation, and behavioral and or

learning disabilities with life-long implications [8,9,23].
Excess ethanol (EtOH) concentrations predominantly occur
in the neural crest cell (NCC) population [8,9,23]. NCCs
originate between the neural plate and nonneural ectoderm
of the developing brain [9]. They are multipotent migratory
progenitor cells which differentiate into various brain cell
types: neurons, glial, melanocytes, endocrine, craniofacial
cartilage, bone, and other connective tissues [8,9].
Prior to differentiation, the NCCs migrate away from
their original location at the neural plate border via a
delamination process. This process includes an epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT). The NCCs detach from
an epithelial layer and transition into mesenchymal cells
which have an increased migratory and invasive property,
along with apoptotic resistance. The EMT process is
promoted by transcription factor Snail1, by repressing
E-cadherin, an EMT suppressor. Snail is repressed by a
triple methyl modiﬁcation on the 27th lysine of histone H3
(H3K27me3). This modiﬁcation is associated with neuro-
developmental disorders. Li et al. reported that SFA
showed antiapoptotic effects through upregulating Nrf2 in
NCCs.
They
EtOH
(50 mM)-induced
apoptosis of NCCs was prevented when treated with
concentrations as low as 1 mM of SFA. EtOH exposure
caused an increase in E-cadherin thereby suppressing EMT,

gene, and a reduction in histone acetylation at the promoter
region of antiapoptotic gene, Bcl2. SFA treatment restored

Snail1 and restoring EMT [9].
Yuan and colleagues also investigated the effect of SFA
on Nrf2 and epigenetic regulation in relation to FASD.
Histone acetylation is regulated by histone deacylatase
(HDAC) and histone acetyl transferase (HAT). They
reported that 1 mM of SFA (pre and concurrent treatment
with EtOH) prevents EtOH-induced apoptosis in NCCs.
SFA inhibits and thus decreases the HDAC activity that is
increased by EtOH in NCCs. Through this inhibition, SFA
also increases acetylated levels of histone H3 which are
decreased by EtOH. EtOH promotes HDACs, which lead to
deacetylation at the Bcl-2 promoter region. SFA attenuates
this action, thereby increasing the binding of acetyl-histone
3 to Bcl-2. EtOH was also shown to decrease Bcl-2 mRNA
and protein expression while SFA diminished this effect.
The same study also reported the effect of SFA in mouse
embryos.
Pregnant

injections of 40 mg/kg of SFA, followed by two i.p. doses
of 1.9 mg/kg of EtOH. EtOH exposure increased the
apoptosis marker caspase-3, while SFA treatment reduced
this activation in EtOH exposed mouse embryos [23].
Oxidative stress also plays an important role in EtOH-
apoptosis.

SFA
diminished EtOH-induced superoxide anion generation,
cell death, and the incidence of neural tube defects, in
NCCs and in mouse embryos exposed to EtOH and

for 24 h in vitro increased the expression of Nrf2 and its
downstream
enzymes.
When
Nrf2
suppressed by siRNA in NCCs, there was an accumulation
of ROS which led to apoptosis. SFA treatment (1 mM)
increased Nrf2 protein expression, ARE promoter activity,
and downstream antioxidant enzymes including superoxide
dismutase 1 and catalase. Therefore, SFA was able to
reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis in NCCs at a low
dose [8].
Lung
Acute respiratory failure in neonates can be improved by
exposure to hyperoxia. However, this can also lead to
alveolar growth impairment during postnatal lung devel-
opment, resulting in structure and function changes in the
later mature lung. Hyperoxia treatment is also a risk factor
for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a
chronic lung disease that often affects premature newborns.
McGrath-Morrow et al. showed that hyperoxic exposure in
mice leads to alveolar growth and lung inﬂammation
similar to that in BPD. When mice were given a null
mutation of the Nrf2 gene, lung inﬂammation was

decreased. McGrath-Morrow et al. tested to see if SFA
would attenuate hyperoxic growth inhibition in the neonatal
lung via inducing Nrf2. They found that in utero, SFA
exposure decreased inﬂammation shown by attenuating
proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-6 expression in the neonatal
lung of mice, although it did not mitigate alveolar growth
abnormality. This data suggested that SFA as an inducer of
Nrf2 could potentially be used as a therapy in preventing or
reducing the severity of BPD [24].
Malaria
Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is a severe form of
malaria infection which has an effect on both the mother
and infant. It is an infection which leads to the recruitment
of monocytes and macrophages to the placenta due to the
accumulation of the parasite, plasmodium falciparum, in
erythrocyte cells. CD36 is a membrane glycoprotein
located on both monocytes and macrophages. It acts as a
receptor to protect the host cell against inﬂammation
through processes of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and
other pathogens. During the malaria blood stage of infec-
tion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced when
hemoglobin is metabolized by p. falciparum. This rise in
activates

proliferator-activated receptor gamma and Nrf2, both of
which transcriptionally control CD36 expression. Nrf2 is
involved in controlling CD36 mediated phagocytosis in in-
ﬂammatory conditions via regulating the expression of the
antioxidant gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which detoxiﬁes
free heme during malaria infection by catabolizing it into
biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide, among others.
Aubouy et al. studied the expression of CD36 and HO-1
by monocytes and their role in clinical outcomes of PAM in
a population of patients from Benine, West Africa. Pregnant
women infected with malaria at delivery were recruited, and
were assessed based on the birth weight of their infants, low
(LBW) or high (HBW). This study reported a relationship
between Nrf2, HO-1, and CD36 mRNA levels of maternal
monocytes in low parasite density and high infant birth
weight. Upon treating the maternal monocytes with 1 mM
SFA, there was a signiﬁcant increase in CD36 transcript
levels in mothers with LBW children which became equal to
levels in mothers with HBW children, suggesting that the
Nrf2 pathway in mothers with LBW children is not
compromised, but lacks sufﬁcient stimuli. Aubouy et al. also
reported a positive transcriptional correlation between
CD36, HO-1, Nrf2, and antiinﬂammatory markers IL-10 and
CD163 [19]. The data suggests that SFA can be used as an
inducer for Nrf2 in mothers with LBW children to reduce
severity during PAM.
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental health dis-
order which occurs in young adults [20]. In 2019, the
World Health Organization reported that over 21 million
people worldwide are affected by this disorder [14]. A main
symptom of schizophrenia is cognitive impairment which
can be detected before onset, at childhood and adolescent
stages [14,20]. Addressing cognitive impairment early on
can prevent the conversion to psychosis and possibly the
onset of schizophrenia. Studies have shown that inﬂam-
mation is linked to psychosis; Hashimoto et al. comments
positron
emission
tomography
demonstrated
microglial activation in patients with schizophrenia and
others with high risk for psychosis. They also mention
epidemiology studies which show an increased risk of
neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring as a result of
maternal infection during pregnancy [14]. A stimuli, such
as inﬂammation (microglial activation) or infection, can
result in maternal immune activation (MIA). MIA can
cause abnormal gene expression, and increase in oxidative
stress and inﬂammation in offspring, leading to possible
cognitive impairments and then psychosis. However, a
dietary intake of glucoraphanin during juvenile stage and
adolescence can treat or prevent cognitive impairments.
Hashimoto et al. created an MIA rodent model by using
double-stranded
RNA
analogue
polyriboinosinic-
polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), which is a tolllike
receptor 3 agonist [14,20]. When injected with poly(I:C)
prenatally, offsprings are born with schizophrenialike
behavioral abnormalities and cognitive deﬁcits along with
decreased parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in the
medial
prefrontal
cortex
[14,20].
Another
schizophrenia is a phencyclidine (PCP)-induced model.
PCP is a calcium ion channel blocker; when administered
repetitively it reduces PV immunoreactivity in the medial
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and also leads to
cognitive deﬁcits [14]. Dietary intake of GRA during
juvenile and adolescence attenuates the decrease in PV
immunoreactivity, increase in inﬂammation, and cognitive
impairments by converting to SFA, and then possibly
interacting in the Nrf2/ARE pathway and decreasing
oxidative stress. Nrf2 and KEAP1 proteins were found to
be decreased in schizophrenia patients compared to control
patients, suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia.
Developmental origins of health in adult
Fetal programming of adult health is a concept of disease
prevention that starts with therapies during in-utero devel-
opment. Several studies have shown that adverse outcomes
during development, such as intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR), increases the chance of having an adult disease
such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis,
stroke, and cancer. Oxidative stress (OS), inﬂammation,
and maternal hypertension are risk factors that contribute to
aberrant placenta signaling and negative fetal program-
ming, and are associated with many of these disorders.
Noyan-Ashraf et al. showed that supplementation of dietary
compounds would promote endogenous antioxidants, and
ameliorate these risk factors. They used a spontaneous
hypertensive stroke prone (SHRsp) rat model, which
exhibited severe hypertension, as well as OS and inﬂam-
mation. The effects of air-dried BrSps consumption were
tested on the SHRsp rat model. Both male and female adult
rats were fed a regular diet plus BrSps (Grnþ) or only the
regular diet (Grn). This study showed that female SHRsp
rats fed a Grnþ diet resulted in higher GSH:GSSG ratios
compared to Grnfed rats, by almost twofold in carotid
artery, aorta, heart, and kidney tissues.
From the Grnþ-fed female population, some of them
were allowed to get pregnant and their offspring were fed
either a Grnþ or Grn diet. Grn offspring showed the
same blood pressure as moms with a Grnþ diet, which was
a lower blood pressure, closer to, but above normal,
compared to Grn moms. Grnþ offspring showed an even
lower blood pressure than Grn offspring, though still
above normal. This showed that the beneﬁcial effects of
BrSps supplementation can pass through the placenta, and
that the effects are attributed in both adults and young
offspring. The Grnþ fed dams also showed a signiﬁcant

## Page 177

decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein
in the kidney, and activated microglia in the brain,
compared to Grn fed dams. This study suggests that a
BrSps supplemented diet resulted in less oxidant stress and
greater oxidant scavenging capacity in adult females,
pregnant females, and their offspring, when experiencing a
greater than normal OS. Therefore, dietary supplementation
during pregnancy clearly impacts the health of the adult
offspring [7].
Proapoptotic/anticancer
As mentioned earlier, signiﬁcant evidence is present for the
neuroprotective effect of SFA, which requires antiapoptotic
and antinecrotic activity. However, surprisingly in cancer
cells SFA has been shown to promote apoptosis. In our
own laboratory, we became interested in the diverse
contributions of glucosinolates to both cell protection and
cell death, particularly given our original work during
pregnancy and fetal protection. The fetus is clearly an
organism that is rapidly growing, and therefore cells are
multiplying, much the same as cancer. Clearly, in fetus this
is a normal process, and there are genetic mechanisms by
which proliferation is turned off. Nonetheless, if we are to
move the ﬁeld of fetal protection forward using glucosi-
nolates, we need to ﬁnd out how these metabolites work to
both protect normal cells and also kill cancer cells. As such,
we have started to look at human glioblastoma cell lines, as
one of the more resistant and fatal forms of cancer.
Glioblastoma in children is a deadly form of cancer,
with an overall survival rate in its most extreme form only
2% after 5 years, and resistant to current forms of surgery,
radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. We cultured glioblastoma
cells and tested their survivability against a spectrum of
sulforaphane concentrations (Fig. 11.4). Interestingly, our
data
indicated
concentrations of SFA shown in our astrocyte cell cultures,
10X the concentration is required to cause glioblastoma cell
death. This indicates the hermetic, or biphasic, activity of
SFA and is one of the reasons for its bidirectional effects. In
further preliminary studies (which require veriﬁcation) we
have also shown evidence of SFAs contributions to the
promotion of p-53, a tumor suppressor gene that may
contribute to the mechanism of glucosinolates in our
glioblastoma cell lines (Fig. 11.4).
Questions need to be addressed about the contradictory
effects of SFA in normal cells versus cancer cells. Thus,
several studies were conducted to investigate the mecha-
nisms of SFA anticancer activity and determine the dosage
needed to promote such an effect. It appears that the
mechanisms at the forefront of SFA protective mechanism
are signiﬁcantly different than those utilized when SFA is
active as an anticancer agent. Here we demonstrate those
mechanisms brieﬂy with highlighting some of the doses
used to promote those mechanisms in different cancer
types.
Reactive oxidant species generation
One of the widely observed mechanisms in promoting
anticancer activity is the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) which are chemically reactive groups that
contain oxygen such as peroxides and superoxides. ROS
act as signaling molecules in normal healthy cells, and are
found to be elevated in almost all cancers due to the high
metabolic activity of cancer cells [25]. This elevation leads
to an intracellular toxic environment, causing cancer cells
to have an increased expression of antioxidant proteins, as
well to counteract the oxidative stress. Hence, a compound
that is able to elevate the ROS in cancer cells to the extent
that exceeds the capacity of antioxidant proteins will induce
apoptosis and therefore present anticancer properties.

200 mM. This indicates that SFA can be effective in killing cancer cells, while much higher doses are required to kill normal cells. In this regard,
signiﬁcant glioblastoma cell death began to occur at concentrations of 30 mM or greater (*P < .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001).

In human urinary bladder cancer, T24 cell line, ROS
production was reported to be an early event upon addition
of SFA. This ROS production increased the Bax/Bcl-2
ratio, and promoted the translocation of Bax from cytosol
to mitochondria, initiating a cascade of events that resulted
activating
caspases,
hence
eventually
promoting
apoptosis [26]. Elevation in ROS was also observed with
the treatment of p-53 deﬁcient colon cancer cells with SFA
at concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mM, leading to the
promotion of apoptosis. With further investigation, the
researchers suspected that an elevation in the p53 family
member, p73, was a main contributor to the apoptotic
activity in the colon cancer cells. However, no upregulation
was found, which led them to. pretreat the cells with ROS,
p38, and Erk inhibitors, individually, prior to treatment
with SFA. The inhibition completely or partially limited the
apoptotic effect of SFA, determined by cell viability tests.
This suggested that the ROS role in promoting apoptosis
is mediated by activation of p-Erk and p-p38, and
independent from p53 and p73 [27].
In the leukemia cell line, HL-60, SFA was reported to
increase ROS and calcium production, activating the
oxidative stress-mitochondria pathway that resulted in
triggering apoptosis [28].
Wang et al. found that following treatment with SFA,
thyroid cancer cells were arrested in G2/M phase of cell
cycle, in addition to an upregulation of p21. This cell cycle
arrest and p21 induction was reversed by the addition of
ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine. Both of these observa-
tions led to the conclusion that SFA caused G2/M phase
arrest by an ROS-dependent pathway and increased the
expression of p21 in these cells. Also, by enhancing ROS
generation, SFA caused the stimulation of caspase-3 and 9
in thyroid cancer cells leading to cell apoptosis [29].The
association between SFA and ROS elevation found in
different cancer types is promising in triggering apoptosis
independently from loss of function mutations.
Signaling apoptosis through the
extrinsic pathway
As mentioned earlier, the ROS elevation caused by SFA
activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as apoptosis is
mediated by the change of mitochondrial membrane
potential and the release of cytochrome C.
In addition to intrinsic apoptosis pathways activated
through ROS elevation, extrinsic apoptosis signaling was
also found to be involved in different cancer types. This is
surprising as apoptosis is mediated by the change of
mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of
cytochrome C. Apoptosis has been activated through
upregulation of death receptors rather than a process that
happens intracellularly. For instance, SFA upregulated the
expression of Fas death receptor and its transmembrane
protein ligand (Fas-Ligand), in HL-60 cells [28]. This
extrinsic apoptosis signaling was also found in bladder
cancer cell lines; SFA treatment sensitized cells to TRAIL
(death receptor 5) mediated apoptosis [30].
Redox signaling
Redox signaling is a pathway used by cells in which the
happens
electron
transfer
reactions
between molecules that include proteins, ions, and free
radicals. A redox reaction consists of oxidation (loss of
electrons or increased oxidative charge) and reduction (gain
of electrons or decreased oxidative charge) of molecules.
Recently, it has been reported in leukemia cells that Aqua-
porin protein 8 (AQP8) is capable of modulating H2O2
transport through the cell membrane [31]. AQP8 is called a
water channel protein, as it functions as a water transporter
through cell membrane. NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is a
member of a membrane-associated enzymatic complex
family, which functions as an electron transporter through
membranes. It oxidizes NADPH and transfers the electrons
to molecular oxygen, creating hydrogen peroxide [32]. In
leukemia cells, this hydrogen peroxide is transported
through AQP8 water channel to inside the cell, and functions
as a signaling molecule. Adding SFA in concentrations of
10 and 30 mM has exerted cytotoxic activity on B1647
leukemia cell line cultures through downregulation of AQP8
and Nox2 expression, which decreases the production and
entry of H2O2. Disrupting this redox signaling pathway in
the cell eventually led to detrimental effects on both cell
survival and proliferation [33].
Effect on HDAC enzymes
One of the hallmarks of cancer is the epigenetic alterations
in cancer cells that lead to changes in gene expression and
results in uncontrolled cell growth [34]. A major epigenetic
mechanism in the control of gene expression is the change
in histone acetylation and deacetylation status. This change
is controlled by two classes of enzymes, histone acetyl
transferase (HAT), which adds an acetyl group on the
lysine
residues
histones,
deacetylase
(HDAC) which removes the acetyl groups from the histones.
Adding acetyl groups increases the negative charge on
histones, which creates a repulsion force with DNA wrapped
around histones, hence rendering the chromatin more
permissive to transcription factors for controlling gene
expression. These epigenetic changes in cancer cells lead to
the activation of oncogenic genes and the silencing of tumor
suppressor genes. Therefore, HDAC inhibitors were reported
to have an anticancer effect in many cancers, with different
mechanisms, such as activating tumor suppressor genes and
suppressing oncogenes. SFA was ﬁrst reported to be a strong
HDAC inhibitor in colorectal cancer [35]. In triple negative


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 179

breast cancer cell lines (Absence of estrogen, progesterone,
or excess HER2 receptors, and therefore cannot be treated
with hormonal therapy), SFA treatment inhibited HDAC6.
Normally HDAC6 would inhibit the membrane localization
of PTEN protein, leading to increased phosphorylation of
AKT, which increases the survival of the cell. Thus,
inhibition of this pathway by SFA treatment would induce
autophagy, and eventually cell death. This was evident by
decreased p62, increased Beclin1 protein expression, and
increased production of LC3-II, all signs of increased
autophagy that leads to cell death [36]. Similarly, in a study
conducted by Kim et al., SFA treatment led to a signiﬁcant
increase in the expression of acetylated histone H3 in
vestibular schwannoma cells, again leading to enhanced
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, consistent with HDAC
inhibition [37].
ERK pathway
The MAPK/ERK pathway is a series of proteins in the cell
which transfer a signal from a receptor on the cell surface to
the DNA. This same pathway was found to be activated in
glioblastoma cell lines by SFA metabolite SFA N-acetyl
cysteine (SFA-NAC), and led to the activation of exces-
sive autophagy that resulted in the disruption of a-tubulin
and eventually autophagic cell death. Using the ERK
inhibitor PD98059 reversed the effect of SFANAC [38].
Similar results were found by Zhou et al. in prostate cancer
cell lines. They have demonstrated that SFA metabolites
led to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 which affected the
downstream effectors, resulting in microtubule disruption
and apoptosis [39]. Another study showed that SFA
stimulated the same pathway in nonsmall cell lung cancer,
and found that not only did SFA stimulate ERK1/2, but
also 26S proteasome (a molecular machine that degrades
proteins) level was increased after the treatment of NSCLC
cells with SFA. Again, the inhibition of ERK1/2 by
PD98059 reversed the activation of 26S proteasome [40].
Activation of tumor suppressor genes:
p53, p21, p27, and p73
P53, p21, p27, and p73 are tumor suppressor genes, as they
can promote cell cycle arrest and some of them can promote
apoptosis as well. Hence, an anticancer activity can be
mediated through the activation of these genes. In ovarian
cancer cells, SFA activated P53 and P27 and downregulated
cyclin-D1 and cMyc expression (oncogenes). These factors
led to the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells [41]. In addition,
p73 protein expression was upregulated and was accompa-
nied by the elevation of Bax (an apoptotic protein). This
elevation of p73 resulted in the translocation of Bax to the
mitochondria, activating the intrinsic apoptotic signaling
pathway, leading to apoptosis of lung cancer Xuanwei
cells [42]. In breast cancer MCF-7 cell line, p53 and p21
levels were elevated, leading to the SFA-mediated G2/M
cell cycle arrest [43].
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
In hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, the ER stress
pathway is involved in SFA mediated apoptosis. This was
evident by the upregulation of Bip/GRP78 and XBP-1
(markers of ER stress response) [44]. In this cell line and
others, SFA increased the expression of GRP78 and CHO,
which indicates that the ER stress pathway was also
involved in SFA-mediated apoptosis [26].
The effect on cancer stem cells
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a central role in cancer
development. For the maintenance of these cells, the
canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway was found to be critical.
This pathway is negatively regulated by GSK3b, and this
gene itself can be downregulated by the oncogenic miR19-a
and miR19-b. When upregulated, those micro RNAs
downregulate GSK3b gene expression, which attenuates
the negative modulation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway,
eventually resulting in maintaining the stemness of the lung
cancer cells. Here, SFA was found to exert an anticancer
activity by targeting the miR-19a and miR-19b restoring
the regulatory mechanisms in these cells.
In melanoma, CSCs promote tumor survival through
enhanced cell invasion and migration. These qualities were
associated with increased Ezh2 stem cell survival protein
expression. Inhibition of this protein reduced the migration,
invasion, and spheroid formation of these cells. When
subjected to SFA treatment, the ability of cell spheroid
formation were limited [45].
The effect of SFA was also observed on prostate cancer
stem cells, where SFA downregulated c-Myc protein
expression in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP cell lines and
androgen-independent PC-3 and C4-2 human prostate
cancer cell lines. In PC-3 cells, the SFA-induced down-
regulation of c-Myc was transient, whereas in LNCaP and
C4-2 cells, the effect was sustained for at least 24 h
following treatment. This downregulation of c-Myc was
observed to inhibit the prostate cancer stem cell traits [46].
The effect on SMYD3 genes
SMYD3 is a protein that belongs to a family of lysine
methylases. These proteins are responsible for the methyl-
ation of various histone and nonhistone proteins. SMYD3
is responsible for the methylation of some nonhistone
proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
1 (VEGFR1), involved in the cancer cell survival and
proliferation [47]. In gastric cancer cells, SFA signiﬁcantly

limits the levels of mRNA of SMYD3 and leads to
apoptosis. The overexpression of SMYD3 could inhibit the
apoptotic and antiproliferation effect of SFA, which
indicates that SMYD3 is also a target of SFA in gastric
cancer, mediating the apoptotic effect [48].

treated T24 cells. Nrf2 stimulation resulted in apoptosis

resistance. This effect was speciﬁc to the transformed cells
only, while in nontransformed cells SFA upregulated
inducible Nrf2 leading to a protective effect against ROS
generated by cadmium [49].
AMPK and SFA toxicity and protection
Another pathway to consider with regard to SFA-induced
toxicity and protection is the adenosine monophosphate-
activated
(AMPK)
pathway.
AMPK
governs homeostasis and energy metabolism of immune
cell functions including cytotoxicity and apoptosis. AMPK
activation is reﬂected by phosphorylation of the a-subunit
which depends on an increase in AMP/ATP ratio [50e54].
Many studies have shown a relationship between the
activation of AMPK in the presence of SFA, and induction
of apoptosis. Chen et al. used SFA as an inhibitor of
proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, as it reduced
migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. In a
hypoglycemic environment, AMPK activation was reduced
in the cancer cells, but with the addition of SFA, the
pathway was activated. Hypoglycemia was also linked to a
decrease in the nuclear localization of Nrf2, and this was
also attenuated with SFA. Chen et al. showed that
pretreating pancreatic cancer cells with an AMPK signaling
inhibitor
suppressed
SFA-induced
AMPK
phosphorylation and increased expression of nuclear NrF2.
This study suggests that Nrf2 may be a downstream target
of AMPK [50]. Other studies have also shown a connection
between AMPK and SFA in a protective setting. Prion
protein diseases are neurodegenerative and Lee et al.
showed how SFA can contribute toward protecting neuronal
cells from prion proteineinduced apoptosis. SFA increases
AMPK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in
neuronal cells. When an AMPK inhibitor is present, SFA’s
neuroprotective effect was blocked, but AMPK was still
able to be activated in the presence of another activator,
conﬁrming that the neuroprotective effect by SFA is
governed my AMPK activation. Lee et al. stated that when
cells are pretreated with SFA, autophagy is induced to
protect the cells, and this is regulated by AMPK [53].
The glucosinolates are important metabolites within the
family of cruciferous vegetables. Evolutionarily, these
substances serve to protect the plants during the early days
of their growth, given their pungent odor and higher
concentrations
sprouts
mature
vegetable. Upon ingesting the sprouts, glucoraphanin
mixes with the endogenous enzyme myrosinase to form
SFA, the active chemical as both a cell protectant and cell
killer. This paradoxical beneﬁt, particularly in neurologic
disorders and cancer, is both promising but also serves to
caution us with respect to utilization. The literature clearly
indicates huge potential for the use of the glucosinolates
and SFA across a spectrum of disease. The underlying
mechanisms vary with the type of disease, being apoptotic
and the induction of genes in the case of cancer relief, and
through the NrF2 pathway and antioxidant through ARE
and the central glutathione pathway, as an antioxidant.
The importance of understanding the mechanisms of each
of these bidirectional pathways is evident. Moreover,
delineating the range of concentrations required for each
of these functions is extremely important, particularly in
view of the potential age spectrum that treatment may be
applied to. And, at least in our laboratory experiments,
there is a clear distinction between the effects of low
concentrations of SFA compared to high concentrations.
Clearly, the value of natural health products, particularly
glucosinolates,
needs
ongoing
exploration,
scientiﬁc
evidence, and acceptance by the scientiﬁc and medical
community.

Application of other polyphenolic compounds in human central
nervous system functions
Polyphenols are a wide group of plant secondary metabo-
lites, which give to plants growth, pigmentation, pollination,
and resistance against environmental stress, pathogens, and
predators [1]. With their chemical structure, polyphenols are
generically characterized by the presence of one or more
hydroxyl groups linked to a benzene ring and can be
classiﬁed as ﬂavonoids and nonﬂavonoids, as shown in
Fig. 12.1. Flavonoids are a group of polyphenolic com-
pounds with a common structure (two benzene rings linked
through a linear three-carbon chain, forming an oxygenated
heterocycle, C6eC3eC6) and can be subdivided into
various subgroups, including ﬂavonols, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂa-
vones, isoﬂavones, ﬂavanones, and anthocyanidins [1,2].
The nonﬂavonoid group includes structurally different
compounds, such as phenolic acids (C6eC1), stilbenes
(C6eC2eC6), and lignans (C6eC3eC3eC6) [3]. In
nature, polyphenols are commonly linked to sugars, such as
glucose or rhamnose, through one or more hydroxyl groups,
and are generally referred to as glycosylated compounds
[4,5]. When not attached to sugars, polyphenols are referred
to as being in their aglycone form [5]. More than 8000
polyphenols have so far been identiﬁed [6e8]. These com-
pounds are highly abundant in human diet, including in
fruits, vegetables, cereals, and beverages, such as tea, coffee,
and wine [6,8,9].
Polyphenols are in fact endowed with antioxidant
[10,11] and antiinﬂammatory properties [6,12] that include
the inhibition of proinﬂammatory enzymes and signaling
(i.e.,
nuclear
factor-kappa
B
(NF-kB)
cascade), the modulation of several cell survival/cell-cycle
genes [13e17], the activation of antiaging enzymes like
sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [18,19], and the regulation of develop-
mental pathways (like Wnt/b-catenin) involved in the
process of adult neurogenesis [20]. The activation of de-
fense systems and the modulation of the signaling pathways
cited above are part of a multidimensional network program
known to affect adult neurogenesis in mammals in the
stages of adulthood, especially during aging [21,22].
Natural polyphenols have been shown to have potent
antioxidant activity, since they can inhibit the generation of
free radicals by deactivating their active species and/or
precursors. They also act as radical scavengers in the lipid
peroxidation chain reactions, donating an electron to the
free radical [23,24]. The role of polyphenolic compounds in
promoting the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as
glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase,
has been widely reported [23]. In addition to their antiox-
idant properties, most of the polyphenolic compounds show
a modulatory activity in several cell signaling pathways
associated with survival, cell growth, proliferation, differ-
entiation, and apoptosis [23,25].

Dietary polyphenols play important roles in human
health. It is widely shown that high intake of fruits,
vegetables, and cereals, which are rich in polyphenolic
molecules, has been related to lowered risks of chronic
disorders [23,24]. Among the numerous dietary poly-
phenols,
curcumin,
resveratrol,
epigallocatechin
gallate (EGCG) have greatly demonstrated their neuro-
protective effects.
Neuroprotective effects of curcumin
An intriguing study conducted by Mansouri et al. investi-
gated
intraperitoneally
administrated
homocysteine-induced
neuronal toxicity in a rat model of PD. The results
showed that homocysteine had neurotoxic effects on dopa-
minergic neurons in substantia nigra and that curcumin
treatment mitigated behavior symptoms and reduced the
apoptosis rate [26]. Similar results have also been achieved
in a Drosophila melanogaster model of HD. Here, the au-
thors
evidenced that
alleviates neuronal motor dysfunction by suppressing cell
death [27]. The effectiveness of curcumin administration in
counteracting cognitive decline in a rat model of sporadic
dementia of AD type has been demonstrated by Ishrat and
colleagues. These authors observed a signiﬁcant improve-
ment of cognitive deﬁcits as well as a decrease of gluta-
thione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase, and reduced
glutathione (GSH) levels in the hippocampus and cerebral
cortex, and an increase in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)
activity in the hippocampus of treated rats [28]. In certain
cases, polyphenols might be effective only as adjunctive
therapy. For instance, neuropathology in AD patients is
related to defective clearance of Ab by the innate immune
system. Immune stimulation in AD patients by 1-alpha,
25(OH)2-vitamin D3(1,25D3) in combination with curcu-
minoids concluded that vitamin D3 interacts with curcu-
minoids to stimulate Ab clearance by macrophages [29].
These data suggest that curcuminoids have additive effects
on the phagocytosis and could be beneﬁcial for AD
immunoprophylaxis [30].
Neuroprotective effects of resveratrol
Data from a study conducted in a mouse model of HD
showed that resveratrol treatment signiﬁcantly ameliorated
motor
coordination
enhanced
expression levels of mitochondrial-encoded electron trans-
port chain genes [31]. The role of resveratrol in protecting
the brain from Ab-induced toxicity in a rat model of AD

has also been observed. In this study, researchers demon-
strated that neuroprotective effects of resveratrol were
associated with a reduction in inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) levels and lipid peroxidation and an
increase in the production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
[32].
Similar
Kar-
uppagounder and collaborators, who showed the ability of
resveratrol to diminish plaque formation in a brain-speciﬁc
region in a mouse model of AD. This beneﬁcial effect on
Ab was associated with decreased brain glutathione and an
increase of its precursor product cysteine [33]. Witte and
colleagues tested whether supplementation of resveratrol
would enhance memory performance in older adults and
addressed the underlying mechanisms [34]. Resveratrol
intake (200 mg/d) for 26 weeks signiﬁcantly improved
memory performance in the subjects compared with
placebo, along with signiﬁcant increases in hippocampal
functional connectivity and improved glucose metabolism
indicating potential strategies to maintain brain health
during aging [34]. The study by Turner et al. [35] found
that resveratrol was well tolerated by participants and did
alter some AD biomarkers in individuals with mild to
moderate AD, compared with the placebo group.
Neuroprotective effects of EGCG
isolated from green tea
Xu et al. evaluated the neurorescue effect of EGCG against
neurodegeneration in a mouse of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD. EGCG
rescued MPTP-induced neurotoxicity by reducing oxida-
tive stress and regulating the iron-export protein ferroportin
in substantia nigra [36]. By using an AD mouse model, He
and colleagues demonstrated the protective effect of EGCG
on neurodegeneration by decreasing the expression of the
amyloid precursor protein and Ab in the hippocampus of
affected mice [37]. The effects of EGCG on neuro-
inﬂammation and amyloidogenesis in the mice model of
AD have also been tested. The study showed that EGCG
prevented
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and apoptosis of neuronal cells
and increased the expression of the tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-a), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1b), and interleukin 6
(IL-6) [38].
Similarly, EGCG signiﬁcantly reversed the cognitive
deﬁcits in Down syndrome patients with effects on memory
recognition, working memory, and quality of life. EGCG
treatment also induced signiﬁcant changes in plasma
homocysteine levels [39]. Similarly, EGCG signiﬁcantly
increased the overall EEG activity in different brain regions
of human subjects compared to placebo [40] and increased
self-rated calmness and reduced self-rated stress. These
data also indicate that the subjects may be in a more relaxed
and attentive state after consuming EGCG, thus supporting
the relaxing and refreshing properties of green tea. The
studies showed positive correlation of green tea poly-
phenols with improved performance on cognitive tests and
increased antioxidant capacity of plasma in patients with
AD or cognitive dysfunction, compared with the placebo
groups [41,42].
Application of other polyphenolic
compounds in human central nervous
system functions
Natural extracts rich in dietary polyphenols could have
beneﬁcial central nervous system effects in normal human
subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric diseases, in
terms of memory, cognition, and other brain functions.
Concord grape juice (containing polyphenols, including
anthocyanins and ﬂavanols) was administered to human
subjects with mild cognitive impairment for 16 weeks
followed by assessment of memory function and brain
activation. The study concluded that participants who
consumed grape juice compared to placebo showed
improved cognitive function and relatively greater brain
activation [43]. To assess long-term effects, Kesse-Guyot
and colleagues investigated if total and class-speciﬁc
polyphenol intake in midlife are associated with cognitive
performance in human subjects measured 13 years later.
Assessment of cognitive performance in 2574 middle-aged
adults indicated that intake of catechins, aﬂavins, ﬂavonols,
and hydroxybenzoic acids was positively associated with
language and verbal memory, especially with episodic
memory. These data suggest that high intake of speciﬁc
polyphenols, including ﬂavonoids and phenolic acids, may
help in long-term preservation of verbal memory [44]. A
related clinical study aimed to investigate the effect of
polyphenolic compounds isolated from red wine on human
higher brain functions indicated that the compounds were
able to positively affect the spatial memory [45].
The trials assessing fortiﬁed fruit juice consumption
reported a positive association with improved cognitive
performance compared with the placebo groups, specif-
ically, improved executive function, psychomotor speed,
verbal ﬂuency, short-term and long-term memory, and
associate learning [46e48]. Yimam et al. [49] also reported
an increase in speed and accuracy of processing complex
information, compared with the placebo group. Henderson
et al. [50] assessed isoﬂavones in health of postmenopausal
women, and they found in secondary analyses a greater
improvement on visual memory in the isoﬂavone group
compared with the placebo group. Downey et al. [51] found
improved cognitive performance in a sample of healthy
adults taking 320 or 640 mg of Bacopa monnieri, compared
with the placebo group. Devore et al. [52] reported that

greater intake of ﬂavonoids was positively correlated with
slower rates of cognitive decline. Similarly, Root et al. [53]
reported that ﬂavonol intake was associated with preserved
cognitive function.
Dietary polyphenols are increasingly predicted as a novel
and a relevant strategy in the prevention and treatment of
neurological disorders. This is explained not only by their
ability to reduce neuroinﬂammation and to improve mem-
ory and cognitive function. In addition to their antioxidant
properties, most of the polyphenolic compounds show a
modulatory activity in several cell signaling pathways
associated with survival, cell growth, proliferation, differ-
entiation, and apoptosis.

Prebiotics and probiotics
The connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota,
and mental health is very interesting. In the recent past it
has been gaining lot of interest [1]. The effect of gut
microbiota on the brain was seldom recognized by people
until the year 2000 when a public health emergency
aroused people’s attention to the possible relationship be-
tween the gut microbiota and the brain. During this year,
the ﬂood occurred in the town of Walkerton, Canada,
polluting the drinking water with Escherichia coli and
Campylobacter jejuni. Out of the 4561 infected people,
2451 of them completed a reassessment 8 years later, and
1166 of them were diagnosed with irritable bowel syn-
drome (IBS). Among these IBS patients, anxiety and
depression were found to be independent risk factors for
continuous IBS. Later in the year 2011, a study by Diaz
Heijtz et al. showed that compared with conventional mice
who were growing in speciﬁc-pathogen-free (SPF) envi-
ronment, germ-free (GF) mice under the experimental
conditions had less anxietylike behaviors and increased 5-
HT synthesis in the thalamus [5,49]. On shifting the adult
GF mice to an SPF environment, its reduced anxietylike
behavior did not increase, but its offspring’s anxiety
behavior returned to the normal state, which indicated that
there was a critical time window for the inﬂuence of gut
microbiota on behavior development. Later in 2013, the
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) launched a
special project to explore the mechanism involved in gut
microbiotaebrain communication, with a view to develop
treatments for mental diseases [2e4]. Although the exact
mechanism of gut microbiotaebrain axis is still an ongoing
research, the evidence from animals and human studies has
showed that gut microbiota can play an important role in
brain behavior and cognitive development by producing
hormones, immune factors, and metabolites, which also
indicates that altering the gut microbiota may improve or
even cure brain diseases besides other metabolic diseases.
Interestingly, though the gut microbiota and the brain
interact with each other, the gut microbiota can be regar-
ded as an independent variable in gut microbiotaebrain
axis, its effect on the brain regarded as a dependent
variable [5].

Gut microbiota
Approximately 100 trillion bacteria live in an adult human
body, 80% of which exist in the gut, about 10 times as
many as cells in human body. The gut microbiome hosts
more than 1000 bacterial species. The human microbiome
is composed of more than 5000 strains of microbes [6e9].
The bacteria, mainly anaerobic bacteria, dominate this
environment. Gut microbiota is ever changing with human
development and inﬂuenced by various factors. Throughout
different life stages, various changes occur in the microbial
diversity of humans. The fetus ﬁrst comes in contact with
microbes during birth. After birth, the ﬁrst colonizers of the
gut are facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus,
Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus. These colonizers
consume oxygen, creating an anaerobic environment lead-
ing to an increase of Clostridium, Bacteroides, and Biﬁ-
dobacteria, which are strict anaerobes. During the early
postnatal period, diet plays a key role in shaping the gut
microbiota composition [10,11]. The infant gut microbiota
goes through a number of compositional changes during
the ﬁrst 2 years of life. And from the second year of life, the
microbial composition undergoes an important shift toward
the stable gut microbiota proﬁle of the adult, which is
composed mainly of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. During
adulthood the gut microbiota remains relatively stable until
aging, when considerable changes occur [12]. The intesti-
nal microbes are markedly affected by numerous factors
such as host genetics, mode of delivery, life style, diet, use
of antibiotics, vaccinations, hygiene, and health [13]. More
than 50% of the variation of gut microbiota has been related
to dietary changes [14].
Gut microbiota plays a major role in host health by
shaping the development of the immune system, metabo-
lizing dietary nutrients and drugs, digesting complex indi-
gestible polysaccharides, and synthesizing vitamins and
bioactive molecules. The gut microbiota constitutes the
intestinal barrier, promotes the continuous existence of the
microbes, stimulates intestinal epithelial cell regeneration,
produces mucus, and nourishes mucosa by producing short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [15].
Gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis
What connects the gut and the brain is a bidirectional
communication pathway called the gut-brain axis, which
connects the enteric nervous system to the central nervous
system [16] The gut-brain axis is a complex bidirectional
communication system that is mediated by hormonal,
immunological, and neural signals, between the gut and the
brain. Through the gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota may
have an impact on neurodevelopmental processes and brain
functions. The communication involves the gut microbiota
and their metabolic products, enteric nervous system
(ENS), sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, neural-
immune system, neuroendocrine system, and central ner-
vous system (CNS). Studies suggest ﬁve possible routes of
communicating
brain,
including the gut-brain’s neural network, neuroendocrine-
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, gut immune
system, some neurotransmitters, and neural regulators
synthesized by gut bacteria, and barriers including intesti-
nal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier (Fig. 13.1). In
this network, the brain affects gut movement, sensory and
secretion function, and viscera signal from the gut also
affect brain function.
Also, the intestinal microbiota and diet play an impor-
tant role in this gut-brain interaction system that is involved
in the normal brain functioning as well as the pathogenesis
of psychiatric disorders and many others [17]. Following
the development of gut microbiota, researchers not only
focus on the top-down effects of the brain-gut axis (from
brain to gut), but they also pay close attention to the down-
top inﬂuences (from gut to brain) [18e21]. Factors such as
psychological stress and disease impairing one or more
pathways of the brain-gut axis probably induce brain-gut
axis dysfunction and result in depression [20,22,23].
An alteration of gut microbiota and metabolism,
through dietary or any other environmental factor, can
cause a state of dysbiosis, which is characterized by an
overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms [24]. This

cation routes between gut microbiota and brain: 1. neuroanatomic pathway

change in the balance can induce reduced intestinal barrier
function (leaky gut) and subsequent chronic inﬂammation.
Dysregulation of the gut-brain axis communication may be
associated to some metabolic and inﬂammatory disorders,
visceral pain, and even alterations to CNS functioning [25].
Dysbiosis could also contribute to disruption of the mo-
lecular dialogue existing within the gut and brain. Hence
the relationship between the gut microbiota, chronic
inﬂammation, and the CNS suggests that microbial dys-
biosis could alter brain function and hence contribute to
behavioral and cognitive abnormalities.
Gut microbiota is a key component of the gut brain. The
complex gut-brain axis is formed by the CNS) the enteric
innervation that includes extrinsic ﬁbers of the autonomous
nervous system (ANS) and intrinsic neurons of the ENS,
the HPA axis (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) and the in-
testinal microbiota [26]. The extrinsic innervations of the
GI tract connect the gut with the brain through vagal and
spinal ﬁbers, while the brain sends efferent sympathetic and
parasympathetic ﬁbers to the GI tract [27e29].
The HPA axis is the main regulator of the stress
response and regulates different body processes including
bowel function during digestion. Corticotrophin releasing
factor (CRF) released by the HPA axis and different
members of its family affect gastrointestinal tract function:
bowel motility [30,31], bowel permeability [32,33], and
bowel inﬂammation [34,35]. Studies show that stress is also
linked to gastrointestinal diseases like IBD or colitis [36].
Dysbiosis has been linked to intestinal and systemic in-
ﬂammatory tone, which is a mechanism contributing to
mood disorders such as depression [37] in inﬂammatory
conditions such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) [38]
and obesity.
Impact of gut microbiota on CNS
Brain is the main modulator of gut homeostasis, controlling
the motility of the gut and secretion of acid, bicarbonates,
and mucus [39]. Research shows several mechanisms how
microbiota impacts the CNS, both, physiologically and
pathologically (Fig. 13.2). According to the gut microbiota
hypothesis, the gut microbiota can inﬂuence the brain and
behavior through the gut-brain axis.
The impact of gut microbiota on the CNS and behavior
has been demonstrated in intervention studies with pro-
biotics or antibiotics in rodents and, in a few cases, in
humans.
The regulation of mood and cognition depends on the
availability of tryptophan in the CNS, which in turn de-
pends on the availability of peripheral tryptophan, which is
altered in GF mice. Clarke et al. demonstrated that the
absence of gut microbiota in GF mice in early life increased
plasma tryptophan, suggesting a possible humoral pathway
by which the microbiota could inﬂuence CNS serotonergic
neurotransmission [40]. Also, they observed an increase in
5-HT and its main metabolite, hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in
hippocampus compared to normal animals. Furthermore,
the colonization of the GF animals post weaning was not
sufﬁcient to reverse the CNS neurochemical consequences
in adulthood due to a lack of microbiota in early life, even
though the baseline values of tryptophan availability were
restored. Nishino et al. (2013) also showed that GF mice
exposed to the SPF environment for 24 h developed a
normal (SPF) microbiota and that was accompanied by a
decrease in the anxiouslike behavior and an increase in
ADE, DA, and 5-HT brain levels [41]. Other authors
showed that GF animals present a signiﬁcant reduction of
5-HT in serum compared to normal mice (SPF) [42e50].
Studies showed that host-microbiota interactions are very
important in regulating essential 5-HT-related biological
processes. Agusti et al. showed that 5-HT is signiﬁcantly
decreased in hippocampus of HFD-fed mice and this
correlated with anhedonic-depressive-like behavior [43].
The administration of Biﬁdobacterium pseudocatenulatum
CECT 7765 attenuated the obesity-associated depressive
like behavior and signiﬁcantly increased the 5-HT con-
centration
modifying
microbiota.
Other authors have also shown that components of the
microbiota are able to produce molecules that act as local
neurotransmitters in the ENS, for example, gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-HT, acetylcholine, mela-
tonin, or histamine [44,45]. GABA can also be affected by
the gut microbiota. Bravo et al. [46] observed that the
administration of L. rhamnosus JB-1 altered mRNA GABA
receptors in different brain regions of mice. GABA b1b
receptor expression was increased in cortical cingulate and
prelimbic regions, whereas it decreased in the hippocam-
pus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus. In the prefrontal cortex
(PFCx) and amygdala there was a decrease in GABA Aa2
mRNA, but an increase in the hippocampus. This was
accompanied by attenuation of stress, anxiety and depres-
sivelike behaviors in healthy animals. Results of the same
study conﬁrmed that communication between the micro-
biota and the brain occurred partly via the vagus nerve,
which provided information from the lumen to the CNS
[46]. This was evident when vagotomized animals failed to
show neurochemical and behavioral effects. Thus, the
vagus nerve was identiﬁed as a constitutive modulator of
the communication pathway between the gut microbiota
and the brain.
Another study also showed reduced expression of the
synaptic plasticity-related genes PSD-95 and synaptophy-
sin in the striatum [49]. Together these ﬁndings indicate
that the presence of commensal bacteria in the gut is critical
for normal brain development. However, animal studies
reveal that a change in the microbial composition of the gut,
induced by diet or antimicrobials, causes change in brain

chemistry and function [51,52]. The oral administration of
antimicrobials resulted in an increase in brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and a
reduction in anxietylike behavior. It is clear that these
changes were not seen following intraperitoneal adminis-
tration of the antimicrobial drugs, but the changes in brain
chemistry and function were attributed to the shift in the
intestinal microbial community. Conﬁrmation of the mi-
crobial inﬂuence on the brain was obtained by showing that
brain chemistry and behavioral phenotype could be adop-
tively transferred across mouse strains via the intestinal
microbiota [49,51]. Microbiome composition in mouse
exposed to a long-term restraint stress was signiﬁcantly
different from that of a nonstressed mouse [53]. Stress can
reduce the quantity of Bacteroides at cecum and increase
the number of Clostridium [54]. Stress also increased
interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)
levels in blood, and MCP-1 was signiﬁcantly related with
the changes of three kinds of stress-induced bacteria of
Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and aerogenic
bacteria Dorea strain [54,55].
Gut microbiotaebrain communication
Diet signiﬁcantly modiﬁes host gut microbiota’s composi-
tion and function. The gut microbiota is capable of
extracting from its diet nutrients to bioactive signaling
molecules such as neurometabolites, vitamins, and short-
chain fatty acids (SCFA) [56]. Many of these molecules
such as serotonin and GABA have neuroactive functions
due to their capacity to modulate neural signaling within
the enteric nervous system and consequently inﬂuence
brain function and host behavior [57]. This gut-brain axis
plays an important role in homeostasis between neural
systems, hormonal and immunological signaling. Through
this complex network the gut can inﬂuence the brain via
visceral messages, and conversely, the brain is able to in-
ﬂuence gastrointestinal functions (like motility, secretion,
and mucin production) and immune functions, such as the
modulation of cytokine production by cells of the mucosal
immune system [58]. Both luminal nutrients and gut
microbiota metabolites stimulate enteroendrocrine cells
(EECs) located throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
FIGURE 13.2
Link between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and CNS. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota due to lifestyle factors like unhealthy diets and stress
likely is related to obesity and its adverse consequences on mood and cognition. A healthy diet rich in ﬁber is thought to increase gut microbiota diversity
and, thereby, contributes to epithelial gut integrity, immune homeostasis, and normal CNS function through the gut-brain axis. On the contrary, Western-
dietary patterns (high-fat diet and high-carb diet rich in simple sugars) lead to reduction in the microbial diversity. This promotes inﬂammation and
contributes to the leaky gut syndrome; this facilitates the translocation of components of gram-negative bacteria, which increases the peripheral in-
ﬂammatory tone and produces neuroinﬂammation and alterations in the CNS. According to Augusti et al., as a dietary intervention, the use of probiotics,
prebiotics, and high-ﬁber diet could beneﬁcially impact obesity and mental complications via restoration of a healthy microbiota and its regulatory role in
the gut-brain axis. From Agusti A, García-Pardo MP, López-Almela I, Campillo I, et al. Interplay between the gut-brain axis, obesity and cognitive

which represents the largest endocrine organ in the human
body [59]. These EECs contain most of the nutrient re-
ceptors such as those for amino acids, peptones, SCFAs,
long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), and oleoylethanolamide
(OEA) (Fig. 13.3). Molecular sensing by these EEC’s is
crucial in the control of multiple functions during digestion,
the initiation of neural and hormonal responses or changes
in mucosal ion transport which controls appetite, insulin
secretion, and motility [60]. Moreover, as the nervous and
endocrine signaling between the gut and the brain is
essential for the modulation of many GI functions, the
sensing receptors of the gut that control the release of many
hormones play a key role. Several interacting factors such
as diet and microbiota composition modulate the activation
of different sensory receptors in the gut, and consequently
stimulate up or downregulation of hormonal release which
can induce a number of functional GI changes. Interest-
ingly, increasing evidence indicates that animals fed on a
high-fat diet present numerous changes in gastrointestinal
function, particularly in the secretion and signaling of
gastrointestinal hormones, which may predispose the GI
tract to an increase in energy intake, and consequently, to
weight gain and obesity [61].
In addition to its role as a sensory organ, the gut forms
part of the enteric nervous system, which makes up a
comprehensive division of the autonomic nervous system,
containing between 200 and 600 million neurons [60]. The
vagus nerve (the major nerve of the parasympathetic divi-
sion of the autonomic nervous system) is crucially involved
in bidirectional signaling between the gastrointestinal and
nervous systems.
The human intestine also acts as an endocrine organ
through direct and indirect production of microbial me-
tabolites and neurometabolites such as SCFAs, vitamins,
and neurotransmitters, which have also been shown to in-
ﬂuence gut-brain interactions. GABA and serotonin are

endocrine, neuronal, and immune systems. Dietary composition determines the type of nutrients that reach the luminal gastrointestinal tract and alter the
composition of the gut microbiota and consequently the production of their metabolites, which can inﬂuence: epithelial permeability by acting on the cells
from the immune system (1), activity of enteroendocrine cells (2) or tight junction protein function (3). The gut luminal content is continuously monitored
by the intestine to optimize nutrient assimilation and protect against hazards which can affect its integrity. Therefore, the intestine is conferred with a range
of sensory receptors which interact with major effector systems such as the endocrine system, the nervous system, the gut immune system, and the
nonimmune defense systems of the gut. Hormone release triggered by the activation of nutrient-speciﬁc receptors found on the enteroendrocrine cells
occurs along the entire gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the large intestine. There are several types of enteroendocrine cells such as L cells or I
cells with sensory receptors that stimulate the release of different types of hormones (4), which have a wide range of effects such as satiety through the
hypothalamus, gastrointestinal motility and acid secretion. Aas, amino acids; Ach, acetylcholine; APCs, antigen-presenting cells; CCK, cholecystokinin;

neurotransmitters that can inﬂuence host behavior and are
produced directly or indirectly by certain commensal mi-
crobes [62,63]. SCFAs including butyrate, propionate, and
acetate can be produced by species such as Roseburia spp.
and Faecalibacterium following fermentation of indigestible
polysaccharides [64]. Butyrate and propionate can modulate
brain functioning, in particular appetite regulation and en-
ergy homeostasis [65] through regulation of neuropeptide
production. Many supporting studies have demonstrated the
potential for high fat and other obesogenic diets to promote
inﬂammation and microbiota-targeted interventions, such as
prebiotics and probiotics to reverse inﬂammatory status [66].
Chronic inﬂammation has been linked to a number of
neurological disorders including depression and dementia
[66], and hence microbiota-associated chronic inﬂammation
may inﬂuence risk of such disorders. Due to the fact that
many of these gastrointestinal pathways signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ence neurological function, there is potential for dietary in-
terventions that increase bacterial metabolism and promote
growth of beneﬁcial bacteria, to positively modulate the gut-
brain axis and improve symptoms of psychiatric illness.
Moreover, bearing in mind the potential link between the gut
anxiety-related
behavior,
recently focused on the health beneﬁts of probiotic admin-
istration on psychiatric illnesses [67].
How does gut microbiota affect the
brain?
The gut microbiota exerts effects on the brain through the
nervous system (gut-brain’s neuroanatomical pathway), the
endocrine system, immune system, and metabolic system.
Neuroanatomical pathways
The gut can interact with the brain through two neuroana-
tomical pathways. One pathway is a mutual information
exchange directly between gut and brain by the ANS and
vagus nerve (VN) in the spinal cord; and the one is a
bidirectional
communication
through the dual communication between ENS in the gut
and ANS and VN within the spinal cord. The neural
anatomical pathways for controlling gut functions form a
hierarchic four-level integrative organization: [68,69]
1. ENS, including myenteric ganglia, submucous gan-
glion, and gut glial cells; [70,71]
2. Prevertebral ganglia regulating peripheral visceral reﬂex
responses [72];
3. ANS in the spinal cord (from T5-L2 sympathetic nerve
and S2eS4 parasympathetic nervous system) and brain
stem nucleus tractus solitarius and dorsal motor nucleus
of VN, which receive and give the origin of afferent and
efferent ﬁber of VN, respectively. The most important
effect of the dorsal motor nucleus of VN is prominent
in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and the cholinergic
neurons on myenteron of upper gastrointestinal tract
regulate vagal excitability effect [73];
4. The higher brain centers. Information from cortex and
subcortical centers including basal ganglia funnels
down to peculiar brainstem nuclei. Brainstem nuclei
control many gut functions. The afferent ﬁber of VN
stops at the brain stem nucleus, tractus solitarius, which
then gives ﬁber upward and arrives at thalamus, lobus
limbicus, and insular cortex through parabrachial nu-
cleus. Spinal afferent ﬁber goes upward within spino-
thalamic
tract
spinal
tract
thalamus
(spinothalamic tract) and gracile nucleus and cuneate
nucleus of medulla oblongata (spinal tract), respec-
tively, then projects ﬁber to thalamus through lemniscus
medialis. Fiber is projected from thalamus to the pri-
mary sensorimotor areas and insular cortex.
Direct neural communication between gut microbiota
and the brain is mainly realized through VN, i.e., bacteria
stimulates afferent neurons of ENS, and the vagal signal
from the gut can stimulate the antiinﬂammatory response,
preventing against pyosepticemia caused by microorgan-
isms. Further research showed that many effects of gut
microbiota or potential probiotics on brain functions were
independent of vagal activation [39,48], and bacteria settled
in the gut played a critically important role in individual’s
postnatal development and the maturation of the immune
system, the endocrine system, and the nervous system [74].
Neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis
Gut microbiota is helpful for the maturation of neuroen-
docrine system. Lacking gut microbiota and low/lack of
expression of tolllike receptors (TLRs) contribute to pro-
ducing a neuroendocrine response to the pathogen in the
gut [76,77]. One study showed that the response of TLR4-
knockout mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by
gram-negative bacteria was reduced [78]. Compared with
SPF mice, mild restraint stress led to signiﬁcantly elevated
corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone in GF
mice. GF mice’s stress response could be partially reversed
by fecal microbial transplant, and completely reversed over
time by Biﬁdobacterium infantis [48]. The study clearly
showed the feces containing gut microbiota were vital for
the postnatal development of appropriate stress reaction,
and the timing that microbiota appeared in early life was a
very narrow window, which was extremely important for
normal development of HPA axis.
Gut microbiota can affect behavior related with the
stress response. Many studies have shown the changes of
hippocampal NMDA and 5-HT1A receptor of GF animals


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 196

[48]. These receptors affect the release and expression of
the corticotropin-releasing hormone of the hypothalamus
and then change the function of HPA. Stress and HPA axis
can affect the composition of the gut microbiome.
Neurotransmitters and neural regulators
synthesized by intestinal bacteria
Gut bacteria can synthesize gamma amino acid, butyric
acid, 5-HT, dopamine, and SCFAs [75] and these sub-
stances may have an effect on the brain. The neurotrans-
mitters generated by the gut microbiota, exert an inﬂuence
on the human brain.
Intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain
barrier (barrier system)
Evidence from rodent studies showed that stress changed
intestinal mucosal barrier function that cause LPS and other
cytokines to enter the blood circulation, and stimulate
TLR4 and other TLRs producing inﬂammatory cytokines
[79]. Peripherally produced inﬂammatory factors could
increase the permeability of blood-brain barrier that directly
inﬂuences the brain [80]. Therefore, studies show that gut
microbiota plays a critical role in the brain development
and function [81,82].
Microbiota-gut-brain axis and
Studies have shown association between the brain-gut axis
and depression [18]. It is shown that the gut microbiota can
inﬂuence the behavior and mind. The gut microbiota of
depressed patients is different from that of healthy controls.
The microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction is the main
pathophysiology of depression, according to the gut
microbiota hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, gut
microbiota regulation and the following microbiota-gut-
brain axis improvement will alleviate and treat depression.
Logan and Katzman suggested that probiotics may be an
adjuvant therapy for major depression in 2005 [93]. Some
research found that the number of Bacteroidetes and Pro-
teobacteria increased while those of Firmicutes decreased
[83e85] in depressed patients. The abundance of Lacto-
bacillus and Biﬁdobacterium also declined [86]. Although
all these studies have shown the gut microbiota abnor-
malities of depressed patients, the deﬁnite distinctions be-
tween that of patients and controls are still in debate
[87e89]. Animal studies also presented the microbiota
differences between depressed and control subjects. The
animal models showed results similar to human subjects
[90e92].
Microbiota-gut-brain axis and autism
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves a disorder in
brain development and is characterized by the inability to
socialize, communicate, and use imagination, and displays
stereotypical behavior.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) handbook lists ﬁve sub-
types
ASD:
autistic
disorder;
Asperger
disorder;
childhood disintegrative disorder; pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise speciﬁed; and Rett disorder. There is
scientiﬁc consensus that autism involves a disorder in brain
function and development [96e99]. Though the exact
cause of the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with
ASD is unclear; it has been found that there are large dif-
ferences in microbiotic composition between ASD patients
and controls [100]. Commonly it is seen that children with
ASD display gastrointestinal symptoms, and an increased
intestinal permeability. Probably the abnormalities in car-
bohydrate digestion and absorption could cause some of the
gastrointestinal problems observed in a subset of ASD
patients, although their role in the neurological and
behavioral problems remains uncertain. However, there is a
relationship between an improved gut health and a reduc-
tion of symptoms in some patients [94,95].
GI abnormalities in the gut of autistic children compared
sibling
controls
[101e104] Studies have shown that 70,% of children with
ASD report having a history of GI complaints, against 28%
of neurotypical controls, and that GI symptoms are strongly
correlated with the severity of autism [104]. The GI ab-
normalities found in autistic children include malabsorption
[105], maldigestion [106,107], microbial overgrowth, and
abnormal intestinal permeability [108]. Bolte hypothesized
that abnormal gut microbiota may be involved in the eti-
ology of ASD patients [109]. It is hypothesized that relapse
in autistic children after discontinuation of antibiotic treat-
ment is due to the presence of Clostridium spores which
then germinate to cause recurrence of the disease; and
incidence of autism is related to the widespread exposure to
Clostridium spores in the environment.
Research reveals that the relationship between micro-
biota and (late-onset) ASD involves high levels of urinary
indolyl-3-acryloylglycine (IAG). IAG is a regular constit-
uent of human urine and is produced by gut microﬂora
[110,111]. The high levels of IAG in urine indicate
dysbiosis.
Microbiota-gut-brain axis and aging
Aging affects the brain in several ways, from the cellular to
the functional level. Changes associated with age manifest
themselves as decline in several abilities, including sensory,
motor, and higher cognitive functions [47,112,113]. The


<!-- chunk -->

advanced stage of cognitive deterioration in aged popula-
tion is manifested by dementia. Mild cognitive impairment
is an intermediate stage of cognitive deterioration in which
functional independence is preserved, but there is impair-
ment in one or more cognitive areas [114]. Alzheimer dis-
ease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly
people. It is clear that the microbial diversity is reduced in
elderly people but there is temporal stability. Like in
younger age groups, Bacteroides and Firmicutes remain
prominent in older age, but possible changes in the ratio of
these are unclear. There is increased relative abundance of
Proteobacteria and a reduction in Biﬁdobacteria species.
There is an age-related reduction in SCFAs production,
especially butyrate that plays a critical role in the mainte-
nance of colonic epithelial integrity and inﬂammation. The
changes in microbial composition and metabolism are
consistent with the concept of inﬂamm-aging which in-
dicates chronic low-grade inﬂammation as a common basis
of several age-related pathologies, including cognitive
decline [115]. In a study on healthy elderly populations, the
subjects were segregated into those living in the community
and those institutionalized for short or long terms. It was
observed that there was a reduction in the frequency of
genes encoding SCFA production among the institutional-
ized elderly people due to increase in circulating proin-
ﬂammatory
tumor
necrosis
factor-alpha,
interleukins- 6 and 8, and a C-reactive protein. Signiﬁcant
correlations were found between microbiome proﬁles and
indices of frailty and poor health among long-term institu-
tionalized elderly people. Also, changes in their dietary
composition and diversity were considered the main drivers
of the shifts in microbiome (Fig. 13.4) - [116]. Evidence
shows that inﬂammation is primarily responsible for the
cognitive decline, not only as a process of normal aging, but
also in neurological disorders and sporadic AD [116].
A study showed that the administration of a neutralizing
p40 antibody reduced the amyloid load in the brain in the
APPPS 1 murine model of AD. The authors proposed a
central role for activated microglia in promoting neuro-
inﬂammation in the APPPS1 model, and it is possible that
activation of brain microglia is primed by the intestinal
microbiome. These ﬁndings are indicative of associations
between age-related changes in the intestinal microbiome
and low-grade inﬂammation in humans with declining
cognitive function [117].
Microbiota-gut-brain axis and obesity
Obesity is a metabolic condition that is a consequence of
lifestyle changes such as a sedentary lifestyle and high-fat
and high-carb/sugar diets. It is scientiﬁcally established
that dietary habits are linked to alterations in the intestinal
microbiota that could also contribute to the pathophysi-
ology of obesity and subsequent metabolic and psycho-
logical complications [45]. Obesity may contribute to
behavioral alterations (see Fig. 13.5), and cognitive damage
[118], which may partly be due to neuroinﬂammatory
processes. Obesity may also have effects on episodic and
semantic memory. Studies on animal models have shown a
relationship
obesity,
neuroinﬂammation,
memory impairments associated with cognitive decline and
elevated risk of neurodegenerative diseases [119]. There is
increasing evidence that higher adiposity, both in respect of
BMI and central obesity, in mid-life is a risk factor for
subsequent impairment in cognitive functioning, and has
been identiﬁed as a modiﬁable risk factor for cognitive
decline and impairment [120]. Obese subjects (BMI greater
than 25), between 22 and 82 years of age, showed a poorer
executive function test performance than normal weight
adults (BMI, 18.5e24.9 kg/m2) and differences in the
attention test performance, thereby suggesting an associa-
tion between elevated BMI and lower cognitive perfor-
mance, independently of age. Impaired working memory
performance has also been demonstrated in overweight and
obese young adults compared with healthy weight controls.
Decision-making performance is also altered in obese
populations. Performance decrements in the executive
functions of concept formation and set-shifting, measured
by performance on the Wisconsin card sorting test, are also
shown in obese cohorts relative to normal weight com-
parison groups [120e122]. Decision-making performance
is also altered in obese populations.
Higher body mass index was associated with lower
cognition scores in healthy, middle-aged, nondemented
participants [126]. Also, obese children showed alterations
in attention and attentional shifting and visuospatial abili-
ties compared to normal weight children [123e125].
Higher intake of a Western diet at age 14 was associated
with worse cognitive performance 3 years later as per an
Australian cohort study among school-aged children [127].
Research reports that fat and sugar intake at different life
FIGURE 13.4

periods may also impair cognition. Higher intake of
carbohydrates, particularly simple sugars, has been asso-
ciated with impaired cognitive functions [128]. Saturated
fatty acids (SFAs) have been associated with cognitive
impairments; increased vulnerability to cognitive deﬁcits in
later years of life, and neurological diseases. Higher intake
of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and higher PUFA to
SFA ratios have been associated with improved memory
functions among children and decreased risk of memory
impairments [129]. It was shown that the daily consump-
tion of low-fat foods may improve cognitive performance.
Several studies indicate that obesity increases the risk of
depression by 55% and depression increases the risk for
obesity onset by 58% [130,131]. Depression has been
associated with alterations in the gut microbiota in a few
cross-sectional studies [132]. The possible mediating
mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis could contribute to
mood alterations could be alterations in tryptophan meta-
bolism [84]. Microbiota may also be involved in diet-
related social behavioral alterations.
Role of diet in the microbiota-gut-brain axis
The diet plays a key role in the composition of the gut
microbiome. It alters the gut bacteria and inﬂuences the
immune system and circuits of inﬂammation which are
known to be involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric
disorders such as depression (Fig. 13.6). Neurotrophic
factors such as the BDNF are essential for neuronal plas-
ticity and are also modiﬁed by dietary factors [1]. It is very
well established that nutrition has a major impact on mental
health with serious nutritional deﬁciencies contributing to
the pathogenesis of depressive and psychotic disorders.
The increase in the consumption of high-fat diets in the
past few decades has been associated with obesity. Many
studies have shown that high-fat diets lead to a decrease in
Bacteroidetes and an increase in Firmicutes. These effects
may be associated with increased gut permeability, a higher
capacity for energy harvest and storage, and inﬂammation
leading to obesity [137].
Interestingly, studies comparing rural and Western
communities have revealed speciﬁc gut microbiota adap-
tations to their respective environments. The adaptations to
Westernization have resulted in loss of several bacterial
species, and hence subsequent reduction in microbial di-
versity and stability. One study has clearly shown reduction
in microbiota diversity while comparing an Italian urban
control group to a hunter-gatherer community [135].
Moreover, recent investigations have reported the impact of
diet on the microbial biodiversity within different human
populations. African children, who consume a low-fat and
high-ﬁber diet, presented less potentially pathogenic bac-
teria and greater degree of microbial diversity than Euro-
pean children consuming a Western high-fat diet. African
children had a depletion in Firmicutes and showed increase
in Bacteroidetes (Xylanibacter and Prevotella), while Eu-
ropean children showed a signiﬁcant increase of Firmicutes
(Faecalibacterium and Acetitomaculum) and Enterobac-
teriaceae (Shigella and Escherichia) [136].
FIGURE 13.5
Mood and cognitive alterations in obesity: the role of the gut-brain axis. In obese population, it has been observed that the diversity and
stability of the gut microbiota can be affected by high-fat diets (HFD) or high-carb diets leading to dysbiosis. This alteration in the microbiota may alter the
communication between the gut and the brain axis contributing to mood alterations like anxiety, depression, sensitivity to stress, social behavioral al-
terations. In addition, cognitive alterations like hippocampal dysfunction, impaired memory, and reduction of attention or the executive function are also
seen. Recently, the use of some probiotics has demonstrated to improve anxiety or depression through different mechanisms in animal models.

Early modiﬁcations of diet seem crucial for the pre-
vention of psychiatric disease. This was clear from The
PREDIMED trial showed that a Mediterranean style diet
rich in nuts led to a reduced risk for developing depression
[138]. A classical Mediterranean diet mainly consists of
vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, ﬁsh, and unsaturated fatty
acids. De Filippis et al. observed that Italian subjects with a
high adherence to a Mediterranean diet had greater abun-
dance of Prevotella and SCFAs [139]. High-ﬁber diets
have been positively associated with Actinobacteria and
Bacteroidetes presence. Diets rich in plant ﬁbers may
promote the diversiﬁcation of the microbiota by promoting
hydrolytic bacteria and stimulating the production of
SCFAs [136].
Based on the data, it is evident that nutritional in-
terventions are an important pillar in the multifactorial,
biopsychosocial treatment of psychiatric disease and could
be used as a potential therapeutic target. The prebiotics,
probiotics, and postbiotics have a great scope as therapeutic
agents, as they can positively inﬂuence the gut-brain axis
thereby altering the gut composition.
Prebiotics and probiotics
Recent works by several experts have shown that the
composition of the gut microbiome can be positively
inﬂuenced by the prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotic is
deﬁned as “a substrate that is selectively utilized by host
microorganisms conferring a health beneﬁt” [148,149].
Prebiotics consist of nondigestible nutritional components
that may favor the growth of intestinal bacteria. Complex
carbohydrates,
fructans
glucans,
fructose-
oligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide (GOS) are pre-
biotics which could affect the intestinal microbiome.
Certain prebiotics have the potential to inﬂuence CNS
functioning

microbial
growth and production of SCFAs. Tarr et al. reported that a
social disruption stressor signiﬁcantly altered gut microbiota
composition in mice, which resulted in anxietylike behavior
and a reduction in the growth of neurons in the hippo-
campus [140]. A number of small clinical controlled trials
have assessed the efﬁcacy of certain prebiotics on psycho-
logical outcomes with positive results. In a 3-week sup-
plementation with a GOS prebiotic, which has been shown
to stimulate biﬁdobacterial growth in healthy volunteers
signiﬁcantly reduced their cortisol levels, a stress hormone
strongly that is linked to anxiety and depression [141]. Data
suggests that shaping of microbiota composition through
prebiotic intake could inﬂuence behavioral outcomes [141].
In humans, prebiotic supplementation with trans-galacto
oligosaccharides (trans-GOS) not only enhanced biﬁdo-
bacterial growth and improved bloating symptoms, but also
reduced anxiety scores in IBS patients [142].
Probiotics are deﬁned as “live microorganisms which
when administered in adequate amounts confer a health
beneﬁt on the host” [143]. Their beneﬁcial effects not only
restricted to the gut, but reach the whole microbiota-gut-
brain axis. A number of studies have reported certain
FIGURE 13.6
Impact of diet on the gut microbiota and routes of communication of the gut-brain axis. A state of dysbiosis leads to an increased
inﬂammation and leaky gut. One of the mechanisms involved is the vagus nerve signaling, immune activation, tryptophan metabolism, and production of
microbial metabolites and neurometabolites. Some of these metabolites signiﬁcantly impact neurological function. In this regard, the diet interventions that
increase bacterial metabolism and promote growth of beneﬁcial bacteria modulate the gut-brain axis positively and thereby the CNS function. Ach,

probiotic strains, primarily Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobac-
teria, to enhance brain function in both rodents and
humans. Since the live organisms confer a beneﬁt to host
psychiatric health, they are commonly termed as “psycho-
biotics,” which act as therapies for psychiatric disorders.
Dinan et al. proposed the concept of “psychobiotics” to
emphasize the potential of probiotics in the treatment of
mental disorders [67]. Despite the promising evidence in
animals, these results have yet to be fully translated into
humans. However with larger randomized controlled trials,
there is potential for psychobiotics to be effective psychi-
atric therapeutics. Studies have shown that psychobiotic
supplementation alleviates depression symptoms, similar to
traditional antidepressant therapies. In double-blind, ran-
domized, placebo-controlled studies, psychobiotic treat-
ments alleviated the symptoms of depression and anxiety in
patients and improved their cognition [144e146]. Animal
studies indicate that the antidepressant effects of psycho-
biotics are closely related
to the regulation
of the
microbiota-gut-brain axis [18,147]. The beneﬁcial psycho-
biotics that have been reported to be effective are strains of
Lactobacillus casei [144,147], Lactobacillus helveticus,
and Biﬁdobacterium biﬁdum. Ref - Table 13.1.
In the pilot study by Bambling et al. [150] there were
signiﬁcant improvements in depressive symptoms during
supplementation of probiotics, which, however, ceased af-
ter discontinuation of the probiotics after 8 weeks. In a
study, Biﬁdobacterium infantis restored the forced swim-
ming test and decreased proinﬂammatory cytokines regu-
lating tryptophan metabolism and the neurotransmitters in
the CNS in a rat model of depression induced by maternal
separation [151].
Mice deﬁcient in interleukin-10 placed on a Western-
style diet exhibited anxietylike behavior and impaired
memory, and these changes were prevented by treatment
with the probiotic containing Lactobacillus helveticus
[152]. The effects of probiotic bacteria imply a role for the
microbiome-gut-brain axis in the behavioral abnormities.
underlying
microbiome-to-brain
include microbial metabolites acting on the brain; immune
activation; and endocrine and neural pathways, including
vagal afferents [153]. In a study, probiotic strains of Biﬁ-
dobacterium and Lactobacillus have been reported to
improve mood and reduce anxiety symptoms in patients
with IBD and chronic fatigue syndrome [93,154]. The
mechanisms by which probiotics could mediate beneﬁcial
effects include their possible immune regulatory properties
and their ability to modify neurotransmission. The mono-
amine neurotransmitter 5-HT is produced from tryptophan,
ingested with the diet. This neurotransmitter plays a role in
cognition and mood in the brain. However, 95% of 5-HT is
produced in the gut, speciﬁcally by the cells of the mucosa
and in the nerve terminals of ENS neurons. The function of
5-HT in the GI tract is related to GI motility, secretion, and
pain perception. 5-HT also has neuroprotective, trophic
factor actions and proinﬂammatory actions in the gut [155].
The gut microbiota may have the ability to modulate im-
mune mediators (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) and vagal
nerve signaling and to generate or regulate the synthesis of
neuroactive
metabolites
endocrine
secretions
(e.g., glucocorticoids, neuropeptides, etc.) or their receptors
[156]. Bravo et al. [46] observed that L. rhamnosus JB-1
altered mRNA GABA receptors in different brain regions
in association with attenuation of stress, anxiety, and
depressivelike behaviors in normal healthy animals. They
identiﬁed the vagus nerve as a constitutive modulator of the
communication pathway between gut microbiota and brain
when vagotomized animals could not show neurochemical
and behavioral effects [46].
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study by Parracho
et al., children with ASD were fed with Lactobacillus
plantarum for 12 weeks. The results showed signiﬁcant
increase in lactobacilli and enterococci, and a signiﬁcant
reduction of Clostridium, compared with the placebo
group. The study result showed improved behavior scores
compared with baseline after probiotic intervention. There
are also some studies reporting beneﬁcial effects of pro-
biotics on cognitive functions. In a study a mix of Biﬁdo-
bacterium biﬁdum W23, Biﬁdobacterium lactis W52,
Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus brevis W63,
Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus salivarius W24
and L. lactis W19 and W58 improved cognitive reactivity
to sad mood in normal individuals [133]. A study of healthy
women treated with probiotic fermented milk showed
modulation in brain activity involved in cognitive perfor-
mance [55]. The ﬁndings of these studies collectively
suggest that obesity and emotional disorders, such as anx-
iety and depression, are inﬂuenced by the gut microbiome
due to its role in the inﬂammatory tone. Additionally, some
probiotic strains with antidepressive effects also showed
antiobesity effects, suggesting that modulation of micro-
biota composition or their function could be beneﬁcial for
obesity-related depression [134]. Animal studies showed
that administration of Lactobacillus helveticus restored the
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio altered in HFD-fed mice and
also reduced anxiety behaviors. Abildgaard et al. (2017)
showed that when a mix of eight different strains of Biﬁ-
dobacterium and Lactobacillus were introduced, it lowered
IL-6 and TNF-a levels in serum and also reduced depres-
sivelike behaviors in HFD-fed mice. Therefore, the bene-
ﬁcial effects could be due to their ability to reduce the
inﬂammatory tone affecting both obesity and mood disor-
ders [26]. To summarize, psychobiotics and/or prebiotics
diet regulation has shown to be effective in regulating the
gut microbiota and thereby improving the microbiota-gut-
brain axis function.

There is increasing evidence that gut microbiota can play
an important role in brain behavior and cognitive devel-
opment. Studies suggest that diet-induced gut microbiota
modiﬁcations may be associated with brain dysfunction,
behavioral and metabolic deﬁciencies. The emerging evi-
dence of a microbiota-gut-brain axis dysregulation in
certain neuropsychiatric disorders warrants further clinical
and in vivo studies to investigate gut microbiotaetargeted
interventions as novel therapeutic strategies. Indeed, dietary
interventions to treat dysfunction of the gut-brain axis may
pose potential as therapeutic strategies for psychiatric dis-
orders. Gut microbiota abnormalities can also directly
induce clinical depression. Moreover, there exists rela-
tionship between the gut microbiota and the obesity via the
gut-microbiota axis. The associations established between
obesity and mental disorders (cognitive impairment and
mood and social behavioral alterations) could be related to
dietary induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota that,
in turn, may contribute to neuro-inﬂammation and dysre-
gulation of the neuroendocrine system associated with
obesity comorbid with mental impairments. Combining the
brain and gut brain will probably become the new tendency
of neuroscience, and targeting the gut microbiota will
possibly be a promising area for the therapy of mental
disorders and neurological diseases. The administration of
prebiotics and probiotics has shown promising results in
modulating the gut microbiome to correct the dysbiosis
both in animal and human studies. Although we still lack a
full understanding of the mechanisms by which microbiota
may inﬂuence the gut-brain axis and, thereby, brain func-
tion and behavior, studies have shed light on numerous
factors, including: regulation of the gut barrier, inﬂamma-
tion, and signaling through TLR that recognize bacterial
motifs and mediate in the communication with ENS,
regulation of enteroendocrine secretions and the HPA stress
response, and production and regulation of host neuro-
transmitter levels and their receptors. However, further
translational and functional studies are needed to progress
in the identiﬁcation of molecular targets/pathways that
could be favorably modulated by microbiota-based in-
terventions to help reduce obesity-associated complica-
tions. With the growing evidence, there is a great need to
explore further the exact mechanism of probiotics inﬂu-
encing the gut-brain axis that can eventually be a break-
through therapeutic modality of cognitive health.

inhibitors), FMT (fecal microbial transplant), FODMAPS
(fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols),
MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome), and others. As with
any innovation, there can be initial confusion, especially
when the science has yet to catch up with interventions that
are already being implemented; in this context, gut health is
no exception.
This chapter describes the history of microbiome
research, positioning this relatively new ﬁeld within the
context of the interrelationship between the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract and the brain, known as the Gut-Brain Axis. In so
doing, it explores known and putative mechanisms to
explain the bidirectional interactions clearly at play,
highlighting clinical examples where the microbiome, the
host intestinal epithelium, and its underlying immune
system impact human health and behavior. Although the
vagus nerve (VN) is an integral part of the bidirectional
communication network linking the gut and the brain, it is
not the only means by which the gut communicates with the
brain. Several other pathways directly link the brain and the
gut microbiota with the clinical signiﬁcance of this
becoming increasingly apparent [1,2].
Links
depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and immune
dysfunction have opened up new therapeutic options for
addressing such conditions [3]. Similarly, neurodegenerative
and inﬂammation-related brain conditions such as Parkinson
disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD), schizophrenia, and
autistic spectrum disorder are being considered within the
context of the gut-brain axis, similarly paving the way for
new therapeutic interventions [4].
As interventions, live probiotic supplements and to a
lesser extent prebiotics that support the growth of the
probiotic microbes are popular choices of both clinicians
and consumers across a range of conditions [5], even
though the evidence for beneﬁt in brain health remains
equivocal and many unanswered questions remain [6].
The human gut microbiomeda new
frontier in medicine
Until recently, the major determinant of the unique micro-
bial signature of an individual was believed to have been
encoded within the host’s genome [7]. However, it appears
that the genetics of the host plays a minor part, the major
determinant
being
environment.
Speciﬁcally,
microbiome is not signiﬁcantly associated with genetic
ancestry or with individual SNPs, and that previously
reported associations are not replicated across different
studies [8]. This is clinically very relevant because it sug-
gests that interventions to alter the environment of the
microbiome may be effectively conducted across diverse
genetic backgrounds.
The history of microbiome research
Contemporary readers may unwittingly think that the term
“microbiome” appeared relatively recently in the scientiﬁc
literature, especially since misattribution of the term to
Nobel Laureate microbiologist Joshua Lederberg in 2001
has been frequently requoted. In fact, the term “micro-
biome” ﬁrst appeared in 1962 when it was adopted in
conjunction with the incorporation of germ-free (GF) ani-
mals into common laboratory practice [9]. By 1988,
Whipps et al. had deﬁned the microbiome in a manner that
is largely in keeping with its modern usage in microbi-
ology: “A characteristic microbial community occupying a
reasonably well-deﬁned habitat which has distinct physico-
chemical properties. The term this way not only refers to
the microorganisms involved but also encompasses their
theatre of activity.” [10] Deﬁned in this manner, the
microbiome may be considered a key component of the gut
ecosystem, where the “theatre” also includes the host
epithelium and its underlying immune network.
Three decades later, our growing understanding of the
gut microbiome in human physiology has led to a dramatic
shift in the way we perceive the thousand or more microbial
taxonomic units that inhabit the gut lumen. Where the
intestinal lumen was once considered to be a temporary
repository for the wastes produced after food digestion and
nutrient absorption, the gut microbiome is now classiﬁed
by some as an organ in its own right [11].
The human microbiome projectdharnessing
modern lab technology
Following closely behind the completion of the Human
Genome Project (HGP) in 2003, the Human Microbiome
Project (HMP), which began in 2007, was seen to be a
logical, conceptual, and experimental extension [12].
The HGP leveraged advances in high-throughput DNA
sequencing technologies to extend the HGP research to the
human microbiome. One primary objective of the HMP is
to determine a reference genome for a human microbiome.
When such a reference genome has been determined, it is
considered possible to better characterize dysbiosis and
microbiome-related
either
health or disease [13].
With microbiome research no longer limited to culture-
based techniques, the understanding of its role in human
physiology has signiﬁcantly advanced with the conception
16s
rRNA
techniques
[14] in
1977, and
more
recently Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies
in 2005 [15]. Such techniques can explain at least in part,
the acceleration in the research being conducted in this
ﬁeld [16].
With the beneﬁt of further post-2007 research, it has
been subsequently considered that the characterization of a

“healthy” reference genome may no longer be a practical
deﬁnition; an alternative hypothesis is that of a healthy
“functional core” which comprises the metabolic and other
molecular functions performed by the microbiome in a
particular habitat but which is not necessarily provided by
the same microorganisms in different people [17].
The Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract
(MetaHIT) project was founded in 2008 and aimed to
sequence the microbial genomes of fecal samples derived
from both diseased (inﬂammatory bowel disease and
obesity) and healthy individuals with a view to better
understand the microbial links to disease [16].
Modern links between microbiome and human
An evolving awareness of the diverse roles of the micro-
biome and its symbiotic relationships with its human host
has resulted in a radical shift from thinking of microbes
solely in terms of pathogenicity to considering their
essentiality in normal human physiology [15]. The impact
of the resident gut microbes is now being extensively
researched in the context of a dysfunctional nervous system
where there is considerable overlap in the mechanistic
underpinnings of conditions described using the terms
neuroinﬂammatory [18], neuropsychiatric [4], and neuro-
degenerative diseases [19e21]. Mental health issues such
as depression and anxiety are the focus of intense research
into the links between the gut microbiome and immune
imbalances associated with uncontrolled inﬂammation
[3,4,20], as is the impact of psychosocial and physical
stress signaling systems linking the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract and central nervous system (CNS) [22].
What microorganisms constitute the gut
microbiome?
While the “gut microbiome” refers to the collective genome
of all the microorganisms inhabiting the human GI tract, the
organisms themselves are described collectively as the
“microbiota,” a dense and diverse population that includes
bacteria, bacteriophages, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and
archaea, with bacteria dominating [23].
The microbiota are not evenly distributed throughout the
GI tract, largely due to differences in host physiology at its
different functional levels. The colon, where luminal con-
tents reside for extended periods of time, exhibits the most
dense microbial population. Estimates of the number of
bacteria inhabiting the healthy human GI tract are 1013e1014
viable bacteria per gram of luminal content and collectively
contain at least 100-fold as many genes as does the entire
human genome [24]. The diverse bacterial population of the
human intestine is estimated to represent 50 different phyla,
1000 different species [23], and 7000 subspecies [25].
In this way, suggests Gill et al. [24], “humans are
superorganisms whose metabolism represents an amalgam-
ation of microbial and human attributes.”
Of the 50 or so phyla identiﬁed in the human GI tract,
four phyla dominate the densely populated colon: Firmi-
cutes (64%), Bacteroidetes (23%), Proteobacteria (8%), and
Actinobacteria (3%) [23].
Dysbiosis
Even though it is accepted that a balanced gut microbiota is
important for health, a so-called “normal” human micro-
biome has not yet been deﬁned [26]. The colon is domi-
nated by obligate anaerobes which is a likely consequence
of the severe oxygen limitation characteristic of this region
of the GI tract. Such obligate anaerobes ferment those diet-
derived carbohydrates that have escaped earlier digestion,
metabolizing them into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
including butyrate, a major signaling molecule in host
physiology. Oxygen deprivation with dominance of obli-
gate bacteria in the colon ensures production of metabolites
that maintain gut homeostasis [27,28].
Dysbiosis occurs when this pattern is disrupted by an
expansion of facultative anaerobes, typically belonging to
the Phylum Proteobacteria. Such disruption may be the
result of antibiotic or nonantibiotic pharmaceutical treatment
[29], which can eliminate epithelial hypoxia to drive the
shift of bacterial communities from obligate to facultative
anaerobes; this is considered the hallmark of dysbiosis [26].
Of clinical relevance is the observation that chronic
psychosocial stress in an animal model resulted in an expan-
sion of Proteobacteria [30]. In a human population, dysbiosis
together with increased Proteobacteria were associated with
the onset of cardiovascular events and are found in athero-
sclerotic plaques [31,32], suggesting that elevated Proteo-
bacteria may represent a “microbial signature” of disease [33].
Microbiome analysis
In keeping with a trend toward the development of clinical
strategies for personalized nutrition, identity of the micro-
bial population via a stool sample is available to both cli-
nicians and consumers from some laboratories. The reports
typically categorize the microorganisms into one of the four
dominant phyla, together with identiﬁcation at genus and
species level [34]. Although this form of testing is still in its
infancy and its value uncertain, there are those who regard
the information derived from microbiome research as the
key to better understanding human health and nutrition [35].
Linking the gut microbiome to the brain
The term “gut-brain axis” was ﬁrst mentioned in 1980 in
describing the existence of a mechanism relating plasma

cholecystokinin levels to cerebrospinal ﬂuid as a “gut to
brain axis” [36]. In the ensuing four decades, 1297 related
publications are indexed in PubMed, where 22 are clinical
trials and 601 are reviews (accessed 6th October 2019).
By 2014, it was suggested that the growing body of
information connecting human neurological function to
the host’s luminal microbiome required a reevaluation of
many concepts in health and disease; in short, a paradigm
shift would be necessary. The observed bidirectional
signaling between the gut and the brain was seen to
involve multiple mechanisms. These ﬁndings have resul-
ted in speculation that alterations in the gut microbiome
may play a pathophysiological role in human brain
diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety,
depression, and visceral and chronic pain [37] as well
as the neurodegenerative and other conditions mentioned
earlier.
Experimental work continues to show that brain devel-
opment is abnormal when the gut microbiome is absent
[38,39]. Furthermore, maternal and early-life nutrition play
a key role in establishing the microbiome and take place at
the same time as the occurrence of neurodevelopmental
plasticity, suggesting a complex dialogue between the GI
tract and the brain. Several lines of evidence show that the
gut microbiota interacts with diet, drugs, and stress, both
prenatally and postnatally [40].
Reference to this growing body of literature indicates
that human health can be both positively and negatively
impacted by the microbiota, not just in the GI tract but in
distant organs and systems.
The GI tract and its microbiome as an
ecosystem
No discussion of the microbiome would be complete
without consideration of the ecosystem to which it belongs.
As with land-based ecosystems, each component of the
human gut ecosystem is responsive to the continuously
changing conditions surrounding it, its survival dependent
on its ability to adapt to its ever-changing environment
[41]. Within the human GI tract, the intestinal epithelial
cells (IEC), their underlying immune network, and the
commensal microbiota are the major components of this
ecosystem [41]. The gut is equipped with a multilayered
biological system capable of maintaining homeostasis,
while at the same time, engaging in cross-talk between the
host and the microbial symbionts [42].
The host’s ﬁrst line of defense consists of enterocytes
interspersed with specialized cells together with overlying
mucous layers to restrict intrusion of potentially reactive
antigens and undesirable luminal microorganisms. Its
second line of defense is dependent on the underlying
immune cells of the innate and acquired immune systems,
an important role being to distinguish between beneﬁcial
and pathological antigens; in so doing, its exerts tolero-
genic responses to the commensal microbes [42].
Investigation into the bidirectional nature of the host-
microbe relationship indicates that the composition of the
human microbiota is determined by an interaction of host
genetics and diet with an environment that includes
chemicals such as antibiotics [43].
It seems, however, that on average, the genetic differ-
ences between humans within a population are too small to
outweigh diet as a determinant of microbiome composition
[34].
Nevertheless,
preponderance
therapeutic
inventions directed at restoring homeostasis to the gut
ecosystem is focused on the administration of probiotic
supplements
without
targeted
interventions
aimed
restoring the defensive functions of the specialized enter-
ocyte [44].
How the microbiota shift rapidly with dietary
change
To illustrate the rapid and dynamic way in which gut
ecology can shift, a 2014 study [45] showed that when
humans were switched between a plant-based and an
animal-based diet in a 4-day intervention, the composition
of the microbiota changed signiﬁcantly in accordance with
the changes in macronutrient proportions. The participants
on the carnivore-style diet increased their dietary fat
approximately twofold, whereas those on the herbivore-
style diet increased their plant carbohydrate approxi-
mately threefold.
Those participants consuming the plant-based diet
increased their levels of the Firmicutes that metabolize
polysaccharides; in so doing, the proportions of butyrate-
producing Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale, and Rumino-
coccus bromii signiﬁcantly increased, an advantage for the
colonocytes for which butyrate is the preferred energy
source.
By contrast, the animal-based diet, naturally higher in
dietary fat, increased bile secretion, promoting the growth
of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophila wadsworthia,
Alistipes, and Bacteroides [45]. The abundance and activity
of B. wadsworthia on the animal-based diet was considered
to support a link between dietary fat, bile acids, and the
outgrowth
microorganisms
capable
triggering
inﬂammatory bowel disease. This has clinical implications
for those individuals trialing the many popular “branded”
dietsdKetogenic, Paleolithic, Carnivore, low-FODMAP as
examples; each of these is based on signiﬁcant changes in
the proportions of animal versus plant food, macronutri-
ents, prebiotics, and other ﬁbers [46].
The symbiotic relationship between the microbiota and
the IECs forms an ecosystem where the host provides the


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 212

microbes with a suitable physical environment, required
nutrients, and prebiotics that can be metabolized to provide
the host with beneﬁcial signaling molecules. The microbes
in turn, provide the host with essential nutrients, immune-
modulating signals, and some antimicrobial activities. In
this way, both commensal and exogenous probiotic bacteria
interact with the host to maintain homeostasis [47]. In this
regard, a Systems Biology model has been proposed that
posits circular communication loops amid the brain, gut,
and gut microbiome and that perturbation at any level can
propagate dysregulation throughout the circuit [6].
As the science continues to unfold, it becomes clear that
intricate signaling and cross-talk between the microbes and
their human hosts is joining the dots in our understanding
of why the presence of a diverse microbiota beneﬁts not
just digestive health but assists in driving the processes of
health or disease in distant organs, including the nervous
system [48].
How germ-free animals help elucidate the
To study host-microbial interactions in health and disease,
GF rodents are being used increasingly as a relevant model
[49]. For example, when GF animals are subsequently
colonized
commensal
microorganisms,
complex
signaling pathways have been shown to result in the
expression of genes encoding tight-junction (TJ) proteins;
as a result, the mucosal barrier can be enhanced [50].
Perhaps
counter-intuitively,
studies
GF
animal
models have demonstrated that mice lacking gut microbiota
are resistant to diet-induced obesity, liver steatosis, and
insulin resistance and that an etiologic mechanism associ-
ated with the effects of endotoxin can be advanced [51].
Studies using GF animals are equally valuable as a
means of comparing the inﬂuence of the microbiota on the
gut-brain axis [20]. For example, the investigation of
anxiety-like and depressionlike behaviors in GF compared
with normal animals indicates that responses to physical or
psychosocial stresses are linked to the presence or absence
of the microbiota [52,53]. Further research along these lines
showed that the low-anxiety phenotype was accompanied
by long-term changes in genes associated with plasticity in
the hippocampus and amygdala of these animals [54]. What
is further evolving in this line of evidence is that the impact
on animal behavior is speciﬁc to the bacterial species
employed to colonize the GF animals [20].
Compared with conventionally raised animals, when
microorganisms are absent from the intestines of GF mice,
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is more permeable to
macromolecules, mediated by reduced expression of key
tight-junction proteins in the brain endothelial cells. When
GF animals were either colonized or administered the
SCFA fermentation metabolite, butyrate, the gut became
less permeable and the barrier enhanced [55].
In a similar way, long-term antibiotic treatment of mice
diminishes the gut microbiota and is sufﬁcient to decrease
neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult mice, impairing
their ability to recognize objects [56]. Interestingly, these
phenotypes could be rescued with probiotics and voluntary
exercise as the intervention. Neurogenesis can also be
promoted by serotonin, with the gut bacteria shown to play
a role in serotonergic pathways in both the gut and the
brain [57].
These few examples illustrate the essential intercon-
nectedness of the microbiota and neural function.
Shifting the therapeutic emphasis from
the probiotic toward the host
Development of a healthy gut mucosa is a bidirectional

Even so, it appears that current therapeutic strategies to
restore gut homeostasis are mostly reliant on manipulation
of the microbiota using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics,
phage therapy, polyphenols, and fecal microbiota trans-
plantation, rather than approaches that target the host
epithelial cells and their underlying immune network
[59,60].

Furthermore, these authors claim that because the hu-
man immune system already has mechanisms to balance

anism for therapeutic means could provide an alternative to
targeting the microbes themselves for remediation of
dysbiosis.

Where the popular current focus on addressing dys-
biosis is on manipulating the microbiota with antimicro-
bials, pro- and prebiotics, it may be time to shift the
emphasis closer to optimizing enterocyte and colonocyte
metabolism as the primary drivers of dysbiosis in the colon.
In support of this hypothesis, evidence exists that the
IECs engage endogenous mechanisms that include but are
not limited to the synthesis of protective mucus by
specialized Goblet Cells, the synthesis and release of
secretory IgA by plasma cells, the production of selective
antimicrobial peptides by Paneth cells, neurotransmitter
synthesis by enterochromafﬁn cells, together with synthesis
and release of a number of hormones by the enter-
oendocrine cells [63].
In addition, IECs contain sophisticated monitoring
systems that include tolllike receptors and dendritic cells to
detect possible threats to which healthy epithelial cells can
respond [63].
In the context of the gut-brain axis, enhanced thera-
peutic strategies to restore homeostasis in the gut ecosystem
may, in turn, lead to better clinical outcomes in conditions
associated with CNS dysfunction.
The intestinal epithelial cell
The single layer of IECs lining all anatomical hollow
spaces share many common properties; even so, each is
specialized to respond to its local environment. Although
the IECs in this regard line the luminal surface from
esophagus to anus, the types of cells differ regionally to
accommodate the many different conditions within the
human GI tract (Fig. 14.1).
Notably, comparison of the intestinal epithelium in the
small intestine and that of the colon shows marked differ-
ences which are related to the requirements at each intes-
tinal region. The small intestine is primarily involved in
digestion and absorption and is contiguous with a relatively
low microbial population, whereas a more dense microbial
population occupies the colon, where fermentation of those
carbohydrates that escape digestion within the small
intestine is a key function [62].
IECs are continuously replaced every 4e5 days through
a process of renewal and migration, initiated by maturation
of the stem cells at the base of the villus crypt [64]. As the
cells mature, they progress upwards along the villi, differ-
entiating as they mature. The differentiated cells include

The intestinal epithelium and its various specialized cell types. The single layer of mucin-protected cells described as the “intestinal
epithelium” is contiguous with the immune network of the Lamina propria on the systemic side and the microbiota on the luminal side. A complex array of
differentiated cell types and intricate signaling pathways are integral to the ability of this epithelium to maintain homeostasis in a continuously hostile
environment.

enterocytes as the most abundant of these cells; the major
functions of the major specialized gut epithelial cells are
brieﬂy described below.
Goblet cells
Goblet cells secrete mucins to protect and lubricate, making
up around 10% of the total IECs and recognized as signiﬁ-
cant contributors to barrier maintenance [64]. In addition to
the secretion of mucin as a primary component of innate
immune defenses, goblet cells secrete antimicrobial proteins,
chemokines, and cytokines demonstrating functions in
innate immunity beyond barrier maintenance [65].
Paneth cells
Of particular note are the small intestinal Paneth cells
which protect the stem cells in the base of the crypt and
which release a range of antimicrobial compounds [66].
well-studied
defensins
tolerogenic
toward
commensal microbes but are potent antimicrobials toward
pathogens, making them useful therapeutic targets for
addressing dysbiosis [66].
Enteroendocrine cells
Enteroendocrine
(EECs)
found
scattered
throughout the epithelium of the GI tract from the stomach
to the rectum. EECs release gut hormones in response to
meal-related stimuli and thereby exert actions ranging from
the local control of gut motility and secretion to the regu-
lation of insulin release and food intake. EECs are tradi-
tionally classiﬁed according to the principal hormone they
produce. Some hormones, such as serotonin (5-HT), are
produced along the whole length of the gut, playing
important roles in motility [67].
Enterochromafﬁn cells are an EEC subtype (<1% of
total intestinal epithelia) which produce >90% of the
body’s serotonin and have been suggested to affect a
variety of physiological and pathophysiological states. As
such, they play a signiﬁcant role in GI motility and the
migrating motor complex, as well as nausea and visceral
hypersensitivity [68e70].
IEC signaling molecules
In addition, IECs carry a number of surface molecules
capable of detecting the presence of pathogens. These
surface molecules are typically proteins and classiﬁed as
Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). The PRRs fall into
two groupsdthe Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns
(PAMPs)
detect
chemical
signatures
microorganisms and the Damage-Associated Molecular
Patterns (DAMPs) which detect antigens and other
potential toxins. PAMPs and DAMPs both alert the IECs
to potential threats, with resultant signaling mechanisms
initiating the appropriate range of responses designed to
protect the host [71].
In a complex interconnectedness, the IECs which are
sandwiched between the gut lumen and the underlying
immune cells operate as sensors to signals from both the
host immune cells and the gut microbes, mediating the
balance between secreting cytokines, chemokines, and
hormones [62].
Dendritic cells
As components of the intestinal epithelium, dendritic cells
(DCs) are central to the initiation of primary immune
responses. They are the only antigen-presenting cells
capable of stimulating naive T cells, and hence they are
pivotal in the generation of adaptive immunity [72]. DCs
can promote the development of regulatory T cells (Treg)
with inﬂammation-suppressive activity. The induction of
tolerogenic DCs can be achieved by vitamin D receptor
agonists, known to shape DC phenotype and function and
as such are targets for pharmaceutical research, especially
related to autoimmunity [73].
The gut barrier
An appropriately dynamic gut barrier is critical to the
maintenance and restoration of intestinal homeostasis. On
the one hand, IECs must provide absorptive surfaces that
allow the entry of water and nutrients; while on the other
hand, they must be capable of excluding microbes and
antigens, most of which are food-derived. Furthermore,
the gut functions with the continuous challenge of
responding to pathogens while remaining relatively unre-
sponsive to commensal microﬂora, food proteins, and
other antigens [74].
Collectively, healthy IECs provide an essential and
selective intestinal barrier and in large part, determine gut
homeostasis. The gut barrier is primarily composed of the
continuous single-celled layer of IECs, a protective
mucous overlay, and the underlying lamina propria (LP)
[75]. The LP resides below the IECs and houses the
majority of the cells involved in immune responses. Cells
of the LP are conveniently located in close proximity to
the surface epithelium and also to the surrounding vessels
and nerve ﬁbers, suggesting strong functional associations
with both [76].
The blood-brain barrier
The BBB, which is comprised of endothelial cells, astro-
cytes, pericytes, and adjacent neurons, regulates the pas-
sage of essential components into and out of the CNS,
minimizing
inﬂuence
toxic

pathogens [77]. This may include pathogens which have
crossed the intestinal barrier and carried by the circulation
to the CNS.
As with the epithelial cells of the GI tract, the TJ
backbone in brain endothelial cells consists of trans-
membrane proteins (occludins, claudins, and junctional
adhesion molecules [78]) which regulate the passage of
molecules in and out of the CNS [79]. BBB dysfunction
can contribute to neurological disorders in a passive way by
vascular leakage of blood-borne molecules into the CNS
and in an active way by guiding the migration of inﬂam-
matory cells into the CNS [80].
The source of the inﬂammatory cytokines carried
systemically to the CNS may have been generated by
perturbations at the gut-immune interface, providing a
speciﬁc link between the gut ecosystem and the brain [81].
A number of CNS inﬂammation-related disorders, such as
multiple sclerosis, human immunodeﬁciency, virus infec-
tion, or AD, have been linked to the production of
proinﬂammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteases, and
reactive oxygen species, which adversely affect CNS
barriers [81].
The tight junctiondeffects of exogenous
An essential component of the intestinal barrier is the
paracellular junction that connects the IECs to each other.
The TJ is a complex mechanism that is somewhat analo-
gous to a spring-loaded hinged gate with several types of
latches that allow it to open and close. The environment-
responsive molecules, occludins, claudins, and JAM
proteins act as the latches, with zonulin acting as the
spring. The role of the TJs is to regulate the paracellular
permeability, allowing the “gate” to open and close as
required. When this mechanism is perturbed, the gut
barrier is compromised and intestinal permeability is
increased, allowing entry of unwanted molecules and/or
microbes.
The term, “leaky gut” has crept into popular vernacular
and misrepresents the dynamic nature of the gut barrier;
consequently, interventions to address the issue clinically
are often inappropriate in that the layperson believes that
the gut barrier is akin to there being holes in a pipe that
must be “sealed.” Gluten is widely considered within the
lay community to be the primary dietary factor responsible
for destabilizing the gut barrier. This notion, together with
that promoted in a widely publicized book [82] claiming an
association between wheat intake and adiposity, has led to
the growing trend of gluten avoidance behavior in many
countries, even when celiac disease is not present [83,84].
Both dietary factors and endogenous metabolic factors
[85] provide the signals known to inﬂuence the components
of the TJs. Gluten research conﬁrms its role in destabilizing
zonulin and thereby in opening the TJs; however, it is just
one factor of many [86]. It is noteworthy that many of the
additives and processing aids being used in producing
gluten-free foods with the appearance, taste, and mouth-feel
of the gluten-containing original have been shown to
adversely affect gut barrier integrity [87]. Enzymes such as
transglutaminase together with a number of commonly
used emulsiﬁers have been identiﬁed as having destabiliz-
ing effects on the gut barrier and in some cases thought to
contribute to a rise in autoimmune conditions [88].
The tight junctiondendogenous mechanisms
As described earlier, perturbation of the gut barrier is
considered to be typically the result of reactions from
microbes and food-derived molecules in the gut lumen;
however, more recently it has become apparent that there
are other factors which play a signiﬁcant role in destabi-
lizing the gut barrier as well as the BBB (Fig. 14.2).
Redox-inﬂammation
Redox signaling has been shown to tightly modulate the
inﬂammatory response, whereas tissue damage subsequent
to unregulated inﬂammation generates more reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS)
[89]. The simultaneous presence of both perturbed redox
and inﬂammation homeostasis acts as a feed-forward pro-
cess to promote a dysfunctional barrier.
When redox-dependent signal transduction mechanism
such as this occurs within the gut ecosystem, components
of the TJ such as occludin adversely impact the gut barrier
[90]. Oxidative stress has been suggested to act as an
initiator and/or mediator of many human diseases and
because the cerebral vasculature is particularly susceptible
to oxidative stress, the maintenance of the BBB is a critical
factor in maintaining CNS homeostasis [91].
Alkaline phosphatase
Another biomolecule produced by the healthy host is
intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), an endogenous protein
expressed by the intestinal epithelium, and believed to play
a vital role in maintaining gut homeostasis and wellbeing
[92]. Loss of IAP expression or function is associated with
intestinal
inﬂammation,
dysbiosis,
bacterial
translocation, and subsequently systemic inﬂammation.
Its expression is known to be affected by prematurity,
starvation, and inﬂammation. IAP’s antiinﬂammatory effect
is associated with inhibition of toxic microbial ligands such
as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Its ability to degrade
LPS and other toxic ligands is essential in protecting the
host from sepsis during acute inﬂammation and chronic
inﬂammatory conditions such as inﬂammatory bowel dis-
ease [93].


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 216

Of importance is the fact that this protective effect does
not occur in GF animals [92]. However, oral supplemen-
tation with IAP in mice improves gut barrier function and
prevents luminal proinﬂammatory factors from gaining
access to the circulation. Mechanistically, IAP treatment
preserved the localization of the ZO-1 and Occludin pro-
teins of the TJ during inﬂammation, and as such, was also
associated with improved epithelial barrier function [94].
Hyperglycemia
Utilizing animal models of obesity and hyperglycemia, it
has been shown that hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier
permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional
reprogramming of IECs and alteration of TJ integrity [95].
Related ﬁndings included the observation that the genes
most affected by hyperglycemia were those associated with
TJ dynamics and also that glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) levels as a measure of longer-term hyperglycemia
correlated with microbial inﬂux of both pathogens and
commensal microbes.
In turn, hyperglycemia-mediated barrier disruption
allowed the systemic inﬂux of microbial products with
associated enteric infection; reversal of these effects
occurred when hyperglycemia was corrected. By this
mechanism, a hyperglycemic environment favors immune
dysfunction with diabetic patients especially susceptible
to infections and with measurably impaired neutrophil
function, humoral immunity, antioxidant defenses, urinary
antibacterial activity, and GI and urinary motility [96].
Circadian rhythm
Another factor that signiﬁcantly impacts the gut ecosystem
is circadian rhythm. The human biological clock is a
remarkable built-in mechanism, which works according to
the Earth’s rotation and to variations in light, temperature,
and environment to create a 24-h rhythm [97]. Originally
identiﬁed in the brain, the circadian clock system has since
been found in the GI tract. Whereas light controls the
brain’s central clock, meal timing has profound effects on
the intestinal peripheral clock. This clock serves as a cue
for rhythmic setting of absorption, epithelial renewal, and
barrier functions. Related effects have been identiﬁed in
Mast cells as key effector cells of allergic reactions and
which have been shown to display diurnal variation [97].
Furthermore, not only are daylight and food intake
involved in circadian control of gut homeostasis but such
control is also responsive to microbial metabolites, adding
to the library of intricate signaling mechanisms associated
with gut homeostasis [98]. There is now a growing
understanding that permeability at the BBB is also
dynamically controlled by circadian rhythms and sleep. In
addition, sleep promotes the clearance of metabolites along
the BBB, with these mechanisms implicated in brain
diseases including epilepsy [99].
FIGURE 14.2
Key factors contributing to gut barrier integrity. Through its tight junctions, the gut barrier is impacted by numerous exogenous
factors that include food, environmental toxins, and microbes and their metabolites. It is signiﬁcantly impacted by endogenous factors associated with
inﬂammation, oxidative stress, circadian rhythms, and poor metabolic control. Hyperglycemia is directly correlated with poor gut barrier function

How intestinal microbes communicate
with the host
A number of host mechanisms bidirectionally connect the
gut ecosystem and distant organs including the brain. These
pathways communicate neurally via the VN and spinal
cord, as well as via an endocrine link through the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). However, there
are three other pathways that involve neurotransmitters,
cytokine signaling (immune) and microbial metabolites
such as the SCFA (metabolic); degradation products of the
amino acid, L-tryptophan also impact (Fig. 14.3).
In addition, the potential pathogenicity or toler-
ogenicity of the microbes of the gut lumen is detected by
various monitoring systems within the gut epithelium and
its associated immune cells within the LP [73,100]. A key
property
lumen
microbes
they
continuously “converse” with the immune system via the
IECs. Notably, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
engage
“conversations.”
IECs
naturally
recognize and interact with commensal bacteria and give
instructions to the underlying mucosal immune cells to
“initiate an immunological balance between active and
quiescent conditions, to eventually establish intestinal
homeostasis” [63].
Bacteria inhabiting the GI tract interact with human
cells via one of the PRRs, namely the tolllike receptor
(TLR). TLR2 plays an important role in enabling cells of
the innate immune system to recognize conserved structural
motifs on the surface of a wide array of bacteria [101],
playing a major role in gram-positive bacterial recognition
[102]. TLR2 is the recognition site for peptidoglycans and
lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on the wall of gram-positive
bacteria, whereas TLR4 recognizes endotoxin or lipopoly-
saccharide
(LPS)
gram-negative
bacteria.
receptors are the initiating step in cytokine synthesis and
are widely expressed in cells throughout the body,
including the neurons [103].
FIGURE 14.3
The gut-brain axis. The gut and the brain communicate bidirectionally via several pathways which include; neural via the vagus nerve,
endocrine via the HPA axis, immune via cytokines, metabolic via microbially generated short-chain fatty acids and via neurotransmitters, some of
which are synthesized by microbes.

## Page 218

At ﬁrst thought to be associated only with inﬂammatory
disease, TLR4 is now known to play a signiﬁcant role in
noninfectious and chronic disease. TLR4 is present on the
surface of both hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells
including endothelial cells, cardiac monocytes, and cells of
the CNS [104], suggesting that this mechanism may impact
other physiological systems as a predisposing process to
initiating chronic disease.
In the context of the gut-brain axis, TLR4 is expressed
on vagal afferent ﬁbers such that these ﬁbers can sense
bacterial products to activate the brain [105]. LPS can also
directly activate vagal afferent ﬁbers [106].
From dysfunctional gut ecology to chronic
As mentioned in the “How germ-free animals help
elucidate the mechanisms section,” animals lacking gut
microbiota are resistant to diet-induced obesity, liver stea-
tosis, and insulin resistance, supporting a concept that the
gut microbiota contribute signiﬁcantly to the development
of impaired insulin sensitivity and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) [51]. The multifactorial nature of this
association may include the ability of the microbiota to
generate toxins such as LPS.
Since insulin resistance leads to an inability of the
system to appropriately regulate glucose, the blood
biomarker HbA1c becomes elevated. As HbA1c was
shown earlier to contribute to impairment of the gut
barrier TJs, a feed-forward loop is generated, allowing
inﬂux of LPS and antigens. Fig. 14.4 graphically illus-
trates the process.
LPS, neurobehavioral and neurodegenerative
Although serum LPS is present in the bloodstream of all
healthy individuals, it is found to be elevated in patients
with conditions such as severe autism, liver cirrhosis,
diabetes, aging, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, AD, and
chronic infection, especially sepsis [107]. It is similarly
elevated in a dose-related manner in neurobehavioral
conditions by depressing mood, increasing anxiety, and
impairing long-term memory; in each case, acute systemic
inﬂammatory markers are also elevated [108].
Linking the VN to gut ecosystem
communication
Of the mechanisms by which the gut and brain communi-
cate, the neural mechanisms play a key role. The VN is
considered to be at the interface of the gut-brain axis,
communicating through the autonomic nervous system
(Fig. 14.3). A perturbation of this axis is associated with the
pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenera-
tive, and neuropsychiatric disorders [109,110]. Likewise,
abnormal vagal tone is observed in inﬂammatory and
motility disorders of the bowel [111,112].
FIGURE 14.4
The intricate bidirectional mechanisms between the gut ecosystem and systemic organs as the primary driver of cardiometabolic
disease. Gut barrier dysfunction and glucose dysregulation drive metabolic disease in a self-perpetuating loop. When the gut barrier is impaired, LPS has
two primary effects; (1) entry via the paracellular spaces to the bloodstream and (2) initiation of the synthesis of inﬂammatory cytokines. LPS travels via
the bloodstream to the liver where it attaches to TLR4 to initiate inﬂammation with subsequent hepatic damage. Such damage leads to insulin resistance
and elevated HbA1c. In turn, HbA1c further impacts the gut barrier, further contributing to inﬂux of LPS and antigens.

Of the cranial nerves, the parasympathetic VN is a
mixed nerve with antiinﬂammatory properties and is made
up of 80% afferent and 20% efferent ﬁbers. In this way, the
VN can sense microbial metabolites and transfer this
information via its afferent ﬁbers to the CNS from which it
can generate an appropriate response [2]. Vagal afferent
ﬁbers are distributed to all levels of the GI tract wall but do
not cross the epithelial layer; they are therefore not in direct
contact with the luminal microbiota and can only indirectly
sense signals from the microbiota [2].
Both dysbiosis and stress are associated with irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) and inﬂammatory bowel disease
(IBD), with stress stimulating the sympathetic nervous
system while inhibiting the VN [113]. It is not yet known
whether the dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of an
abnormal gut-brain response [114,115].
Stimulation of the VN which is an approved therapy for
epilepsy and depression may also have potential to restore
gut homeostasis [2].
Other biochemical inﬂuences on neural
function in the gut-brain axis
Extending the roles of neurotransmitters
To support the classical roles of the neurotransmitters in
the CNS, a signiﬁcant role for epinephrine (E), norepi-
nephrine
(NE),
(DA),
5-HT
physiology has been identiﬁed. In this capacity, they are
associated with major functions of the GI tract; motility,
nutrient absorption, innate immune function, and the
microbiome [116]. Where neurotransmitter levels are
dysregulated in pathological conditions such as IBD and
PD, modulators within the gut-brain axis appear to be
potential therapeutic targets [117].
In the era of the microbiome, the classical role of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as antide-
pressants is being challenged in that their effect in the brain
may not be their only target [22]. Interestingly, in animals
following a subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, SSRIs lose their
ability to relieve depressionlike symptoms. This suggests
that VN-dependent gut-brain signaling contributes to the
effects of oral SSRIs, highlighting the therapeutic potential
for vagal stimulation as an alternative treatment of mood
disorders [118] but in also highlighting the clinical
relevance of addressing gut ecology in patients presenting
with depressive illness [119].
High comorbidities exist between psychiatric symp-
toms such as anxiety (via the HPA) and GI tract disorders
such as IBS [120]. In the same way, there is demonstrable
comorbidity between the neurodevelopmental and psy-
chiatric impairment seen in autistic spectrum disorder and
GI tract dysfunction [121].
Synthesis of neurotransmitters and effects on
the host
A detailed discussion of the pathways associated with
neurotransmitter synthesis is beyond the scope of this
review. However, not only does the host have the ability to
synthesize its essential neurotransmitters but the bacteria
also have this capability. Individual bacterial species have
been identiﬁed for their ability to increase the levels of the
neurotransmitters
dopamine,
noradrenaline,
serotonin,
gamma-amino butyric acid, acetylcholine, histamine, and
others [122], complicating the clinician’s ability to deter-
mine the primary disease drivers in individual case
presentations.
Serotonindunraveling the complexities
The role of the microbiota in inﬂuencing neurotransmitter
levels adds a new level of complexity to our understanding
of disease-generating mechanisms. Serotonin has been the
focus of extensive gut-brain axis research aiming to
unravel distinct mechanisms at the level of the gut and the
brain separately, as well as those associated with their
interrelationship.
Approximately 95% of the body’s serotonin is produced
by the EECs of the gut [123] where the synthetic pathways
are identical to those in the brain and wherein the amino
acid L-tryptophan is the substrate for synthesis via the rate-
limiting enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase [117].
Following immune activation or the stress response,
L-tryptophan can be metabolized to produce either kynurenine
or quinolinic acid, neither of which can cross the BBB if
produced outside the brain, whereas L-tryptophan can cross
[123]. Quinolinic acid is neurotoxic when produced within the
brain, whereas kynurenine is neuroprotective. It has recently
been shown that the gut microbiota regulate which of
the competing metabolic pathways will dominate metabolism
of L-tryptophan and the consequent effects on cognitive and
GI tract functions [124].
Upstream factors in neural function
Induction of cellular defense mechanisms. In addition to the
foregoing discussion of the role of the microbiota in brain
function, this chapter would be incomplete without reference
to the upstream biochemical factors that govern cellular
function. Human cells rely on a range of endogenous
mechanisms that govern their ability to defend themselves
against various assaults and to maintain homeostasis. The
transcription factor Nrf2 is signiﬁcant in that its activation,
typically by an environmental, exogenous, or dietary stressor,
leads to the induction of several hundred genes associated
with core processes related to cellular defense [125].


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 220

Nrf2 is activated by a variety of factors which include
exercise and diet-derived bioactives [126]. Numerous
phytochemicals can activate Nrf2 but many are of such low
bioavailability that it is doubtful that they can individually
reach sufﬁcient intracellular micromolar concentration to
impact gene expression, although in combination the effect
may be different [127].
Nrf2 is sometimes described as “a multi-organ protec-
tor,” “the master redox switch,” and “a guardian of health
span and gatekeeper of species longevity.” These terms are
indicative of its signiﬁcance in cellular homeostasis. The
crucifer-derived phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) is the
most potent naturally occurring Nrf2 activator with an
absolute bioavailability of around 80% [128]. Its diversity
of application in humans is illustrated in a number of
clinical trials across a diverse array of conditions [129].
The role of BH4 in neurotransmitter synthesis
A lesser-known property of Nrf2 is that it is associated with
synthesis of dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, seroto-
nin, and melatonin.
Just as serotonin is synthesized from L-tryptophan via
tryptophan hydroxylase, dopamine is synthesized from the
amino acid L-tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.
Both enzymes require the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4). The amino acid L-phenylalanine can be converted to
L-tyrosine via another BH4-dependent enzyme, phenylala-
nine hydroxylase. These enzymes are readily inactivated by
oxidation, suggesting that an oxidative cellular environment
may impair the synthesis of these neurotransmitters [130].
BH4 is also the cofactor for nitric oxide synthases
(NOS); however, inadequate BH4 leads to uncoupling of
NOS and the production of highly oxidative radicals,
thereby impairing the activity of the hydroxylases [131].
BH4 is synthesized by the rate-limiting enzyme GTP
cyclohydrolase 1, an enzyme that is regulated by Nrf2, a
key mediator of the antioxidant response. Activation of
Nrf2 to induce expression of the gene coding for GTP
cyclohydrolase 1 may simultaneously restore redox status.
Dopamine is highly susceptible to oxidative assault and
in PD, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, there is
selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra. Quinone reductase, an enzyme encoded by the Nrf2
target gene, and NADPH:oxidoreductase (NQO1) effec-
tively protect dopaminergic cells. SFN acts as a potent
activator of Nrf2 and an NQO1 inducer protects neurons
and nonneuronal cells [132].
The role of BDNF in neurological function
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is abundantly
and widely expressed in the nervous system and is involved
in regulating the growth of neurons, neurogenesis, and
neuroplasticity [133]. Of relevance here is its role in
regulating the epithelial TJ proteins to enhance barrier
function, even in the presence of inﬂammatory cytokines
[134]. In an animal study, antimicrobials altered the
BDNF
independent
inﬂammatory activity, changes in levels of gastrointestinal
neurotransmitters and vagal or sympathetic integrity.
The authors concluded that the dysregulated microbiota
intestinal
dysbiosis
might
contribute
to psychiatric disorders in patients with bowel disorders
[135].
An additional property of BDNF is its ability to
activate Nrf2 and its target genes. The signiﬁcance of this
was demonstrated in a model wherein depressed animals
with low hippocampal BDNF levels exhibited decreased
nuclear translocation of Nrf2, leading to a state of
persistent oxidative stress. These results reveal a novel
role for BDNF in controlling redox homeostasis because
activating Nrf2 translocation restored redox homeostasis
and reversed vulnerability to depression [136].
Because BDNF can modulate both the neuronal redox
environment and epithelial barrier function, it would be
clinically useful to know how to enhance it. Acute
low-intensity exercise was shown, in an animal study,
to activate hippocampal BDNF expression, supporting
the role of appropriate exercise in human health [137].
Nutrition-speciﬁc requirements of the
host and its microbiota
Nourishing the host cells
Human nutrition is an established science that aims to
provide for the needs of humans in different environments
and across different stages of the life cycle. However, the
evolving discussion around the role of the microbiota in the
GI ecosystem adds a new dimension to the science of
human nutrition.
In aiming to restore homeostasis to the gut ecosystem,
the host diet should optimize macro- and micronutrient
intake for the IECs and their underlying immune network,
ensuring that protein is of appropriate quality to supply
L-glutamine for the enterocytes of the small intestine,
especially since an inﬂamed small intestine has a heavy
demand for this nonessential amino acid [138].
In line with the earlier discussion on the multiple roles
of Nrf2 in core cellular processes, a diverse array of
phytochemicals including SFN-yielding vegetables is
recommended [139,140]. SFN’s ability to readily cross
the BBB may partly explain its neuroprotective effects in
a range of neurological conditions [141].

Nourishing the microbiota
The symbiotic relationship that exists between the micro-
biota and the human host is evident when considering the
nutrient requirements of each. Essentially, the host provides
food for the microbes, which in turn consume that food to
produce metabolites necessary for the health of the host;
generated primarily in the colon, the SCFAs are the most
important of these.
Dietary fat
As discussed earlier, the macronutrient composition of the
host diet has a major and rapid impact on the diversity and
relative proportions of microbes inhabiting the GI tract. A
diet high in fat, especially saturated fat, is associated with
reduced microbial diversity, and in a 6-month randomized
controlled trial of healthy young adults, an unfavorable
shift to gram-negative microbial species with abnormal
metabolic biomarkers was observed [142]. The known
adverse effects of a high-fat diet on the host also adversely
impact the microbiota.
Dietary protein
High relative protein intake inﬂuences the microbiota,
promoting the proliferation of bile-tolerant species, while
decreasing the abundance of the saccharolytic microbes
required to metabolize nondigestible carbohydrates that
escape enzymatic digestion in the small intestine [45].
Dietary indigestible prebiotics
A range of carbohydrate foods, insoluble ﬁbers, resistant
starches, and polyphenols are metabolized by the micro-
biota, each inﬂuencing microbial composition. The major
SCFA metabolites acetate, butyrate, and propionate are the
result of microbial fermentation of dietary ﬁber, with
butyrate preferred by the colonocyte.
These metabolites act as signaling molecules that sup-
ply energy to the colonocytes in particular, improving the
intestinal environment and directly affecting various host
peripheral tissues [143]. The SCFAs act as signal trans-
duction molecules via G-protein coupled receptors on target
cells and also as epigenetic regulators of gene expression
by the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) [143].
Because SCFAs cross the BBB, there is considerable
interest in dietary interventions that favor production of
SCFAs in order to target key inﬂammatory pathways.
These pathways are dysregulated in cardiovascular disease,
type II diabetes, and systemic inﬂammation and are
consistently linked to an attenuated lifespan in schizo-
phrenia [144].
The effects of SCFAs on brain health are a new area of
research with little available human evidence. However, a
2018 animal study investigated the direct effect of SCFAs
on behaviors associated with psychosocial stress. The
intervention increased responsiveness to an acute stressor
and exhibited behavioral test-speciﬁc antidepressant and
anxiolytic effects [145].
How does nature maintain the gut-
microbiome-brain axis?
The host cells
In addressing the IEC as a primary target, mechanisms to
maintain homeostasis of these cells and their underlying
cells are a key consideration. The range of exogenous and
endogenous factors governing the integrity of the gut
barrier is critical to this process.
As the science of redox homeostasis has evolved, it
has become clear that the Free Radical-Antioxidant theory
of the past was just too simplistic and that high doses of
direct-acting antioxidant vitamins in particular can inhibit
the cell’s protective responses by masking nutrigenomic
signals [146]. The role of Nrf2 in inducing the expression
of hundreds of protective genes as a primary defensive
mechanism would appear to better explain the endoge-
nous mechanisms that have sustained human life for
millennia, to a large extent as the response to diet and
exercise [147].
Although the polyphenols per se exhibit very low
bioavailability, the metabolites produced by microbial
fermentation are independently bioactive [127]. A diet
rich in a wide variety of plant foods exhibits signiﬁcant
activation of Nrf2 as a result of the additive effect of
many such foods. The importance of plant foods in
modulating redox-inﬂammation status was investigated in
a clinical trial where young adults were asked to consume
different quantities of plant food over 30 days. Bio-
markers of inﬂammation, CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and
others, together with homocysteine were signiﬁcantly
lowered by a diet containing >660 g of (nonorganic)
vegetables daily [139].
It is likely that the same or greater quantity of vege-
tables simultaneously upregulated Nrf2, although that was
not measured. In an era in which it may not be possible to
persuade patients to consume >660 g of vegetables daily,
a high sulforaphane-yielding whole broccoli sprout sup-
plement may be an appropriate prescription [126,129].
The microbiota
An environment that supports the health of the IEC and
immune network will most likely also support the micro-
biota, assuming that appropriate prebiotics are part of the
regular dietary intake. The effect of the diet on the micro-
biota is inﬂuenced by seasonal variations, and this is

apparent in traditional societies such as the Hadza hunter-
gatherers in Tanzania, who exhibit an exceptionally
diverse microbiome. Such seasonal effects are less likely to
occur in those consuming a modern Western diet, which
contributes to lower diversity [148].
A detailed discussion of the available prebiotics that
will enhance proliferation of the butyrate-producers and
other desirable microbes is beyond the scope of this chapter
and readers are referred to a recent comprehensive review
of the subject [46].
Therapeutic interventions
Probiotics as therapy
Although it is tempting to consider that probiotics might
achieve the desired restoration of a dysfunctional gut
ecosystem and its target axes, this would address only
one-half of the bidirectional relationship between the host
and its resident microbiota. Nevertheless, probiotic sup-
plementation is a key intervention recommended by inte-
grative and complementary medicine clinicians for a range
of conditions.
When considering the rationale for probiotic supple-
mentation, how does one reconcile such therapy in light of
unanswered
dilemmas?
(1)
Probiotics
typically do not colonize the host, leaving no trace in a
stool sample within a few weeks of cessation [149]; (2)
Diet can rapidly and reproducibly inﬂuence the microbiota
[45]; (3) A metagenomic analysis can identify species not
available as supplements [150]; (4) Post antibiotic therapy,
reconstitution of the microbiome has been shown to take
5 months longer with a probiotic than without [151].
Nevertheless, strong evidence supports the hypothesis
that the efﬁcacy of probiotics is both strain-speciﬁc and
disease-speciﬁc for a number of diseases and many clinical
trials have achieved successful outcomes in this manner
[152]. It appears, however, that the potential for a particular
strain to provide beneﬁt is commonly conﬂated with the
notion that any probiotic supplement claiming a high
microbial count will beneﬁt the host and reestablish the
microbiome after antibiotic therapy [153,154].
Antimicrobials as therapy
The ready availability of stool microbiome and SIBO
breath testing has seen interest in therapies aimed at
replacing missing gut microbes and/or eradicating patho-
gens or pathobionts.
Even though IECs are equipped with several specialized
mechanisms to actively eradicate undesirable microbes,
enhancement of these mechanisms does not appear to be a
target of the therapies commonly employed by clinicians.
A popular therapeutic approach within the Integrative
and Complementary Medicine community is that of “weed,
seed and feed,” wherein the ﬁrst step involves the use of a
plant-derived
antimicrobial
address
dysbiosis. The “seed” step follows with the administration
of either individual or combinations of probiotics which are
“fed” by the use of prebiotic supplements.
A Google search using the term “weed seed feed”
returns numerous entries but notably, none of these is from
a peer-reviewed PubMed publication. As is the case with
pharmaceutical antibiotics, no plant-derived antimicrobial
is selective for pathogens alone, so that some degree of
commensal destruction will occur with resultant compro-
mise

population
[155].
uncertainties in the nature of SIBO and its diagnostic
options are highlighted in this 2019 review of SIBO
research over the last 3 years [156].
Is it time for a host-centric model?
Given that there remain many unanswered questions in
relation to the clinical applications of both probiotics and
antimicrobials as therapy for addressing dysbiosis and
consequent chronic conditions, a model that focuses on
restoring homeostasis within the gut ecosystem may more
reasonably

endogenous

mechanisms.
A diet and lifestyle that is ideal for the host may, with
some speciﬁc consideration for the prebiotic needs of the
commensal microbes, be similarly ideal for the micro-
biome. Addressing the requirements of a healthy gut
ecosystem to harness the various endogenous mechanisms
discussed in this chapter should simultaneously provide for
all physiological processes, including the gut-brain axis.
In the words of Litvak et al., “Because our immune
system already has a way to balance the colonic micro-
biota, harnessing this host control mechanism for thera-
peutic means could provide an alternative to targeting the
microbes themselves for remediation of dysbiosis” [61].
In our seemingly insatiable quest to manipulate the
composition of the gut microbiome for the enhancement of
human health, it is worth contemplating that Nature has
sustained human life on this planet for millenniadand all
without any of the beneﬁts conferred by modern technol-
ogy. Clearly, there are processes embedded within human
cells that have allowed them to adapt to their ever-changing
environments.

Clinical applications
The genus Crocus, belonging to the Iridaceae family,
comprises more than 100 species which are distributed in
Eurasia, primarily in Mediterranean Europe and Western
Asia. Crocus sativus L., the only species that has com-
mercial importance, is traditionally cultivated in several
countries such as Azerbaijan, France, Greece, India, Italy,
and recently also in Afghanistan, New Zealand, China,
Israel, Japan, and Mexico [1]. However, the majority of
world production derives from Iran. The stigma of the plant
(saffron) is the most expensive spice in the world. Although
it has been used in traditional medicine since ancient times,
the importance of saffron crocus as a medicinal plant has
increased only in the past decades, after the discovery of its
antidepressant effect. The phytochemistry of the stigma has
been studied in detail and the mechanism of antidepressant
action has been investigated in several preclinical experi-
ments. Clinical efﬁcacy has been conﬁrmed in clinical trials
and their meta-analyses. Future perspectives of C. sativus
as a medicinal plant include the use of plant parts other than
the stigma, which could reduce therapeutic costs, and
extension of its use to other therapeutic areas of central
nervous system (CNS) disorders.
This review aims to provide a snapshot of the current
status of knowledge of the phytochemistry and pharma-
cology of saffron, and other parts of the saffron crocus
ﬂower, with special focus on the psychopharmacological
use of the plant.
Traditional and ethnomedicinal uses
Saffron has been used in the medicinal systems of regions
where it is native and cultivated. Although its contempo-
rary use covers different therapeutic areas, it is applied to
treat CNS disorders in different regions of the world. Its
use dates back to the second millennium BC, when As-
syrians and Babylonians used saffron in treatment of
“problems of head” [2]. According to Zakariya Razi, a
famous Iranian healer (865e925 CE), the use of saffron
led to an elevated feeling of pleasure, close to a psychotic
state [3]. Avicenna (980e1037 CE) in his Canon of
Nutraceuticals in Brain Health and Beyond. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-820593-8.00015-X

Medicine combined the works of Pedanius Dioscorides
(40e90 CE) and Galen (129e200 CE) with contemporary
Eastern medical practices. In this text, he refers to the
sedative and exhilarating effects of saffron [4]. The latter
characteristic could indicate its potential use to treat
depression. However, from the list of indications deter-
mined by Pedanius Dioscorides [5] only the treatment of
overindulgence could be somewhat considered as an
indication related to the CNS. Considering that Galen in
his major work did not mention the medicinal use of
saffron, it can be assumed that the application of saffron to
CNS indications only became widespread in ancient or
medieval Arabic medicine. In China, the dried stigma [Xi
Hong Hua (西红花)] is used to relieve anxiety, depres-
sion, fear, and confusion, and to treat psychosis [6]. In
Ayurvedic medicine, it is used for its relaxant, antistress,
and antianxiety effects. In contemporary Iranian folk
medicine, saffron is used to strengthen the senses and
elevate mood and it is thought that its odor is hypnotic [2].
Chemical constituents
Botanically, C. sativus L. is a monocot perennial herb. The
ﬂower of C. sativus comprises three stamens and three
stigmas (outer sections of carpels) which are the distal ends
of the plant’s stalk. Since the petals and the sepals are not
distinguishable, those parts are therefore called tepals. It is
noteworthy that in several papers, the chemical composi-
tion of sepal and petal samples has been reported. Below
we use the same names as mentioned in the literature.
Phytochemical studies have primarily focused on the
compounds responsible for the color and aroma of saffron
since these determine the value of the plant as a spice
[7e13]. For the same purpose, in a majority of the studies,
the stigma was examined [8e10,13e20]. Chemical anal-
ysis of C. sativus stigmas has shown the presence of about
150 volatile and non-volatile compounds. The volatiles
consist of terpenes (terpene alcohols, and their esters),
among which safranal is the main component. Non-volatile
compounds comprise crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and
ﬂavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol) (Fig. 15.1).
In recent years, due to increased afﬁrmation of saffron
bioactivities, and considering its high price, much effort has
been made toward investigating the other parts of C. sativus
ﬂowers, which are mainly considered as waste by-products,
including the tepals and stamen. C. sativus by-products are
rich sources of phenolics [21,22], including ﬂavonoids
[21e23] and anthocyanins [22].
Stigma
The chemical composition of saffron consists of primary
(5% fat, 12% protein, 5% crude ﬁber, and 63% sugars)
[3,24] and secondary metabolites (apocarotenoids, mono-
terpenoids, and ﬂavonoids) [11]. Among the major sec-
ondary metabolites of saffron, carotenoids have been
identiﬁed as predominant compounds.
Apocarotenoids are the products of the oxidative
cleavage of carotenoids. The apocarotenoid crocetin (8,80-
diapo-8,80-carotene-dioic acid) (4) is one of the major
compounds responsible for the color of saffron, and it is
formed by the enzymatic cleavage of zeaxanthin [7]. Crocin
(trans-crocetin bis(b-D-gentiobiosyl) ester) (1) is a water-
soluble carotenoid pigment. The term crocin refers to
members of a series of related carotenoids that are either
monoglycosyl or diglycosyl esters of crocetin, including
crocin itself, which account for more than 60% of the total
crocetin sugar esters [12]. Several studies reported crocins
as the main compounds of saffron comprising approxi-
mately 6e16% of total dry matter [10,14e20].
Saffron is rich in picrocrocin (2) as the second major
compound (1e13% of dry matter) [8,10]. This mono-
terpene glycoside, responsible for the bitter taste and ﬂavor
of saffron, has been assumed to be the precursor of safranal
and produced by degradation of zeaxanthin [25].
The aroma of saffron is mainly attributed to safranal (3)
as its third main secondary metabolite. Safranal is mostly
produced through the hydrolysis of picrocrocin. This aro-
matic aldehyde is the predominant constituent of saffron
volatile oil (30e70%) [9,13]. Apart from safranal and
isophorone and its isomers, 4-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethyl-1-
cyclohexen-1
carboxaldehyde,
along
terpenes,
terpene alcohols, and their esters have been documented as
the volatile components of saffron [8,25].
In addition to the abovementioned major components,
ﬂavonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin, apigenin,
luteolin, and myricetin glycosides), vitamins (B1, C2, C6,
C, A, and F), phytosterols (b-sitosterol and stigmasterol),
nitrogen-containing compounds (thymine, uracil, harman,
and nicotinamide), terpenoids (monoterpenes, tetraterpenes,
triterpenoids, and diterpenoids), fat-soluble carotenoids
(phytoene, phytoﬂuene, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and a- and
b-carotene), and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid, caffeic
acid, and gallic acid) have been characterized in saffron
[18,19,26e32].
Flowers except stigma
In some studies, the ﬂowers of C. sativus (except stigma)
have been phytochemically investigated. Kaempferol-3-O-

sophoroside was identiﬁed as the major compound [33],
among
several non-ﬂavonoids including
crocetin
de-
rivatives, picrocrocin, crocusatin B and C, safranal, and
sinapic acid derivatives [16,34,35].
Tepal
Most of the studies on C. sativus by-products have focused
on the tepals [10,36e45]. Flavonoids, exclusively ﬂavonol
aglycons and glycosides, have been identiﬁed as the most
predominant compounds, whereas safranal is missing from
this plant part [45].
The most abundant ﬂavonol aglycons were character-
ized (in descending order) as kaempferol (5) [36,38,43,45],
quercetin (6) [36,43,44], isorhamnetin (7) [36], and nar-
ingenin (8) [43]. Kaempferol glycosides were detected as
the main secondary metabolites of C. sativus tepals, spe-
ciﬁcally
kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside
(9)
[40e42,44],
kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (astragalin) (10) [10,36,38], and
kaempferol 7-O-glucoside [37e39]. From quercetin gly-
cosides, quercetin-3-O-sophoroside (11) [36,41], and from
isorhamnetin
derivatives,
isorhamnetin-3-O-sophoroside
were the major component [36,37,39].
Several glycosylated anthocyanins have been identiﬁed
in tepal samples of C. sativus. These plant parts are rich in
delphinidin derivatives (mainly delphinidin-3,5-di-O-b-
glucoside) [10,41], beside petunidin derivatives [41].
Organic acids were also detected in C. sativus tepals,
particularly phenolic acids including p-coumaric acid,
vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, protocatechuic acid
methyl ester, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 3-hydroxy-4-
methoxybenzoic acid [38].
Furthermore, the presence of nitrogen-containing com-
pounds (e.g., tribulusterine, harman, nicotinamide, and
adenosine) [38], monoterpenoids (crocusatin-C, -D, -E, -I,
-J, -K, and -L), picrocrocin [38], crocin [45], cyclo-
hexadiene derivatives [38], along with kinsenoside, good-
yeroside A, and 3-hydroxy-g-butyrolactone [42] was also
documented.
Stamen
The stamen contains kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside [40,44]
and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside [40] in lower concentrations
than tepals, as well as other ﬂavonoids and anthocyanins
[22].

Mode of action
Most of the preclinical studies have been carried out with
saffron (the stigma of the plant) or its secondary metabo-
lites, and have focused mainly on the antidepressant effect.
However, several studies have examined the neuro-
protective and anticonvulsant effects.
Antidepressant effect
Crocin, safranal, and crocetin are the components of the
plant that play a role in the antidepressant effect based on
the available evidence. A bioactivity-guided study identi-
ﬁed crocin as the active component by means of behavioral
models of depression [46,47], and this was reconﬁrmed by
similar studies [48]. Efﬁcacy was demonstrated in a clinical
study, where crocin (30 mg per day for 8 weeks) reduced
the symptoms of depression in subjects with metabolic
syndrome compared to the placebo group [49]. As an
adjunct treatment, crocin (30 mg daily) increased the efﬁ-
cacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in patients
with major depression [50].
The anxiolytic effect of crocin was demonstrated in
animal experiments [51,52]. One further study reported an
anxiolytic effect for safranal [53]. In an animal experiment,
the antidepressant effects of crocin and crocetin were
evaluated in mice after acute and subacute administration
where crocetin was observed to be more effective than
crocin in the forced swimming (FST) and tail suspension
tests [54].
The mechanism of the antidepressant effect has not
been fully elucidated. It might be partly mediated by
safranal and crocin inhibiting the uptake of dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin, as demonstrated in an ani-
mal experiment [55]. Crocin is a weak inhibitor of mono-
amine oxidase (MAO), whereas safranal lacks this effect
[56]. The antidepressant activity of crocin might be asso-
ciated with the suppression of neuroinﬂammation and
oxidative stress, as observed in an experiment in the mouse
hippocampus [48]. The aqueous extract of saffron increased
the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
VGF neuropeptide, cAMP response element binding pro-
tein (CREB), and phospho-CREB (p-CREB) in rat hippo-
campus, which might be related to the antidepressant effect
[57]. The effect on CREB might be only a marginal role in
the antidepressant activity of crocin, since CREB levels
changed only slightly in the rat cerebellum, whereas the
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and VGF neu-
ropeptide were unaltered [58]. However, a study reported
that crocin prevented the decreasing effect of malathion on
BDNF in the rat hippocampus [59]. Crocetin exerted anti-
depressant activity in animals exposed to chronic stress and
also decreased oxidative damage in their brains [60].
It has been demonstrated that saffron can inhibit N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and sigma opioid receptors.
Since NMDA and sigma receptors can regulate cortico-
sterone release from the adrenal cortex in rats, it can be
concluded that saffron and crocin may inhibit corticoste-
rone secretion in stressed mice via blockade of NMDA and/
or sigma opioid receptors located in the adrenal cortex [61].
Both hydro-ethanolic saffron extract and trans-crocetin had
an antagonistic effect on NMDA receptors in rat cortical
brain slices; however, only the extract was active on kainate
receptors [62]. Further, saffron extracts and crocetin had
afﬁnity at the phencyclidine (PCP)-binding site of the
NMDA receptor and at the sigma-1 receptor, while crocin
and picrocrocin were inactive [63]. Since a correlation
between hyperhomocysteinemia and depression is pro-
posed, the reduction of homocysteine levels by saffron in
patients with major depression might be part of its mech-
anism of action. The components responsible for this
bioactivity have not been identiﬁed [64]. It is assumed that
the clinical effect is partly related to the antioxidant ca-
pacity of the stigma [49].
The antidepressant activities of petals and corms have
been studied in animal experiments. The effects of aqueous
and ethanolic extracts of saffron stigma and petals were
studied using FST in mice: both decreased immobility time
in comparison with normal saline [65]. The petroleum ether
and dichloromethane fractions obtained from the aqueous
ethanol extract of C. sativus corms showed signiﬁcant an-
tidepressant-like activity in a dose-dependent manner in
animal behavioural models of depression [47]. Kaempferol,
a major ﬂavonoid of the petals, was reported to have an-
tidepressant activity in mice and rats in the FST [66].
Neuroprotective effect
The neuroprotective effect of saffron is partly related to its
antioxidant effect. This is supported by animal experiments.
The neuroprotective effects of the plant might be exploited
in the prevention or treatment of Parkinson disease (PD),
Alzheimer disease (AD), or other pathologies.
In rats all the alterations (oxidative markers and neu-
robehavioral activities) induced by cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion were signiﬁcantly attenuated by pretreatment
with saffron, most probably by virtue of its antioxidant
property [67]. Similarly, crocin had protective effects
against ischemic reperfusion injury and cerebral edema in a
rat model of stroke [68]. Saffron extract and crocin could
decrease glucose toxicity associated with increased reactive
oxygen species production in a cell viability assay [69].
Safranal had protective effects on different markers of
oxidative damage (redox status, lipid peroxidation, and
damage)
tissue
following quinolinic acideinduced oxidative damage [70].

In a study by Vakili et al., coadministration of saffron
extract had no effect on cognitive performance of mice, but
it reversed signiﬁcantly the aluminum-induced changes in
MAO activity and the markers of lipid peroxidation,
reﬂecting a certain level of neuroprotective potential [68].
Saffron extract improved ethanol-induced impairments
of learning behaviors in mice, which was attributed to cro-
cin, whereas picrocrocin was ineffective [71]. In a study on
rats, crocins improved working memory and attenuated
scopolamine-induced performance deﬁcits in spatial work-
ing memory [72]. Treatment of rats with saffron extract or
crocin blocked the ability of chronic stress to impair spatial
learning and memory retention, and reduced oxidative stress
damage. Further, crocin decreased plasma levels of corti-
costerone, as measured after the end of stress [73].
Saffron extract had only moderate acetylcholine esterase
inhibitory activity in an in vitro study, but crocetin, dimethyl
crocetin, and safranal were more active, with IC50 values of
96.33, 107.1, and 21.09 mM, respectively [74]. In a rat
model of experimentally induced AD, safranal prevented
learning and memory decline by ameliorating apoptosis, and
reducing inﬂammation, oxidative stress, and cholinesterase
activity [75]. Safranal exerted a protective effect against
toxicity and oxidative damage induced by beta-amyloid and
hydrogen peroxide in PC12 cells [76]. In neuronal cell
culture models of AD, crocin and crocetin reduced the ac-
tivities of b- and g-secretases, key enzymes of the amyloi-
dogenic pathway, and also amyloid accumulation [77]. In
mice with experimentally induced AD, crocin reduced the
beta-amyloid content of the brain, increased the level of
antioxidant enzymes, and reduced the level of acetylcho-
linesterase [78]. In AD transgenic mice, crocetin not only
signiﬁcantly reduced inﬂammation, but also decreased am-
yloid accumulation in the brain and improved learning and
memory deﬁcits [79]. Trans-crocetin enhanced beta-amyloid
degradation in monocytes isolated from AD patients by
upregulating the lysosomal protease cathepsin B [80].
Crocetin protected the activity of antioxidant enzymes in
rats after the administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-
OHDA), a compound that can experimentally induce PD.
Moreover, the histopathologic examination of the substantia
nigra revealed that crocetin protects neurons from the toxic
effects of 6-OHDA or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-
pyridine [81e83]. Crocin reduced neurodegeneration and
prevented the decrease in dopamine levels in rats with
rotenone-induced PD. This might be explained by the acti-
vation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis [84]. The anti-AD effect
of crocin and crocetin could partly be explained by the in-
hibition of E46K a-synuclein ﬁbrillization [85,86].
Anticonvulsant effect
Intraperitoneally administered safranal and crocin were
evaluated for their anticonvulsant effects in mice with
pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions. Safranal
reduced the seizure duration, delayed the onset of tonic
convulsions, and protected mice from death, whereas cro-
cin was not active [87]. In three different acute or chronic
experimental models in mice, safranal and nanostructured
lipid-vehicle-carried safranal showed a dose-dependent ef-
fect to relieve or prevent seizures. The nanoformulation of
safranal further increased its efﬁcacy [88]. Safranal dose-
dependently decreased the incidence and latency of both
minimal clonic seizures and generalized tonic-clonic sei-
zures following PTZ administration to rats. Since these
effects were abolished by ﬂumazenil, it was supposed that
the effect of safranal may be mediated through the
GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex [89].
Clinical applications
In this section we provide a brief summary of the clinical
evidence on the use of saffron either as an alternative or a
complementary therapy for neuropsychological conditions.
Fig. 15.2 summarizes the clinical application of saffron.
Depression is one of the most studied indications of
saffron, since its efﬁcacy and safety have been reported in
numerous clinical trials and meta-analysis. Moreover,
based on the results of in vitro and animal studies, human
clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efﬁcacy
and safety in the treatment of patients with cognitive
dysfunction and AD (Table 15.1).
The clinical efﬁcacy of saffron in the treatment of
depression has become of great interest to many research
groups worldwide: at least eight meta-analysis have been
published on this topic during the past 8 years [99e106].
Despite the fact that the inclusion and the exclusion criteria
for these meta-analysis differ (e.g., clinical trials with
different comparators, patient population, or setting were
eligible for further analysis), and therefore different datasets
were used for statistical analysis in each meta-analysis, the
conclusions of these articles are quite consistent (Ta-
ble 15.2). Saffron products (i.e., stigma, petal, extract, and
crocin) were proven to be superior to placebo and non-
inferior to the routinely used antidepressant therapy
(e.g., SSRIs, imipramine) at doses varying from 30 to
100 mg based on the Beck Depression Inventory and the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Moreover, the meta-
analysis by Ghadheri et al. and Marx et al. reported sig-
niﬁcant anxiolytic effects attributed to saffron [100,104].
In the majority of the trials saffron stigma was assessed;
however, the petals or extracts were evaluated in some
trials [107e109]. Since petals were effective in these trials,
it might be worthwhile to further investigate this underrated
and often discarded part of the plant. The optimum dose
and duration of saffron treatment is still unclear; however,
most of the trials lasted for 4e12 weeks. The vast majority
of the trials were conducted in Iran leading to a rather

populations.
Apart from the extensive research focusing on the an-
tidepressant effects of saffron, its use in patients with
cognitive dysfunction, AD, and PD has been studied to a
lesser extent. Based on a comprehensive literature search,
no meta-analysis has been performed on either topic;
however, several review articles have been published
[61,110e114]. Based on few clinical trials, saffron extract
and a crocin-containing formulation were effective in the
treatment of patients with mild AD or cognitive impair-
ment, which might be due to their antioxidant, anti-
inﬂammatory, and antiamyloidgenic effects [110].
In a 22-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
controlled trial, the efﬁcacy of saffron stigma extract
(30 mg of dried extract) was compared to donepezil
(10 mg) in 54 patients with mild-to-moderate AD [115].
Each patient in the saffron group was taking two capsules
daily, and each capsule contained 15 mg of saffron extract
with 0.13e0.15 mg safranal and 1.65e1.75 mg crocin.
Based on the applied AD Assessment Scale-cognitive
subscale (ADAS-cog) and clinical dementia rating scalee
sums of boxes (CDR-SOB) scores, saffron was found to be
as effective as donepezil. Regarding side effects, vomiting
occurred signiﬁcantly less frequently in patients receiving
saffron extract.
In another randomized study, the effect of saffron on
mild-to-moderate AD was compared to that of placebo.
Patients in the verum group were required to take 15 mg of
saffron extract prepared from the stigma (0.13e0.15 mg
safranal and 1.65e1.75 mg crocin per capsule) twice daily.
Based on the ADAS-cog and CDR-SB score results,
saffron had signiﬁcantly better effects than placebo, but the
side-effect proﬁles did not differ signiﬁcantly [90].
In a 12-month randomized controlled trial, saffron
extract was compared to memantine in patients with
moderate-to-severe AD [91]. Saffron extract was prepared
from the stigma; each capsule contained 15 mg of the
extract standardized to crocin (1.65e1.75 mg). Patients
were given one capsule of saffron extract or memantine
(10 mg) daily for the ﬁrst month and two capsules after-
ward. At the end of the trial the authors concluded that the
efﬁcacy based on Severe Cognitive Impairment Rating
Scale (SCIRS), Functional Assessment Staging (FAST),
and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and
the safety of the two treatments did not differ signiﬁcantly.
Based on the clinical evidence, saffron stigma extract is
comparable to conventional therapy (donepezil and mem-
antine) and superior to placebo in the treatment of cognitive
deterioration in patients with AD.
The effect of saffron was studied in a single-blind,
controlled trial on patients with amnesic and multidomain
mild cognitive impairment [92]. The authors concluded that
patients in the saffron group showed improvement in
MMSE scores, MRI, EEG, and event-related potential
measurements, while deterioration was observed in the
control group. Although this study suggests a promising
efﬁcacy of saffron that might ﬁll a niche, the study has
several ﬂaws regarding the preparation and dose of the
saffron product.
The effects of saffron-containing combinations on
cognitive function were assessed in a crossover trial

conducted in Iran [93]. Thirty patients diagnosed with mild-
to-moderate AD (ADAS-cog score 12) were randomized
into two groups to receive either placebo or a combination of
Cyperus rotundus (500 mg), C. sativus (30 mg), and honey
(5 g) twice daily for 2 months with a 1-month washout
period. The authors concluded that there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups during and
after completing the trial. A saffron-containing nutraceutical
product improved cognitive function in young elderly pa-
tients [94]. In this crossover trial, 30 patients were given a
combination of Bacopa monnieri (320 mg),
L-theanine
(100 mg), C. sativus (30 mg), copper, folate, and vitamins of
B and D groups or placebo for 2 months, and signiﬁcant
improvement was attributable to the combination, based on
the MMSE and Perceived Stress Questionnaire scores. In
another study, 16 healthy adults (MMSE score >28) in
Australia were enrolled to complete a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial [116]. During the
course of the study the patients in each arm received either a
herbal combination (Sailuotong) containing Panax ginseng
(27.27 mg ginsenosides), Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo ﬂavone-
glycosides), and C. sativus (5.46 mg of crocin) twice daily
or placebo for 2 months, with a 1-month washout period. The
results indicated that the herbal combination might enhance
cognitive function and working memory in healthy adults.
The effect of alcoholic extract of saffron petal on visual
short-term memory (STM) was assessed in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study [95]. Based on the
results of the 20 enrolled healthy volunteers; saffron extract
improved STM which might be linked to its previously
investigated anxiolytic effects.
randomized,
placebo-controlled,
crossover study, short-term administration (14 days) of
crocetin (7.5 mg per day) in healthy adults improved sleep
quality based on objective (EEG data) and subjective
(OSA-MA scores) parameters without side effects compared
to placebo [96].
In a double-blind, randomized trial, saffron stigma
extract (15 mg twice daily) was proven to have comparable
efﬁcacy to ﬂuvoxamine (100 mg) in the treatment of pa-
tients (n ¼ 50) with mild-to-moderate obsessive compul-
sive disorder [97].
Schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine are prone
to develop metabolic changes that might lead to metabolic
syndrome. In a triple-blind, three-arm, randomized, controlled
trial, 66 schizophrenic patients on olanzapine treatment
were randomized to receive either aqueous extract saffron
(15 mg twice daily) or crocin (15 mg twice daily) or placebo
twice daily for 12 weeks [98]. At the end of the trial, none
of the patients in the saffron group developed metabolic
syndrome, which indicated that saffron might be used as an
add-on-therapy in olanzapine-treated patients.
In summary, numerous clinical trials and meta-analysis
have been published over the past two decades to assess the
efﬁcacy and safety of saffron in the treatment of various
neuropsychological conditions. Most of the publications
reported favourable effects attributable to saffron. Never-
theless, it is important to highlight that most of these trials
had considerable risk bias, and publication bias is also
suspected. The effects of saffron on neuropsychological
problems other than depression are relatively under inves-
tigated; few trials have been designed to answer the same
clinical question. It is worth mentioning that saffron was
well-tolerated in every clinical trial, and no serious adverse
event occurred in the saffron-treated groups. To improve
the quality of evidence on saffron and to verify these
promising results, further larger trials, involving diverse
ethnic populations, are needed.
The therapeutic importance of saffron is increasing due to
the discovery of its antidepressant and neuroprotective ef-
fects. The mechanisms of action and the active constituents
behind these effects are not fully known. The recognition
that parts of the ﬂower other than the expensive stigma
might have clinical value gave new impetus to the scientiﬁc
studies on C. sativus. The clinical efﬁcacy of the whole
plant, and in particular that of saffron, has been studied in
several trials, mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with
depression. The examination of additional psychopharma-
cological effects of C. sativus may open up new horizons
for future scientiﬁc studies.

Adverse effects and safety
On April 08, 1906, Alois Alzheimer conducted a post-
mortem evaluation on the brain of Auguste D. She was a
51-year-old woman who had died following 5 years of
severe cognitive impairment, paranoid delusions, sleep
disorders, social malfunctioning, and progressive aphasia
[1]. His ﬁndings constitute the beginning of an under-
standing of one of the most perplexing and unyielding
neurodegenerative disorders known. His brain biopsy
ﬁndings revealed the presence of senile (now called
amyloid) plaques, neuroﬁbrillary tangles, and some arte-
riosclerotic changes, all of which are recognized today as
hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) [2]. Subsequently,
there have been extensive studies aimed at understanding
the pathomechanisms behind these changes, especially
those molecular changes that can aid target drug discovery.
Dementia crisis

diseases, and improved geriatric healthcare. Its prevalence
shows a meteoric rise from 1% at 60 years to 35% at 90
years in recent decades [3]. AD is a particularly severe and
debilitating type of dementia and accounts for 60% of all
dementias worldwide [4]. The World Alzheimer’s Report
2015 showed an increase in global spending on Dementia
from US$ 604 million (2010) to US$ 818 million (2015)
[5]. For people living for more than 60 years, dementia
consumed more years with disability (11.2%) than most
other insidious illnesses like cerebrovascular accident
(9.5%), musculoskeletal disorder (8.9%), cardiovascular
morbidity (5.0%), and cancers (2.4%). Also, the disability
weight for dementia is more than for most health conditions
barring terminal malignancy and spinal cord injury [6].
A century after its clinicopathological recognition, AD
still persists as an extremely resilient public health burden
with devastating consequences in the elderly. Yet minimal
therapeutic interventions exist for AD, most targeted to
symptoms rather than the pathology.
Scope of the chapter
This chapter utilizes tables (and illustrations) extensively
within the text; to complement it rather than to summarize
it. Care has been taken to ensure that the content of the
tables is sufﬁciently descriptive and contiguous to link it
with the text. Hence, readers are urged to use these tables
and charts in conjunction with the text.
Genetics
AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder of undeter-
mined etiology. Several genes have been associated with
AD, the important ones are summarized in Table 16.1 along
with their pathomechanisms [7,8].
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of AD isn’t clearly understood; however,
there have been several attempts to connect our recent
knowledge of genes linked to AD and the pathbreaking
histopathological ﬁndings of Alois Alzheimer to the
symptoms of AD. Overproduction and reduced clearance of
amyloid-beta (Ab) peptides and accumulation of hyper-
phosphorylated tau (ps) protein are the key pathomechan-
isms of AD. Accumulated Ab peptides form diffuse
extracellular senile plaques while intracellular ps causes
development of neuroﬁbrillary tangles [8]. Histopatholog-
ically, AD is characterized by the appearance of diffuse
extracellular senile plaques, intracellular neuroﬁbrillary
tangles, astrogliosis, and reactive microgliosis in the brain
parenchyma [9]. Vascular disease further increases deposits
of Ab peptides [10]. These microscopic changes begin in
the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe and later pro-
ceed to larger areas of the brain [11]. Progress of AD is
mainly due to the pathobiological cascades initiated by
TABLE 16.1 Genetics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

these plaques and tangles. These changes cause immuno-
logic and oxidative damage of the brain parenchyma which
is progressive, irreversible, and ultimately causes brain
atrophy.
In an attempt to make the readers’ understanding of AD
therapies easier and more target intensive, certain molecular
pathomechanisms and immunoinﬂammatory cascades are
explained along with targeting drugs in Table 16.2.
Clinical features
It is seen in old age and rarely before 60 years where it
follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.
However, its prevalence doubles every 5 years after the age
of 65 [12].
AD often begins with memory impairment. Episodic
memory associated with recall of recent events is lost ﬁrst
while working memory associated with programmed motor

APP secretase inhibitor:
APP is initially cleaved at a- and b- sites by a- and b- (b-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 or BACE1) secretases in its juxtamembranous
domain. Subsequently, membrane-bound stubs are cleaved at g- and ε- sites by g-secretase. This results in the secretion of nonamyloi-
dogenic p3 fragment and amyloidogenic Ab plaques. Pathologic-accelerated cleavage in AD causes the accumulation of Ab plaques.
The idea of drugs targeting secretases is to reduce Ab load in brain.

Passive immunotherapies targeting Ab peptide:
After Ab peptides have aggregated as plaques. Their N-terminal is still exposed while the C-terminal isn’t available to monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs), hence mAbs targeting N-terminal are useful only in advanced disease while those recognizing C-terminal are useful
to prevent plaque formation. Also, as the antibodies couple with circulating soluble Ab peptides, it alters the Ab equilibrium between
brain and blood favoring further drainage of Ab peptides from the brain. This is hypothesized to be the peripheral sink effect.

learning is affected much later in the disease. This is
because the former is controlled by the hippocampus and
adjacent temporal lobe which is affected ﬁrst, while the
latter is a function of the subcortex which is affected only in
severe disease. Factual memory or semantic memory is also
affected in later stages but procedural memory is preserved
[13,14]. The frequency of neuropsychiatric impairments
rises during the later course of the disease and often pre-
sents as the direst therapeutic concerns. They include
apathy, depression, hallucination, and paranoid delusions.
Irritability and agitation stem from the person’s inability to
perform tasks they accomplished easily in the past [15].
Besides cognitive decline, neurobehavioral deterioration
presents as a signiﬁcant and comparatively more treatable
challenge, especially in advanced AD making a case for
institutionalization.
Current and potential treatments
In spite of the extensive public health hazard posed by AD,
only two classes of drugs have been found minimally
effective in the treatment of AD. This is mostly because
clinical trials for newer molecules have had a 99.6% failure
rate [16]. Existing therapies are aimed at amelioration of
symptoms by counterbalancing the impaired synaptic
transmission in affected areas of the brain [17,18]. How-
ever, there are no approved agents that can modify the
molecular pathologic changes in AD, i.e., there is no
disease-modifying therapy that can stall the progress of
AD. Hence, although current therapies provide symptom-
atic relief, it is effective only until the disease has inevitably
worsened to a point of no return. That makes a case for
research and development of agents targeting the plaques
and tangles and/or the neurodegenerative changes caused
by them. A summary of the important approved, potential,
and withdrawn therapeutic agents for AD is summarized in
Table 16.2.
Nutraceuticals in AD
Currently, available medications control the symptoms of
AD to an extent, but don’t affect the pathology and hence
don’t alter the progress of AD. Hence, with the progress of
AD, symptom control wears out and the patient inevitably
becomes debilitated and dependent on others even for ac-
tivities of daily living [19].
Therapeutic interventions attempting to block the
immunopathological cascade catalysed by the plaques and
tangles would be the mainstay in controlling the progres-
sive neurodegeneration in AD in years to come. From

Table 16.2 it is evident that in spite of precise interruptions
in the AD pathologic sequence in laboratory or animal
studies, the newer molecules have failed to translate the
same effects in clinical trials.
While drug discovery shall still continue and prudently
so, it has become increasingly important to discover safer
biomolecules that target alternate complementary and/or
synergistic mechanisms too. Hence, herbal preparations and
molecules that have been known to have memory-
enhancing effects have garnered tremendous momentum
in recent years. Meticulous standardization of the active
constituents from these herbs followed by their rigorous
efﬁcacy-safety trials have a potential to develop a wide
array of therapeutics for AD [19].
Historical origin
Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine in India
originating in the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 3000
BC). It has practiced and perfected administration of herbal
medications for Vata Dosh (neurological disorders) over
several years. The Sanskrit word Vata means air humor and
was a part of an ancient belief that nervous impulses to and
from the brain are in fact air traveling through the body.
Vata Vyadhi (imbalance in air humor) causes neurological
disorders like weakness, hypersensitivity, or derangement
of the nervous system [19].
Ayurveda literature doesn’t directly mention dementia
but Smṛtinasha (memory loss) has been described as a
prodrome of jara (aging) or Jaravastha (old age above 60
years) [20,21]. Sushruta Samhita, Charak Samhita, and
Atharva Veda, the cardinal texts of Ayurveda describe
Rasayana (herbal preparations) having prabhava (effect) on
Medhya (intellect and memory) as Medhya Rasayana [8].
Classically, Medhya Rasayana (nervines or nootropics)
include Yastimadhu, Mandukaparni, Guduchi, and Shank-
hapushpi. Later several other herbs including Brahmi,
Jatamansi,
Guduchi,
etc.,

nootropic effect [8,19]. Ancient scholars have been known

lengthy scriptures [8]. This further raises our curiosity
about their use as prophylactic nutraceuticals for AD in
present times.
Scope of the chapter
Identiﬁcation of the place of Brahmi or Bacopa monnieri
among other “signiﬁcant” Medhya Rasayana is the core
object of this chapter. This chapter focuses on the more
researched herbal medications while emphasizing that
extensive long-term, multicentric clinical trials still need to
be done to ensure their long-term efﬁcacy, biosafety, and
scope as potential nutraceuticals.
Plant-derived AD drugs
The more effective and studied plant derivatives are dis-
cussed in Table 16.3 with a focus on their useful parts,
bioactive molecules (active agents), target actions, and
clinical use [8,19,21-31]. This will help us better under-
stand the comparative scope of B. monnieri as an AD drug.
B.
Herpestis
(Hindi:
Brahmi,
Sanskrit: Aindri, Vietnamese: Rau Ðaắng) is a water hyssop
that has been recognized in Ayurvedic medicine as a
Medhya Rasayana or nervine tonic thought to have a
“memory boosting” action on the brain [8,32-34].
Niche and morphology
B. monnieri is a subtropical creeper belonging to the
Scrophulariaceae family that grows in the damp marshlands
at an altitude of 1500 m above sea level [35]. Although its
medicinal uses were originally identiﬁed in India, it was
also found in other areas of the Indian subcontinent (Nepal
and Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia (Taiwan, China, and Viet-
nam), and also tropical Africa and subtropical United States
(Florida and other southern states) [36]. In the United
States, it grows in paddy ﬁelds and is often confused for
weeds. It grows luxuriantly in marshlands close to fresh-
water aquatic bodies. It is a succulent herb with branched
leaves and purple ﬂowers with every part including roots
ﬁnding a medicinal application [37].
Isolation, extraction, and patent
Kahol et al. have perfected and patented the process of
extraction, isolation, and concentration of Bacosides from

Antioxidant and iron chelation
Oxygen is crucial for functioning of the human brain.
However, its excess leads to accumulation of free radicals
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydroxyl (OH0),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite (ONO2
), and
superoxide free radical (O2
’) which forms the basis for
oxidative damage and neurodegeneration in old age
[40,41]. Free radical scavenging mechanisms, both enzy-
matic and nonenzymatic, protect the brain against this
damage. Enzymes like glutathione peroxidase (GPx),
catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRed), and nonen-
zymatic mechanisms like coenzyme Q10, vitamins A, C,
and E, selenium, and glutathione (GSH) protect against
oxidative damage [42]. Brain is particularly vulnerable to
oxidative damage owing to higher unsaturated fatty acid
content in neuronal cells, higher metabolism, and lesser
antioxidants [43]. Free radicals generated due to mito-
chondrial autophagy further leads to microglial activation,
which further generates free radicals that damage the
mitochondria. These vicious oxidative cascades are an
important factor in neurodegeneration in AD [44].
Extensive in vitro and animal studies have been
conducted that demonstrate the free radical scavenging and
antioxidant actions of EBm, they are summarized in
Table 16.4. [43,46-49] As an antioxidant in AD, EBm
increases the level of free oxide scavengers like GSH, GPx,
CAT, and SOD. Reduction of free radicals has been linked
to improved memory and cognition in AD [50].
Cholinergic system
The role of acetylcholine in memory processing and
learning has been established in previous studies [51]. Loss

AD.
AD,
choline
acetyltransferase (ChAT) production reduces to 35%e
50% of normal, and this causes impaired attentional
processing and loss of cognition as the ACh reduces
with progressing severity of the disease [52]. Reduced
choline uptake, deﬁcient ChAT, and increased synaptic
AChE are the cholinergic mechanisms of AD [52]. Studies
on EBm targeting the above mechanisms are illustrated in
Table 16.5 [53-56].
b-Amyloid plaques

Neuroprotectivity (neuronal and glial
plasticity)
Brain defends itself against metabolic and immunologic
stress by restructuring its synapses and neuronal network.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin,
and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) play an important
role in glial plasticity. While BDNF regulates transcription
of gene Arc associated with neuronal plasticity, GFAP
regulates astrocyte morphology and glial-glial interaction,
both clinically preventing amnesia. These mechanisms are
summarized in Table 16.7 [60,61].
Cerebral blood ﬂow
The watershed zone in the basal forebrain especially at the
hippocampus makes AD more likely when in combination
with vascular pathologies like impaired cerebral perfusion
and atherosclerosis [62]. Various animal models evaluating
the effects of Brahmi on cerebral ﬂow are illustrated in
Table 16.8 [63,64].
Memory impairment and cognitive defects
AD is associated with amnesia and cognitive deﬁcit. EBm
has shown to reverse these detrimental effects as evidenced
by animal studies vide Table 16.9 [65-68].

Adverse effects and safety
Considering that EBm use, both for prevention and treat-
ment of AD, is a long-term affair, the chances of side-
effects cannot be ignored. However, there is a dearth of
good adverse effect outcome studies on EBm, both in
young adults as well as elderly. Further, there are no studies
involving use in pregnant and lactating women. Elevated
liver markers reported by Allan et al. [77] make a case for
the study of EBm and hepatocellular injury. Some studies
researching the adverse effects of EBm are summarized in
Table 16.12 [45,77].

Standardization of active constituents, advanced mo-
lecular studies, and metacentric trials aimed at verifying
and sharpening our understanding of B. monnieri can
provide vital clues to its use as an adjunct if not an alter-
native to the very limited armamentarium neurophysicians
have against AD. Our knowledge of use of Brahmi as a
memory-enhancing
molecule,
well
relative
biosafety proﬁle, makes a strong case for further research as
a preventive agent (nutraceutical) for AD.
It’s unlikely that such research may rival the scope of
drug discovery by a synthetic chemist; however, it can
generate newer and generic biomolecules that could be
developed further.
In this chapter, I provide an extensive evidence-based
outlook on our current understanding of B. monnieri with
a hope that it will improve our understanding and widen the
scope for further research in this area.

The term neurodegenerative disease refers to a class of
diseases characterized by gradual loss of neuronal function
attributed to neuronal cell death. These neurodegenerative
diseases are incurable and manifest at older age in its worst
pathological form. Till date well-deﬁned neurodegenerative
diseases are Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease
(PD), Huntington disease (HD), and Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS). The common symptoms of these diseases
include dementia, problems with movement and coordina-
tion, motor disorder, and other psychiatric symptoms like
anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendency. These diseases
at their initial stages affect particular portion of the brain.
For example, AD affects cortex region, PD affects
substantia nigra, loss of dopaminergic neuron occurs, and
HD affects GABAergic neurons. The main cause of the
neurodegenerative disease is the formation and accumula-
tion of protein aggregates in the neurons and brain, which
leads to aberrant synaptic activity, neurotransmission, and
synaptic plasticity. These proteins are required for carrying
out of normal physiological activities of brain like trans-
portation, mitochondrial function, and signal transduction.
The misfolded forms of the proteins form aggregates and
deposition of these aggregated forms gives rise to patho-
logical features associated with neurodegenerative diseases
[1]. The tendency of misfolding arises from genetic
mutation. For example: PD can be caused due to triplication
of a-synuclein locus, HD is attributed to the expansion of
CAG stretches at the N-terminal region [2]. Covalent
modiﬁcation of these proteins like aberrant phosphorylation
can trigger formation of aggregates. Phosphorylation of
synuclein
tau
proteins
can
lead
aggregates
and neuroﬁbrillary tangle formation in PD and AD [3].

These aggregates lead to pathological response in the brain
inﬂammation, and apoptosis (Fig. 17.1).
Role of ROS in the pathology of
neurodegenerative diseases
ROS and oxidative stress activate redox-sensitive tran-
scription factors like NF-kB that participate in transcription
of proinﬂammatory cytokines and proapoptotic genes [4].
This transcription factor is also required for activation of
survival proteins and mitochondrial antioxidants. The ﬁne-
tuning and regulation of its activity depend on the duration
of phosphorylated state of NF-kB. ROS inactivates certain
phosphatases which dephosphorylates these proteins to
regulate their activities. Prolonged activation of JNK during
oxidative stress is attributed to oxidative modiﬁcation
mediated inhibition of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP) [5].
Deposition of misfolded protein aggregates in the brain
during neurodegenerative diseases serves as a danger signal
for the cells and is recognized by resident immune cells of
the brain known as microglia [6]. These microglial cells are
activated, which is marked by changes in the morphology
of these cells to ramiﬁed branched structure. Activation of
different tolllike receptors and downstream signaling lead
tumor
necrosis factor a (TNF-a), interleukin 1b (IL-1b), IL-6,
IL-18, interferon gamma (IFN-g), macrophage inﬂamma-
tory protein (MIP)-1b, proinﬂammatory mediators like
nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2, and ROS [7,8].
Activation of microglia and consequent neuroinﬂammation
and oxidative stress can lead to neurotoxicity through
neuronal cell death.
The term “nutraceutical” was coined by Stephen DeFelice
in the year 1989. This term is derived from two wordsd
nutrition and pharmaceutical. Nutraceutical covers a wide
range of edible items like plant products, vitamins, and
minerals present in animal products, pre and probiotics that
are beneﬁcial for health [9]. The current deﬁnition of
nutraceuticals according to Merriam-Webster Online Dic-
tionary 2014 is, “1.a specially treated food, vitamin, min-
eral, herb etc, that you eat or drink in order to improve your
health 2: a foodstuff (as a fortiﬁed food or dietary supple-
ment) that provides health beneﬁts in addition to its basic
nutrition.” The developmental process of nutraceuticals is a
tedious and long one. It requires identiﬁcation of a food
material, separation, and identiﬁcation of different compo-
nents with the help of HPLC, NMR, and mass spectra. The
biological activities of the separated components have to be
determined in vitro and the mechanism of action of the
phytochemicals has to be studied. Metabolic proﬁling and
examination of safety mechanism in vivo is a crucial part of
the whole process. Finally clinical trial in different diseases
will lead to the formulation of a standard nutraceutical to be
used as nutria-drug [10]. The difference between dietary
supplement and nutraceutical is that the efﬁcacy of nutra-
ceuticals has been clinically proven in various pathological

conditions and is very close to pharmaceuticals. The
concept of nutraceuticals is gaining ground in medical and
medicinal-based industrial ground. In this chapter, we will
discuss the mechanism of well-known neurodegenerative
diseases AD, PD, HD, and ALS and the beneﬁcial roles of
different components found in daily food.
Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of the common neurode-
generative diseases accompanied by dementia and cogni-
tive impairment [11]. This disease was ﬁrst observed by
German
psychiatrist
Alois
1906.
Dr.
Alzheimer diagnosed a patient named Auguste D. who was
suffering from progressive cognitive loss. After Auguste’s
death, Dr. Alzheimer examined his brain using histology
and observed numerous miliary foci in the cortex of brain
tissue. These miliary foci are deposition of neuroﬁbrils
which are well recognized today. The pathological response
of AD is due to the accumulation and deposition of phos-
phorylated and ubiquitinated Tau proteins as neuroﬁbrillary
tangles. Neurotoxic amyloid-beta precursor protein pep-
tides (AbPP-Ab) deposition also contributes to the miliary
foci [12]. This amyloid precursor protein is synthesized in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is translocated to the
Trans Golgi network (TGN). Ab precursor is processed by
various proteases like a, b, and g proteases [13]. In recent
years, the concept of metabolic disturbance in the brain is
assumed to be the cause of the disease and the associated
neuronal damage through Ab peptide [14]. Glucose is the
only energy source for brain tissue. Inability to utilize
glucose by the brain has been observed in the AD patients
at early stage of the disease, and this deﬁcit of glucose
utilization in the brain cortex also co-relates with progres-
sive cognitive disorder [15]. This disturbance in glucose
utilization is caused by impaired insulin receptor signaling
[16].
receptor
mediated
downstream
signaling help in uptake of glucose into the brain cells for
generation of energy with the help of GLUT transporters.
Resistance to insulin or disturbance in IGF signaling leads to
inhibition of transport of GLUT transporters from cytosol to
the plasma membrane, thereby reducing glucose uptake [17].
Deﬁciency in glucose uptake results in perturbance of energy
homeostasis, ROS production, and mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, thereby promoting an inﬂammatory response [18].
Insulin and IGF signaling helps in apoptosis inhibition,
maintaining
energy balance, neuron survival,
neurites
growth, memory, and cognition [17]. Accumulation of ROS
and oxidative stress lead to modiﬁcation of lipid molecules
inside brain tissues. Oxysterols are produced through
oxidative modiﬁcation of cholesterol. Oxidative modiﬁca-
tion
cholesterol
produces
24(S)-hydroxycholesterol
(24(S), 27-OHC and 7/-Hydroxycholesterol (7/-OHC) which
metabolites
[19].
oxysterols
mediate their effects through various receptors like the
nuclear receptors, liver X receptors (LXR), and retinoic acid-
related orphan receptors (ROR) [20,21]. They also mediate
their effects through G protein coupled receptors [22].
Retinoic acid-related orphan receptors (ROR) are required
for activation of inﬂammatory Th17 cells. Oxysterols might
activate inﬂammatory response in AD through activation of
proinﬂammatory T cells.
Since the cause of AD stems from disturbances in insulin
signaling resulting in deﬁciency of glucose utilization in
brain tissue followed by oxidative stress, phosphorylation of
tau proteins, their accumulation, and inﬂammation; herefore,
nutraceuticals might have a protective role against this
neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 17.2).
Ameliorative effects of various nutraceuticals
against the pathogenesis of AD
Taurine is a sulfur containing amino acid produced through
the metabolism of cysteine. It is also generated from
methionine after methionine is converted to cysteine.
Cysteine is converted to cysteine sulﬁnic acid with the help
of cysteine dioxygenase. Cysteine sulﬁnic acid undergoes
decarboxylation by cysteine sulﬁnic acid decarboxylase to
produce hypotaurine which subsequently generates taurine
[23]. Kidney and liver are the primary sites of taurine
production; moreover, it is also produced in brain, heart,
muscles, and blood, especially leukocytes [24]. Taurine
possesses antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory properties in
different organ pathophysiological conditions [25e31].
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a bile acid which
acts as a neuroprotective agent in mouse model of AD.
Administration of TUDCA in APP/PS1 mice reduced Ab
deposition, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic function
loss. It also mitigated activation of glial cells in the brain of
APP/PS1 mice and neuroinﬂammation by downregulating
TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 protein expression. The beneﬁcial
role of TUDCA is attributed to the activation of Akt/
GSK3b signaling pathway [32]. TUDCA also modulated
apoptosis through E2F-1/p53/Bax pathway in neuroblas-
toma cell lines having higher level of Ab production and
aggregation. TUDCA reduced activities of caspase 2 and 6,
downregulated the expression of bax and bcl2 and also
reduced nuclear fragmentation [33]. Pretreatment with
taurine at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight administered
orally in ICV-STZ administered rats upregulated the
activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase
(SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione-
S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR). It
also increased glutathione level. Taurine decreased the
activity of acetylcholine esterase and also improved the
morphology of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. It exerted

neuroprotective mechanism on STZ induced cognitive
impairments in rats [34]. Jang et al. demonstrated that oral
administration of taurine ameliorated Ab-induced cognitive
deﬁcits in oligomeric Ab-infusion mouse model by directly
binding to oligomeric Ab. This binding was proved through
surface plasmon resonance [35]. Taurine ameliorated
cognitive impairment in intracerebroventricular streptozo-
tocin
(ICV-STZ)einduced
disorder
through modulation of oxidative stress parameters, secre-
tion of proinﬂammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-1b in the
hippocampal region and cortex. Choline-esterase activity
was also mitigated by taurine [36]. These studies point out
the promising nature of taurine for therapeutic purpose.
Curcumin is a polyphenol and phytochemical obtained
from Curcuma longa, a herb from which turmeric is
obtained. Turmeric is used for coloring of food in India and
large part of Southern Asia. In Indian Ayurvedic medicine,
curcumin has been used for many years for the treatment of
various organ pathophysiology [37]. Curcumin exists in
two tautomeric forms, keto and enol. It predominantly
resides in keto forms in neutral and acidic conditions.
Curcumin acts as a good antioxidant and its beneﬁcial role
as an antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory agent has been
investigated in diseases like diabetes, cancer and drug-
induced organ pathophysiology. The antioxidant property
of this polyphenol is attributed to the phenolic OH groups
which are able to lose protons and the resulting phenoxyl
diradical is stabilized by delocalization of electrons. This
resonance stabilized structure helps curcumin to scavenge
free radicals, thereby imparting it antioxidant property [38].
Deposition of oligomeric Ab plaques is attributed to the
dementia and memory loss in AD. Oral administration of
curcumin has been effective in reducing Ab plaque for-
mation in murine model. It downregulated BACE-1
enzyme, the enzyme that converts AbPP to Ab through
cleavage of AbPP [39]. Curcumin has been shown to bind
to senile plaques (SPs), tau proteins, and cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (CAA) in the aging brain of various animal
models and also in an AD patient [40]. Administration of
curcumin upregulated the expression of BAG2, an endog-
enous protein which aids in clearing of neuronal tau tangles
in primary rat cortical neurons. It also reduced phosphor-
ylated tau levels [41]. Curcumin encapsulated in especially
designed exosomes improved solubility, bioavailability,
and crossing of the blood-brain barrier through receptor
mediated endocytosis in AD models. Curcumin activated
AKT/GSK-3b pathway in the brain thereby inhibiting tau
phosphorylation and neuronal cell death in vivo in AD. The
various challenges associated with curcumin as a thera-
peutic agent in AD have been extensively reviewed else-
where [42]. Neuroinﬂammation is a hallmark phenomenon
of AD. Inﬂammatory response is mainly carried out by
activated microglial cells. Proinﬂammatory cytokines like
IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 are produced by activated micro-
glial cells in the brain [43]. Accumulation of these cyto-
kines is also accompanied by ROS production. IL-1b plays
a crucial role in the molecular mechanism of AD. IL-1b
activates (MAPK)-p38 signaling cascade which ultimately
activates the protease, BACE-1. This BACE-1 leads to
FIGURE 17.2

proteolytic cleavage of APP causing Ab deposition [44].
IL-1b also stimulates phosphorylation of tau proteins and
aggregation of neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFT) through p38
activation,
augmenting
pathology
[45].
Hyperphosphorylation of tau and its deposition as NFT
cause loss of axonal integrity and synaptic connectivity
between neurons. IL-1 cytokines also amplify inﬂammation
through activation of NF-kB [46]. Curcumin has been
found to ameliorate inﬂammatory response through mod-
ulation of IL-1 family cytokines [47,48].
Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is a well-known antioxidant that
exerts its beneﬁcial effects on several physiological func-
tions. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Vitamin C can be
synthesized from glucose. Human beings are not capable of
synthesizing vitamin C in the body owing to lack of the
enzyme, L-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase, which is required
for metabolic transformation of vitamin C from glucose
[49]. Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant by directly
scavenging free radicals or ROS. Loss of one hydrogen
gives rise to ascorbate. The resulting ascorbate is converted
to ascorbate free radical (AFR) on losing one hydrogen.
AFR is converted to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) through
rearrangement of electrons. This DHA can further undergo
dismutation to generate ascorbate. DHA can also be con-
verted to ascorbate through GSH dependent reduction and
with the help of NADPH oxidase and thioredoxin reductase
[50]. Apart from its antioxidant activity, vitamin C also aids
in the recycling of other antioxidants namely a-tocopherol
and tetrahydrobiopterin [51]. ROS and Oxidative stress are
intricately linked with AD. Brain tissue is highly vulnerable
to damage mediated by redox perturbation due to higher
content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and high oxygen
turnover. Brain has the highest content of ascorbic acid and
vitamin C is highly enriched in the hippocampus and
cortical neurons [52]. Moreover, the concentration of
vitamin C in the brain is lower in patients with AD which
points to the importance of this antioxidant molecule in AD.
Plasma level of vitamin C is also reduced in AD patients
[53]. Acute systemic injection of vitamin C in APP/PSEN1
mice ameliorated cognitive impairment [54]. Mitochondrial
dysfunction is a hallmark of AD due to accumulation of
ROS and progression of oxidative stress. Supplementation of
vitamin C reduced mitochondrial dysfunction in 5XFAD
mice (an AD model). It also reduced Ab plaque formation
and disruption of blood-brain barrier in the brain of 5XFAD
mice. Administration of vitamin C at a low dose in KO-Tg
mice might contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction due to
perturbation in balance of mitochondrial ﬁssion and
fusion. Vitamin C supplementation at a high dose in
5XFAD mice also prevented accumulation of astrocytes,
thereby reducing neuroinﬂammation in the brain [55].
Deﬁciency of endogenous ascorbate level leads to reduced
alteration in mitochondrial energy production, mitochon-
drial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, and
mitochondria isolated from the brain of mice containing
both APP/PSEN1 and SVCT2þ/ mutation compared to
wild-type isolates. Administration of ascorbate to isolated
mitochondria resulted in increased oxygen consumption
and reduced ROS formation. The study demonstrated that
amyloid plaque and vitamin C deﬁciency contribute to
mitochondrial dysfunction in AD brain, which can be used
as biomarker for initiation of AD at early stages [56,57].
Supplementation of vitamin C has been proved to be bene-
ﬁcial in clinical trial reports. Vitamin C supplementation at a
dose of 1000 mg/day along with vitamin E (400 IU/day) for
1 year increased the concentration of vitamin C in the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), as well as in the plasma of AD
patients. Moreover this co-supplementation of vitamin C and
E also reduced lipid peroxidation in CSF. The course of AD
was unaffected by vitamin supplementation [58]. Sixteen-
week co-supplementation of vitamin E, C, and carotene
signiﬁcantly improved cognitive behavior and reduced
plasma Ab levels in a trial involving 276 elder AD patients
[59]. Supplementation of vitamin C, E, and a-lipoic acid to
AD patients for 16 weeks reduced F2-isoprostane level, an
oxidative stress marker, but did not affect the Ab42 and tau
level at CSF [60].
Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound present in grape,
jackfruit, mulberry, and red wine. It is a phytoalexin
belonging to the stilbene family and is released to combat
environmental stress [61]. Resveratrol exists in two forms:
cis and trans. The trans form is more stable than the cis form
possesses
biological
activities.
Trans-resveratrol
undergoes several metabolic modiﬁcations like glycosyla-
tion, methoxylation, oligomerization, and isoprenylation to
form
trans-piceid,
pterostilbene,
trans-V-viniferin,
arachidin-3 [61]. Bioavailability of resveratrol is less than1%
through oral route on account of its poor water solubility,
higher rate of metabolism, and limited chemical stability
[62]. Co-administration of resveratrol with alkaloids like
piperidine has been found to enhance its pharmacokinetic
parametersthrough inhibitionofglucuronidation,therebyalso
increasing bioavailability of resveratrol [63]. Delivery
systems using liposome, colloidal carriers, and resveratrol-
protein complexes have been used to increase bioavailability
and efﬁcacy of this compound [64]. Resveratrol has been
foundtobeeffectiveagainst AD.Ithasbeenreportedto inhibit
formation of Ab plaques by binding to Ab in the cortex region
[65]. Resveratrol has been found to inhibit BACE1 and g
secretase. It has also been shown to inhibit Ab-mediated
microglial
APP/PS1

preventing neuroinﬂammation [66]. Neuroinﬂammation
inhibition is attributed to through down regulation of the
transcription
factor
NF-kB,
ultimately reduces secretion of cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b,
IL-6, chemoattractants like MCP-1, NO production and
prostaglandin E2 formation in AD animal model [67,68].
Accumulation of Ab plaques and activation of microglial
cells often leads to ROS production and oxidative stress
along with mitochondrial dysfunction. Resveratrol com-
bats oxidative stress by reducing ROS level through
activation of glutathione (GSH) that scavenges ROS. It has
also been found to activate redox-sensitive transcription
factor heme-oxygenase 1(HO-1) in H2O2 induced neuro-
toxicity [69]. Activation of autophagy through AMPK is
another protective mechanism of resveratrol in AD.
Autophagy induction has been shown to improve mito-
chondrial dysfunction in the brain [70]. Resveratrol exerts
its effect on brain cell death by modulating bax/bcl2 ratio
through JNK activation [71,72]. Moreover, improving
cognitive function, memory, and taupathy are a part of AD
therapy. Literature reports that resveratrol has profound
effect on these pathological phenomena of AD [73].
Catechins
Catechins are a major group of ﬂavonoids enriched in tea.
The majority of catechins found in tea are epicatechin (EC),
()-epigallocatechin(EGC), ()-epicatechin gallate (ECG),
()-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and the chemical
structures suggest much about their biological activities [74].
These catechins differ in the position of hydroxyl group in the
B and C ring of basic ﬂavone structure. The ortho-dihydroxyl
group in the B-ring contributes to its radical scavenging
activity. Presence of a gallate moiety at third position of C
ring increases radical scavenging activities. Catechins are
metabolized very rapidly, and there are chemical modiﬁca-
tions involved in their metabolism. Phase II metabolism of
catechins involves glucuronidation, O-methylation, and
sulfation by enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT),
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and phenolsulfo-
transferases (SULT). The metabolites generated through
metabolism of catechins have immense beneﬁcial biological
activities. Catechins have been known to exert their effects in
various diseases like cancer, diabetes, colitis, etc. [75e77].
Treatment with 0.5% catechins green tea prevented amyloid
beta-induced cognitive impairments in rats [78]. Oral and
intraperitoneal administration of EGCG at a dose of 50 and
20 mg/kg for 6 weeks suppressed phosphorylation of tau
proteins in APPSw transgenic AD mouse model [79].
Catechins have been found to be effective against ROS-
induced neuronal damage and inhibit activation of NF-kB
[80]. Administration of EGCG restored mitochondrial
respiratory rates, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS
production, and ATP level in the mitochondria isolated
from hippocampus, cortex, and striatum in A_PP/PS-1 mice,
double mutant transgenic mouse model [81]. Antiin-
ﬂammatory effect of catechins is attributed to the galloyl and
hydroxyl moieties at the 30 position on EGCG. Moreover,
catechins also exert beneﬁcial effect in AD pathophysiology
through modulation of PKC, MAPK, and AKT pathways
[82e84]. Some other nutraceuticals used in treatment of AD
are given in Table 17.1.
Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative
disease which manifests at older age. It is an autosomal
dominant disorder. HD is characterized by cognitive
impairment and motor symptoms. The motor symptoms
include irregular muscle jerks which are involuntary in
nature (referred to as chorea). Moreover HD is also
accompanied by depression and anxiety [95]. The disease
has been named after an American doctor, George Hun-
tington, who described the condition and its symptoms. The
pathophysiological response of HD is attributed to the
mutation in the huntingtin gene (htt). The mutant form is
caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n, which
encodes amino acid glutamine located at the N-terminal
coding region of huntingtin gene. This glutamine poly-
nucleotide
sequence
gives
rise
mutated
form
huntingtin [96]. The function of nonmutated huntingtin
gene includes endocytosis, vesicular trafﬁcking, and syn-
aptic transmission. Huntingtin protein also participates in
autophagy and transcription of various genes [97]. The
mutated HTT (m HTT) causes aberrant disruption in tran-
scription, aggregate formation, and oxidative stress. The
extended polyglutamine sequence leads to gain of function
of the mutated htt gene which causes toxic effects [98]. m
HTT proteins form aggregates in the cytosol and also
polyglutamine inclusion in the nucleus. This polyglutamine
inclusion contains ordered amyloid ﬁbers with low solu-
bility in detergent and form aggregates [1]. These aggre-
gates also sequester proteins important for transcription of
several genes like cell cycle regulation, maintenance of
DNA, cellular signaling, protein transport, metabolism, and
cellular homeostasis. The interactome of polyglutamine
inclusion contains a wide array of proteins covering a vast
diversity of cellular functions which make unsurprising
facts that the toxic effect of the inclusion will be well
pronounced [99]. m HTT has been shown to bind to the
outer membrane complex of mitochondria thereby hinder-
ing ﬂow of electrons in the ETC and ATP synthesis. This
perturbation in the ETC leads to leakage of electrons
causing ROS generation and oxidative stress in the brain. m
HTT disrupts calcium homeostasis in the mitochondria. It
also damages mitochondrial DNA causing mitochondrial
dysfunction. These mutated aggregates in the nucleus bind
to the promoter region of PGC-1a, thereby hindering its

## Page 270

transcription in the brain. m HTT also binds to PGC-1a and
impairs redox defense mechanism downstream [100]. PGC-
1a aids in the expression of antioxidant genes SOD1,
SOD2, and GPx [101]. Lower levels of these antioxidants
cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a pathological
feature in HD and contributes to oxidative stress. m HTT
also binds to drp1 which is required for mitochondrial
ﬁssion and proper execution of mitochondrial dynamics
[102]. Impaired mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion leads to
accumulation of damaged mitochondria thereby increasing
cellular stress and neuronal cell death. Calcium homeosta-
sis is also perturbed in HD leading to cell death through
opening
transition
pore
resulting in release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and
activation of caspase 9 and 3 [103,104]. Perturbation of
calcium balance and its release into cytosol also generates
oxidative stress. Oxidation of pyridoxal kinase leads to
decreased availability of active vitaminB6 thereby causing
disturbance in neurotransmitter synthesis [105]. HD is
markedly characterized by reduced level of several neuro-
transmitters in different parts of the brain. Gamino butyric
acid (GABA) is signiﬁcantly reduced in the striatal region
of HD patients. The striatal region contains GABAergic,
which are the most vulnerable neurons to get damaged
during HD [106]. GABA level is also reduced in the cortex
and hippocampal regions. Disturbance in acetylcholine is
also observed. Cholinergic receptor expression and activity
of choline acetyltransferase is also reduced in the caudate
region of HD brain [107]. m HTT interferes with the traf-
ﬁcking and expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) which plays a crucial role in the survival of
neurons
[108,109].
observed in HD are motor dysfunction, cognitive disorder,
and increased risk of suicidal tendency. The nutraceuticals
used in the treatment of HD and their mechanisms are given
in Table 17.2.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. It
is associated with motor dysfunction [124]. It is induced by
the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra
region of the brain [125]. Deposition of a-synuclein protein
in various parts of the brain along with the deposition of
neuromelanin and iron lead to the formation of Lewy
bodies [126].
Neuroinﬂammation plays a major role in the gradual loss
of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Inﬂammatory responses are
manifested by the elevated release of proinﬂammatory
cytokines, glial changes, and inﬁltration of T cells. These are
important features of PD [127]. Atypical a-synuclein linked
dopamine metabolism induces oxidative stress in neural
tissue of PD models. This, in turn, activates glial reactions,
inducing
neuroinﬂammatory
responses
[128].

Mitochondria promote cell death through the generation of
toxic ROS [13]. Thus, removal of damaged mitochondria
via mitophagy is crucial [129]. Mitochondrial ﬁssion,
fusion, as well as motility play an important role in
maintaining redox balance [130]. Proper maintenance of
mitochondrial ﬁssion and fusion are disrupted with the
progression of
PD. Parkin
dependent mitophagy
induced in PD models and Drp1 associated Parkin inde-
pendent mitophagy is also found to occur in brain cells of
mammals
[131,132].
autophagy
important cell death pathways linked with the pathogen-
esis of the disease [133]. While apoptotic and necrotic cell
death are important features of PD, the role of autophagy
is seemingly anomalous. The atypical form of ae
synuclein inhibits its own autophagic clearance thereby
augmenting
toxic
aggregations
[134].
atypical
a-synuclein increases autophagy, which rather than lead-
ing to cell survival induces cell death. Autophagy is
induced by the mTOR signaling pathway via the auto-
phagy protein Atg1 and also the Vps34-Beclin1 complex
promoting cell survival [135,136].
Various nutraceuticals obtained from dietary sources
have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects
against various in vitro and in vivo models of PD. The
neurotoxins
models
rotenone, MPTP, paraquat, maneb, 6-OHDA, etc. The
nutraceuticals exert their ameliorative effects by modu-
lating various signaling pathways associated with the
pathogenesis of PD.
Ameliorative effects of various nutraceuticals
against the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease
Curcumin, a polyphenol obtained from turmeric, has
widespread therapeutic effects against the pathogenesis of
PD, a neurodegenerative disorder.
PD is associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions and
related molecular alterations, among various routes of
pathogenesis. Curcumin has been reported to exhibit
mitochondria-protective effects against various neurotoxins
[137]. Pretreatment with curcumin protected the brain
mitochondria against complex I inhibition by preventing
3-nitrotyrosine formation in vitro and elevating total
cellular glutathione level in vivo [138].
In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
treated PD model developed in SH-SY5Y cells, it has been
observed that curcumin exerts its protective effects by
enhancing autophagy, upregulating HSP90, and augmenting
the clearance of a-synuclein. Curcumin also augmented
a-synuclein clearance in lipopolysaccharide-induced PD
model of rats [139]. It inhibited oligomer formation and opens
up mitochondrial ATP sensitive Kþ channels (mitoKATP) to
antagonize the effects of mutation or overexpression of
a-synuclein [140].
Curcumin protected against homocysteine toxicity, a
potent PD model, in rats [141]. It also protected PC12
cells from the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP via
Bcl-2-mitochondria-ROS-iNOS
A53T
a-synuclein via antioxidant mechanisms, mTOR/p70S6K
signaling and recovery of macroautophagy [142e144]. It
prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in
PINK1 deﬁcient and paraquat treated SH-SY5Y cells
[145]. Curcumin ameliorated the deleterious effects of
6- hydroxydopamine (OHDA) model of PD via antioxi-
dant mechanisms, iron chelation, induction of dopami-
nergic denervation, and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway
[146e149].
PD is associated with movement disorder, inhibition of
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal hormones (HPGH), and
metabolic shift in the activity of acetyl cholinesterase
(AChE). Studies have shown that curcumin promoted
HPGH via modulation of AChE and locomotive activities
in bisphenol A-treated PD model in rats [150].
Neuroinﬂammation is an integral part of the pathogen-
esis of PD. Studies have shown that curcumin alleviates
neuroinﬂammatory and neurodegenerative effects through
various mechanisms, i.e., reduction in the level of inﬂam-
matory markers (TNF-a, IL-1b, NO, NF-kB), induction of
epigenetic changes, etc. [47].
Dopaminergic neuron-speciﬁc knockdown of dUCH, a
homolog of human UCH-L1 is a novel Drosophila model
of PD and is associated with the enhancement of oxidative
stress. Treatment of dUCH knockdown ﬂies with curcumin
has been reported to improve locomotory activities and
decreased ROS level [6]. It ameliorated oxidative damage
and death of dopaminergic neurons via Akt/Nrf2 pathway
c-Jun
N-terminal
pathway,
respectively
[151,152].
Targeted nanodelivery of curcumin in PD models

ciated use of polysorbate 80 modiﬁed cerasomes and
liposomal
formulations
targeting
deacetylase
(HDAC) (Park 7 knockout PD model in rats) [153,154].
Various derivatives of curcumin also exhibit neuro-
protective effects against different PD models: tetrahy-
drocurcumin inhibited monoamine oxidase B in MPTP
treated mice, curcumin bioconjugates like diesters of deme-
thylenated glutamic acid reduced oxidative stress, curcumin
glucoside inhibited a-synuclein oligomer formation, gluta-
moyl diester of curcumin prevented peroxynitrite mediated

nitrosative stress, demethoxycurcumin alleviated rotenone
toxicity, and cyclocurcumin prevented MPTP toxicity
[155e160].
However, curcumin mediated induction of PD-associated
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in rat mesencephalic
cells raises concern and demands further extensive research
to conﬁrm its therapeutic effects [161].
Taurine, obtained from animal tissues, ameliorates para-
quat and maneb-induced toxicity associated murine PD
model by inhibiting the activation of proinﬂammatory
markers and microglia and the prevention of microglial
M1 polarization [162].
Exposure of nigral cell suspensions to taurodeox-
ycholic acid (TUDCA), a hydrophilic taurine conjugated
bile acid, enhanced the survival probability of nigral
transplants in rat PD models [163]. TUDCA prevented
MPPþ induced JNK phosphorylation and activated the
Akt signaling pathway in MPTP treated PD model of rats
[164]. It improved locomotory activities as evident
through behavioral studies and activated Nrf2 to prevent
MPPþ mediated oxidative stress [165,166].
Vitamin C (Vit C), obtained from citrus fruits, helps in
reducing oxidative stress induced by Levodopa (L-DOPA),
potent therapeutic against PD [167]. Studies in PD patients
have also revealed that Vit C can improve
L-DOPA
absorption in elderly PD patients with poor
L-DOPA
bioavailability [168].
Vit C being a potent neuromodulator acts as biomarker
for progression of PD. Its level decreases in lymphocytes
with the progression of the disease [169]. Plasma levels of
Vit C also decrease in vascular parkinsonism [170].
Neural stem cell precursors (NSCs) impose a potent
therapeutic strategy against PD. Exposure of ventral
midbrain derived NSCs to Vit C leads to the decrease of
DNA methylation and the activation of a series of devel-
opmental and phenotypic genes thereby increasing the
survival probability of midbrain type dopaminergic neurons
(mDA) after engraftment in PD model of rats [171].
Quenching of superoxide radicals lead to the generation
of dopamine (DA)-derived quinones. The subsequently
generated oxidative stress is ameliorated by Vit C.
However, in the presence of iron, Vit C leads to the
enrichment of active Fe(II). In relation to the comparison
between Vit C and DA, DA exhibits higher afﬁnity toward
iron, leading to the formation of Fe(III)-DA2 complex.
Hence, Vit C is unable to reduce the DA bound iron. Thus,
a combinatorial therapy of Vit C and a strong clinically
veriﬁed iron chelator will be more effective in the treatment
of PD [172].
Glutamate toxicity mediated death of dopaminergic
neurons involves the activation of AMPA, NMDA, and
metabotropic receptors. Vit C is reported to prevent gluta-
mate exposure associated cell death in SH-SY5Y models of
PD [173].
L-ascorbic acid delayed the climbing disability of
Drosophila model of PD [174]. However, vitamin supple-
ments do not reduce PD risk [175].
Resveratrol,
polyphenolic
compound
derived
grapes, activated the PI3K-Akt pathway, thereby delaying
apoptosis in 6-OHDA model of PD [176]. It acts syner-
gistically with low doses of L-DOPA to generate effects
equivalent to higher doses of levodopa, thereby promoting
therapeutic effects against PD with reduced risk of side-
effects of the latter [177]. It also improved the cognitive
deﬁcits in A53T a-synuclein PD model of mice [178]. It
reduced oxidative stress in MPTP treated Drosophila
model of PD and alleviated MPPþ induced mitochondrial
dysfunction and apoptosis in SN4741 cells via Akt/GSK3b
signaling pathway [179]. Resveratrol inhibits SIRT1-
deacetylated a-synuclein mediated autophagic degradation
in MPTP mice model of PD [180]. It activates the SIRT1/
Akt pathway against rotenone toxicity in PC12 cell [181]. It
ameliorates ER stress by downregulating CHOP and Grp78
genes, suppresses xanthine oxidase activity, activates Nrf2
signaling and inhibits caspase-3 activity in the brain of
rotenone-treated PD model of rats [182]. It modulated
rotenone toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by inducing HO-1
mediated autophagy [183]. Targeted delivery of resvera-
trol
PD
models
involves
polysorbate
coated
polylactide nanoparticles and vitamin E-loaded nano-
emulsions [184,185].
Catechins
Catechins, obtained from tea, are efﬁcient iron chelators
and exhibit therapeutic effects against PD [186]. Proteomic
analysis has revealed that the mechanism of action of
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EG) involves ATP synthase
mitochondrial F1 complex b, protein kinase C ε, HIF-1a,
and neurovascular growth factor inducible precursor [187].
It modulated the mTOR/Akt/GSK-3b pathway to prevent
apoptosis in the nigral neurons of PD rats and affected the
peripheral immune response and NO activity in MPTP-
induced mice model of PD [188e190]. It reduced a-syn-
uclein aggregation and oligomer toxicity in PD models

[191,192]. Dietary supplementation of EG on transgenic
Drosophila model of PD reduced oxidative stress and
delayed climbing disability [193]. EG suppressed MPTP-
induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells via SIRT1/PGC-1a
signaling pathway [194]. Catechins improved locomotory
abilities in 6-OHDA PD models by virtue of their antiox-
idant effects and restoration of PKC activity [195].
Anthocyanins
Anthocyanins,
obtained
berry
fruits,
attenuated
L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in mice model of PD [196].
Anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin extracts obtained from
blueberry, grape seed, China rose, Chinese mulberry, and
blackcurrant suppressed rotenone and lipopolysaccharide
toxicity in primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons
obtained from PD models by attenuating mitochondrial
dysfunction and nitrite release [197].
Morin, a ﬂavonol obtained from wine and fruits, suppressed
astroglial activation, motor dysfunction, mitochondrial
dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inﬂammation in both
MPTP-induced mice and PC12 model of PD [198,199].
Quercetin, a natural polyphenol obtained from fruits,
beverages, and red onions exerted neuroprotective effects
against 6-OHDA model of PD in rats by antioxidant
mechanisms [200]. Combination of neuronal growth
factor and quercetin loaded in superparamagnetic iron
oxide nanoparticles promoted neuronal branching and
morphogenesis of PC12 cells. Hence, quercetin has the
ability to promote immense therapeutic potential against
the pathogenesis of PD [201]. Quercetin in combination
with piperine suppressed markers of oxidative stress
(nitrite, glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance,
etc.) and inﬂammation (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, etc.) and
neurotransmission
(dopamine,
serotonin,
homovanillic acid, etc.) in MPTP-induced rodent model
of PD [202]. Quercetin glycosides, i.e., rutin and iso-
exerted
6-OHDA-induced toxicity in PC12 cells. Rutin pretreat-
ment attenuated Park-2,5,7 and caspase-3 and 7 genes and
upregulated tyrosine hydroxylase gene necessary for
biosynthesis
[203].
attenuated
behavioral impairment, autophagy, and ER stress-induced
apoptosis against rotenone toxicity in rodent model of
PD [204].
Caffeine, a coffee component, along with eicosanoyl-5-
hydroxytryptamide, a fatty acid derivative of serotonin,
protected brain tissue from a-synuclein toxicity through
phosphatase
de-
phosphorylates
[205].
protected
against A53T toxicity mediated a-synucleinopathy by
regulating macroautophagy (enhances microtubule associ-
ated protein 1 light chain 3 and reduces receptor protein
sequestosome
i.e.,
SQSTM1/p62)
chaperone-
mediated autophagy (enhances LAMP2A) [206]. Absolute
lower levels of caffeine and its metabolites in the serum act
as potential biomarkers of early PD [207].
In MPTP animal model of PD, caffeine exerted
neuronal protection by blocking adenosine receptor 2A
(A2A). Caffeine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome
P450. Consortium studies have shown that some A2A
polymorphisms are inversely related to PD risk while slow
metabolizers of caffeine, i.e., homozygous carriers of cy-
tochrome P450 polymorphisms exhibit strong coffee-PD
association [208].
Though caffeine treatment reduces PD risk in men, its
effectivity is inconsistent in women due to postmenopausal
hormonal changes [209].
Vitamin A
Vitamin A (Vit A), obtained from spinach, carrots, and
animal liver destabilize a-synuclein ﬁbrils in vitro [210].
Posttreatment with 9 cis-retinoic acid reduced the loss of
dopaminergic neurons in rodent model of PD [211]. Pio-
glitazone and retinoic acid restored dopamine levels in
rotenone model of PD [212].
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare type of
neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the neu-
rons which are responsible for regulating voluntary muscle
movement. Voluntary muscles are responsible for move-
ments like walking, chewing, speaking, and swallowing.
The manifestation and outcome of the disease worsens over
time. The clinical treatment options available for ALS are
currently limited [213]. ALS belongs to a broader group of
motor neuron disorders characterized by gradual neuro-
degeneration and death of motor neurons. The upper and
the lower motor neurons get affected in ALS which sub-
sequently leads to their degeneration and hinder commu-
nication with the muscles [214]. These lead to muscle


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 275

function loss and their progressive weakening. The muscles
start to twitch and atrophy. Ultimately, the brain fails to
initiate and control voluntary movements. Weakness of
muscle is observed in the early stages of ALS which
eventually affects different voluntary actions like the ability
to speak, eat, move, and breathe [215]. Death occurs in
ALS patients within 3e5 years on account of respiratory
failure. Only 10% of ALS patients survive for 10 years or
more. Irrespective of ethnicity, males are more vulnerable
to ALS compared to females and it generally affects older
people of age group 50e70 years [216]. The pathogenicity
of ALS still remains unknown. Only about 5%e10% of
patients are reported to have a pedigree of other affected
members. The recessive and dominant forms of inheritance
of ALS are now recognized. SOD1 (copper/zinc superoxide
dismutase gene) mutations are responsible for both familial
and sporadic forms. SOD1 gene mutations account for 20%
of familial ALS and only 1%e2% of all ALS [217]. Till
date, these ﬁndings have been a major contribution to our
understanding of the ALS mainly for two reasons, primarily
there is slight clinical and pathological variance between
familial (fALS) and sporadic ALS (sALS). So research
outcomes related to the SOD1 mutation may be helpful in
sALS. Secondarily, transgenic SOD1þþ mice develop a
progressive motor neuron disease (initially in the hin-
dlimbs) like human ALS. This animal model helps in the
mechanistic study of the disease and in preclinical screen-
ings [218e222].
Oxidative stress is a major factor related to the diag-
nosis of ALS and affects machinery involving the
presynaptic transmitter [223]. In several ALS mouse
models, nerve terminals are found to be more sensitive to
ROS. Oxidative stress compromises mitochondrial func-
tioning, ampliﬁes intracellular Ca2þ levels, and also in-
tensiﬁes the presynaptic decline in neuromuscular junction
(NMJ) [223]. Ultimately inﬂammatory outbursts and loss
of trophic support lead to neurodegeneration. Protein
carbonyl contents have been found to be upregulated in
both the motor cortex and spinal cord in sporadic ALS
patients. Enhanced levels of oxidative stress marker
3-nitrotyrosine was observed in both sporadic and SOD1
familial ALS patients [224,225]. Immune reactivity of
3-nitrotyrosine was not uniform among wide ventral horn
neurons. Protein and lipid oxidation markers were found
in reactive astrocytes, motor neurons, microglia, and
macrophages in the gray matter of sporadic ALS patients,
but absent from spinal cord of healthy individuals [226].
DNA damage marker, 8- OHdG, has also been found to be
upregulated in the cervical spinal cord of ALS patients and
within the ventral horn. Augmented levels of 8-OHdG
(DNA damage), 4-hydroxynonenal (lipid peroxidation),
and ascorbate-free radical have been reported in cerebro-
spinal ﬂuid (CSF) samples from ALS patients [227,228].
Increased nitrated manganese superoxide dismutase and
3-nitrotyrosine have also been found in CSF samples from
ALS patients [229]. Considering, the role of oxidative
stress in ALS, antioxidant therapies could be a promising
approach. Many natural compounds have antioxidant
therapeutic properties. Some of these are easily available,
cheap dietary supplements such as vitamins C and E, and
are frequently prescribed by doctors for ALS patients
[230]. Patients may take speciﬁc antioxidants or patented
combinations. While the expense of individual agents may
be small, the patented combinations are more expensive. It
is important to determine the information from these
agents for the gain and possible damage.
Ameliorative effects of various nutraceuticals
against the pathogenesis of ALS
Vitamin E, or a-tocopherol, is a cluster of eight different
lipophilic
(tocopherols
tocotrienols)
synthesized by plants. Vitamin E is a-tocopherol and it
acts as an antioxidant [231]. Vitamin E protects cellular
proteins, cell membranes, and DNA from oxidation and it
also controls cellular homeostasis [232]. Vitamin E easily
diffuses into cell membranes due to its lipophilic nature
protects
polyunsaturated
fatty
peroxidation. The redox reaction between tocopherol and
harmful lipid peroxide radicals leads to the formation of
neutral lipid hydroperoxide and an unreactive vitamin E
radical (O2 tocopherol). The reaction between tocopherol
and harmful lipid peroxide radicals occurs more rapidly
than that of lipid peroxide radicals with nearest membrane
proteins or fatty acid chains. Glutathione peroxidase pro-
cesses the ultimate end product of the redox reaction, the
lipid hydroperoxides. Vitamin C (ascorbate) reduces
tocopherol and regenerates some of the radicals of vitamin
E. Vitamins E and C may thus have harmonizing antiox-
idant properties [233e235].
Vitamin E treatment increased cell survivability of rat
cortical cells (collected from CSF of ALS patients).
Reduced level of vitamin E was observed in spinal cord of
transgenic SOD1 mice. Vitamin E pretreatment protected
mutant SOD1 spinal cord cells of mice against glutamate
toxicity [236]. Daily oral administration of vitamin E
(dosed200 IU/d) had delayed disease onset and pro-
gression over control [237]. Dietary supplementation of
vitamin E marginally recovered the vitamin E levels in the
spinal cord of transgenic mice [238]. After the chemical

synthesis of vitamin E, it was used for the treatment of
encephalomalacia and muscle weakness [239]. It was
thought to have a beneﬁcial inﬂuence on the neuron. In
spite of some contradictory results, the recent ﬁndings
indicated that the onset of ALS was delayed in mutant
SOD1 transgenic mice after vitamin E treatment and
tocopherol may provide protection against SOD1 muta-
tions in patients with fALS [240]. Cohort studies of over 1
million
individuals
ﬁve
populations
recommended that long-term use of vitamin E supple-
ments could mitigate the risk of ALS [241].
Vitamin C (Vit C) is an important antioxidant molecule in
the brain. Vit C or L-ascorbate can reach tenfold higher
concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) than
plasma due to active transport [242]. At high concentra-
tions, vitamin C works as an antioxidant. In lower
concentrations, vitamin C works as a pro-oxidant and
induces production of hydroxyl radical in the presence of
excess amounts of transition metals (e.g., catalytic iron,
Fe) [243]. Vit C helps to maintain normal tissue homeo-
stasis and functioning of the CNS by modulating neuronal
differentiation, maturation, synthesis of catecholamine,
myelin formation, antioxidant protection, and modulation
of neurotransmission [244]. Since ALS is characterized by
increased free radical generation and the highest concen-
tration of Vit C in the body is found in the neuronal
tissues, it is proposed that Vit C may be used as a
potential therapeutic agent. In fALS, excess intracellular
copper ion may accumulate due to SOD1 mutations. In a
recent study, high dose vitamin C and the metal chelator
trientine were used for the treatment of mutant SOD1
transgenic mice. ALS symptoms were delayed by 16 days
after this treatment. Different studies have reported
beneﬁcial effects of using metal chelators and vitamin C
in combinatorial treatment in ALS [245,246]. In a
study by Nagano et al., it has been found that Vit C
treatment in fALS mice (in both pre and posttreatment
condition) increased the rate of survivability by 62%,
though that treatment did not affect the mean age of
disease onset [247].
Curcumin is a polyphenol found in turmeric (Indian food
coloring agent). Curcumin was found to hinder mutant
TAR DNA-binding protein-43 mediated excitability of
motor neurons in an ALS model [248]. Mutation of
TDP-43 was detected in fALS and sALS. Dimethoxy
curcumin (DMC) ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction
in mutated TDP-43 transfected cell lines. DMC could be
potentially useful as therapeutic agent against neurode-
generative diseases like ALS linked with mutated TDP-43
[249].
(600 mg/day)
in ALS patients was found to hinder disease progression
aerobic
damage [250].
Currently the exact molecular and cellular mechanism
responsible for initiation of neurodegenerative diseases is
not fully elucidated. The pathophysiological aspects of
neurodegenerative diseases are attributed to mutant protein
aggregate formation, their deposition in certain speciﬁed
brain region resulting in cellular stress response, excessive
generation,
neuroinﬂammation,
perturbance
neurotransmitter release, and neuronal cell death. The
above mentioned mechanisms lead to motor dysfunction,
dementia, depression, and other symptoms associated with
these diseases.
Analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanism
provides the idea of using nutraceuticals or dietary items
for therapeutic purposes. Many compounds (polyphenols,
ﬂavonoids, non-protein amino acids, etc.) found in daily
food possess antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory properties
modulate
molecular
crosstalk
involved with basic oxidative stress and inﬂammation.
However, certain limitations regarding poor bioavail-
ability, solubility, absorption in the intestine, and meta-
bolism of these polyphenols restrict their use for clinical
applications. Attempts are being undertaken to increase
their bioavailability using nanocarriers and other suitable
methods. Research outcomes of different clinical trials are
summarized below in Table 17.3.

Clinical trials using these molecules have been suc-
cessful to a certain extent but further detailed studies
regarding their ability to cross blood-brain barrier at every
stage of the disease and biopharmaceutical analysis are
necessary for their clinical applications in future.

COVID-19 pandemic
Recently,
novel
Coronovirus-2
(COVID-19)
reached pandemic scale in terms of both morbidity and
mortality on the global level, let alone its devastating
impact on disrupting the socioeconomic fabric worldwide.
As of June 8, 2020, World Health Organization is reporting
6,931,000
conﬁrmed
cases
COVID-19,
400,857 deaths [1]. The Central Disease Control (CDC),
USA, reports conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases to be around 2.3
million with 11% positive tests and overall mortality
exceeding 100,000 in late May 2020 [2]. In Canada with
one-tenth the population of USA, the mortality rate has
reached 7800 of COVID-19 patients [3]. Mitigation mea-
sures and public health surveillance strategies: “stay at
home,” “social distancing,” “Personal Protective Enve-
lope,” and ventilator in hospital settings have produced
positive results in ﬂattening the curve and stabilized the
pandemic crisis, especially in the USA and in Canada. USA

has the highest reported cases and mortality rate, followed
closely by United Kingdom, Italy, and more recently,
Brazil.
It is noteworthy that COVID-19 has only recently been
reported to spread in South America, primarily Brazil, and
to a certain extent to Russia and India. The elderly often
carry high comorbid medical diagnosis: diabetes mellitus,
cancer, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders. While
COVID-19 deaths are primarily related to acute respiratory
stress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis, [4],
recent studies have drawn attention to the emergence of
CNS involvement. In a recent study of 214 hospitalized
patients in Wuhan, China, 36.4% showed neurologic
symptoms (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness,
ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), and
even full-blown encephalitis syndrome [5]. There is a
paucity of data from Europe and North America on extent
of neurological impairment. Management of postacute care
involves coordination in addressing functional impairment
related to muscle weakness, physical deconditioning, car-
diopulmonary ﬁtness, gait balance.
The landscape of COVID-19 therapeutics is constantly
evolving. Conﬂicting clinical trial ﬁndings are reported for
the antiviral drug hydroxychloroquine. Hydrochloroquine
(HCQ) the antimalaria drug has drawn widespread publicity
both for prophylaxis and for the acute treatment of
ARDS; however, the multinational registry questions the
safety issue of HCQ regarding increased mortality and the
occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias risk [6]. In
the study using global big database: the Surgical Outcome
Collaborative Registry, from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe,
and North America, to evaluate the relationship of cardio-
vascular disease and the mortality rate among hospitalized
COVID-19 patients admitted between December 2019 and
March 2020, the investigators conclude that antihyperten-
sive drugs belonging to the class of angiotensin receptor
blockade
(ARB)
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
inhibitors (ACEinhibitors), carried no increased risk of
death [7]. The issue is whether ACE, angiotensin ACE-2,
the coreceptor of the spike protein of COVID-19, regu-
lates the attachment and replication of COVID-19 and
sensitive toward ACE-inhibitors and ARB, and whether
ACE-inhibitors and ARB therapy should be discontinued
amid COVID-19 pandemic. The complexities of cardio-
vascular control through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
pathways remain to be delineated better in translational
models of gene knockout of ACE-2. The editorial decision
of two highly prestigious peer-reviewed journals: Lancet
and New England Journal of Medicine to retract both
studies within 1 week based on the veracity of data source
and clinical trial methodology adds to the overwhelming
climate of fear and hypervigilance of the seriousness of the
COVID pandemic. Further controlled studies are currently
in progress to evaluate critically the role of HCQ in
COVID-19 and to establish the safety proﬁle of ACE-
inhibitors and ARB in COVID-19 cohort worldwide.
Similar apparently discrepant ﬁndings from two studies
in USA and China are reported with remdesvir (patented
product of Gilead Inc. Calif. USA) shown in vitro to inhibit
the viral polymerase and the proofreading exoribonuclease
[8e10], In the Chinese study, remdesivir use was not
associated with a statistically signiﬁcant difference in time
to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1$23 [95% CI 0$87-
1$75]);
remdesivir
seemed
accelerate
improvement rate to a nonstatistically signiﬁcant degree
[8]. On the other hand, the NIH funded USA study [9]
found that patients who received remdesivir had a 31%

those
who
received
(P < .001). Speciﬁcally, the median time to recovery was

remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received
placebo. The survival beneﬁt as shown in the mortality rate
of 8.0% for remdesivir-group versus 11.6% for the placebo
group (P ¼ .059).
With regard the convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT),
a recent review of ﬁve controlled studies [11] found evi-
dence of efﬁcacy of CPT therapy in reducing mortality in
critically ill patients [9]. The beneﬁcial effects are most
likely related to the increase in neutralizing antibody titers.
Disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in
post-CPT therapy.
In searching through the pipeline drugs with potential
efﬁcacy against COVID-19, we are not able to identify
speciﬁc drug lead targeting epigenetic signaling in COVID-
19 while counteracting the treacherous immunity hijacking
move by the COVID-19; and furthermore, recruiting
nanotechnology to enhance the efﬁcacy and minimizing
toxicity. In the concise synopsis, we attempt to characterize
the multifaceted pharmacology of curcumin to combat
COVID-19 and to describe the transformative roadmap

earmarked for oncology therapeutics in Phase I clinical
trial. Liposome-based curcumin: Lipocurc has the distinct
advantage over other anti-COVID drugs under investiga-
tion in that it readily penetrates through the BBB: blood-
brain barrier, and is active in translational models of
brain disorders including Parkinson disease (PD).
Curcumin pharmacology and
COVID-19
In the postgenomic era, there has been escalating interest in
epigenetics signaling involved in regulation of gene
expression in the context of diverse medical conditions and
disorders. In the aging process, epigenetics drift and

senescence explain the genome bias toward aging and
carcinogenesis [12]. Since COVID-19 exhibits age-speciﬁc
effect in triggering relentlessly a cascade of inﬂammation
and tissue damage leading to cell death, as shown by the
highest mortality rate in the elderly, the epigenetics
mechanisms in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric
disorders are directly relevant to our understanding of
COVID-19. The phenotype of Alzheimer dementia (AD) is
not only inﬂuenced by AD at-risk genes, but also buffered
by AD protective genes. It soon becomes evident that
epigenetics dysregulation underlies the pathophysiological
mechanisms of brain disorders: AD, PD, schizophrenia, and
mood disorders.
To reiterate, our overall objective of the drug develop-
ment platform is to transform curry spice and extract
liposome-curcumin
(patented
Lipocurc
pipeline
candidate SignPath Pharmac. Salt Lake City, Utah, USA)
through fusing nanotechnology with epigenetics signaling
and to develop an innovative milestone-driven drug
development program in the landscape of central nervous
system (CNS) and viral therapeutics development. Lip-
ocurc has ﬁled formal FDA patent for both cancer and CNS
brain disorders.
Very few CNS drugs possess antiviral properties.
Converging evidence suggests that curcumin functions as a
pan antiviral agent. While curcumin is active against viral
replication with reference to hepatitis C, HIV virus, inﬂu-
enza virus, dengue virus, Herpes simplex, prion virus, and
SARS-related coronavirus, very little has been invested to
further develop curcumin as a bona ﬁde broad-spectrum
antiviral agent exhibiting sustained drug effect against
viral resistance [13,14]. With the spread of COVID-19
outside China to Korea, Japan, and Europe, we have data
from the two PK studies to determine the maximum
tolerated dosage. A pilot Asian study conducted in Taiwan
found efﬁcacy of curcumin in reducing replication of
SARS-related coronavirus [15]. In the cell-based assay
measuring severe acute respiratory syndromeeassociated
coronavirus (SARS-COV) based on the cytopathogenic
effect on Vero E6 cells, curcumin was found to be a potent
inhibitor at concentration of 3.3e10 microM. Curcumin
inhibited the catalytic activity of SARS-COV 3CL protease
at 40 microM in vitro. The recent identiﬁcation of ACE-
2dangiotensin as the coreceptor of S-protein of COVID-
19 may lead to targeting ACE-2 for another therapeutic
avenue [16]. The controversies regarding the beneﬁts
versus risks of maintenance antihypertensive therapy with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and
angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) amid COVID-19
pandemic underscores the relevance of ACE-2 in patho-
physiology of COVID-19. In angiotensin IIeinduced
hypertension model, curcumin downregulates angiotensin
receptor in A10 cells through blocking angiotensin-
mediated vasoconstriction. Modulating the function of
ACE-2 in COVID-2 represents another novel target of
curcumin [17].

in China, found evidence for efﬁcacy of curcumin against
enteric coronavirus [18]. In the porcine epidemic diarrhea
virus (PEDV) model akin to coronavirus model, curcumin
was reinforced with uniform and stable cationic carbon dots
(CCM-curcumin) for investigating its antiviral properties.
The formulated CCM-CDs were pharmacologically active
through inhibiting viral entry, suppressing the synthesis of
the negative strand RNA of virus, and virus budding. It
appears to stimulate the inﬂammatory cascade involving the
interferon stimulating genes (ISGs) and proinﬂammatory
cytokines. It will be intriguing to compare the relative
efﬁcacies of CCM-CD and Lipocurc in the standard cyto-
toxicity, virus yield, and infection rate of COVID-19 virus
in vitro. COVID-19 belongs to the same family of beta-
coronavirus as MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Targeting epigenetics signaling may be the common
pathway underling MERS-COV and Inﬂuenza A/Vietnam/
123/2004 (H5N1-VN1203) inﬂuenza. Preliminary data
showed that both groups of virus: MERS-COV and H5N1/
VN1203 antagonize antigen presentation through epige-
netic
modulation
involving
methylation
[19].
Lipocurc may be the likely drug candidate to reverse virus-
induced antagonism of antigen-presentation of DNA epi-
genetics pathway.
Blockade of viral entry at the epigenetics doorstep can
be as efﬁcacious as antagonizing viral polymerase. The
ultrarapid rate of spread of COVID-19 remains an enigma.
COVID-19 likely adopts the all too familiar “trick” to
evade host viral defense through excessive activation of
endoribonuclease [20]. Under normal circumstances, viral
infection triggers the endogenous antiviral protective innate
immune defense system mediated through RNase-L. In
COVID-19 overactivation of RNase-L expression can lead
hyperinﬂammatory
condition
precursor
apoptosis and cell death. In this respect the ﬁnding that
curcumin inhibited RNase-L-activity through its antiin-
ﬂammatory and antioxidant properties may be interpreted
that the polyphenol counteracts the hijacked immune
responses and restores host viral defense. We are not aware
of any COVID-19 investigational agents exhibiting the
anti-endoribonuclease property.
There is growing evidence in support of the central role
of interleukin-6 in the “cytokine release storm” in ARDS,
the terminal event in COVID-19 [21]. Monoclonal anti-
body developed against interleukin-6 may hold promise in
improving COVID-19 core symptoms and reducing mor-
tality rate. Very few investigators are aware of the ﬁndings
of studies showing curcumin inhibit interleukin-6 [22].
While many drug trials on COVID-19 are launched to
combat COVID-19, few studies have adopted the repur-
posing paradigm to take advantage of the overlapping
immunity , epigenetics and angiogenesis targets in both
oncology drugs and anti-viral drugs. We propose to trans-
late the multi-faceted pharmacology of Curry extract from
the Tumeric longata to potential COVID-19 therapeutics
through recruiting the novel nanotechnology.
More signiﬁcantly, none of the pipeline antiviral drugs
has been shown to cross the BBB and exert beneﬁcial ef-
fects on brain health. This aspect of curcumin pharma-
cology is of prime importance with the increased attention
being drawn toward the spectrum of neurological symp-
toms [23,24], complicating cardiovascular and pulmonary
distress leading to death. During the postviral infection era,
the neurological and neuro-sequelae of COVID-19 are only
beginning to be recognized, let alone the guidelines for
navigating through the recovery phase.
Our choice of curcumin as an antiviral agent, and the
harnessing of nanotechnology to localize the site to
the brain regions, with the wealth of CNS studies on the
beneﬁcial effects of curcumin in enhancing brain health
[25,26] are unique and exceedingly positive as therapeutic
potential to restore brain health.
Nanotechnology, epigenetics, and PK
studies of liposome-curcumin
SignPath Pharma, PA owns the patent of the agent Lip-
ocurc and has agreed to provide the pharmaceutical for our
proposed clinical trial in PD. The curcumin component of
Lipocurc is originally synthesized at Sami Labs, Bangalore,
to 99.2% purity for the treatment of cancer. While SignPath
has taken the lead in carrying out oncology trials with
Lipocurc, our proposal will be the ﬁrst in organizing Lip-
ocurc trial in brain disorders. Despite numerous pharma-
cological studies with curcumin derived from Curcuma
longa, L. extract the major drawback in translating the
efﬁcacy of curcumin from preclinical models to clinical
arena of PD is the low systemic bioavailability of oral
curcumin usually available as dietary supplements due to
the high ﬁrst-pass metabolism [27e29]. SignPath Inc.
succeeded in utilizing an intravenous liposomal formulation
to optimize penetration across the BBB. For the past few
years, there has been almost explosive interest in searching
for brain-speciﬁc drug delivery system for CNS disorders.

applications in oncology as well as neurodegenerative
disorders [28]. SignPath Pharmac. (Salt Lake City Utah,
USA) has succeeded in formulating a patented liposome-
based curcumin shown to be bioactive in tumor models
and brain disorder models.
Curcumin has been identiﬁed as a potent modiﬁer of
epigenetics signal pathways at multiple sites: HDAC (his-
tone deacetylase) isoforms 1, 3, 8, HAT (histone acetyl-
transferase), noncoding RNA miRNA-22, miRNA186a,
and miRNA-199a [25,26,29]. Curcumin suppresses DNA

throughput epigenetic screening assay using HeLa nuclear
extract, curcumin was found to be more potent in inhibiting
HDAC than valproic acid and sodium butyrate. The inhi-
bition constant Ki of curcumin (539 nM) was comparable
to Ki of trichostatin A (504 nM). Curcumin is more potent
than valproic acid (Ki 564 nM) and sodium butyrate (Ki
365 nM). Cross-talks of HDAC with miRNA exert syner-
gistic effects in orchestrating and coordinating multiple
gene expression. HDAC inhibitors in controlling epigenetic
programming involved in affective regulation, and behavior
control, may alter the course of schizophrenia and bipolar
spectrum disorders through remodeling chromatin, histone-
related modiﬁcations, and even catalyze the access of gene
promoters to transcription complex.
Pharmacokinetic studies have been completed in three
species: rodents, dogs, and humans [30e34]. In the rodent
species, rats were given intravenous bolus injections three
times a week for 4 weeks (empty liposomes, and 10, 20,
and 40 mg/kg Lipocurc) [30]. In our study, we compared
the differential brain localization of three nanotechnology-
driven curcumin formulations in rats. Our results found
that following intravenous administration of liposomal
curcumin, polymeric nanocurcumin and polylactic glycolic
acid copolymer (PLGA)ecurcumin in rats, these formula-
tions were observed to cross the BBB using a sensitive
HPLC assay. All three formulations are localized in speciﬁc
sites in the brain without observable adverse events. One
hour following intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg nano-
curcumin or 20 mg/kg PLGAecurcumin or liposomal
curcumin, up to 0.5% of the injected material is localized in
the brain stem, the striatum, and the hippocampus with
varied accumulation and clearance rates. On the other hand,
we reported that dogs administered 1 h intravenous
infusions at 10 mL/kg/h for 4 weeks (5% dextrose in water,
empty liposomes, and 5 and 20 mg/kg Lipocurc) experi-
enced no adverse events [31,32]. For both the canine and
rodent species, there were no deaths on the study, and no
signs,
body
weight,
consumption, clinical chemistries, or organ weights, and no
treatment-related adverse effects. In view of the wide safety
margin, the NOAEL (no observed-adverse-effect-level: the
highest dose at which there was not an observed toxic or
adverse effect) for the rat was considered to be greater than
40 mg/kg dosage. For the beagle dogs [31,32] treated with
5 mg/kg Lipocurc, the analysis of all generated datad
observations,
ophthalmology,
ECGs,
pathology, gross necropsy and histopathologydconcluded
with no treatment-related toxicity.
The SignPath research group completed Phase I dose-
escalating study of Lipocurc recruiting subjects from
Europe (Study 1001) [33]. The protocol consisted of dose
escalation study of single infusions of Lipocurc over 2 h in
healthy volunteers allocated to ﬁve subjects/group (4 active
drug and l placebo) over nine dosage groups.10, 20, 40, 80,
120, 180, 240, 320, and 400 mg/m2. The results showed
that Lipocurc exhibited favorable tolerability and toxicity
proﬁle in normal subjects. We have fully characterized the
pharmacokinetic parameters of Lipocurc in humans. Blood
was collected at baseline, during the infusion at 15, 30,
90 min, at the end of infusion: 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min and
1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h for determining the total curcumin
and curcumin metabolitedtetrahydrocurcumin after the
EOI dose escalation was performed until the highest plan-
ned dose (400 mg/m2) was reached. Transient echinocyte
formation with no long lasting adverse effects was
observed. The infusion of Lipocurc resulted in rapid and
dose-dependent development of plasma levels of curcumin
with Tmax values ranging from 0.9 to 1.7 h. Cmax ranged
between 42  22 ng/mL and 2359  412 ng/mL for 10 and
400 mg/m2. Pharmacologically active metabolites have
been reported in previous studies.
The ﬁndings of a Phase II PK study conducted in
Europe reported similar safety and favorable tolerability in
a cohort of subjects diagnosed with metastatic tumors [34].
In the Phase I PK, single-center, open-label study, lipo-
somal curcumin was administered as a weekly intravenous
infusion for 8 weeks. Dose escalation was started at
100 mg/m2 over 8 h and the dose increased to 300 mg/m2
over 6 h. Results: 32 patients were treated. No dose-
limiting toxicity was observed in 26 patients at doses
between 100 and 300 mg/m2 over 8 h. Of six patients
receiving 300 mg/m2 over 6 h, one patient developed
hemolysis, and three other patients experienced hemoglo-
bin decreases >2 g/dL without signs of hemolysis. Phar-
macokinetic analyses revealed stable curcumin plasma
concentrations during infusion followed by rapid declines
to undetectable levels after the infusion. Antitumor activity
by RECIST V1.1 was not detected. Signiﬁcant tumor
marker responses and transient clinical beneﬁt were
observed in two patients. The study concluded that 300 mg/
m2 liposomal curcumin over 6 h was the maximum toler-
ated dose in the cohort of metastatic cancer patients who
were pretreated with chemotherapy for their cancer, and
300 mg/m2 is the recommended starting dose for future
randomized anticancer trials.
The safety data can instruct and guide Phase II/Phase Ib
studies to repurpose Lipocurc from oncology therapeutics
development to CNS therapeutics landscape for neuropsy-
chiatric disorders: schizophrenia, mood disorders, AD, and
PD, and more recently, COVID-19 infection. Signpath

COVID-19 brain rehabilitation: role of
epigenetics diet and exercise
We extend to acute lung injury resulting in acute respira-
tory distress syndrome (ARDS).driven by the cytokine
release storm [23,24]. As discussed earlier, recent evidence
highlights emerging CNS involvement, as shown in
case series studies of COVID-infected patients. Very
recently, COVID-19 infection has been found to increas-
ingly involve the CNS. A wide array of neurological and
neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described: anosmia,
ataxia,
epilepsy,
altered
level
consciousness
delirium, and myalgia [23,24]. Cognitive impairment and
mood changes are anticipated to occur following the acute
COVID-19 infection. Very few studies have focused on
rehabilitation in domains of cognitive, affective, and
behavioral domains.
Curcumin hits two arms of dysregulated immunity:
innate and adaptive immunity, in COVID-19 and will be in
a highly favored position to reset the homeostasis mecha-
nisms for both the acute and subchronic phase. As a tumor-
necrosis factor (TNF) and key regulator of family of
cytokines, curcumin is strategically positioned to arrest and
reverse the cytokine release storm. Curcumin participates in
shifting the phenotype of the main players of inmate and
adaptive immunity: macrophages, microglial cells (CNS),
and T-cell populations and B-cell populations, toward the
antiinﬂammatory and the antioxidant pathways, which in
turn are regulated by the epigenetics signaling [25,26]. The
frontier of epigenetics landscape has only recently been
rediscovered as contributing toward the pathological hall-
marks of COVID-19: virulence, transmission, and toxicity
at the end-organs: the pulmonary system, cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular system, and the CNS.
We have reviewed extensively the role of curcumin,
especially the liposome-based curcumin ad drug lead in PD
and AD [25,26]. The cognitive enhancing effects of cur-
cumin in ameliorating the functional decline in both PD and
AD are well delineated primary through the signal trans-
duction pathways downstream from the epigenetics hits of
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA
methylation.
Furthermore, in our study with supercurcumin we have
shown that oral formulation of curcumin not only improved
the negative symptoms but also the depressive symptoms of
schizophrenia [35]. Our results are consistent with the
ﬁndings of a systematic review of curcumin in depressive
symptoms of unipolar depression [36]. A metaanalysis of
curcumin in depressive disorder found that curcumin

COVID-19 viral syndrome embraces behavioral, cogni-
tive, and mood disturbances. Hence Lipocurc will be the
ideal drug candidate for both COVID-19 in the acute phase
and in the recovery phase.
Since curcumin is the bioactive ingredient of diet and
menu in Asia with increased popularity in the Western
world, our discussion calls into question whether curcumin-
enriched diet has beneﬁcial effect in counteracting the
cognitive affective and behavioral domains of post-COVID
syndrome. Growing evidence suggests that the epigenetics

diet-probiotics-prebiotics and therapeutic dance movements

Our choice of curcumin as an antiviral agent, and the har-
nessing of nanotechnology to localize the site to the brain
regions, coupled with the wealth of CNS studies on the
beneﬁcial effects of curcumin in enhancing brain health are
unique and exceedingly positive as therapeutic potential to
restore and enhance brain-behavior functions in the post-
COVID-19 period.

Future recommendations
Nutrition and diet have long been considered to be building
blocks of functional and healthy body. Feeding behavior is
closely associated with human civilization, and it is interesting
to understand the relationship between food intake and the
evolution of cognition pattern across the world [1]. Today, the
ﬁeld of dietary supplements has evolved very rapidly and is a
multibillion-dollar industry, with the ﬁgures estimated to reach
$60 billion by 2020 [2]. Further, advances in cell and mo-
lecular biology tools in the past decade have provided
biochemical evidence that indicate pivotal role of nutrients in
development and functioning of central nervous system.
Cognition as such is a broad term that refers to brain-
related processes that facilitate acquiring knowledge and
translate it into various emotions [3]. Cognitive health thus
relates to learning, memory, attention, consciousness, and
integrating all of these in daily activities. Nutrition and
dietary requirements have long been associated with mental
health, cognition, and neurodegenerative dysfunction and
disorders. In the past decade, the importance of nutrition in
maintaining neural tissue and membrane structure and in
brain signaling pathways is well elucidated.
Nutritional neuroscience has become a major research
area wherein there is concerted effort to prevent age-related
cognitive decline by advocating speciﬁc diet. More and
more beneﬁts are attributed to dietary inﬂuence leading to
cognitive performance such as learning, memory, and in-
tellectual understanding and processing. This is fathomable,
given the fact that synaptic functions can inﬂuence energy
metabolism establishing balance between cognition and
somatic functions [4]. In this context, it is key to note that
molecular mechanisms of energy metabolism as well as the
synaptic plasticity have a direct correlation to the dietary
factors that mediate them.
Molecular signaling of energy
metabolism and synaptic plasticity
Recent studies have focused more toward associating
nutrition to cognitive health and brain function at the mo-
lecular level. It is well established that the activities of brain
consume a signiﬁcant amount of energy. Mitochondria,
which are known as the powerhouse of the cell produce

energy in the form of ATP, play a critical role in devel-
opment and functioning of brain cells. In fact, mitochon-
drial dysfunction has been identiﬁed as a cause of several
neurological disease conditions including deﬁcient cogni-
tive function [1]. Further, management of energy is
orchestrated by interplay of nutrients that is processed and
managed by neurons with the aid of signaling molecules
(Fig. 19.1). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is
one such signaling molecule that is associated with both
energy metabolism as well as synaptic plasticity. Increased
BDNF is found in regions of brain with higher metabolic
activity (hypothalamus) and cognitive function (hippo-
campus) [5]. Certain studies have clearly indicated the
interrelationship between BDNF and brain-trigger activity.
For example, deletion of BDNF gene has resulted in
impaired memory [6,7]. Studies have also shown that
BDNF modulates a variety of triggers in energy meta-
bolism including glucose levels [8], lipid metabolism [9],
sensitivity
[10,11],
diminishing
appetite
[12,13]. Furthermore, it is critical to note that BDNF’s role
in energy metabolism and synaptic plasticity is tightly
regulated by insulinlike growth factor (IGF-1) which is
synthesized in liver, skeletal muscle, and brain and IGF-1
receptors are primarily expressed in hippocampus [14,15].
In addition to its involvement in regulating plasma insulin
levels and insulin sensitivity in brain, IGF-1 is also known
to have a role in nerve growth and differentiation, neuro-
transmitter synthesis and release [16], synaptic plasticity
[17], cognitive outcome following brain insult [18], dia-
betes [19] and aging [20]. IGF-1 also resurrects cognitive
function after brain injury [21] or insult and during aging
process [22].
Furthermore, BDNF is also known to stimulate perox-
isome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-
alpha (PGC-1a) in neurons. PGC-1a is a mitochondrial
activator that plays a critical role in the formation and
maintenance of the synapses [23].
Oxidative damage and cognition
It is abundantly chronicled that brain is susceptible to
oxidative stress and oxidative damage, as it contains large
amounts of poly unsaturated fatty acids that are oxidizable,
in the plasma membranes of neural cells. In the past decade
FIGURE 19.1
Interaction between feeding and cognition. Neural networks that control feeding also coordinates brain centers involved in energy
homeostasis and cognitive function. Ingestion of foods triggers the release of insulin and GLP1 which activates limbic system to activate signal that
promote synaptic activity and contribute to learning and memory. Ghrelin released by empty stomach also support synaptic plasticity and cognitive
function. Leptin released form from adipose tissue activate receptors in hypothalamus that inﬂuences learning and memory. Leptin also elevates BDNF in
hypothalamus that can inﬂuence food intake and energy homeostasis. IGF1 is produced by the liver and by skeletal muscle in response to metabolism and
exercise, activates hypothalamus and inﬂuences learning and memory performance. Diet and exercise can affect mitochondrial energy production and
release ATP, which activates BDNF and supports synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. The parasympathetic innervation of the gut by the Vagus
nerve provides sensory information to the brain, enabling gut activity to inﬂuence emotions related to cognition. BDNF, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor;

or so, relationship between antioxidants and modulation of
cellular mechanisms in brain has been well established
through a number of studies [24]. Lower antioxidant levels
in elderly institutionalized individuals had a pronounced
decline in cognitive performance [25]. Observational
studies have speciﬁcally shown a link between dietary
intake of selenium; carotenoids; vitamins A, C, and E, and
supplements known to have antioxidant activities in
improving cognitive health [26].
In addition, various micronutrients having antioxidant
functions that regulate mitochondrial function, which in
turn inﬂuences cognitive function.
Increased oxidative stress and inﬂammation are major
causes for cognitive decline in aging population. Studies
have shown that high energy requirement to maintain brain
functions constantly creates oxygen stress in brain leading
to neuroinﬂammation [27]. While reactive oxygen species
(ROS) help in cell signaling at physiological levels,
exceeding the optimum levels also result in homeostatic
imbalance leading to oxidative stress [28].
Nutrition and neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemicals that transmit
signals across synapse from one neuron to another neuron,
muscle, or a gland. Amount of neurotransmitter release is
generally dependent on changes in the composition of
blood plasma. These changes are induced by food intake or
extended physical activity. Common neurotransmitters
found in humans include acetylcholine (ACh), modiﬁed
amino acidsdglutamate and a-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
biogenic amines like dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT),
and histamine.
Dietary components are capable of affecting the mood,
which is due to the availability of neurotransmitter pre-
cursors [29]. Fruits, many edible plants, and roots are
sources of various neurotransmitters. For example, ACh is
found in plants belonging to almost all major economically
important plant families: peas, common beans, bitter or-
ange, wild strawberry, radish to name a few [30,31]. In
mistletoe (Viscum album), whose traditional use includes
hypertensive headache, epilepsy, hysteria and neurological
diseases, ACh is found in signiﬁcant amounts [30].
Glutamate is an important excitatory neurotransmitter
that is ubiquitous in food products. Glutamic acid is con-
verted into glutamate at a pH of 7 and is present in foods
that are high in protein content [32]. This includes meat,
seafood, cheese, mushrooms, spinach, and soy.
GABA is yet another inhibitory neurotransmitter found
ubiquitously in plants wherein it is synthesized from glu-
tamic acid via glutamate decarboxylase enzyme [33].
GABA levels particularly increase in response to stress
conditions such as drought, presence of salt, soaking, and
germination [34]. In addition, GABA is found in many
plant species such as beans, peas, mushrooms, and sweet
potato. Consumption of food rich in GABA results in
lowering anxiety levels in addition to having analgesic
effects.
Dopamine is associated with physical coordination of
body movements and is also shown to have antioxidant
activity [35]. Consumption of leaves of Mucuna pruriens
(velvet bean) has been shown to reduce parkinson’s
symptoms which is possibly attributed to the presence of
high levels of dopamine in it [36]. Dopamine levels are also
high in plantain, banana, and avocado [37].
Serotonin (5-HT), while in central nervous system
regulates behavior, sleep, and eating patterns, in gut, it is
associated with modulation of gastrointestinal motility.
Sources of 5-HT include Musa genus (ex: banana),
capsicum, hazelnut, tomato, and among fruits, pineapple,
plum, and passion fruit [38e40].
Another neurotransmitter, histamine, is a naturally
occurring nitrogenous compound present in hypothalamic
regions of the brain and is known for regulating arousal,
attention, response, and reaction. Histamine is endoge-
nously found in certain foods; in addition, defective pro-
cessing of food (e.g. cheese, dry meat products) may also
result in higher levels of the compound that may lead to
amine poisoning [41].
In addition to the natural food sources of neurotrans-
mitters, microorganisms also contribute to dietary avail-
ability of neurotransmitters. For example, Lactobacillus
species produce ACh [42] and GABA producing strains
have been isolated from Italian cheese [43], whole milk
[44] and soy sauce [45]. Furthermore, certain bacterial
strains such as Escherichia species, Morganella morganii,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus thermophiles
[46] are known to produce serotonin.
As of now, there are many isolated studies that
demonstrate existence of natural sources of neurotrans-
mitters. However, the signiﬁcance of dietary intake of
neurotransmitters needs to be established, as there is a
paucity of data with regard to their bioavailability and/or
clinical correlation.
Nutrition and brain well-being
An increasing body of information has emerged indicating
nutrition to be linked to brain health. It needs to be
acknowledged that multiple mechanisms such as genetic
factors, cell signaling pathways, and dietary factors are
intricately regulated, which in turn affect the cognitive
abilities. There are studies that have shown the relationship
between energy balance and mental health. While nutri-
tional deﬁciency has undesirable effect on the brain, over-
nutrition causes increased oxidative damage, decreased
synaptic plasticity, and impaired cognitive function [1]. In
this context, high energy diet coupled with sedentary

lifestyle is particularly deleterious leading to obesity and
diabetes. These attributes are directly related to impaired
cognition and have the potential risk of developing
depression and dementia [47]. It is well established that
dietary components can inﬂuence the brain processes by
regulating synaptic plasticity, synaptic transmission, and
membrane ﬂuidity [48]. Thus, there is an immediate need to
understand the importance of some of the critical nutritional
components that are associated with cognitive health and
function. Enlisted below are some of the nutritional ele-
ments that have a pronounced effect in cognitive health.
Fatty acids n-3 and n-6
Substantial role of fatty acids, a-linolenic acid (18:3n-3),
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5n-3), and docosahexae-
noic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3), has been enumerated in
cognition and mental health. DHA, in particular, is signif-
icant in maintaining the brain structure and function
[49,50]. DHA is a structural component of plasma mem-
brane of neuronal cells, which is vulnerable to oxidative
damage. Thus, availability of DHA in food is crucial for
optimal cell signaling in brain. It has been well established
that increased levels of brain DHA increases membrane
ﬂuidity
protein-lipid
thus
facilitating
neuronal activity and cognition. In contrast, decrease in
levels of DHA results in diminished learning and memory
due to impairment in neurogenesis and neurotransmitter
metabolism [48]. DHA also enhances synaptic plasticity
and energy metabolism thus triggering glucose utilization
[51] and mitochondrial function [52], while reducing
oxidative stress [53]. While role of n-3 fatty acids has been
shown to be beneﬁcial to cognitive health, it is also amply
demonstrated that trans and saturated fats are deleterious to
brain health and cognition [54]. Studies with rodent models
have indicated that food containing high levels of saturated
fat and glucose are deleterious to cognitive health charac-
terized by diminished memory and learning ability, as well
as decreased BDNF-related synaptic plasticity in hippo-
campus [55].
A study by Hooper et al. [56] showed that n-3 PUFA
supplementation had beneﬁcial effects in older adults with
low omega-3 index who were at risk of developing de-
mentia. In another study, it was observed that consumption
of seafood (containing omega-3 fatty acids) in adults aged
81.4  7.2 years was associated with slower decline in
memory, perception, and cognition [57]. Role of n-3 PUFA
in improving cognitive health in infants has also been
highlighted in a recent study [58].
Diet that provides a-linolenic acid includes vegetable
oils such as linseed, soyabean and rapeseed, and meat
products. Conversion of linolenic acid to EPA and further
to DHA is cumbersome and not recommended due to the
suboptimal yields. Thus, direct dietary intake of EPA and
DHA is preferred and the key dietary source of these fatty
acids is ﬁsh and ﬁsh oils. Recent efforts are also directed
toward enhancing dietary sources of n-3 fatty acids by
developing transgenic plants [59].
Polyphenols constitute a large family of compounds pro-
duced by plants that protect them from ultraviolet radiation.
Among the known polyphenols, ﬂavonoids and curcumi-
noids are conclusively linked to brain health and are
associated with several neuronal processes including syn-
aptic plasticity and energy homeostasis [60,61].
Flavonols, which belong to ﬂavonoid family are known
to have antioxidant effects and are found in a variety of
fruits, cocoa, beans, and Ginkgo biloba. By reducing
oxidative stress, ﬂavonols also play a role in reducing
learning and memory impairment during brain injury as
seen in cerebral ischemic rodent model [62]. Yet another
plant-derived ﬂavanol epicatechin has the ability to cross
the blood-brain barrier and is shown to enhance angio-
genesis and spatial memory in experimental murine
models. Further, ﬂavanols in conjunction with exercise has
proven beneﬁts in improving cognitive health [63].
The active component of plant turmeric, belonging to
curcuminoids family, is curcumin, which is handed down
as a traditional medicine in India [64]. There has been
substantial support to show the beneﬁcial effects of
curcumin in counteracting neurodegeneration as seen in
brain injury [65] and Alzheimer’s disease [66]. Curcumin
is also known to function as an antioxidant and thus
protect brain from free oxygen and nitric oxide radicals
and lipid peroxidation [67].
Vitamin B family
Among the class of vitamins, vitamin B has a substantial
role in modulation of brain-speciﬁc activities. Vitamins
belonging to the B family have a substantial role in enzy-
matic processes which are key mechanisms in routine
functioning of human physiology. B vitamins also serve as
important precursors for metabolic substrates; for example,
coenzyme A is a cofactor in about 4% of all mammalian
enzymes [68]. Furthermore, there is also evidence to show
that thiamine and biotin have signiﬁcant functions in the
mitochondrial metabolism of glucose [69] and fatty acids
[70], respectively. Studies have thus elucidated B vitamins
as contributors in both catabolic and anabolic energy pro-
cesses [71].
B vitamins inﬂuence brain function as they are actively
transported across the blood-brain barrier through speciﬁc
transport mechanisms. Thiamine (vitamin B1) provides
structural and functional stability of neurons and neuroglia
[72] and modulates the acetylcholine neurotransmitter

system [73]. Riboﬂavin (vitamin B2) and niacin (vitamin
B3) inﬂuence brain function by facilitating energy pro-
duction, protection from oxidative damage, DNA meta-
bolism and repair, and cellular signaling pathways. Wakade
et al. have shown that low-dose supplement of niacin
modulates niacin index and ameliorates Parkinson disease
symptoms [74]. It can be appreciated that most of the B
vitamins (e.g., pantothenic acid, pyridoxine) are involved in
the synthesis of multiple neurotransmitters which in turn
affect the brain functions. In addition, pyridoxine (vitamin
B6) regulates brain glucose levels [75], and in particular,
pyridoxal-50-phosphate is associated with severe inﬂam-
mation contributing to the pathophysiology of dementia
and cognitive decay [76].
Glucose
homeostasis
brain-
sensitive functions that are sustained by biotin (vitamin
B7) levels [77]. In case of vitamin B9 (folate) and vitamin
B12 (cobalamin), it is categorically established that they are
interlinked due to their complementary roles in folate and
methionine pathways and thus deﬁciency of vitamin B12
leads to putative deﬁciency of vitamin B9 [70]. It is
believed that folate deﬁciency leads to reduction in purine/
pyrimidine synthesis and methylation reactions in brain
leading to decreased DNA stability and repair, and hippo-
campal atrophy [78]. It is thus well documented that deﬁ-
ciency of Vitamin B causes multiple dysfunctions in
[79].
Mediterranean
particularly contain whole grains, eggs, olive oil, nuts,
seeds, leafy vegetables, and legumes are natural sources of
B vitamins and hence promote cognitive functions.
Carotenoids are phytochemicals that are ubiquitous con-
stituents in food. These have small, but substantial effect,
cumulatively, and work in synergy with many other food
components that aid in long-term well-being of cognitive
health. The brain-related beneﬁcial effects of carotenoids
are mainly attributed to their antioxidant effect and antiin-
ﬂammatory functions.
For example, some of the well-known carotenoids are
known to exert antiinﬂammatory response and reduce
oxidative stress in some body parts, thus arresting any
development,
prostate,
b-carotene in corpus luteum, lutein and zeaxanthin in
neural retina and brain neocortex [80]. Lutein is found in
the inner layers of macular region of the eye and is thus
essential for visual processing. Retina is part of the central
nervous system and lutein also accumulates in brain thus
improving the neural efﬁciency resulting in improved
cognition [81]. Lycopene is yet another carotenoid abun-
dantly present in several fruits including tomatoes and
watermelon.
shown
multiple
beneﬁts
including suppressing the production of inﬂammatory
cytokines, accumulation of amyloid plaques [82,83], and
accelerating glycolipid metabolism [84], in addition to be-
ing a potent antioxidant. Lycopene also confers neuro-
cognitive protection by mediating mitochondrial function
and inhibition of neuronal apoptosis [85].
Trace elements
Trace elements, an important component of diet, though
often overlooked, is well established in improving cogni-
tive health. It is amply shown in research studies that
Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), and Zinc (Zn) play a critical role in
neurodevelopment, neurotransmitter synthesis and homeo-
stasis, and signaling [86,87]. Dietary sources of Cu are
seafood, nuts, legumes, chocolate, and whole grains while
Zn can be found in lean red meat, seafood, and dairy
products [88]. Decrease in plasma Cu is associated with
cognitive decay in Alzheimer patients [89]. Zinc deﬁciency
is a major concern worldwide and affects 30% of the
world’s population. Lack of zinc in diet is associated with
cognitive decline in pregnant women [90]. Zn deﬁciency is
also directly linked to impaired memory, learning deﬁcits in
children, depression, and cognitive decline [89,91]. For
optimal functioning of brain, properly balanced food con-
taining trace elements is key; for example, excess Zn can
reduce Cu absorption that may lead to neurological disor-
ders. Among other trace elements, selenium (Se) may be
relevant for cognitive health, as it inﬂuences hormonal
activity and neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain [92].
Correlation between metabolic diseases
and psychiatric conditions
Perturbations in brain-related energy homeostasis are a
cause for the pathobiology of many neurological diseases.
Association between metabolic abnormalities and psychi-
atric disorders is also well documented. The brain with a
high rate of metabolism consumes up to 20% of total ox-
ygen available to body while accounting just for 2% of
body weight. Such a heightened need for oxygen is
attributed to the consumption of large amounts of energy by
neurons for maintaining and functioning of neuronal cell
membranes
neurotransmission
[93].
addition,
neuronal function and survival are critically dependent on
mitochondrial function and oxygen supply and thus mal-
functioning of mitochondria and oxidative stress lead to
serious damage such as in neurodegenerative disorders like
Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases [94]. Thus, metabolic
disorders such as diabetes and obesity are intricately
associated with the pathophysiology of most brain disor-
ders. In this context, it is relevant to note that rodents
treated with high fructose diet show increased triglyceride
levels and hepatic lipids [95]. It is also worthwhile to note


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 301

that fructose-induced metabolic syndrome reduces synaptic
plasticity, learning, and memory, thus compromising
cognitive health [96]. Prevalence of diabetes in manic
depressive patients has been shown in a study [97] and
similarly, diabetes mellitus in schizophrenic population has
also been presented previously [98]. All these studies and
current trends point to a strong correlation between meta-
bolic diseases and psychiatric disorders although there is no
conclusive cause-effect relationship that has been estab-
lished till date. BDNF is also believed to be a common
regulatory factor in both metabolic diseases and psychiatric
conditions. For example, low levels of BDNF in the plasma
are not only a result of impaired glucose metabolism and
diabetes [99] but also are seen in patients suffering from
depression [100] and schizophrenia [101,102].
Diet and cognitive health
Dietary factors coupled with environmental challenges at
various stages of life have a marked inﬂuence in cognitive
and emotional health in human beings. Obesity in devel-
oped countries and poor diet in developing countries are
serious concern which could be detrimental to mood and
cognition at various stages of human life cycle. It is
interesting to note that consumption of high fat diet in
early childhood or adulthood can prime the hippocampus
to trigger neuroinﬂammatory response causing memory
deﬁcits. On the contrary, intake of food high in poly-
phenols and antioxidants have the capacity to even reverse
age-related cognitive defects by lowering oxidative stress
and inﬂammation.
Early growth stage
Early nutritional factors have a long-term inﬂuence in
modulating incidence of mental disorders in humans. In
fact, studies have categorically shown effect of prenatal and
postnatal nutrition in development of mental disorders and
subsequent passage to further generations [103,104]. It has
been observed that children who were breastfed are likely
to demonstrate better cognitive performance [105]. This is
particularly relevant as neurodevelopment such as prolif-
eration of neuronal elements and neuroblast migration to
cerebral cortex occur during such early stages of human life
cycle. Thus, early nutrition is a determining factor of
cognitive function in later life. Placental insufﬁciency,
increased maternal glucocorticoids, and maternal deﬁciency
in micronutrients are potential factors that can affect
cognitive health in adult life [48]. It has also been shown
that poor nutrition in utero and in early postnatal life have
a lasting impact in metabolic and neural functions
including cognitive decay and accelerated brain aging
[106]. Early childhood metabolic complications are chief
inﬂuencers of cognitive development in adolescents. In
this connection, it is important to note that junk food diet
containing signiﬁcant fat content and sweetened drinks
result in weight gain and lead to metabolic complications,
which in turn result in poor cognition in adulthood [107].
Studies in animal models have proven beyond doubt that
high fat diet in rat and mouse during pregnancy and
lactation lead to diminished mood, depression, and anxi-
ety, all of which impact cognition [108]. These studies
conclusively demonstrate that brain’s high demand for
nutrients in early stages of development and dietary
imbalance impact neurodevelopment resulting in lasting
cognitive dysfunction [109].
Adulthood
Monitoring dietary habits in developed countries indicate
that there is increased consumption of saturated fats and
reﬁned sugars by adults. It has been shown that energy
intake in 12% of American adults come from saturated fats
while 13% derive energy from added sugars [110], which
is signiﬁcantly higher than what is recommended (5%
e10%) or optimal for healthy lifestyle. Such alarming
dietary habits have contributed to obesity in young adults
in the United States, which is now about three times more
than that prevailed in 1960 [111]. Obesity and other
metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes, as seen in earlier
section of this chapter, are strongly associated with
cognitive impairments and dementia. Research data has
pointed to the fact that food containing saturated fats and
high sugar content trigger neuroinﬂammatory responses
that may lead to cognitive deﬁcits [112]. Hippocampal
region of the brain is especially affected by high fat diet
triggers
neuroinﬂammatory
signals
impairing
hippocampus-dependent memory. In a study by Beilharz
et al. [113], rodents were either given a normal (control)
diet or a high-fat and/or high-sugar diet. The results
showed a marked impairment in memory in the latter two
groups as compared to the control. Attention deﬁcit and
reduced retrieval of information are also related to high fat
diet. Although the mechanism by which the neuro-
inﬂammatory responses affect the hippocampus function
is not clear, it is believed that high fat diet may sensitize
the microglia of the brain, thus triggering the inﬂamma-
tory response that ultimately compromises the hippo-
campus [114,115].
Among the immune cells in brain, microglia have a
major role in mediating cognitive function. Their key
function is to trigger immune response and phagocytose
pathogens in injured brain cells [116]. However, excess
secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines by activated microglia
may lead to cognitive dysfunction resulting in decrease of
neurotrophic factor and IGF-1.
Thus, it is abundantly clear that cognitive health is
ﬁrmly regulated by diet pattern in an adult’s life.

Cognitive enhancers
It is rather antithetical to say that wisdom comes with
“age,” but the brain most certainly slows down and
cognitive functions decline with aging. Thus, a more recent
development is in the ﬁeld of cognitive enhancers, also
called as nootropics or smart drugs, which are believed to
ﬁght back the “slowing down” process. Cognitive en-
hancers include brain training in the form of computer
programs, drugs (e.g., modaﬁnil), nutritional supplements,
exercise, and meditation.
Use of computer-aided video games for improving
cognition in children and older adults has been shown in
some studies. For example, a multitasking version of a
video game played for 12 h over a period of 1 month
showed signiﬁcant enhancement in cognitive tests of sus-
tained attention and working memory [117]. Some of the
cognitive functions that have been measured and shown to
indicate improvement include visual attention, cognitive
control, short-term memory, and processing speed [118].
Although,
commercially,
video
gaming
enhancer is a burgeoning industry, critiques have been
skeptical and have indicated that there is limited evidence
supporting the idea of digital media in rendering beneﬁcial
effects on real-world cognitive health.
With regard to exercise and meditation, these are ac-
tivities that can discipline the mind resulting in enhanced
cognitive performance. But their recommendations are
equivocal and are personalized rather than based on
evidence.
Apart from nutritional supplements that have been dis-
cussed in the current chapter, there has not been proven
scientiﬁc evidence that back the rest of the aspects that are
suggested as cognitive enhancers.
Active sports and cognitive
performance: role of nutritional
supplements
Cognitive health is critical for performance in professional
sports. For that reason, these cognitive enhancers are also
seriously researched in sports science to increase agility,
reaction time, focus, and motor skill. Certain nutritional
supplements have demonstrated beneﬁts in enhancing
motor skill and cognitive health that is discussed here.
Branched-chain amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine,
and valine are associated with mitigating fatigue during
prolonged exercise plausibly by reducing serotonin syn-
thesis in brain [119]. Furthermore, Hassmen et al. have
demonstrated that consumption of carbohydrate solution
with branched-chain amino acids by runners during
competition improved cognitive performance after 30 km
as against consuming the one without branched-chain
amino acids. It is however interesting to note that such
improvement is related only to more complex cognitive
tasks such as attention and showed no change in lesser
physically demanding tasks such as short-term memory
[120]. Despite encouraging results, use of branched-chain
amino acids beneﬁting endurance in athletes is still a hy-
pothesis and is not currently recommended as a perfor-
mance enhancer.
Caffeine is a naturally occurring substance chemically
identiﬁed as trimethlyxanthine and is found in coffee,
guarana, chocolate, kola nut, and certain other plants. There
are many studies that have pointed to the beneﬁcial effect
of caffeine in sports-related activities, especially those
related to skill and endurance. For example, passing accu-
racy
soccer
players
vastly
improved
consumption of 6 mg caffeine (per kg body mass) as
against placebo just an hour before the start of the game
[121]. In contrast, certain studies have indicated lack of
beneﬁt of caffeine on motor skill performance and reactive
agility [122,123]. These were mostly studies related to
simulated sports situations, which are notionally different
from real-life situations, which may be the reason for the
discrepancies. It is likely that the beneﬁt of caffeine is more
pronounced in situations where physical or mental fatigue
is present, like toward the latter half of the game [121,124].
Ginseng species, some of which include Panax ginseng,
Panax quinquefolius, Panax notoginseng, and Eleuther-
ococcus senticosus are triterpene saponins suggested to be
involved in modulating performance-enhancing effects on
cognition. Effects of ginseng are especially pronounced in
active individuals, such as sports persons, who are under
physical stress or fatigue [125]. However, conclusive ef-
fects are still lacking to recognize ginseng as a supplement
in boosting cognitive health, especially in athletes.
Among ﬂavanols, cocoa is a plant product primarily
containing
epicatechin
trace
amounts
epi-
gallocatechin. In a crossover study, cocoa ﬂavanols showed
beneﬁcial effects with regard to cognition and visual
function in cocoa ﬂavanolsefed groups as against the
placebo group, when fed to healthy adults at 520, 994 mg,
or placebo [126]. Yet another study has reported similar
results wherein consumption of dark chocolate (720 mg of
cocoa ﬂavanol) improved cognitive performance when
compared to ingestion of white chocolate (negligible
amount of cocoa ﬂavanol) [127]. It is believed that the
mechanism by which cocoa facilitating cognitive perfor-
mance and visual function may be related to increased brain
perfusion [128,129].
Despite encouraging results in certain studies, the evi-
dence to support cocoa as a dietary supplement in
improving cognitive performance is still sparse and needs
further conﬁrmation.
Yet another natural product with ﬂavanol content is
G. biloba extract from the leaves of maidenhair tree which
is a native to China. Other components in this herb include


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 303

terpenoids and terpene lactones [130]. G. biloba extracts
are widely used as nutritional supplements for their sug-
gested activity in increasing cerebral blood ﬂow, reducing
blood viscosity and as scavengers of free radicals [131].
However, there is paucity of information with regard to
Ginkgo’s effect as cognitive enhancer in active sports.
Rhodiola rosea is yet another dietary constituent that
facilitates enhanced cognitive function, especially under
fatigue and stress conditions. R. rosea has an array of
constituents including ﬂavonoids, phenolic acids, tri-
terpenes, and monoterpenes [132] and is shown to improve
attention, speed, and accuracy. It also impacts the quality of
mental work than the quantity of work completed [133].
The body of literature on the acute effects of R. rosea on
physical performance in athletes is sparse and yet to be
substantiated with more research data.
In addition to the above discussed naturally occurring
components, sage (Salvia ofﬁcinalis), L-theanine, theobro-
mine, and tyrosine are a few other natural supplements that
have some effect in improving cognitive health [125].
Except caffeine, most others, however lack scientiﬁc sup-
port to enable meaningful use as supplements to cognitive
performance in active sports.
Diet and epigenetics
Among the many research attributes that have delved into
brain health, more recent focus has been in the areas of diet
and nutrition inﬂuencing epigenetic events that potentially
transmit across generations. Epigenetic events, including
nongenetic components like DNA methylation, control of
transcription,
acetylation,
post-
translational modiﬁcations have the capability to cause
phenotypic changes resulting in disease modulation. Studies
have been few in this topic, but there has been signiﬁcant
data to show that BDNF can undergo signiﬁcant changes
bringing about epigenetic modulations affecting cognitive
functions. Differential expression of speciﬁc BDNF splice
variants as a result of chromatin modiﬁcations has been
shown in Alzheimer patients [134]. A recent study in rodent
model of depression has shown consistent changes in his-
tone acetylation and methylation at the site of BDNF pro-
moter during depressive state and upon administration of
antidepressant [135]. However, the role of diet and lifestyle
changes in triggering DNA signaling in brain that impacts
cognitive functions is yet to be studied in detail.
Nutraceuticals as key drivers for brain
The above account clearly indicates that many of the food
components have a fundamental role in protecting the brain
and sustenance of its function. Our daily routine coupled
with work-related stress may have damaging consequences
leading to decay of the signaling components associated
with neuro transmission. Recent research focus in food
science has facilitated development of nutraceutical in-
terventions resulting in related nutraceutical products/sup-
plements. This is also driven by formulation technologies
that aid in delivering sufﬁcient quantities of the active
components that protect against speciﬁc damage causing
agent or help in reversing the pathology of the condition.
Formulation science also plays a vital role in delivering the
active nutraceutical as a single agent or as a combination in
a sustained manner that may help in reversing some of the
brain-related functions, which are being explored at various
scientiﬁc levels.
Future recommendations
There have been many studies pointing to the relationship
between nutrition and short/long-term effects on brain and
cognitive health. Collective data obtained in the past decade
or so is promising and should be very useful in developing
key dietary interventions leading to beneﬁcial cognitive
health. Most research data obtained in this area has become
the premise for food and nutrition industry to develop high-
quality products for consumption. The next steps in this
area will be to develop evidence-based natural products that
can play a direct role in correcting or preventing certain
cognitive conditions.

Diet, cognition, and dementia
The role of diet and nutrients in brain health and the risk of
developing dementia has been gaining interest over recent
years. Early literature focused on how different nutrients
and individual food groups were related to cognition
[6e8]. Based on evidence from multiple cross-sectional
studies various nutrients including B-group vitamins and
omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with better
cognitive and brain health [9,10]. However, these ﬁndings
have often not been translated into positive ﬁndings
following randomized-controlled trials investigating the
supplementation of the individual nutrients [11]. Due to
the complex interactions that occur when combining
different nutrients and food groups, more recent research
has focused on whole dietary patterns and cognition [6].
Various dietary patterns have been examined in relation to
improved cognitive health. The 2017 Lancet Commission
on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care [12]
highlighted the potential for the Mediterranean diet as an
interventional strategy to delay the onset of dementia and
slow cognitive decline.
Assessment of Mediterranean diet
The Mediterranean dietary pattern is characterized by a
high intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, ﬁsh, breads,
cereals, nuts, and legumes. There is a low to moderate
consumption of dairy and poultry, while red meat is
consumed in low quantities only. Olive oil provides the
main

current consensus of the Mediterranean diet is shown in

most
commonly used measure is the MedDi score [3]. This
captures intake on a food frequency questionnaire and
scores it against sex-speciﬁc group medians. For “MedDi-
positive” components, including fruit, vegetables, grains,
nuts, legumes, monounsaturated fatty acid to saturated
fatty acid ratio, consumption above the median is awarded
one point and consumption below the median is assigned a
value of zero. “MedDi negative” components, including
dairy and red meat, are reverse scored with consumption

lower than the group median awarded one point. In total,
individuals are scored on a 10-point scale ranging from
zero (low adherence) to nine (higher adherence) [3].
Panagiotakos and colleagues calculated an alternative
MedDiet score from a food frequency questionnaire based
on frequency of intake, rather than against sex-speciﬁc
medians. Each component was assessed on a 5-point
scale, with a maximum score of 55 indicative of high
adherence to a Mediterranean diet. More recently a
14-item questionnaire (MEDAS) has been developed from
the PREDIMED trial [13]. This was one of the ﬁrst
questionnaires speciﬁcally designed to measure adherence
to a Mediterranean diet, and due to its shorter length,
offers greater clinical utility.
Mediterranean diet and cognition
across the lifespan
There is considerable evidence from population-based
studies suggesting that the long-term effects of adherence
to a Mediterranean-style diet can protect against the devel-
opment of dementia as well as preserve cognitive and brain
function (See Table 20.1). Several epidemiological studies
have found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet appears
to be protective against developing mild cognitive impair-
ment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). Findings from the
longitudinal Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging
Project (WHICAP) demonstrate that higher adherence to the
Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced risk of AD
[14] after a follow-up period of 4 years. Similarly, results
from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle
Study of Aging (AIBL) demonstrate that poor Mediterra-
nean diet adherence was a signiﬁcant predictor of developing
MCI and AD [15]. A more recent study, the Rush Memory
and Aging Project, found that highest adherence to a Med-
iterranean diet was associated with reduced incidence of AD
when compared to lower adherence [16].
In addition to reducing the risk of developing AD and
dementia, adherence to the Mediterranean diet has also
been linked to better cognitive performance in healthy older
adults. The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences
in Stroke (REGARDS) [17] study used a longitudinal
design to investigate the relationship between a Mediter-
ranean diet and cognitive performance in healthy adults
aged 45 years or older. It was found that higher adherence
to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower
likelihood of cognitive impairment after a 4-year follow-up
period. Similar results were found in the Chicago Health
and Aging Project (CHAP) [18]. Adherence to the Medi-
terranean diet was linked to slower rates of cognitive
decline as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) over 7 years. The MMSE is a brief assessment of
global cognition that is commonly used for screening
cognitive function [19]. Many studies investigating the
relationship between cognition and adherence to the Med-
iterranean diet have used the MMSE [20e22] and found

signiﬁcant relationships. However, the literature suggests
that more sensitive measures of cognition should be used to
ensure that the relationship between diet and cognition in
the early stages of cognitive decline is also captured
[23,24]. An increasing number of recent studies investi-
gating the links between adherence to the Mediterranean
diet and cognition have utilized cognitive assessments that
are sensitive to the different aspects of cognition that
deteriorate with age [21,25e27]. The Australian Imaging,
Biomarkers and Lifestyle study used a thorough cognitive
assessment battery that included tests of cognitive domains
known to deteriorate with age, including verbal memory,
visual memory, executive function, language, attention, and
visuospatial functioning [25]. The study found that in-
dividuals with genetic predisposition to cognitive decline
who had higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet adapted
to an Australian population had less decline in executive
function over a 3-year period. Conversely, those adhering
to a more typical Western style diet (higher in processed
foods, reﬁned sugars, and red meat) had increased decline
in the visuospatial domain. In the Memory and Aging
Project (MAP) study, cognitive assessments were made
using 19 tests of cognitive performance, with overall higher
adherence to the Mediterranean diet related to a slower rate
of global cognitive decline [21]. Assessing the different
cognitive domains, especially those more associated with
age-associated cognitive decline, allows a better under-
standing of the complex relationship between cognition and
diet. Further, the use of age-sensitive measures of cognition
may reveal the onset of these relationships and help
determine the optimal time window for intervention.
Several longitudinal studies have also failed to ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant relationship between adherence to the Medi-
terranean diet and cognitive function [28e32]. The het-
erogeneity of the ﬁndings across the different longitudinal
studies may be due to the confounding effects of different
cognitive outcomes and different scoring methods used.
Further, a common limitation of longitudinal trials is the
failure to measure dietary intake at follow-up. These
studies have used a dietary measure at baseline to observe
relationships between baseline Mediterranean diet adher-
ence and cognition at follow-up, typically spanning 5e10
years later. This rests on the assumption that individuals’
diets are consistent over the follow-up period which is
often not the case. Particularly in an aging group,
dietary modiﬁcation is common due to loss of spouse,
appetite, or disease-instigated changes [33], and therefore
may confound the results. Further, some studies fail to
measure cognitive performance at baseline, for example,
the French Supplementation with Vitamins and Mineral
Antioxidants
(SU.VI.MAX)
only
assessed
function at follow-up. This is a common issue in these
large population studies, as some may only add cognitive
assessment to the cohort at a later stage in the study.
In order to overcome these limitations and explore the
mechanisms underpinning the purported beneﬁts of a
Mediterranean diet on cognition, a number of randomized-
controlled trials (RCTs) investigating Mediterranean diet
interventions have been conducted. Further, the addition of
measures of nutrient status, oxidative stress, and inﬂam-
matory biomarkers may help us understand the mechanisms
which underlie the relationship between dietary adherence
and cognitive and behavioral changes. The RCTs involving
Mediterranean diet interventions for cognition are sum-
marized in Table 20.2.
A small pilot study by McMillan et al. [34] investigated
the effects of a 10-day Mediterranean diet intervention on
mood and cognitive performance in healthy young women.
Utilizing a between-subjects design, the study found that, in
comparison to participants who did not change their diet,
those on the Mediterranean diet had improved mood.
Cognitive effects were mixed, with improved reaction
times for spatial working memory but worse performance
on other tasks (numerical working memory and work
recognition. In a partial replication of this trial, Lee et al.
[35] conducted a 10-day crossover-design Mediterranean
diet intervention for healthy young women. This trial
supported the mood ﬁndings of the pilot study. In this case
Mediterranean diet was associated with better performance
on word recall tasks (though again, worse performance on a
numerical working memory task). Collectively, these
ﬁndings suggest that the beneﬁt of a Mediterranean diet on
cognitive functioning may be more robust in older popu-
lation, or those with cognitive impairment. More work is
needed in younger adults to evaluate whether the Medi-
terranean diet can optimize cognition in the short-term and
potentially acting as a protective factor across the lifespan.
In terms of chronic interventions of Mediterranean diet,
the PREDIMED trial [36] and associated substudies have
been major contributors to our understanding of Mediter-
ranean diet beneﬁts for cognitive function. Based in Spain,
participants were selected for having major cardiovascular
risk factors and followed the intervention over several years
while undergoing periodic cognitive tests and screening for
MCI and AD. After 4 years, following a Mediterranean diet
supplemented with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) or nuts
was associated with improved composite measures of
cognitive function [26]. At 6.5 years, cognitive perfor-
mance was signiﬁcantly higher for those with in the
EVOO-rich Mediterranean diet group in comparison to the
control diet, in addition to signiﬁcantly less incidence of
MCI than controls.
As found in longitudinal observational studies, sub-
group analyses of the PREDIMED study support the
interaction of Mediterranean diet with genetic risk factors
for AD. After 6.5 years, a signiﬁcant interaction was
found between adherence to Mediterranean diet and
speciﬁc genetic risk factors (Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele),

suggesting that the Mediterranean diet may be able to
modulate the effects of these genetic risk factors on
cognitive decline [37]. This rapidly developing ﬁeld of
epigenetics offers a promising approach whereby the
expression of nonmodiﬁable genes may be altered, and
potentially attenuate biological processes underpinning
the etiology of AD.
At the time of writing, there is an ongoing 12-month
Mediterranean diet intervention [38] in individuals with
cardiovascular risk factors in Spain. While the primary
outcome of this study is to reduce cardiovascular risk,
secondary outcomes include cognitive measures, reiter-
ating the importance of Mediterranean diet for cognitive
health and recognition of this relationship as gaining
traction in the ﬁeld. To the authors’ knowledge, there have
only been three chronic RCTs conducted in nonclinical
adults outside of Europe: the MedLey study [27], the
Lifestyle Intervention in Independent Living Aged Care
(LIILAC) [39,40], and MedPork Randomised Controlled
Trial [41]. All three of these trials were conducted in
Australia. Interestingly, there was no beneﬁt of a 6-month
Mediterranean diet intervention for cognitive function in
healthy adults aged 65 years in the MedLey study [27].
The researchers attributed this result to possible ceiling
effects for the cognitive outcomes. This study also di-
verges from PREDIMED in terms of the length of inter-
vention. As the effect of diet is likely cumulative across
the lifespan and the effect sizes are relatively small
compared to pharmaceutical studies, these factors may
have limited the ability to detect a beneﬁt for cognition
[24]. However, the 8-week intervention of Mediterranean
diet supplemented with 2e3 weekly servings of fresh lean
pork was observed to result in improved processing speed
when compared to low fat controlled diet in 45e80 year
olds [41]. The results of the 6 month LIILAC intervention
have just recently been published, while no signiﬁcant
change was observed in overall cognitive performance;
performance on the spatial working memory task was
improved in the combined exercise and Mediterranean diet
group when compared to the control group [40].The
LIILAC trial was a pilot for the MedWalk trial; a multisite
study investigating the combined effects of a Mediterra-
nean diet and walking intervention in independent living
older adults over 2 years. Collectively, the results of the
prospective longitudinal and RCTs suggest that Mediter-
ranean diet may help protect against dementia and help
maintain healthy cognitive function.
Mechanisms and food components
There is a considerable evidence suggesting that the
Mediterranean diet has a positive impact on the brain.
However, the mechanisms of this relationship are not well
understood. It has been suggested that antiinﬂammatory
and antioxidant properties of the Mediterranean diet
[1,2,4,42,43]
health [44], which, in turn, improve cognitive function.
There is a well-established relationship between poor
cardiovascular health an increased risk factor for later
dementia [45]. There is also substantial research linking
both hypertension and arterial stiffness to impaired
cognitive performance [42,46,47]. While a hallmark of
aging, an increase in arterial stiffness reduces the capacity
of the vessels to dampen the pulsatile ﬂow created by the
heart with each beat [46,48]. The consequence of this
increase in blood ﬂow pressure into the smaller capillaries
within the brain may cause progressive small vessel
damage and cognitive deﬁcits [47]. In addition to arterial
stiffness, cerebrovascular disease is another risk factor for
cognitive decline and often occurs comorbidly in in-
dividuals with AD [49]. As several cardiovascular pa-
rameters are risk factors for dementia [45], the beneﬁcial
effects of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular health
may consequently improve brain health into old age.
Many studies have suggested that the protective beneﬁts
of the Mediterranean diet may be attributed to beneﬁcial
inﬂammation.
Both
oxidative stress and inﬂammation play a role in the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and dementia (for
a review see Ref. [50]).
In addition to poor cardiovascular health, metabolic
syndrome has also been linked to cognitive decline and
dementia [51,52]. Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of
different metabolic disorders including central obesity and
any two of the following: raised triglycerides, reduced
HDL cholesterol, increased blood pressure, raised fasting
plasma glucose [53]. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet
has been reported to reduce the incidence and risk of
metabolic syndrome [54]. Another metabolic disorder that
has been found to impact cognition is the development of
type 2 diabetes [55,56]. The connection between the
development of type 2 diabetes and the risk of AD is now
considered so strong that AD is often considered a
neuroendocrine disorder, or type 3 diabetes [57e59].
Further, impaired glucose control even in the healthy
range has been linked in increased cognitive decline [60].
A systematic review conducted by Esposito, Maiorino,
Ceriello, and Giugliano [61] reported that adhering to a
Mediterranean diet may help prevent the development of
type 2 diabetes and improve glucose control.
Finally, another possible mechanism that the Medi-
terranean diet may exert beneﬁts on brain function is
Brain-Derived
Neurotrophic
factor
(BDNF).
BDNF is a protein that is synthesized in neuronal tissue,
vascular endothelial cells, pancreatic cells, and in smooth
and skeletal muscle cells. It is thought to play a role in
synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, neuronal health, and
differentiation [62,63]. The PREDIMED trial found that


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 316

adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with
an improvement in plasma BDNF concentrations in those
with depression [64].
Collectively, it appears that there are multiple vascular,
metabolic, and inﬂammatory pathways that mediate the
relationship between the Mediterranean diet and cognition
[50]. This may be due to the combined effects of a range of
components of the Mediterranean diet. The following sec-
tion will highlight the speciﬁc dietary components of a
Mediterranean diet that may be particularly important for
brain health and underpin these mechanisms (Fig. 20.2).
Olive oil
While a broad range of food groups contribute to a tradi-
tional Mediterranean diet, olive oil appears to be a signif-
icantly important component. It is rich in monounsaturated
fatty acids and polyphenols and may be responsible for
many of the cardiovascular beneﬁts associated with this
dietary proﬁle. A large prospective study of over 40,000
participants found that there was 44% decrease in mortality
caused by cardiovascular disease after 13 years in in-
dividuals with high olive oil consumption [65]. Further
evidence for the protective beneﬁts of olive oil have been
described in subset of participants in the PREDIMED
study, participants who adhered to the Mediterranean diet
intervention with olive oil had performed better on ﬂuency
and memory tasks and had lower rates of MCI when
compared to the control group [66]. This cognitive
improvement was not observed in participants in the
Mediterranean diet and nuts condition. The PREDIMED
study suggests that a Mediterranean diet rich in EVOO may
beneﬁt cognitive health. However, as the study design
failed to assess baseline cognitive status, there is a need to
replicate these ﬁndings.
Oily ﬁsh, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and sardines are
rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to exert
antiinﬂammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective
properties [67,68], as well as increased cell membrane
ﬂuidity [69]. Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (LC-PUFA) include both eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These include
long-chain DHA and EPA, which cannot be synthesized
efﬁciently within the body, and therefore it is important that
these nutrients are consumed as part of an individual’s
regular diet. Fatty acids are a key component of the Med-
iterranean diet that distinguishes it from other dietary pat-
terns [50]. Overall, there is a great amount of evidence that
circulating omega-3 levels in blood and dietary intake of
omega-3 are related to cognitive performance [10,70].
However, the evidence from RCTs is mixed [71,72]. These
varied ﬁndings may be due to the heterogeneity of the
cognitive assessments used leading to reduced effect seizes
in the meta-analysis [71].
Nuts
Tree nuts and legumes are nutrient-dense foods containing
monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA)
FIGURE 20.2

fatty acid proﬁles; protein; vitamins; and other nutrients
known to have a number of health beneﬁts including
cognitive function [73,74]. Participants in the nurses’
Health study (nHs) were found to have modestly better
cognitive performance at old age (70þ years), when they
had higher nut intake; however, nut intake was not related
to cognitive decline [74]. As discussed earlier, the PRE-
DIMED study did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of the
Mediterranean diet intervention on rates of MCI when
compared to the control group [66]. Overall, there are only
a few clinical trials on the effects of nut intake on cognitive
function; while nuts may contain essential nutrient com-
pounds, more research is needed to conﬁrm its relationship
with cognitive outcomes [75].
Fruits and vegetables
A higher intake of fruits and vegetables has been associ-
ated with higher blood nutrient levels, lower oxidative
stress, and better cognitive function [76]. Increasing fruit
and vegetable intake over a period of 3 months was shown
to improve nutrient levels in healthy individuals [77].
Consumption of fruits and vegetables or a diet that is
supplemented with antioxidants, serum carotenoids, vita-
mins, ﬁber, and magnesium has been shown to reduce
C-reactive protein [78], a marker of inﬂammation closely
linked to cognition [79]. Furthermore, ﬂavonoids and
polyphenols found in fruit and vegetables provide both
cardioprotective and neuroprotective properties [67,68].
Research by Devore and colleagues [80] demonstrates that
higher intake of food high in ﬂavonoids, such as berries,
reduced the rate of cognitive decline in older adults. In a
prospective cohort of 921 participants, part of the he Rush
Memory and Aging Project (MAP), higher intakes of
dietary ﬂavonols were associated with reduced risk of
developing dementia after 6 years follow-up [81]. Fruits
and vegetables are also high in carotenoids. A recent
review of two carotenoids lutein and astaxanthin found
that three of the ﬁve studies reviewed reported that lutein
intake signiﬁcantly beneﬁted cognitive performance on
serval domains [82]. As the Mediterranean diet is rich in
these fruits and vegetables, these polyphenols are a
possible component of the Mediterranean diet that con-
tributes toward cognitive beneﬁts.
Each of these dietary components has been reported to
contribute positively to cognition and general health.
However, one must consider that dietary patterns such as
the Mediterranean are very complex, and the interactions
between these food groups, or synergy, may provide ben-
eﬁts to cognition that are not demonstrated to adhere to one
component alone. Thus, equal weighting of each food
component when scoring adherence to a Mediterranean diet
provides an inadequate picture of how the complex nature
of diet provides beneﬁts to brain health.
Practical translation into Western
countries
The dietary pattern typically consumed in Western coun-
tries, commonly termed as a “Western diet,” varies greatly
from a Mediterranean pattern. Western diets are charac-
terized by a greater amount of processed, discretionary
foods which are low in micronutrients. It is therefore un-
surprising that adherence to a Mediterranean diet in
Western countries such as Australia, the USA, and UK is
much lower than traditional Mediterranean countries. To
address this, researchers in non-Mediterranean countries
have developed several modiﬁed interventions which are a
hybrid of the Australian Dietary Guidelines and Dietary
Guidelines for Adults in Greece [83,84]. In the Framing-
ham cohort, measurement of a Mediterranean-Style Dietary
Pattern Score considered not only overconsumption of
foods within the Mediterranean diet but consumption of
foods not identiﬁed as part of the Mediterranean diet [85].
This is an important issue, as traditional scoring methods of
Mediterranean diet fail to address other components of diet
that may detrimentally impact cognition and therefore
“washout” any beneﬁcial aspects from adhering to a
Mediterranean diet. That is, an individual may consume
high amounts of Mediterranean diet constituents, but also
consume large amounts of processed foods, which could
have deleterious effects for cognition. In a novel analysis
by Shakersain [86], adherence to both a healthy “prudent”
diet (high in fruits, vegetables legumes, and ﬁsh) in parallel
to adherence to an unhealthy “Western diet” (high in
sweated beverages, reﬁned grains, processed foods, and
sweets) was assessed in 2223 dementia-free participants
aged 60 years and older. They then measured cognitive
performance 6 years later, reporting the cognitive decline
associated with a Western diet was attenuated when in-
dividuals also had high adherence to a prudent diet. Thus,
detrimental aspects of an unhealthy diet on cognitive health
may be reversed when a healthy diet is also adhered to.
Born from this concept is a new dietary pattern devel-
oped by Prof Morris of RUSH University, termed the
Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative
Delay (MIND) diet [87]. As the name suggests, the Med-
iterranean diet was a model for the MIND diet. However,
this diet model considers intake of deleterious foods such as
processed foods and sugars. This is particularly important
in translation for Western countries where these eating
patterns are more prevalent. Preliminary ﬁndings from
these researchers observed the top tertile of adherence to
the MIND diet was equivalent to being 7.5 years younger in
age when compared to the lowest tertile [88].
Understanding the mechanisms underpinning a Medi-
terranean diet is pivotal in order to provide robust evidence
for implementation in
public health
guidelines. The
increasing trend for individuals, particularly in Western

countries, to use nutraceutical formulations to compensate
or “prop up” for nutritional inadequacies not met through
diet further complicates the understanding of the relation-
ship between cognitive function and Mediterranean diet.
There is a growing consensus that use of dietary supple-

especially
individuals with a suboptimal nutritional status (including
psychological and cognitive health). It is therefore impor-
tant that not only additional supplements are controlled for
in future trials, but the baseline nutrient status of partici-
pants entering the trial is determined. While dietary sup-
plements are appealing due to their low-effort, the beneﬁts
reaped from dietary interventions may be more favorable
than supplements due to the synergistic beneﬁts of overall
improved diet quality. Further, detailed cost-analysis of a

depression in Australia found that adoption of a modiﬁed
Mediterranean diet was more ﬁnancially affordable than a
poor-quality diet [89]. Therefore, the applicability of a
Mediterranean diet for Western countries is not only
feasible, but an important intervention that should be
implemented to slow the detrimental impacts of cognitive
decline in the aging population.

Recent advance: nasal delivery of CA extract
Centella asiatica (L.) Urban (family: Apiaceae), popularly
known as Gotu kola, is a plant indigenous to Southeast
Asia, India, Sri Lanka, parts of China, the Western South
Sea Islands, Madagascar, South Africa, Southeast USA,
Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, and Eastern South America
[1]. C. asiatica whole plant, mainly leaves (hereafter
referred as CA), has been used traditionally as a brain tonic
in traditional ethnobotanical medicine [2]. In Indian tradi-
tional system of medicine, Ayurveda, CA is mentioned as
“Medhya Rasayana” and documented as nerves and brain
cells revitalizer [3]. The plant is classiﬁed as Class 1 herb
(one that can safely be consumed when used appropriately)
in the American Herbal Products Association’s Botanical
Safety Handbook [4].
CA has been reported to have variety of medicinal
wound
healing,
antiinﬂammatory,
antipsoriatic antiulcer, hepatoprotective immunostimulant,
cardioprotective, antidiabetic, cytotoxic and antitumor, anti-
viral, antibacterial, insecticidal, antifungal, antioxidant, and for
leprosy and venous deﬁciency treatments [1,5e16]. This
activity proﬁle of CA is extensively reviewed in dedicated
monographs published by World Health Organization
(WHO) [17] and Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products
(HMPC) [18]. Furthermore, comprehensive monographs
describing the wide variety of medicinal properties of CA
and its phytoconstituents namely European Pharmacopeia
Commission E of the German Ministry of Health [3], Alter-
native Medicine Review [19], and Natural Medicines
comprehensive database [20] have been published. Further-
more, pharmacological activity proﬁle of CA as whole plant,
leaves, or extract is extensively reviewed in past literature
[1,5,6,8,10,13,14,16,21e24]. Review of medicinal properties
of separate phytoconstituents of CA (e.g., pentacyclic
triterpenoids,
ascitic
acid)
published
[12,23,25,26]. CA contains large quantities of pentacyclic
triterpenoids
glycosides
collectively
known
centelloids. These terpenoids are secondary metabolites
of CA and include mainly glycosides (asiaticoside,
madecassoside, centelloside, brahmoside, brahminoside,
thankuniside, sceffoleoside) and their aglycone acids

(asiatic-, madecassic-, brahmic-, centellic-) (Fig. 21.1) [22].
These secondary metabolites are suggested to be respon-
sible for a wide range of pharmacological activities of
CA [23].
Although, CA is traditionally used for beneﬁcial
effects on nervous system such as nervine tonic, rejuve-
nator, anxiolytic, mental stress reliever, and for producing
calmness and enhancing memory and intelligence [24],
medicinal
disorders has not been reviewed in the past except
neuroprotective effects [2]. In addition, the extensive
medicinal properties and mechanisms of CA against a
speciﬁc range of neurological and psychological disorders
have not been reviewed. The present chapter is the focused
review of the published reports of efﬁcacy, safety, prob-
able mechanism of actions of medicinal properties of CA
and derived phytoconstituents against a wide range of
neuropsychological disorders such as mood, anxiety,
epilepsy,
stress-related
disorders,
migraine,
ischemia, neuropathy, and others.
Efﬁcacy against mood and depressive disorders
The antidepressant activity of ethanolic extract of CA was
reported at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg against forced
swimming test (FST) in rodents [27]. The ethanolic and
aqueous extract of CA (100 mg/kg, oral, single dose) was
reported to have signiﬁcant, dose-dependent effects of
reducing the number of marbles buried without affecting
the motor activity in marble-burying model in mice [28].
Marble-burying model is a speciﬁc animal model that uses
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) behavior [29].
Furthermore, OCD is characterized by recurring obses-
sions and compulsions that signiﬁcantly interrupt the
daily functioning of the patient with comorbidity and
major depression considered as an anxiety disorder [30].
Depression frequently accompanies OCD and appears to
affect treatment outcome negatively [30].
The antidepressant activity of total triterpenes from CA
leaves in FST has been reported [31]. Total triterpenes from

CA leaves reduced the immobility time and ameliorated the
imbalance of amino acid levels similar to positive control,
imipramine [31]. Additional experiments demonstrated a
signiﬁcant reduction of the corticosterone level in serum
and increase of levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT),
norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and their metabolites,
namely 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 3-methoxy-
4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in rat brain and amelio-
ration of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis as a possible mechanism behind the antidepressant
activity of total triterpenes from CA leaves [32].
The potential antidepressant properties of asiaticoside,
a major triterpenoid of CA leaves, demonstrated antide-
pressant-like effects in male mice. On oral administration,
asiaticoside (10 and 20 mg/kg) showed signiﬁcant anti-
depressant-like
terms
augmenting
frequency of grooming behavior splash test in the unpre-
dictable chronic mild stress (CMS) model, and decreased
immobility time (tail suspension test, and FST).
Antidepressant-like activity of another triterpene con-
stituent from CA leaves, madecassoside, is reported [33].
Acute (3 days) and subacute (21 days) intragastric
administration of madecassoside showed reversal of
depression-like
FST
reserpine antagonist test at intragastric administration (10,
20, and 40 mg/kg) [33]. Furthermore, the activities of
monoamine
oxidase-A
(MAO-A)
monoamine
oxidase-B (MAO-B) in different rat brain regions were
also determined. The result indicated that the antidepres-
sant effects of madecassoside through MAO inhibition in
the rat brain were stronger with acute administration than
chronic administration [33].
The potential of CA leaves extract on the age-related
decline in cognitive function and mood disorder in the
healthy elderly was shown during the pilot, 8-week,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study [34]. A
capsule containing a specialized aerial part of CA extract
(containing asiaticoside and asiatic acid) at daily doses of
250, 500, and 750 mg for 2 months was administrated to 20
healthy elderly subjects [34]. Cognitive performance was

battery
event-related potential [3,35]. The mood-related parameter
was BondeLader visual analog scale [36] that was assessed
before the trial and after single, 1, and 2 months after
treatment. CA extract showed signiﬁcant efﬁcacy on
cognitive function (shown by the signiﬁcant increase in
event-related potential elicited by oddball at Fz electrode)
and mood (increased calmness and alertness) [34].
Asiatic acid, a triterpenoid of CA leaves, at 30 mg/kg
dose, on acute, intraperitoneal administration, is reported to
be an antidepressant in FST [37]. Asiaticoside, a major
triterpene of CA leaves, demonstrated antidepressant-like
effects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in
C57BL/6 mice [38]. Asiaticoside, on 4 weeks of treatment
(10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, oral), showed dose-dependent
reversal that decreased sucrose preference and increased
immobility time shown by CUMS mice. Additional
experiments suggested the role of hippocampal braine
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling activation as
a possible mechanism of antidepressant-like action of asi-
aticoside [38]. BDNF plays a vital role in the neuronal
regulation not only in depression but also in suicidal
behavior [39]. On the background of evidence of side
effects of suicidal tendencies in vulnerable patients by
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors types of antidepres-
sant, the DBNF-derived mechanism of antidepressant
action of asiaticoside seems promising.
However, the major milestone was reached when the
antidepressant activity of the specialized total terpenoids-
based standardized extract of CA leaves (INDCA) was
reported in the olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) model in rats
[40]. Subacute (14-day) oral pretreatment of INDCA (3,
10, or 30 mg/kg) showed dose-dependent reversal of
OBX-induced parameters such as gain in body weight and
food intake increase. Similarly, OBX-induced hyperac-
tivity in the open ﬁeld and elevated plus-maze paradigm
was signiﬁcantly reversed by subacute oral treatment of
INDCA [40]. These ﬁndings are signiﬁcant because OBX-
induced rat model is a well-validated animal model for
depressive disorders [41], which mimics the slow onset of
antidepressant action reported in clinical studies [41], and
has proven speciﬁcity in the mechanism of antidepressant
activity [42], especially after chronic administration [43].
addition,
INDCA
demonstrated
efﬁcacy
depression [40] as well as social isolation, stress-induced
depression, and suicidal behaviorerelated traits in labo-
ratory rats [44]. Subacute (14-days) treatment of INDCA
(3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, oral) showed a reversal in suicidal
behaviorerelated traits (aggression, irritability, active
avoidance in learned helplessness) and raised levels of
serum cortisol (a stress hormone) [44].
The systematic review of ﬁve randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) on CA alone and six RCTs of CA containing
products were reported [45]. The results suggested positive
effects in improving mood by increasing alertness and
decreasing anger scores at 1 h after treatment [45]. None of
the studies reported adverse effects of CA. However, the
result of a systematic review is limited by variation in dose
regimen and preparations, thus highlighting the need of
standardized extract for the scientiﬁc studies for reliable
and conclusive evidence [45].
Efﬁcacy against anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety, panic dis-
orders, phobias, or post-traumatic stress disorder, are
common and a signiﬁcant cause of disability. Anxiety is
also a crucial component of many other psychiatric or

medical conditions [46]. CA has been used in traditional
medicines for centuries to treat a range of psychological
conditions such as anxiety, and used to provide relaxation
to assist meditation [47]. CA has also been documented in
Ayurvedic preparations for the treatment of mental fatigue
and anxiety [48]. The review of plant-based anxiolytic
medicines that provide clinical and/or preclinical evidence
[47] listed CA leaves extract as proven anxiolytic on acute
as well as chronic administration [49e51].
The preliminary evidence of anxiolytic effects of acute
treatment of CA leaves is reported in the year 2000 in a
randomized placebo-controlled clinical study [49]. The 20
subjects on CA leaves (12 g, single dose) treatment
demonstrated signiﬁcant reduction in the peak the acoustic
startle response amplitude, 30 and 60 min after treatment as
compared to 20 subjects on placebo treatment without
affecting self-rated mood, heart rate, or blood pressure [49].
The other clinical evidence for anxiolytic action was
reported in an open-label clinical study for 70% hydro-
ethanolic extract of CA leaves (500 mg/capsule, twice
daily, after meal) on 33 subjects of a generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD) [51]. CA leaves extract demonstrated
anxiolytic potential in the stress, depression and parameters
for willingness for adjustment and cognition [51].
The anxiolytic effects of acute treatment of methanol
extract (3047 mg/kg) and ethyl acetate extracts (111 mg/kg)
of CA leaves, as well as the asiaticoside (1, 3, or 5 mg/kg,
in peanut oil), were reported [52]. Ethyl acetate extract and
the methanol extracts were administered orally in 50%
condensed milk, and the asiaticoside was administrated in
peanut oil. The effect was demonstrated across a variety of
anxiety paradigms, including the elevated plus-maze test,
open ﬁeld test, social interaction test, locomotor activity,
Vogel test, and novel environment test. Furthermore, the
asiaticoside did not affect locomotor activity, suggesting
nonsedative nature.
Extracts from CA leaves were among few extracts that
showed positive GAD stimulatory activity by over 40% at
a dose of 1 mg/mL during in vitro rat brain homogenate
assays [53]. A large body of published research has
demonstrated the role of altered glutamate transmission in
anxiolytic
action
many
paradigms
preclinical animal and clinical drug trials [54]. The
phytoconstituents from CA leaves extract are suggested to
interact with glutamic acid decarboxylase to inﬂuence
brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels and neurotrans-
mission [53] to demonstrate anxiolytic activity in various
animal models [52] and clinical studies [49,51]. The
reported dose-dependent increase in g-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) levels in rat brain by CA leaves extract during
in vivo study [55] is also in line with the postulated role of
GABA in anxiolytic action of CA leaves.
The anxiolytic efﬁcacy of standardized ethanolic extract
of CA leaves (77% triterpenoid fractions of which 43.74%
were madecassoside, and 33.26% was asiaticoside) was
reported against 72 h of sleep deprivationeinduced anxiety
in male mice [56]. Sleep deprivation is being considered a
classic sign and marker for anxiety [57]. On the other,
anxiety disorders are known to cause sleep disturbances
and disrupted sleep architecture [58,59]. Eight days of
treatment at 150 and 300 mg/kg showed protective effects
72-h
sleep
deprivationeinduced
anxiety-like
behavior, oxidative damage, and neuroinﬂammation with
possible involvement of nitric oxide (NO) modulation [56].
Both in vitro and in vivo research have found asiat-
icoside to be the main anxiolytic constituent [32,52].
Research in rats has linked triterpenes in CA to increased
brain levels of 5-HT, NE, and DA together with reduced
serum corticosterone levels [32] and cholinergic mecha-
nisms [60]. Triterpenoid glycosidesebased standardized
extract of CA leaves is reported to have anxiolytic activity
on stress-induced anxiety in chronic immobilization
model during ex vivo electrophysiological properties
between intercalated cells [61]. The anxiolytic effect was
shown to be mediated by increasing activation of excit-
atory synaptic input to the GABAergic intercalated cells of
the amygdala leading to depression of the central nucleus
of the amygdala neurons [62].
The asiaticoside (10 mg/kg, oral, single dose) demon-
strated the anxiolytic activity in male mice by using
experimental paradigms of anxiety namely elevated plus-
maze test, light/dark test, and hole-board test without
altering
total
locomotor
[50].
Another
triterpenoid from CA leaves, asiatic acid, is also reported as
anxiolytic by potential modulation of the GABA-A receptor
[37]. Acute intraperitoneal pretreatment of asiatic acid
(30 mg/kg) alone and in combination with known GABA-A
agonist, Flumazenil (3 mg/kg), or a benzodiazepine, Mid-
azolam (1.5 mg/kg), showed signiﬁcant anxiolytic activity in
the elevated plus-maze model in rats [37].
Efﬁcacy against Stress-related disorders
Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably. How-
ever, there is an overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress
is related to the same “ﬁght, ﬂight, or freeze” response as
anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress
may be very similar. Therefore, it is not surprising that CA
has the antistress and anxiolytic potential to relieve
different types of stress and anxiety conditions respectively.
BDNF is an important mediator of neuroplasticity
(neurogenesis and neural remodeling). It is a known pro-
tector of the nervous system from the harmful effects of
chronic stress [63]. Ethanolic extract of CA leaves is
reported to prevent the decrease of hippocampal BDNF
concentration in hippocampus upon chronic stress [64].
The subacute administration (28 days) of ethanol extracts of
CA leaves (150, 300, and 600 mg/kg, oral) increases

memory performance and serum BDNF concentration. It
decreases NO levels in rats after chronic electrical stress
[64]. The role of restoration of hippocampal BDNF in the
antidepressive-like action of chronic asiaticoside treatment
against stress-induced depressionlike symptoms in mice has
been demonstrated [38]. Furthermore, BDNF is suggested
to be a strong link in the relationships between altered
cytokine
[65],
well
inﬂammation with impairment of memory [66,67]. The
recent study on subacute administration of ethanolic extract
of CA (600 mg/kg, oral) on chronic electrical stress showed
lowest levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines and tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and highest DBNF levels in the
hippocampus [68]. These reports conﬁrmed the anti-stress
effects of CA extract through modulating hippocampal
proinﬂammatory cytokines and BDNF [68].
CUMS has been shown to induce depression-like
behaviors in rodents, which exhibit similarities to the
human form of depression [69]. Decreased expression of
BDNF, with altered synaptic morphology and reduced
neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats that were
exposed to CUMS, has been reported [70,71]. Asiatico-
side was reported to have anxiolytic effects in acutely
stressed animals [50,52] and immobilized stress-induced
anxiety models [61,62]. Anxiolytic effects of triterpe-
noid glycosidesebased standardized extract of CA after
chronic immobilization stress in mice have been reported
[61]. The triterpenoid glycosidesebased standardized
extract of CA (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, oral) and separate
phytoconstituent, madecassoside or asiaticoside (10, 20 or
100 mg/kg, oral) showed signiﬁcant antistress effects in
elevated plus-maze test and open arm tests against chronic
immobilization stressed mice [61]. However, the extract
but not separate phytoconstituents (madecassoside or
asiaticoside) could reverse the changes in serum cortico-
sterone levels in stressed mice [61]. Recently, unstan-
dardized CA extract (400 and 800 mg/kg) was shown to
reverse the anxiety (open ﬁeld test and elevated plus-maze
test) and depression-like behaviors (FST), amnesic be-
haviors (maze spontaneous alternation test), and reduced
serum cortisol levels in CUMS-induced rats [72].
Ethanolic extract of CA (300 and 600 mg/kg, 4 weeks)
is reported to enhance memory function after chronic
electrical
[73].
Triterpenoid-based
standardized
extract of CA (150 and 300 mg/kg) treatment for 8 days
starting 5 days before 72 h of sleep deprivation in mice is
reported enhanced locomotor activity, antianxiety-like
effect, reversed mitochondrial enzyme complex activities,
attenuated corticosterone level as well as improved neuro-
inﬂammatory and apoptotic responses, a pyknotic cell
density [74]. These mechanisms are thought to be mediated
through NO modulation and subsequent cascading effect on
mitochondrial insufﬁciencies, as well as antistress, antiin-
ﬂammatory, and inactivation of neuro-apoptosis pathways
[74]. INDCA is reported to ameliorate CMS-induced
cognitive impairment in rats [75]. Oral administration of
INDCA (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) during the last 2 weeks of CMS
showed signiﬁcant protection from cognitive impairment in
object recognition test, object location test, and open ﬁeld
test (OFT). Furthermore, INDCA showed a signiﬁcant
reversal of CMS-induced anhedonia during the sucrose
preference test.
Potential beneﬁts of CA on diabetes-induced stress in
the kidney and brain of rats are also reported [76].
Subacute administration of methanolic extract of CA (500
and 1000 mg/kg, oral) reduced the oxidative stress and
proinﬂammatory markers such as TNF-a and interferon-g
(IFN-g), increased antiinﬂammatory markers interleukin
10 (IL-10) in kidney and brain of streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rats [76].
Efﬁcacy against Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a major disorder of the aging
population, is becoming a major healthcare problem [77].
The value of the natural products in the treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, has been
reviewed by many researchers in the past [78,79]. Many
phytoconstituents namely ﬂavonoids, alkaloids, and tri-
terpenes from diverse natural plant sources have been
reported for their possible efﬁcacy against many aspects of
cognitive deﬁcits, especially AD [80e82].
An aqueous extract of CA is reported to be effective in
preventing the cognitive deﬁcits, as well as the oxidative
stress in the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin-model
of AD in rats [83]. Twenty-one days of oral treatment at
100, 200, and 300 mg/kg showed a dose-dependent
increase in cognitive behavior in both passive avoidance
elevated
plus-maze
paradigms.
(300 mg/kg) was reported to reverse the oxidative stress
markers in the brain homogenate [83].
Mechanism through b-amyloid
Accumulation of extracellular b-amyloid plaques, intra-
cellular hyperphosphorylated tau tangles, generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to mitochondrial
genetic
mutations,
subsequent
aberrant
signaling, and neuronal cell death reported to cause cogni-
tive defects and behavioral and psychological problems in
patients of AD [80]. An important role for b-amyloid in the
cascade of events results in the neurodegenerative changes
responsible for the memory loss and behavioral changes
associated with AD [84,85]. Furthermore, inﬂammatory
responses and autophagy have been implicated in the
amyloid-b (Ab) aggregation in AD due to recycling cellular

waste and eliminating toxic protein aggregates [86]. The
CA extract has been reported to impact the amyloid cascade
altering many aspects of Ab pathology in the brains and
suggested as a possible management option for AD
[87e89].
The water extract of CA demonstrated enhanced phos-
phorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein
(CREB) in neuroblastoma and cortical cell cultures [90].
The mechanism of action behind ameliorating the cognitive
impairment in rat models of AD by CA extract was sug-
gested from in vitro study in a neuroblastoma cell line
expressing amyloid beta Ab(1e42) and in rat embryonic
cortical primary cell culture [90]. This signiﬁcant increase
in CREB phosphorylation is in line with other reports on
CA extract with increased neuronal dendritic arborization
and axonal regeneration in rats [91,92].
CA extract is reported to reduce the amyloid cascade
in the brains of PSAPP mice (a type of double transgenic
mice) [87]. CA extract (2.5 or 5.0 g/kg/day) on prolonged
treatment, starting at 2 months of age before the onset of
detectable
deposition
up
8 months, was found to cause signiﬁcant decrease in Ab
(1e40) and Ab (1e42) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), reduction in Congo Red stained ﬁbrillar
plaques
(microscopy),
activity in vitro, scavenging free radicals, reducing lipid
peroxidation, and protecting against DNA damage in
brain homogenate [87]. Furthermore, CA extract (25, 50,
and 100 mg/mL) was shown to protect PC12 and IMR32
cells against Ab [1e40]-aggregation induced neurotox-
icity through to modulation of the antioxidative defense
system [93].
The water extract of CA (devoid of the asiatic acid
component) was reported in vivo to improve behavioral
deﬁcits in a Tg2576 mouse, a murine model of AD with
high Ab accumulation [94]. Two weeks of treatment with
water extract of CA in the drinking water reported
normalizing the Morris water maze and open ﬁeld behav-
ioral deﬁcits typically observed in aged Tg2576 animals
[94]. Notably, the water extract of CA treatment did not
alter Ab levels in the brain, suggesting that CA may act
downstream Ab formation to mitigate the toxic conse-
quences. Furthermore, protection of SH-SY5Y cells and
MC65 human neuroblastoma cells in vitro from toxicity
induced by exogenously added and endogenously gener-
ated Ab, respectively, are also reported [94]. In the next
series of experiments, mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acids
(CQAs) in water extract of CA were identiﬁed and shown
effective in vitro against SH-SY5Y cells and MC65
human neuroblastoma cells against Ab-induced cytotox-
icity [89]. These compounds not only showed mitigation
of Ab-induced cell death but were able to attenuate
Ab-induced alterations in tau expression and phosphory-
lation in both cell lines similar to water extract of CA [89].
The water extract of CA is also reported to attenuate the
mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in isolated
Ab expressing hippocampal neurons [95] and Ab-induced
neurodegenerative spine loss and dendritic simpliﬁcation
[96] in Tg2576 mice and wild-type littermates. These
reports suggest water extract of CA and several of the
compounds found therein can correct many underlying
causes of Ab exposure to improve cognitive functions
observed in vivo [87,94] and indicate a broader therapeutic
utility of the extract beyond AD.
The methods, such as ﬂuorescence correlation spec-
troscopy (FCS), were used to elucidate the mechanism of
asiaticoside-induced inhibition of Ab(1e42) ﬁbrillation
[97]. The FCS is a proven method that can detect
molecular motion at the nanomolar levels [98] and
recently attracted interest for investigating the molecular
interactions of proteins [99] including Ab(1e42) of
ﬁbrillation interactions with molecules [100]. The asiat-
icoside showed inhibition of the early stages Ab(1e42) of
ﬁbrillation, leaving more free Abs in the solution and
permitting their rapid diffusion in the confocal volume
(FCS study), reduced ﬁber formation (steady-state) during
kinetic ThT ﬂuorospectroscopy, laser-scanning micro-
scopy, and transmission electron microscopy study [97].
Furthermore, in silico molecular docking study showed
binding of asiaticoside with Ab intra- and intermolecular
amino acid residues, which are responsible for b-sheet
formation and longitudinal extension of ﬁbrils [97].
Madecassoside, another major triterpenoid glycoside of
CA leaves, is reported to offer neuronal protection
through Ab [25e35]-induced inﬂammatory responses and
autophagy in neuronal cells [86].
Aluminum is a ubiquitously distributed environmental
toxicant that lacks biological function. However, its
accumulation in the brain has been demonstrated to be
linked to several neuropathological conditions, particu-
larly AD [101]. A series of reports suggested that asiatic
acid could be able to modulate various pathological
features of AD and could hold promise in AD treatment.
Asiatic acid (10 nM) in vitro is reported to provide

pathway [102]. Furthermore, the neuroprotective potential
of oral asiatic acid (100 mg/kg, 42 days) is reported
against aluminum chloride (AlCl3)einduced neurotoxicity

ance task, ascitic acid is shown to increase the activity of

conﬁrmed the role of Akt/GSK3b pathway activation in
downregulation of the expression of cyclin-dependent
kinase 5 (CDK 5-enzyme implicated in the phosphoryla-
tion of tau proteins), phosphorylated tau (pTau), oxidative
stress, and apoptosis as the mechanisms behind the
efﬁcacy of ascitic acid against spatial memory deﬁcit,
anxiety, and motor dysfunction using AlCl3-induced
neurotoxicity model in rats [104].
Mechanism through neuronal outgrowth
promoting action
Ethanolic extract of CA in drinking water (300e330 mg/kg,
daily) reported rapid functional recovery and increased
axonal
regeneration (larger
caliber
axons
numbers of myelinated axons) suggesting the potential of
CA extract for accelerating repair of damaged neurons [92].
A triterpenoid-rich standardized extract of CA has
demonstrated neurite outgrowth promoting activity in
human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell line [105]. Furthermore,
CA leaves extract and its 45 isolated fractions were
evaluated for robust induction in neurite outgrowth and
neuroﬁlament expression in cultured pheochromocytoma
PC12 cells [106]. The fraction rich in asiatic acid and
madecassic acid showed maximum efﬁcacy towards nerve
differentiation in vitro, probably through activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) signaling pathway
[106]. Furthermore, asiatic acid and madecassic acid alone
and six combinations (from asiatic acid, madecassic,
madecassoside, quercetin, and isoquercetin) on 72 h of
exposure
cultured
pheochromocytoma
PC12
showed profound synergistic activation to neuroﬁlaments
(NF66, NF68 upregulation) in vitro [107].
Cultured pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line is a widely
employed model for studying neuronal differentiation in
responding to various treatments [106]. Activation of the
MAPKs is known to be an essential step in neurite
outgrowth
[108,109].
Furthermore,
neuroﬁlament
(NF68) is the most representative protein as a structural
component of the differentiated neurons [110]. NGF is one
of the key modulators for the development of neurites.
Comparison of individual triterpenoids from CA leaves,
namely madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and
asiatic acid was made for their neurite outgrowth activities
and mechanisms using immunoﬂuorescent cell staining in
neuro-2a cells [111]. Neurite outgrowth activity of the
glycosides (madecassoside and asiaticoside) was found to
involve the activation of sustained ERK phosphorylation
leading to CREB activation. At the same time, their agly-
cones (madecassic acid and asiatic acid) activated only
transient signaling of ERK1/2. The role of Akt activation
was a suggested probable mechanism of neurite outgrowth
activity of CA leaves’ triterpenoid constituents [111].
Recently, the raw extract of CA alone and in combination
with neurotrophic factors is reported to induce the prolif-
eration of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)
differentiation into Schwann cells and other neural lineage
cells [112]. These reports of neurite outgrowth promoting
activity of CA or its phytoconstituents is suggested to be
mediated through MAPKs [106] and NF68 [107], and/or
ERK phosphorylation leading to CREB activation [111]
and supported the potential of CA phytoconstituents as an
alternative to neural growth factors in the management of
neuropsychiatric diseases.
Mechanism through neuronal regeneration
For degenerative diseases, such as AD, the restoration of
lost neural tissue could be a successful treatment option
[113]. Axonal regeneration is vital for functional recovery
following nerve damage typically found in neurodegener-
ative diseases. The regeneration of axonal neurons is one of
the recent strategies for the discovery of new options in
management of AD [113]. The ethanolic extract CA
(100 mg/mL) and asiatic acid (1 mM, 0.5 mg/mL) showed
neurite elongation and acceleration of the axonal regener-
ation and promoted repair of damaged neurons of human
SH-SY5Y cells in vitro in the presence of nerve growth
factor (NGF) [92]. However, the water extract of CA was
found ineffective at the same concentration (100 mg/mL).
The difference in CA extract obtained from ethanol
extraction showed different efﬁcacy proﬁles than water
extract [88] which is attributed to the presence of asiat-
icoside in ethanolic extract of CA leaves [92]. Asiatic acid
was found orally bioavailable when given as part of a
triterpene fraction during clinical studies [114].
These results are supported by a recent study where an
ethanolic extract of CA rich in triterpene glycosides,
madecassoside,
asiaticoside
reducing the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity
and suppressing proinﬂammatory cytokine/mediators and
oxidative stress markers both in vitro (SH-SY5Y and
RAW 264.7 cells) and in vivo (PS-induced neuro-
inﬂammation in rats) [115].
Mechanism through dendritic arborization
Converging evidence indicates that processes occurring in
and around neuronal dendrites are central to the patho-
genesis of AD [116]. Dendrites play a vital role in the
function of the neuronal circuits because of the ability of
neurons integration and processing the incoming infor-
mation [117,118]. The morphology of dendrites, such as
branch
density
grouping
patterns,
highly
correlated to the function of the neuron. Dendritic
arborization, also known as neuronal branching, is known
to enhance learning and memory [119,120]. CA fresh leaf
extract, prepared without going for standard (aqueous or

ethanolic) extraction, at the dose of 2, 4, and 6 mL per
day, for 6 weeks, showed dose- and duration-dependent
signiﬁcant increase in the dendritic branching points
(a measure of dendritic arborization) and intersections
(a measure of dendritic length) of amygdaloid [88] and
hippocampal neurons [91,121] and form a basis for
learning and memory enhancement efﬁcacy of CA leaves
Efﬁcacy in animal models of learning and
CA is well known in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic
medicine for the improvement of cognitive function [122].
Therefore, many researchers have focused on the evaluation
of the efﬁcacy of neuroprotective effects of CA leavese
related compounds. These reports were well-documented
with a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of cognitive
disorders and were reviewed in the past [2,3,122,123].
Table 21.1 is presenting the existing body of research reports
of efﬁcacy of CA and its phytoconstituents against cognitive
disorders with possible mechanisms for such activities.
Efﬁcacy against epilepsy
Epilepsy, a common chronic neurological disorder char-
acterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures, is a major
health problem that affects 1e2% of the world population
[146]. Epilepsy is associated with the alterations in
psychological, emotional, and educational parameters.
Cognitive problems with abnormal behavioral manifesta-
tion are commonly encountered by a majority of epilepsy
[147].
Moreover,
improvement
suggested to help improve the quality of life in epilepsy
patients [148].
Many plant preparations, including the preparations of
CA leaves per se or as a supplement, are suggested to

the potential of CA leaves as an adjunctive medication for
epileptic patients has been reported by many authors
[148,150,151].
aqueous
(300 mg/kg, oral) was reported to cause signiﬁcant
prevention of the cognitive impairment and attenuation of
the oxidative stress markers in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)
kindled rats [150]. Furthermore, ethyl acetate fraction of
CA (EACA) is reported to give additive effects when
combined with intraperitoneally administered antiepileptic
drugs in terms of protection of mice in the PTZ test [151].
Besides,
combination
gabapentin
EACA
demonstrated a broader margin between the effective dose
and the neurotoxic dose [151], which suggests the use-
fulness of CA leaves in more effective and safer combi-
nation in epilepsy patients.
The changes in the cholinergic system by CA extract are
suggested to be one of the facets of its anticonvulsant
activity [146]. Distribution and neurophysiological role of
acetylcholine
(ACh)
enzyme
acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) in many regions of the central nervous system
during the manifestation of epilepsy is known [152].
Increased acetylcholine content and decreased acetylcho-
linesterase activity in different brain regions was reported
GABA
antagonist,
pentylenetetrazol-induced
seizures in male rats [146]. Various extracts of CA leaves
(n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) are reported to
reduce the cholinergic alterations during PTZ-induced
epilepsy [146]. Another facet of antiepileptic activity of
CA leaves extract is an increase in ATPases activity in
epilepsy [153]. In PTZ treated rats, the activities of three
ATPases namely ATP Phosphohydrolase, Naþ, Kþ -
ATPase, and Ca2þ -ATPase activity were reported to
decrease in different regions of the brain (cerebral cortex,
cerebellum, pons medulla, and hippocampus whereas pre-
treatment of CA leaves extract showed a signiﬁcant
increase in these ATPases) [153].
However, the more interesting facet of the antiepileptic
potential of CA leaves extract’s efﬁcacy extends to pos-
tictal pain and depression [154]. Most patients with epi-
lepsy (72%) reported postictal behavioral impairment
[155]. Subacute (21-days) treatment of INDCA at an oral
dose (10e100 mg/kg, once a day, 21 days) demonstrated
anticonvulsant efﬁcacy (decrease in severity and duration,
increase in onset time) against PTZ-induced kindling
seizures in rats [154]. Besides, INDCA also showed
amelioration of symptoms of postictal pain and depression
as shown in the tail-ﬂick test and OFT [154]. The brain
levels of GABA, 5-HT, Naþ, Kþ -ATPase showed a
signiﬁcant increase, which is in line with past research on
CA leaves extract against pentylenetetrazol-induced sei-
zures [153].
Efﬁcacy against neuropathy and spinal cord
Pentacyclic triterpenoids from CA are reported to be used
in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes and
diabetic complications [12]. Asiatic acid is reported to
preserve pancreatic beta-cell mass and mitigates hyper-
glycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [156].
The wound healing potential of asiaticoside in diabetic
rats is also reported [157]. Oral treatment of asiaticoside
(0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day) at a period of 5 days before and
3 weeks after sciatic nerve crush injury to streptozotocin-
induced diabetic rats was shown to reverse the enhanced

serious complication of trauma that leads to sensory and
motor dysfunction and high rates of morbidity in terms of
neurological functions [161]. Seven days of administra-
tion of asiaticoside (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day, oral) in an
animal model of spinal cord injury showed augmentation
of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores (a measure of
improved neurological function), reduction in inﬂamma-
tory markers (water content of spinal cord, the levels of
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NF-kB p65 unit,
TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6), and suppression of the expres-
sion of p38-MAPK [162].
Antiinﬂammatory and antinociceptive activities of
asiatic acid have been reported in animal models like
carrageenan-induced acute inﬂammation, acetic acid-
induced writhing, and formalin-induced pain in male
mice [163]. Asiatic acid decreased the NO, TNF-a, and
interleukin-1b (IL-1b) levels in serum and iNOS, cyclo-
oxygenase (COX-2), and NF-kB expressions in the edema
paw tissue [163]. Similarly, the madecassic acid, another
triterpenoid aglucone, isolated from CA leaves is reported
to potently suppress the inﬂammatory mediators via the
downregulation of NF-kB activation in RAW 264.7
macrophage cells [164]. Moreover, the titrated extract of
CA, which comprises 29%e30% madecassic acid, effec-
tively inhibited lipopolysaccharides-induced inﬂammatory
responses [165].
Neurodegenerative and
neuroinﬂammatory disorders
CA, especially its leaves, has a long history of traditional
use as brain or nerve tonic in the traditional literature for
neuronal health. Consequently, many researchers have
investigated and conﬁrmed the traditional neuroprotective
use on a scientiﬁc base. Efﬁcacy of CA, its extracts and
individual phytoconstituents against many oxidative stress
and proinﬂammatory cytokines [166e173] from animal
models of disease conditions in vivo or against many tox-
icants in vitro has been reported. The potential of CA on
neuroprotective effects of CA extract has been reviewed
extensively [2,174,175].
These reviews specially focused on neuroprotective
properties of CA through antioxidant mechanisms, neuro-
degenerative diseases such as PD along with cognitive
disease, AD. Therefore, the part of the chapter is focused on
the current status of the research of the efﬁcacy of CA or its
phytoconstituents
neuroinﬂammatory
where mechanisms other than antioxidant have been sug-
gested. These reports include efﬁcacy in animal models of
clinically relevant neuroinﬂammatory conditions such as
neuropathy, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, and
others. The recent developments regarding the potential of
CA extract and its phytoconstituents against PD and Hun-
tington disease (HD) are presented below.
[176e180]
phytoconstituents
namely asiaticoside [181e183], madecassoside [184], and
asiatic acid [165,185,186] are reported to have neuro-
protective potential in experimental PD in vitro and
in vivo. Drosophila melanogaster has been extensively
used as a model, based on loss of function of phosphatase
and tensin-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and pro-
vides a time- and cost-effective screening tool for poten-
tial anti-Parkinson agent discovery [187,188]. PINK1
mutants of D. melanogaster show several similarities with
PD, including dopamine neuronal degeneration and lo-
comotor defects [189,190]. The efﬁcacy of CA extract
(7 mg/100 g) as a food additive along with ﬁve of the
classical herbs is reported for the ability to improve the
climbing activity of a fruit ﬂy (D. melanogaster) PINK1
mutants, and healthy wild-type ﬂies [177]. Also, CA
leaves extract (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 mL/mL in diet, 24 days)
was shown to reverse the loss of climbing ability, activity
pattern, and oxidative stress of fruit ﬂy [178].
One of the major etiological factors implicated in PD is
a-synuclein aggregation in brain [191,192]. Therefore,
inhibition of a-synuclein aggregation has become a major
therapeutic target for potential agents against PD [193].
Aqueous extract of CA showed complete inhibition of the
a-synuclein aggregation from monomers and oligomer to
aggregates and favored the disintegration of the preformed
ﬁbrils in the aggregation kinetics study using a thioﬂavin-
T assay, circular dichroism, and transmission electron
microscopy [180].
Aqueous extract of CA is reported to protect the brain
in experimentally induced parkinsonism in animals namely
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-
induced [176]. Subacute (21-days) oral treatment of
aqueous extract of CA (300 mg/kg/day) reported to
decrease in MPTP-induced oxidative stress in corpus
striatum and hippocampus in aged rats [176]. MPTP is

known to induce selective toxicity to dopaminergic neurons
via its metabolite, MPPþ, and induces a Parkinson-like
syndrome in animals [194,195]. Treatment with asiatico-
side is reported to protect against MPTP neurotoxicity to
improve locomotor dysfunction, protect dopaminergic
neurons, reverse dopamine loss, increase the B-cell
lymphoma
(BCL2)
Regulator (Bax) ratio in the striatum of rats [181], and
reverses glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein expression in astro-
cytes, a marker of neuronal damage [182]. Similar effects
were observed during 7 days of madecassoside (30 and
60 mg/kg, oral) exposure which showed recovery from
early signs of MPTP-induced parkinsonism via reversing
the depletion of DA, antioxidant activity, increasing ratio of
Bcl-2/Bax, increasing protein expression of BDNF [184].
Asiatic acid reported in vivo neurotrophic efﬁcacy against
in MPTP/probenecid (MPTP/p)-induced neurotoxicity via
activating MAPK, PI3K-Akt-GSK3b, and mTOR signaling
pathways and [186] and in vivo against methamphetamine-
mediated neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons by inhib-
iting
NF-kB/STAT3/ERK
mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis [165].
Another animal model that is used for anti-Parkinson
agent evaluation is rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in
rats [196]. Triterpenoid-based standardized extract of CA
(10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, 20 days) showed a signiﬁcant
increase in locomotion together with many dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum (measured by
tyrosine-hydroxylase
immune-histological
staining)
rotenone-induced PD rats probably through the protection
of mitochondrial complex I activity, and the enhancement
of antioxidant enzyme expression [179]. Pretreatment with
asiatic
(10 nM)
offered
neuroprotection to the
SH-SY5Y cells from rotenone toxicity in vitro (over-
ROS,
apoptosis) [185]. Recently, novel phytoconstituents from
CA, namely asiaticoside-D, showed monoamine oxidase-
B inhibiting potential in rotenone degenerated cerebral
ganglions of an earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris [183].
offer
3-
nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)einduced mitochondrial dys-
functions, viz., reduction in the activity of SDH, electron
transport chain enzymes, and decreased mitochondrial
viability in the striatum and other brain regions in vitro
[197]. Furthermore, a standardized aqueous extract of CA
showed a prophylactic efﬁcacy against 3-NPA-induced early
oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in the
striatum and other brain regions [198] and brain of prepu-
bertal mice [199]. A fungal toxin, 3-NPA, is a well-known
neurotoxicant which induces selective striatal pathology
similar to that seen in HD [198] The various reports of the
efﬁcacy of CA against 3-NPA-induced toxicity [197e199]
suggest CA as a potential option in controlling HD-related
impairments.
Efﬁcacy against drug or chemical neurotoxicity
Oral supplementation of CA extract during the postweaning
period
provided
lead
acetateeinduced behavioral impairments and neurotoxicity,
probably through increased acetylcholinesterase enzyme
levels and antioxidant activity [200]. This report is espe-
cially important because of the speciﬁcity of the nervous
system as a primary target for lead exposure and to the
developing brain than the mature brain [201]. Furthermore,
the period from gestation through lactation period is sen-
sitive to lead exposure and has long-term consequences for
child cognitive development [202].
Recently, methanol extract of CA has been shown to
protect the mouse brain and astrocytes from oxidative
stress and inﬂammation induced by paracetamol [203].
Paracetamol is a commonly used analgesic and antipyretic
agent. However, its overdose is known to cause vital organ
toxicities, including the brain [204]. The methanol extract
of CA shows protective action against the damage
caused by paracetamol by protecting the tissue architec-
ture, increasing antioxidants, and upregulating antiin-
ﬂammatory cytokines [203].
Infusion of CA and various fractions (ethyl acetate,
n-butanol and dichloromethane) of aqueous extract of CA
was found be effective against quinolinic acid, and sodium
nitroprusside (SNP)einduced toxicity [205] Asiaticoside
was reported to be neuroprotective against N-methyl
D-aspartate
(NMDA)einduced
excitotoxicity
inhibition of decreased neuronal cell loss, restoration of
expression of apoptotic-related proteins Bcl-2 and Bax,
downregulation of NMDA receptor subtype 2B expression,
and calcium inﬂux inhibition [206].
Efﬁcacy against cerebral ischemia
Cognitive impairment and memory dysfunction following
stroke diagnosis are common symptoms that signiﬁcantly
affect the survivors’ quality of life [207]. Given that the
cerebral blood ﬂow or regulation of cerebral circulation is
attenuated in the elderly, aging-induced cognitive decline is
corelated with the condition of brain ischemia (stroke),
especially in elderly subjects [208]. Approximately 30% of
stroke patients develop dementia within 1 year of stroke
onset [209]. Several studies showed that survivors of
childhood arterial ischemic stroke have long-term cognitive
impairment [210].
Because of cognitive function enhancing properties of
CA and its phytoconstituents, their potential against cere-
bral
ischemia
(stroke)
explored
many
researchers. Subacute (21-days) oral supplementation of
ethanolic extract of CA (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/day)
showed dose-dependent protection in middle cerebral artery
occlusioneinduced ischemia and neurological deﬁcits in

rats [211]. Subacute administration of total triterpenoids-
based standardized extract of CA showed improved
cognition (improved memory and learning ﬂexibility deﬁ-
cits) and hippocampal pathology (ameliorated neuronal
damage) after short-term (24 h) and long-term (12 months)
induction period of mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by
permanent right common carotid artery occlusion in rats
[212] and transient bilateral common carotid artery occlu-
sion in mice [213]. These effects are supported by in vitro
experiments of the neurogenic effect on human neuro-
blastoma cells by standardized extract of CA [105] and
against ischemia-hypoxia in cultured rat cortex neurons by
asiaticoside [214].
Asiatic acid, an aglycone form of asiaticoside has also
reported efﬁcacy to lower infarct volume in mouse and rat
models of focal ischemia [215,216] and focal embolic stroke
[217]. In a mouse model of permanent cerebral ischemia,
pretreatment of asiatic acid (30, 75, or 165 mg/kg, oral, 1 h
pre- and 3, 10, and 20 h postischemia) signiﬁcantly reduced
the infarct volume by 60% (day 1) and 26% (day 7)
postischemia, improved neurological outcome, and suggested
to act through decreased blood-brain barrier permeability and
reduction in mitochondrial injury [215]. In the rat model of
stroke, focal cerebral ischemia, asiatic acid (75 mg/kg) treat-
ment was reported to decrease infarct volume and improve
neurological outcome, attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction,
reduce matrix metalloproteinase-9 induction, and found to
have a long therapeutic time window [216].
In addition to asiaticoside, madecassoside, another
triterpenoid glycoside from CA, demonstrated protective
effects against the focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury
in rats, an animal rat model of cerebral ischemia [218].
Madecassoside showed signiﬁcant efﬁcacy to resolve the
neurological deﬁcits, reduce brain infarct area (assessed by
2,3,5-Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining), ameliorate
neuronal apoptosis (assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining), and attenuate production of proinﬂammatory
cytokines, including p65 subunit of NF-kB (assessed by
ELISA) [218]. These results are supported by the pro-
tective effects of madecassoside against hypoxic-ischemic
injuryeinduced cellular toxicity in GT1-7 neuronal cell
lines, in vitro [219].
Recent advance: nasal delivery of CA
Recently, exploration of the intranasal route demonstrated
the interesting activity proﬁle of triterpenoid-based stan-
dardized extract of CA leaves (INDCA) as a treatment
option for neuropsychiatric conditions [220e222]. The
CNS diseases and disorders such as migraine, AD, etc.,
require the presence of the drug to the brain for the
treatment, and the nasal drug delivery system exhibited
promising results for the same [223]. The nasal route of
administration provides a practical, noninvasive method to
deliver therapeutic agents to the brain and spinal cord
bypassing the blood-brain barrier and eliminating the po-
tential side effects [224,225]. Subacute intranasal INDCA
administration (5, 15, and 50 mg, twice a day) showed
promising
efﬁcacy
CUMS-induced
anhedonia (sucrose preference test), anxiety (marble-
burying test), aggression (resident intruder test) and
cognitive decline memory (Morris water maze, Y-maze) in
rats probably through stress reduction property (normal-
izing of elevated cortisol levels) [220].
Migraine is a common debilitating condition with
severe recurrent headaches and sensitivity to light and
sound, nausea, and vomiting [226]. Nitroglycerin, an NO
donor, is the most prominent exogenous algogenic (pain-
producing)
substance
triggers
migraine-related
features in conjunction with intense pain responses [227].
Acute and subacute pretreatment of INDCA (10 and 30 mg/
kg, oral and 100 mg/rat, intranasal) showed signiﬁcant
antinociception activity, and reversal of the nitroglycerine-
induced hyperalgesia (an animal model of migraine) and
brain serotonin concentration decline [221]. Furthermore,
the effects of subacute administration of intranasal INDCA
against nitroglycerine-induced chronic pain are discussed
[222]. Subacute (21 days) coadministration of INDCA (5,
15, 50 mg, twice a day) with nitroglycerine (10 mg/kg i.p.

parameters. Intranasal INDCA demonstrated efﬁcacy in
terms of preventing pain (facial pain expressions measured
by rat grimace scale, RGS), thermal hyperalgesia (using tail
ﬂick against radiant heat), mechanical allodynia (using von-
Frey apparatus), photophobia (light dark box), and anxiety
(elevated plus-maze) parameters. The proposed mechanism
of intranasal INDCA against migraine was suggested to be
through the prevention of NTG-induced increase in cortisol
(serum and brain) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide (plasma and brain), and NO (serum). The
morphology epithelium of the nose turbinate was reported
to be unaffected by subacute intranasal INDCA adminis-
tration [222]. Thus, the intranasal delivery of INDCA is
emerging as an optimal way of supportive treatment for
neuropsychiatric disorders such as stress-related disorders,
tension-type headaches and migraine pain.

Role of big data in research

Life cycle and management of data using technologies
Approach of regulatory agencies
Big healthcare data: security and privacy
Big data[big prospects
Our entire current generation is dependent on information
technology and each one of us is bombarded with
enormous data points. Oxford dictionary deﬁnes Big
Data
as:
extremely
large
datasets
analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and
associations, especially relating to human behavior and
interactions.
In all areas of disciplines, Big Data may beneﬁt to
discover underlying nuances of varieties of phenomena,
and further facilitate decision-making.
Role of big data in research
The projected three times increase in the incidences of
dementia in the coming decades [1] will put immense
pressure on the caregivers and healthcare systems. Hence
there is a deﬁnitive push in the data analytics for devel-
oping precise predictive tools to spot early signs of
cognitive decline that may develop into full-blown de-
mentias or to slow down progression of the disease. The
identiﬁcation of biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD)
has paved the way for research into early determinants,
with an emphasis on treating patients before the clinical
manifestation of the disease [2]. According to a study of the
drug development pipeline for AD in 2017, current efforts
focus mainly on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) [3],
and most of DMT agents in phase III AD trials (as reported
on https://clinicaltrials.gov
2017)
address
targets (15 out of 18) (idem). Yet, the failure rate for these
kinds of trials is notoriously high [4].
Chip giant Intel had partnered with Michael J Fox
Foundation for Parkinson’s research and they were working
on a study that will pull patterns from data collected from
patients’ wearable devices. Motion sensors are common
today in wearables, watches, and mobile devices for
monitoring exercise or step counts. These gross measures
of movement, however, do not provide a direct measure of
Parkinson’s features such as tremor, bradykinesia, or
dyskinesia, as each of those symptoms have very distinct
features.
The striking differences between old-style health anal-
ysis and Big Data health analytics is the heavy use of cross-
platform programming in integrating various data touch
points.
Many healthcare stakeholders trust information tech-
nology because of its meaningful outcomesdtheir oper-
ating systems are functional, and they can process the data
into standardized forms. Today, the healthcare industry is
faced with the challenge of handling rapidly developing big
healthcare data. The ﬁeld of big data analytics is growing
and has the potential to provide useful insights for the
healthcare system. As noted above, most of the massive
amounts of data generated by this system is saved in hard
copies, which must then be digitized [5].
Big data can bring advancement to healthcare research
process and substantially bring down the overall cost, while
supporting advanced patient care, improving patient out-
comes, and avoiding suspected adverse events.

Big data analytics is currently used to predict the out-
comes of decisions made by physicians, for example, the
outcome of a morbid condition based on patient’s demog-
raphy and health status. Thus, we can say that the role of
big data in the research is to manage datasets related to the
outcomes and their speciﬁc risks, which are complex and
difﬁcult to manage if already not identiﬁed in the research
protocol. This also directly interprets in lowering the in-
surance cost and patient payouts in case of any serious
adverse events. In 2011, organizations working in the ﬁeld
of healthcare had produced more than 150 exabytes of data
[6], all of which must be efﬁciently analyzed to be at all
useful to the healthcare system.
An algorithm built on levels of metabolites identiﬁed in
a blood sample can precisely forecast whether a child is on
the Autism spectrum of disorder (ASD), based upon a
recent study. Instead of looking at individual metabolites,
researchers investigated patterns of several metabolites and
found signiﬁcant differences between metabolites of chil-
dren with ASD and those that are neurotypical. These
differences allowed them to categorize whether an indi-
vidual is on the Autism spectrum, by measuring 24 me-
tabolites from a blood sample, and even to some degree
where on the spectrum they land.
Big data techniques applied to biomedical data found
different patterns in metabolites relevant to two connected
cellular pathways (a series of interactions between mole-
cules that control cell function) that have been hypothe-
sized to be linked to ASD: the methionine cycle and the
transulfuration pathway. The methionine cycle is linked to
several cellular functions, including DNA methylation and
epigenetics, and the transulfuration pathway results in the
production of the antioxidant glutathione, decreasing
oxidative stress [7].
Another case study provides an interesting insight on a
unique, population-based observational research initiative
aimed at measuring and improving cardiovascular health
and the quality of ambulatory cardiovascular care provided
in Ontario, Canada, by The CArdiovascular HEalth in
Ambulatory care Research Team (CANHEART); with a
particular focus on identifying opportunities to improve the
primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events
in Ontario’s diverse multiethnic population.
A population-based cohort comprising 9.8 million
Ontario adults 20 years in 2008 was assembled by linking
multiple electronic survey, health administrative, clinical,
laboratory, drug, and electronic medical record databases
using encoded personal identiﬁers. The cohort included
z9.4 million primary prevention patients and z400,000
secondary prevention patients. Follow-up on clinical events
was achieved through record linkage to comprehensive
hospitalization, emergency department, and vital statistics
administrative databases. Proﬁles of cardiovascular health
and preventive care are being developed at the health
region level, and the cohort will be used to study the causes
of regional variation in the incidence of major cardiovas-
cular events and other important research questions.
The CANHEART research initiative will be a powerful
Big Data resource for scientiﬁc research studies aimed at
improving cardiovascular health and health service de-
livery. It represents a major Canadian effort aimed at
creating a learning health system whereby data routinely
collected from disparate parts of the health system are
brought together and analyzed to generate new insights into
how to improve patient outcomes.
Linkage of multiple databases will enable the CAN-
HEART study cohort to serve as a powerful Big Data
resource for scientiﬁc research aimed at improving car-
diovascular health and health services delivery. Study
ﬁndings will be shared with clinicians, policy makers, and
the public to facilitate population health interventions and
quality improvement initiatives [8].
Technology of big data
The architecture of Big Data must be synchronized with the
support infrastructure of the organization. To date, all of the
data used by organizations are stagnant. Data are increas-
ingly sourced from various ﬁelds that are disorganized and
messy, such as information from machines or sensors and
large sources of public and private data. Previously, most
companies were unable to either capture or store these data,
and available tools could not manage the data in a
reasonable amount of time. However, the new Big Data
technology improves performance, facilitates innovation in
the products and services of business models, and provides
decision-making support. Big Data technology aims to
minimize hardware and processing costs and to verify the
value of Big Data before committing signiﬁcant company
resources.
Professionally managed Big Data are accessible, reli-
able, secure, and controllable. Hence, Big Data uses can be
applied in multifaceted scientiﬁc disciplines (either single
or interdisciplinary), including atmospheric science, as-
tronomy, medicine, biology, genomics, and biogeochem-
istry. Below, we brieﬂy discuss data management tools and
propose a new data life cycle that uses the technologies and
terminologies of Big Data (Fig. 22.1).
With the development of computing technology, vast
volumes can be managed without the need of supercom-
puters and high cost. Most tools and methods are available
for data management, including Google BigTable, Simple
DB, Not Only SQL (NoSQL), Data Stream Management
System (DSMS), MemcacheDB, and Voldemort. However,
researchers must develop tools and technologies that can
store, access, and analyze large amounts of data in real time
because Big Data contrasts from the traditional data and
cannot be stored in a single dataset. Moreover, Big Data


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 346

lacks the architecture of traditional data. For Big Data,
some of the most widely used tools and systems are
Hadoop, MapReduce, and Big Table. These innovations
have changed the traditional approach for data management
because they effectively process large amounts of data
efﬁciently, cost-effectively, and in a timely manner [9].
Patient monitoring tools relay data to researchers
instantaneously by tracking RWE (real-world evidence)
in real time via wearable devices, sensors, and smart-
phones powered by Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Big Data, and
predictive analytics. (Source: https://www.iconplc.com/
2018_ICON_Publication_Digital_Health_Whitepaper.pdf.)
Myriad types of testing and monitoring can now be done
remotely. Wearable devices that are similar in scope and
design to commercial ﬁtness trackers as well as skin sensors
can collect data on heart rate, blood pressure, ECG (Elec-
trocardiography), skin temperature, breathing rates, and
sleep cycles (source https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/
articles/PMC6032822/ Wearable Devices in Clinical Tri-
als: Hype and Hypothesis, Izmailova, Wanger and Per-
akslis). Patients being monitored while in the comfort of
their own homes and maintaining their own routines means
that the data is providing a complete picture of the patients’
lives and not just a limited time frame within the walls of a
doctor’s ofﬁce. Some of the data collection is passive, with
no work required on the part of the patient. For other types
of testing, patients must use a mobile phone, paired with the
medical device, to send data points forward [10].
Life cycle and management of data
using technologies
Throughout each stage of the data life cycle, the manage-
ment of Big Data is the most challenging issue. This
problem was ﬁrst raised in the initiatives of UK e-Science a
decade ago. The data were geographically dispersed,
managed, and owned by several entities. The new method
to data management and treatment required in e-Science is
reﬂected in the scientiﬁc data life cycle management
(SDLM) model. In this model, present practices are
analyzed in different scientiﬁc communities. The generic
life cycle of scientiﬁc data is composed of sequential
stages, including experiment planning (research project),
data collection and processing, discussion, feedback, and
archiving.
The proposed data life cycle consists of the following
stages: collection, ﬁltering and classiﬁcation, data analysis,
storing, sharing and publishing, and data retrieval and
discovery [9].

Drug Administration (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-
voices/fdas-comprehensive-effort-advance-new-innovations-
initiatives-modernize-innovation), “Our longstanding goal
for medical care is to ensure that the right drug or device is
delivered to the right patient at the right time. This vision is
increasingly possible with the innovative products that are
becoming available.”
The FDA is implementing a more standardized, efﬁ-
cient, and comprehensive process for review of drug safety.
This new process will leverage staff expertise in data ana-
lytics to develop more standardized approaches and tem-
plates for how to evaluate safety data as part of new drug
applications. This process fully leverages the standard
datasets that must be submitted in drug applications. It also
brings in added quantitative and programming expertise in
the conduct of safety analyses to support the medical
team’s efforts. As part of this effort, the FDA is looking to
make the review process more integrated, multidisciplinary,
and problem-focused; and to develop a review document

approach. By enhancing efﬁciency and providing greater
support for the application review, they intend to “front
load” this process. This approach should result in more time
during the review cycle for key discussions, such as on
labeling and on post-market requirements and commit-
ments. These new processes should align well with FDA’s
ongoing efforts to base our regulatory decisions on an
informed
assessment
beneﬁt-risk
balancedby
providing a deeper understanding of the risks, along with a
comprehensive assessment of beneﬁt, incorporating the
patient’s perspectives and preferences.
As part of these efforts, the FDA is also actively
working to evaluate the use of real-world evidence (RWE)
to support regulatory decisions. This includes data captured
from sources such as electronic health records, registries,
and claims and billing data. Real-world evidence can help
answer questions that are relevant to broader patient pop-
ulations or treatment settings where information may not be
captured through traditional clinical trials. This is helping
the FDA to expand its ability to use RWE for post-
marketing safety surveillance and exploring its potential
to help support expanded label indications.
FDARA provided important funding to evaluate how
RWE can be generated, and its potential use in product
evaluation. The funding included signiﬁcant new resources
to enhance the FDA’s Sentinel system. To date, Sentinel
has been used to assess safety. The FDA is now supporting
the ﬁrst randomized prospective intervention trial that
makes use of information in the Sentinel system. To take

application,
IMPACT-Aﬁb trial will test an educational intervention to
address the important public health problem of underuse of
effective medications to reduce the risk of stroke in patients
with atrial ﬁbrillation. This proof-of-concept trial can serve
as a prototype for future RWE trials. At the same time, in
another proof-of-concept study, the FDA is also funding a
project to examine whether RWE that’s generated using
observational data can replicate the results of approxi-
mately 30 randomized controlled clinical trials for drugs.
Big healthcare data: security and
privacy
Big Data has fundamentally changed the way organizations
manage, analyze, and leverage data in any industry. One of
the most promising ﬁelds where Big Data can be applied to
make a change is healthcare. Big healthcare data has
considerable potential to improve patient outcomes, predict
outbreaks of epidemics, gain valuable insights, avoid pre-
ventable diseases, reduce the cost of healthcare delivery,
and improve the quality of life in general. However,
deciding on the allowable uses of data while preserving
security and patient’s right to privacy is a difﬁcult task. Big
Data, no matter how useful for the advancement of medical
science and vital to the success of all healthcare organiza-
tions, can only be used if security and privacy issues are
addressed. To ensure a secure and trustworthy Big Data
environment, it is essential to identify the limitations of
existing
solutions and envision directions for future
research.
Security and privacy in Big Data are important issues.
Privacy is often deﬁned as having the ability to protect
sensitive information about personally identiﬁable health-
care information. It focuses on the use and governance of
individual’s personal data like making policies and estab-
lishing authorization requirements to ensure that patients’
personal information are being collected, shared, and uti-
lized in the right way, while security is typically deﬁned as
the protection against unauthorized access, with some
including explicit mention of integrity and availability. It
focuses on protecting data from pernicious attacks and
stealing data for proﬁt. Although security is vital for pro-
tecting data, it is insufﬁcient for addressing privacy.
Whereas the potential opportunities offered for Big Data
in the healthcare arena are unlimited (e.g., drive health
research, knowledge discovery, clinical care, and personal
health management), there are several obstacles that impede
its true potential, including technical challenges, privacy
and security issues, and skilled talent. Big Data security and
privacy are considered huge obstacles for researchers in this
ﬁeld [11].
Big data [ big prospects
Big Data has many outcomes for patients, researchers,
providers, insurance sector, and other healthcare constitu-
ents. It will have a huge inﬂuence on how these players
engage with the healthcare environment, in particular when

external data, localization, globalization, mobility, and so-
cial networking are involved.
The swift, worldwide spread of COVID-19 in the year
2020 has brought into focus the innovative Big Data ana-
lytics tools, with individuals from all sectors of the
healthcare industry pursuing to examine and reduce the
impact of this virus.
Apple and Google have been working on a contact-
tracing tool to help identify potential cases of COVID-19.
These two tech companies have now shared more infor-
mation on the system, including sample interface design for
potential apps as well as restrictions on how it will be used.
A contact-tracing app is designed to let people know if
they have been in close contact with someone who later
reports positive for COVID-19. It could pinpoint exactly
who needs to be in quarantine and who doesn’t, making it
key to easing up social distancing measures. The purpose of
the contact-tracing app is to try and track down people and
alert them of the need to self-isolate faster than traditional
methods.
Arogya Setu, the Indian government’s mobile applica-
tion developed to track COVID-19 patients, has emerged as
a powerful tool to curb the spread of coronavirus COVID-
19 as it helped alert authorities about more than 650 hot-
spots across the country and over 300 “emerging hotspots”
which could have been missed otherwise.
Though data privacy and security are a concern, proper
handling of data as per the local regulatory guidelines and
applying appropriate legal framework would enable the
healthcare entities to utilize the enormous real-world data,
and this is always going to the big prospect for research in
the near future.

The multifactorial contributions of
Pycnogenol for cognitive function
improvement
Frank Schoenlau
Horphag Research (Europe) LTD, Limassol, Cyprus
Pycnogenol as a herbal medication
Deteriorating cognitive function in the aging brain
Mechanism of action of Pycnogenol
Pycnogenol as a cognitive enhancer
The mental process of acquiring knowledge and under-
standing complex interactions is a privilege of Homo sa-
piens and related primates. It is commonly suggested that
the brain constantly needs challenges, to continuously
develop and excel. And indeed the major stimulus to the
brain is a persistent, insatiable curiosity.
Establishing own opinion from gathered information
entertains the brain to think and critically verify compiled
information. An own interpretation of assembled data helps
establish and maintain own understanding. The routine
scrutiny and questioning of information gathered represents
an integral part of an individual’s intellectual independence.
In our times information may be gathered rapidly and be
interpreted in different ways, an invitation to establish an
own opinion and engage in discussions. Curiosity killing
cats is a myth, curiosity makes them cleverer.
Good cognitive skills meanwhile are paramount to live
an independent, exciting, and fulﬁlling life style, from early
days throughout the golden years. Muscles perhaps may no
longer carry us all that long distances any longer, but there
are technical ways to get around, to meet with friends and
relatives, to exchange thoughts, interact, and share opin-
ions. A compromised mindset, meanwhile, may prove to be
much more of a challenge. Cognitive decline typically
proceeds slowly, but may present with periods during
which the forgetfulness accelerates and gets annoying.
Habits to downplay the embarrassment with jokes, or
changing subject of the conversation, cannot be applied too
often, before it gets obvious and stale and seriously
embarrassing to everyone present. At worst, an affected
person could opt to stay all by his own, which shall be
prevented by all means.
The causes for cognitive decline are manifold. In earlier
days people commonly suffered from deteriorating cogni-
tion because of an undiagnosed and untreated hypertension.
The risk of cognitive decline attributed by untreated
hypertension poses a risk for cognitive health even nowa-
days. This relationship has recently been corroborated in an
article from the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, which emphasized the importance of regular
blood pressure control [34].
An insufﬁcient oxygen supply to the brain and high
oxidative stress are detrimental to a bright cognition.
Clinical trials have demonstrated that Pycnogenol enhances
domains of cognitive ability. In vitro and in vivo animal
and human studies have assessed its mechanisms of action,
particularly its strong anti-oxidative properties, as well as
antiinﬂammatory and vascular functions.

nutritional preparation is extracted from crushed bark, fol-
lowed by a patented extraction process [35]. A French in-
dependent regulatory and control body assesses the quality
and purity of the raw bark.
Pycnogenol is ascertained to be generally recognized as
safe. This was shown by an independent panel of toxi-
cology experts, who have classiﬁed Pycnogenol as gener-
ally safe (GRAS) based on clinical safety and preclinical
toxicology data.

phenolic
compounds,
divided
monomers (catechin, epicatechin, and taxifolin), condensed
ﬂavonoids (classed as procyanidins/proanthocyanidins),
and phenolic acids (cinnamic acids and other glycosides)
[32,50]. After being ingested, these phenolic compounds
undergo metabolization and are converted in the colon by
microbial enzymes, yielding smaller, bioavailable mole-
cules that are readily absorbable by the colon into the
bloodstream. So these phenolic compounds of Pycnogenol
can be transported to tissues and organs [46].
Pycnogenol represents the most thoroughly researched
dietary ingredient in the world to date, with more than 400
research articles published.
Pycnogenol has a long track record related to improving
blood ﬂow in arteries, veins, and the most fragile post-
capillary venules. Pycnogenol is repeatedly clinically
demonstrated, to also beneﬁt vein health and function. The

strengthening the particularly fragile postcapillary venules,
which cannot withhold the gravity force pressure and leak
ﬂuids into surrounding tissues. An affected individual may
perceive swollen legs or the circumstance that shoes are too
tight to wear.
Pycnogenol has also a long track record for alleviating
common health ailments, predominantly of circulatory- and
antiinﬂammatory nature.
Because Pycnogenol stimulates endothelium-derived ni-
tric oxide synthase, an optimal release of nitric oxide into the
blood stream sets in, which causes pronounced relaxation of
constricted vascular smooth muscle, and arteries hence dilate
expanding the diameter of the vessel. The resulting
improved endothelial function further contributes to health-
ier blood pressure and greater perfusion of tissues, with more
oxygen and nutrient-rich arterial blood delivered [35].
The elevated arterial dilatation which Pycnogenol sup-
ports by increasing nitric oxide availability, and in result,
also contributes to a healthier blood pressure. The blood
platelets likewise respond to greater presence of nitric oxide
in the blood stream, by lowering the platelet alertness for
clotting,
hence

developing
thrombosis.
Pycnogenol metabolites furthermore exert pronounced
antiinﬂammatory activity, which is attributed to Pycnogenol
metabolites potently inhibiting inﬂammation master switch
NF-kB. Inﬂammatory processes in the vicinity of neuronal
tissue are particularly harmful to cognition. Human phar-
macologic studies have revealed that Pycnogenol metabo-
lites prevent the activation of the inﬂammation “master
switch” NF-kB, in healthy student volunteers [15,16].
Tissue strengthening was further found to be attributed
to Pycnogenol inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase enzymes
(MMP1, MMP2, and MMP9), thus effectively arresting
progression of vein edema to chronic venous insufﬁciency.
Pycnogenol is extensively clinically researched for chronic
venous insufﬁciency and related venous disorders [17].
Based on the circulatory and antiinﬂammatory modes of
action there exist manifold positive activities on various
health issues, as demonstrated in the cited studies below:
Pycnogenol is used for manifold herbal applications
because of its multiple health beneﬁts. Pycnogenol has
extensively been studied and has shown to have promising
clinical effects in improving conditions including diabetes
[25,26,43],
[14,24,49];
asthma
[18,38], osteoarthritis [Belcaro et al., 2008a, b], sexual
disorders [1,22,44], and venous insufﬁciency [8,17,32].
Pycnogenol also prevents oxidative stress and side effects
in patients with hypothyroidism during levothyroxine
treatment [5] and prevents thrombosis [6].
The positive activities of Pycnogenol were specially
found for neurological disorders including attention-deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder [10,13,47] and cognitive impairment
[28].
Deteriorating cognitive function in the
aging brain
The aging brain over time is cumulatively and in acceler-
ated intensity impacted by oxidative stress. With time, brain
atrophy sets in, which further affects neuronal performance
and contributes to increasing oxidative stress to the brain.
In turn, oxidative stress may further intensify cognitive
decline, which accelerates radical burden to neuronal tis-
sues. A brain mass shrinkage sets in at the age of 60e70
years of age.
With onset of atrophy, continuous loss of tissues, such
as in the brain, muscles, and essentially body-wide, repre-
sents a natural part of the aging processes. There exists no
treatment or cure for cerebral atrophy because lost neuronal
tissues are not replaced. Brain atrophy involves more than
loss of neuronal tissue in the brain, but also the loss of
interconnections between neurons [20].
Particularly the apolipoprotein E is assigned to have
strong and manifold impacts on cognition. The apolipo-
protein E is a proteinaceous lipid carrier, involved in the
distribution and metabolization of lipids in the body and

especially in neuronal tissues. Apolipoprotein E is partic-
ularly involved in the transportation and metabolism of fats
in the body and particularly the brain. Moreover, apolipo-
protein E is implicated in Alzheimer disease [37,45].
Furthermore, the oxidation of apolipoprotein A-I in terms
of neurodegeneration is well described by Keeney et al[21].
Reactive oxygen species were considered to be poten-
tially toxic byproducts of aerobic metabolism, which, if not
eliminated, may inﬂict structural damage on various
macromolecules, such as, for example, apolipoprotein E.
Accrual of such damage over time was postulated to be
responsible for the physiological deterioration in the post-
reproductive phase of life and eventually the demise of the
organism [42].
Due to these mechanisms of aging and hallmarks of
neurodegenerative diseases, it may be beneﬁcial for senior
individuals to consume dietary interventions with antioxi-
dant properties to maintain good cognitive function and
reduce the risk of increased oxidative stress [41].
Polyphenols likewise resemble important dietary con-
stituents for spurring cognitive function. Studies found that
low urinary polyphenols are associated with cognitive
decline in an older population, investigated over a 3-year
follow-up period [33].
Not all polyphenols are created equal though. From
hundreds
monomeric

species
glycosides, an even much greater number of condensed
polyphenols are generated in plants [9]. The most exten-
sively clinically researched dietary polyphenol is Pycno-
genol, the standardized extract from French maritime pine
bark (Horphag Research), manufactured in strict accor-
dance to United States Pharmacopeia deﬁnitions [USP]. In
light of this assessment, the antioxidant mechanisms of
Pycnogenol are further discussed in the section below.
Mechanism of action of Pycnogenol
Pycnogenol French maritime pine bark extract bears pro-
cyanidins, which subsequent to oral consumption are
metabolized by omnipresent gut microbiota to bioactive
metabolites. It is commonly questioned how Pycnogenol
may display such far reaching virtues to the consumer.
Pycnogenol represents a textbook example on the
fruitful interactions between gut microbiota and plant
polyphenols [15,16]. In the small intestine microbiota

latter metabolite distributes in tissues via the insulin-
independent glucose transporter GLUT1 [30]. In conse-
quence, Pycnogenol metabolites accumulate in all tissues
expressing GLUT1 transporters: erythrocytes, leukocytes,
endothelium, and all cells of neuronal lineage [23,30,31].

pycnogenol metabolites passing the blood-brain barrier,
which in turn facilitates antioxidant protection to the brain
and all neuronal lineage. Pharmacokinetic explorations in
healthy student volunteers showed daily Pycnogenol sup-
plementation manifests in a steady state level of Pycnoge-
nol metabolites [15,16]. Metabolites entering endothelium
via GLUT1 in turn improve endothelial function, allowing
for enhanced nitric oxide generation and more pronounced
vasodilatation, and in consequence an optimal brain tissue
perfusion, with more oxygenated blood contributing to
better cognitive performance. Refer to Fig. 23.1.
In a clinical setting daily supplementation with Pycno-
genol was demonstrated in healthy subjects to signiﬁcantly
increase blood antioxidant capacity (ORAC), measured
after 3 and 6 weeks of daily supplementation. Discontinu-
ation of daily Pycnogenol supplementation led to a
progressive loss of antioxidant protection, which ﬁnally
fainted within 4 weeks of after Pycnogenol intake [11].
Another group conﬁrmed the increased blood plasma
antioxidant capacity with Pycnogenol, in a double-blind,
placebo-controlled protocol, applying the FRAP test for
monitoring.

whereas

of Pycnogenol enables to donate vast numbers of electrons
without retaining free radicals [12].
Another group veriﬁed Pycnogenol’s antioxidant vir-
tues in subjects presenting with elevated oxidative stress,
attributed to cigarette smoking. Daily supplementation with
50 mg Pycnogenol signiﬁcantly reduced plasma oxidative
stress [7].
Pycnogenol antioxidant activity also protects neurons
from oxidative harm, and therefore it can be applied as a
cognitive enhancer.
Pycnogenol as a cognitive enhancer
A most recently published peer-reviewed scientiﬁc article
assessed in detail the mechanisms of action involved with
Pycnogenol enhancing cognitive performance. The article,
published in 2019 in prominent Frontiers in Pharmacology,
by Tamara Simpson PhD and coworkers, at Swinburne
University Melbourne, Australia, assessed in detail the
efﬁcacy and mechanisms of action related to Pycnogenol
for cognitive enhancement [40].
To date the following clinical studies univocally support
the notion that Pycnogenol elevates cognitive performance
in people at all ages.
The multifactorial contributions of Pycnogenol for cognitive function improvement Chapter | 23

## Page 353

Oxidative stress is known since decades to impact
cognitive function. Earliest preclinical studies pointed to
cognitive function improvements with Pycnogenol [35].
Interestingly, Pycnogenol was shown already in early years
to help children focus better at school. Particularly children
who suffered with attention deﬁcit challenges were found
to particularly well beneﬁt from Pycnogenol supplementa-
tion, with greater attention. Veriﬁcation was carried out by
interrupting supplementation with Pycnogenol, which led
to considerable worsening of children’s attention. The
continuation of supplementing children with pycnogenol
correspondingly led again to an improvement of children’s
attention. This study in Japan conﬁrmed improvement of
children’s attention with Pycnogenol [29], while discon-
tinuation of Pycnogenol supplementation led to worsening
of symptoms; yet readministration of Pycnogenol was
shown to improve attention again.
A most recently published, peer-reviewed scientiﬁc
article investigated 87 healthy men, aged 55e75 years, who
presented with minimal cognitive dysfunction challenges.
These men were assigned to either daily supplementation
with Pycnogenol, or the control group, over an observa-
tional period of 8 weeks. Daily supplementation with
Pycnogenol proved to contribute signiﬁcantly to improved
cognitive function, by an average 18%, whereas the control
group meanwhile presented with a cognitive function
improvement by meager 2.5% on average [19].
Belcaro showed in a study with 60 healthy professionals
aged 35e55 a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of Pycnogenol on
cognitive function. The 60 subjects were distributed to one
of two groups, one control group and one Pycnogenol-
treated group. After 12 weeks the Pycnogenol group
showed a reduction of the oxidative stress levels by more
than 30% and a signiﬁcant improvement of cognitive
function [3].
Another clinical cognitive function test, The COFU3
study, explored cognitive function beneﬁts of Pycnogenol
in individuals of advanced age (55e70 years), who also
presented with elevated oxidative stress. Study participants
were followed-up over an extended period of 1 year. The
outcome presented with signiﬁcant cognition improvement
with Pycnogenol supplementation, whereas the control
group did not present with any signiﬁcant variations. The
COFU3 study, published in 2015, showed that regular,
continuous supplementation with Pycnogenol signiﬁcantly

experienced insigniﬁcant alterations to their cognitive per-

double-blinded,
study,
healthy senior citizens (aged 60e85 years) as subjects,
identiﬁed a statistical signiﬁcant cognition improvement
after 3 months of continuous daily supplementation with
Pycnogenol. The cognition improvement with Pycnogenol
coincided with signiﬁcant reduction of oxidative stress
levels, assessed as F2-isoprostanes. The placebo control
group, presenting with comparative baseline cognitive
scores, appreciated a cognition performance improvement
by a meagre and statistically insigniﬁcant 1.2%, whereas
the Pycnogenol group presented with signiﬁcant 8.3%
improvement. The oxidative stress level in the Pycnogenol
group was reduced by 22.9%, whereas the placebo group
presented with a reduction by insigniﬁcant 3.7%. Pycno-
genol thus is demonstrated to improve memory in healthy,
elderly citizens [36].
Moreover, Pycnogenol is demonstrated in another
clinical study to signiﬁcantly improve cognitive function in
healthy Students in their twenties. Student participants who
supplemented with Pycnogenol for 8 weeks scored signif-
icantly better in all six cognition tests, comprising auditory
serial addition test, a picture-recall test, mental ﬂexibility
test, the “stocking of Cambridge” test, and pattern recog-
nition.
Student
who
supplemented
Pycnogenol readily outperformed the control group. This
study with healthy students supports the understanding, that
Pycnogenol beneﬁts everybody’s cognitive health, irre-
spective of age, lifestyle, or health situation [27].
Neuronal cells have a vastly different physiology as
compared to most other body tissues. The most striking
speciality is the circumstance that cells of neuronal lineage
depend on glucose as energy source, as they cannot utilize
lipids as energy source, as most other tissues readily do.
Neurons meanwhile also require vast amounts of oxygen to
secure the brain’s high energy demand. Pycnogenol supports
better endothelial function by elevating nitric oxide release,
which in turn secures greater oxygen and nutrient supplies to
performing neurons. The ability of Pycnogenol metabolites
to reach into neuronal cells via the GLUT1 transporter
(Fig. 23.1), where they extinguish oxidative stress in
neurons, explains the tremendous cognition improvements
witnessed in clinical trials carried out to date [23].
Therefore neuronal cells receive a privileged, insulin-
independent, access to blood glucose reserves via the
GLUT1 transporter. Once glucose reserves are exhausted,
the ability to concentrate drops quickly, along with the
perception of being tired, accompanied by an appetite for
something sweet.
Because neurons cannot utilize other energy sources
than glucose, cells of neuronal lineage have a privileged
access to glucose. Glucose transporters, such as GLUT1,
channel the valuable blood glucose exclusively to the
needful, performing neuronal cells. Tissues other than
neurons utilize predominantly lipids.
The Pycnogenol metabolites, meanwhile, travel in the
body in exactly the same transporters as the glucose to
active neurons. In consequence, Pycnogenol (metabolites)
reaches the blood-brain barrier. In turn, engaged neurons
are saved from oxidative harm because Pycnogenol, as
nature’s most potent antioxidant, extinguishes radicals
swiftly.
Engaged neurons depend on continuous, uninterrupted
supply streams of oxygen, glucose, and antioxidants.
Prolonged intense concentration eventually leads to supply
gaps, which is perceived as exhaustion, with difﬁculty to
maintain continued concentration, caused by rising oxida-
tive stress, to which neurons are particularly sensitive,
because neuronal cell lineage is void of an inherent
antioxidant defense. Oxidative stress is furthermore detri-
mental to artery function, which in response constrict,
hence limiting the nutrient- and oxygen-supply streams to
the needful performant neurons. Pycnogenol is capacitated
to enhance cognition because it elevates nitric oxide
generation [48], which dilates constricted arteries, and

streams to performing neurons.
A further double-blinded study (ARCLI) is currently
ongoing in Australia, which employs neuroimaging and
investigates gut microbiota inﬂuence further to cognitive
performance enhancement [39]].
Pycnogenol may well represent a mainstay cognitive
enhancer for everybody who wishes to animate the gray
matter: clearer thinking and faster and more successful
retrieval of memories. A multitude of studies from across
the world point to signiﬁcantly better cognition with
Pycnogenol.

Advancements in delivery of herbal

Regulatory challenges
The recent rise in prevalence of neurological conditions is
alarming [1,2]as these conditions now contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to the global disease burden. According to a study
in the Lancet Neurology, neurological disorders are the
leading cause of disability-adjusted life years and the
second leading cause of death [3]. Although the cases of
infectious neurological conditions like tetanus, meningi-
tis, and encephalitis have reduced very signiﬁcantly, the
occurrence of degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer
(AD), Parkinson, motor neuron diseases, and CNS cancer,
have risen. Several reports about the prevalence and
epidemiology of these degenerative disorders show that
diseases like AD, other dementia, and Parkinson are
higher in older age groups. Thus, it is evident that though
neurological diseases caused by microbial infections have
become increasingly curable, the age-related diseases that
are growing due to increasing life expectancy continue to
pose a challenge to the scientiﬁc community.
In the early days of pharmaceutical research, the focus
was on the treatment of infectious diseases as they were a
major cause of death. However, with time, advancements
in technology brought about major socioeconomic and
cultural changes. This has led to a remarkable change in
our lifestyle, which in turn has resulted in newer diseases.
Therefore, the focus of research shifted to treatment of
lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, metabolic
syndrome, etc. Further, with increased life expectancy,
there is again a shift in the disease pattern to diseases that
only emerge beyond a certain age. These age-related
degenerative conditions have never been studied as the
number of people living beyond 80 years, which is the
target age group of sufferers, was never quite as large. It is
only now that research efforts are closing the gap to
understanding the pathology behind these disorders.
The scientiﬁc community is still trying to ﬁnd the exact
causes for these age-related pathological changes and
connecting them to environmental and societal factors.
Meanwhile these diseases are being treated symptomati-
cally or with limited knowledge about the origins and
progression of the condition.
AD is one such neurological condition, more common
in elderly patients, with the risk increasing every year past

the age of 60. The pathology of this disease is not clearly
understood and therefore available treatment options are
not effective [3,4]. There are currently only four approved
drugs for the treatment of ADddonepezil, rivastigmine,
memantine, and galantamine. However, none of these
drugs has been found to signiﬁcantly improve the life or life
span of AD patients [4].
Nature has always been a trusted resource for the dis-
covery of new drugs for mankind. Many scientists have
turned to studying natural therapies for the treatment of these
less understood diseases [5,6]. Several reviews are published
on the importance of natural agents as the potential mole-
cules in the treatment of many diseases including neuro-
logical disorders [7,8]. Many published studies explain the
role of these agents in the treatment of diseases convinc-
ingly. However, as in the case of synthetic drugs, the clinical
success rate of these herbal drugs is limited. The variability
in success rates depends not only on biological effects of the
molecules but also on several factors related to physico-
chemical properties of molecule, route, and mode/method of
delivery. Application of drug delivery science may therefore
help to convert molecules with limited utility (due to their
poor physicochemical properties) into agents of choice in
the treatment of many diseases.
Researchers are now working on developing effective
drug delivery systems for many herbal drugs. In the pre-
sent chapter we are using AD as the model neurological
disorder because of its high prevalence, and we shall
discuss the different delivery systems that can help turn
herbal drugs into potentially useful agents for the clinical
treatment of AD.
Herbal drugs in neurological health
Certain herbal drugs have become a treatment of choice due
to their efﬁcacy in a particular disease. For instance, in
dengue, papaya extract capsules are the only available
treatment option. In chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis,
curcumin gel is frequently prescribed for the treatment of
mouth ulcers; Shankhpushpi and Brahmi are well-known
nerve tonics; citrus bioﬂavonoids are the only known
treatment for hemorrhoids. Several other herbal treatment
options are available and widely used for purposes such as
controlling
sugar,
reversing
aging,
correcting
metabolism, and managing weight. Further, patient accep-
tance for herbal products is greater than that for synthetic
products. Since most herbs and herbal products have
traditional use, their safety proﬁle is reasonably established.
Therefore, herbal drugs can be launched faster than
synthetic drugs.
In folklore, several plants have the status of treatment
options
managing
neurological/nerve
health.
Now
systematic scientiﬁc studies validating the efﬁcacy of these
plants’ extracts/single constituents as the agents for the
prevention and treatment of neurological diseases have been
reported. Since this chapter is focused on the delivery of
herbal drugs for cognitive disorders in general and AD in
particular, Table 24.1 enlists all those plant extracts/single
constituents that have displayed promising ability as a treat-
ment option for AD in various in vitro and in vivo models.
Factors limiting brain delivery of herbal
The information given in Table 24.1 highlights the fact that
although many of the herbal drugs have been studied for
the treatment of AD in various in vitro and in vivo studies
performed in animal models, their utility as a drug product
is limited due to the three factors listed in Table 24.2.
Firstly, most of these molecules are highly lipophilic,
which limits their aqueous solubility. Due to an overall low
dissolution of the drug product in the gastrointestinal
region, the bioavailability is reduced. Curcumin is the
leading example of this phenomenon.
Secondly, many of these molecules degrade rapidly
not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also after
absorption into the systemic circulation. These molecules
are prone to phase I and phase II metabolic reactions in
the liver. As a result of extensive metabolism, the drug
does not reach therapeutic concentration in the body.
Rosmarinic acid, ginkgolides, resveratrol, ECG, and
chrysin are the examples of drugs that undergo rapid
ﬁrst-pass metabolism.
Thirdly, not all drugs can penetrate blood-brain barrier
(BBB), an important neuroprotective barrier in the body
designed to protect the central nervous system (CNS). This
prevents all the large molecules and many of the small
molecules from reaching the CNS. Since AD affects CNS
tissue, a molecule must cross BBB for efﬁcacy.
Though some of the factors that limit molecules as
potential drug candidates are easy to address, for instance,
poor solubility or metabolic instability, the complexity of
developing herbal drug delivery systems for neurological
diseases lies mainly in developing systems that enable
drugs to cross the BBB and reach the CNS tissue. This
limitation affects most potential agents, for example, herbal
drugs like curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, etc., demonstrate
great potential in the treatment of brain diseases in various
in vitro and in vivo studies, but failed during clinical trials
because of the poor brain delivery.
The literature is full of established techniques for
improving solubility of a molecule. Some techniques for
protecting the drug from the metabolism have also been
reported such as nanotechnology or use of alternate route of
administration. Reported techniques to improve molecular
transport across the BBB include use of various active
transport mechanisms, nanotechnology, inhibition of efﬂux

Use of excipients that facilitate permeation of a molecule across
the biological membrane such as BBB or inhibit metabolism is
a useful strategy to deliver drugs to the brain. Essential oil of
turmeric when administered with curcuminoids (Biocurcumax)
has been reported to improve bioavailability of curcumin
signiﬁcantly through oral route in human volunteers [74,75].
The studies were done using 2 g dose of curcumin in all the
three different groups (control curcumin; essential oil-curcumin;
curcumin-lecithin-piperine). For the control curcumin group,
Cmax was reported at 2 h (149.8 ng/g) and curcumin
remained in the blood up to 4.5 h. The absorption of
curcumin was faster from Biocurcumaxformulation. The
mean blood level in the ﬁrst hour was 315.8 ng/g and at
2 h
274.6 ng/g.
Cmax
obtained
4.5 h
(456.88 ng/g). Thereafter the values gradually decreased,
and curcumin was detected in the blood up to 8 h. The
improvement in bioavailability of curcumin was about 7
times than that of pure curcumin and about 6 times as
compared to curcumin-lecithin-piperine complex. The
reasons
bioavailability
Bio-
curcumax could be extraintestinal absorption of curcumin
considering the quick absorption in the ﬁrst hour.
Simultaneously other mechanisms like modulation of
phase II enzymes and P-glycoprotein, role of the non-
curcuminoid components (Ar-turmerone) in the absorp-
tion of curcumin were hypothesized for this synergistic
activity. Similar synergy in the memory enhancement
activity for combination of extracts of Panax ginseng
(ginsenosides), Ginkgo biloba (ﬂavone-glycosides), and
Crocus sativus (crocins) (collectively called as Sailuo-
tong) have also been reported [76,77]. Fish oil has also
found to improve the inhibition of cerebral Ab deposits in
the case of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) [78].
Some herbal agents are well-known metabolic enzyme
inhibitors. When herbal drugs that are highly prone to
degradation
coadministered
inhibitors, the bioavailability of these herbal drugs is
enhanced due to reduced metabolic degradation. Piperine is
one such inhibitor of hepatic phase II enzymes. Curcumin C3
complex which contains demethoxy curcumin and bisde-
methoxy curcumin is poorly bioavailable and inefﬁcacious in
AD [79], but upon addition of piperine, a dramatic rise in the
serum curcumin levels was detected. A study on humans
reported a 2000% improvement in the bioavailability of
curcumin [80]. Similar effect on the bioavailability of
rosmarinic acid [81]and resveratrol [82] is also reported
through the use of piperine.
Natural borneol is believed to possess the ability to
modify the permeability of BBB, and thereby, facilitate
entry of other drugs into the brain with brain protective
effects. In a study the borneol increased CNS penetration of
Ginkgolide when injected by iv route to mice at a dose of
6.5 mg/kg [83]. Similar strategies can also be explored
while designing drug delivery systems for the other herbal
drugs to enhance their CNS delivery.
Solid polymeric nanoparticles
Nanoparticles can improve solubility and enhance the
permeability of any drug molecule due to their size. Upon
conjugation with suitable entities even targeting can be
achieved at the site of action. Several researchers have
found that converting herbal drugs into nanoparticles results
in improved CNS delivery. Ghosh et al. reported signiﬁcant
improvement in the activity of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
(PLGA) nanoparticles of quercetin in comparison to quer-
cetin alone in the arsenic-induced liver and brain damage in
rats [84]. Conversion to nanoform must therefore not only
improve solubility and permeability but also protect the
drug from the metabolism after oral administration. Bagad
and Khan reported enhanced oral bioavailability and brain
delivery of poly(n-butylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles of
quercetin [85]. They also reported that activity is further
enhanced by coating the nanoparticles with Polysorbate-80.
Signiﬁcant improvements in the pharmacokinetic parame-
ters of quercetin in blood and brain were observed for both
polysorbate-80 coated and uncoated particles as compared
to plain quercetin. It was found that the nanoparticle

approach imparted stability to the quercetin by protecting
from metabolism and coating of nanoparticles with poly-
sorbate-80-facilitated penetration through the BBB.
Similar results are reported by Mullik et al. by preparing
curcumin nanoparticles using poly(n-butylcyanoacrylate)
[86]. These nanoparticles were coated with apolipoprotein
E3 which exhibited synergistic action with curcumin and
also prevented photodegradation of curcumin. The disrup-
tion of the BBB with the help of the nanoparticle approach
was demonstrated by Cano et al. in studies with PEGylated
PLGA nanoparticles loaded with EGCG both in vitro and
in vivo [87]. The stability of the product and bio-
distribution to the brain was found to be signiﬁcantly bet-
ter with this approach.
Among the various approaches of enhancing BBB
permeability of drugs is the use of peptides that bind to the
transferrin receptor, a carrier-mediated transport system
present in the BBB. Huang et al. conjugated curcumin-
poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with
brain targeting peptide CRT (cyclic CRTIGPSVC pep-
tide), an iron-mimic peptide that targets transferrin
receptor (TfR) to increase the penetration through the
BBB [88]. The studies were conducted in AD mice and
the conjugated nanoparticles were found to affect all the
biomarkers of AD including, levels of Ab, ROS, TNF-a,
and IL-6; the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD); and
synapse numbers. The results of Y-maze and new object
recognition tests also demonstrated the efﬁcacy of PLGA
nanoparticles
improving
memory and recognition in mice. This study suggested the
use of nanoparticles and the facilitating agents in the brain
delivery of herbal drugs.
Lipid-mediated carrier systems
Lipids owing to their lipophilic nature cross all the bio-
logical membranes easily. Since the BBB is extremely
lipophilic, these lipids can gain easy access through it.
Many researchers have used approaches that leverage the
lipophilicity of the BBB to improve the brain delivery of
herbal drugs though lipid-mediated carrier systems. The
lipid-based drug delivery systems consist of solid lipid
nanoparticles, liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, etc.
These delivery systems can be administered by oral, sub-
lingual, buccal, nasal, or parenteral route of administration.
Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are one of the
commonly studied strategies for improving bioavailability.
Dhawan et al. prepared SLNs of quercetin using compritol
888 ATO [89]. These SLNs were coated with tween 80.
The lyophilized dispersions were administered to rats in the
dose of 4.41 mg/kg by iv route. SLN of quercetin showed
excellent neuroprotective activity in aluminum chloridee
induced toxicity model in rats. The study proved that the
quercetin in the SLN form improves permeability across the
BBB; however, the effect of tween 80 was not noted.
Most of the studies to improve the brain delivery of
herbal drugs are mainly reported in animals. Very few
studies have published the use of advanced drug delivery
strategies in humans. Curcumin is a molecule of interest
to several researchers, and there are some available
reports of human clinical studies for this molecule. Sally
et al. prepared SLN of curcumin using a mixture of
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and deoxycholate (DOC), using
a hot homogenization method [90]. Ascorbic acid was
also used in this formulation to protect the curcumin from
oxidation. The pharmacokinetic proﬁle of this product in
healthy human volunteers after oral administration of
650 mg of SLN formulation showed blood levels of about
22.43 ng/mL (Cmax) at 2.40 h (tmax), while the same
dose of plain curcuminoids was not detected in the blood.
This proves the ability of SLNs in improving the
bioavailability of hydrophobic molecules [91]. Similar
results were previously reported in animals also con-
ﬁrming that SLNs of curcumin crosses BBB following
oral administration.
Cox et al. published a clinical study of curcumin SLNs
in healthy elderly humans between the age group of
60e85 years. The trial was placebo-controlled and the
dose was 400 mg Longvida capsule, which contains
80 mg of curcumin to ﬁnd acute, chronic, and acute on
chronic effect of curcumin. The results of the studies
concluded that approximately 80 mg of curcumin has the
potential to improve important cognitive functions, reduce
fatigue, and improve mood by reducing stress. This
improvement may be attributed to the effect of curcumin
on monoaminergic neurotransmission as a higher amount
of free curcumin was available after oral administration in
the CNS due to improved bioavailability [92]. Thus SLNs
could be a very useful strategy in improving the brain
delivery of herbal drugs. The use of other surfactants such
as lecithin, deoxycholate, taurocholate, tween 80, and
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil (Cremaphor)
with equivalent activity was also suggested by this study.
Vedagiri and Thangarajan reported improved bioavail-
ability and greater efﬁcacy of chrysin-loaded SLNs against
Ab25e35-induced oxidative stress [93]. SLNs were pre-
pared using stearic acid, lecithin, and taurocholate by hot
high-pressure homogenization technique. The efﬁcacy was
determined in AD rats after oral doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg.
Chrysin loaded SLNs effectively restored all the changes
induced by Ab25e35 injection indicating the progression of
AD. Free chrysin also exhibited similar efﬁcacy but at a
very high dose (50 and 100 mg/kg). Thus SLNs can
increase the potency of the herbal drugs.
Liposomes are another lipid-based delivery system that
have phospholipid bilayer structure, and the drug molecule
is entrapped inside. Liposomes exhibit improved BBB

permeability and protect encapsulated drugs from the
metabolic enzymes. Being lipids these are biocompatible,
biodegradable, and less toxic. Liposomes are also used for
targeted drug delivery. Because of these advantages,
liposomes are frequently explored for nasal delivery along
with the oral route. The nasal route like the sublingual and
buccal route is advantageous, as the ﬁrst-pass metabolism is
avoided and drug directly reaches the systemic circulation.
The use of nasal pathway is reported with a certain degree
of success for herbal drugs. Through this pathway, mole-
cules can be directly delivered to the brain through tri-
geminal or olfactory pathways. In the olfactory mucosa,
olfactory neurons are directly exposed and offer a potential
pathway for transporting drugs directly to the olfactory bulb
and brain. Thus, through this route, BBB can be bypassed
and molecules can be directly delivered into the brain.
Wattanatho et al. demonstrated improved CNS avail-
ability of quercetin when administered in liposome form
through nasal route. Liposomes were prepared using egg
phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol using the thin-ﬁlm
formation method [94]. The liposomes with an average
particle size of 200 nm were obtained. The in vivo studies
in rats at the dose of 0.06 mg/kg of body weight once daily
4 weeks
exhibited
anxiolytic
cognition-enhancing effect. Since the effect was produced
at a very low dose, it was attributed to both liposomes and
nasal delivery. Liposomes increase the permeability of the
drug through the nasal epithelium, and after absorption the
drug gets direct entry into the brain through olfactory
pathway and bypasses the BBB. The transportation of
quercetin liposomes was suggested to be through the ce-
rebrospinal ﬂuid. In another study, Priprem et al. compared
the oral and nasal administration of the quercetin-loaded
liposomes in rats for 28 days at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg [95].
The comparison was also made with quercetin suspension
by the oral route. The anxiolytic and cognitive enhance-
ment effects of oral quercetin (dose: 300 mg/kg) and
intranasal quercetin liposomes (0.5 mg/kg) were compa-
rable. Quercetin liposomes through oral route (dose:
0.5 mg/kg) didn’t show any signiﬁcant activity. At such a
low dose, even if the complete permeation to plasma
occurs then also due to metabolism and BBB, the drug
can’t reach the brain in therapeutic levels to exert any
effect. Thus the rapid delivery of quercetin to the brain is
achieved through the nasal administration of liposomes.
No clinical trials are reported for this formulation to know
the effects on humans.
In another similar study, proliposomes of Ginkgo biloba
extract were also found to be delivered to the brain in
signiﬁcantly high levels than the G. biloba extract after oral
administration in rats. The plasma and tissue levels for all
the seven constituents of G. biloba extract were measured
in this study [96].
Rajput and Butani attempted targeted brain delivery
using nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) through the intra-
nasal administration of resveratrol in rats (dose: 2 mg/kg)
[97]. To impart mucoadhesive characteristics to the NLC,
the gelling agent was added which increased residence time
at nasal mucosa. The NLC was prepared using the melt
emulsiﬁcation-ultrasonication method. Cetyl palmitate and
capmul MCM were selected as lipid carriers. Tween 80 and
poloxamer 188 were used as stabilizers/surfactants. The
particle size of optimized NLC was found to be less than
140 nm. The nasal administration of resveratrol-loaded NLC
was compared with oral administration of drug suspension.
The drug concentration was estimated in plasma and brain
tissue samples. Studies clearly showed that the levels of
resveratrol were almost 2.5 times more upon nasal admin-
istration of NLC-based gel than oral administration of
suspension. Thus, it was proved that delivery to the brain is
better through nasal administration as compared to oral
administration. Further, since plasma levels of NLC-based
gel were lesser than oral suspension, other pathways of
brain delivery other than BBB permeation were hypothe-
sized. The higher brain levels were also attributed to the
NLC.
NLC-encapsulated
resveratrol was not readily available for metabolism by
glucuronidation or sulfation as compared to resveratrol
suspension. Lower Tmax was observed in the brain of
animals administered with the developed in-situ gel, indi-
cated faster resveratrol delivery to the brain after nasal
administration and also supports the drug absorption via
olfactory lobe. Moreover, tween 80 mimics the natural LDL
receptors and improved uptake of NLC through BBB
endothelial cells. The nontoxicity at nasal epithelium and
stability of this formulation were also reported.
Sometimes, simply coadministering herbal drug with
lipids may improve the bioavailability drastically. For
instance, signiﬁcant enhancement in the bioavailability of
cannabinoids has been found when coadministered with
sesame oil or dietary lipids [98].
Miscellaneous nanocarriers
Screening of literature reveals multiple techniques that are
being used to enhance the brain delivery of herbal drugs for
the treatment of cognitive disorders. Ye et al. developed
G. biloba ﬂavonoid-loaded niosomal delivery system for
oral delivery [99]. Niosome suspension was prepared using
surfactants and cholesterol and further dried using freeze-
drying and spray-drying methods. This prevents drug
degradation, fusion, and leakage. The release of ﬂavonoid
glycosides from the niosomes was prolonged for up to 48 h.
During in vivo studies, signiﬁcantly improved distribution
to the brain was reported along with heart, lung, kidney,
and blood compared with tablets. The improved brain
delivery was due to facilitated transport of ﬂavonoid

glycosides to the brain and avoiding of phagocytosis by the
endothelial system in the liver.
Lungare et al. reported enhanced delivery of both
chrysin and curcumin to the brain using mesoporous silica
nanoparticles (MSNP) loaded with these drugs [100]. In
this study, MSNP were separately prepared by dispersing
tetraethoxy orthosilicate in a surfactant solution at a high
temperature. These MSNPs were then loaded with phyto-
constituent by sonicating them in the presence of a suitable
solvent. The size of MSNPs could be a critical parameter
responsible for the extent of CNS absorption. The particle
size was found to be 263 and 283 nm for curcumin and
chrysin, respectively. Further, cellular uptake of MSNPs
into olfactory cells was conﬁrmed using confocal micro-
scopy. Nontoxicity of MSNPs toward olfactory cells were
reported using MTT assay and live-cell imaging. This study
is only a proof-of-concept study and doesn’t prove the
clinical application of this delivery method.
Salem et al. studied resveratrol-loaded transferosomes
consisting of soy lecithin and cremophor RH 40 and
labeled with gold nanoparticles were found to be effectively
accumulated in the brain after intranasal administration to
rats [101]. Labeling with gold was found to be an effective
technique to accumulate resveratrol in the brain.
Industrial applicability of these novel
technologies and commercial viability
A great deal of research is available on the development of
novel delivery systems that signiﬁcantly increases herbal
drug delivery to the brain. However, not much of that
research has been commercialized. Except Biocurcumax
and Longvida, no novel drug delivery systemebased herbal
drug products, which can be used in cognitive disorders, are
available in pharmacies. Table 24.3 enlists the reasons for
nonavailability of the products based on novel technologies
in the market.
The novel drug delivery systems described in research
mostly comprise of too many steps, and each step must be
controlled within narrow speciﬁcations in order to get
desirable quality attributes. Some processes like lyophili-
zation and spray-drying are very complex and have many
scale-up issues. These processes have a number of critical
parameters that must be controlled within narrow limits,
which is easy on a smaller scale, but becomes difﬁcult on a
larger scale. This also affects the batch reproducibility.
Therefore, commercial manufacturing of such products is
nonrobust and challenging.
The risk of batch reproducibility exists with all the
complex processes, but in the case of herbal drugebased
products, the risk is greater because of nonconsistent
quality raw materials. The quality of herbal drugs or their
extracts depend completely on the conditions of cultivation
and collection. Hence, controlling the quality of these
products is a challenge. With change in quality of raw
materials, the speciﬁcations of the ﬁnal product are greatly
affected.
As seen in the previous sections, many novel delivery
systems involve particles in nanosize which are prone to
coalescence or form aggregates during shelf life. The
techniques to stabilize such nanoparticulate systems are still
under development. So, even after the development of
robust manufacturing process and availability of consistent
quality raw material, the stability issues remain.
Another factor that affects industrial acceptability of
novel technologyebased formulation is storage under
controlled conditions. In case of faulty storage, there is risk
of nonperformance of the product. Also, many of these
products don’t have commercially viable shelf lives.
Regulatory challenges
The regulations for the control of herbal products are
constantly evolving and efforts to make safe and efﬁcacious
products available to consumers are ongoing. In most
countries, these products are treated as dietary supplements,
as they are a part of our regular diet. Thus, the guidelines
available for the control on quality of dietary supplements
must be consulted while designing herbal drug products. In
research, a variety of novel excipients are studied but they
TABLE 24.3 Reasons for fewer novel drug deliveryebased herbal products in the market.
Reasons for fewer novel drug deliveryebased herbal products in the market
1. Complex formulation methods like lyophilization, rotary evaporation, etc., involving number of steps
2. Nonrobust methods: more number of critical process parameters requiring strict control within the narrow limits during operation to
obtain product of desired quality standards
3. Difﬁculty in obtaining ingredients of herbal origin in consistent quality
4. Instability: difﬁculty in retaining the critical quality attributes like size of nanoparticles, in-situ gelling ability, stability of liposomes,
etc., during product shelf life
5. Novel products need storage under cold conditions during shelf life

may not be allowed by the regulatory agencies unless their
safety is proven.
In case of nanotechnology-based delivery systems,
regulatory agencies may demand data on the nontoxicity of
herbal drug in nano-form. At present, the control on quality
nanotechnology-based
pharmaceutical
stricter than nutraceutical products designed using similar
technologies; but with evolving standards, even these
products should have the same standards of quality, efﬁ-
cacy, and safety. This will be more relevant where the use
of a single natural ingredient is made instead of an extract
as many regulatory agencies review such single constituent
products along the lines of pharmaceutical products.
In most countries, labels of all health products are
reviewed critically. Therefore, any novel technologye
based herbal products needs to be tested on human patients
to make claims for its effective brain delivery.
The incidence of neurological disorders, especially AD, is
directly linked with increased age. To discover novel
synthetic drugs for AD will be time-consuming. There are
several herbal drugs that have promising ability to treat
AD and other neurological disorders but lack clinical ef-
ﬁcacy due to nondelivery at the site of action, i.e., brain.
The use of novel technologies of drug delivery allows
these drugs to become available in the CNS in therapeutic
concentrations. Some of the drug delivery techniques,
such as addition of solubilizers, permeation enhancers,
metabolism suppressors, etc., are fairly simple from a
manufacturing and regulatory standpoint. Hence, they can
be easily adopted at the industrial scale. Some techniques
though complex are quite promising. However, there are
few clinical studies evaluating these approaches. There-
fore, there is a need for more clinical data in order to gain
conﬁdence in the ability of these techniques to enhance
CNS delivery of herbal drugs.

In recent decades there have been signiﬁcant advances and
increases in human longevity [1]. This increase in longevity
is represented by an average 5.5-year increase in life
expectancy between 2000 and 2016. In many countries, the
average life expectancy currently exceeds 80 years of age
[1]. Although this increase of lifespan has been seen as a
positive advancement, it has come at a cost. This cost is an
increase in age-related diseases [1]. Age-related and
[1],
cardiovascular diseases [1,2], type 2 diabetes [1,2], stroke,
kidney disease, pulmonary diseases [2], musculoskeletal
disorders [1], and some cancers [1,2].
The brain is a highly complex organ. Its development
begins in the embryo and its plasticity continues and
extends throughout the lifespan [3]. Due the complex
structure and processing demands of the brain it has high
metabolic activity. The brain contributes approximately 2%
of total body weight, but it uses 20% of the total
energy generated from food consumed [3]. Some of the
pathological vascular changes are vessel hemodynamics,
angiogenesis, vascular cell function, and blood-brain

barrier permeability [4]. Common diseases of the aged
brain are the dementias, such as vascular dementia and
Alzheimer disease (AD). As of 2018, dementia was
estimated to affect approximately 50 million people
worldwide and this number is expected to triple by 2050,
the majority of cases being of the Alzheimer type [4]. AD is
a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the predominant
form of dementia [4]. Some of the features of AD include
the cognitive decline, loss of memory, emotional changes,
behavioral changes, psychological impairment, and loss of
motor coordination [4].
Cardiometabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic
disturbances [5] comprising of elevated fasting glucose,
elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, systemic hypertension, and central obesity
[6]. Cardiometabolic risk factors and related cardiovascular
diseases represent major threats to healthy aging [7].
Optimum nutrition plays a role in the prevention and
management of chronic diseases [8]. Nutrient deﬁciencies in
older adults are related to increased risk of cognitive
impairment,
neuromuscular
function,
cardiometabolic and cardiovascular disease [1]. Modern
lifestyles of poor diet and easy access to high-energy,
low-nutrient rich foods and low physical activity are consid-
ered part of the problem [1].
The chapter aims to shed light on the impact of car-
diometabolic disease on brain health and brings attention to
potential diets and nutrients to reduce this impact.
Metabolic syndrome, originally described by Reaven in
1988 [9], is a syndrome comprising of glucose intolerance
[7], elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides, reduced
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [6], hyperten-
sion [6,7,10], and central obesity [6]. Insulin resistance
[10e12], inﬂammation [7], chronic inﬂammation [11,13],
oxidative stress [12,13], endothelial dysfunction [12],
abnormal lipid metabolism [10], stress [7], and a hyper-
coagulable [12] and prothrombotic state [11] have been
associated with cardiometabolic disease. Insulin resistance
is one of the main drivers of cardiometabolic syndrome
[14]. Additionally, overweight and obesity are associated
with increased risk of cardiometabolic syndrome [7,10],
most
active
associations

cardiometabolic disease [15]. The prevalence of car-
diometabolic syndrome ranges from 7% to 34% in adult
males and from 5% to 22% in adult women [5]. Suboptimal
cardiometabolic conditions, such as overweight, prediabe-
tes, and borderline high cholesterol, affect approximately
40% of older people [7].
Cardiometabolic syndrome presents numerous conse-
quences to health, including nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, obesity, overweight, high adiposity, reproductive
polycystic
ovary
syndrome
females
(PCOS), erectile dysfunction in males [11], and obstructive
sleep apnea [7,11]. Cardiometabolic risk factors and related
disorders also contribute to late-life cognitive dysfunction
and impairment [7]. Cardiometabolic syndrome is associ-
ated with a signiﬁcantly increased risk of total mortality and
morbidity
[16]
mortality
[16,17].
Something to note is that people with suboptimal metabolic
conditions, such as prehypertension, prediabetes, over-
weight, and borderline high cholesterol, are at signiﬁcant
risk for further progression to hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
obesity, and high cholesterol, respectively [7].
Metabolic syndrome has been associated with a twofold
increase in cardiovascular outcomes [6], and increased risk
for vascular and degenerative conditions in general popu-
lation [5]. Mortality from cardiometabolic diseases such as
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart
disease has increased [18]. The risk of coronary heart
disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and stroke is

who

syndrome than in those without cardiometabolic syndrome
[14]. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity, deﬁned as any
combination of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and
stroke [15,19], is becoming progressively more common
globally [19]. The prevalence of cardiometabolic comor-
bidities (referred to as multimorbidities) increases with age
and is associated with signiﬁcantly increased risk of
mortality [15]. Multimorbidity is associated with a reduc-
tion or poor quality of life and a greater risk of disability
and mortality [15].
The impact of cardiometabolic disease
on brain and cognitive health
Cardiometabolic syndrome has a greater impact on the body
outside that of the cardiovascular system. It systematically
affects cells, tissues, organs, and body systems, particularly the
dDr. Bradley McEwen
Cardiometabolic risk factors and related disorders
contribute to late-life cognitive dysfunction [7]. Multiple
cardiometabolic risk factors are associated with a substan-
tially increased possibility of mobility limitation and
dementia [7]. Chronic metabolic injury may lead to arte-
riosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis on the cerebral small vessels,
which can result in damage to white matter of the brain,
cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive decline [5].

Altered glucose metabolism and brain health
Blood glucose is the universal metabolic supply of energy
in the human body [3]. As glucose is the preferred source of
energy to the brain, the level of blood glucose plays a major
role in human cognitive processes [3]. There is an essential
relationship between glucose intake and variables affecting
the availability of glucose to the brain, such as diseases or
conditions affecting blood glucose control, fasting, or
hypermetabolism [3]. As glucose cannot be stored in the
brain, a stable and regular supply of blood glucose is
critical to ensure a continual energy supply to the brain [3].
Homeostatic control of blood glucose is regulated by a
complex feedback loop between glucose and insulin [20].
When this is ineffective, it leads to glucose intolerance.
Over time, failure of this feedback loop leads to type 2
diabetes [20]. An increase in the level of glucose in the
blood stimulates insulin secretion and an increase in blood
insulin concentration lowers the blood glucose level [20].
Insulin resistance and its relationship to brain
Insulin is an endocrine hormone that binds to plasma
membraneebound receptors in target cells to coordinate an
integrated anabolic response to nutrient availability [21].
Insulin exerts its physiological effects by binding to the
insulin receptor on the plasma membrane of target cells
[21,22]. Insulin primarily controls metabolic ﬂuxes. An
insulin receptor has two insulin binding sites but exhibits
negative cooperativity. What this means is that the binding
of insulin at one site decreases the binding afﬁnity of
insulin at another site. It is noted that at physiological
concentrations, one insulin molecule binds and activates
one insulin receptor [21]; a one-for-one effect. The insulin
receptor consists of two a subunits and two b subunits that
are disulﬁde linked into an a2b2 heterotetrameric complex.
Insulin binds to the extracellular a subunits, transmitting a
signal across the plasma membrane that activates the
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the b subunit. The
insulin receptor then undergoes a series of intramolecular
transphosphorylation reactions in which one b subunit
phosphorylates its adjacent partner on speciﬁc tyrosine
residues [22]. Insulin is characterized by its direct effects of
glucose homeostasis on skeletal muscle, liver, and white
adipocytes [21]. An important pathway of indirect insulin
action is the suppression of glucagon secretion through
paracrine signaling in the pancreatic islets and insulin
action in the central nervous system [21].
Insulin resistance is deﬁned as the inability of insulin to
stimulate glucose clearance and metabolism [23]. Insulin
resistance can be considered when higher circulating insulin
levels are necessary to achieve the integrated glucose-
lowering response [21]. Insulin resistance may involve the
receptor itself, such as alterations in insulin receptor
expression, insulin receptor binding, phosphorylation state,
and/or kinase activity. In addition, it is possible that the
selected blockade of distinct phosphorylation sites selec-
tively inhibits speciﬁc actions of insulin [22]. Peripheral
insulin resistance can result from a persistent elevation of
circulating glucose, insulin, fatty acids, and cytokines [22].
A range of conditions are associated with insulin resis-
tance, such as metabolic syndrome [23e25], prediabetes
[21],
[24],
risk
[24,25],
[23],
atherogenic
dyslipidemia [25], lipodystrophy, polycystic ovary syn-
drome (PCOS), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [21]. It
is noted that these conditions are accompanied by increased
fasting plasma insulin concentrations [21]. Insulin resistance
represents a major public health problem [25], and further
research should be considered to investigate the impact of
insulin resistance on brain health.
Blood ﬂow, altered platelet function and
coagulation, and brain health
The brain is particularly susceptible to a loss or a reduction
in blood ﬂow [26]. Cerebral ischemia results from the
reduction or inhibition of cerebral blood ﬂow [26]. An
occlusion or constriction of a cerebral artery can lead to
reduced blood ﬂow to the brain [26]. Cerebral blood ﬂow
must be maintained to ensure a constant supply of glucose,
oxygen, and nutrients. Additionally, cerebral blood ﬂow
must be maintained for the removal of waste products [26].
Hemostasis involves a complex system of factors,
which generally form and degrade blood clots [27], and
encompasses the tightly regulated processes of platelet
activation, blood clotting, and vascular repair [28,29].
Hemostasis functions within a ﬁne balance in the formation
of a clot and the subsequent lysis of the clot [27] to keep the
blood in a ﬂuid state [29]. The ﬁrst important component
that contributes to hemostasis starts with platelet adhesion
and activation, which not only contributes to the hemostatic
plug, but also accelerates the coagulation system [29].
Platelets are anucleated cytoplasmic fragments originating
from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow [30]. Platelets
play critical role in hemostasis [31,32], preventing blood
loss when the stability of the vasculature is interrupted, and
in thrombotic vascular disease [33,34]. The interaction of
circulating platelets with the vessel wall involves a process
of cell catch and release, regulating cell rolling, skipping, or
ﬁrm adhesion and leading to thrombus formation in ﬂowing
blood [35]. Platelet adhesion to the atherosclerotic vascular
wall induces thrombosis and augments vascular inﬂam-
mation and the progression of atherosclerosis [36]. Platelets
have long been associated in the pathogenesis of athero-
sclerosis as constituents of the atheroma [37] and arterial
thrombosis [31]. Platelets interact with leukocytes in


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 375

inﬂammatory reactions [38] and monocytes actively bind to
platelets, forming prothrombotic platelet-monocyte aggre-
gates. These aggregates can provide the link between
inﬂammation and the procoagulant state observed in various
prothrombotic conditions, such as coronary artery disease
and type 2 diabetes [39]. Subsequently, during hemostasis,
coagulation factors become activated on the platelet surface
leading to a more dynamic interplay between platelets,
vascular cells, extracellular matrix components, and the
coagulation system [29]. Thrombin is the key effector
enzyme of coagulation [40]. Thrombin exerts a multitude of
highly regulated actions on the blood and vessel walls,
including the clotting of ﬁbrinogen [41] and formation of the
ﬁbrin clot, and plays an essential role in activating platelets
[42]. Fibrinogen and ﬁbrin play overlapping roles in blood
clotting, ﬁbrinolysis, cellular and matrix interactions, the
inﬂammatory response, and wound healing [43]. Thrombin
and ﬁbrin are key molecular players of coagulation that are
epidemiologically and mechanistically linked with diseases
with an inﬂammatory component [44].
The vascular endothelium is the single-cell-thick lining
of the blood vessel wall [45] and plays an integral role in the
regulation of vascular tone, platelet activity, leukocyte
adhesion,
thrombosis
[46].
endothelium
intimately involved in the development of atherosclerosis
[37,46]. Viscosity of the blood is important in the develop-
ment of damage following changes in shear forces at the
endothelial surface and in predicting adverse events [37].
Vascular integrity and blood ﬂuidity are maintained by
complex interplay between procoagulant and anticoagulant
properties provided by the blood, the vasculature, and
subvascular elements [47].
Thrombosis is a complex and episodic disease and can be
deﬁned as the pathological presence of a blood clot
(thrombus). Venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis are
considered distinct disease states having different pathogenic
mechanisms and underlying risk factors [48]. Platelets,
coagulation factors [49], and ﬁbrin formation [50] are
involved in arterial thrombus formation. Under normal
circumstances, the coagulation system is balanced in favor of
anticoagulation [40].
Atherosclerosis and brain health
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inﬂammatory response of the
vascular wall in reaction to endothelial distress and dysli-
pidemia involving the inﬂammatory recruitment of leuko-
cytes and activation of endothelium [51]. Arterial stiffening
is the ﬁrst major stage in the development of atherosclerosis
[52]. Atherosclerotic plaque forms in the intima layer of
arterial walls. As the plaque grows, the artery wall degrades
until the plaque ruptures, which can cause occlusion of the
artery and blood clots to form [52]. The inﬂammatory
activity in atherosclerosis is not only conﬁned to a small
number of atherosclerotic lesions, but is present in all
atherosclerotic lesions throughout the vascular system [51].
Platelets contribute to the initiation, formation, pro-
gression, and exacerbation of atherosclerotic plaques via
their secretory functions and as important modulators of
inﬂammatory and immune responses [51]. Coagulation is
accelerated at sites of platelet deposition due to the
procoagulant activity of platelets. In the presence of an
activated and dysfunctional endothelium, severe vasocon-
striction and shear forces at the atherosclerotic plaque can
increase to such a level that it could cause endothelial
damage followed by platelet deposition and thrombus
formation [51].
Inﬂammation and brain health
Inﬂammation means “to set on ﬁre” [53]. Inﬂammation is the
immune system’s response to harmful stimuli, such as
damaged cells, toxic compounds, pathogens, or radiation.
Inﬂammation acts by removing damaging stimuli and
initiating the healing process [54]. Inﬂammation and the
dysregulation of inﬂammatory pathways lead to the devel-
opment of chronic diseases [53], including neurodegenera-
tive diseases [53], neurological diseases [53], respiratory
diseases [53], cardiovascular diseases [53,54], atheroscle-
rosis [54], type 2 diabetes [53], asthma [54], autoimmune
diseases [54], arthritis [53,54], cancer [53,54], nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease [55], and bowel diseases [54].
Oxidative stress and brain health
Oxidative stress occurs from the imbalance between the
body’s antioxidant defenses and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production
[56]. Oxidative stress and free radical damage are involved
in the initiation and progression of numerous chronic
conditions, such as [56], neurodegenerative diseases [56],
cardiovascular diseases [54,56], hypertension [54], athero-
sclerosis [54], type 2 diabetes [54,56], chronic kidney
disease [56], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [56],
asthma [54], nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [55], autoim-
mune diseases [54], macular degeneration [56], cancer
[54,56], sarcopenia [56], and frailty [56].
Thyroid function, cardiometabolic proﬁle, and
There is a potential link between thyroid function, car-
diometabolic proﬁle, and brain health. Thyroid hormones
have a signiﬁcant impact on the function and structure of
the heart and cardiovascular system [57]. Hypothyroidism
can result in decreased cardiac output, increased systemic
vascular resistance [58], decreased arterial compliance
[58,59], and atherosclerosis [58]. It is to be noted that both


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 376

hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism produce changes in
cardiac contractility, myocardial oxygen consumption,
blood pressure [59], cardiac output, and systemic vascular
resistance [58,59].
The effect of nutritional medicine on
cardiometabolic disease and cognitive
Optimum nutrition and nutritional status play a funda-
mental role in optimum health [8]. The brain is made up of
distinct regions (such as hippocampus, cortex, striatum,
cerebellum) and processes (such as myelination, neuro-
transmitters), each of which has a different developmental
trajectory and set of nutrient requirements [60]. It is noted
that all nutrients are important for structural and functional
brain development [60], therefore optimizing nutrition is of
utmost importance. Research links chronic undernutrition
and micronutrient deﬁciency to cognitive deﬁcits [61].
Management aims
There are several aims for improving brain health and the
management of cardiometabolic risk factors. These aims
include:
Improve cerebral and overall blood ﬂow
Improve endothelial function
Reduce inﬂammation
Reduce oxidative stress
Improve glucose metabolism
resistance
Improve overall nutritional status
Diet plays a major role in optimizing nutritional status [8].
In this section, the Westernized diet will be introduced
along with the health beneﬁts of the Mediterranean diet,
low glycemic index diet, ketogenic diet, and vegetarian and
vegan diets.
Westernized diet
The Westernized diet is characterized by a higher intake of
reﬁned foods, red and processed meats, sweets, desserts,
potatoes, fries, reﬁned grains [62], and high amounts of
sugar and saturated fat [63]. The Western diet has been
associated with accelerating the aging process of the brain
[3]. A diet high in these foods has been associated with:
metabolic syndrome [11].
cardiovascular disease [11].
low-grade inﬂammation [64].
insulin resistance [64].
higher cardiovascular mortality [11].
Mediterranean diet
The Mediterranean diet is associated with slowed aging of
the brain and improved cognitive functioning [3]. The
Mediterranean diet is characterized by abundant fruits,
vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, breads, cereals, and ﬁsh.
Olive oil is the principal source of fat. Fresh fruit is the
typical daily dessert [65]. The Mediterranean diet has been
associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in total mortality
[66e69], reduced incidence of death due to coronary heart
disease [66], lower risk of cardiovascular disease [69],
lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes [69], and a lower
risk of incident cardiovascular disease and stroke in women
[70]. It is also associated with a signiﬁcant lower average
heart rate [69], blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol levels
[71], and lower risk of depression [69].
Low glycemic index diet
The regulation of glycemia (due to food with a low gly-
cemic index ensuring a low insulin level) improves the
quality and duration of cognitive performance [72]. The
glycemic
quantiﬁes
glycemic
response
carbohydrates in different foods and beverages [73]. Foods
and beverages with high glycemic index, such as white
bread, potatoes, white rice, low-ﬁber breakfast cereals,
sweets, desserts, and sugar-sweetened beverages, have been
linked to cardiovascular disease [73], type 2 diabetes [73],
procoagulant
inﬂammation,
low-density lipoprotein oxidation [74], and weight gain
[11]. Low-glycemic index diets have been associated with a
reduced risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular
disease and type 2 diabetes [73], along with improved
fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, blood pressure, waist
circumference, and body mass index [75].
Vegetarian and vegan diet
Vegetarian diets encompass several diet types. These diets
semi-vegetarian
(ﬂexitarian),
pesco-vegetarian,
lacto-vegetarian, ovo-vegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and
vegan diet. Individuals who follow vegan diets exclude all
meats and animal products [76]. Vegetarian diets, including
vegan diets, have numerous beneﬁts for cardiovascular
health [77], reduced blood pressure [76e78], improved
glycemic control (reduce glycated hemoglobin) [77],
reduced glucose levels [76], reduced plasma lipids [76,77],
and lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol [78].
Reduce sugar
Reducing sugars in the diet has signiﬁcant health beneﬁts.
A high intake of sugar has been associated with cardio-
vascular disease [79], metabolic syndrome [80,81], type 2
diabetes [79,80,82], obesity [83], overweight [83], weight
gain [80], adiposity [79], cardiorenal disease [84], gout
[79], and fatty liver disease [79,85].

This section discusses the functions and uses of vitamin B1,
vitamin B2, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C,
vitamin D, vitamin E, tocotrienols, and vitamin K2.
Vitamin B1
Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is involved in energy metabolism
[86,87], the metabolism of glucose [88], mitochondrial
metabolism of glucose [89], cell signaling [87], metabolism
of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine [89], nerve structure
and function [90], and is essential for nerve conduction and
excitability [91], cell-membrane dynamics [87], and mod-
ulates cognitive performance [92]. Deﬁciency of thiamine
is common in older adults [1]. A deﬁciency of thiamine is
associated with memory impairment [86,89,90] and is a
risk factor for heart failure, peripheral neuropathy, and
encephalopathy [1].
Vitamin B2
Vitamin B2 (riboﬂavin) is necessary for energy meta-
bolism, normal cell function, and growth [93]. Vitamin B2
is essential for proper functioning of the nervous, endo-
crine, cardiovascular, and immune systems [94], the normal
functioning of glutathione reductase [94], along with the
metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids [93].
It is also involved in the conversion of vitamin B6 and folic
acid into their active coenzyme forms [93]. Vitamin B2
deﬁciency
signs
symptoms
degenerative
changes in the nervous system, dysfunction of the endo-
crine system, skin disorders, and anemia [93].
Vitamin B6
Vitamin B6 is involved in the metabolism of one-carbon
units [93,95]; trans-sulfuration [95]; the metabolism of
protein,
carbohydrates,
lipids;
gluconeogenesis;
neurological development; immune function; metabolism
of homocysteine; and formation of hemoglobin [93].
Pyridoxyl-5-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin
B6, plays an important role in metabolism of neurotrans-
mitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [95]. A deﬁciency of
vitamin B6 has been associated with impaired glucose
tolerance [96], depression [96,97], confusion [97], inﬂam-
mation [95], and anemia [97]. Low vitamin B6 plasma
levels are associated with the increased risk of arterial and
venous thrombosis [93].
Folate
Folate is an umbrella term that is often used to describe
folic
acid,
folinic
acid,
5-methyltetrahydrofolate
(5-MTHF). Folate is essential for neural tube closure and
neuronal structure [60]. It is required for critical enzymatic
reactions, including those involved in amino acid meta-
bolism,
purine
pyrimidine
synthesis,
methylation [93]. A deﬁciency of folate is common in older
adults [1]. A deﬁciency of folate results in cognitive
impairment [1], reduced DNA synthesis and cell division,
normal synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, peripheral
neuropathy [93], depression, weakness, fatigue, elevated
homocysteine, anemia [1], and macrocytic anemia [93,98].
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for synthesis and
regulation
[93,97],
methylation
[60,89,99],
involved in neuronal structure [60], the synthesis of
neurotransmitters [92], nerve conduction and excitability
[91], cell metabolism, synthesis of purines and pyrimidines,
synthesis of fatty acids, and energy metabolism [93], and
metabolism of homocysteine [1,89,99]. Vitamin B12 can
improve cognitive function, especially in the elderly [92].
Deﬁciency of B12 is common in older adults and is
often underdiagnosed [1]. Absorption of vitamin B12
decreases mainly due to high prevalence of age-related
atrophic gastritis [1]. Vitamin B12 deﬁciency has been
associated with a higher incidence of cognitive impairment
[1], neurological disorders [97], cardiovascular disease,
weakness, fatigue [1].
Vitamin C is involved in the synthesis and metabolism of
catecholamines, collagen, and carnitine and the metabolism
of tyrosine [93]. It maintains the immune system and
immune cell function [1], and is an antiinﬂammatory agent
[100]. Inadequate vitamin C intake is very common among
adults [1]. A deﬁciency of vitamin C leads to vasomotor
instability, poor wound healing, and connective tissue
disorders [93]. Smoking increases the need of vitamin C [1].
Vitamin D is a “multi-purpose” nutrient. Vitamin D is
involved in differentiation [101], gene expression [101],
neuroprotection
[101],
improving
sensitivity
[102,103],
enhancing
calcium
absorption
[1,101,102],
maintaining calcium levels in the blood [1], peak bone
mass [104], bone mineral density [105], promoting bone
mineralization [106], skeletal growth [105], optimal muscle
function [101], and a has an immunoregulatory role [101].
Vitamin D has a multitude of uses, including chronic
disease [101,103,104,107], metabolic syndrome [103,107],
cardiovascular disease [101e104], depression [101], bone
loss [108], osteomalacia [104,107], osteoporosis [104,107],
osteoarthritis
[107],
muscle
weakness
[101,104,107],
muscle pain [104,107], autoimmune diseases [101], asthma
[101], and allergies [101].

Older adults have less exposure to the sun and have
diminished ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D and
for the liver and kidney to hydrolyze and activate vitamin D
with age [1].
Tocotrienols and tocopherols (vitamin E) are antioxidants
and free radical scavengers [93]. Tocotrienols exhibit
antioxidant [109e114], antiinﬂammatory [109e112,114],
cholesterol-lowering [110,112,115], hypoglycemic [111],
hepatoprotective [111], neuroprotective [114,116e120],
nephroprotective [111], antiangiogenic [109], and immu-
nomodulatory [111] properties. Vitamin E protects cell
membranes from oxidative damage [93].
Tocotrienols are more readily transferred and incorporated
into cell membranes than tocopherols [109,121]. Cellular
uptake of tocotrienols is up to 70 times higher than that of
tocopherols [109]. The administration of 750 and 1000 mg of
a tocotrienol mixture from Annatto (Bixa orellana) resulted in
a maximum plasma concentration levels at 3e4 h for all
isomers, whereas a-tocopherol peaked at 6 h [122].
Vitamin K2
Vitamin K is a group of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin K is
considered to be one of the essential cofactors for the
production of several proteins that are involved in the
homeostasis of coagulation and calcium homeostasis [123].
There are 14 different vitamin K-dependent proteins found
in blood, bone, dentin, neural tissue, atherosclerotic pla-
ques, lung surfactants, semen, renal stones, and urine [124].
It is involved in nervous tissue biochemistry [92]. There are
three vitamin K-dependent proteins in bone; these being
osteocalcin (synthesized in cartilage and in blood vessel
walls) [123e125], matrix Gla protein, and protein S [124].
Vitamin K is involved in calcium transport [123], pre-
vents calcium deposition in the lining of blood vessel walls
[123], is necessary for normal bone metabolism [108],
regulates bone remodeling [124], promotes bone marrow
stem cell proliferation [124], promotes osteoblast differ-
entiation, upregulates transcription of speciﬁc genes in
osteoblasts [1], stimulates osteoblast differentiation [124],
protects osteoblasts from apoptosis [124], cofactor in the
g-carboxylation of glutamyl residues on osteocalcin and
other bone proteins [108], and inhibits adipocyte differen-
tiation [124]. Vitamin K2 is essential for coagulation [108].
Vitamin K-dependent proteins synthesized primarily in the
liver are coagulation factors (VII, IX, X, prothrombin)
protein C, protein S, and protein Z [108,124].
Typical uses for vitamin K2 include abnormal clotting
and clotting disorders [108], osteoporosis [108], lower bone
mineral density [108], and arterial stiffness [126]. Vitamin K
supplementation has been found to improve insulin sensi-
tivity and glucose tolerance, reduce insulin resistance, and
reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes [127]. Vitamin K2 had a
better effect than vitamin K1 on Type 2 diabetes [128].
Minerals
This section discusses the functions and uses of calcium,
iodine, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc.
Calcium
Calcium is involved in signal transduction [129], cell
signaling [130], the mineralization of bone [131], structural
components of bones and teeth [129], regulation of muscle
contraction [129,130], enzyme regulation [129], and blood
clotting [129]. Chronic calcium deﬁciency can lead to low
bone mass, rapid bone loss, high fracture rates [1], osteo-
malacia, osteopenia, and osteoporosis [132].
Iodine
Iodine deﬁciency is the leading cause of preventable impaired
mental function worldwide [60]. Iodine is an essential
component of thyroid hormones [133], and is involved in
myelination, synaptogenesis, and energy metabolism [60].
Iodine deﬁciency can result in hypothyroidism, goiter, and
thyroid nodules [133].
Iron
Iron is involved in energy production in the cerebral
parenchyma (functional tissue in the brain), modulation of
cerebral development [92], myelination, synthesis of neu-
rotransmitters [61,92,134], monoamine neurotransmission
[60], energetics [60], and oxygenation [92].
Iron deﬁciency is regarded as the most common nutri-
tional deﬁciency in the world [60]. Deﬁciency of iron has
been associated with poorer cognitive performance [61],
decreased attention, inability to concentrate [92], alterations
in brain energy metabolism [134], weakness, fatigue [1],
anemia [1], apathy, and irritability [92]. Anemia is a
signiﬁcant risk factor for cognitive insufﬁciency [61].
Magnesium
Magnesium participates in over 300 enzyme reactions [93].
Magnesium is involved in mitochondrial health [135];
neurotransmission [135]; maintenance of normal nerve
function and neurotransmitters [135]; the synthesis of
adenosine triphosphate, DNA, and RNA [93]; and main-
tains muscle integrity and function [1].
A deﬁciency of magnesium leads to muscle spasms and
has been associated with numbness and tingling [135],
anxiety [93], cardiovascular diseases [93,136], type 2
diabetes [93,136], and elevated blood pressure [93].
Selenium
Selenium is functionally essential for the central nervous
system, the cardiovascular system, reproductive biology,
the endocrine system, muscle function, and immune
response [137]. Selenium is an antioxidant [93,137], a


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 379

cofactor for glutathione peroxidase [93,137,138], and
thioredoxin reductases [137,138], plays a role in the func-
tioning of the thyroid gland [93,137]. Selenium is involved
in synaptogenesis, myelination, and neuronal cell differ-
entiation [61]. It may impact cognitive function by
protecting the brain from oxidative damage [61]. Selenium
is involved in redox reactions that can affect cellular
processes, such as the repair of DNA [137].
Selenium deﬁciency has been linked to cognitive
decline [1], cardiovascular disease [1], cardiomyopathy
[137], oxidative stress [137,138], reduced immune response
[1], osteochondral diseases [137], and various chronic
degenerative diseases [138]. The development of depres-
sion and the intensiﬁcation and escalation of anxiety have
been observed in people with selenium deﬁciency [138].
Zinc
Zinc is a component of over 300 metalloenzymes that
catalyze greater than 50 different physiologic reactions
[139]. Zinc is a component of thousands of transcription
factor proteins characterized as “zinc ﬁngers” and related
structures [139]. Zinc is an antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory
nutrient. It is essential for growth and development
[140,141], the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal trans-
duction, synaptic plasticity [93], synaptic efﬁcacy [60], and
gene expression [93].
Zinc deﬁciency has been linked with impaired cognition
[139],
emotional
instability,
irritability,
depression [142], skin lesions [139,142], taste abnormal-
ities, abnormal water balance, decreased immunity [139],
growth impairment [142], and impaired immunity [1]. Zinc
deﬁciency and low intracellular zinc have been associated
with oxidative stress, reduced antioxidant defenses, DNA
damage, and altered DNA repair [142].
Other nutrients
Coenzyme Q10 levels fall with aging in human tissues
[143]. Coenzyme Q10 is involved in mitochondrial bio-
energetics [144] and mitochondrial oxidative phosphory-
lation [145], and is a component of the electron-transport
chain, which is responsible for the generation of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) molecules [145e147]. It is an antioxi-
dant [144,147] and endogenous lipid-soluble antioxidant
[148]. It is an intracellular antioxidant that protects mem-
brane phospholipids, mitochondrial membrane proteins,
and LDL-C from free radical-induced oxidative damage
[148]. It neutralizes the damaging effects of free radicals
[146]. Coenzyme Q10 is an antiinﬂammatory nutrient [148]
that has shown reduction of TNF-a, IL-6, NF-kB [148]. It
reduces overall peripheral resistance [145] and improves
heart ejection function [145], has a hypotensive action
[144], and improves endothelial function [144]. It plays a
role in energy transfer in skeletal muscle [147]. It
counteracts testosterone reduction induced by chemical
reproductive
toxicants,
mainly
counteracting
destructive effect of the generated pro-oxidants [146].
Coenzyme Q10 has applications in coronary artery
disease [148], ischemic heart disease [144], endothelial
dysfunction [144], and statin-related myopathy [147].
Coenzyme Q10 is especially beneﬁcial for those with
fatigue among healthy, ﬁbromyalgia, statin-related fatigue,
multiple sclerosis and end-stage heart failure subjects [149].
A slight change in the levels of coenzyme Q10 may lead to
signiﬁcant alterations in the rate of respiration [145]. Statin
medications can reduce the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10
[147,148]. Therefore, coenzyme Q10 supplementation for
patients taking statins should be considered.
N-acetyl cysteine
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an amino acid that contains a
thiol group [150]. NAC has numerous cardioprotective
properties,
property
[150e152],
decreasing
[150],
antiinﬂammatory
property [151], improving lipid proﬁle [150], reducing
paracetamol toxicity, along with mucolytic and detoxiﬁ-
cation properties [150]. NAC is one of the precursors of
glutathione, which is an important antioxidant [150,152].
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
Omega-3 are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). PUFA
are long chains of carbons with two or more double bonds
[153]. The two main long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA)
components of omega-3 are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,
20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) [153].
Omega-3 is involved in cell membrane composition and
function [8,153]; decreases platelet activation and aggre-
gation [8,153,154]; reduces ﬁbrin generation, velocity of
ﬁbrin polymerization, and peak thrombin generated [155];
anti-inﬂammatory function [8,153]; vascular relaxation [8];
endothelium
[153];
proﬁle,
including the reduction of triglycerides [153] and very
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) [153]; and reduces car-
diovascular risk and cardiovascular mortality [153,156].
Omega-3 has shown beneﬁts in cardiovascular disease
[8,72,153e156], depression [72,156], inﬂammation [153],
hypercholesterolaemia [153], rheumatoid arthritis [157],
systemic lupus erythematosus [157], and osteoarthritis
[157].
The brain is a highly complex organ. Cognitive decline and
dementias are common conditions in the aging population.

Cardiometabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic dis-
turbances, including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance,
and inﬂammation. Optimum nutrition plays a major role in
the prevention and management of chronic diseases and
shows beneﬁt in brain health and improving the impact of
cardiometabolic disease on cognitive function.

Clinical recommendations and application
Vitamin B6, B12, and folate
Dementia, a potentially devastating neurocognitive disorder,
presents one of the greatest emerging challenges to the
medical world with each passing year. For a long time it was
considered nonpreventable, but emerging research may seek
to challenge this belief. One predominant subset of research
focuses on the role of vitamins in cognitive and neurological
function.

appropriate physiological function of the human body.
Given that vitamins are not endogenously manufactured,
they must be obtained primarily through dietary intake. The
B group of vitamins are made up of eight members,
including vitamins thiamine (B1), riboﬂavin (B2), niacin
(B3), pantothenic acid (B5), B6, folate (B9), and cobalamins
(B12). These are typically synthesized in plants, apart from
vitamin B12 which is usually derived from bacteria.
This chapter focuses on three B vitamins, B6, B9, and
B12, which are frequently linked to cognitive and neuro-
logical functions and diseases. Their roles in development
of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as their
applications in the clinical management of these conditions
are discussed.
Of the multiple types of dementia, AD is one of the most
common. This disorder is characterized by its progressive
decline in memory, receptive and expressive speech
(aphasia), coordination (apraxia), recognition of familiar
objects (agnosia), and ability to conduct planned and
routine activities. Development is often linked to oxidative
stress and formation of amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary
tangles in cerebral tissue [1,2].
B6 (pyridoxine)
Vitamin B6, commonly found in cells as pyridoxal phos-
phate, is a coenzyme linked to amino acid and protein
metabolism, with involvement in the creation of neuro-
transmitters dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), and noradrenaline. Deﬁciency is known to result
in downregulation of GABA and serotonin neurotransmit-
ters impacting regulation of neural activity, affecting sleep,
behavior, and cardiovascular function. Vitamin B6 deﬁ-
ciency has been shown to cause inﬂammatory and immune
activation, resulting in clinical manifestations such as
anemia, dermatitis, gastrointestinal abnormalities, seizures

in children, mental deterioration (depression, memory loss).
Deﬁciencies eventually result in inﬂammatory processes
leading to pathological states such as dementia and
cognitive decline. These commonly present in older
patients, due to impaired absorption from the gastrointes-
tinal tract, and in those suffering from alcohol dependence.
Levels of pyridoxal 50 phosphate (PLP) in the blood can be
used to diagnose B6 deﬁciencies [1e4].
Vitamin B9 (folate)
Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) is critical in the formation
of purines and thymine essential for DNA synthesis.
Deﬁciencies of folic acid are often linked to a concurrent
vitamin B12 deﬁciency leading to impaired DNA stability
and ability to repair. These result in growth defects,
commonly known to cause in-utero congenital spinal
defects in the human fetus. In adults this can result in
atrophy,
demyelination
syndromes,
impaired neuronal function [1,3,5]. Given the hippocampus

development of dementia and cognitive decline. Increased

deﬁciency. Initial diagnosis of folate deﬁciency involves
testing serum folate and for longer-term status, red cell
folate. Total plasma homocysteine is also a good marker of
folate status, with higher amounts correlating to folate
deﬁciency. Folate deﬁciency necessitates the testing for
vitamin B12 deﬁciency as they are frequently linked.
Treatment involves supplementation to improve the vitamin
B12 deﬁciency prior to oral supplementation with folic acid
[2,6e8].
Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)
Cobalamin compounds, similar to folic acid, are linked to
the process of DNA replication through their action of
reducing ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. These
assist in the growth and development of the organism,
promote appropriate functioning of the central and peripheral
nervous system, and are involved in the formation of red
blood cells. Deﬁciency of vitamin B12 is often seen to result
in failed red blood cell maturation, known as pernicious
anemia [1,3]. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deﬁciencies are
linked to severe neurological sequelae, including peripheral
neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord
[2,5]. Serum cobalamin alone may not be adequate to
diagnose deﬁciency. Diagnosis begins with a basic full red
cell examination, including mean cell volume and ﬁlm. This
is combined with a serum cobalamin. This can be followed
by measuring total plasma homocysteine, which is a more
sensitive marker of cobalamin deﬁciency, and increases as
the deﬁciency worsens. Homocysteine is also elevated in
folate and B6 deﬁciency, as well as in renal failure and
hypothyroidism. The most sensitive options include serum
plasma
methylmalonic
(MMA)
holotrans-
cobalamin; however, routine use of these tests is expensive
and currently considered as adjunct testing. Holotrans-
cobalamin is slated to become a routine diagnostic test of
vitamin B12 deﬁciency. Supplementation is in the form of
an intramuscular injection of hydroxocobalamin with side
effects including pruritus, fevers, nausea, and occasional
anaphylaxis. Oral cobalamin is also available and has similar
efﬁcacy to intramuscular forms except in severe deﬁciencies
possibly due to poor absorption in the gut [6,9e15].
Homocysteine
The “homocysteine hypothesis” features predominantly a
thorough research into the effect of these B vitamins on
cognition. High levels of plasma homocysteine were noted
to adversely affect the risks of cardiovascular disease and
cognitive dysfunction including development of dementia
and AD [1,16].
Homocysteine is a product of the methionine cycle
commonly thought to contribute to cognitive disease
through oxidative stress and increasing damage to DNA
and its repair mechanisms leading to neurotoxicity and cell
death. B vitamins, primarily folate and vitamin B12, are
linked to the breakdown of plasma homocysteine and hence
theorized to reduce its harmful impacts on cognition and
neurological function. Hence, a deﬁciency in these vitamins
causes an elevated total plasma homocysteine, resulting in
cognitive and neurodegenerative decline [1,16e19].
Cognitive decline, dementia, and the
homocysteine hypothesisdwhat is the
evidence showing?
The homocysteine hypothesis has led to research into the
effects of vitamin B6, folate, and B12 deﬁciencies on
cognitive decline and development of dementia as well as
their role in prevention. Most of the deﬁciencies in these
vitamins result from dietary causes. Elevated total plasma
homocysteine results in long-term effects on the brain. These
include damage to both white and gray matter, including
atrophy in critical regions and neuroﬁbrillary tangle depo-
sition over periods of up to 35 years. Homocysteine acts as a
reasonable marker for the risk of neurodegenerative disease
and dementia. Vitamin B supplementation has been shown
to reduce its plasma concentration [20]. Early reports linked
homocysteine to higher risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular
diseases, hence its association with vascular dementia.
However, these diagnoses on autopsy also found character-
istic features of AD. There are many studies that have
explored the effect of a vitamin B deﬁciency on cognition
and further neurodegenerative disease, with regard to the
homocysteine hypothesis.

Bhatti et al. [2] highlight the association between high
homocysteine concentrations in plasma and increased
oxidative stress in the body. B vitamins play a role in
decreasing the level of total plasma homocysteine and may
contribute to reducing this risk factor. They link vitamin B6
deﬁciency to white matter lesions in patients with AD,
which may be a result of metal centered oxidative stress,
commonly inhibited by the vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)
complex [2,21]. Folate deﬁciency was also linked to
cerebral atrophy, cell apoptosis due to calcium inﬂux, as
well as formation of neuroﬁbrillary tangles and aggregation
of beta-amyloid proteins [2,22,23]. These may allow it to
act as a predictor for the development of AD and they
provide examples of studies that correlate high folate intake
to reduced incidence or risk of developing AD. As vitamin
B12 deﬁciency results in higher concentrations of plasma
homocysteine, they also highlight the relationship between
elevated plasma homocysteine and gray matter atrophy in
regions linked to AD as a possible predictive factor
[2,24,25].
Hughes et al. [26] investigated the link between low
dietary intake of the B vitamins and cognitive decline in
healthy individuals with a follow-up period of 4 years [26].
Many trials to date are inconclusive with regards to role of
vitamin B supplementation in preventing cognitive decline
with aging. However, many of these studies had not been
done on vitamin B-deﬁcient individuals, and involved short
follow-up periods [27e31]. Drawing from the VITACOG
study [32], which showed that vitamin B supplementation
had positive effects on cognition in those with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and high plasma homocyste-
ine, they sought to supplement this study by also focusing
on the role of vitamin B6 in the diet. Participants were
derived from the UK Food Standards Agency and excluded
those with cognitive impairment on Mini-mental state
examination (MMSE), vitamin B12 deﬁciency, chronic
vascular or renal disease, confounding medications or those
already on vitamin B supplementation whether via fortiﬁed
supplements.
measured
biomarkers, including the sensitive holotranscobalamin and
methylmalonic acid. Vitamin B6 was seen to be an
important biomarker of cognitive decline in healthy older
adults based on their MMSE. Low vitamin B6 in serum and
low dietary intake contributed to a fourfold increase in risk
of cognitive decline with aging, whereas with vitamin B12
or folate no correlation was observed [26].
In contrast, Agnew-Blais et al. [33] assessed the role of
folate, vitamin B6, and B12 dietary intake on MCI and
development of dementia in older women, drawing from
the Women’s Health Initiative Hormone Trial [34e36].
Their subset had no dementia at baseline and underwent
initial MMSE, blood biomarkers, and a CT brain to exclude
other abnormalities. They found that below recommended
dietary folate intake was linked to increased risk of
developing MCI or dementia in older women. However,
low dietary vitamin B6 and B12 were not linked to an
increased risk. Folate supplementation was deemed to
potentially provide protective factors to cognitive decline in
those with dietary insufﬁciency; however, they were not
able to identify if other nutritional confounders contributed
to this result. Staying on the subject of folate, Lefèvre-

France,
encompassing those with diagnoses of dementia, and
identiﬁed that high dietary folate intake also lowered their
risk of dementia, even AD [38]. There was once again no
link found between vitamin B6 and B12 intake and
dementia. This study only assessed their intake over a 24-h
period, which may not represent their usual dietary habits,
and had no assessment of their plasma homocysteine or B
vitamin status. With a large component of vitamin B
deﬁciencies resulting from dietary factors, Horvat et al. [39]
sought to investigate the association between serum folate
and vitamin B12 and cognitive function in middle age and
older adults from the HAIPEE study in Eastern European
populations [39,40]. The study however could not account
for the quantity and type of supplementation and did
not investigate dementia in particular. However, they were
able to identify that higher levels of serum folate were
linked with better letter search performance, verbal ﬂuency,
and immediate recall. Higher vitamin B12 levels were
linked to better immediate/delayed recall and verbal
ﬂuency. While no clear conclusion can be derived from
this, it highlights the complexities of the homocysteine
hypothesis and investigating potential beneﬁts of vitamin B
supplementation.
A crucial component of the homocysteine hypothesis is
methionine, an amino acid, commonly sourced from meat,
cheese, dairy, and ﬁsh. Homocysteine is a product of
methionine
metabolism.
Subsequently
homocysteine requires the B vitamins, B6, folate, and B12
[41]. As highlighted above, the evidence does indicate that
deﬁciencies in these B vitamins can link to adverse cogni-
tive consequences. As per the homocysteine hypothesis,
elevated plasma levels are linked with the risk of developing
dementia, AD, and cerebrovascular disorders. Nuru et al.
[41] identiﬁed that high methionine and vitamin B-deﬁcient
diets in mice can predispose them to neurodegenerative
disorders. These sustained diets caused neuronal dysfunc-
tion and degeneration, cerebrovascular dysfunction, as well
as memory deﬁcits over a 6-week period, which may be
further correlated to human diets [41].
One of the hallmarks of AD is disordered protein
aggregates of tau and Ab. Tau is critical to microtubule
stabilization and protecting DNA from environmental
stress. Raﬁee et al. [42] identiﬁed that vitamin B12 is
directly linked to homocysteine metabolism via activation
of PP2A, involved in regulating phosphorylation of tau
protein. Conversely, a vitamin B12 deﬁciency inhibits this

development of AD.
whether
deﬁciencies is of any beneﬁt is unclear. Furthermore,
measuring levels of serum B12 alone is inadequate to
diagnose vitamin B12 deﬁciency. As the review by J. D.
Spence [47] explains, B12 deﬁciencies can commonly be
missed, easily managed, and frequently contribute to
cognitive decline and cerebrovascular disease in the older
population [47,48]. Measurement of holotranscobalamin or
methylmalonic acid as well as total plasma homocysteine is
an essential functional marker of vitamin B12 sufﬁciency
[47]. Deﬁciency in intrinsic factors with age may contribute
to an increased incidence of metabolic B12 deﬁciency due
to difﬁculty with absorption. This in turn raises total
plasma homocysteine. The homocysteine and B vitamins in
cognitive impairment trial identiﬁed that administration of
B12 supplementation slowed rates of gray matter atrophy
in regions involved in AD in those with high plasma
homocysteine [48].
The large majority of trials studying the effect of
supplementation using B vitamins have either been incon-
clusive or found that lowering total plasma homocysteine
may not prevent cognitive decline or dementia; however
few of these trials had enough sample size or power for
accurate correlation [20]. The FACIT trial was one
conducted on a sample of 818 from the Netherlands with
high total plasma homocysteine but with normal vitamin
B12. They underwent folic acid supplementation and were
noted to have a reduction in total homocysteine levels
control.
assessment,
several
cognitive parameters including sensorimotor speed, infor-
mation processing, and complex thought had declined
slower in the treatment arm with an overall improvement in
global cognitive performance in this group [49]. This,
coupled with the large VITACOG study, presents a greater
level of evidence that vitamin B deﬁciencies, if treated, may
slow the progress of cognitive decline, particularly if
studies are conducted using relevant outcome measures
over longer follow-up periods [32].
One of the most comprehensive reviews includes the
Cochrane database of systematic reviews. McCleery et al.
[50] highlighted how large sets of studies into these topics
were only able to provide low level evidence into the effects
of vitamin B supplementation on cognition and dementia.
Of the ﬁve trials reviewed, a total of 879 participants, none
found a clear effect of supplementation on overall cognitive
function or incidence of dementia. As mentioned earlier, the
best level of evidence came from the study linking
supplementation to slower rates of gray matter atrophy, as
well as reduced levels of plasma homocysteine, which may
correlate to improved episodic memory in those with high
plasma homocysteine initially [51].
This study was a randomized control trial that investi-
gated the link between gray matter atrophy in critical brain
regions related to AD and vitamin B12 supplementation
[51]. While a large number of other cross-sectional and
prospective studies show a link between raised total plasma
homocysteine levels and risk of cognitive impairment or
dementia, few have been conclusive in proving that
reducing levels of plasma homocysteine have any effect on
improving these risk factors [52,53]. One of the largest
factors contributing to these results is the inability of
neuropsychological testing alone to extensively assess for
long-term cognitive changes. This study derived from the
VITACOG trial [32] to investigate thorough use of neu-
roimaging if supplementation with vitamin B showed any
change in gray matter volume when compared to the
control group. It identiﬁed that those supplemented with
vitamin B showed a reduction in atrophy of the critical
regions identiﬁed in patients with AD including the bilateral
hippocampus,
parahippocampal
gyrus,
retrosplenial
precuneus, lingual and fusiform gyrus, as well as the
cerebellum. They also found that higher levels of total
plasma homocysteine correlated with greater gray matter
atrophy in those who were not vitamin B supplemented.
This study was one of the few that used neuroimaging to
assess the response of B vitamin supplementation [51].
Ford et al. [54] is another randomized control trial sought
to identify the effect of 6 months of high-dose vitamin B
supplementation on oxidative stress and inﬂammation.
These included measurements of the vitamins, total plasma
homocysteine, and importantly molecules involved in
metabolism of substances that contribute to oxidative stress:
N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, creatine, myo-inositol,
and glutamate/glutamine. NAA, involved in myelination and
metabolism of harmful oxidants, and choline, involved in
cell membrane metabolism and indicate cell turnover and
growth, were used to signify levels of oxidative stress
[55e57]. With supplementation these biomarkers were seen
to improve, including a reduction in total plasma homo-
cysteine. Supplementation also increased the concentration
of NAA when the concentration of plasma vitamin B6 and
B12 increased. Vitamin B6 and B12 were also noted to
decrease plasma homocysteine more effectively than folate.
These ﬁndings highlight that high-dose vitamin B supple-
mentation has some role in reducing oxidative stress through
increasing their metabolism [54]. This may potentially
improve cellular growth and repair, myelination, and have a
long-term effect on brain health and reduction in rates of
cognitive decline. Flitton et al. [58] further highlighted a
genetic component may also inﬂuence cognitive decline by
analysis subsets of the VITACOG study [32] and TwinsUK
cohort and ﬁnding that vitamin B supplementation improved

atrophy in particular genetic variants of DNMT3L adding
yet another layer of complexity to the hypothesis. MCI,
which is well known to be a prodromal stage of AD, is
diagnosed in those with memory deﬁcits which are more
pronounced that in age-matched controls. They also have
visuospatial associative memory deﬁcits, a characteristic
feature of early hippocampal malfunction. Those with early
MCI also had high total plasma homocysteine [58].
While many trials found positive outcomes of supple-
mentation, the predominant body of evidence is still incon-
clusive. Livingstone et al. [59] highlighted two randomized,
placebo-controlledstudies[60,61]thathighlighted,albeitover
a short follow-up of 6 months, that vitamin B6, folate, B12
supplementation did not affect global cognition or immediate
memory capacity. A literature review of the effect of B12
deﬁciency on onset of dementia from a total of 18 studies
found low level evidence that elevated plasma homocysteine
levels may be correlated with earlier onset of dementia [62].
However there were numerous factors which may also
contribute to this ﬁnding, including the concurrent presence of
renal impairment, diabetes mellitus in these groups increasing
the risk of vascular dementia. The study went on to investigate
the effectiveness of B12 supplementation in dementia and
cognitive decline. Most studies reviewed had poor follow-up
periods, far shorter than the periods required to assess minute
cognitive changes, which can be upwards of 1.5 years. One
randomized control trial found brain atrophy was slowed with
vitamin B supplementation, only in those with MCI. Overall
there was a poor level of evidence indicating any positive
effect of supplementation in short-term cognitive function
[62]. Oral vitamin B12 is noted to be as effective as parenteral
B12 in various national recommendations, such as the British
Columbia Guidelines [63].
Ting et al. [64] was a substudy of the VITATOPS [65]
trial, which assessed the effect of long-term vitamin B
supplementation on cognition. The VITATOPS trial failed to
demonstrate any positive correlation between vitamin B6,
folate, and B12 supplementation and reduction in vascular
events and global cognitive decline on MMSE testing. This
study focused on patients on supplementation in the
VITATOPS study with lacunar stroke and subsequent
cognitive impairment, who did not have a diagnosis of de-
mentia. The study conducted further intensive neurophysi-
ological testing than an MMSE alone, assessing executive
function and attention with a 5-year follow-up period. They
found that the treatment arm had a lower total plasma
homocysteine but had no effect on their neurophysiological
parameters. They concluded that there were no clear effects
of B vitamin supplementation in improving global and
frontal cortical function in those patients with cognitive
impairment resulting from small vessel disease [64].
Lastly, Visioli et al. [66] also highlight that the large
body of clinical trials were inconclusive in correlating the
reduction of plasma homocysteine levels through vitamin
B12 supplementation to any functional effect on cognitive
impairment and dementia. Similar trials on folic acid had
minimal effects. They also hypothesize the discrepancy to
be a result of short treatment duration, poor period of
follow-up, as well as the large length of time required to
observe any discernible impact of degenerative processes
on cognition. Further trials would require individuals with
severe vitamin B deﬁciencies and treatment with high-dose
supplementation. Special care must be exercised in the
elderly who are at risk of acquired vitamin B12 deﬁciency

therefore,
appropriate
monitoring of vitamin B12 absorption, among a host of
other criteria as discussed, is essential for any future study

Alzheimer’s disease and the effect of
vitamin B6, folate, and B12
AD is devastating for individuals and their relatives, as well
as its burden on healthcare. The very nature of the disease is
a progressive deterioration, through stages of cognitive
decline and memory loss, eventually culminating in loss of
independence, frailty, and death. Various factors can
inﬂuence the development of cognitive decline, including
smoking,
poor
nutrition,

lifestyle.
discussed,
homocysteine
hypothesis presents an avenue of research by which
prevention therapy may be sought. However, conclusive
data has thus been scarce in terms of implementing the use
of vitamin B6, folate, and B12 in prevention or treatment of
this debilitating form of dementia.
Bhatti et al. [2] highlighted how high plasma homo-
cysteine may play a role in worsening oxidative stressors
commonly linked to progression of AD. Furthermore,
Douaud et al. [51] assessed the regions commonly affected
in the brain in AD and found increased rates of gray matter
atrophy in those with high homocysteine levels, as well as a
reduction in the rates of atrophy if these individuals were
supplemented by B vitamins. Raﬁee et al. [42] showed how
vitamin B12 deﬁciency results in the inactivation of PP2A,
which contributes to increased aggregation of tau proteins,
a hallmark of AD. Smith and Refsum [20] provide further
explanation that elevated plasma homocysteine can act as a
predictor of cognitive decline and early onset dementia. M.
S. Morris [69] highlights the large body of international
trials linking high plasma homocysteine to risk of dementia
and AD, including folate deﬁciencies as one of the most
signiﬁcant correlating factors for development of dementia.
Despite a reasonable body of evidence showing a
possible link between elevated plasma homocysteine,
B vitamin deﬁciencies, and the onset or rate of cognitive
decline and development of dementia, including AD, the
curative properties of this form of supplementation remain

unclear. Use of this form of supplementation may be better
aimed at prevention rather than cure, as the current body of
evidence would suggest. This is reﬂected by Lefevre et al.
[37], who refer to the large FACIT [49] and VITACOG
[32] trials that found a positive effect of folate supple-
mentation on rates of cognitive decline and brain atrophy.
Treatment of those with identiﬁable deﬁciencies in vitamin
B6/folate and B12 or those with high total plasma homo-
cysteine usually has some discernible beneﬁt in slowing
cognitive decline [26,33,54]. However, this is commonly to
prevent progression to MCI or AD in healthy individuals
rather than improve symptoms and signs already with the
disease. Trials, such as FACIT, have shown that vitamin B
supplementation may only slow the degenerative process in
AD, provided they have elevated levels of plasma homo-
cysteine. Thereafter, large systematic reviews, such as by
Rutjes et al. [70] go on to ﬁnd minimal evidence of any
reduction in rates of cognitive decline or dementia with
vitamin B supplementation. Lefèvre-Arbogast et al. [37]
further refers to various epidemiological studies ﬁnding
conﬂicting conclusions, from a beneﬁcial effect of high
dietary B vitamin intake on the risk of developing dementia
to possible harmful effects of folate supplementation
at high levels on cognitive function with vitamin B12
deﬁciencies [71e73].
The inconclusive evidence, and large gaps present, not
only stem from the incomplete understanding of vitamin B
deﬁciency and its links to dementia and cognitive decline,
but the study designs used to date. As Rutjes et al. [70] and
other studies have emphasized, most trials have had poor
follow-up periods to assess miniscule progressive changes
in cognitive function. They have often had poor power, due
to small sample sizes, or their sample size did not encom-
pass those with identiﬁable vitamin B deﬁciencies [26], and
hence were investigating vitamin B replete individuals in a
study assessing the beneﬁts of supplementation. The
assessment of participants is also brought into question by
M. S. Morris [69]. Cognitive testing is frequently through
the MMSE, which requires a long follow-up period or rapid
cognitive decline to appreciate any change. Early stage
cognitive impairment is better investigated in a shorter time
frame using neuropsychological test batteries; however,
there is no internationally accepted gold standard test
[74,75]. Douaud et al. [51] also presents an example of a
study where use of adjunct imaging to assess cortical
anatomy provided signiﬁcantly better outcomes from which
to draw conclusions.
Table 26.1 summarizes some of the relevant studies
discussed in the chapter.
Clinical recommendations and
application
As clinicians our role is to balance the risks and beneﬁts of
evidence-based therapy to avoid harm where possible and
achieve an optimal outcome. Given the current body of
evidence, the routine use of B vitamin supplementation is
not recommended in the existing clinical guidelines for
treatment of dementia in Australia. The current recom-
mendation is to supplement an identiﬁed deﬁciency on
serum biomarkers in those diagnosed with dementia [76].
The existing evidence also suggests that B vitamin
supplementation may be beneﬁcial in the prevention of
dementia through the slowing of cognitive decline to MCI
and dementia. Smith et al. [20] emphasize the relevance of
elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations in cognitive
decline and dementia. Lowering total plasma homocyste-
ine, using supplementation and other systemic measures,
such as folic acid food fortiﬁcation, can potentially prevent
progression to MCI and dementia in those aged above 60.
Routine screening for B vitamin deﬁciencies and elevated
plasma homocysteine in the older population are measures
to identify those at risk of developing cognitive decline and
dementia, with these individuals being ideal candidates for
B vitamin supplementation [20].
B vitamins may prove to be an important factor in our
struggle to manage the growing burden of an aging popu-
lation, with all the medical comorbidities that follow. While
large clinical trials such as VITACOG and FACIT show
positive evidence of a beneﬁcial effect of B vitamin
supplementation on cognitive decline and dementia, smaller
studies and research have been conﬂicting. While routine
vitamin B supplementation is not currently recommended in
national clinical practice guidelines for older populations,
the evidence increasingly suggests their use in B vitamin-
deﬁcient individuals would slow cognitive decline and the
degenerative process into dementia. With the larger focus on
their preventative merit, future studies are required to better
understand the nature of the homocysteine hypothesis.
These include larger national clinical trials, with longer
follow-up periods, more extensive participant testing, and
examination to clearly identify those with B vitamin
deﬁciencies. Further research into supplementation in those
already with diagnoses of AD is required before any
conclusion can be drawn as to its treatment potential in this
devastating disease.

Moderate quality evidencedoral B12 supplementation is as effective as parenteral B12.
Raﬁee et al. [62]
dlaboratory analysis
Vitamin B12 inhibits aggregation of tau proteins which are commonly linked to cerebral
pathology in AD. This may serve as a protective factor against development of neuronal
degeneration. No speciﬁc recommendations are made.
Smith et al. [32]
dRCT (VITACOG)
Treatment with vitamin B supplementation slowed rates of brain atrophy in those
with MCI.
Durga et al. [49]
dRCT (FACIT)
Folic acid supplementation is better than a placebo and is linked to improved memory,
information processing speed, and sensorimotor speed and reduction in total plasma
homocysteine. Supplementation may be effective in slowing age-relative cognitive decline.
Douaud et al. [51]dRCT
Vitamin B supplementation slows brain atrophy is regions linked to development and
pathology in AD.
No recommendations regarding routine use of supplementation.
Ford et al. [54]
dRCT
Vitamin B6 and B12 supplementation contributes to reduction in plasma homocysteine
and reduction in plasma markers of oxidative stress. Folate supplementation has no
signiﬁcant effect.
Nuru et al. [41]

Neurological diseases are the second leading cause of
deaths worldwide. The burden of neurodegenerative dis-
eases of the brain is increasing worldwide. Prevalence of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are more prominent
among other neurodegenerative diseases. AD represents
60%e80% of all dementia cases. About 43.8 million peo-
ple had dementia in 2016, and it was more than two times
compared to the incidence in 1990 (20.2 million) [1]. PD is
the fastest growing disease of all neurological disorders.
Recent data revealed that the number of patients with PD
was doubled from 1990 (2.5 million) to 2016 (6.1 million).
Globally, 0.33 million people were suffering from motor
neuron diseases and caused 34,325 deaths in 2016 [2].

in disease modiﬁcation has gained keen interest in the
failure of available management. Knowledge and experi-
ences of traditional medical practitioners worldwide are
important in ﬁnding more successful solutions to achieve
the health challenges. The most common Sri Lankan
medicinal herbs used in the management of neurodegen-
erative disease are brieﬂy discussed in this chapter.
Neurodegenerative disorders characterized by dementia,
cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, and motor-sensory
deﬁcits have resulted from progressive loss of functions
of neurons in related anatomical sites of the brain. Neuro-
degenerative disorders are classiﬁed on the basis of

types of neurodegeneration. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,

opathy. Lewy body disorders and multiple system atrophy
are categorized under synucleinopathies. Frontotemporal
lobar degeneration, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive
muscular atrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis come
under the TDP-43 proteinopathies [3]. Among these
diseases,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob
GerstmanneSträusslereScheinker disease, and familial
British dementia, or prion diseases are very rare in Sri
Lanka, except few reported cases.
AD, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by decline
in memory, thinking, behavioral and social skills leading to
inability of acting independently, is a progressive disorder,
in which the brain cells become weak, waste, and ﬁnally
die. Memory impairment is the key and early symptom of
the disease. Everyone may have experienced an infrequent
memory loss in life but in AD, it is progressive, persistent,
and become worse with the time. Patients with AD may be
aware of having certain difﬁculty in remembering things at
the early stage of the disease. Family members, friends, and
colleagues may notice this unusual situation when dealing
with the patient. Patient repeats statements and questions
over and over. Forgetfulness of conversations, appoint-
ments, events, familiar names, and places create difﬁculties
in managing routine works. With the advancement of the
disease, patient shows inability to select appropriate words
to communicate effectively with persons and to express his
thoughts correctly. Difﬁculties in concentrating, thinking,
reasoning, making judgment and decision are other com-
mon characteristic features of the disease. Failure to
manage ﬁnancial activities, to perform appropriate actions
in familiar tasks at home or work place are found at the later
stages of the disease. Eventually, patients exhibit changes
in personality and behavior, which include depressive
mood, apathy, social withdrawal, suspicions of others,
irritability, and aggressiveness. At the last stages of the
disease, patients are affected with difﬁculties of swallow-
ing, bowel and bladder control, resulting in malnutrition
and dehydration.
Neural amyloidosis is the main pathological change of
AD. Amyloids are insoluble ﬁbrous proteins. Aggregation
of amyloid ﬁlaments in the cytoplasm of neuron and glia,
and extracellular deposition of amyloids as plaques within
the parenchyma of the brain and walls of blood vessels
(amyloid angiopathy) contribute for the pathogenesis. Wide
range of morphological variations of amyloid plaques as
diffuse, dense-cored, cotton wool, and classical have been
identiﬁed [4]. b-amyloid (Ab) is the most common pro-
teolytic product of its precursor protein encoded by a gene
on chromosome 21 [5]. Tauopathy, accumulation of tau
protein in neuron and glia, is another pathological reason
for AD.
AD is associated with many risk factors. Age, family
history, genetic susceptibility, head trauma, poor sleep
pattern, and lifestyle have been identiﬁed as most inﬂuen-
tial risk factors. Prevalence of AD increases with the
increase of age. It is evident that two cases of AD per 1000
people aged between 65 and 74 years, 11 cases per
1000 people aged between 75 and 84, and 34 cases per
1000 people aged 80 years and above have been reported.
Apolipoprotien E e4 gene is identiﬁed as to increases the
risk of AD. AD associated with down syndrome exhibits
symptoms and sings 10e20 years earlier compared to other
patients. Staying asleep has shown an association with
increased incidence of AD. Lifestyle abnormalities such as
lack of exercise; uncontrolled food habits; and smoking
leading to increased risk of heart diseases, hypertension,
type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and obesity
increase the risk of AD.
Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s Disease, named after Dr. James Parkinson, a
progressive neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by
disorders of movement. PD greatly affects the quality of
life of the patient and demands support of attentive care-
givers. Pathologically aggregation of tau or neuroﬁbrillary
tangles in neurons is a hallmark of PD. Tau protein, which
is a member of the microtubule-associated protein family, is
regulated by microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)
gene located on chromosome 17. Tau protein is widely
distributed in neurons and plays a major role in stabilizing
microtubules. It regulates axonal transport. In pathological
states, tau protein becomes misfolded due to changes in
phosphorylation pattern causing damages to neurons and
axonal transport.

PD starts with tremor, slowed movements, and rigidity of
muscles. With the advancement of the disease, patients may
have impaired posture, balance, speech, and automatic
movements such as blinking, smiling, swinging of hands on
walking. These motor deﬁcits are largely attributed to the
progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra pars compacta (SNc) and presence of Lewy bodies and
Lewy neurites. In addition to the impairments of motor
functions, it accompanies various nonmotor symptoms
including sensory symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms,
and autonomic symptoms. Decline in the sensation of smell
and taste is more prominent. Cognitive dysfunctions, mem-
ory
loss,
depression,
anxiety,
apathy,
hallucinations,
delusions, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness are found as
neuropsychiatric disturbances. Autonomic symptoms of PD
salivation,
dysphagia,
constipation,
nocturia,
urgency
urinate,
excessive
sweating,
sexual
dysfunction [6].
Various abnormalities involved in different parts of the
brain and neuronal pathways are responsible for diverse
clinical manifestations of PD. Dopaminergic pathway
abnormalities in frontal striatum are associated with exec-
utive dysfunctions, which are manifested as deﬁcits in
ﬂexibility, planning, working memory, and reinforcement
learning.
Syndrome of dementia in PD might be due to the
nondopaminergic
cholinergic
dysfunctions.
Emotional disturbances including anxiety and depression are
probably due to the abnormal biochemical mechanisms
related to serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in limbic
system. Prolonged sleep disturbances including daytime
sleepiness and drowsiness may be due to the damage of
nuclei pontis, locus ceruleus, and corpora rubrum. Decline in
smell sensation, an earliest symptom of PD, may be due to
the involvement of brain region related to olfaction.
Neuropharmacological and rehabilitation approaches would
be beneﬁcial in the management of motor and nonmotor
deﬁcits of PD [6].
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is pathologically
characterized by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated
tau proteins in brain tissues, is not an uncommon neurode-
generative disorder associated with exposure to repeated
head injury especially in military and sports populations.
Gross pathological changes of the brain in chronic traumatic
encephalopathy include decreased weight of brain, thinning
of corpus callosum, mild enlargement of frontal and
temporal horns of lateral and third ventricles, gray and white
matter atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes; formation of
fenestrated cavities; atrophy of thalamus, hypothalamus,
and mammillary bodies; pallor of locus coeruleus and
substantia nigra. Deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau
protein (p-tau) as neuroﬁbrillary tangles, neuropil threads,
and astrocytic tangles in diencephalon, brainstem, and
cerebellum are the microscopic changes found in chronic
traumatic encephalopathy. The severity of changes is
categorized into stage IeIV on the basis of location, pattern,
and progression of tau accumulation. Widespread TDP-43
proteinopathy, deposition of beta-amyloid peptides, and
genetic susceptibility for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and
environmental factors also contribute for the pathogenesis
and progression of the disease.
Chronic traumatic brain injuries caused by external
force may lead to permanent or temporary impairments of

Patients with mild brain concussion may show diverse

common features of traumatic brain injury during ﬁrst

cognitive impairments due to neurodegenerative changes
at later stages of the life [8,9]. Increased impulsivity,
explosivity, violence, rage, depression, apathy, substance
abuse, and suicidal behavior are prominent as neuropsy-
chiatric
impairments.
impairments
attention deﬁcit, executive function deﬁcits, and memory
loss. Dysphagia, dysarthria, ataxia, and symptoms of
Parkinsonism appear as motor impairments.
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is associated with TDP-
43 proteinopathy. Varied clinical presentations including
abnormalities
progressive
agrammatic
aphasia have been reported. Pathologically frontal and
temporal neocortical atrophy, neostriatal atrophy, and
depigmentation of substantia nigra have been identiﬁed in
this condition. Neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic
neuritis, and neuronal intranuclear inclusion of TDP-43
protein have been detected microscopically.
Primary lateral sclerosis

encompasses
primary
lateral sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive
muscular atrophy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, pro-

spinobulbar muscular atrophy and post-polio syndrome.
Anatomically, cell bodies of upper motor neurons (second
order motor neurons) reside in the precentral gyrus or
primary motor cortex of the brain. Third or higher-order
motor neurons are located in the prefrontal cortex of the
frontal lobes. These neurons are involved in planning and

organizing the motor activities and directing the second-
order neurons. In primary lateral sclerosis, second-order
upper motor neurons are affected while both upper and
lower motor neurons are affected in ALS. Primary
muscular atrophy and spinal muscular atrophy are asso-
ciated with lower motor neuron only. Within the scope of
“Brain Health” primary lateral sclerosis and ALS are
emphasized here.
Primary lateral sclerosis, the most common form of
motor neuron disease, is characterized by progressive
spasticity or stiffness of upper and lower extremities,
trunk, and bulbar muscles. Clinically, primary lateral
sclerosis presents with gradual-onset, asymmetrical pro-
gressive stiffness of lower limbs, and pain due to spas-
ticity.
Sometimes

Abnormalities of TDP-43 protein are the responsible
factors in primary lateral sclerosis. TDP-43, which is a
nuclear protein, forms inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm,

generative

degeneration, ALS, and AD.
Both upper and lower motor neurons are affected in ALS.
Clinically, it presents with weakness of lower and upper
limbs, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations and spasticity.
Macroscopically, degenerative changes can be seen in
motor cortex, spinal cord, and anterior spinal nerve roots.
Patients with dementia have focal atrophy of temporal and
frontal lobes of the brain. Neuronal loss and gliosis affect
the lower motor neuron of the spinal cord and brain stem
and upper motor neuron in motor cortex. Sometimes the
disease can spread to other sites of the brain including
hippocampus and amygdala.
Herbal medicines that could be
recommended for the
History of herbal medicine or traditional medicine in Sri
Lanka dates back to ancient civilizations. Evolution and
propagation of Ayurveda, which originated in India,
contributed for the systematic development of indigenous
practices of medicine in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka possesses
huge treasury of medicinal plants and invaluable herbal
formulations recorded in palmyra leaf manuscripts in
addition to the formulations derived from Ayurveda system
of medicine. Almost all formulations are to be scientiﬁcally
validated for their effects and efﬁcacy, even though tradi-
tional medicinal practitioners have promising experiences
and evidences of these formulations. Some formulations are
being kept as secrets among the practitioners as a traditional
intellectual wealth of the country.
In Ayurveda system of medicine, a large number of
herbal formulations that could be recommended for the
management of neurodegenerative diseases have been
mentioned along with special administrative procedures in
authentic classical textbooks of pharmacotherapeutics.
Bhaishajjya Rathnavali, and Yogarathnakara are the most
renowned treaties of pharmacotherapeutics. Great physi-
cians of Ayurveda have recommended various forms of
Rasayana procedures for the management of degenerative
disorders with the intention of improving cognitive,
behavioral, motor, and sensory impairments associated
with brain diseases. Indrokta Rasayanaya, Medhakara
Rasayanaya, Aindri Rasayanaya, Amalakayasa Brahma
Rasayanaya, Cyavanaprasa Rasayanaya, and Amalaki
Rasayanaya have been emphasized for their beneﬁts in
improving the clinical conditions associated with neuro-
degeneration.
Apart

various
dosage forms such as powders, pills, decoctions, medi-
cated oils, and medicated ghees have been mentioned in
Ayurveda Pharmacopoeia of Sri Lanka. Sarasvatha curna,

patients in absence of effective therapy. Many fundamental
pathological processes such as oxidative stress, proteotoxic
stress, apoptosis, formation of abnormal protein inclusions,
and neuroinﬂammation are involved in initiation and
progression of neurodegenerative diseases [11]. Neuro-
inﬂammation may be the central mechanism, which acts as a
vicious circle in association with other pathological pro-
cesses. Altered functions of immune system, formation of
inﬂammatory chemicals, overstimulation or inhibition of
receptors can disturb the homeostasis of brain tissues.
Prevention of inﬂammatory reaction, modulation of immune
mechanisms, inhibitions of abnormal protein synthesis, and
aggregation may be useful in the management of neurode-
generative diseases. Modern scientiﬁc evidences and ancient
clinical experiences support the signiﬁcance of natural
combination of phytochemicals for the prevention and con-
trol of neurodegenerative diseases.
Phenolic and polyphenolic substances of food and
medicinal plants are reported to have antioxidative and
antiinﬂammatory
properties.
Abnormally
upregulated
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthetase
(iNOS) play a major role in inﬂammatory processes.
Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) regulates the expression
of COX-2 and iNOS. Wide array of phytochemicals such
as resveratrol, anthocyanins, and curcumin have shown
signiﬁcant effects on inhibiting the NF-kB activation [12].
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and reactive
nitrogen species is responsible for pathogenesis of many
diseases. Vegetables, fruits, and medicinal plants are reported
to have antioxidative phytochemicals. They have shown
greater therapeutic value in controlling the oxidative stresses
mediated through inhibition of oxidative enzymes and pro-
motion of free radical scavenging activities. Tannins, ﬂa-
vones, triterpenoids, steroids, saponins, and alkaloids present
in medicinal plants contribute to the control of oxidative
reactions [13]. Aging is a common risk factor in neurode-
generative diseases. Antiaging properties of phytochemical
mediated via antioxidant activity is well established.

of NF-kB. Proanthocyanidins, curcumin, and resveratrol are
reported to improve cognitive decline and depression by
modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, seroto-
nergic transmission and hippocampal neurogenesis [14].
Natural phytochemicals derived from medicinal plants are
very important in managing age-related diseases and they

age-
associated inﬂammations, and oxidative stress. Flavonoids
have shown favorable effects in reducing oxidative stress and

Review on medicinal herbs used for the
management of neurodegenerative
diseases of the brain
Gotu koladCentella asiatica (Linn)
Urbd(Apiaceae)
Gotu kola, Sri Lankan Sinhala name for C. asiatica, is a
well-known herb used in both medicinal and culinary
practices of many countries. The history of traditional uses
of C. asiatica d(Gotu kola) for medicinal purposes runs
back to thousands of years in Asia. Ayurveda, Sri Lankan
Traditional Medicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine
use C. asiatica internally and externally for curing many
disorders such as skin diseases, leprosy, lupus, varicose
ulcers, eczema, psoriasis, diarrhea, fever, amenorrhea,
diseases of the female genitourinary tract, and also for
relieving anxiety and improving cognition [15]. C. asiatica
is an important ingredient of herbal formulations trans-
mitted generation to generation in Sri Lankan traditional
medical practice. In Ayurveda, it is indicated in the treat-
ment of mental disorders as a brain tonic and memory
enhancer because of the properties of improving cognitive
functions of the brain. In Sri Lankan system of traditional
medicine, C. asiatica is included in many herbal formula-
tions recommended for the management of neurodegener-
ative diseases. Siddhajeevamrutha, a herbal syrup, prepared
by using the decoction derived from C. asiatica (whole
plant), W. somnifera (root), G. glabra, M. pruriens (seed),
A. adscendens (root), and juice of A. racemosa (root) is a
renowned medicine indicated as a powerful treatment for
diseases characterized by cognitive and memory deﬁcit.
Another herbal preparation, which is prepared by boiling
C. asiatica (whole plant) in cow’s milk, bears similar
signiﬁcance in the management of epilepsy and neurode-
generative conditions. Dried powder of C. asiatica is
administered orally with cow’s milk for the same purposes
[10]. Scientiﬁc studies have provided sufﬁcient evidence to
prove the role of C. asiatica in these invaluable formula-
tions and its effect and efﬁcacy in the management of
neurodegenerative diseases.
The cholinergic hypothesis has been argued extensively
in the pathogenesis of AD and its management. Depletion
of the cholinergic neurotransmission in cerebral cortex and
other areas due to degeneration of cholinergic neurons in
basal forebrain has been identiﬁed as a contributory factor
for the deterioration of cognitive functions in patients with
AD [16]. C. asiatica extract is reported to have potential

improving
hippocampus-dependent
learning and memory in a dose-dependent manner in rats
through increased expression of the AMPA GluA1 receptor
in the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus [17].
C. asiatica is reported to have activities mediated through
acetylcholinesterase
improving
neuron
morphology of hippocampus and enhancing the higher
brain function when treated during postnatal period of rats
[18]. A metaanalysis reveals that C. asiatica is effective in
improving working memory. In combination with other
medicinal plants, as herbal formulations, it improves the
attention, concentration, executive function, and informa-
tion processing speed [19].
Another hypothesis in the pathogenesis of AD is the
neuronal damage due to deposition of beta-amyloids (Ab)
in brain tissues. It has been suggested that oxidative
reactions are responsible for the promotion of inﬂammatory
reaction, lipid peroxidation, and beta-amyloid (Ab) plaque
formation in the brain. Antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory
activities of C. asiatica have been studied in the prevention
of neurotoxicity and promotion of the neuroregeneration in
animal models extensively. Activation and promotion of
secretase pathway and other enzyme pathways may also
contribute to the degradation of formed beta-amyloid pla-
ques in AD. Inhibitory activity of C. asiatica water extract
on phospholipase A2 enzyme, specially cPLA2 and sPLA2,
has been attributed in the prevention of neurotoxicity [20].
C. asiatica is reported to have beneﬁcial effects in the
management of PD, a neurodegenerative condition associ-
ated with the degradation of dopaminergic neurons of basal
ganglia.
Lunuvila (B. monnieridfamily:
Scropulariaceae)
B. monnieri (Lunuvila in Sri Lankan Sinhala; Brahmi in
Sanskrit), a very popular medicinal plant in Sri Lankan
traditional medical practice, can be found abundantly in
coastal areas of the island and in marshy lands as well. It is
widely used as a component of both internal and external
herbal preparations recommended for the management of
many diseases including neurological diseases character-
ized by cognitive function deﬁcits, skin diseases associated
with immunological reactions, rheumatism, and infectious
diseases of the skin. About 146 species of Bacopa have
been identiﬁed from different regions of the world
including Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Taiwan, China, and
southern regions of United States [21]. In Ayurveda, it is
popular as a medicinal herb having the property of Medhya
(i.e., cognitive function enhancer) and is a component of
Medya Rasayana recommended for cognitive function
enhancement. Brahmi ghrita, an Ayurveda herbal prepa-
ration, prepared by using B. monnieri, Acorus calanus,
Saussurea lappa, and Convolvulus pluricaulis, is a very
famous medication for the management of brain diseases
including Unmada (psychiatric disorders) and Apasmara
(epilepsy).

B.
possesses
diverse
chemical
composition
consisting
bacosides, bacopasides, bacopasaponins, apigenin, cucurbi-
tacin, brahmine, monnierin, hersaponin, monnierasides,
d-mannitol, herpestin, and nicotine. Bacoside A has been
studied widely to elucidate the mechanism of B. monnieri in
the management and prevention of neurodegenerative
diseases. Bacosides, which are nonpolar glycosides, can
cross the blood-brain barrier via simple lipid-mediated
passive diffusion [22,23].
Neuroprotective mechanism of B. monnieri is mainly
discussed on the basis of antioxidant activity, inhibition of
acetylcholinesterase activity, promotion of choline acetyl-
transferase activity, antiinﬂammatory activity, intellectual
enhancing
beta-amyloid
reduction
neurotransmitter modulation activity, and cerebral blood
ﬂow enhancing activity [24].
Neurodegeneration in AD is associated with the activ-
ities of superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen
peroxide, and nitric oxide. Neuronal lesions can increase
the activity of microglia, and they further increase the
superoxide radical activity. Controlling of these oxidative
reactions is a therapeutic target in the prevention of AD.
Bacoside A, a chemical constituent of B. monnieri,
shows signiﬁcant effect in controlling the oxidative
reactions in the brain. Aqueous bacoside A increases the
brain glutathione level, vitamin A, C, and E in cigarette
smoke-treated animal models, in addition to the increase
of activities related to superoxide dismutase, catalase,
glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase [25] and
also it inhibits the lipid peroxidation while improving the
adenosine triphosphatase activity [26]. Bacopaside I,
another chemical constituent of B. monnieri, is potent
enough to reduce neurological deﬁcits and infarct volume,
while increasing brain ATP content, energy charge,

oxide
level,
Naþ Kþ ATPase
Ca2þMg2þATPase activity.
Adequate blood ﬂow is an essential factor for normal
function of any tissue. Diminished blood ﬂow results in
deﬁcits of oxygen and nutrition leading to degenerative
changes. Diminished cerebral blood ﬂow, caused by different
risk factors, can induce neurodegeneration. B. monnieri
increases the cerebral blood ﬂow via the mechanism
mediated in cerebrovascular dilatation.
Long-term neuroinﬂammation causes neurodegenera-
tive diseases including AD, PD, and multiple sclerosis.
Microglial cells and resident macrophages in the central
nervous system play a major role in the pathogenesis of
neuroinﬂammation. Activated microglia at the site of lesion

can transform either into neurotoxic phenotype (M1) or
neuroprotective phenotype (M2). Neurotoxic microglia
produces inﬂammatory cytokines, i.e., tumor necrosis.
Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-
6 (IL-6) whereas neuroprotective microglia secretes inter-
leukin 10 (IL-10), which is an antiinﬂammatory cytokine
acts against the M1 responses. Chronic inﬂammations of
the central nervous system can be resulted from the
defective mechanisms of both phenotypes of microglias
[27,28,29,30]. This type of neuroinﬂammation has been
found in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia too.
B. monnieri is an important therapeutic candidate, since it
has a favorable antineuroinﬂammatory activity. Recent
evidences on clinical trials with standardized extracts of
B. monnieri conﬁrm that it improves attention and language
skills (i.e., reading, writing, and comprehension skills);
orientation of time, place, and person; and other cognitive
functions.
The amygdala is involved in emotional responses, for-
mation of emotional memory, and long-term memory.
Cholinergic neurons projected to the amygdala play an
important role in memory acquisition [31]. Long-term
administration of B. monnieri extracts is reported to
produce structural changes in amygdaloid neurons by
exhibiting the increase of dendritic length and branching
points. These changes may provide opportunity for new
formation

impulses and enhancement of learning-memory processes.
B. monnieri extracts may release neuromodulators and alter
the activity of neurotransmitters that would be responsible
for enhancement of learning and memory.
Amukkarad(Withania somniferadfamily:
Solanaceae)
W. somnifera (Amukkara in Sinhala; Aswagandha in
Sanskrit) which is a renowned medicinal plant in the sys-
tem of Ayurveda, has drawn special attention among
scientists worldwide. W. somnifera root is mainly used in
the management of various diseases including neurological
disorders, genitourinary disorders, cardiovascular diseases,
immune-mediated disorders, and infertility. W. somnifera
root, which possesses useful properties to promote health,
longevity, and immunity, is included in the category of
rasayana drugs. W. somnifera root is used as a single drug
or as a combined ingredient with other herbal materials of
formulation in the management of cognitive and memory
impairments, epilepsy, PD, HD, AD, strokes, stress and
other diseases characterized by motor-sensory impairments.
In-vitro and in-vivo studies have been done to investigate
the potential pharmacological effects and their mechanisms.
Active principles of W. somnifera, which include sitoin-
dosides VIIeX and withaferin A are reported to have
putative nootropic activity mediated through the effects on
acetylcholine
concentration,
choline
acetyl
transferase
activity, muscarinic cholinergic binding activity in experi-
mentally
[32].
Glycowithanolides
W. somnifera reduce oxidative stress by normalizing the
elevated superoxide dismutate and lipid peroxidation
activity and increasing the activity of catalase [33]. An
animal study on chemically induced HD has shown
preventive effect against body weight reduction and
hypoactivity. Other studies have revealed that W. somnifera
is effective in reducing walking errors and gait abnormal-
ities in PD animal model, impaired locomotor activity in
diabetic mice, functional abnormalities of legs and foot
fault errors in middle cerebral artery occluded rats.
W. somnifera and withaferin A are reported to have anxi-
olytic activity. Special reference memory deﬁcits induced
by hypoxia, memory loss, and defective learning ability
have been improved in different experimental animal
models with the treatment of W. somnifera [34].
Brain oxidative stress increases the generation of reac-
tive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, hydrogen
peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. Reactive oxygen species
trigger the lipid peroxidation involving the cell membrane
lipids and cause neurodegenerative changes. W. somnifera
shows greater effect against the chemically induced
oxidative stresses on different parts of the brain. Decreased
superoxide dismutase activity, which causes neuropa-
thology in corpus striatum, has been improved with
W. somnifera treatment while increasing the catalase
activity and glutathione peroxidase activity and decreasing
the lipid peroxidation in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and
forebrain. Withaferin A can reduce the increased levels of
nitric oxide metabolites in brain tissues. Protein carbonyl
content is assessed to measure the excitotoxic neuronal
damages in experimental animal models. W. somnifera has
shown to have ameliorative effects by reducing the elevated
protein carbonyl contents in hippocampus and cerebral
cortex.
W. somnifera is beneﬁcial to correct and control
the neurodegenerative processes involved in chronic
brain diseases via the different mechanisms of actions.
W. somnifera can improve the clinical status of patients
with PD by increasing the dopamine receptor expression.
Stress and related pathologies are corrected by inhibiting
the glucocorticoid activity and increasing the serotonin
activity. Mitochondrial protection ability of W. somnifera
helps to control the progression of HD. Inhibition of
acetyl choline esterase and increasing of acetylcholine
receptor expression of W. somnifera are mediated in
controlling AD and cognitive impairments and ability to
increase the cyclic AMP level are important in preventing
cellular damages caused by cerebral ischemia. Many
other studies have exhibited calming effects on stress and
reversed memory loss [35]. Cholinergic activity
W. somnifera has been reported in a study done by [36].

Wanduru Me (Mucuna pruriens; family:
Fabaceae)
M. pruriens (Wanduru Me in Sinhala, Kapikacchu in
Sanskrit, velvet bean in English) is a popular herb in
Ayurveda and traditional systems of medicine in Sri Lanka.
Approximately 150 species of annual and perennial
legumes of genus Mucuna have been identiﬁed. Among
them M. pruriens is found in tropical and subtropical
regions of the world. The seeds of M. pruriens are widely
used as medicinal and food source because of their high
protein content and important phytochemical constituents
[39]. This plant has slender branches, alternate lanceolate
leaves, white ﬂowers with a bluish-purple colored corolla,
and thick hairy pods. Each pod may have 4e6 dark brown-
colored seeds.
In traditional practices of herbal medicine in India and
Sri Lanka, it is mainly used for the management of
neurological diseases, erectile dysfunctions [40], infertility,
arthritis, and scorpion stings [41].
M. pruriens has been extensively studied for its chemi-
cal and medicinal properties. More than 50 chemical con-
stituents have been identiﬁed from different parts of
M. pruriens. The seeds are reported to have diversiﬁed
nutritionally
pharmacologically
valued
chemical
constituents
proteins,
minerals,
(niacin, ascorbic acid), amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic
acid, serine, threonine, proline, alanine, glycine, valine,
cystine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenyl
alanine,
tryptophan,
lysine,
histidine,
arginine),
glutathione, lecithin, gallic acid, fatty acids (palmitic,
oleic, stearic, linoleic, linolenic, and behenic acid), beta
sitosterol [42]. Levodopa (L-dopa) is the pharmacologically
important chemical constituent mainly found in the seeds of
M. pruriens in addition to the presence of many more
constituents such as tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine,
mucunine,
mucunadine,
prurienine,
prurieninine
[43,44,45].
Effects and efﬁcacy of M. pruriens seeds have been
widely investigated in different animal models and in
clinical settings to validate the traditional uses in the
management of various diseases. It is reported to have
antioxidant, antiparkinsonian, antiepileptic, aphrodisiac,
antifertility,
antitumor,
antidiabetic,
antiinﬂammatory,
analgesic, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, and antivenomous
effects [39,44].
Signiﬁcance of M. pruriens seed in the treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases is well established. L-Dopa, a
precursor of dopamine that act as a neurotransmitter in
brain, plays a major role in the management of PD in
addition to the contribution of other constituents such as
genistein and polyunsaturated fatty acids of M. pruriens,
which improve the neuroprotective and antiparkinsonian
actions. Phytic acid suppresses the hydroxyl radical gen-
eration
promotes
[46].
M. pruriens seed extract with reduced L-dopa also shows
neuroprotective effects against PD by reducing hydrogen
peroxide-induced cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species
production, and nitric oxide species in experimental cells
[47]. An experimental study suggests beneﬁcial effects of
M. pruriens extract on rescuing motor, olfactory, mito-
chondrial, and synaptic impairment of PD [48]. Further,
ameliorative effect of M. pruriens mediated via NF-kB and
Akt pathways on neuroinﬂammatory process and capacity
to restore the biochemical and behavioral change may be
responsible to prevent the progression of PD.
M. pruriens has gained huge reputation as a natural
medicine because of its advantages over synthetic L-dopa
[49]. Synthetic L-dopa may produce adverse effects on
long-term administration to the PD patients. Chronic
treatment with levodopa in PD can cause drug-induced
dyskinesias,
motor
ﬂuctuations,
complications [50]. Administration of M. pruriens powder
improves the symptoms of PD with a more favorable
tolerability proﬁle and safety compared to conventional
synthetic L-dopa [51].
Depression is characterized by altered mood and
cognitive functions and recurrent thoughts of death or
suicide, which is due to the functional deﬁcit of mono-
amines (i.e., norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) at
responsible sites of the brain. Extract of M. pruriens seeds,
which have the potential effect to restore the endogenous
levodopa,
dopamine,
norepinephrine,
contents in substantia nigra, possesses an antidepression
activity mediated by interactions with dopaminergic
system [52].
Vishnukranti (Evolvulus alsinoides;
familydConvolvulaceae)
E. alsinoides (Vishnukranti in Sinhala and Sanskrit), a
pantropical perennial ﬂowering plant with a small slender
hairy stem, small elliptic apiculate leaves, blue colored
ﬂowers with broad funnel-shaped corolla, is found in many
tropical and warm temperate regions of Sri Lanka, India,


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 402

Australia, Polynesia, Africa, and America. E. alsinoides is
mainly used in Sri Lankan traditional system of medicine
for the management of diseases characterized by cognitive
impairments, memory deﬁcits, and also the management
of malarial fever. Roots and stem with leaves are used to
make a decoction that is used to treat dysentery, fever,
asthma,
depression,
forms
psychiatric
disorders [53]. This medicinal herb is used as a substitute
for Shankhpushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis) in Sri Lanka.
The chemical constituents of the plants include Scopole-
tin, Scopolin, Umbelliferone, butanetetrol, ferulic acid,
palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, kaempferol, and
glycopyranosides. E. alsinoides shows antistress, adapto-
genic, antiamnesic, antiulcer, anticatatonic, antioxidant,
gastroprotective,
immune-modulator
activities
experimental animal models. E. alsinoides possesses sig-
niﬁcant
mediated
increasing
enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and
glutathione activity while reducing lipid peroxidation.
Reduction of Inﬂammatory markers such as IL-1b, IL-6,
TNF-a in brain tissues may be responsible for the
correction of neuroinﬂammation. Further it can inhibit the
acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, which is beneﬁcial
in management of AD by improving cognitive and
memory deﬁcits [54].
Shankapushpi (C. pluricaulis) is mainly found in India
and is used as a nervine tonic for the improvement of
memory and cognitive functions. It is recommended for the
management of stress, anxiety, insomnia by regulating the
adrenalin and cortisol. Nootropic and memory enhancing
properties of shankapushi (C. pluricaulis) are attributed to
the pharmacological activities of its different phytochemical
constituents including glycosides, ﬂavonoids, coumarins,
anthocyanins, ,lkaloids, sitosterol glycoside, octacosanol
tetracosane, hydroxycinnamic acid, and glucose. It is
reported to have signiﬁcant effects on increasing the den-
dritic intersections, branch points, and dendritic processes of
neurons suggesting the prevention of neurodegenerative
diseases [55].

Nothing could be worse for a person who has spent a whole
life working toward the establishment of a healthy, happy,
and prosperous life for himself/herself and fellow beings,
and that all of a sudden, one day, discovers that he/she is
unable to identify his/her close relatives, including hus-
band/wife, son, daughter, and friends. Such possibilities are
not far away from reality. Many people display alarming
symptoms of the disease that usually result in the loss of
short-term memory and impairment of normal cognitive
behaviors, which render the individuals, socially hostile [1].
The advanced stages of the disease, in medical terms,
generally deﬁned as dementia [2], that possesses combi-
nation of pathological and psychosomatic symptoms,
which are generally found to be progressive in nature [3].
At this stage, people exclusively become dependent upon
the family members and caregivers for performing their
routine activities [4e6]. The disease begins with sequential
deterioration of cognitive function. In a broader sense,
dementia is usually diagnosed on the basis of disruption in
cognitive function, such as poor retention of short-term
memory, the inability of critical thinking, disorientation,
lack of comprehension, analytical calculation, trouble in
learning ability, language, and poor judgment [7e10].
However, despite all the deﬁcits, the consciousness remains
unaffected [11]. Although ageing is thought to be a major
risk factor for the commencement of dementia, the clinical
neurodegenerative syndromes characterized by impairment
of cognitive functions and memory are also evident in early
age [12e14]. Dementia is also prevalent in the populations
suffering from chronic diseases such as stroke [15] and
multiple sclerosis [16]. On the pathological basis, symp-
toms and disease outcomes, dementia can be classiﬁed into
several categories, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) type
[17,18],
vascular
[7,14,19,20],
Lewy’s body dementia [8,21], etc. Among all the patho-
logical events known for causing dementia, AD is reported
to be the most common cause of dementia, which is char-
acterized by progressive loss of memory and other cogni-
tive deﬁcits, including an impaired sense of judgment and
deﬁcit in decision-making and language disturbances
[22e25]. Histochemically, the AD patients display an
accumulation of amyloid beta (Ab) peptides in different

dementia is generally originated from ischemic, hypo-
perfusive, or hemorrhagic brain lesions [20]. The other risk
factors identiﬁed for dementia includes physical and
cognitive inactivity [31], epigenetic and environmental
factors,
cerebrovascular
problems
[32e35], excessive alcohol consumption [23,36], social
isolation, traumatic brain injury [37e40], and presence of
multiple copies of APOEε4 genetic variants [41e43]. A
number of other critical illnesses, injuries, and environ-
mental factors are also responsible for the commencement
of dementia [44,45]. The disease can have distressing
consequences, not only for the people who suffer from
it but also for the families and caregivers. It has often
been observed that a lack of awareness and understanding
of the diseases leads to the development of a belief system
among the people to accept dementia as an outcome of
the normal ageing process. Such adaptation results in
stigmatization and offers hurdles to diagnosis and disease
management. The effect of the disease can have a physical,
psychological, social, and economic impact on the affected
family, medical personnel, and society at large [46]. AD is
the most common form of neurodegenerative diseases
and may contribute to 60%e70% of cases of dementia
[23,47]. The boundaries between different forms of de-
mentia are often blurry and mixed forms of the symptoms
frequently coexist. Worldwide, around 50 million people
suffer from dementia, with nearly 60% of them living in
low- and middle-income countries [48]. It is estimated
that nearly 5%e8% of the population aged 60 and over
suffer from dementia at a given time. The total number of
people living with dementia is anticipated to reach 82
million in 2030 and 152 million in 2050 [49]. It is also
speculated that the growth in the number of people with
dementia would be living in the low- and middle-income
countries. Furthermore, AD is also currently ranked as
the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.
A prediction suggests that more than 5.5 million Ameri-
cans, over the age 65, may develop dementia caused by
AD [11]. Although age is the commonly known risk
factor for dementia, ageing is not the exclusive conse-
quence of ageing. Further, dementia does not exclusively
affect only older people. Young-onset of dementia (that
occur before the age of 65 years) contributes up to 9% of
the total cases reported. Studies have revealed that the
risk of dementia might be substantially reduced by
getting
regular
exercise,
quitting
smoking,
avoiding
consumption of harmful levels of alcohol, controlling
weight, balanced diet, and maintaining healthy blood
pressure, increased cholesterol and blood sugar levels.
Other risk factors include pre-existing depression, low
educational background, social isolation, and cognitive
inactivity.
Alzheimer’s disease: the leading cause
of dementia
AD refers to an irreversible, progressive brain damage that
abolishes theability to retain short-term memory and learning
skills, which eventually results in the loss of ability to carry
out simple tasks. Normally, the symptoms of AD appear
initially in the mid-60s; however, it speculated that changes
in the brain might begin well in advance, maybe a decade or
more before the mature symptoms get surfaced and the in-
dividual is labeled as AD patient [50]. The preclinical stage
of AD often seems to be symptom-free, however, the major
neurodegenerative events occur in the brain tissue long
before the ﬁrst symptom appears [51]. Abnormal deposition
of peptides/proteins form amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbril-
lary tangles throughout the brain, which usually results in a
reduction in the number of functional neurons [52], [53e55].
Once the healthy neurons stop functioning, they lose con-
nections with other neurons, and subsequently become iso-
lated and die. Many other complex changes in brain tissues
are thought to play a role in AD, too. The prominent dam-
ages take place in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cor-
tex, which is known to play an essential role in forming
memories. Due to the progressive death of neurons, other
parts of the brain are affected and begin to shrink. At the
ﬁnal stage of the diseases, the damage in the nervous tissues
becomes widespread, and the brain shrinks signiﬁcantly.
Signs and symptoms of AD
Memory deﬁcit typically represents one of the ﬁrst signs of
cognitive impairment related to commencement of AD.
Initially, the AD patients develop problems related to
inability to recollect recent events, which is commonly
referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [56]. In
MCI, people have more memory problems, however,
appearance of symptoms do not interfere with their
everyday lives. Difﬁculties in movement and problems with
the sense of smell are also found to be affected during MCI
[24]. Generally, older people with MCI are at greater risk
for developing AD. Some patients, even without any
medical intervention, revert back to normal cognition. The
initial symptoms of AD are reported to vary from person to
person. Researchers have been trying to discover bio-
markers (found in brain images, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, and
blood) in synergy with MCI to detect early changes in the
brains of people. Studies indicate that such early detection
is possible, but more research is needed to authenticate
these techniques that can be used routinely to diagnose AD
in routine medical practices. Again, depending upon the
severity, the AD can further be classiﬁed as; mild, mod-
erate, and severe AD [57]. As the disease progresses, the

patients experience greater memory loss and other cogni-
tive difﬁculties [58]. Problems include aimless wandering
and getting lost, trouble in handling money and paying
bills, asking the same question repeatedly, taking a long
time to complete normal routine tasks, and overall change
in personality and behavior. People are often diagnosed in
this stage. In the case of moderate AD, damage occurs in
areas
hamper
linguistic
integrity,
reasoning, sensory processing, and conscious thought. The
situation becomes progressively worse, and this is the state
when people begin to develop problems in identifying
family members and friends. The patient often faces difﬁ-
culty in learning new things, carrying out a simple task in
multiple steps, and unable to cope up with new situations.
In addition, patients at this stage also have hallucinations,
delusions, and paranoia, and may behave impulsively. If
the patient remains untreated at this stage, the cognitive
activities are likely to get deteriorated. The brain tissue
shrinks signiﬁcantly. Patients at this would be unable to
communicate and would be entirely dependent on care
takers. Near the end, the person may be in bed most or all
of the time as the body shuts down all the activities per-
taining to locomotion.
However, despite phenomenal progress in scientiﬁc
studies and the discovery of new knowledge about AD, the
scientiﬁc community has not yet fully understood the root
causes of the disease. It is evident that the early-onset of the
disease may arise due to occurrence of genetic mutations,
particularly in secretases and apolipoproteins genes [59,60].
Late-onset of the disease arises from a complex series of
changes in the brain tissues that occur over several years and
sometimes over decades [61]. The pathological causes most
likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and
lifestyle elements [62]. The importance of any one of these
factors (either in increasing or decreasing the risk of
developing AD) may differ from one person to another.
Understanding the origin of AD
Amyloid b (Ab) hypothesis
Scientists across the globe are steering their studies to learn
more about the origin and nature of amyloid plaques, tan-
gles, and other biological features of AD. For the ﬁrst time
in 1906, the symptoms and pathological signature of AD
were observed and reported by its discoverer Dr. Alois
Alzheimer [63]. In his observation, Dr. Alzheimer detected
considerable change in the brain tissues of his woman pa-
tient Augusta D., who had died due to an uncommon
mental illness. Her pathological symptoms included loss of
memory, problems in language perception, and inconsistent
behavior. After the death of the patient, he examined the
affected brain, and surprisingly observed many abnormal
clumps
(now
called
plaques)
deposited
intermittently with bundles of tangled ﬁbers (now called
neuroﬁbrillary, or Tau tangles). The presence of these pla-
ques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles in the brain tissues are still
considered to be essential features of AD. The amyloid
hypothesis argues that aggregation of amyloid b (Ab)
peptide into oligomers, protoﬁbrils, and ﬁbrils, and forma-
tion of neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmarks of AD
pathology [64e66]. Amyloid plaques are usually formed by
aggregation of 37e43 amino acid residues length peptides,
known as Ab peptides, which are produced by the proteo-
lytic breakdown of a membrane protein known as an Am-
yloid precursor protein (APP). The cellular function of APP
is largely unknown. The proteases that catalyze the break-
down of APP are named as a-, b- and ƴ-secretases [64,65].
As depicted in Fig. 28.1, the turnover of APP and the
formation of toxic Ab peptides are dependent upon the
relative abundance and selective catalytic activity of a-, b-
and ƴ-secretases. Preferential action of b- and ƴ-secretases
leads to the formation of highly aggregation-prone Ab
peptides that tend to undergo intermolecular interaction and
form soluble and insoluble aggregates. However, the action
of a-secretase abolishes the aggregation potential of the
resulting peptides and hence amyloid formation does not
take place. The newly formed Ab peptides (after the action
of b- and ƴ-secretases) undergo a drastic structural transi-
tion from unstructured peptide monomer to discreet oligo-
meric or polymeric structures rich cross b-sheets [67]. The
formation of b-sheet-rich amyloid aggregates is a multi-
factorial process, and the resulting aggregates display
conformation-dependent
neurotoxicity,
[64,67].
brain, Ab peptides usually exist in three major conforma-
tions; monomeric, oligomeric, and ﬁbrillar. Several studies
have conﬁrmed that the nonﬁbrillar oligomeric conformers
primarily
responsible
neurotoxicity
[68].
Mechanistically, it is proposed that the low molecular
weight Ab oligomers possess hydrophobic nature, and
hence, favorably interact with the cell membrane of neurons
[68e71]. Such interactions lead to the perforation of the
membrane and disruption of the cell’s osmotic integrity
[68]. Apart from direct interaction with membrane aggre-
gated Ab also involves in several cellular and biochemical
events, such as increased oxidative stress, breakdown of
Ca2þ homeostasis, inﬂammation of brain tissues, metabolic
disturbances,
and accumulation of unfolded/misfolded
proteins [69,72e75]. These detrimental changes lead to the
onset of programmed cell death. In due course of time, the
AD brain is characterized by a substantial loss of neuronal
cells. The other hallmark features of Ab induced neuro-
toxicity is due to the disruption of interneuronal connec-
tions between nerve cells (neurons) [72]. Usually, neurons
transfer the messages between different parts of the brain
and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body
through the formation of interneuronal synapses, which are
often disrupted in the AD. Recent advances in brain

imaging techniques assist the researchers and clinicians in
making legitimate diagnoses. However, the practicalities of
these techniques are limited to the detection of the disease at
the terminal stage. Therefore, the scientiﬁc communities
across the globe intent to design novel strategies to di-
agnose the disease at the very ﬁrst step.
Tau protein (microtubule-associated protein
Tau, MAPT)
Tau proteins are one of the most abundant proteins present
in the central nervous system and play essential roles in
stabilizing microtubules [76,77]. In addition to Ab pep-
tides, Tau protein is equally responsible for development of
AD pathology. For the ﬁrst time in 1975, Tau was identi-
ﬁed as heat-stable proteins, and it was found to be essential
axonal

assembly
stability
[76].
Conversely, Tau proteins are also involved in several
essential functions, such as stabilizing of microtubules in
the cytoskeleton of neurons, promoting neurite growth,
cellular interactions and axonal transport of cell-organelles
to nerve terminals [78]. Tau proteins represent a set of
proteins formed as a result of alternative splicing of a single
gene referred to as MAPT (microtubule-associated protein
Tau) located on chromosome 17 and contains 15 exons
[79]. In humans, alternate splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10
leads to the formation of six isoforms of Tau proteins. Tau
proteins are generally referred to as phosphoproteins with
several serine and threonine residues that act as potential
phosphate acceptors. The longest possible isoform of Tau
consists of 79 phosphate acceptor residues (serine and
threonine) [77]. In general, Tau has more than 30 phos-
phorylated sites [77]. The overall function of Tau proteins
is generally regulated phosphorylation. The phosphoryla-
tion of Tau protein is achieved by a serine/threonine kinase,
usually referred to as Protein Kinase N1 (PKN) [80].
Activation of PKN leads to phosphorylation of Tau that, in
turn, causes their dissociation from microtubule and
breakdown axonal cytoskeleton. Disassembly of microtu-
bules due to hyperphosphorylation of Tau leads to
abnormal axonal transport of organelles, including mito-
chondria, which may further induce oxidative stress. It is
believed that the trafﬁcking of mitochondria at subcellular
locations is important for appropriate neuronal function
[77]. On the other hand, extensive phosphorylation of Tau
perpetuates extensive intermolecular interaction and for-
mation of Tau ﬁbrils. All the six isoforms of Tau proteins
found to be a hyperphosphorylated state in paired helical
ﬁlaments in the AD brains. Although the precise mecha-
nism and root cause for initiating hyperphosphorylation is
not fully understood yet. Recent reports suggest the
involvement of multiple factors in this process. For
example, the presence of astrocytes found to play an
essential for the Ab-induced Tau phosphorylation.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE)
APOE are proteins usually involved in the transport and
metabolism of fats. They were initially recognized for their
role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. More
recently, their role has been identiﬁed in cognitive
impairment and AD pathology [81]. APOE is a family of
polymorphic proteins, and the allelic forms differ from each
other by only one or two amino acids at positions 112 and
158 [82]. These truncations substantially alter the structure
and function of APOE. The most common alleles are of
FIGURE 28.1
Mechanistic basis of formation of Amyloid b (Ab) peptides and its aggregation into Ab oligomers and ﬁbrils.

three major types known as epsilon 2 (Cys112/Cys158),
epsilon 3 (Cys112/Arg158), and epsilon 4 (Arg112/
Arg158)). Amino acid differences at these positions play
crucial role as they alter the charge and structural properties
of the protein. The epsilon four variant of APOE is the
largest known genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD
in a variety of ethnic groups. However, this variant does not
correlate with risk in every population. It has been reported
that the Nigerians have the highest observed frequency of
the APOE4 allele in world populations, but the occurrence
of AD is rare among them [83,84]. APOE is also known to
enhance the proteolytic break-down of APP and formation
of aggregation-prone Ab peptides, within and between
cells. As stated earlier, AD is characterized by build-ups of
aggregates of the peptide beta-amyloid, a study surfaced in
2002 concluded that the persons with any combination of
APOE alleles, high serum cholesterol and high blood
pressure in mid-life are independent risk factors, however,
they can nearly triple the risk of developing AD in later
stages of life [85]. The investigators further projected that
the lowering of serum cholesterol levels might constitute an
important strategy for reducing the risk of AD, even if they
have two ApoE4 alleles.
APOE is usually synthesized in the liver and transported
to different parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys,
and spleen. In addition, the nonneuronal cell types, such as
astroglia and microglia, are the primary producers of
APOE, while neurons preferentially express the cell surface
receptors for APOE. The ApoE gene has been associated
with both familial late-onset and sporadic late-onset AD in
numerous studies. Individuals carrying ApoE4 allele usu-
ally have a high total cholesterol level. The high cholesterol
level has often been associated with the overproduction of
Ab peptide. One of the physiological functions of Ab that
has been suggested is to control cholesterol transport. In-
dividuals of 50 years and older who were prescribed
medication of statins have shown a substantially lower risk
of developing dementia. It is also suggested that the pres-
ence of cholesterol substantially reduces the levels of
sAPPa, ADAM10, and prevents the cleavage of APP in a
cholesterol-rich environment. Therefore, changes in cellular
cholesterol levels in AD are thought to be one of the major
contributing factors for neuronal degeneration.
Vascular and mitochondrial hypothesis
Vascular characteristics and mitochondrial hypotheses of
the pathogenesis of AD were also stated. Several vascular
risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome,
and obesity, have strongly been argued as a major
contributing risk factor associated with AD [81,86].
The presence of ApoE genotype is also link to the dy-
namics of cholesterol transport and hence implicated as a
considerable vascular risk factor in inﬂuencing AD pa-
thology. AD patients often exhibit numerous cerebrovas-
cular pathologies, including cerebral microinfarcts and
microbleeds. Microinfarcts are common in patients with
vascular dementia (weighted average 62%), AD (43%), and
demented patients with both AD-type and cerebrovascular
pathology (33%) compared with nondemented older in-
dividuals (24%) [86e88]. Amyloid formation and deposi-
tion are associated with cerebral hypoperfusion that might be
a risk factor initiate and/or accelerate the neurodegeneration
cascade causing synaptic and neural dysfunction and leading
to cognitive impairment [89]. Ab deposition into the capil-
lary wall is strongly associated with the ApoE4 allele as a
risk factor. Subsequently, the oxidative stress is often
induced by by hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction is
associated with AD pathogenesis [90,91]. It is known that
the functional mitochondria are translocated to the syn-
aptic terminals and back to cell soma with the help of a
microtubule-associated protein [72]. Tau protein, which is
known to be implicated in abnormal mitochondrial traf-
ﬁcking, it negatively affects the mitochondrial transport to
synapses upon hyperphosphorylation. The lack of ATP
generation in synaptic terminals seriously affects the
synaptic function and hence responsible for synaptic drip.
A possible interaction between Ab peptides and the amino
terminus of Tau fragment inhibits the mitochondrial
adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT-1) into the cytosol
and has a role in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptosis
pathway [86,91].
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
hypothesis
BDNF is considered to be an essential neurotrophic factors
required for differentiation, maturation, and survival of
neurons in the nervous system [92,93]. It displays a neu-
roprotective effect under chronic neuropathological condi-
tions and neurotoxicity [93]. Under normal conditions,
BDNF regulates the growth of new neurons, and its
decreased level is associated with many neurodegenerative
diseases, including AD and Parkinson’s disease [94]. Post
mortem analyses of AD brains have shown lowered levels
of BDNF is closely associated with prevalence of AD,
however, the the exact mechanism remains unclear. Studies
suggest that neurotrophic factors have a protective role
against amyloid beta toxicity [95]. Thus, administration
of BDNF may be considered as a therapeutic strategy in
the prevention and management of neurodegenerative
conditions [95].

Social and economic impact
Worldwide, dementia is recognized as one of the major
causes of frailty and dependency in the aged population
[96]. The disease has momentous social and economic
implications in terms of direct medical and social care
costs, in addition to the costs of informal care [96]. In 2015,
the total global societal cost of dementia was estimated to
be > US$ 800 billion, which translates into 1.1% of global
gross domestic product (GDP) [97]. The total cost as a
proportion of GDP varied from 0.2% in the low- and
middle-income countries to 1.4% in the high-income
countries. Dementia can be highly distressing for the fam-
ilies of affected people and for their caregivers [98]. On the
other hand, the diseased families frequently experience
physical, emotional, and ﬁnancial pressures that can cause
excessive stress to families and caregivers [6]. This ne-
cessitates a vital support system in terms of health, social,
ﬁnancial, and legal assistance not only to the patients but
also to the affected families [99].
It is often noticed that people with dementia are
frequently denied with their fundamental rights and free-
doms that are generally available to common citizens. In
many countries, physical and chemical restraints are
extensively used in care homes for older people. Despite
the regulation in place to uphold the rights of people to
freedom and choice, many restrictions are imposed in
acute-care settings. Therefore, an appropriate support sys-
tem based on the globally acceptable standards of human
rights is required to ensure the appropriate care for people
with dementia and their caregivers.
World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes demen-
tia as a critical health condition and should be considered as
a public health priority. To augment the efforts to minimize
the occurrence of dementia, the World Health Assembly
has endorsed a Global action plan on the public health
response to dementia 2017e2025 [100,101]. The draft of
the action plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for
policy-makers, international, regional and national agencies
for increasing awareness about dementia and the efforts to
establish dementia-friendly initiatives for reducing the risk
of dementia through accurate diagnosis, treatment, and care
as well as support for dementia caregivers, and research and
innovation [102].
Management and care of patients
suffering with AD
As dementia is becoming a global threat for the elderly
population, the effort has been all-around to moderate the
disease symptoms and provide guidelines for the disease
management from time to time. However, AD is growing
worldwide as a serious health problem, became the focus for
the evaluation of novel molecules and repurposing of existing
therapeutics. For the last 3 decades, tremendous efforts have
been channelized toward designing dietary formulations with
promising characteristics in the prevention and treatment of
age-related diseases. The principal goals for dementia care are
[102,103]; 1. Early diagnosis in order to promote early and
optimal management, 2. Optimizing physical health, cogni-
tion, activity, and well-being, 3. Identifying and treating
accompanying physical illness, 4. Distinguishing and treating
challenging
psychological
symptoms,
providing information and long-term support to caregivers. In
the recent past, several chemical substances belonging to the
class of natural dietary origin display protective and health-
promoting activities against AD and some age-related
neurodegenerative diseases.
Treatment and care
At present, there is no effective treatment currently
available to cure AD or to alter the progressive neuro-
degeneration. Numerous new treatments are being inves-
tigated, and the therapeutic formulations are in various
stages of clinical trials. However, several innovative
support systems need to be implemented in order to
improve the lives of people with dementia, their caregivers
and families. The pharmaceutical industries have not been
able to design or discover new drugs that have had a
signiﬁcant impact on the natural history of the disease.
Therefore, in the recent past, considerable attention is
being paid toward the amalgamation of many nutritional
bioactive compounds that can be useful in alleviating the
disease symptom in addition to provide fundamental
nutrition [104]. These bioactive molecules are frequently
isolated and puriﬁed directly from diet or supplementa-
tion. These compounds may be able to modify physio-
pathological processes responsible for neurodegeneration
and/or to have procognitive properties [105e107]. Such
dietary compounds, known as nutraceuticals, act at
different biochemical and metabolic levels and have
shown different types of neuroprotective properties. The
knowledge obtained from numerous observational studies,
clinical trials, and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
in humans, suggests that these nutraceuticals can be suc-
cessfully incorporated routine diet to protect from AD
[108]. We report results from studies on ﬂavonoids, some
vitamins, and other natural substances that have been
studied in AD, and that might be beneﬁcial for the
maintenance of a good cognitive performance [109]. Due
to the substantial lack of high-level evidence studies, there
is no possibility for the recommendation of nutraceuticals
in dementia-related therapeutic guidelines [108]. Never-
theless, the strong potential for their neuroprotective ac-
tion warrants further studies in the ﬁeld [108].

Nutraceuticals: an emerging trend in
disease management
There has been an increasing interest in the past decades
about interventions that may help to improve cognitive
performance in older age or, at least, delay the onset of
dementia. Due to the absence of a cure against dementia
and AD, the public health priority has focused more
recently on the prevention of cognitive decline [110].
Therefore, lifestyle strategies with beneﬁcial effects on
vascularitydincluding
natural
nutrition and nutritional supplementation, cognitive and
social activity, physical exercisedhave been identiﬁed as
possible target options for AD prevention [108].
The effect of a correct diet on human health has been
reported in many epidemiological studies and RCTs
[108,110,111]. There is clear cut evidence that suggest that
the diet rich in speciﬁc nutritional components is helpful in
reducing the incidence and prevalence of various clinical
outcomes, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer,
etc. [105]. These speciﬁc nutritional food groups are spe-
ciﬁcally rich in essential micronutrients and vitamins so that
they can provide fundamental nutrition and beneﬁcial
health-promoting effect similar to pharmaceuticals [112].
Such combinations are often deﬁned as nutraceuticals.
Among different types of diet, the Mediterranean diet pat-
terns gain the highest score for their health-promoting effect
[113]. Results of large epidemiological and bench studies
have shown its high content in nutraceuticals in Mediter-
ranean diets. These diet arrangements are characterized by
high consumption of plant foods, ﬁsh, olive oil as primary
sources of monounsaturated fat and moderate intake of
wine. This kind of food intake pattern might be particularly
healthy due to the synergistic actions of its components. It is
usually believed that the synergistic mechanisms between
different food components are responsible for their neuro-
protective effects. The onset of several pathological condi-
tions, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and lipid disorders are highly vulnerable to
change in the micronutrient levels. Hence, the nutraceuticals
formulations with an appropriate balance of micronutrients
and vitamins would have a therapeutic effect. A large
number of studies have conﬁrmed that the Mediterranean
dietary pattern put forth its beneﬁcial effects against mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [114]. In other words,
nutraceuticals are the foods, or the food components, that
offer comprehensive medical or health beneﬁts, including
prevention and treatment of several diseases [113]. Such
preparations or compounds possess antioxidant, antiin-
ﬂammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, and anticancer
properties, as well as they play regulatory roles for intra-
cellular and extracellular signaling pathways [115]. The
nutraceuticals market has signiﬁcantly grown in the last
decade due to increased information and awareness about
these compounds in the prevention and cure of numerous
diseases. Evaluating the precise role of nutrition and food
supplementation on decreasing the risk of developing AD
and other neurodegenerative diseases seems to be quite
difﬁcult. Generally, the older population displays poor di-
etary intake of fruits and vegetables, unhealthy behavior,
and higher prevalence of cerebrovascular disease, therefore,
the establishment of direct correlations are are the real
challenges. Furthermore, the impartial studies, like RCT of
nutritional supplementation and its effects on cognition, are
very much limited.
Dietary components of nutraceuticals
As stated previously, the available information for deter-
mining the association between cognitive impairment and
vitamin intake has some limitations [116]. Vitamins A, C,
and E are considered to be robust antioxidants. Since
reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with neuronal
damage in AD, the inclusion of these vitamins could offer a
therapeutic effect in AD management [117e119]. Antiox-
idants in food and supplements have been extensively
investigated in relation to prevention and management of
AD [120]. These antioxidants include tocopherol (vitamin
E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and carotenes (vitamin A).
Under in vitro conditions, vitamin E decreases lipid per-
oxidation and oxidative stress and interferes with the
inﬂammation
related-signaling
cascades
[109,119].
Vitamin C is known to prevent the formation of nitrosa-
mines through the reduction of nitrites and may also affect
catecholamine synthesis, whereas the presence of carotenes
known to adversely affect lipid peroxidation [109,119].
There are several studies with different methodologies
relating to the consumption antioxidant and their effect on
cognitive impairment. By considering these limitations,
there is some evidence from observational studies that
advocate dietary intake of antioxidants is associated with
the reduction in stroke risk; however, the controlled clinical
trials with antioxidant supplementation did not show any
decline in the risk of stroke [121]. The same is valid for the
antioxidant effect on cognitive decline and dementia. The
recent meta-analysis of observational studies concluded
that the dietary intakes of vitamin E, vitamin C, and
b-carotene can lower the risk of AD, with vitamin E
exhibiting the most pronounced protective effect [121,122].
Generally,
plasma
C < 11 mM is considered to be deﬁcient, 11e28 mM is
depleted or marginally deﬁcient, 28e40 mM is adequate, and
>40 mM is optimal [123]. Vitamin C is considered to be the
most effective antioxidant in body ﬂuid due to its high water
solubility and wide range of ROS activities. Since ROS and
oxidative stress associated with AD pathophysiology, there

have been some studies on the possible role of vitamin C is
anticipated in AD prevention [124]. Dixit et al. showed that
the administration of a single dose of intravenous vitamin C
improved short-term spatial memory in middle age (9 months
old) APP/PSEN1 mice [125].
The role of vitamin E in alleviating the AD symptoms
has been controversial, with several observational studies.
Many investigations have shown that vitamin E is helpful
in reducing the risk of AD and related dementias.
Controlled trials using supplementation of vitamin E have
shown a reduction of risk, nevertheless, no noticeable
improvement in cognition was observed in healthy older
women (>65 years) or in the patients of mild cognitive
impairment [126]. On the other hand, supplementation of
the vitamin with doses higher than 400 UI is not recom-
mended as it is associated with an increased rate of mor-
tality. In addition, the supplementation of vitamin E
displayed antioxidant activities only in half of the treated
patients,
possibly
due
unbalanced
monotherapy.
Furthermore, the optimum activity of vitamin E requires a
water-soluble electron acceptor to expedite the removal of
ROS [119]. This can usually be achieved by supplemen-
tation of selenium or vitamin C [119]. Two vital studies
suggest the beneﬁcial effect of high-dose vitamin E
(2000 UI a day) in AD patients. In the ﬁrst one, Sano et al.
claimed to slow down the progression of AD with during
2 years follow up of investigation. In the second study,
Dysken et al. suggest that administration of vitamin E was
helpful a reducing the deterioration of functional abilities
and hence was useful in decreasing the burden of the
caregiver of mild to moderate AD patients [127].
Supplementation of b-carotene, a precursor of vitamin
A, showed a substantial reduction in cognition impairment
[128]. Increased level of homocysteine, an amino acid, is a
precursor of methionine and cysteine, often linked with
increased risk of cerebrovascular events, poor cognitive
performance and commencement of AD. It has been shown
that the daily supplementation of vitamin B6, B12, and
folic acid reduced the increased levels of homocysteine
[129]. A recent meta-analysis study suggested that the
supplementation of vitamins B12 and B6 with folic acid
resulted in the reduction of cognitive decline, in patients
with or without previous cognitive impairment, with or
without stroke [130].
Phytochemicals are secondary metabolites exclusively
produced by plants and microbes [131]. They possess
neuroprotective potential, and hence, constitute an essential
component of nutraceuticals speciﬁcally to prevent and
cure AD [132]. As previously stated, increased oxidative
stress due to the overproduction of ROS is one of the
pathological outcomes of AD [133,134]. Hence mitigating
the ROS induced cell damage constitutes one of the core
objectives for designing antiAD nutraceuticals [134]. A
wide range of well-known nutritional compounds with
enriched antioxidant properties including vitamins C and E,
carotenoids, ﬂavonoids, polyphenols, and some enzymes
(such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and various per-
oxidases) [135]. Within these compounds, more emphasis
has been given to those biomolecules that have been
extensively researched for their antiamyloid and neuro-
protective properties [135].
Flavonoids are mostly synthesized by plants as secondary
metabolites, and they represent the group of most explored
biomolecules for numerous health beneﬁts. They belong to
a group of polyphenolic compounds that are commonly
found in the routine human diet [131]. Cacao, tea, fruits,
vegetables, and other plants are a good source of dietary
ﬂavonoids. Depending upon their chemical structures, they
can be divided into various subgroups. These molecules
have been extensively researched and found to have a
beneﬁcial effect on several neurological processes, such as
maintenance of neuronal, glial signaling pathways that is
essential for neuronal survival and proper function. Fla-
vonoids are also known to increase cerebral blood ﬂow,
expression of antioxidant enzymes, and various proteins
and signaling molecules, which play a vital role in main-
taining synaptic plasticity and neuronal repair [134]. On the
other hand, they have also been involved in interfering with
several neuropathological processes, which are responsible
for AD pathogenesis [136].
Flavanols
Flavanols are a main ﬂavonoid group and are found in
cocoa and chocolate, as well as in black and in grapes [137]
and green tea [138]. Research over the past decade has
identiﬁed ﬂavanols as showing diverse beneﬁcial physio-
logic and antioxidant effects, particularly in the context of
vascular function. Catechin and epicatechin are the most
abundant ﬂavanols in grape seeds and grape juice. A study
on supplementation of grape juice from a variety of Vitis
vinifera called “Koshu” found to inhibit glutamate excito-
toxicity [139]. Few clinical trials in humans suggest that
short and moderate-term supplementation with grape juice
produces beneﬁts in individuals with cerebrovascular dis-
eases, including increased serum antioxidant capacity, and
reduced LDL oxidation, improvement of endothelial func-
tion and reduction of platelet aggregation [140,141].
Quercetin is another most studied bioﬂavonoids, is
found in many common foods, such as capers, apples,
onions, and green tea. It is a highly potent antioxidant, and
hence, useful in preventing endothelial apoptosis caused by

increased ROS. There are several in vitro studies where
quercetin has demonstrated its ability to increase the cell
survival under neurotoxic conditions. In vivo studies have
demonstrated that quercetin could have a positive role in
vascular dementia by decreasing the size of ischemic le-
sions. Quercetin is reported to improve memory and hip-
pocampal synaptic plasticity
in models of cognitive
impairment induced by chronic lead exposure. Further, it
has the ability to induce repair in neuronal cells damaged
by spinal cord injury. Kaempferol is another widely
distributed biomolecule and commonly present in the daily
human diet in the form of fruits, beverages, tea, and veg-
etables [135]. Isolated kaempferol possesses the ability to
protects PC12 cells against the oxidative stress induced by
H2O2 and improves cognitive learning and memory capa-
bility in animal models. It was reported that the intake of
ﬂavonols, including quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin
has favorable effects on cognitive performance. Tradition-
ally, there are several plants that have been used since time
immemorial for the extraction and puriﬁcation of many
vital ingredients with the potential to relieve symptoms of
many diseases. Few representative plants and their phyto-
chemicals with neuroprotective and antiamyloid potential
are being discussed.
Tea (Camilla sinensis) leaves extract:
A number of vital phytochemicals have been isolated from
the leaves of tea plants. (-)-Epigallocathechin-3-gallate
(EGCG) is the key polyphenol extracted from the tea
plant (Camilla sinensis) and known to bind a large number
of proteins that are usually involved in various protein
misfolding diseases and inhibits their ﬁbrillation [138]. It
possesses a number of potential health-promoting princi-
ples, including antiinﬂammatory, antioxidant, and anti-
cancer, as well as anti-ageing activities [142]. In recent
times the consumption of green tea has been considerably
increased due to awareness about its multiple health-
promoting effects. A typical cup of tea containing 2.5 g
of tea leaves in 250 mL of hot water usually contains
roughly 177 mg of EGCG. Reports that emerged from
several studies suggest that EGCG has tremendous antiAD
potential. A study (involving murine neuron-like cells
(N2a) transfected with amyloid precursor protein (APP)
and primary neurons derived from APP-overexpressing
mice), showed that the application of EGCG inhibited Ab
generation and prevented the learning and memory im-
pairments [143]. Another study also suggested that the oral
administration EGCG substantially improved the cognitive
losses and reduced the neuronal apoptosis in the APP/PS1
mice [144]. Additionally, daily intake of EGCG by hy-
pertensive rats reduced the progressive increase of oxida-
tive stress and also decreased the concentration of reactive
oxygen species on the hippocampus [145]. These results
are of seminal importance from the point of view of its
therapeutic application [134]. In an animal model, EGCG is
shown to play a vital role in alleviating vascular-induced
loss in learning ability and memory deﬁcit [146]. EGCG
is also an established powerful antioxidant, able to
sequester iron and copper ions, and hence, neutralize their
catalytic activities that lead to the production of ROS [134].
EGCG also displays activity against many inﬂammatory
pathological conditions and able to easily cross the blood-
brain barrier [147], [148]. These properties render the
EGCG as potential nutraceuticals that may be systemati-
cally implicated for the management of AD and other
neurodegenerative disorders that includes oxidative stress
insults and inﬂammation, which subsequently leads to
cellular and neuronal death [138].
In addition to EGCG, both black and green teas usually
contain a high concentration of other catechins. A number
of different catechins demonstrated to have neuroprotective
characteristics against various neuropathological condi-
tions, including AD [149]. Despite the lack of clinical trials
diseases,
epidemiological observations in US and Finnish pop-
ulations showed a reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease in
high consumers of tea and a reduced risk of cognitive
impairment in a Japanese population drinking green tea
[149e151].
Ginkgo biloba (Gb) extract
Gb extract is commonly used for the prevention and
treatment of AD [152]. Extract from Gb leaves, and other
preparations mainly consist of terpenoids, ﬂavonol glyco-
sides, and proanthocyanidins. Increased cerebral blood ﬂow
and nitric oxide production in vessels and inhibition of
platelet-activating factors are thought to be the mechanism
of neuroprotection [153]. In studies involving animal
models of AD, Gb extract was found to ameliorate
Ab(1e42) induced hippocampal neuron dysfunction and
neuronal death. However, the clinal trials in the recent past
have not yielded encouraging outcomes, and hence, more
inclusive studies are needed to rich on decisive conclusion.
Turmeric (Curcuma longa)
Turmeric is a perennial herb, native to the monsoon forests
of south-east Asia and belongs to the Zingiberaceae
(ginger) family [154]. It is one of the most frequently used
spices
Indian,
Asian,
Middle
Eastern
foods
[155e157]. Apart from being used as a cooking spice, it
has often been recommended as herbal medicine against
several diseases [158e160]. Traditionally, curcumin has
been widely used in Indian (Ayurveda), Chinese, and
Persian medicines for the treatment of pain associated with
inﬂammation in skin and muscles [161,162]. It has also
been regularly used for treatment and cure of asthma,

## Page 415

allergy, anorexia, cough, sinusitis, hepatic diseases, etc
[162,163]. Curcumin is a yellow pigment extracted from
rhizomes of the plant and it is considered as one of the most
active curcuminoids [164]. The 21st century has witnessed
intensive interest in curcumin’s therapeutic properties,
which has resulted in considerable scientiﬁc enquiry in
connection with the development of traditional therapeutic
formulations against various diseases. Numerous studies
have established its powerful antiinﬂammatory properties
[165]. For example, animal and cell culture studies show
that curcumin reduces inﬂammation in arthritis. Curcumin
is also found to be effective in the treatment of irritable
bowel syndrome, psoriasis and other skin disorders [166].
Curcumin is also known for its antioxidant properties and
acts as a powerful free-radical scavenger [167]. Due to its
anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant properties, curcumin has
extensively been investigated to interfere with the pathways
leading to the onset of AD and associated pathological
outcomes [168]. Since, increased inﬂammation and oxida-
tive stress in the central nervous system constitute early
pathogenic events of AD, the antioxidant and anti-inﬂam-
matory potential of curcumin has logically been explored.
As stated before, oxidative stress and inﬂammation, Ab
aggregation, and hyperphosphorylation of Tau are recog-
nized as hallmark pathological characteristics of AD
[169,170]. It is also believed that abnormal metabolism of
Ab results in the formation of soluble neurotoxic Ab
oligomers, which are responsible for increased oxidative
stress, inﬂammation that lead to formation of an AD
pathogenic cycle of neurodegeneration [161,171]. In addi-
tion to its ability to interfere development of AD pathology
through its anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant properties,
curcumin is known to bind with Ab peptide and interfere
with its aggregation and deposition in the form of amyloid
plaques [172,173]. Furthermore, it has also been shown to
modulate Tau processing and aggregation, which consti-
tutes a key event in AD pathogenesis [174]. While the
initiating step of AD yet to be elucidated, the buildup of
oxidative stress and inﬂammatory reactions are thought to
begin decades before the ﬁrst clinical symptoms become
visible [175,176]. As stated before, Ab-induced patholog-
ical changes are believed to appear early in the disease
development process, and the recent ﬁndings suggests that
interferences that can interject the formation of Ab or ag-
gregation of Ab to form oligomers will be a remarkable
strategy for inhibition of aggregated Ab aggregation.
Studies based on theoretical mathematical models in people
over 60 years suggest that delaying the onset of AD pa-
thology by 1 year may reduce the worldwide burden of the
disease by approximately 10%, and 5 years delay could
reduce the incidence by almost half [177]. Hence, the early
preclinical evaluation and prevention therapy would have a
phenomenal impact on interfering with the events that
could lead to buildup of cerebral Ab and Tau pathology,
and/or oxidative stress and chronic inﬂammation. In this
way, the delaying the pathological events would play
phenomenal role in mitigation of the AD prevalence.
Several in vitro studies have suggested that the formation of
Ab is signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of curcumin
[178]. Possibly, curcumin exerts its effect through the
involvement in the altering of the APP processing through
the secretory pathway. Furthermore, studies with various
neuronal cell lines (e.g., pheochromocytoma cells, the
PC12 cell line) presence of 3e30 mM curcumin sup-
pressed Ab-induced BACE1 upregulation [179]. Most
recently, it is evident that the presence of curcumin was
useful
rescuing
ﬂies
Ab-induced
morphological
defects
Drosophila model [180]. Curcumin is reported to be a
suitable metal ion chelator, and therefore, able to prevent
the overexpression of APP and BACE1 induced by Cu(II)
and Mn [179].
Due to the antioxidant nature of curcumin, it is suggested
that it might be inﬂuencing the amyloid induced cytopathol-
ogy, or macrophage processing of amyloid. A recent study
suggests that curcumin helped in the reduction of plaque size
by 30% after 7 days of intravenous injection of curcumin
[181]. It has been reported that curcumin enhances phagocy-
tosis of Ab and help in the restoration of the cognitive
function, possibly by upregulating the expression of b-1,4-
mannosyl-glycoprotein
4b-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
(MGAT3), which is involved in phagocytosis [182]. There-
fore, it is argued that curcumin may be implicated in
ameliorating the immune defects and cognitive deﬁciency in
AD patients [183].
Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) (CZ)
Cinnamon is a common spice used in different frequently
parts of the world, including Sri Lanka, India, Madagascar,
and Indo-China countries. Mostly, the inner bark of the tree
has frequently been used in ethnic medicines, as well as the
ﬂavoring agent in food [184]. The antioxidant and antiin-
ﬂammatory activity helps in boosting cognitive function
[185]. Clinical studies have conﬁrmed its beneﬁcial effect
during various complications related to plasma lipids and
diabetes [186]. The antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory
properties of cinnamon have been responsible for providing
protection against the oxidative disorder by increasing the
expression of antioxidants enzymes activities [187]. The
antiamyloid nature of cinnamon is established by the in-
hibition of Tau aggregation and amyloid ﬁbril formation.
On the other hand, it stimulates disassembly of Tau ﬁbrils
isolated from the brains of those with AD. Interestingly,
the normal cellular function of Tau protein was found to
unaffected. [188].

Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.)
Black pepper has been used as a traditional medicine in
many Middle-Eastern and Asian countries as a potential
nerve tonic [189]. Piperine is one of the most abundant
alkaloid phytochemicals of the family Piperaceae and has
traditionally been used in folk medicine for the treatment of
various neurodegenerative diseases such as cognitive
impairment, including AD [190]. A recent study revealed
that oral administration of piperine can improve memory
deﬁcit in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the other
members of the pepper family, including Piper methysti-
cum, Piper submultinerve, and piper betel had been widely
considered to have a neuroprotective effect. Mechanisti-
cally the black pepper extracts are shown to have an antiAD
effect, and mechanistically it has been shown to protect
neurons from Ab1-42-induced neurotoxicity.
The antioxidant properties of piperine help in reducing
oxidative stress in an experimentally induced AD model
[191]. Several studies suggest that pepper extract also has
the ability to inhibit Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity
and helps in reducing lipid peroxidation [192]. The pepper
extract also has antiamyloid activity. In the animal model,
the administration piperine cocktail has shown to help in
improvement in Ab-induced memory loss, and reduce the
Ab levels in plaque deposition in the brain [193].
Ginger (Zingiber ofﬁcinale)
The rhizome of the ginger plant is known as a valuable
source of various phytonutrients, and therefore, it has been
extensively used in the preparation of many herbal rem-
edies and formulations [194,195]. Gingerol and zingiberene
are essential oils present in ginger, which gives character-
istic aromatic aura and a pungent taste [196e198]. It has
been reported that gingerol effectively suppressed the ag-
gregation of Ab(25e35), an amyloidogenic fragment of
Ab(1e40), reduced the Ab(25e35)-induced intracellular
accumulation of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species
[199]. It has also been anticipated that the treatment with
gingerol results in induced expression antioxidant enzymes.
6-Shogaol, obtained from ginger, is known to modulate
inﬂammatory reactions and suppress neuroinﬂammation
[200]. The hexane extract of ginger has also found to
inhibit the activities of proinﬂammatory mediators IL-1b
and inﬂammatory factors, such as nitric oxide, prosta-
glandin E2 and TNF-a [201]. Other phytochemicals such as
ﬂavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, and terpenoids extracted
from ginger display inhibitory effects on AChE, and also
involved in the prevention of Fe2þ-induced lipid peroxi-
dation [156,202,203]. Therefore, it is quite evident that the
phytonutrients in ginger may provide potential leads for the
development of novel anti-AD therapeutic strategies [204].
So far, the clinical trials of AD researches have not yielded
any curative therapeutic strategies against AD. The major
limitations associated with many active ingredients are
broadly attributed to poor absorption and bioavailability,
and maybe the timing and length of intervention studies.
Pathogenesis of AD involves multiple pathways, and
hence, a multifactorial approach will constitute a holistic
therapeutic strategy. Increasing the bioavailability, blood-
brain barrier penetration, and sustaining the half-life con-
stitutes the center of major attention. Researches pertaining
to various oral formulations are lacking, and hence, it is an
area for further investigation. On the one hand, the pre-
clinical signs of AD appear decades before its clinical
onset, and most of the time, the preventive measure be-
comes a limited approach. To date, most of the requirement
is based on the mature and late-stage AD manifestation. On
the other hand, it also opens a new window of opportunities
to implicate the molecules that have shown antiAD prop-
erties should be incorporated in the daily routine at least for
the individual above the age of 40 so that the disease can be
prevented or delayed. It is equitable to embrace interven-
tion studies for a longer duration with longitudinal follow-
up by including healthy community-dwelling older adults
along
distinctive
deﬁcient
individuals.
Moreover, discovery of novel biomarkers related to AD and
neuroimaging would be a further addition in rationalizing
the clinical signiﬁcance of nutraceuticals’ efﬁcacy in the
AD-associated
deterioration.
Although spices have been essential ingredients of many
Indian foods and have been in use for more than 2000
years, their health-promoting properties have been exten-
sively examined recently. Most of the spices contain many
active ingredients that show anti-AChE, antioxidants,
antiinﬂammatory properties, which are essential for the
development of successful nutraceuticals as novel formu-
lation agents against AD. On the other hand, speciﬁc nu-
trients need to be consumed along with routine diet to allow
the stabilization of undesirable biochemical reactions and
the formation of toxic substances leading to neuro-
degeneration and cell death. There is a need for large
clinical trials to examine the therapeutic potential of these
spices and their contribution in maintaining our cognitive
functions as we age.

According
Oxford
Dictionary
“nutraceutical,”
portmanteau derived from the words “nutrition” and “phar-
maceutical,” and is “another term for functional food” where
functional food is “a food containing health-giving additives.”
Plants have been used to treat medical conditions throughout
human history. Nutraceuticals have their historic roots trace-
able to apothecary, herbalism, ethnopharmacology, phyto-
therapy, and alternative medicines. The rational use of
medicines made the apothecarist a pharmacist, the quest for
principles of drug action ensued and eventually, development
of therapeutics and modern drug with clinical trials dawned.
The term “drug” has its origin in the French word “drogue”
meaning dried herb [1].

Indian traditional medicine system is a treasure trove of
health and medical knowledge and can boast of various
healing procedures, namely Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and
Ashtavaidya. Ancient Indian Ayurvedic texts like Charaka
Samhita, Susrutha Samhita, and Ashtangahrdayam, dating
back to 371e287 BC are still the infallible epitome of
medicine and surgery systems [2]. The contents of these
texts have survived the trials and tribulations of historical
unrest, skepticism of the wave of modern medical science,
and gloriously re-emerged as the knowledge base like none
other. Recognizing the wealth of knowledge these ancient
medicinal systems hold, a Traditional Knowledge Digital
Library (TKDL) was created by the Council of Scientiﬁc and
Industrial Research, Government of India, to ensure their
accessibility to the world in comprehensible formats [3,4].
Eastern hemisphere has been truly the cradle of ancient
civilizations as evident from a similar and equally enriched
medicine system of China recorded by Li Shizhen during the
Ming Dynasty (AD 1368e1644) in the Compendium of
Materia Medica, traditionally also referred to as Bencao
Gangmu or Pen-tsao Kang-mu. The knowledge of Chinese
herbal
medicine
further
developed
into
Kampo
medicine of Japan, known for managing nervous system
conditions. Japanese national healthcare system includes
herbal medicines as pharmaceutical preparations [1].
Knowledge of nutraceuticals has been always there
around the globe in one or the other form of traditional
medicinal systems and more importantly, very efﬁciently
integrated into the traditional lifestyles of different human
races.
modernization,
disappeared from human lifestyle, resulting in serious
health issues over time. Thus, it is difﬁcult to demarcate the
disappearance and readvent of nutraceuticals in the timeline
of modern medicine. Nevertheless, the legendary publica-
tions by Jim Joseph and colleagues [5,6], describing
behavioral and cognitive improvements due to blueberry,
spinach, or strawberry dietary supplements, were instru-
mental in repopularizing the signiﬁcance of nutraceuticals
to a newer human generation. There has been a gap in the
transmission of traditional knowledge down the generations
that has cost the human race heavily, and we still do not
know for how long and for how many generations we will
be paying for this with our health and that of our progenies.
This chapter is dedicated towards understanding the role
of nutraceuticals in maintaining brain health. Therefore, we
will be focusing on the nutraceuticals, in the form of
conventional foods and dietary supplements with direct
brain health beneﬁts like delayed aging, reduced or no side-
effects, maintained brain activities resulting in increased
life expectancy and preserving an overall healthy brain
physiology. Over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs
used for symptomatically treating brain disorders can be
detrimental to the very purpose they are meant to serve.
They can induce oxidative stress leading to a cascade of
other deleterious effects like chronic inﬂammation, mito-
chondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, and eventual loss of
synaptic plasticity [1] (Fig. 29.1).
Origin and deﬁnition
The term “Nutraceutical” was proposed by Dr. Stephen L.
De Felice in 1989, the founder Chairman of the American
organization, The Foundation for Innovation in Medicine
[7]. Health Canada deﬁned nutraceutical as “a product
prepared from foods, but sold in the form of pills, or powder
(potions) or in other medicinal forms, not usually associated
with foods” [8]. Thus, nutraceuticals have both the medicinal
as well as the nutritional values. Ayurveda, the 5000-
year-old ancient Indian system of medicine, supports this
fact till date. The overall health status of the human race is
being threatened due to increasing encroachment by a
multitude of diseases, some of which are very difﬁcult to
treat and some even untreatable. This emergent situation has
led to a renaissance in nutrition research exhaustively
exploring the disease-ﬁghting potentials of phytochemicals
from both food and non-food plants [9].
What all can be considered as nutraceuticals?
Nutraceuticals can be herbs, nutrients, or dietary supple-
ments. Thus, nutraceuticals can be both traditional and
nontraditional. Traditional nutraceuticals are natural prod-
ucts, with known potential health qualities and are not
subjected to any chemical alteration before consumption.
These include several fruits, vegetables, grains, soy, tea,
chocolate, ﬁsh, dairy, and meat products. Nontraditional
nutraceuticals result from agricultural breeding, genetic
modiﬁcations, or added nutrients and/or ingredients. For
example, extracted fruit juices with added calcium and
cereals with vitamins or other nutrients added. Therefore,
nutraceuticals have various sources, like, the food industry,
the herbal and dietary supplement market, the pharmaceu-
tical industry, and even, the newly merged pharmaceutical/
agribusiness/nutrition conglomerates. Nutraceuticals can be
isolated nutrients, herbal products, dietary supplements and
diets, even genetically engineered “designer” foods and
processed products such as cereals, soups, and beverages.
For example, many food products, categorized as poly-
unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), dietary ﬁber, probiotics,
prebiotics, ﬂavonoids, and other herbal extracts are nutra-
ceuticals [10]. The concept of nutraceutical is inspired by
the famous saying of the father of medicine, Hippocrates
(460e370 BC), “Let food be your medicine, and medicine
be your food” [11].

Nutraceuticals for brain health from around
the globe
Indian traditional medicine
Different types of spices like turmeric, garlic, coriander,
black pepper, ginger, cinnamon, clove, green pepper and
onion; herbs like basil, sage; nuts like almonds are an in-
tegral part of Indian diet and are known to be effective
against Alzheimer, Parkinson, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy,
neuropathic pain, cerebral ischemia, depression, schizo-
phrenia, meningitis, spongiform encephalopathy, and even
brain tumor [12e21] (Fig. 29.2).
Chinese traditional medicine
The Compendium of Materia Medica by Li Shizhen is the
most comprehensive record of traditional Chinese medi-
cine. It is a product of 30 years of rigorous ﬁeld study
enlisting all the plants, animals, minerals, and other natural
items with medicinal properties and consists of 1892 entries
from 800 other medical reference books [21].
One such medicine is Yi-Gan San (YGS) that consists of
seven
extracts,
namely,
Atractylodes
lancea
rhizome, Poria sclerotium, Cnidium rhizome, Uncaria thorn,
Japanese Angelica root (Angelica radix), Bupleurum root, and
Glycyrrhiza in the proportions of 4:4:3:3:3:2:1.5. YGS has
been administered to children for treating restlessness and
agitation. It is also useful in treating neuropsychological
disorders such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of
dementia (BPSD) in the elderly, a number of symptoms of
borderline personality disorder, tardive dyskinesia, and
psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia [21].
Japanese traditional medicine
Yokukansan (YKS), a traditional Japanese Kampo medi-
cine, originated from traditional Chinese YGS. Both, YKS
and YGS have similar compositions. YKS is effective
against excitatory BPSD (behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia) such as hallucinations, agitation,
aggressiveness
suffering
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), and other forms of senile dementia [22].
African traditional medicine (ATM)
Ghana boasts of a wide array of medicinal ﬂora and its
longstanding cultural use of traditional and alternative
medicines (TAMs), as is evident from several published
FIGURE 29.1
Potential beneﬁts of nutraceuticals in brain dysfunction. Nutraceuticals have more than nutritional value. Their synergistic actions
subtly inﬂuence key cellular signaling that favors improved neuronal function. Medicine is an independent molecule designed to act speciﬁcally on one
target, is used at higher doses and which over prolonged use adversely affects normal cellular functions, even leading to cellular toxicity. Side-effects of
medicines can exacerbate the situation by aggravating dysfunctional bioenergetics, oxidative stress, DNA damage, inﬂammation, and neuronal injury.
These processes contribute to aging and cellular crises, eventually, leading to brain damage. Nutritious food containing molecules with medicinal value
can alleviate these disruptive mechanisms by correcting deranged cellular signaling. Thus, nutraceuticals help to repair cellular damage, thereby improving
brain health. Reproduced with permission from Williams RJ. Neuro-nutraceuticals: the path to brain health via nourishment is not so distant. Neurochem

services like acupuncture, moxibustion, and cupping have
been covered by National Health Insurance since 1987.
Treatments using most herbal extracts are also covered by
the Korean health insurances, with the only exception of
decoctions of raw herbs [26]. All these factors have placed
traditional medicine at par with modern medicine in Korea.
Traditional medicine of Latin America
Mexican traditional medicinal system identiﬁes bodily and
mental unrest as “nervios,” a folk illness, reported across
many countries in Latin America. Nervios is mostly treated
with the help of herbal tea made from a combination of
Agastache
mexicana
(toronjil
morado),
Agastache
mexicana subsp. xolocotziana (toronjil blanco), Dracoce-
phalum moldavica (toronjil azul or chino), Cinnamonum
sp. (canela), different species of Citrus ﬂowers (ﬂor de
azahar), Chiranthodendron pentadactylon (ﬂor de manita),
Ternstroemia sp. (tila), Foeniculum vulgare (hinojo),
Ipomea stans (tumbavaquero), to name a few. Interestingly,
92 plant species, belonging to eight families, namely,
Asteraceae, Rutaceae, Lamiacea, Passiﬂoraceae, Valer-
ianaceae, Rosaceae, Theaceae, and Verbenaceae are used to
treat nervios in different parts of Mexico. Likewise, nine
plant species from eight families are used to treat depres-
sion. People suffering from anhedonia, low self-esteem,
mental slowness, and loss of concentration are treated with
extracts from Mimosa pudica, Tagetes lucida, Annona
cherimola, Byrsonima crassifolia, and Litsea glaucescens.
These herbal extracts have been tested for their potential
antidepressant properties in animal models of depression
[33]. Traditional Mexican medicinal system uses Galphi-
mia glauca, Tilia americana L. var. mexicana, Lippia alba,

mexicana for treating anxiety. Anxiolytic effects of these
species have been established in anxiety animal models
also [33] (Table 29.1).
Oxidative stress, acetylcholine deﬁciency in the brain,
and inﬂammatory processes are associated with AD. In the
northeast region of Brazil, various plants are used to treat
several diseases associated with these processes. Such plants
with positive effects on cognitive disorders, strong acetyl-
cholinesterase inhibitory, anti-inﬂammatory, and antioxidant
activities are potential therapeutics for treating AD [34]. An
ethnobotanical survey of northeast Brazil for the major
plants with these properties identiﬁed Hymenocallis speciosa
(mangaba fruits) with the best antioxidant and anticholin-
esterase properties [35]. These properties are attributable to
the presence of antioxidant compounds such as phenols,
tannins, ﬂavones, ﬂavonoids, leucoanthocyanidins, and
alkaloids [36]. Copaifera langsdorfﬁi also exhibited high
acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity due to its ability to
increase acetylcholine, thereby, employing mass production
of the substrate to induce substrate-mediated inhibition of
enzymatic activity [35]. The currently used hypoglycemic
agent, Bauhinia forﬁcata is a potent anticholinesterase and
has a high antioxidant capacity. Therefore, it is also being
considered as a potential therapeutic against AD [35].
Nutraceutical and overall brain health:
Traditional versus modern outlook
Before exploring the role of nutraceuticals in maintaining
brain health, it is pertinent to have a basic understanding of
the physiological changes associated with neurodegenerative
conditions. This will help in better appreciation of the pre-
cise and meticulous scientiﬁc reasoning behind the princi-
ples of traditional medicinal systems that form the basis of
nutraceuticals.

Pathophysiology of neurodegenerative
The life expectancy of humans has considerably increased
in developed and developing countries due to advance-
ments in medical research and discovery of life-saving
drugs against several debilitating and life-threatening
scourges such as cancer, infectious diseases, and meta-
bolic disorders. However, with the increase in longevity of
life, several other lifestyle-associated diseases such as
cardiovascular diseases, type-2 diabetes, and various
forms
age-associated
neurodegenerative conditions such as AD, Parkinson dis-
ease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been
emerging at a high rate [37]. Neurodegenerative diseases
are one of the most debilitating conditions and usually
associated with mutated genes, accumulation of abnormal
proteins, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), or
destruction of the neurons in a speciﬁc part of the brain
[38e42]. The prevention of neurodegenerative diseases
has been one of the primary goals of researchers, but to
make
feasible,
two
objectives
must
accomplished: (1) individuals at high risk for the disease
must be identiﬁed before the symptoms become evident,
and (2) compounds that are safe and effective in either
reducing or slowing the disease progression need to be
developed.
Improved
experimental
models,
modern
research techniques and research in the ﬁeld of neurosci-
ence have advanced our understanding of the unique
mechanisms of the onset and expansion of the neuro-
degeneration and toxicants-induced neurotoxicity. Among
several recognized mechanisms, the damage to neuronal
mitochondria, intracellular calcium ion (Ca2þ) overload,
uncontrolled generation of ROS, sustained inﬂammatory
condition, or any combination of these are the common
busy high-roads for neurotoxicity [43e50]. Although, the
causative reason for the onset of neurodegeneration may
differ,
progression
toxicant-induced
neuronal
damage and neurodegenerative disorders largely involves
the same shared mechanisms, reinforcing the importance
of these pathways as common targets for the intervention
strategies. Utilizing the knowledge of the etiology of the
neurodegenerative diseases, target-based therapies such as
neurotransmitter modulators, direct receptor agonists/an-
tagonists, second messenger modulators, stem cellse
based therapies, hormone replacement therapy, neuro-
trophic factors, as well as regulators of the mRNA syn-
thesis and its translation into disease-causing mutant
proteins have been developed [51e58]. Although, these
strategies are great tools to mitigate the neurodegenerative
processes, such treatments are often associated with
adverse effects and long-term unknown consequences
[52,55,57,58]. Therefore, treatment options in alternative
systems of medicines are being actively explored.
In majority of neurodegenerative diseases, histopatho-
logical signs display ﬁbrillar proteinaceous deposits, due to
polymerization of speciﬁc misfolded, aggregated proteins
and peptides (listed in Table 29.2) [59]. The authenticity of
amyloid hypothesis in the pathology of neurodegeneration
is well established. However, the prevention of ﬁbril
formation can only delay the onset of disease pathology.
Interestingly, a calorie-sparse, nutrient-dense, plant-based
diet rich in nutraceuticals is believed to be effective not
only in preventing but curing neurodegenerative diseases.
Effects of nutraceuticals on neurodegenerative
Worldwide, annually more than 10 million people suffer
diseases.
Unfortunately,
number is expected to increase. Western countries witness a
predominance of neurodegenerative conditions among
people aged 70e79 years. The geriatric population in these
countries is 3.1% which is prone to neurodegenerative
diseases, whereas this ﬁgure is signiﬁcantly, as low as, just
0.7% in places like India. According to accumulating
evidence, this difference is majorly because of lifestyle and
food habits. From ancient times, Asian countries, particu-
larly India, depend on spices or natural products to cure
most of the ailments and have been successfully using them
for disease prevention. These spices and natural products
have been used not only as medicines but they have been an
integrated part of ethnic cuisines of these countries, and
thus, have been a part of their regular diets. A spice is
usually a dried-up seed, fruit, root, bark, or ﬂower from a
plant. Thus, nutraceuticals have been an integral part of
Indian and other Asian diets long before even the term was
coined. Nutraceuticals can have both prophylactic and
therapeutic properties with minimal to absolutely no side-
effects. They have always been a part of traditional and
folk herbal medicine.
The high metabolic rate and suboptimal free radical
scavenging system, relative to the rest of the body, make
human brain extremely susceptible to oxidative stress.
Probably, because the world’s oldest documented medical
systems like Ayurveda, Unani, and traditional Chinese or
Asian medicine were aware of this, they prescribed the use
of a number of plants with antioxidant activity as
therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases [60]. Medhya
(intellectual promoting) herbs have been helpful in cogni-
tive disorders [61]. Nootropic agents proved excellent in
improving memory, mood, and behavior [62]. Ayurveda
categorizes metabolic defects in three categories based on
the particular dosha out of tridoshas, viz., “Vata,” “Pitta,”
and “Kapha” being affected. Tridoshas are believed to
govern movements and activities, the health and energy
levels, and growth and structural modiﬁcation, respectively
[63]. Malfunctioning of any of these driving forces, due to

unfavorable environment or improper diet, results in
pathologic conditions [64]. Through its major discipline
“Rasayana tantra,” Ayurveda focuses on treatments to
improve longevity, memory, and physical appearance of an
individual. Automatically, this results in well-nurtured
cognitive performance and physical strength. Thus, Ayur-
veda is not just a collection of herbal therapies, but rather a
regimen for a healthy, disease-free mode of life [65].
Traditional Chinese and other Asian medicinal concepts are
based on “Yin, Yang, and Qi” believed in these traditions to
be the components of “vital energy.” These systems of
medicine also employ herbs for neuroprotection. The World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates almost 70%e80% of
the world population to be relying on traditional medicine
either directly in the form of diet and herbal extracts, or
indirectly as extracted active components used in the modern
methods as drugs, otherwise being referred to as nutraceut-
icals [61,66]. A brief report on a few popularly used herbs as
therapeutic agents in traditional or folk medicines for
neurological conditions is provided below. These are also
the basis for nutraceuticals maintaining brain health.
Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi)
Baccopa monnieri traditionally known as Brahmi is well
known for its potential to rejuvenate nerve cells and the
ability to improve memory power. It is commonly found in
India and Australia. Brahmi has two saponins, namely
Bacoside A and B, which are made up of Sapogeninsd
Bacogenins A1eA4, betulic acid, and various alkaloids.
Among the two main saponins, Bacoside A improves
power
[67].
Besides
boosting
memory,
B. monnieri has antioxidant, antistress, anti-inﬂammatory,
antimicrobial, and smooth muscle relaxant activities [68].
Antioxidant and antistress activities of B. monnieri have
been effective against stress mediated dysfunction of nerve
cells in Huntington disease (HD) [69]. Antioxidant activity
of B. monnieri is modulated by the availability of Gluta-
thion (GSH) and the activity of Glutathion reductase (GR)
and is mediated through activation of Hsp70, P450, and
superoxide dismutase [70,71].
Ginkgo biloba
The leaf extract of Ginkgo biloba, commonly known as
living fossil, contains trilactonic diterpenes (ginkgolide
AeC, ginkgolide JeM), trilactonic sesquiterpene (biloba-
lide), and various ﬂavonoids known for their antioxidant
properties. It is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine
[72,73]. It also prevents aggregation of blood platelets and
therefore is potent against ischemic hemorrhage [74]. In
addition, this extract inhibits the formation of A-beta from
b-amyloid precursor protein, thus, having potential against
AD [75]. The active components of the extract compete with
free cholesterol to interact with the A-beta and decrease its
aggregation. Gingko extract is a potent neuroprotective
and antiapoptotic agent that effectively inhibits ROS accu-
mulation by A-beta and reduces neuronal apoptosis which
preludes neurodegenerative disease [76e78].

Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha or Indian
ginseng)
Withania somnifera or Ashwagandha, as known traditionally,
has been since time immemorial used as anti-inﬂammatory,
antioxidant, antistress, neuroprotective, immune boosting,
and memory enhancing agent in Ayurvedic system [79e81].
W. somnifera inhibits the release of corticosterone and
activates choline-acetyltransferase to inhibit stress-induced
NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity and consequently
boosts serotonin in the hippocampus [82]. The active
components of W. somnifera such as withanolide A, with-
anolide IV, withanolide VI facilitate pre- and postsynaptic
reconstruction and axonal and dendritic regeneration [83,84].
Convolvulus pluricaulis
Convolvulus pluricaulis is a perennial herb, all parts of
have therapeutic
beneﬁts.
Indian and
Chinese
medicinal formulations widely use this plant to cure various
diseases like chronic cough, sleeplessness, epilepsy, hallu-
cinations, anxiety, etc. [85]. A wide variety of in vitro and
in vivo pharmacological effects like CNS depressant,
anxiolytic, tranquilizing, antidepressant, antistress (psycho-
logical, chemical, and traumatic), anti-neurodegenerative,
antiamnesic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, immunomodula-
tory, and analgesic effects have been reported [85]. Other
prominent effects of the ethanolic and methanolic extracts of
the whole plant include reduced spontaneous motor activity
and ﬁghting response, potentiated pentobarbitone hypnosis
and morphine analgesia, abolished conditioned avoidance
response, antagonized convulsive seizures and tremorine-
induced tremors in mice [85].
Centella asiatica (gotu kola)
C. asiatica is commonly used as a green leafy vegetable, in
traditional diets in different parts of the world due to its
well-known health beneﬁts. It is widely used in Ayurvedic,
Unani, and folk medicines in India, Sri Lanka, Southeast
Asian countries, China, and Africa over the centuries [86,87].
C. asiatica possesses neuroprotective, neuroregenerative,

degenerative conditions of the aging population like AD,
senile dementia, and PD [94,95].
Acorus calamus (sweet ﬂag)
This semiaquatic, perennial, aromatic herb with creeping
rhizomes is endemic to the northern temperate and sub-
tropical regions of Asia, North America, and Europe [96].
Among the many ethnomedicinal and ethnobotanical uses
ascribed to the rhizomes of A. calamus are treatments of
memory disorder, enhancing learning performance, anti-
aging and anticholinergic activities through traditional
Chinese and Indian prescriptions. Active components of
Acorus rhizome, a- and b-asarone, possess a wide range of
neuropharmacological activities like sedative, CNS depres-
sant, behavior modifying anticonvulsant, acetylcholines-
terase inhibitory, memory enhancing, anti-inﬂammatory,
antioxidant,
hypolipidemic,
immunosuppressive,
cytoprotective to name a few [96].

Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani systems of medicine use
H. indicus to treat a variety of diseases including epileptic
seizures and chronic nervous diseases [98].
Trapa bispinosa (water chestnut)
T. bispinosa is an established neuroprotective herb that has
been used as nerve tonic from ages. It reduces D-galactose-
induced oxidative stress by activating glutathione peroxi-
dase and catalase to reduce lipid peroxide [99].
Holy basil
It is known since the Vedic age for its immense curative
and multipurpose utility. It has anticonvulsion potential,
analgesic activity. It can increase motor activity, normalizes
neurotransmitter levels in brain, inﬂuences the neuro-
chemistry of the brain, and enhances memory [100].
Semecarpus anacardium (Bhallaatak)
S. anacardium is an ancient traditional herb mentioned in
Valmiki Ramayana, one of the most sacred books of India
written before 3000 BC [101]. Medicinal potency of this
plant is evident from its popularity as Ardha Vaidya in
Ayurveda meaning half-physician. Truly, it could cure

almost any ailment. Its fruit was considered as a golden
acorn during the period of Galen (Greek physician, AD
130e210) and Avicenna (Persian mathematician, AD
980e1037) in Western society [102]. Consumption of
S. anacardium without proper detoxiﬁcation could be

cancer and cerebro-cardiovascular disorders [101].
Nardostachys jatamansi (spikenard or
jatamansi)
The root extract of N. jatamansi is an aromatic antispas-
modic, diuretic, neuroprotective tonic with carminative,
deobstruent, digestive, and reproductive stimulant proper-
ties. Besides, Ayurveda recommends its application in
spasmodic hysteria, other nervous convulsive ailments,
nervous headache, epilepsy, and convulsions [103].
Panax ginseng (ginseng)
It is a popular medicinal herb of Korean and Chinese
origin,
known
treating
cancer,
disorder, hypertension, and diabetes. The active compo-
nents of P. ginseng, Ginsenosides, Rb1 and Rg3, possess
remarkable neuroprotective activity making it an excellent
treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases [104].
Ginsenoside acts on dopaminergic neurons by reducing
neural iron levels and concomitantly lowering the expres-
sion of divalent metal transporter (DMT1) and potentially
increasing that of ferroportin (FP1) in PD [105].
Clitoria ternatea
C. ternatea is a popular Ayurvedic “Medhya” or brain tonic
used for treating “Manasika roga” or mental illness. Extract
of C. ternatea improves memory retention and increases
acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity in
the different regions of brain, namely, cerebral cortex,
midbrain, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum [106].

Curcumin or turmeric, the most common spice in Indian
cuisines, is known for its cosmetic and medical properties in
Ayurveda for many years. It is actually a storehouse of
dietary ﬁber, potassium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins.
Among its diverse medical properties are anti-inﬂammatory,

Wolfberry is commonly used in Chinese medicine as
antiaging agent. Pretreatment of cortical neuron with
L. barbarum extract reduced lactate dehydrogenase release
and blocked Ab-peptide activated caspase activities. This
protected the pretreated neurons from deleterious effects of
Ab peptide [113,114].
Dietary supplements
Consumption of non-nutritive chemicals from plants like
terpenoids and ﬂavonoids, rich in antioxidants, reduced
lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant levels in blood
plasma. Similarly, a-lipoic acid is another potent antioxi-
dant that plays a vital role in brain function, glucose
metabolism in the brain, and stabilizing cognitive function
in AD affected brain [9]. Consumption of phytochemicals

the nutrients are taken as supplements in the form of tablets,
capsules, etc., it is more of a modern practice. However, if
the dietary regime is deﬁned to include these nutrients in
the form of food taken, as has been the case with ethnic
food habits, it will be a traditional outlook on nutraceut-
icals. Which out of these two practices is a more effective
way of consuming nutraceuticals, remain undecided. When
nutraceuticals are consumed as a part of the food eaten,
they are not taken alone; rather, the body receives a
combination of several nutraceuticals. This can prove to be
more beneﬁcial than consuming speciﬁc nutraceuticals
individually. In combination, bioavailability of nutraceut-
icals may improve and synergism may be expected. Evo-
lution of human food habits has been a function of several
factors acting simultaneously to help the ﬁttest combination
to survive, surface, and stabilize. Therefore, the human
digestive system can be expected to be more in tune with
dietary combinations of nutraceuticals rather than dietary
supplementation of the same. Two classic cohort studies on
effects of Mediterranean and Asian diets in preserving brain
health in aging populations will justify this perspective.
Mediterranean diet (MD)
MD is attributed to better cognitive functions in aged
people: 9 out of 12 eligible studies conﬁrmed lower rates of
cognitive decline and reduced risk of AD in people
adopting the MD [171]. Similar results were reported by
the PREDIMED study (PREvencio’n con DIeta MEDi-
terra’nea) carried out on a cohort of 578 subjects [172].
These subjects conformed to the traditional MD and were
evaluated for their cognitive performance and total urinary
polyphenol excretion [172]. This study showed that higher
intakes of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), coffee, walnuts,
and wine signiﬁcantly improved memory and global
cognition due to their high polyphenolic contents. A new
large randomized controlled trial, the NU-AGE, has
recently been launched with the rationale that a 1 year

(the so-called “inﬂammaging”) in 65- to 79-year-old
subjects, will improve their physical and cognitive status
[173e175]. The MD-associated beneﬁts result from com-
plex association and interaction of diet and habits. Thus,
great efforts have to be deliberately made to individuate
nutritional factors endowed with speciﬁc healthy biological
activities so that these studies can provide useful infor-
mation
design,
integration,
fortiﬁcation.
Asian diet
A similar study in Hisayama was conducted on 1006 sub-
jects aged 60e79 years from 1988 to 2005 [176]. Through
correlations between diet and incidence of various types of
dementia (and other age-associated diseases), this study
identiﬁed a dietary pattern that was associated with a
reduced risk of dementia in a general Japanese elderly
population. This pattern was characterized by high intakes
of soybeans and soybean products, vegetables, algae, milk
and dairy products, and a low intake of rice. Rice was not
deleterious in itself, but a high intake of it restricted
consumption of those foods that are potent in preventing
dementia [176].
Another interesting case of correlation between dietary
habits and brain health is the Okinawan diet from Japan.
Okinawan population has strikingly higher longevity and
low risk of age-associated diseases (including AD) relative
to the rest of the Japanese population [177]. Interestingly,
when people emigrated from Okinawa to other countries
and adapted the local dietary pattern, the incidence of
various forms of dementia, including AD, increased in aged
people and became similar to that of the surrounding
populations [178]. This is compelling evidence that estab-
lished the relevance of dietary factors over genetic ones in
this case. Okinawan diet differs from MD in a much lower
intake of calories from fat. Calorie requirements of Oki-
nawan diet are met by carbohydrates from sweet potatoes
(roots and leaves), and not rice. Both the Okinawan and the
MD diets are based on high vegetable and legume intake
(though in the former these are essentially soybeans) and
scarce in meat [179]. So, the Okinawan diet clearly coveys
that the healthiest foods are those which are poor in calories
and rich in nutrients, for example, sweet potatoes, they are
extremely rich in antioxidants (mostly vitamin A and C,
and also phenolic compounds). They have signiﬁcant anti-
inﬂammatory, antihyperglycemic, and lipocholesterolemic
effects; are good sources of B vitamins, including folate,
thiamine, riboﬂavin, and vitamin B6 [9,180,181]. Interest-
ingly, folate and vitamin B6 convert homocysteine into
cysteine.
High
homocysteine
increased risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia.
Thus, the Okinawan diet reduces risks of cardiovascular
mortality and dementia. Serum homocysteine levels are
particularly low in Okinawan people. Besides sweet po-
tatoes, other ingredients of this diet like turmeric, accounts
for its particular healthiness. Turmeric is a popular spice
both in Okinawa and in India. Its long-term consumption in
India is associated with a 4.4-fold reduced rate of AD
incidence compared to the USA [182]. Therefore, it is the
diet again that manifests the health beneﬁts (Table 29.4).

Mechanistic insights into nutraceuticals
functioning as protectors of brain
Genetic mutations, accumulation of abnormal proteins,
increased ROS, and/or destruction of the neurons in a
speciﬁc part of the brain are associated with the debilitating
conditions of neurodegenerative diseases [38e42]. Among
the well-understood mechanisms behind the etiology of
toxicants-induced
neurotoxicity
observed in case of AD, PD, HD, MS, and ALS, the salient
ones are neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, intracellular
Ca2þ
overload,
unrestrained
generation
prolonged neuroinﬂammation individually or in combination
[183e186]. Improved experimental models, techniques, and
exhaustive on-going research in the ﬁeld of neuroscience
have been instrumental in identifying the aforementioned
mechanisms [43e50,187]. Ca2þ homeostases across the
cellular, endoplasmic reticular (ER), and mitochondrial
membranes are critical for normal cellular physiology.
Maintenance
Ca2þ
homeostasis
across
membrane systems is coordinated precisely through several
specialized mechanisms. Naturally, any perturbation to these
mechanisms disrupts the ﬁne coordination between different
levels Ca2þ homeostasis, resulting in unfettered increase in
the intracellular and intraorganellar (ER and mitochondria)
Ca2þ concentrations. This calcium overloading eventually
leads
pathogenesis
[188e190].
ROS-induced mitochondrial
during neuro-
degeneration not only impairs cellular energy production but
also triggers deregulation of Ca2þ homeostasis. In addition,
mitochondrial failure enhances generation of ROS through a
positive feedback loop [191]. Such in-depth understanding
of disease mechanism led to signiﬁcant development in
target-base
therapies
involving
stem
cells,
hormone
replacement, modulation of neurotransmitter, and expres-
sions of pathogenic alleles [51e58]. Particularly, great hopes
are laid on neural transplantation and stem cellsebased
therapies against the range of neurodegenerative diseases
[192e194]. However, these treatments come with side-
effects both known and unknown, some of which could be
long term as well [52,55,57,58]. Therefore, an emergent
need to identify safer alternative treatment options, particu-
larly, those employable for longer duration was felt. Thus,
nutraceuticals capable of multitargeting to improve the
overall neuronal health with minimal or no side-effects
became an attractive option [195e200].
Improved understanding of neurodegenerative etiology
led to several target-based therapeutic options. However, as
mentioned earlier, these options have several adverse side-
effects, and thus are not suitable for chronic use, which
sometimes is an absolute requirement. There are encouraging
outcomes from quest for safe, side-effect-free alternative
natural remedies, with both prophylactic and curative prop-
erties. Such protective strategies including nutraceuticals
have gained popularity, since the coining of the term “Nu-
traceutical” by Dr. Stephen DeFelice, in 1989 [7]. These are
food-based remedies to prevent and/or treat a wide variety of
diseases and disorders [201]. Nutraceuticals can simulta-
neously act on multiple cellular pathways. Being part of the
diet or a dietary supplement, nutraceuticals are suitable for
prolonged administration. Both these attributes make them
most favorable for treating neurodegenerative ailments,
which often being chronic, require long-term treatments.
Popular nutraceuticals, like, resveratrol, a-lipoic acid, coen-
zyme Q10 (ubiquinone), b-carotene, lycopene, astaxanthin,
and curcumin are potent antioxidants that can neutralize
oxidative stress and boost endogenous antioxidant levels. In
the process, they stabilize mitochondrial functions. Mito-
chondrial dysfunction is an important reason behind neuro-
degeneration.
Thus,
inherent
nature
nutraceuticals makes them most suitable remedies for neu-
rodegeneration [198e200,202e205]. Neuroprotective ef-
fects of nutraceuticals are not just due to their ability to
scavenge free radicals, chelate transition metals, improve
antioxidant reserve, and reduce inﬂammation, rather, their
capability to modulate various signaling pathways plays an
important role in this. These nutraceuticals modulate Nrf2/
ARE, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein
kinase C (PKC), Janus kinase-Signal Transducer and Acti-
vator of Transcription (JAK-STAT), MEK/ERK/CREB,
PI3K/AKT
insulin-signaling
important for cell survival and stress response [206e213].
Nutraceuticals affect multiple molecular pathways. There-
fore, in addition to treating neurodegeneration, nutraceuticals
are anticipated to improve overall neuronal health. Epide-
miological studies of World Health Organization, carried out
by Professors Doll and Peto in the 1980s, suggested that
approximately 35% of cancer deaths can be prevented
through appropriate nutrition. Even 90% of certain cancers
can be avoided by dietary supplementation [214]. This is
indeed an encouraging observation for considering nutra-
ceuticals in treating neurodegenerative conditions. This
section of the chapter will cover the various molecular
pathways targeted by nutraceuticals in alleviating neurode-
generative conditions.

[183,215]. Among the nutritional supplements explored for
their potential role in preserving mitochondrial functions,
curcumin, a-lipoic acid, astaxanthin, and coenzyme Q10

very common spice used in Indian recipes. It ameliorated

[216]
(Fig. 29.4A). a-Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring fatty
acid found in foods like spinach, broccoli, potatoes, yeast,
and organ meats such as liver and kidney. It is very efﬁcient
in stabilizing neuronal mitochondria, both in vitro and
in vivo against hypoxia and other toxicants-induced
neurotoxicity. It improves mitochondrial functions and
physiology [218] (Fig. 29.4B). Clinical trials on use of
a-lipoic acid in patients with diabetic and cancer chemo-
therapy associated peripheral neuropathies have been
conducted [219,220]. Astaxanthin is a ketocarotenoid that
imparts pink or red pigmentation in salmon, trout, lobster,
shrimp, and other seafood. Studies showed that astaxanthin
can protect mitochondria in cultured nerve cells and boost
cellular energy production. It also restrained production of
ROS [217,221,222] (Fig. 29.4C). Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
is a vitamin-like substance found ubiquitously in the body,
with higher proportions in heart, liver, kidney, and
pancreas. Although meats and seafood are its dietary
sources, it can be synthesized in the laboratory and there-
fore, can be made available as dietary supplement. CoQ10
is a powerful mitochondrial antioxidant. It can efﬁciently
preserve
epilepsy. Besides, it can protect neuronal cells from striatal
excitotoxic lesions produced by the mitochondrial toxin
(complex II inhibitor) and neurodegenerative disorders
FIGURE 29.4

beneﬁcial effects in neurodegenerative disorders [227,228].
These evidences conﬁrm that nutraceuticals are potent
preservers of mitochondrial functions, and thus are efﬁcient
in ﬁghting against the pathophysiology of neurodegenera-

cleavage,
enhancing clearance of Ab, eventually reducing Ab

such as resveratrol, curcumin, ginsenosides, gallic acid,
etc., are reported to have inhibitory effect on a-synuclein
assembly and concomitant neurotoxicity [232]. Calcium
dyshomeostasis underlies disease progression in AD [233].
Blueberry extract can antagonize increase in intracellular
calcium. It can also prevent aggregated Ab-induced ATP
leakage. These properties of blueberry impart protection to
neurons from calcium-overload-induced neurotoxicity. Not
many reports on calcium-overload antagonizing effect of
nutraceuticals are available [234]. A thorough mechanistic
screening of nutraceuticals for potential inhibitors of
intracellular calcium overloading is required.

genes in Nrf2-dependent manner. Nrf2-antioxidant response
element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling pathway is a potent therapeutic
target for neurodegenerative diseases [198e200,235e237]
(Fig. 29.6A and B). L-Sulforaphane is an isothiocyanate com-
pound found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables.
Studies show that it can inhibit dopamine quinone-induced
neuronal death by reducing the accumulation of ROS, prevent-
ing membrane damage, and DNA fragmentation in dopami-
nergic cell lines and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. L-
Sulforaphane and tert-butylhydroquinone also stimulated Nrf2/
ARE transcriptional pathway against H2O2-induced oxidative
stress in a mixed neuron-astrocyte culture system Nrf2/ARE
pathway and upregulates various antioxidant genes like g-glu-
tamylcysteine ligase (GCL), MnSOD, hemeoxygenase, and
NAD(P)H:quinine reductase. GCL is the rate-limiting enzyme in
the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), an important factor in ROS
scavenging [238,240,241]. Blueberry targets ROS signaling
through CREB and MAP-kinase signaling pathways [236,242]
(Fig. 29.6C). Likewise, curcumin imparted neuroprotection by
decreasing ROS and proapoptotic signaling in mouse models of
encephalitis [180,243]. Carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid also
scavenged ROS to protect neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo

provides
protection by modulating Ab processing and upregulating sirtuin
1, the longevity-linked gene [245]. Similarly, aged garlic extract
was found potent against Ab peptide-induced apoptosis. It sup-
pressed generation of ROS, attenuated caspase-3 activation,
prevented DNA fragmentation, and PARP cleavage [13].
Eugenol, a nutraceutical obtained from cloves, increased GSH
levels and inhibited lipid peroxidation in 6-hydroxydopamine-
treated mouse striatum. This also prevented 6-hydroxydopamine-
induced reduction in dopamine levels [161]. Epidemiological
studies strongly correlate antioxidant-rich foods with reduced risk
of developing PD. However, conclusive clinical trials in support
are yet unavailable [246].
Nutraceuticals targeting neuro-inﬂammation
Phospholipase A2 links prooxidants and proinﬂammatory
cytokines with the release of arachidonic acid and eicosanoid
synthesis. Arachidonic acid and eicosanoid are important
mediators of inﬂammation. Anthocyanins inhibit phos-
pholipase A2 to alleviate neuroinﬂammation [247,248].
Anthocyanins are naturally occurring pigments belonging
to ﬂavonoid group of polyphenols. Anthocyanins are
very common in berries. Blueberries modulated express-
ions of the genes involved in inﬂammation to impart
neuroprotection [249]. Curcumin inhibited inﬂammation by
suppressing NF-kB activation. This also helped in prevent-
ing Ab-induced cell death in a human neuroblastoma cell
line [48]. Green tea ﬂavonoid, epigallocatechin-3-gallate,
and mustard oil glycoside also inhibit proinﬂammatory
signaling through NF-kB or toll-like receptor modulation to
stabilize the blood-brain barrier in MS [250]. Retinoic acid is
a metabolite of vitamin A that can balance T-lymphocyte
populations in peripheral blood, which results in increased
tolerance and decreased inﬂammation. Thus, it is also
anticipated
plasticity,
neural
regeneration,
cognition, and behavior in patients with MS [251]. Vitamins
D and E reduce inﬂammation in patients with MS, PD, and
AD [252]. Vitamin E supplementation also suppressed
neuronal degeneration occurring due to kainic acid-induced
status epilepticus in rat brain. The levels of astrocytic and
microglial antigens (GFAP and MHC II, respectively) and
proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1b and TNF-a were
signiﬁcantly reduced after vitamin E supplementation [253].
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid can target behavioral
dysfunction, hippocampal neuronal loss, inﬂammation,
demyelination, and impulse conductivity. Thus, omega-3
supplementation promoted neurologic recovery in trau-
matic brain injury by attenuating the deleterious effect on
white matter [254,255] (Fig. 29.7).

Nutraceuticals from an evolutionary
Nutraceuticals are surfacing as the future for managing
diseases with challenging epidemiologies. Nutraceuticals or
dietary supplements, as they are now known, do not have
any geographical restrictions, courtesy rapid globalization
of almost everything in modern life. However, nutritional
history of human race shows something interesting:
geographic variations of diets prepare the local populace for
a particular geophysical environment. Conversely, ende-
mism of natural resources shaped the dietary portfolio of
human populations across the world for centuries. The
overall decline in the global food quality owing to rushed
commercialization of the global food market has brought
almost the global population on the same platform. From
here, now, we have started tracing back the secrets of long
and healthy lifespans of our ancestors. Among several
anticipated factors, food habit is emerging to be the most
important one behind this. Therefore, ancient food habits
have been extensively explored in recent years that have
resulted in identiﬁcation of dietary items with very high
medicinal values. Including these items in daily diets as
supplements, regardless of their geographic origin, is
trending as the dietary regimes of wealthy countries. So far,
this chapter provided the readers with a comprehensive
understanding of the role of nutraceuticals in maintaining
overall health of human brain. There are many reports,
reviews, articles, book chapters, and even entire books
dedicated to this topic that has enhanced our general
knowledge and understanding of the functioning of brain
nutraceuticals. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no report that offers the readers a historical
perspective of gradual evolution of nutraceuticals across the
geographical habitats of different human races. Proteomic

and metabolomic proﬁles of a population are the functions
of geographical conditions. So, it is quite possible that
nutraceutical requirements of a given population to ensure
brain health could be quite speciﬁc and spelt out by these
proﬁles. The current section is dedicated toward under-
standing this complex coordination between racial genetic
makeup and their dietary requirements.
Cross-talk between brain and gut
The “gut-brain axis” is a rather new and somewhat unusual
concept connecting brain functions to gut microbiota.
Elderly individuals were found to have altered “gut-brain
axis,” which is believed to be responsible for systemic
inﬂammation in the aging population. Besides, altered
“gut-brain axis” is also indicated as a possible marker for
early onset of frailty in younger population. According to
this concept, probiotic consumption is healthy for gut
positively
inﬂuences
pertaining to behavior and cognition. The authenticity of
this concept has been put to clinical trials for addressing the
relationship between gut microbiota and CNS and psychi-
atric disorders. One such study aims at investigating the
correlation
composition
microbiome,
permeability of intestinal barrier, and systemic inﬂamma-
tion in patients with dementia [261]. The enteric nervous
system can function autonomously and handle reﬂexes in
the absence of CNS input. It communicates with CNS
parasympathetically via vagal nerve and sympathetically
via paravertebral ganglia. In addition, it is susceptible to
neurotrophic and neuromodulatory signaling. Thus, Dr.
Michael Gershon has rightly identiﬁed gut as “the second
brain” [262]. Intestinal ﬂora of an individual is a unique
signature decided by the mode of delivery at birth, genetic
predisposition, age, nutrition, food habits, physical activity,
environmental factors, stress, infections, other diseases, and
the use of antibiotics [263]. Interestingly, the gut micro-
biota inﬂuences CNS through synthesizing molecules
mimicking neuroactive factors like acetylcholine, cate-
cholamine,
g-aminobutyric
(GABA),
histamine,
melatonin, and serotonin [264]. Conversely, emotional and
psychological stress inﬂuences the composition of gut
microbiota, resulting in reduction in benevolent Lactoba-
cilli population and a rise in pathogenic Clostridium species
[265e267]. Therefore, gut-brain axis is inclusive of the
intestinal ﬂora, and hence the term is extended to
“microbiota-gut-brain axis.” The idea of “microbiota-
gut-brain axis” gained popularity since the early 2000s,
following a study reporting an exaggerated hypothalamus-
pituitary axis (HPA) response to stress in germ-free (GF)
mice as compared to normal ones [268]. The gut-brain
communication is maintained by vagus nerve signaling
and speciﬁc bacterial species [269e271]. GF mice lived
signiﬁcantly longer than their normal counterparts. This is
likely to be due to reduced pathological infections. How-
ever, a converse effect is not ruled out, since, aging is
known to adversely affect gut lining like it does to brain
cells. In fact, microbial diversity and stability of intestinal
microﬂora
age
[272,273].
Interestingly,
reduction in brain function and cognitive abilities accom-
panied the age-related loss of intestinal ﬂora [274,275].
Aging leaves its imprints on almost all types of cells, and its
manifestations share common denominators like genomic
instability, epigenetic alterations, and oxidative stress
[276]. Even the gut microbiota is not spared from the
effects of aging: the composition alters, which in turn
affects brain physiology and function. Fecal microbiota
transplantation experiments in rats linked gut microbiota
with depression, anhedonia, and anxiety through modiﬁ-
cations in tryptophan metabolism. This strongly implicated
the role of gut microbiota in neurobehavioral changes
[277]. Metabolization of dietary glutamate through certain
strains of Lactobacillus and Biﬁdobacteria resulted in
dysregulated GABA signaling and concomitant reduction
in anxiety and depression-related comportment in mice
[277].
age-related
alteration
homeostasis led to imbalance between symbionts and
pathobionts. Consequently, intestinal barrier function was
reduced leading to a state of dysbiosis relatable to subse-
quent metabolic and inﬂammatory disorders, visceral pain,
and altered brain functioning [278].
Nutraceuticals, alternatively identiﬁed as food or food
products with medical or health beneﬁts, are essentially
active compounds effective against many diseases [279].
So,
neuro-nutraceuticals
are,
extrapolation,
active
compounds that exert effects on the CNS. Since CNS
health is also a function of intestinal ﬂora, therefore, food
ingredients responsible for maintaining latter are counted in
neuro-nutraceuticals. Some of these might be “non-
digestible food ingredients” like prebiotics that selectively
stimulate the growth of symbionts like Biﬁdobacteria and
Lactobacilli in the colon [280]. Chemically, prebiotics are
fructo-oligosaccharides. They are enzymatically processed
in the colon to generate short-chain fatty acids that
positively impact commensal ﬂora, which help both in
maintaining integrity of epithelial barrier and brain meta-
bolism [281]. Prebiotics lowered triglycerides and choles-
terol levels in blood, which is beneﬁcial for blood-brain
barrier integrity and brain lipid metabolism [280].
The viable microorganisms in the intestine with positive
health effects are called probiotics [282]. Bacterial species
belonging
genii
Lactobacillus,
Biﬁdobacterium,
Escherichia, and Bacillus are the most common probiotics.
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae,
commonly
known
baker’s yeast, is also a probiotic [283]. Probiotics can
modify the gut microbiota and thus directly affect trypto-
phan levels. Tryptophan is a serotonin precursor and hence,
the observed anxiolytic effects of probiotics [261].

Brain and gastronomic evolutions were
simultaneous
Cooking, meat eating, and domestication of plants and
animals have the critical driving forces behind the major
dietary shifts during hominin evolution. Decades of
devoted and exhaustive anthropological research elucidated
that these shifts in dietary history were associated with
major anatomical and cultural changes along hominin
evolution such as the increase in relative brain size and the
advent of modern civilization via agriculture. However, this
reconstruction proved more crucial for understanding the
evolutionary context of our modern diets and the diseases
often associated with them. Changes in food availability
and diet composition during hominin evolution likely
created strong selection pressures on multiple biological
processes that mediated the effect of dietary risk factors for
common diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and
cancer. Morphology of the digestive system has also
adapted to dietary shifts [284].
The gut microbiome shows strong individual speciﬁcity
as a result of genetic polymorphisms introduced by selec-
tion pressures like eating habits, living environment, and
antibiotic usage [285]. In fact, the diversity and stability of
gut symbionts protect us from several diseases like obesity,
cancer and even mental disorders [286,287]. Thus, alter-
ations in the gut microbiome lead to several diseases. Gut
microbiome in normal individuals shows great diversity
due to genetic and environmental factors and of course the
eating habits that give the individual speciﬁc uniqueness
proving the aphorism “We are what we eat.” [288]. Natu-
rally, gut microbiota varies in different countries due to
eating habits, culture and genetic variations reﬂecting racial
in addition to spatial distribution [285,289].
Genome interacts with the environmental factors, such
as diet, through epigenetic changes. This concept was
proposed by the British biologist Conrad Waddington
(1905e1975) in 1942 to describe the interplay between
genes and the environment in determining the phenotype of
an organism. The epigenetic changes are not restricted to
embryonic developmental stage only; rather they are active
throughout the lifetime of an organism. Dietary and other
environmental factors are known to induce epigenetic
changes like DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcations
that not only lasted the lifetime of an individual but also
passed on to the offspring through non-Mendelian inheri-
tance. Evidences
of diet-induced heritable epigenetic
changes have been accumulated [290]. In fact, there are
conclusive evidences that the genes that underwent epige-
netic changes in response to diet had diverged humans from
chimpanzees in the evolutionary tree. The genes directly
affected by dietary changes were under strong selection
pressure, favoring crucial morphological and functional
changes. According to the expensive-tissue hypothesis, a
switch to a high-quality diet allowed a reduced gut size and
an increased brain size driving human evolution [291,292].
Introduction of cooking in the food habits of evolving
humans made this switch possible. A diet of raw food
difﬁcult to digest could not sustain the high-energy
requirements of the human hunteregatherer. Cooking is
believed to have allowed reduction in tooth and jaw sizes,
led to a smaller gut, thereby, creating room for brain
enlargement. Anthropologists noted that cooking was
discovered independently by various human populations
sufﬁciently long ago for the current phenotypes to evolve.
Thus, epigenetic inheritance acted as an engine of evolution
that played an important role in species divergence.
Do nutraceuticals have ethnic biasness when it
comes to their effectivities?
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA), the main components of omega-3 fatty acid, are
particularly found in salmon ﬁsh muscles [293]. Omega-3
fatty acid and PUFAs are associated with decreased chan-
ces of anxiety and depression [294]. Japan is the major
consumer of salmon ﬁsh, which corroborates longer life-
span of Japanese as compared to other ethnicities [295].
But, can people from other ethnicity, with different gastric
proﬁle, digest salmon and get as much beneﬁts as Japa-
nese? Similarly, Asian countries that consume spice are less
prone to develop neurological disorders as compared to the
Western countries. But can the genetic proﬁle of people
from other ethnicities handle the extent of spices used in
Indian food? It is difﬁcult to have case-by-case answer to
these questions. But like the digestive proﬁle, our allergic
proﬁle is also governed by our genetic constitution.
Therefore, it is likely, very likely, that food sources of
nutraceuticals need to be customized to the genetic proﬁle
of the individual’s ethnic background. Lactose intolerance
is a genetic trait shaped by the evolutionary forces that
show ethnic distribution [296].
Mode of nutraceutical consumption: Food
versus dietary supplements
Since, gastronomic proﬁle plays a crucial role in deciding
the nutrition that will ultimately enter the body, therefore,
nutraceuticals taken as food might not be the best option
always. Moreover, digestive proﬁle unique to particular
human race/s as shaped by the natural selection pressure in
the form of food availability (as seen is the case of lactose
intolerance) may pose hindrance in accepting or adapting to
a different food habit, regardless of the richness of that diet
in nutraceuticals. Besides, several cultural, ethical and
religious beliefs are known to affect food habits. For
example, vegetarian populations are restricted from eating
ﬁsh, and thus cannot enjoy the beneﬁt of body receiving

omega-3 directly from the food. For them, cod liver
capsules are alternative option. Thus, consuming isolated
active components from different food items has gained
popularity due to ease of availability and acceptance.
Nutraceuticals work in “groups” on “group of targets”.
So, there is no one-on-one protocol when nutraceuticals are
at work. This teamwork might be required for their intes-
tinal
absorption
subsequent
assimilation
even
performing their functions or a combination of all of these.
Food items are stash pools of nutraceuticals in themselves.
Therefore, when nutraceuticals are consumed as food, the
teamwork is automatically taken care of. However, if
nutraceuticals are taken as isolated active compounds, this
facility will be missing unless a combinatorial prescription
is made. In that case also it is quite unlikely that the natural
composition can be reproduced. So, nutraceuticals in the
form
tablets,
syrups,
etc.,
might
perform
only
suboptimally compared to when taken as food items.
Dietary supplements are generally considered safe.
Dietary supplements can be easily brought to the market
without the support of clinical trials although not totally
without risk. There is a lack of systematic studies of their
adverse effects and so their use is not absolutely free of
risk. Dietary supplements are concentrated or puriﬁed
products, which can achieve higher plasma levels than
respective food sources. These food sources are complex
mixtures of bioactive proteins, peptides, and phytochemi-
cals. High plasma levels can pose health risks as seen in
case of isoﬂavones when taken as dietary supplements. As
an example, cases of endometriosis have been associated
with isoﬂavones [297].
So, it is difﬁcult to preferentially recommend one mode
consumption
other.
Nevertheless,
considering the possible number of permutations and
combinations gone into natural selection of the ﬁttest traits,
it is advisable to adopt food habits compatible with one’s
genetic constitution.
“Let thy food be thy medicine” is the idea behind the
current popularity of nutraceuticals in the Western coun-
tries. Asian food habits have always been based on this
principle. Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of
medicine, in particular emphasizes the overall health of
mind and body through medications in form of food. So,
eating healthy food is not a new concept. Thus, nutra-
ceuticals in form of food is actually a readvent of a tradi-
tional practice recognized worldwide. However, isolating
the active compounds present in the food items and making
them available in concentrated forms is deﬁnitely some-
thing new and more efﬁcient, at least initially; but as
discussed earlier, such pure ingredients might not be as
beneﬁcial as thought to be. Nutraceuticals, when taken as
food, tend to target multiple pathways. Interestingly, these
are major signaling pathways involved in the processes
responsible for many diseases. It is fascinating to observe
how precisely the nutraceuticals can handle multitargeting.
Such precision is difﬁcult to be reproduced through
combinatorial administration of active components isolated
from the same food items.
This chapter has exhaustively reviewed various ethnic
medicinal systems and the nutraceuticals identiﬁed in them
that are involved in maintaining brain health and the
tentative pathways they target. From all these a clear cor-
relation between food habits and the prevalence of neuro-
logical disorders emerges. This has already led to an
unbridled consumption of dietary supplements, which are
actually isolated nutraceuticals from various food items but
supplied in a very concentrated form. Such supplements are
available over the counter, which worsens the situation,
since in general consumption is not correlated to require-
ment. Quite often, the body is left to cope with the over-
loading of such dietary supplements. Being derived from
food items, their possible toxicity never occurs to mind,
which sometimes has been the case. Thus, a strategy needs
to be put in place to reduce unrestrained intake of dietary
supplements. One such approach is, including these sup-
plements under prescription. But, in countries like USA,
with less affordable medical systems, such a measure is
unlikely to be successful. Therefore, alternative strategies,
like, encouraging people to adapt healthier food habits can
be an excellent solution. Such food habits might not be
ethnic to a particular population, nevertheless, they can
always be tempered to enhance their palatability.

Discussion and way forward
Introduction - The brain and the
nervous system
The brain, spinal cord and the nerves, together make up the
nervous system. The nervous system has three main func-
tions - Sensory function (gathering information from both
inside and outside the body), Integration function (trans-
mitting and processing the chemical inputs in the brain and
spine) and Motor function (sending signals to the muscles,
glands and organs to respond appropriately). The nervous
system has two main divisionsdCentral Nervous System
(CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). The CNS
comprises of the brain and spinal cord whereas the PNS
consists of all the nerves that branch out of the brain and
spinal cord. The PNS has two main divisions, the somatic
system that regulates voluntary responses of the body, and
the autonomic system that regulates the involuntary re-
sponses of the body. The autonomic nervous system is
further divided as sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that
promotes emergency response commonly known as ‘ﬁght
of ﬂight’ response, and parasympathetic nervous system
(PSNS) that promotes normal response commonly known
as ‘rest and digest’ response of the nervous system. The
CNS is responsible for cognition, movement, senses, and
emotions. Neurons are the structural and functional units of
the nervous system. There is a network of billions of
neurons in the CNS that transmits and stores information.
There are three basic parts of neuron, the cell body, den-
drites and axon. Dendrites of the neurons receive stimulus
and carry its impulses to the cell body whereas axon ﬁbers
(covered with a dense lipid layer called myelin sheath)
carry the impulses away from the cell body. Neurotrans-
mitters are the chemicals that cross the gap in the synapses
and continue the nerve impulses. The CNS has limited
capacity for self-repair. As it is encased in bony structures
(skull and vertebrae), the accessibility to it is difﬁcult; it
also has a special vascular system that serves as a barrier to
prevent entry of harmful substances. CNS diseases/disor-
ders
diseases,
developmental diseases, and traumatic injuries which result
in permanent functional impairment [1,2].
Brain is one of the largest organs in the body and
majorly comprises of fat. Brain size is generally propor-
tional to the body size but that does not correlate with the
intelligence. The major parts of the brain comprise of the
cerebrum, cerebellum, diencephalon, and brain stem.
Cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain comprising of
about 60% of brain mass and it consists of two hemi-
spheres. The gray matter (cerebral cortex) comprises of the
cell bodies and synapses but no myelin and the folded
bulges of the cortex (gyri). The white matter (medullary
body) consists of the myelinated axons. Cerebrum is

responsible for emotions, thoughts, creativity, communi-
cation, planning. Cerebellum coordinates movements and
balance. Diencephalon (Epithalamus, Thalamus, Hypo-
thalamus) manages internal environment, moods, memory,
regulates pituitary gland and sleep. Brain Stem (Midbrain,
Pons, Medulla), the smallest region, manages the basic
bodily functionsdvegetative functions and involuntary
responses.
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are the most important
molecules that help in maintaining the integrity and
functioning of the brain. EFAs, especially the omega-3
fatty acids, are important for brain development during
the gestation as well as postnatal period. EFAs cannot be
synthesized by the body and hence are to be obtained from
dietary sources, deﬁciency of which can lead to impaired
brain performance and diseases. As EFAs are involved in
the synthesis and functions of brain neurotransmitters, and
in the molecules of the immune system their continuous
bioavailability
throughout
life
span
desired.
Neuronal membranes contain phospholipids that helps in
the synthesis of speciﬁc lipid messengers on neuronal
stimulation or injury, which in turn participate in signaling
cascades that can either promote neuronal injury or neu-
roprotection. Myelin has a much higher lipid content
about 80% t compared to white matter where it’s about
60% and gray matter where it’s about 40%. Myelin
contains higher cerebroside’ cerebroside sulfate and
cholesterol, and lower ethanolamine glycerophosphatides
and choline glycerophosphatides than gray matter. Serine
glycerophosphatides and sphingomyelin are about the
same in each tissue. The extra-myelin portion of white
matter has lipid composition that is similar to myelin, but
different from gray matter. The molar ratio of protein
amino acids to polar lipids in myelin is approx. 2.38 to 1.
Brain uses about 20% of the total blood and 20% of the
total oxygen that is circulating through the body at any
given time. If blood supply to the brain is cut off for more
than 8e10 s, it can lead to unconsciousness, however the
human brain can survive for about 5 to 6 minutes without
oxygen [3,4].
Ayurvedic perspective of the nervous
systemdMajja dhatu and Majjavaha
srotas
According to Ayurveda “srotamayam hi shariram” means
the whole body is composed of channels. Srota refers to
macro and micro channels of circulation in the body
through which the basic building elements of the body
(dosha, dhatu, and mala) circulate. Dosha regulates all
physiological functions of the body and dhatu provides the
nourishment to the body, while mala are the waste matter
of the body metabolism. Charaka explains thirteen srota as
depicted in Table 30.1. Seven srota for dhatu i.e. rasa (life
sap or plasma), rakta (blood), mansa (muscle), meda (fatty
tissues), asthi (bones), majja (bone marrow and nervous
tissues) and shukra (semen or regenerative tissues). Three
srota for mala, i.e. mutra (urine), purisha (faecal matter),
and sweda (sweat). Three srota for prana (life forces),
anna (food) and jala (water). Hence Srota are responsible
for movement of bodily humors, nourishment of body
tissues and purity in psychological feelings. Dushti
(impairment) in these channels cause derangements and is
responsible for various physiological and neurological
disabilities. Srota are considered as modiﬁcation of the
Panchamahabhoota in which different elements undergo
transformation,
transmutation,
circulation
trans-
portation. The human body is an expression of Pan-
chmahabhoota (ﬁve great elements) that includes ﬁve
basic elements of nature, earth, water, ﬁre, space and sky.
Their combination and proportion determine the prakriti
(constitution) of the individual that is referred as the dosha
type as Vata (air and ether), Pitta (ﬁre and water) and
Kapha (water and earth). In Ayurveda, the majja dhatu is
considered as an unctuous part present in the bone casing.
It is associated both with the bone marrow which is pre-
sent inside the bones and the nervous system comprising
of the brain in the skull casing and spinal cord in the
vertebrae. s Majja originates from its previous dhatu-meda
(fatty tissues) and it is formed from ahara rasa (the
essence of food). The quality and quantity of ahara rasa
thus determines the quality and quantity of majja dhatu.
Majjavaha srota are channels that carry the nutrients to
the bone marrow and nervous system. The marga (channel
of inﬂuence) of majjavaha srota is suggested to be central,
sympathetic, and parasympathetic nervous system while
the mukha (origin of inﬂuence) of majjavaha srota is
suggested to be considered as the synaptic spaces.
Constitution of majja dhatu has a predominance of jala
mahabhuta (water element) and has kapha like charac-
teristics however for proper formation and functioning of
the majja dhatu, air and water should be in balance. The
balance of air helps regulate the ﬂow of nerve impulses
and water helps provide a counter balance to air hence
protecting the nerve against excessive motion and agita-
tion. The food that provokes vata generally leads to poor
formation of majja dhatu and hence is responsible for
various neurological and degenerative disorders. Vitiation
of pitta leads to inﬂammation and over a long period of
time can burn out the myelin and nerve tissue. Vitiation of
kapha may slow down nerve conduction, decrease the rate
of processing information and cause blockages resulting in
the aberrant ﬂow of nerve impulses. The depletion of

majja dhatu known as majja kshaya, with aging, can be
the cause of various neurological disorders hence affecting
the intellectual and psychological status of a person [5e8].
Brain patterns and Dosha type
Dosha plays an important role in determining the quality of
dhatu and hence the brain pattern. All the seven dhatu of
the body contains their own ﬁre (agni) for metabolizing the
nutrients supplied through srota. The state of agni
determines the quantity and quality of the tissues that are
formed. The health of the majja dhatu is dependent upon
the state of the majjagni (one of the seven tissue ﬁres called
dhatvagni). Majjagni resides within the majja dhara kala
(the membranes or layers in the body). Inﬁltration of the
kala by vata dosha, makes the agni variable, inﬁltration of
the kala by kapha dosha lowers the agni, and inﬁltration of
the kala by pitta dosha, leads to increased agni Variable
agni results in irregular tissue formation and the tissue is
very fragile. Movement of prana is irregular and may result
in hyperactivity or hypoactivity. Jerky motions and tremors
are also co related with this. Aggravated vata dosha may
result in drying and thinning of the nervous tissues.
Low agni may result in excessive tissue formation of low
quality making the majja dhatu denser and thicker which in
turn leads to slow movement of nerve impulses (prana),
slow processing of sensory information and slow response
times. When kapha dosha increase further it may block the
ﬂow prana entirely. Increased agni may result in minimal
to moderate tissue formation that may be very efﬁcient
which in turn leads to the effective movement of prana
through the nervous system with faster processing and
response time. When pitta dosha increases too much, the
tissue formed become prone to inﬂammation and exces-
sive metabolism which may lead to deterioration of the
myelin sheath and disturbance of neurological structures.
This may occur in some cases of Parkinson’s disease and

Vata dosha brain pattern is associated with a great range
of functioning of the brain and nervous system; it is
characterized by highly variable behavior. People with this
type exhibit high range of prefrontal functioning, get
overstimulated easily, like multitasking, tend to learn and
forget quickly. They can give creative solutions to problem
solving but have trouble sleeping soundly. Due to high
sympathetic nervous system activation, the peripheral
blood ﬂow is less that leads to cold limbs. They are very
sensitive to pain and cold temperatures. They have a high
range of digestive power leading to an irregular appetite
and bowel movements. Their limbic system is highly
sensitive to changes in the environment. Their emotions are
highly variable, they can have excessive fear and phobias.
Their hypothalamus is constantly changing the state of the
mind and body. Pitta dosha brain pattern is associated with
fast, passionate responses of the brain and it is character-
ized by dynamism. The sympathetic response turns on to a
high level and then returns to resting levels again. People
with this type have their autonomic response tied to
purposeful goal-oriented behavior, where it turns on to
reach the goal and then turns off. They have strong
digestion and frequent bowel movements. Their hypothal-
amus has a strong on and off switch and it maintains a
higher core body temperature and dynamic mental and
physical activity. When Pitta dosha becomes excessive it
can lead to irritability and anger. Kapha dosha brain pattern
has stable activity pattern of the brain and nervous system
and is characterized by steadiness. People with this type
have high parasympathetic response and have methodical
thinking and action. They prefer routine and need stimu-
lation to get going. The sympathetic response is not easily
evoked in them. They are calm, easy going, not easily
perturbed, always smiling, and rarely in a hurry. They are
sensitive to cold and dampness. The hypothalamus main-
tains a slower metabolism rate [9e11].
Brain agingdModern and Ayurvedic
The brain undergoes continuous structural and functional
changes from conception to old age, more than any other
part of the body. The brain development starts early in the
life of a foetus, and it grows at a rate of about a quarter
million neurons per minute in the ﬁrst trimester. After birth
during ﬁrst few weeks, the brain volume is about 35% of
adult volume and almost doubles during the ﬁrst year, and
increases to 15% to 80% of the adult size in subsequent
years. The amount of brain stimulation a child receives can
affect brain growth by almost 25%. During the ﬁrst few
years of life, more than one million new neural connections
are formed every second and the size of the brain increases
fourfold at 3e5 years. It reaches around 90% of adult
volume by the age of 6 years, though the brain growth
continues till 18 years of age. Grey and white matter have
different growth trajectories. The frontal lobes, responsible
executive
functions,
planning,
working
memory, and impulse control, are among the last areas of
the brain that mature, and they may not be fully developed
until the age of 30e35 years. The sensation-seeking trait
(dopamine levels) develops during adolescence. Impul-
sivity and sensation-seeking have different trajectories of
development from age 12 to 24 [12,13].
In Ayurveda, aging is known as Jara. It is deﬁned as
that which becomes old by the act of wearing out, jiryati iti
jara; it is synonymous with vardhakya meaning increasing
age. Ayurveda divides human life into childhood up to the
age 16 years; youth and middle age, from 16 to 60 years
(Charaka) or 70 years (Sushruta) and exhibits progres-
sively the traits of growth vivardhamana (16e20 years of
age), youth youvana (20e30 years), maturity sampoornata
(30e40 years), deterioration parihani (40 years onwards
which gradually sets in up to 60 years); old age, wherein
60e70 years
body elements, sense
organs,
strength, and so forth begin to decay. While describing
aging, Ayurveda takes in consideration Prana (life energy
that performs respiration, oxygenation, and circulation). It
governs two other subtle essence ojas and tejas. Ojas (the
essence of the seven dhatus or bodily tissues) is responsible
for the autoimmune system and mental intelligence; it is
necessary for longevity. Displaced ojas creates the kapha-
related disorders and decreased ojas creates vata-related
reactions. Tejas (the essence of a very subtle ﬁre or energy)
governs metabolism through the enzyme system. Agni
(central ﬁre or energy source in the body) promotes
digestion, absorption, and assimilation of food. Tejas is
necessary for the nourishing and transformation of each
dhatu. Aggravated tejas burns away ojas reducing immu-
nity and overstimulating pranic activity. Aggravated prana
produces degenerative disorders in the dhatus. Lack of tejas
results in overproduction of unhealthy tissue and obstructs
the ﬂow of pranic energy. Just as it is essential to maintain
balance among the tridoshadvata, pitta, kapha principles
of motion, metabolism, structure, respectively, the dhatus
and the three malas (bodily wastes); it is important for
maintenance of health and longevity that prana, ojas, and
tejas remain in balance. The tridosha play a very important
role in the maintenance of cellular health and longevity.
Kapha maintains longevity on the cellular level. Pitta
governs digestion and nutrition. Vata, which is closely
related to pranic life energy, governs all life functions.
Proper diet, exercise, and lifestyle can create a balance
among these three subtle essences [6,14].
The dosha, dhatu and mala constitute the basis of the
physiological and pathological doctrines of Ayurveda and
body can function normally when they are balanced and in
equilibrium. The diminishing agni in older age leads to


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 460

decrease in quantity and quality of all dhatus. Pathologies
of the nervous system are termed vatavyadhi such as pain
and alterations of motion. On a psychological level, when
majjadhatu is healthy, there is a sense of fullness and
completion; when deﬁcient, there exists a feeling of
emptiness; and in excess, there is the feeling of stagnation
and lack of motivation. According to Charaka, factors that
lead to vitiation of majjavaha srotas include virrudha
ahara (eating wrong combinations of food), lack of sleep,
stress, fractures, suppressed emotions, etc. The symptoms
of vitiation include lack of stability and equilibrium, loss of
memory, anxiety, ringing ears and dark circles around the
eyes, talk disorder as stuttering, and the associated diseases
could be Bell palsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s dis-
ease etc. According to Ayurveda, the process of brain aging
begins in the fourth decade of life, which includes neuro-
degeneration. The contemporary biosciences also register
similar views on brain aging considering it an inevitable
phenomenon. The weight and volume of the brain de-
creases by 5% between ages 30 and 70 years, by 10% by
the age 80 years and by 20% by the age of 90 years. With
aging degenerative changes like physiological disturbances
of neurotransmitter secretions, blunting of dendrites and
synapses and formation of beta amyloidal plaques occur;
this process of neurodegeneration when enhanced can lead
to AD and other types of dementia [12,15].
Due to aging, the brain size, vasculature, and cognition
change, and there are changes in levels of neurotransmitters
and hormones. Incidence of stroke, white matter lesions,
and dementia also rises. The shrinking of the gray matter,
decrease in dendritic synapses, decrease in white matter,
deterioration of myelin sheath after the age of 40 is most
common. Brain changes do not occur to the same extent in
all brain regions, the frontal lobes are most affected by
white matter lesions, the prefrontal cortex is most affected
and the occipital least. This correlates with the cognitive
changes seen in aging. The frontal and temporal lobes are
most affected in men as are the hippocampus and parietal
lobes in women. Mapping structure to function and change
because of aging is a complex task; however, there are
studies that show links between volume and neuropsy-
chological function where association between increasing
age, a reduction in prefrontal cortical volume, increased
subcortical white matter lesions, and an increase in
perseverative behavior were seen. The most common
cognitive change associated with aging is that of memory.
Memory function can be broadly divided into four sections,
episodic memory, semantic memory, procedural memory,
and working memory. The ﬁrst two of these are most
important with regard to aging. Episodic memory is deﬁned
as ‘‘a form of memory in which information is stored with
‘mental tags’, about where, when and how the information
was picked up.” Episodic memory starts declining from
middle age and is associated with memory loss seen in AD.
Semantic memory deﬁned as ‘‘memory for meanings’’ also
declines from middle age leading to slower reaction times,
lower attentional levels, and slower processing speeds.
According to Ayurvedic pathophysiology majority neuro-
degenerative disorders may be a result of Beeja Dosha
(genetic factor), Ahara Dosha (deprived diet), Agni Dushti
(digestive ﬁre disturbance), Medha (cognition) problems

Table 30.2 summarizes the neurological diseases and dis-
orders [12,15e17].
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
AD is the most common subtype of dementia (a disorder in
which mental functions deteriorate and breakdown), fol-
lowed by vascular dementia, mixed dementia, and dementia
with Lewy bodies. By 2050 an estimated 135 million
people worldwide will have dementia. According to the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,
AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that occurs
when nerve cells in the brain die. The disease often results
in impaired memory, thinking, and behavior, confusion,
restless, impaired judgment, impaired communication.
Brains affected by AD often show presence of neuroﬁ-
brillary tangles and neuritic plaques. There is reduced
certain
chemicals
necessary
communication between nerve cells, especially acetylcho-
line, norepinephrine, serotonin, and somatostatin. The
National Institute on Aging enumerates the suspected
causes are age and family history, certain genes, abnormal
protein (amyloid b-protein (Ab)) deposits in the brain,
environmental
immune
problems
[17,18].
As per Ayurveda, mind, body, and soul should be in
perfect synchronization for overall health. A balanced
and coordination of atma
(soul),
indriya
(cognitive organs), manah (psyche), and indriyartha (sense
organs) governs the learning process; functioning of these
in turn is governed by a balance of tridosha (vata, pitta,
kapha) and triguna (sattva, raja, tama). Vata regulates the
functioning of the buddhi (intellect), cognitive organs and
psyche. Pitta enhances intellect; and Kapha nurtures dhee
(intelligence), dhriti (fortitude), and smriti (memory). Any
disturbance in tridosha and triguna can disturb the func-
tioning of cognitive organs, psyche and intellect that can
result in impaired memory. The progressive gradual decline
of memory, judgment, and daily functioning describes AD
that ﬁnally leads to loss of bodily functions and ultimately
death. The cause and mechanism for AD is explained
through the concept of smritibhramsha (disturbed mem-
ory). This condition arise due to the depletion of dhatus and


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 461

imbalance of vata dosha which arises due to consumption
of diet dominant in tamas (obscurity) and rajas (passion),
and irregular physical activities that affect the mind and
body. The concept of beeja dosha (genetic defects)
explains the genetic causes due to vitiated doshas. The
vitiation of vata dosha is mainly caused due to tissue
wasting (dhatukshaya) and obstruction of the channels
(margavarodha). Margavarodha is caused by the forma-
tion of ama (accumulation of waste or toxins) due to
improper digestion of food or defective process of meta-
bolism. It’s associated with protein aggregation that dis-
turbs the equilibrium and ﬁnally leads to degenerative
changes and AD. This degeneration further vitiates Vata
and results in a repetitive circle of degenerative events. The
concept of pranaavrita samana is explained as difﬁculty in
speech, slurred speech, and dumbness. The concept of vital
forces of life is explained in terms of ﬁve types of life force
viz. Prana vayu (inward moving energy), Apana vayu
(outward moving energy), Udana vayu (energy of head and
throat), Vyana vayu (circulation of energy) and Samana
vayu (digestion and assimilation). If vyana vata is occluded
by prana vata, then there can be memory loss as well as
loss of strength. According to Charaka there are eight
factors for improving smriti; nimitta (knowledge of cause
and effect), rupagrahanth (knowledge of form), saadra-
shya (knowledge of similarity), saviparyayat (knowledge
contrast),
sattvanubandha
(knowledge
mind),
abhyasa (repetition), jnana yoga (attainment of meta-
physical knowledge), and punahshrutat (subsequent partial
communication) [16e19].
Parkinson’s disease (PD)
PD is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by a
large number of motor and nonmotor features described
under the acronym TRAP: Tremor at rest (trembling in
hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face), Rigidity (stiffness of the
limbs and trunk), Akinesia (or bradykinesiaeslowness of
movement), and Postural instability (or impaired balance
and coordination). In addition, ﬂexed posture and freezing
(motor blocks) is included. According to the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD belongs
to a group of conditions called motor system disorders,
which are the result of the loss of dopamine-producing
brain cells. PD generally affects people over the age of
60, and it affects men and women equally. Depression,
difﬁculty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking, urinary
problems, constipation, skin problems, and sleep disrup-
tions are the other associated symptoms. In PD there is loss
of the nerve endings that produce norepinephrine, the main
chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system,
which controls many automatic functions of the body, such

as heart rate and blood pressure. The brain cells also
contain Lewy bodies and unusual clumps of the protein
alpha-synuclein. There are studies being done to understand
the functions of alpha-synuclein, its relationship to genetic
mutations that impact PD and lewy body dementia [20,21].
In Ayurvedic literature PD and similar conditions are
referred by various names, viz., kampavata (tremors due to
vata), vepathu (generalized involuntary movements of all
parts of the body or of the head), prevepana (excessive
shaking), sirakkampa (head tremor), spandin (quivering),
and kampana (tremors). PD is generally referred as kam-
pavata, which is associated with vata disturbances, which
results in vitiation of rasa dhatu. The pathogenesis involves
dry skin; further vitiated vata affects meda and majja
dhatus, which block channels and lead to stiffness, rigidity
of muscles, and tremors. As the age advances the sanchaya
(accumulation) of apana vayu occurs, which leads to con-
stipation and when this combines with vata it results in
vyana vayu disturbance in rasa dhatu, leading to dryness of
the body membranes. Vitiated vata relocates to any dhatu
that is weak; in this case it’s the degenerative tissue of the
brain. Vayu (prana, samana, and vyana) in the majja dhatu
results in the damage of brain portions that lead to altered
coordination and tremors whereas vyana vayu in mamsa
dhatu causes rigidity and diminishes the vital force of life
leading to depression. Disturbed vata dries out kapha
(cellular structure) in majja dhatu that creates an open
space for entrance of vitiated vata. Though the condition
has majorly vata pathology, pitta may also contribute as its
excessive heat can burn the cellular structure causing
diminished kapha (kapha kshaya) in the majja dhatu and
can initiate neurological disturbances [22,23].
Autism (ASD)
ASD is a commonly used term for a class of neuro-
developmental disorders characterized by a triad of deﬁcits
social
reciprocity,
verbal
nonverbal
communication,
repetitive
restricted
patterns
behavior. Other features generally seen in autistic children
are obsessive behavior, reduced muscle tone, compromised
digestive system. Onset of ASD occurs during the ﬁrst
3 years of life and has an approximate ratio of ﬁve males to
one female. Around 20%e30% of people with ASD have
epilepsy and about 50% have intellectual disability. Its
pathogenesis commences at a very early age, during
embryonic development. The reasons for ASD include
genetic
basis,
gastrointestinal
pathology,
autoimmune
complications, inﬂammation, extreme oxidative stress, and
decreased ability of the body to detoxify toxins [24,25].
Autism is the world’s third most common develop-
mental disorder. In Ayurveda it’s nearest similarity exists
with unmada (insanity). The clinical features of autism ﬁnd
some similarity with the lakshanas (features) described in
unmada due to the vitiation in vata. The causes of autism
deﬁned are genetic factors (beeja dosha), pre and postnatal
insult to brain, diet (ahara dosha), digestive tract changes,
and poisoning (dushi visha). It is the result of khavaigunya
(divergence in channels); further vitiated doshas may
exacerbate
khavaigunya.
Prajnaparadha
(actions
against one’s self-conscious) at various stages of pregnancy
by the pregnant mother is another cause which may lead to
manovikara (dysfunction of mind) in the neonate and may
result in ASD. In the fourth month of pregnancy, the fetus
heart (the seat of consciousness) becomes active, and
expresses its desires through the mother, which if not
honored, may lead to various physical and psychological
abnormalities. To avoid complications like prolonged
delivery, injury to fetal skull, hypoxia, and asphyxia which
may vitiate vata dosha, enough precautions should be taken
during delivery and neonatal period. Diminished ojas is the
result of manovaha srotas dushti that leads to poor
immunity, infections, and uncommon behavioral symp-
toms. If agni is corrected it ensures detoxiﬁcation, facili-
tates proper nutrition to dhatus, proper functioning of
manovaha srotas, and formation of ojas [26].
Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD)
ADHD is a behavioral disorder of children that is charac-
terized by inattention, increased distractibility and difﬁculty
in sustaining attention, poor impulse control, and decreased
self-inhibitory capacity, as well as motor overactivity and
motor restlessness. About two to four times more boys are
affected than girls. The children with ADHD have slower
reaction times or attention span than the general population,
for which a weak or underdeveloped cerebellum is majorly
responsible as the cerebellum is related to making quick
responses. Childhood ADHD is a vata-dominant disease of
manovaha srota wherein vyana-vayu is occluded by prana-
vayu and then there is loss of all the senses, loss of memory,
as well as strength. It may also result from Beej Dushti
(genetic deformity) during conception or Garbhaja Kaar-
anas (causes in the prenatal period) [27]. National Institute
of Mental Health (NIMH) and National Institutes of Health
(NIH) suggests that ADHD may be caused by interactions
between genes and environmental or nongenetic factors,
cigarette smoking, alcohol use, drug use during pregnancy,
exposure to environmental toxins, low birth weight, and
brain injuries [28].
In Ayurveda, the characteristics of ADHD can be
correlated with the abnormal presentations that are man-
ifested due to disturbances in the normal functions of
manahddhee, dhriti, smriti, vibramsha. Mana is respon-
sible for indriyabhigraha (control of sense organs), svani-
grahah (self-control), uhya (hypothetical thinking), and
vichara (analytical thinking). Dhee (knowledge of judging


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 463

correctly), dhriti (controls manah) and smriti (memory
power) are the three main faculties which enable the mind
to work at its best; in contrary, in the absence of the same,
mind fails to make the right decision. This situation of mind
is called as dhee, dhriti, and smriti vibramsha and ﬁnally
resulting in manasika vikaras (improper functioning of
mana) like kama (passion), krodha (anger), lobha (greed),
moha (infatuation), irshya (grief), mada (arrogance). Due
to this the manah loses its capacity of concentration,
attention, and learning as observed in ADHD. Hyperac-
tivity includes restlessness, uneasiness and nervousness in
behavior frequently on every day and every time. In
Ayurveda, this is referred as cheshta (conduct or behaviour)
that is executed by vyana vayu (one of the ﬁve divisions of
life force that empowers the distribution and communica-
tion system of the body) and the vitiated vyana vayu leads
to abnormal, improper, and unsteady activities manifested
in the form of hyperactivity and impulsivity (kayacheshta
and vakcheshta) [29].
Neuroprotective and regenerative strategies
Today many people are turning to the alternative and
complementary medical sciences, especially Ayurveda, in
search of solution for the problems for which modern
medicine has not been able to provide a solution or cure.
Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine that
advocates the use of medicinal plants and has customized
treatment approaches can provide important leads for new
treatments and can result in improved clinical outcomes, if
investigated by well-designed long-term studies. As dis-
cussed previously in this chapter, Ayurveda understands the
nature of human brain in a completely different manner
from modern day’s psychiatric and physiological theories;
hence it can offer newer ways for prevention and man-
agement of neurodegenerative disorders and diseases. The
procedures by which dhatus are brought into equilibrium
condition is called chikitsa; this further includes the
processes for expulsion of vitiated doshas from the body
(shodhana) and the treatment with drugs that bring
normalcy of doshas (shamana). Yuktivyapashraya chikitsa
encompasses herbal supplementation, yoga, panchakarma
and usage of speciﬁc and controlled diet that can help in
preventing or resolving the health condition of the patient.
To correct, the imbalance in the metabolic ﬁre (agnivikara)
the hypo functioning of the digestive ﬁre is corrected by
application of appetizers (deepana dravya). Panchkarma
therapy, the protocol for removing toxins from the system,
to nourish and to energize the cells is also helpful. Yoga
therapy that includes pranayam (breathing technique),
Asanas (postures), and Mudras (relaxation and meditation)
help in promoting the physiological and psychological
processes that calm the state of mind and improve sensory
responses, attention, and immunity. As preventive therapy
regimen for pregnant women (Garbhiniparicharya) is of
major importance. The concept of vayasthapana in Ayur-
veda deals with preserving the youthfulness of a body
irrespective of its age and restricting progression toward
senescence, along with enhancement of longevity, intellect,
physical
mental
strengths,
diseases. Rasayana tantra, one of the eight branches of
Ayurveda,
dedicated
rejuvenation,
regeneration,
immunomodulation, and healthy aging. The scope of
rasayana therapy is not restricted to herbs or formulations
alone, but includes nonpharmacological interventions life-
style interventions, panchkarma therapies, and personal
and social behavioral conduct too. All these measures that
assist in the maintenance of healthy body tissues. The major
being kutipraveshik rasayana (Ayurvedic
therapy
rejuvenation that is carried out while staying in isolation in
a specially constructed cottage) and achara Rasayana
(Ayurvedic strategy for regulating the behavioral social
conduct, which ensures a healthy life in a healthy society).
As per Ayurveda there is a natural dominance of vata dosha
in old individuals hence vata-dominant diseases are
expected more. The degenerative and debilitating diseases

PD,

seen
populations.
Application
medhyarasayana
(CNS
rejuvenators) to restore the body’s harmony and improve
the balance between brain and nervous system has been
widely used. It can help reduce the progression of diseases,
strengthen the sense organs, increase the digestive power
and provide a better quality of life. The most commonly
suggested herbs include mandukaparni, brahmi, sankh-
pushpi,
guduchi
enhancers.
Ethno-
pharmacology and natural product drug discovery remain a
signiﬁcant hope in the current scenario. Considerable
research on pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and
clinical therapeutics has been carried out on Ayurvedic
medicinal plants. Several preclinical and clinical studies
have examined cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, and
immunoadjuvant potential of Ayurvedic medicines. The
ethnopharmacology knowledge, its holistic and systems
approach supported by experiential base can serve as an
innovative and powerful discovery engine for newer, safer,
and affordable medicines [6,30,31].
Neuronutrients (Medhyarasayana)
Medhyarasayana refers to Ayurvedic drugs that are used to
help improve memory and cognitive functions, while pro-
moting intellect (medhya). Medhyarasayana are exten-
sively used for the ailments of mental and cognitive
disorders, as they correcting the dhatus (tissues), there by
normalizing their functions and prevent the early aging
process. It helps in improvement of mental faculties dhee,
dhriti, smriti and gives resistance against diseases. Shod-
hana (puriﬁcation therapies) acts at the level of doshas but


<!-- chunk -->

## Page 464

rasayana acts at the level of dhatus or at subcellular level.
When severe vitiation of dhatus leads to neurodegeneration
such as AD, rasayana chikitsa is very helpful. The mech-
anism of action of rasayana includes nourishment and
maintenance of cell, new cell growth, immunomodulatory
action, antioxidant action, and preserving the balance
between mind and body. Allopathic treatment for PD
includes the drugs supplying the brain with L-DOPA to
increase
striatal
precursor-
substitution and/or reduce its breakdown but higher doses
can cause motor complications of dyskinesia and dystonia
and compromise medical treatment. The seeds of Mucuna
pruriens (atmagupta or kapikachhu) used in Ayurvedic
medicine to manage neurodegenerative diseases like PD are
mentioned as the natural source of levodopa that is
converted to dopamine in the brain. Some clinical studies
suggest pharmacokinetic proﬁle of this natural form distinct
from synthetic levodopa, which is likely to reduce the
untoward motor complications. It has also shown some
neuroprotective beneﬁts, which are unrelated to levodopa.
Withania
somnifera
Curcuma
longa
commonly mentioned medicinal plants in management of
PD that have directionally shown promising results. For the
management of ADHD, trials with Brahmi (Bacopa
monnieri) and Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) have
shown
some
positive
cognition,
memory-
enhancing effect, nootropic effect, anxiolytic and antide-
pressant activity. Apart from Brahmi and Ashwagandha
Mandukaparni, Shankhapushpi, Madhuyashti, Jatamansi,
Jyotishmati, and Guduchi are considered as potential herbs
that can help to improve the brain functions, the sensory
and motor functions, and ultimately can help in the man-
agement of various cognitive disorders by restoring the
balance in tridosha and triguna [32e34].
Ayurveda suggests the use of brahmi, Bacopa monnieri
(family: Scrophulariaceae) in different mental conditions
and various studies have documented its potential for
improvising memory and learning abilities, and symptom-
atic relief to AD patients. In children with ADHD im-
provements in sentence repetition, logical memory, and
paired associate learning tasks have been reported. To
obtain the scientiﬁc evidence whether brahmi can enhance
cognitive performance in humans the scientiﬁc testing
through various randomized controlled human clinical
trials, is being undertaken. Recent reviews indicate that
trials
adults
adolescents
show
improvements in memory, attention, cognition, and mood.
Whereas in children increased exploratory drive, improved
perceptual images of patterns and organization, and
reasoning ability has been indicated. Various preclinical
research studies have demonstrated various central nervous
system actions of brahmi including antioxidant, antide-
pressant, and nootropic effects; along with direct and
indirect
links
dopamine,
serotonin,
noradrenaline, and acetylcholine neurotransmitters. The
main active constituents of brahmi includes brahmine,
herpestine, nicotine,
hersaponin,
monnierin.
nootropic effects are proposed to be associated with the
presence of bacosides A and B where bacosides possess
enhanced
defense
memory-
enhancement activity. The mechanisms of action appear
to act on the CNS and can modulate cholinergic densities,
acetylcholine levels and has b-amyloid scavenging prop-
erties. Some clinical studies suggest that the treatment with
brahmi continuously for about 6 months or more and its
evaluation on various neuropsychological parameters may
give beneﬁcial effect in improving memory and attention
span, decreasing the rate of forgetting of newly acquired
information and associated behavioral problems among the
aged suffering from dementia, AD [35e37].
In India, mandukaparni or gotu kola, Centella asiatica
(family: Apiaceae/Mackinlayoideae) is popularly known as
a brain food. It is a tropical medicinal plant native to
Southeast Asian countries, and it is one of the best herbs
known for anti aging properties due to its antioxidative
effects. It’s possesses neurotonic effects, improves memory
and stimulus reﬂex. Various reviews on scientiﬁc studies
pertaining to gotu kola indicate its role to protect against
neurodegenerative diseases in animal models. Multiple
studies have suggested the effectiveness of gotu kola
extract in preventing oxidation of proteins, lipid peroxida-
tion, and pro-oxidant processes due to its neuroprotective
activity and it is found to be helpful in PD. Some research
study results with C. asiatica indicate a correlation and
neural basis between improved learning capacity and
increased dendritic arborization in amygdaloidal nucleus.
Its postulated that the components in Centella extract, such
as asiatic acid, asiaticosides, polyphenolic compounds may
be helpful for accelerating repair of damaged neurons by
their antioxidant and anti inﬂammatory, and therefore may
be effective in preventing the cognitive deﬁcits, as well as
the oxidative stress [38e40].
Some recent reviews suggest about 54 Convolvulaceae
species to display CNS efﬁcacies historically, about 46
species that have been evaluated for their CNS efﬁcacies
and about 67 compounds from 16 Convolvulaceae species
are suggested to possess CNS efﬁcacies. Ayurvedic
practitioners ﬁnd the use of Shankhapushpi (Convolvulus
pluricaulis) to be helpful in increasing acquisition efﬁ-
ciency of the brain. Its scientiﬁc potential in CNS
depression, anxiolytic, tranquilizing, antidepressant, anti-
neurodegenerative,
antioxidant,
hypolipidemic,
immunomodulatory, analgesic, anti fungal, antibacterial,
anti diabetic, anti ulcer, anti-catatonic, and cardiovascular
activity has been found to be promising and the plants are
reported to contain several types of alkaloids, ﬂavonoids,
and coumarins as active chemicals that bring about their
biological effects [41e43].

Madhuyashti or liquorice, Glycyrrhiza glabra (family:
Fabaceae) is a traditional medicinal plant used in various
ancient medicine systems and documented across the globe
for its ethnopharmacological value to cure varieties of
ailments. The central cholinergic pathways play a promi-
nent role in the learning and memory processes. Acetyl-
cholinesterase is an enzyme that inactivates acetylcholine.
The extract of G. glabra has been proposed to show
acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity. Glycyrrhizin the
major active constituent obtained from liquorice roots, is
one of the most widely used in herbal preparations for the
treatment and management of chronic diseases. Several
studies have been reported for the beneﬁcial effects of G.
glabra in co morbidities associated with CNS. High
phenolic content compounds present in G. glabra are
thought to be responsible for its strong antioxidant activity
and some studies have reported that liquorice ﬂavonoids
have 100 times strong antioxidant activity when compared
with antioxidant activity of vitamin E. G. glabra is known
to possess and show promising effect as a memory-
enhancing agent on learning and memory and also have
anti-depressant and anti-stress activity. Anti depressant-like
effect of liquorice extract is generally attributed to the
restoration of brain monoamines, like norepinephrine and
dopamine levels [44,45]. Jatamansi, Nordostachys jata-
mansi (family: Valerianaceae) has been traditionally used
for management of neuro psychiatric disorders and few
researches show its protecting action against chronic stress-
induced impairments in hippocampus-dependent spatial
learning and memory. Jatamansi causes an overall increase
in the levels of central monoamines and inhibitory amino
acids and has been found to have strong antioxidant activity
[46,47].
Since time immemorial, a traditional ayurvedic herb
called Jyotishmati Celastrus paniculatus, a has been used
to address cognitive deﬁcits in mentally retarded children.
Jyotishmati has been reported to have neuroprotective
and antioxidant activities. It’s seed oil may produce anti-
depressant
receptors, serotonergic and GABA receptors, and hence
may serve as an aid to help increasing the levels of brain
dopamine and serotonin, as well as decreasing the levels of
GABA. Studies also suggest that jyotishmati preferentially
affects learning and recall of memory [48,49].
For centuries in India, Ashwagandha or Indian ginseng,
Withania somnifera (family Solanaceae) has been used as a
broad-spectrum
remedy
various
immunological conditions but today it is gaining recogni-
tion globally as a promising future herb for the manage-
ment of anxiety and stress. Ashwagandha is categorized as
an anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant herbal supplement.
The herb also can help regulate physiologic processes and
hence stabilizing the body’s response to stress exerting an
anxiolytic effect in animals and humans. Investigation for
immune modulation mechanism has so far identiﬁed major
ﬁve bio actives that are capable of regulating 15 immune
system pathways through 16 target proteins by bioactive-
target and protein-protein interactions, and hence indi-
cating the potential of withanolide-phytosterol combination
as an effective immunomodulator. Recent reviews on
ashwagandha suggest its extensive potential as neuro-
protective in various brain disorders and are supported by
relevant preclinical studies, clinical trials and published
patents. However, to promote ashwagandha as a drug,
more studies are warranted as today there is still vague
understanding of the mechanistic pathways involved in
imparting the neuroprotective effect. The phytoconstituents
of ashwagandha that are attributed with neuroprotective
properties and pharmacological effects in anxiety, AD, PD,
ASD, ADHD are sitoindosides VIIeX, withaferin A,
withanosides IV, withanols, withanolides A, B, D, anafer-
ine and beta-sitosterol [50e52].
Guduchi, Tinospora cordifolia (family: Menisperma-
ceae) is a large deciduous climbing shrub found mainly in
tropical parts of India. It has been widely used in the
traditional Indian system of medicine for its general
adaptogenic and immunomodulatory activity in ﬁghting
infections. It’s known to possess anti-inﬂammatory, anti-
stress action and improves learning and memory and its
antioxidant property is known to prevent/protect neuro-
degeneration. T. cordifolia is a medicinal plant popular
mainly for immunomodulatory activity. Its therapeutic
activity may be attributed to protoberberine alkaloids such
as jatrorrhizine, palmatine, and berberine [53,54]. On the
similar lines of beneﬁt Haridra or Turmeric, Curcuma
longa (Family; Zingiberaceae) and Guggulu or Commi-
phora wightii (Family: Burseraceae) also ﬁnd a frequent
mention along with the above stated herbs. Their neuro-
protective efﬁcacy along with anti-inﬂammatory, anti-
oxidant and anti-protein activities are complemented
with a very good safety proﬁle. Dietary curcumin is a
strong candidate for the management of major disabling
age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Guggulu con-
tains ferulic acids, phenols, and other non phenolic
aromatic acids which are potent scavengers of superoxide
radicals and can be important for the management of neuro
degenerative disorders that are associated with oxidative
stress [55,56].
Detoxiﬁcation (Panchakarma)
Panchakarma is a ﬁvefold treatment modality in Ayurveda
which is basically divided as purva karma (preparatory
procedure), Pradhan Karma (main operative procedure),
Pacchat
Karma
(postoperative
regimen).
Pan-
chakarma is majorly a biocleansing procedure which de-
toxiﬁes the body and helps in increasing bioavailability of
drugs
diet.
Purva

(Deepan), digestive (Pachan), oleation (Snehan), and
medicated steam therapy (Swedan). These are beneﬁcial for
lubricating, liquefying of toxic waste products/metabolites
accumulated in various channels of the body and helps for
easy elimination from the body through nearest route.
Pradhan Karma includes therapeutic emesis (vamana) and
therapeutic purgation (virechan) followed by medicated
enema (basti) and medicated nasal drops administration
(nasya). Pacchat Karma (postoperative regimen) is a
special dietary regimen to be followed to restore the
normalcy of body systems. Panchkarma is given depending
upon the prakriti and dosha type of a person. The treatment
of vata disturbance through oleation using oils medicated
with Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and Bala (Sida
cordifolia) are used to pacify vata. Oxidative stress plays a
vital role in the pathogenesis of degenerative disorders of
the brain. Thermal therapy is known to enhance antioxidant
functions and svedana may also facilitate a similar action.
Shirodhara is suggested to have anxiolytic, sympatholytic,
and immunopotential effects. Ashwagandha and Bala are
known antioxidants and may contribute to prevent the
pathogenesis.
Bala
chief
ingredient
Dhanvantaram tailam. After treatment with a polyherbal
formulation containing Ashwagandha and Bala, improved
mobility may be witnessed [57,58].
Diet (Ahara)
As per Ayurveda, food or diet (ahara) plays a major role in
nourishing the body, mind, and soul. It also deﬁnes certain
rules that should be followed for preparation, combination,
and consumption of food. Modern science describes food in
terms of its nutritional values, vitamins, minerals, proteins,
fats, carbohydrates, whereas Ayurvedic diet varies for every
individual based on factors like age, gender, dosha type
(vata, pitta, kapha) and the level of ama (toxins) in the
body. Ayurveda advocates satvik diet (fresh, juicy, light,
nourishing diet) to keep the mind calm and relaxed. Rajasik
diet (very spicy, salty and sour taste, stimulants like reﬁned
sugar and caffeine) should be avoided as they aggravate
pitta and vata which in turn increase restlessness, anger,
and irritability. Tamasik diet (stale, frozen, preserved, and
highly processed foods with preservatives and synthetic
additives) should not be consumed, as they diminish the
digestive ﬁre and produce toxic substances [59,60].
Rejuvenation (Yoga and Nidra)
Yoga is necessary for good health, as it helps in rapid
healing of the body and brings peace to the mind. Although
yoga has been used as a complementary health approach for
enhancing wellness and addressing a variety of health
issues, very few studies report yoga as either the primary
intervention or one component of a multicomponent
intervention in people with mild cognitive impairment or
dementia. Yoga may affect cognitive functioning through
improved sleep, mood, and neural connectivity. There are
several limitations of the existing studies, including a lack
of intervention details, as well as variability in the
frequency and components of the yoga interventions. A
further complicating issue is the role of various underlying
etiologies of cognitive impairment. Despite these limita-
tions, yoga is considered safe and potentially beneﬁcial
complementary health approach for people with dementia.
Some research studies suggest that yoga may have a
positive effect on CNS like improving the wave fre-
quencies, glucose metabolism, neurotransmitter activity,
and the autonomic nervous system. Yoga uses asanas
(physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), and
deep relaxation techniques to calm the senses, decrease
hyperactivity, enforce discipline, decrease the temper out-
bursts, emotional instability, and mood swings. Yoga asana
s that may be helpful in ASD include Trikonasan, Veer-
bhadrasan, Shahsakasana, Parvatasana, Sukhasan, Sha-
vasana. The practice of mantra meditation that involves
closing the eyes and mentally chanting a mantra for
10e20 min helps in developing a state of deep relaxation
and can be helpful in children with ADHD as it controls
stress, manages anxiety, and improves memory and atten-
tion. Recitation or attentive listening to “Omkar” also
proves beneﬁcial. In the subtle body, the majja dhatu is
dependent upon the ﬂow of prana primarily through
svadhisthana (lower abdominal center) and (heart center)
anahata chakras. Through these chakras the qualities of
water and air circulate, respectively [61-64].
Ayurveda considers nidra (sleep) to be a basic building
block for healthy mind and body. Sleeping on the right side
is the most relaxing and on the left, it is most digestive.
Sleep deprivation can cause diminished mental perfor-
mance and hence a good night sleep is vital for proper brain
function and helps in reducing stress and depression [64].
Discussion and way forward
Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine advo-
cates the use of medicinal plants and has customized
treatment approaches that can lay the foundation for new
modern day treatments. Considerable research on pharma-
cognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical therapeu-
tics of Ayurvedic medicinal plants has been carried out, and
many preclinical and clinical studies have shown cytopro-
tective, immunomodulatory, and immunoadjuvant potential
of Ayurvedic medicines. It can thus serve as an innovative
and powerful discovery engine for newer, safer, and
affordable medicines. To reinforce natural product drug
discovery, the clinical outcomes should be validated by
multiple
well-designed
long-term
studies.

considers neurological disorders (AD, PD, ASD, ADHD)
as the result of a vata dosha disorder. Mind, Body and Soul
must be in perfect synchronization for overall health.
Ayurveda advocates life style and behavior, nutrition, and
the use of medicinal plants and has components of
customized treatment approaches that can provide impor-
tant clues and leads for new treatments. The treatments and
remedies involving Rasayana (micronutrients) speciﬁc to
brain tissue are called Medhyarasayana that helps in
delaying brain aging, regeneration of neural tissues and are
known to help produce antistress, memory improvization,
and adaptogenic effects. The popular Medhyarasayana are
(Bacopa
monnieri),
Mandukaparni
(Centella
asiatica), Shankhapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis), Mad-
huyashti (Glycyrrhiza glabra), Jatamansi (Nordostachys
jatamansi), Jyotishmati (Celastrus paniculatus), Ashwa-
gandha (Withania somnifera), and Guduchi (Tinospora
cordifolia). Panchakarma, Ahara, Yoga, and Nidra can
help attain a balance of tridosha & prana, ojas, tejas and
can help lead a healthy life and avoid neurodegenerative
