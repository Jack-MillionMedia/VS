PHORISM OF

<!-- chunk -->

### H

IPPOCRATES

<!-- chunk -->

### estern herbalism was originally a part of Western medicine. In

<!-- chunk -->

### order to understand much of the herbal tradition we have

<!-- chunk -->

### inherited, we need to comprehend some of the concepts of old

<!-- chunk -->

### time Western practice. The old doctors did not possess the modern

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific technology that allows researchers to gaze upon the exact

<!-- chunk -->

### molecular structure of tissues, drugs, disease lesions, microorganisms,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the human genome itself. Instead, they had to define diseases and

<!-- chunk -->

### medicines in terms of broad physiological patterns, processes,

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic symptoms, and symptom-pictures observable with the

<!-- chunk -->

### naked eye, or a few simple instruments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Until 1930, the Western pharmacopoeia consisted largely of plant and

<!-- chunk -->

### mineral substances which were defined in terms of constituents which

<!-- chunk -->

### are sensible to the hand, eye, or tongue—mucilage, astringent, bitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### and so forth. These substances act on general physiological conditions,

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than molecular lesions. Within this milieu, plant medicines made

<!-- chunk -->

### sense. They provided sources of such ingredients in different

<!-- chunk -->

### combinations suitable to different problems and structures of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### With the change to modern biomedicine, drugs came to be defined

<!-- chunk -->

### according to a specific molecular structure. Herbs, with their less refined

<!-- chunk -->

### ingredients composed of masses of different constituents, became

<!-- chunk -->

### increasingly irrelevant. If they had value, it was because they might

<!-- chunk -->

### contain an ingredient that could be separated and refined to become a

<!-- chunk -->

### drug. The whole herb was no longer valuable in and of itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a similar manner, diseases are now defined in terms of molecular

<!-- chunk -->

### structure and change rather than as general processes, functions, or

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom-pictures. Thus, not only are herbs ignored, but the entire

<!-- chunk -->

### system of medicine of which they formed a part has also been forgotten.

<!-- chunk -->

### This has made it very hard to understand the old herbal literature,

<!-- chunk -->

### interwoven as it is with an old-time Western medicine which has become

<!-- chunk -->

### irrelevant and been forgotten.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recently there has been a revival of interest in Western herbalism,

<!-- chunk -->

### along with other systems of natural, traditional, and holistic medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of these approaches—acupuncture, homeopathy, and Ayurveda, for

<!-- chunk -->

### example—possess a long-standing medical philosophy and system upon

<!-- chunk -->

### which they may be practiced. On the other hand, Western herbalism,

<!-- chunk -->

### bereft from old-time Western medicine, possesses very little doctrine or

<!-- chunk -->

### guidance by which herbs can be related to diseases or parts of the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism. As a consequence, those who attempt to practice Western

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalism are forced to adopt a system from one of these other

<!-- chunk -->

### disciplines, or from biomedicine itself. Unfortunately, this causes the

<!-- chunk -->

### medicinal plants of the West to become, as it were, homeopathic,

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese, Ayurvedic, or biomedical agents. They have lost their unique

<!-- chunk -->

### identity and history, associated with thousands of years of popular and

<!-- chunk -->

### professional use.

<!-- chunk -->

### To compound this problem, Western science dismisses folk medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### as unscientific or even fraudulent. This has caused the demise of

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional healers, if not by outright persecution, then by economic and

<!-- chunk -->

### legal exclusion. By comparison, in China the folk medical applications of

<!-- chunk -->

### a plant are taken as the basis from which research may be conducted

<!-- chunk -->

### and traditional healers have been encouraged within government

<!-- chunk -->

### regulations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another side effect of this situation has been that herbs are now

<!-- chunk -->

### described and sold according to advertising based on “science.” In many

<!-- chunk -->

### cases the science is incomplete or misrepresentative, but only when a

<!-- chunk -->

### product sounds scientific will people flock to it. Thus, much of the herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### and nutritional marketplace apes conventional biomedicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If we are to use Western herbs in a holistic fashion we need to return to

<!-- chunk -->

### the physiological medicine with which they were associated. This is the

<!-- chunk -->

### system within which Western herbalism developed and its limited

<!-- chunk -->

### restoration allows us to recognize nuances in the Western herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### tradition which are lost when we adopt foreign concepts. We do not

<!-- chunk -->

### need to resurrect the old system entirely, only the most fundamental

<!-- chunk -->

### elements. We also need to bring it up to date.

<!-- chunk -->

### Not all physiological processes were understood in the old days—they

<!-- chunk -->

### are not, indeed, understood today—but, by using the physiological

<!-- chunk -->

### approach of old-time medicine, we can generate a system of medical

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding which is physiologically accurate and conducive to

<!-- chunk -->

### holistic care, i.e., cure. Plant medicines, constructed as they are from a

<!-- chunk -->

### broad slurry of chemical components, are naturally suited to the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of broad physiological patterns in the body, rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### specific molecular lesions. They also cure, that is to say, they stimulate

<!-- chunk -->

### or sedate or nourish or cleanse, as required by the case, to bring the

<!-- chunk -->

### physiological function back to health and restore self-maintenance and

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation within the organism, i.e., homeostasis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The radical concept of traditional folk medicine is that disease is

<!-- chunk -->

### curable, i.e., the organism can be returned to self-regulation and health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most modern people still go to their doctors nursing this quaint folk

<!-- chunk -->

### concept, but are instead treated to the modern theory: the organism is

<!-- chunk -->

### broken, nature is not able to take care of herself, hence science will take

<!-- chunk -->

### care of it through “health maintenance.” Modern biomedicine does not

<!-- chunk -->

### attempt to cure, but to maintain the organism through artificial means.

<!-- chunk -->

### In The Practice of Traditional Western Herbalism we will focus on the

<!-- chunk -->

### use of humors, qualities, or tissue states to describe basic, simple

<!-- chunk -->

### categories of pathology. We offer this as a contrast to the conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### view of molecular lesions. Due to the complexity of the subject, there is

<!-- chunk -->

### not enough space to include more than introductory material on the

<!-- chunk -->

### physiological patterns seen in the behavior of the major organs and

<!-- chunk -->

### systems of the body. This will have to await further publication. I am

<!-- chunk -->

### also reserving, for now, discussion of the regulatory systems, which

<!-- chunk -->

### oversee the general physiology of the organism. All these topics can be

<!-- chunk -->

### learned from the standpoint of holism, rather than conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### materialistic science.

<!-- chunk -->

### Anyone who masters the terminology in the second chapter (qualities

<!-- chunk -->

### and degrees) will be able to understand the basics of Greek herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### down to the Renaissance. The whole tradition will lie like an open book

<!-- chunk -->

### before the eye. Texts, which before seemed baffling or incomplete, will

<!-- chunk -->

### reveal depths not guessed. Likewise, anyone who masters the

<!-- chunk -->

### terminology in the third chapter (tissue states and a few herbal actions)

<!-- chunk -->

### will find the whole of nineteenth-and early twentieth-century herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### literature lying before the mind as an open book. There will then be no

<!-- chunk -->

### question what the old authors meant, or whether or not Western

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalism can be practiced upon a holistic foundation.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tools we use in complementary and alternative medicine are weak

<!-- chunk -->

### compared to those used by biomedicine. However, they can perform

<!-- chunk -->

### miracles which biomedicine cannot achieve. All of us in the field have

<!-- chunk -->

### seen this. How is this possible? It is because our tools work with one of

<!-- chunk -->

### the most powerful forces available, the energy of life or Nature herself.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we look at an animal or person we see an enormous amount of

<!-- chunk -->

### energy. When thwarted by sickness, this power is blocked or even

<!-- chunk -->

### empowers the illness. Supporting the self-healing power with simple

<!-- chunk -->

### methods like food, herbs, homeopathic medicines, acupuncture,

<!-- chunk -->

### therapeutic touch, mental attitude, and prayer can do wonders that can

<!-- chunk -->

### never be achieved when Nature is ignored or suppressed.

HOMAS

AUGHN

<!-- chunk -->

### t has often been said that Western herbalism lacks a “system of

<!-- chunk -->

### energetics.” What that means, in short, is a vocabulary for describing

<!-- chunk -->

### “energy patterns” or physiological and psychological patterns in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. The point is to express the activities and configurations of energy,

<!-- chunk -->

### qi, or the vital force—call it what you will. Examples of energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### systems include the yin/yang theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the

<!-- chunk -->

### five elements of China and India, or the four humors of Greek medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The use of an energetic system is virtually a prerequisite in holistic

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. Biomedicine is constructed upon a materialistic interpretation

<!-- chunk -->

### of nature, which looks to molecular structure as a guide. Holistic

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine is founded on the concept and experience that the organism is

<!-- chunk -->

### a functional unit or whole under the directing hand of an intelligent,

<!-- chunk -->

### self-regulating, and self-correcting guiding life force or energy. Since

<!-- chunk -->

### Nature in the organism is self-maintaining and self-healing, holistic

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine is further based upon the assumption that the organism can be

<!-- chunk -->

### cured, that is, returned from an unbalanced state to one of balance or

<!-- chunk -->

### homeostasis. As mentioned in the introduction, biomedicine does not

<!-- chunk -->

### seek to cure or return the organism to self-regulation, but removes and

<!-- chunk -->

### replaces broken parts through drugs or surgery. Thus, modern medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### speaks of “health management” rather than cure, while holistic or

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional medicine speaks of cure, vitalism, and energy patterns. The

<!-- chunk -->

### language is intrinsically different, and in order to practice holistic

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, or to practice Western herbalism on a holistic basis, we need

<!-- chunk -->

### to learn a new vocabulary.

<!-- chunk -->

### It should be understood that herbs can be used either way: to

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate the self-healing powers of the organism to return to health, or

<!-- chunk -->

### to artificially manipulate the organism to fit an artificial goal. For

<!-- chunk -->

### example, goldenseal can be used in small doses as a bitter tonic to

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulate the digestion and mucosa, removing tendencies to bacterial

<!-- chunk -->

### infection and mucus production, or it can be applied in massive doses as

<!-- chunk -->

### a “natural antibiotic” to kill bacteria. It contains a potent antibacterial,

<!-- chunk -->

### berberine. The first use is holistic because it increases the health of the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism while the second is an example of “health management”

<!-- chunk -->

### because it assumes that the organism cannot get rid of the bacteria on its

<!-- chunk -->

### own and the knowledge of the practitioner is superior. The use of herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### is not necessarily holistic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whatever qi or life force is, most of us see it indirectly, in its effects. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is the fact that this energy forms patterns that interests us. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### particular patterns to health, and to disease. Thus, Hippocrates bids us

<!-- chunk -->

### learn the medical art by looking at a man in the bloom of health, and

<!-- chunk -->

### comparing him with a man on the edge of death. In order to describe

<!-- chunk -->

### and influence the patterns of disease formed by unbalanced energy or qi,

<!-- chunk -->

### we need a “language of energy patterns.”

<!-- chunk -->

### A survey of various cultures around the world shows that a simple

<!-- chunk -->

### system of two, three, four, or five elements, qualities, or humors forms

<!-- chunk -->

### the basis of diagnosis and treatment in traditional holistic medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditional Chinese medicine uses the yin/yang system and the five

<!-- chunk -->

### elements. Ayurvedic medicine uses the three doshas and the five

<!-- chunk -->

### elements. Greek medicine used the four elements, qualities, humors, and

<!-- chunk -->

### temperaments. American Indian medicine acknowledges four to seven

<!-- chunk -->

### directions.

<!-- chunk -->

### These different terms are translated fairly easily from one system to

<!-- chunk -->

### another. Yin and yang resemble fire and water in another system, the

<!-- chunk -->

### five elements of China and India are similar to the four elements of

<!-- chunk -->

### Greece, and the magical fifth element of alchemy. Local culture, weather

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns, and epidemiology determine the arrangement and number of

<!-- chunk -->

### elements or humors but they bear considerable resemblance to one

<!-- chunk -->

### another.

<!-- chunk -->

### One further point should be made. The arrangement of elements,

<!-- chunk -->

### directions, or humors into a fourfold mandala (cross or square) serves an

<!-- chunk -->

### important psychological and spiritual function. The psychiatrist C. G.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jung showed that the mandala was a symbol of wholeness for the

<!-- chunk -->

### psyche. Many of us, when we read about or look at pictures of the four

<!-- chunk -->

### or five elements, feel this deep sense of meaning and fulfillment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although this symbol is mythological and spiritual in nature that does

<!-- chunk -->

### not mean it should be excluded from medicine. Rather medicine, to be

<!-- chunk -->

### holistic and curative, must include mythic elements to satisfy the soul

<!-- chunk -->

### and spirit.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Forgotten Energetics of Western Herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### At the beginning of the chapter, it was said that Western herbalism lacks

<!-- chunk -->

### a system of energy patterns. Actually, this is not true—it is just that this

<!-- chunk -->

### special vocabulary has been forgotten.

<!-- chunk -->

### These energetics still exist. They are inferred in the list of herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### “actions” which are found in the front or back of just about every herb

<!-- chunk -->

### book. These include terms like diuretic, diaphoretic, stimulant,

<!-- chunk -->

### emmenagogue, aromatic, and astringent. When I first began the study of

<!-- chunk -->

### Western herbalism, I couldn’t get very far because these terms seemed so

<!-- chunk -->

### wooden and mechanical. I thought the terms were unrelated to a deeper

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic context connected to the life force, and which could stimulate

<!-- chunk -->

### my intuitive understanding and problem solving. After many years, I

<!-- chunk -->

### came to appreciate that they were the remains of an energetic system

<!-- chunk -->

### that had been forgotten.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two basic subdivisions of herbal actions, one referring to the

<!-- chunk -->

### “tissue state” or pathological condition, and the other to the organ or

<!-- chunk -->

### seat on which the agent operates. The first category is composed of

<!-- chunk -->

### terms like astringent, emollient, mucilage, stimulant, aromatic,

<!-- chunk -->

### refrigerant, antispasmodic, antiseptics, and normalizer. The second refers

<!-- chunk -->

### to specific local organs or functions: diuretic (kidneys), nephritic

<!-- chunk -->

### (kidneys), expectorant (lungs), pectoral (lungs), diaphoretic (skin and

<!-- chunk -->

### fever), febrifuge (fever), nervine, emmenagogue (menses promoting),

<!-- chunk -->

### cholagogue (gall bladder), etc. There was originally a third category,

<!-- chunk -->

### which described whether the herb raised or lowered, internalized or

<!-- chunk -->

### externalized, thinned or thickened, but this was dropped by the end of

<!-- chunk -->

### the eighteenth century. A classical reference for these three categories

<!-- chunk -->

### can be found in A Key to Galen’s Method of Physick, (c. 1650) by Nicholas

<!-- chunk -->

### Culpeper.

<!-- chunk -->

### It may not be readily apparent how the word astringent is an energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### term. However, a short examination shows that it does refer us to an

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic pattern. The condition which an astringent acts upon is not a

<!-- chunk -->

### specific molecular lesion or disease in a modern biomedical sense, but

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue which is prolapsed and leaking fluids. Astringents contain tannic

<!-- chunk -->

### acids that contract tissue and prevent prolapse and fluid loss. Thus, the

<!-- chunk -->

### term astringent refers to an energetic category—what the Chinese,

<!-- chunk -->

### Indian, Greek, or Arabic doctors would have called “dampness.”

<!-- chunk -->

### During the evolution of Western medicine the old energetic terms hot,

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, damp, and dry were dropped, and in their place, terms like

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant (warming), refrigerant (cooling), mucilage (moistening), and

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent (drying) were adopted. This represented a movement away

<!-- chunk -->

### from a mythological frame of mind towards one that was increasingly

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific. Yet, such terms still refer to general physiological patterns in

<!-- chunk -->

### the organism rather than specific molecular lesions, as is the practice in

<!-- chunk -->

### modern diagnosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The organ-and function-specific terms are also energetic in that they

<!-- chunk -->

### refer to broad physiological functions in the organism rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### specific lesions. They refer us back to the period when even conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors treated conditions in this manner. At that time, drugs and herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### were more closely related because both were defined in terms of general

<!-- chunk -->

### physiological effects or local affinities. Now drugs are applied to

<!-- chunk -->

### molecular changes and people want to ape modern biomedicine by

<!-- chunk -->

### applying herbs in the same fashion. Unfortunately, herbs generally do

<!-- chunk -->

### not work this way. Sometimes they contain enough berberine, for

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, to kill bacterium, but usually their positive effect is based upon

<!-- chunk -->

### a slurry of different chemicals found together in the original plant.

<!-- chunk -->

### The reason herbs are suited to the old-fashioned approach, i.e., to the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of broad physiological patterns in the body rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### specific molecular lesions, is that they are in fact complexes of many

<!-- chunk -->

### different chemicals drawn together. These combinations come together

<!-- chunk -->

### in the plant, not randomly, but to solve a certain environmental problem

<!-- chunk -->

### or imbalance which assaulted the plant from outside. The chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

### found in goldenseal undoubtedly help it to live in the rich, shady, well-

<!-- chunk -->

### watered woodlands of Eastern North America where it is native. It is not

<!-- chunk -->

### apparent exactly how that environment resembles the damp, nutrient-

<!-- chunk -->

### coated mucosa of the digestive tract. One can see a sort of metaphorical

<!-- chunk -->

### similarity, but the peculiar slurry of chemistry found in goldenseal

<!-- chunk -->

### makes it an ideal tonic for sub-functional mucosa. The very least that

<!-- chunk -->

### can be said is that the taste, a mixture of bitter and sweet, stimulates the

<!-- chunk -->

### secretions of the mouth and thus triggers secretions all the way down

<!-- chunk -->

### the digestive canal. Goldenseal is thus defined, according to the list of

<!-- chunk -->

### actions, as a “bitter tonic” for the digestive mucosa in particular.

<!-- chunk -->

### Modern medicine does not think in broad, physiological terms. For

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, stomach ulcer would be treated by the use of an antibacterial

<!-- chunk -->

### that kills the bacteria associated with gastric ulceration. It does not

<!-- chunk -->

### attempt to change the tissue imbalance that led to the proliferation of

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria at that location—it is not even interested in the fact that there

<!-- chunk -->

### might be a changed tissue condition that encouraged the proliferation in

<!-- chunk -->

### the first place. Consequently, when the person is exposed to the bacteria

<!-- chunk -->

### again it will again multiply and settle in. In holistic herbal medicine, on

<!-- chunk -->

### the other hand, we would want to change the tissue state that supports

<!-- chunk -->

### the invasive agent. Here we could hardly do better than to use

<!-- chunk -->

### goldenseal, which is almost infallible for the treatment and long-term

<!-- chunk -->

### cure of stomach ulcers. Goldenseal is successful, not just because it kills

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria, but because it stimulates increased mucosal activity and

<!-- chunk -->

### secretions, making the stomach tissue more active and less susceptible to

<!-- chunk -->

### bacterial infection.

<!-- chunk -->

### For several hundred years there has been a bias in Western education

<!-- chunk -->

### against the intuitive approach in medicine and science. Intuition,

<!-- chunk -->

### imagination, and instinct are relegated to art or religion. There it is

<!-- chunk -->

### permissible to use such faculties. While one can appreciate the need for

<!-- chunk -->

### objective observation and analytical study, the use of these methods

<!-- chunk -->

### alone, as if they were the only true measures of reality, in and of itself, is

<!-- chunk -->

### an inherently sick and flawed condition. It skews the human organism

<!-- chunk -->

### by rendering obsolete skills and faculties it has always relied upon to

<!-- chunk -->

### contend with environmental and internal stress. As a consequence, we in

<!-- chunk -->

### the West have lost much in the way of our traditional energetic systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### We pride ourselves on education and sophistication, but we have lost the

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to speak about the world as an intuitive experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whatever people say they believe in terms of spirituality and religion,

<!-- chunk -->

### what they do when they are sick and in need reflects the true basis of

<!-- chunk -->

### their belief system. For the average person, science and medicine is the

<!-- chunk -->

### answer. Religion is reserved for miracles, not solving everyday problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### In other words, science and medicine visualize and teach us that we are

<!-- chunk -->

### innately separated from our spiritual and, to a large extent, our

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological resources; that we cannot solve our everyday problems

<!-- chunk -->

### through these means but must turn away from spirit and put our faith in

<!-- chunk -->

### the material world. From a spiritual perspective, this view is not neutral

<!-- chunk -->

### but actively anti-spiritual. It reinforces a completely materialistic view of

<!-- chunk -->

### the nature of life. Miracles—if they exist—and spiritual life—if it exists

<!-- chunk -->

### —are far removed from everyday life.

<!-- chunk -->

### In holistic medicine we hold up a different view. We are not isolated

<!-- chunk -->

### from life, we are an expression of life. We are part of this unseen force

<!-- chunk -->

### that propels and patterns us in our daily lives. If we can believe in the

<!-- chunk -->

### unseen power of the life force we are much closer to a real appreciation

<!-- chunk -->

### of the existence and power of the soul and spirit, i.e., the psychological

<!-- chunk -->

### apparatus and the spirit which guides us towards a meaningful life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those who kill the life of the body also, in some measure, kill the life of

<!-- chunk -->

### the soul and spirit.

<!-- chunk -->

### A culture that has lost its folk medicine, or its ability to heal and cure

<!-- chunk -->

### everyday problems with everyday materials, has lost a part of its soul.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is something deeply sick about Western culture. If we are to

<!-- chunk -->

### restore it to health we need to restore its lost folk medical soul. This

<!-- chunk -->

### means that people are going to have to trust their personal resources and

<!-- chunk -->

### make decisions for themselves, rather than being controlled by statistical

<!-- chunk -->

### studies, worse case scenarios, or the consensus opinion of experts and

<!-- chunk -->

### counter-intuitive advice. It also means that we are going to have to

<!-- chunk -->

### restore folk medicine to Western culture.

<!-- chunk -->

### It also has to be said that it is not possible to understand the

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional uses of Western herbs unless they are viewed against the

<!-- chunk -->

### backdrop of the folk medical or pre-modern system in which they

<!-- chunk -->

### developed. Using Western herbs according to an Eastern energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### system does not bring forth their cultural and medical richness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Furthermore, it is not enough to borrow concepts from Eastern or

<!-- chunk -->

### American Indian sources because this only feeds the illusion that some

<!-- chunk -->

### expert outside ourselves has the answer. Thus, in order to restore the

<!-- chunk -->

### folk medical soul of our white Western culture, we need to use terms

<!-- chunk -->

### that are already in use in the culture and supply them with their lost

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic meanings.

<!-- chunk -->

### It would seem like an almost hopeless job to restore Western folk

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, but in fact the terms used to describe energetics in the late

<!-- chunk -->

### nineteenth and early twentieth century are still in use today. Thus, we

<!-- chunk -->

### can use terms that are both energetic and familiar. These are the “tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### states” described in the third chapter: irritation or excitation;

<!-- chunk -->

### constriction or tension; atrophy or wasting; relaxation; torpor or

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation; and depression or lack of excitation. In addition, we can

<!-- chunk -->

### restore the organ-and function-based medicine of the old doctors which

<!-- chunk -->

### common people intuitively understand—my “stomach hurts, or,” I’m

<!-- chunk -->

### going to the “heart specialist.” At the same time, these relatively modern

<!-- chunk -->

### terms relate exactly to the elements, humors, or qualities of ancient

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. Thus, we can make references between different systems and

<!-- chunk -->

### adjust terminology to fit our needs.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is for these reasons that this book will describe the ancient energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### system of Western medicine and herbalism, and the energetic method of

<!-- chunk -->

### the immediate past, in order to build a background for a profound

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding of herbs and their actions on the human organism. Our

<!-- chunk -->

### approach will be to define the “tissue states,” their relationship to

<!-- chunk -->

### ancient elemental or humoral energetics, and apply them to the organs

<!-- chunk -->

### and functions of the body as understood in broad physiological patterns,

<!-- chunk -->

### not as molecular structures and functions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Energetic Classification

<!-- chunk -->

### In case our meandering in the history of medicine is too difficult for our

<!-- chunk -->

### readers, let us sum up the above argument by introducing some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### basic energetic terminology used in traditional medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most simple and elegant breakdown of matter and energy into

<!-- chunk -->

### patterns begins with the dualism, so well expressed in traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese philosophy and medicine as yin and yang. Philosophically, the

<!-- chunk -->

### former represents the passive, feminine side of the universe, while the

<!-- chunk -->

### latter represents the active, masculine side. Traditional medicine is more

<!-- chunk -->

### pragmatic, with yin standing for water, cooling, nourishing, and rest,

<!-- chunk -->

### and yang standing for fire, warming, and action. The four qualities of

<!-- chunk -->

### hot, cold, damp, and dry can easily be deduced from the primal two:

<!-- chunk -->

### yang excesshot

<!-- chunk -->

### yang deficiencycold

<!-- chunk -->

### yin excessdamp

<!-- chunk -->

### yin deficiencydry

<!-- chunk -->

### This gives us the four qualities of Greek/Arabic medicine derived from

<!-- chunk -->

### an initial dyad. There is a system of six environmental influences in

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese practice analogous to the four qualities: hot, cold, wind, damp,

<!-- chunk -->

### dry, and summer heat (a kind of humid heat). The four qualities also

<!-- chunk -->

### correspond to the four elements of Greek philosophy. Interestingly, they

<!-- chunk -->

### correlate with the states of matter recognized in chemistry:

<!-- chunk -->

### Firehotcombustion

<!-- chunk -->

### Airdrygas

<!-- chunk -->

### Waterdampliquid

<!-- chunk -->

### Earthcoldsolid

<!-- chunk -->

### The ancient Israelites and Egyptians only recognized three elements—

<!-- chunk -->

### air, water, and earth—thinking of fire as a different kind of agent that

<!-- chunk -->

### changed the other three. In Greek and Indian philosophy, a fifth element

<!-- chunk -->

### was added which acts on the other four: the quintessence or ether. This

<!-- chunk -->

### was associated with wind. And thus, in Chinese medicine, we have five

<!-- chunk -->

### elements including wind. The whole round of associations would look

<!-- chunk -->

### like this:

<!-- chunk -->

## GreeceIndiaChina

<!-- chunk -->

### Etherether (wind)wind

<!-- chunk -->

### Firefirefire

<!-- chunk -->

### Airairmetal

<!-- chunk -->

### Waterwaterwater

<!-- chunk -->

### Earthearthearth

<!-- chunk -->

### After the fall of Greek medicine, the Western doctors adopted the

<!-- chunk -->

### theory of irritation, based on the observation that nerve tissue when

<!-- chunk -->

### removed from the body, was irritable or reactive to certain influences

<!-- chunk -->

### such as, for example, heat and cold. This led to the organizing of tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### states, or energetic patterns, based on irritability and relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Eventually, J.M. Thurston developed a model comprised of six basic

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue states:

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue StateQuality

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation, excitationheat

<!-- chunk -->

### constriction, tensionwind

<!-- chunk -->

### atrophydry

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxationdamp flowing

<!-- chunk -->

### torpordamp stagnation

<!-- chunk -->

### depressioncold

<!-- chunk -->

### In Greek medicine, dampness was divided into damp that flowed and

<!-- chunk -->

### damp that stayed stuck in the body. In Ayurvedic medicine, the water

<!-- chunk -->

### element also is used twice as the three doshas (water, fire, and air) and

<!-- chunk -->

### the five elements are placed in relationship:

<!-- chunk -->

## DoshaElementTissue State

<!-- chunk -->

### vataairatrophy

<!-- chunk -->

### windconstriction

<!-- chunk -->

### pittafireirritation, excitation

<!-- chunk -->

### waterrelaxation (water flowing)

<!-- chunk -->

### kaphawater earthtorpor (water stagnant) depression

<!-- chunk -->

### We will visit the theme of the three doshas and the corresponding

<!-- chunk -->

### elements and tissue states in the chapter on constitution.

<!-- chunk -->

### A final set of relationships might be useful:

<!-- chunk -->

## ExcessDeficiency

<!-- chunk -->

## RateExcitationDepression

<!-- chunk -->

## TensionConstrictionRelaxation

<!-- chunk -->

## DensityAtrophyTorpor

<!-- chunk -->

### Atrophy represents a state where the system is too dry or solid, while

<!-- chunk -->

### torpor represents a condition where it is too wet, lacking in solidity and

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnant.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Energetic Organism

<!-- chunk -->

### The organism does not remain fixed permanently in a constitutional or

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state, but is subject to perpetual change. This is already implicated

<!-- chunk -->

### in the energetic classification scheme mentioned above, where wind

<!-- chunk -->

### serves to represent the element, or factor of change. Thus, in addition to

<!-- chunk -->

### providing a classification of energy types, patterns, and constitutions,

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional and holistic medicine also provide a view of the organism as

<!-- chunk -->

### a dynamic biological entity.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the traditional view, which we find in virtually every area of the

<!-- chunk -->

### world, the organism is seen as a dynamic entity consuming and breaking

<!-- chunk -->

### down food to build an inner fire, which, in turn, radiates outward to

<!-- chunk -->

### keep the organism cleansing and eliminating. The fire of life is visualized

<!-- chunk -->

### in Ayurvedic medicine as a digestive/metabolic flame, situated at the

<!-- chunk -->

### pyloric sphincter, consuming, transforming, and breaking down food and

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins. As one feeds the organism, the other is eliminated. If toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### (called amma in Ayurveda) are retained, the internal flame will be

<!-- chunk -->

### “gummed up” and the digestion and metabolism will be less successful.

<!-- chunk -->

### This leads to the generation of disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Very much the same view exists in the traditional American herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### descending down to us from Samuel Thomson (1767–1842), a self-

<!-- chunk -->

### taught New Hampshire herbalist. He used both herbs and a simple sort

<!-- chunk -->

### of sweat lodge to “raise the fire” in the interior (in the stomach, as he

<!-- chunk -->

### visualized it), break down “canker” (mucus) obstructing the fire, and

<!-- chunk -->

### open the skin, so that the fire could radiate outwards, from center to

<!-- chunk -->

### circumference. In this way, the body was nourished and warmed, while

<!-- chunk -->

### the canker or obstructions were eliminated.

<!-- chunk -->

### There can be little doubt that Thomson’s model came from the

<!-- chunk -->

### American Indian people. He used a simple sweat lodge, as much as his

<!-- chunk -->

### “course of medicine” or herbs to raise the fire, cut canker, and open the

<!-- chunk -->

### periphery. His early disciples were known as “steaming doctors.” This

<!-- chunk -->

### method was unknown in central Europe but is well attested on the

<!-- chunk -->

### American frontier. Lewis and Clark describe how one of their men was

<!-- chunk -->

### cured of arthritic stiffness in a sweat lodge erected by friendly Indians

<!-- chunk -->

### during their journey. The sweat lodge itself, with a fire in the middle

<!-- chunk -->

### generating steam from water poured on it, spreading outward towards

<!-- chunk -->

### the perimeter, is almost the perfect picture of the dynamic, energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### organism.

<!-- chunk -->

### In these simple models from throughout the world, water is actually of

<!-- chunk -->

### equal importance with fire. It controls and modulates the activity of fire.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Chinese and European alchemical tradition, the organism is pictured

<!-- chunk -->

### as a three chambered vessel sitting on a fire. In the lower chamber,

<!-- chunk -->

### water is boiling; in the middle chamber it is running down the sides of

<!-- chunk -->

### the vessel in little rivulets; while in the upper chamber, it is steam. This

<!-- chunk -->

### reflects the interaction of fire and water in the body. In traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese medicine, the thoracic cavity is considered to be the “upper

<!-- chunk -->

### burner” where water is found in the steamy phase. Heart and lungs

<!-- chunk -->

### disperse the aerated blood like a mist through the body. In the “middle

<!-- chunk -->

### burner,” the digestive organs run like rivers full of water and nutriment,

<!-- chunk -->

### past and through the fires of transformation, down to the “lower

<!-- chunk -->

### burner,” where water is held in check and periodically removed.

<!-- chunk -->

### One can see the origins of the “humoral model” of medicine in this

<!-- chunk -->

### picture of the behavior of the body. When the organism is in balance,

<!-- chunk -->

### the “humors” leave on a regular, healthy basis through the channels of

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination, the kidneys, colon, skin, and lungs. When the organism is

<!-- chunk -->

### not healthy, the humors spill over or are retained. The job of the

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional physician or nurse, therefore, is to regulate the activity of the

<!-- chunk -->

### humors.

<!-- chunk -->

### What modern practitioners of holistic medicine call “energetics” is

<!-- chunk -->

### called “humoralism” by historians of medicine. I have, however, chosen

<!-- chunk -->

### the terminology used by practitioners rather than by outsiders.

<!-- chunk -->

### One more aspect of this model requires elucidation. In all of these

<!-- chunk -->

### models there is some concept of a waste product which obstructs the fire

<!-- chunk -->

### within and thickens the internal waters. In Ayurveda this is called amma,

<!-- chunk -->

### a term which incorporates the idea of both thickened phlegm and toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Thomson’s model it was called canker, a colonial American folk

<!-- chunk -->

### medical rendering of what the old English practitioners would have

<!-- chunk -->

### called humor, or humor in the blood. When the fluids of the body are

<!-- chunk -->

### thickened up, they block the internal fire, whether we visualize it in the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach, as Thomson did, or more internally.

<!-- chunk -->

### The terms humor and canker came to be replaced later in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nineteenth century by the concept of “impure blood” or “bad blood.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The former term is a translation from German while the latter is the

<!-- chunk -->

### English phrase typically used by American Indian practitioners,

<!-- chunk -->

### including many I know at the present time. Today this folk medical

<!-- chunk -->

### substance would be called a “toxin.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The concept of toxin is a very important one in Western herbalism. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has been updated with improvements in the understanding of the

<!-- chunk -->

### function of the organism. In the early twentieth century, toxins were

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with the liver, because this was the seat of the preparatory

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism (the preparation of food/toxins coming out of the intestine),

<!-- chunk -->

### and the thyroid, which sets the rate of cellular metabolism. Dr. Broda

<!-- chunk -->

### Barnes (1976) actually equates “bad blood” with hypothyroidism and

<!-- chunk -->

### also mentions that one of the most characteristic symptoms of low

<!-- chunk -->

### thyroid found in autopsies is a thickened, phlegmy substance in the

<!-- chunk -->

### internal fluids composed of mucopolysaccharides—an amma, canker, or

<!-- chunk -->

### humor.

<!-- chunk -->

### The concept of toxins and detoxification has, in the current revival of

<!-- chunk -->

### holistic practice, been almost detached from any kind of diagnostic study

<!-- chunk -->

### of the organism, so that many people simply detoxify themselves,

<!-- chunk -->

### whether there is evidence of toxins in the system or not.

<!-- chunk -->

## Energetic Laws

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to a system of classification for energy patterns and a view of

<!-- chunk -->

### the organism as an energetic biological entity, holistic and traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine also has come to recognize certain laws governing the behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### of energy, qi, or vital force. Thus, in Chinese philosophy the concept of

<!-- chunk -->

### qi is intimately associated with li, or law. In the West, these laws or

<!-- chunk -->

### principles have been particularly developed. From Galen to the present,

<!-- chunk -->

### much has been made of therapeutic laws by which the medicinal agent

<!-- chunk -->

### is applied to the sick organism. Thus, Galen supported the “law of

<!-- chunk -->

### contraries” while Paracelsus and Hahnemann rebelled against him and

<!-- chunk -->

### advocated the use of “similars.” Dr. Harold Lindlahr, the “philosopher of

<!-- chunk -->

### naturopathy,” saw the two laws as coming under one heading: the “law

<!-- chunk -->

### of action and reaction.” A similar unified doctrine, the Arndt/Schulz law,

<!-- chunk -->

### states that every biological action creates an equal and opposite reaction;

<!-- chunk -->

### therefore, both contraries and similar restore the organism to its original

<!-- chunk -->

### state.

<!-- chunk -->

### The law of contraries teaches that if the organism has gotten too cold,

<!-- chunk -->

### it will be restored to balance by warming agents. Thus, from the time of

<!-- chunk -->

### Galen to the present, “carminatives” or warming, aromatic herbs and

<!-- chunk -->

### spices are used to “warm up” a “cold stomach,” i.e., a digestive tract in

<!-- chunk -->

### which the secretions are deficient. Carminatives are pungent and bitter,

<!-- chunk -->

### so they stimulate, warm, and excite secretions, from the mouth on down

<!-- chunk -->

### the gastrointestinal canal.

<!-- chunk -->

### The law of similars was originally based on the “doctrine of

<!-- chunk -->

### signatures,” i.e., the idea that the plant looks like or resembles in some

<!-- chunk -->

### way the disease, organ, or symptom. This is considered by modern

<!-- chunk -->

### science, as it was by Galen himself, to be a fallacious concept based on

<!-- chunk -->

### “magical thinking,” or thinking by analogy. Rudolf Steiner, on the other

<!-- chunk -->

### hand, defended the use of signatures, stating that the same power that

<!-- chunk -->

### made the color, shape, or habit, in a plant created a disease imbalance in

<!-- chunk -->

### the human organism, and thus the one would treat the other. There is

<!-- chunk -->

### power in analogy, when the two similars are related by essential,

<!-- chunk -->

### internal characteristics, rather than simple, external resemblance.

<!-- chunk -->

### Emmanuel Swedenborg differentiated between these two as

<!-- chunk -->

### “correspondents” and “representations.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, introduced the use

<!-- chunk -->

### of the law of similars on a different basis. He noted that the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### caused by a poison were those which would be cured by the same agent

<!-- chunk -->

### used in a smaller dose. His thinking originated at the same time as the

<!-- chunk -->

### smallpox vaccination was being developed by Edward Jenner and

<!-- chunk -->

### represents a vitalistic interpretation of the fact that the body is

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated by a similar to fight against the original contagion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hahnemann’s followers have also used the “doctrine of signatures.”

<!-- chunk -->

### According to homeopathic doctrine, foods work upon the system by

<!-- chunk -->

### contrary while poisons cure by similarity. Thus, if the organism is short

<!-- chunk -->

### on iron it needs to consume iron in some friendly food. However, if there

<!-- chunk -->

### is a sickness in the organism that causes it to reject, or eliminate, or not

<!-- chunk -->

### pick up iron, then a remedy is needed which operates by similar, one

<!-- chunk -->

### which creates the same imbalance in the healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### In reality, as Lindlahr, Arndt, and Schulz pointed out, the organism is

<!-- chunk -->

### cured both by contraries and by similars. The important point is that

<!-- chunk -->

### sickness develops along an axis—too hot, too cold—and is fixed along

<!-- chunk -->

### the same axis. If the cooling agent is applied to fever in a way that helps

<!-- chunk -->

### the struggling organism, it will strengthen the organism to remove fever.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the other hand, if the similar causing the fever is administered in a

<!-- chunk -->

### small dose, it will stimulate the body to renew and reinvigorate the fight

<!-- chunk -->

### against the pathogenic factor, strengthening the powers of resistance and

<!-- chunk -->

### leading to cure. What is most important is that the cure is in the same

<!-- chunk -->

### axis as the disease. Suppression occurs when the organism is forced to

<!-- chunk -->

### act in a certain way, according to artificial, external agents, which hide

<!-- chunk -->

### the disease process and symptoms. This, however, does not cure, but sets

<!-- chunk -->

### up a new disease. As mentioned previously, this is the difference

<!-- chunk -->

### between holistic healing and conventional biomedicine: the one sees the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism as able to return to self-governance while the other does not

<!-- chunk -->

### believe in this self-cure and therefore seeks to “manage” health for the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three primal laws of energetic healing: the law of action and

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction (or contraries and similars), the law of direction of cure

<!-- chunk -->

### (Hering’s law), and the law of the healing crisis. These themes will be

<!-- chunk -->

### more fully developed throughout our work in The Practice of Traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Western Herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Medicine Wheel

<!-- chunk -->

### Before closing, let us return to the theme of the four or five elements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout the world, the four directions or quarters are a potent

<!-- chunk -->

### symbol. C.G. Jung observed that the mandala, a cross or square picturing

<!-- chunk -->

### the four directions, represents for the human soul a feeling of wholeness,

<!-- chunk -->

### completeness, and well-being. This gives a different dimension to the

<!-- chunk -->

### four qualities and elements. Not only do they provide an analytical

<!-- chunk -->

### method for classifying patterns in nature, but also they represent

<!-- chunk -->

### wholeness and well-being. They are, in and of themselves, healing.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jung taught that the four directions represented, among other things,

<!-- chunk -->

### the four functions of the psyche: intuition (sensing the whole picture),

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking (mentation), feeling (emotionality), and sensation (body

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge). Each person favors one of these functions, but together they

<!-- chunk -->

### represent wholeness.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the four functions, Jung taught the existence of a fifth

<!-- chunk -->

### or “transcendent” function, which came into operation when a person

<!-- chunk -->

### was stuck and their ordinary inventory of knowledge was insufficient to

<!-- chunk -->

### solve their problems. The transcendent function first appears as the

<!-- chunk -->

### helpful dream or daydream. With practice, the imagination can be

<!-- chunk -->

### accessed for solutions more easily. Ultimately, the transcendent function

<!-- chunk -->

### is essentially the active imagination. Jung saw this function as

<!-- chunk -->

### corresponding to the “fifth element” or quintessence that both moves and

<!-- chunk -->

### stands outside the four directions or elements in mytho-poetic culture. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is often referred to as the wind, breath, or ether in traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### symbolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rudolf Steiner used a fourfold classification system similar to the

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional Greek method. He associated the “I-organization” or self-

<!-- chunk -->

### consciousness with the fire element; the “astral body” or animal

<!-- chunk -->

### instincts/autonomic nervous system with air; the “etheric body” or

<!-- chunk -->

### vegetative/cellular functions with water; and the physical body or

<!-- chunk -->

### mineral world with earth. For Steiner, warming plants tend to increase

<!-- chunk -->

### sensation and consciousness by stimulating circulation and nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### sensation. (Compare Robert Schmidt’s description of heat in the four

<!-- chunk -->

### qualities model as individualizing or separating).

<!-- chunk -->

### We see this in the mint family, which is largely warming and

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating. Rosemary was perhaps the archetypal fiery mint used by

<!-- chunk -->

### Steiner to increase circulation, nervous sensation, and consciousness. He

<!-- chunk -->

### would express this by saying that the “I-organization” exerted its

<!-- chunk -->

### influence from the mind down through the bodily pole, though it would

<!-- chunk -->

### be simpler to say that the warmth or fire element is extended into bodily

<!-- chunk -->

### functions through innervation and circulation. By comparison, the

<!-- chunk -->

### cooling plants, of which the rose family is a prime example, tend to

<!-- chunk -->

### refine and articulate perception and experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to his occult training and his life-long study of the

<!-- chunk -->

### alternative science of J. W. Goethe, Steiner studied under an herbalist.

<!-- chunk -->

### They met one day on a crowded train. Steiner was impressed with the

<!-- chunk -->

### wisdom of the older man and thereafter often traveled to study with

<!-- chunk -->

### him. It is therefore not surprising that Steiner’s work is filled with a

<!-- chunk -->

### considerable knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants.

<!-- chunk -->

### In many Native American cultures, the circle with four directions

<!-- chunk -->

### represents healing. This is called the “sacred hoop” or “medicine wheel.”

<!-- chunk -->

### It is thus used to organize medical knowledge. J.T. Garrett in The

<!-- chunk -->

### Cherokee Herbal (2003) gives an excellent description of the classification

<!-- chunk -->

### of medicinal plants by the four directions. The east relates to the heart

<!-- chunk -->

### and family life, heart remedies, and blood remedies. The south relates to

<!-- chunk -->

### acute injuries and diseases brought on by exposure to the dangers of the

<!-- chunk -->

### world. The west relates to internal diseases. The north relates to stored

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge, wisdom, teaching, peace, and being in harmony with the

<!-- chunk -->

### world.

<!-- chunk -->

### This way of defining the directions corresponds closely with the

<!-- chunk -->

### directions as described independently by my friend Paul Red Elk, who

<!-- chunk -->

### received traditional herbal training from his Lakota grandfather in

<!-- chunk -->

### western South Dakota.

<!-- chunk -->

### The point should be made that the four directions can be defined in

<!-- chunk -->

### many different ways and the medicine wheel itself can be arranged in

<!-- chunk -->

### even more variety. Even the correlations between the values of the four

<!-- chunk -->

### elements or directions are variable to a certain extent. For instance,

<!-- chunk -->

### Aristotle correlated the four qualities to the four elements as: fire (hot

<!-- chunk -->

### and dry), air (hot and damp), water (cold and damp), earth (cold and

<!-- chunk -->

### dry). They have sometimes been arranged in a different fashion that I

<!-- chunk -->

### personally find more accurate: fire (hot), air (dry), water (damp), and

<!-- chunk -->

### earth (cold).

<!-- chunk -->

### Karyn Sanders, a Native American practitioner living in California,

<!-- chunk -->

### first introduced me to the herbal medicine wheel. She emphasized heat

<!-- chunk -->

### and cold rather than the different segments of life. I have followed her

<!-- chunk -->

### example, modifying it according to my experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### It should be remembered that the medicine wheel is based on a

<!-- chunk -->

### personal and subjective experience of the world and that there is no true

<!-- chunk -->

### configuration.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Green Tongue

<!-- chunk -->

### A good background in energetic terminology is excellent for developing

<!-- chunk -->

### the intuition as well as an expressive vocabulary. When I was a young

<!-- chunk -->

### man, I was barely able to speak beyond the rudiments of ordinary

<!-- chunk -->

### conversation. I thought in what I would now call “energetic patterns,”

<!-- chunk -->

### and since this was not addressed in conventional education, I had no

<!-- chunk -->

### terminology in which to express my observations. After learning

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic systems or symbols, I was able to talk to other people versed in

<!-- chunk -->

### the same language. This was an improvement, but I couldn’t speak with

<!-- chunk -->

### anyone else. Eventually I was able to translate my thoughts into regular

<!-- chunk -->

### speech and became known as an excellent speaker.

<!-- chunk -->

### The development of speech is related to one’s ability to perceive, and

<!-- chunk -->

### therefore one’s “take on the world” and spiritual life. Consequently,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are stories in folk tradition and literature about changes in spirit

<!-- chunk -->

### and speech. The ballad of Thomas the Rhymer describes how a

<!-- chunk -->

### sympathetic relationship with Nature results in a gift called the “tongue-

<!-- chunk -->

### that-cannot-lie.” The implications of this relationship and gift are more

<!-- chunk -->

### fully developed in commentaries on this ballad by R. J. Stewart in The

<!-- chunk -->

### Underworld Initiation (1985). Another book on gifted speech as a

<!-- chunk -->

### reflection of understanding natural, social, and spiritual processes is

<!-- chunk -->

### found in Linda Sussman’s The Speech of the Grail (1995). This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### commentary on the epic romance Parzival, by Wolfram von Eschenbach.

<!-- chunk -->

### Perhaps the most beautiful name for this gift can be found in David

<!-- chunk -->

### Ovason’s The Secrets of Nostradamus (2001). This name also serves as a

<!-- chunk -->

### description of the special vocabulary used by the old alchemists and

<!-- chunk -->

### philosophers. Through word play, this language came to be known as

<!-- chunk -->

### the langua vert, or “green tongue,” in contrast to the langua ouvert, or

<!-- chunk -->

### “mundane language” of everyday speech.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the green tongue, the old philosophers could represent discoveries

<!-- chunk -->

### about life, the life force, and the ever-changing lessons provided by

<!-- chunk -->

### Mother Nature. It is said that the alchemists used this tongue to couch

<!-- chunk -->

### their wisdom in obscurity so that profane people could not abuse their

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge, or, in a time of Inquisition, their persons. However, a more

<!-- chunk -->

### realistic interpretation would stress the fact that they had to develop a

<!-- chunk -->

### poetic, metaphorical, and suggestive/elusive language in which to

<!-- chunk -->

### convey their discoveries.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mystics or scientists have never claimed that Nature is an open book.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the world of material science, it is a object of intense and long study.

<!-- chunk -->

### Likewise, it is the same when this grand subject of inquiry is examined

<!-- chunk -->

### through the inner eye, intuition, and instinct. The green tongue is not a

<!-- chunk -->

### language to hide, but one that gives expression to that which is hidden

<!-- chunk -->

### and which should, when properly used, evoke understanding from the

<!-- chunk -->

### listening. In bringing understanding from one level to another, speech

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes spiritual, and magical.

<!-- chunk -->

### The great medieval seer, Hildegard von Bingen, called the power of

<!-- chunk -->

### Nature the viriditas or “green power.” She found it in all living things, in

<!-- chunk -->

### the seed ready to burst forth; in youth and sexuality; in the expression of

<!-- chunk -->

### art and creativity; and in the healing power of the green world. Her life

<!-- chunk -->

### as a leader, visionary, musician, artist, and herbal healer was a

<!-- chunk -->

### manifestation of viriditas. Her speech was not obscure, but rather

<!-- chunk -->

### evocative.

<!-- chunk -->

### Originally, the green tongue did not belong to the alchemists or

<!-- chunk -->

### philosophers of Nature, but to the bards and poets. It is thus that

<!-- chunk -->

### Thomas the Rhymer, after having fallen asleep under a hawthorn tree,

<!-- chunk -->

### met with the green clad Queen of Elfland. She bound him to her service,

<!-- chunk -->

### and finding him obedient, rewarded True Thomas with green slippers

<!-- chunk -->

### and “the tongue-that-cannot-lie.”

<!-- chunk -->

### I used to think that the tongue-that-cannot-lie referred to a speaker

<!-- chunk -->

### who could never tell a lie, like the young George Washington, when he

<!-- chunk -->

### chopped down his father’s tree. Later I came to realize that Thomas the

<!-- chunk -->

### Rhymer was a poet and a bard, and that his gift gave him the ability to

<!-- chunk -->

IPPOCRATES

<!-- chunk -->

### he origins of the four elements lie far back in the mists of time,

<!-- chunk -->

### but it was Empedocles who introduced them into Greek

<!-- chunk -->

### philosophy and argued for them as the basis of the world. Plato

<!-- chunk -->

### lent his weight to this view but Aristotle felt that the four elements were

<!-- chunk -->

### derivative. He postulated the four qualities from which they were

<!-- chunk -->

### derived. Thus, fire is hot and dry, air is hot and moist, water is moist and

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, and earth is dry and cold. The four elements subsequently became

<!-- chunk -->

### more of a philosophical or mythological system, while the four qualities

<!-- chunk -->

### were used in the science and medicine of antiquity to describe the

<!-- chunk -->

### attributes of stones, plants, animals, and people.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Hippocratic authors were developing their philosophy at the same

<!-- chunk -->

### time this theory appeared (see quotation at the head of the chapter).

<!-- chunk -->

### However, they disapproved of the four qualities and instead taught a

<!-- chunk -->

### system which depended upon a fasting diet composed of bland foods. By

<!-- chunk -->

### shielding the organism from food which was stressful (too hot, too cold)

<!-- chunk -->

### they hoped to cleanse the body and release toxins during a healing

<!-- chunk -->

### “crisis.” Eventually, Greek medicine adopted both the detoxification fast

<!-- chunk -->

### of the Hippocratic doctors and the four qualities of Aristotle.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Four Qualities

<!-- chunk -->

### To the modern ear, the four qualities appear to be fairly clear-cut.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, the passage of time has altered the way we think about these

<!-- chunk -->

### terms compared to how the ancients defined them. Lacking a

<!-- chunk -->

### thermometer, they had no way of actually measuring hot or cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, they did not define temperature as we would today. Under

<!-- chunk -->

### the circumstances, it was more objective to define the four qualities by

<!-- chunk -->

### their effects.

<!-- chunk -->

### Robert Schmidt, a Greek scholar and translator, of Project Hindsight,

<!-- chunk -->

### in Cumberland, Maryland, helped me define the four qualities according

<!-- chunk -->

### to the ancient concept. The quotations are from Schmidt.

<!-- chunk -->

### Heat is the “active power that takes away, destroys, or eliminates

<!-- chunk -->

### what has a foreign or alien nature, so that the residue is more rarefied or

<!-- chunk -->

### porous, thereby allowing things that are of the same class to become

<!-- chunk -->

### more associated.” At the same time, things that are dissimilar are

<!-- chunk -->

### removed. Heat possesses the power of purification and refinement that

<!-- chunk -->

### intensifies the native identity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cold is the “active power that aggregates, condenses, or packs things

<!-- chunk -->

### more closely together, whether they are of the same or different class; it

<!-- chunk -->

### is a compressive and cohesive power.” It can bind together properties

<!-- chunk -->

### that are opposite and incompatible. Even if similar in nature they are

<!-- chunk -->

### brought together in a way which is not comfortable for them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Damp is defined as the “passive capacity” which allows for pliancy,

<!-- chunk -->

### bendability, and coercibility. Because it is completely coercible, it can

<!-- chunk -->

### easily be “contained or confined by external limits or boundaries.”

<!-- chunk -->

### However, by itself it will not remain within these boundaries. It requires

<!-- chunk -->

### another power to keep it there. Spreading in all directions available to it,

<!-- chunk -->

### damp does not stop until it meets a boundary, where it collects. If no

<!-- chunk -->

### boundary appears, it flows away. Damp lacks the capacity for the

<!-- chunk -->

### “creation of pores or empty spaces” so it collects substances dissimilar to

<!-- chunk -->

### its nature and to each other.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dry is the “passive capacity” that is not pliable but incoercible. It sets

<!-- chunk -->

### boundaries and limitations. “Through its capacity for self-limitation or

<!-- chunk -->

### self-articulation, it admits of the creation of pores or empty spaces.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Thus, entities similar or dissimilar can pass through it without changing

<!-- chunk -->

### its nature. Because it is incoercible, dryness allows for the creation of

<!-- chunk -->

### structure and function.

<!-- chunk -->

### These definitions are quite practical and mechanical. They are not

<!-- chunk -->

### mythological or esoteric. All natural substances are rarified or dense,

<!-- chunk -->

### pliable or rigid. There is nothing inherently unscientific about this

<!-- chunk -->

### analytical method—it is just not how we are encouraged to think at the

<!-- chunk -->

### present time. The modern mind looks for ultimate particles and thinks

<!-- chunk -->

### that it has isolated something more true and useful than a mere pattern.

<!-- chunk -->

### The four qualities are further subdivided into the four degrees. These

<!-- chunk -->

### do not refer to degrees of temperature as on a thermometer the way we

<!-- chunk -->

### would think about it today. They represent distinct categories of action,

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing in intensity from mild to strong. Classification of an herb by

<!-- chunk -->

### temperature and degree does not necessary reflect the actual taste or

<!-- chunk -->

### sensation produced on the tongue by this herb. A plant that actually

<!-- chunk -->

### tastes hot may not have a hot medical value. It is the action or property

<!-- chunk -->

### of the plant, not the taste or sensation, which determines whether or not

<!-- chunk -->

### it is hot. Ultimately, the qualities are actually abstractions of the

<!-- chunk -->

### everyday experience of hot, cold, damp, and dry. This discrepancy must

<!-- chunk -->

### have led to confusion and contributed to the downfall of Greek

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Four Degrees

<!-- chunk -->

### The following are the chief actions of herbal remedies classified by

<!-- chunk -->

### quality and degree (Nicholas Culpeper, A Key to Galen’s Method of

<!-- chunk -->

### Physick, reprint 1990, 376).

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot

<!-- chunk -->

## • First degree. Opens pores to expel moisture by perspiration or other

<!-- chunk -->

### channels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Second degree. Thins fluids so that they can better pass through

<!-- chunk -->

### pores and channels.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Third degree. Increases the internal heat of digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, so that the body stays warm and the perspiration is

<!-- chunk -->

### driven outward toward the surface. (Note the relationship to

<!-- chunk -->

### Aristotle’s idea of heat being rarifying and making things more

<!-- chunk -->

### porous).

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fourth degree. Burns the skin. These agents are used externally to

<!-- chunk -->

### awaken organs and functions that are blocked or inactive (cold,

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed) and to burn away tumors.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold

<!-- chunk -->

## • First degree. Lessen heat from exposure to the sun. Salad greens are

<!-- chunk -->

### considered cold in the first degree.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Second degree. Thickens fluids and reduces internal heat.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Third degree. Restrains the outward flow of fluids and matters.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fourth degree. Prevents “vapors” from rising upwards. Vapors are

<!-- chunk -->

### analogous to “rebellious qi” in traditional Chinese medicine. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### energy that is rising upward against the flow of nature. They include

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive coughing, vomiting, and menstrual cramps. Dizziness,

<!-- chunk -->

### fainting, swooning, hysteria, and PMS can be caused by vapors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Agents cold in the fourth degree stupefy the senses to ease violent

<!-- chunk -->

### pain and reduce mania, nervousness, restlessness, and insomnia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Damp

<!-- chunk -->

## • First degree. Causes substances to move through internal passages.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Second degree. Moistens and lubricates surfaces.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Third degree. Reduces hardness.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fourth degree. Nourishes the flesh.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dry

<!-- chunk -->

## • First degree. Restrains the outflow of fluid when it is too extreme.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Second degree. Removes excess fluids when there is too much

<!-- chunk -->

### dampness.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Third degree. “Comforts and strengthens nature.” This phrase means

<!-- chunk -->

### that they protect the surface against wind and cold by closing the

<!-- chunk -->

### pores. Open pores cause sweating and chilling.

<!-- chunk -->

## • Fourth degree. Stops continuous, life threatening discharges, as in

<!-- chunk -->

### tuberculosis and dysentery.

<!-- chunk -->

## Temperate

<!-- chunk -->

### Remedies that are temperate (equal with regard to one of the two

<!-- chunk -->

### polarities: hot/cold or damp/dry) help to maintain the body in a

<!-- chunk -->

### condition where there is no apparent excess. They are not graded

<!-- chunk -->

### by degree. Remember that the Hippocratic physicians sought out

<!-- chunk -->

### bland substances. The temperate degree is virtually the opposite

<!-- chunk -->

### of wind.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here are some examples of the classification of plants by the four

<!-- chunk -->

### qualities taken from the pages of William Salmon’s English Herbal (1709).

<!-- chunk -->

### (I have eliminated the excessive use of capitalization which otherwise

<!-- chunk -->

### makes Salmon difficult to read, but have otherwise presented the

<!-- chunk -->

### material in the idiom of its time).

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot and Dry

<!-- chunk -->

## Nettle (Urtica dioeca). Hot and dry in the first degree. “It does not burn

<!-- chunk -->

### and sting, because of its extream heat, but because its downy or small

<!-- chunk -->

### prickles are hard and stiff.” This illustrates that “heat” is not the same

<!-- chunk -->

### thing as heat, as we would experience it, but is rather a category of

<!-- chunk -->

### action. Here it means “stimulating.” Nettle juice “taken inwardly to three

<!-- chunk -->

### or four ounces or more, according to age, it will make the belly soluble;

<!-- chunk -->

### it opens obstructions of the stomach and lungs; helps wheezing and

<!-- chunk -->

### shortness of breath; it provokes the term, allays vapors, and prevents

<!-- chunk -->

### hysterick fits; it provokes urine and expels sand, gravel, and tartarous

<!-- chunk -->

### matter out of the reins and bladder. It kills worms in children, eases and

<!-- chunk -->

### takes away stitches in the side, removes the oppilation of the spleen

<!-- chunk -->

### expelling the windiness therof; and is said also to provoke to venery;

<!-- chunk -->

### being taken for two or three days together it stops spitting or vomiting

<!-- chunk -->

### blood, coming from the lungs or stomach; being put into green wounds

<!-- chunk -->

### or old sores, it cleanses them and induces their healing.” The ancients

<!-- chunk -->

### seem not to have valued the nutritive qualities of nettle, which would

<!-- chunk -->

### make it moist rather than dry.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris). Hot and dry in the second degree. “It is

<!-- chunk -->

### prevalent against vapors and fits of the mother [uterus]: it powerfully

<!-- chunk -->

### provokes the terms, brings away both birth and afterbirth, and expels

<!-- chunk -->

### the dead child; it is good against the palsie, as also cramps and

<!-- chunk -->

### convulsions, it cures the strangury, as also the poyson of the black

<!-- chunk -->

### poppy.” The properties mentioned are predominately heating.

<!-- chunk -->

## Catnip (Nepeta cataria). Hot and dry in the third degree. “It provokes

<!-- chunk -->

### the terms in women, hastens and facilitates the labor, stops catarrhs and

<!-- chunk -->

### cold thin rheums, expels wind, gives ease in the colick, cures asthmas of

<!-- chunk -->

### difficulty breathing, as also cramps, convulsions, and all cold and moist

<!-- chunk -->

### disaffections of the nerves.” Most of the mints are classified as hot and

<!-- chunk -->

### dry in the third degree.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Hot and dry in the third degree. “It

<!-- chunk -->

### prevails against the head-ach and megrim, from a cold cause; the

<!-- chunk -->

### vertigo, lethargy, epilepsy, apoplexy, palsy, convulsions, catarrhs,

<!-- chunk -->

### drowsiness, dullness of the senses, loss of memory, coldness of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach, stinking breath, wind in the stomach and bowels, dimness of

<!-- chunk -->

### the sight, jaundice, obstructions of the terms, gout from a cold cause, all

<!-- chunk -->

### external pains and aches from a cold and moist cause, lameness,

<!-- chunk -->

### numbedness, weakness of the joints; and in contagious times, prevails

<!-- chunk -->

### even against the plague it self and all contagious and infectious

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Mustard (Sinapis alba). The seed is hot and dry in the fourth degree—

<!-- chunk -->

### i.e., it will burn the skin. “It is found by experience to be of especial use,

<!-- chunk -->

### to provoke the terms in women, provoke urine, and give ease in the

<!-- chunk -->

### strangury, stone and gravel: it cures hysterick fits, pains of the sides and

<!-- chunk -->

### spleen, tooth-ach, kings evil, gout, cramp, and convulsions of the bowels;

<!-- chunk -->

### and prevails also against agues, epilepsy, lethargy, carus, vertigo, expels

<!-- chunk -->

### poison of all sorts, is good against impotency in men, and removes

<!-- chunk -->

### scabbiness, and other defedations of the skin.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot and Moist

<!-- chunk -->

## Madonna Lily (Lilium candidum). “ ’Tis the roots of Lillies which are

<!-- chunk -->

### chiefly used; but both roots and flowers are hot and moist in the first

<!-- chunk -->

### degree.” The juice of the root, “stamped and strained out with wine (for

<!-- chunk -->

### it is of too slimy a substance of itself) and given to drink for some few

<!-- chunk -->

### days together, it expels the poyson and malignity of the plague or

<!-- chunk -->

### pestilence, and causes it to break forth into blisters on the outward parts

<!-- chunk -->

### of the skin, as has been found by Experience.” The flowers extracted in

<!-- chunk -->

### olive oil in the sunlight, or gently warmed, make an oil which is

<!-- chunk -->

### “emollient, and softens the hardness of the nerves, and extends sinews

<!-- chunk -->

### shrunk; it also softens the hardness of the womb.” The roots are applied

<!-- chunk -->

### to “tumors and apostems of the privy parts.” I have used a tincture of

<!-- chunk -->

### Easter lily flowers to cure cysts of the ovaries and breasts dozens of

<!-- chunk -->

### times when I have been unable to obtain Madonna lily. One would think

<!-- chunk -->

### this plant cooling and moist, but its action on putrid heat shows that it is

<!-- chunk -->

### more warming or stimulating.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold and Dry

<!-- chunk -->

## Raspberry (Rubus strigosus). “The roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and

<!-- chunk -->

### unripe fruit are cold and drying in the first degree.… They stop fluxes of

<!-- chunk -->

### the belly, and bleeding in the inward parts; are good against the

<!-- chunk -->

### overflowing of the courses in women; they cure sores and ulcers of the

<!-- chunk -->

### throat, mouth, and other parts, are profitable against the bitings of

<!-- chunk -->

### serpents, and cure the stomacace, or scurvy, being used according to art,

<!-- chunk -->

### for some considerable time.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Plantain (Plantago spp.) The leaves are cold and dry in the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### first degree. “It is dry without biting, and cold without benumming.” It

<!-- chunk -->

### “heals the excoriations of the stomach and other bowels, stops catarrhs,

<!-- chunk -->

### and all sorts of fluxes in man or woman. It stops also all sorts of

<!-- chunk -->

### haemorrhages whether internal or external, the overflowing of the

<!-- chunk -->

### courses in women, spitting and pissing of blood, and therefore is of

<!-- chunk -->

### excellent use in the curing of a phthisis [tuberculosis] or ulceration of

<!-- chunk -->

### the lungs.” Today plantain is classified as a mucilage, thus moistening

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than drying.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rose (Rosa gallica). “Both the white and red are cooling and drying, but

<!-- chunk -->

### the white is taken to exceed the red in both these properties.” They are

<!-- chunk -->

### cold in the first degree and drying in the second. “The white and red,

<!-- chunk -->

### stop fluxes of the bowels, and catarrhs, and vulnerary, drying and

<!-- chunk -->

### healing, good against consumptions and ulcers of the lungs, as also

<!-- chunk -->

### internal ulcers of the other viscera, as of the stomach, gutts, reins,

<!-- chunk -->

### bladder, and womb, comfort the head, brain, and nerves, and are good

<!-- chunk -->

### against diseases afflicting those parts, proceeding from cold and

<!-- chunk -->

### moisture.” The wild roses (Rosa canina) “are much the same” in virtue.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold and Moist

<!-- chunk -->

## Blue violet (Viola odorata). Cool and moist in the first degree. “Violets

<!-- chunk -->

### cool the heat of fevers, allay inflammations in the throat and lungs, are

<!-- chunk -->

### profitable in the beginning of a quinsie and pleurisie, and are said to

<!-- chunk -->

### help the falling-sickness in children.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Wild Lettuce (Lactuca virosa). “Wild Lettice is cold in the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### second degree, and moist in the end of the first. It has nearly the same

<!-- chunk -->

### Properties of Cooling which the Garden Kind has; but the bitterness of

<!-- chunk -->

### this makes it the more aperitive; and yet it is more somniferous than the

<!-- chunk -->

### manured sorts, and comes up, as it is thought by some, almost to the

<!-- chunk -->

### degree of Opium; but this Opinion I can never assent to, my Experience

<!-- chunk -->

### having proved the contrary.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Watermelon (Cucurbita citrullus). The fruit and the seed are cold and

<!-- chunk -->

### moist in the second degree, “the seeds being reckoned one of the four

<!-- chunk -->

### cold seeds.” The fruit is “usually eaten raw, being pared from the rind

<!-- chunk -->

### and cut in slices or pieces. It cools and refrigerates admirably, quenches

<!-- chunk -->

### thirst, refreshes the spirits, abates the heat of the most burning and

<!-- chunk -->

### malign fevers, cleanses the bowels, provokes urines, takes away the heat

<!-- chunk -->

### and scalding thereof, and gives ease in the strangury.” The seed “takes

<!-- chunk -->

### away the febritick distemper of the blood; it gives ease in the strangury,

<!-- chunk -->

### abates the heart and scalding of the urine, and cures pissing of blood,

<!-- chunk -->

### and represses lust (being used for some time) in an admirable manner.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Dry

<!-- chunk -->

## Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria). Dry in the first degree, but

<!-- chunk -->

### temperate with respect to hot or cold. “It stops bleeding, and cures fluxes

<!-- chunk -->

### of the bowels of all sorts, stops the whites and terms in women, and

<!-- chunk -->

### gives ease in the colick and gripings of the guts. And heals wounds and

<!-- chunk -->

### old ulcers.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Yellow Dock (Rumex crispus). Dry in the second degree and temperate

<!-- chunk -->

### with regard to hot or cold. “The whole plant is very astringent and

<!-- chunk -->

### abstersive, with a kind of opening faculty; and is traumatick or vulnerary

<!-- chunk -->

### and hepatick.” As a result, “it is peculiar for curing all fluxes of the

<!-- chunk -->

### bowels, chiefly the bloody-flux,” i.e., dysentery. The juice of the root

<!-- chunk -->

### “opens obstructions of the liver and spleen, cleanses and strengthens the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach and other viscera, stops a diarrhea and lienteria, and heals the

<!-- chunk -->

### corrosion of the guts in a dysenteria, strengthening them admirably, and

<!-- chunk -->

### prevails against the jaundice after a singular manner.” The old authors

<!-- chunk -->

### emphasize the use of yellow dock root in diarrhea, while the new

<!-- chunk -->

### emphasize it as a mild laxative because it contains some anthroquinones.

<!-- chunk -->

### I agree with the old authors here; I also think yellow dock is cooling.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tormentil (Potentilla tormentilla). Dry in the third degree and slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### warm, not quite approaching the first degree. The other cinquefoils are

<!-- chunk -->

### classified as dry in the third degree and temperate with regard to hot

<!-- chunk -->

### and cold. “It stops all fluxes of blood or humors in man or woman,

<!-- chunk -->

### whether at nose, mouth, belly, or any wound in any part; resists all

<!-- chunk -->

### poison, and the plague or pestilence it self, and all pestilential diseases,

<!-- chunk -->

### and such as are infectious, as the measles, smallpox, purples, spotted

<!-- chunk -->

### fever, by expelling thro’ a gentle diaphoresis, the malignity from the

<!-- chunk -->

### heart.” The primary property is astringent, or drying, but the actions

<!-- chunk -->

### cited would suggest it is also warming.

<!-- chunk -->

## Moist

<!-- chunk -->

## Marshmallow (Althea officinalis). Moist in the first degree, temperate

<!-- chunk -->

### with respect to hot or cold. “They expel tartarous mucilage out of the

<!-- chunk -->

### breast and lungs, as also from the guts, reins, and womb; are profitable

<!-- chunk -->

### against the bloody flux; and prevails against the stone and gravel,

<!-- chunk -->

### whether in the reins, ureters, or bladder.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Temperate

<!-- chunk -->

## Self Heal (Prunella vulgaris). “Temperate in respect to heat or coldness,

<!-- chunk -->

### dryness or moisture, yet rather enclining to dryness.” The ointment “is

<!-- chunk -->

### good for all sorts of simple contusions, hurts, sores, wounds, and ulcers,

<!-- chunk -->

### in any parts of the body. It also helps to consolidate broken bones; and

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthens and confirm such as have been lately out of Joint, and newly

<!-- chunk -->

### reduced. It heals also sores and ulcers, in the secret parts of man or

<!-- chunk -->

### woman.” The leaves worked up with a knife quickly form a mucilage, so

<!-- chunk -->

### it is surprising that this remedy is classified as dry. The idea is probably

<!-- chunk -->

### that it is drying because it stops bleeding.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sweet Woodruff (Asperula spp.) “Woodroof is temperate in respect of

<!-- chunk -->

### heat or cold, dryness or moisture; and is very like in Qualities to our

<!-- chunk -->

### Ladies-Bedstraw.” It will “chear the heart, resist melancholy, make a

<!-- chunk -->

### man lightsom and pleasant, and induce the curing of wounds.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Remember that temperate remedies bring things back to the norm.

<!-- chunk -->

### The classification of the plants according to the four qualities often

<!-- chunk -->

### agrees with modern ideas about their use, but there are sometimes areas

<!-- chunk -->

### of disagreement. For instance, mucilages, which we would consider

<!-- chunk -->

### moistening, are classified as drying. This is because they glue together

<!-- chunk -->

### the lips of a wound and prevent bleeding or fluid loss. Thus, comfrey

<!-- chunk -->

### and plantain are considered to be drying when we would consider them

<!-- chunk -->

### to be mucilaginous and moistening. Oily plants are not valued for their

<!-- chunk -->

### moistening or nourishing effects at all. Thus, fenugreek and anise are

<!-- chunk -->

### considered hot and dry.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tendency to view remedies which stop bleeding as drying was

<!-- chunk -->

### carried over into nineteenth-century herbalism. Antihemor-rhagics were

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristically classed as astringents. However, there are other ways

<!-- chunk -->

### in which herbs can stop bleeding. Thus, we find fleabane classified as an

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent when it is about the most peppery hot plant native to the

<!-- chunk -->

### fields of North America. Stimulants stop bleeding quickly by opening up

<!-- chunk -->

### the peripheral circulation and taking the blood away from the area of

<!-- chunk -->

### the wound. This is certainly the mode of action for herbs like fleabane,

<!-- chunk -->

### yarrow, cayenne, and shepherd’s purse.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Four Qualities as Pathology

<!-- chunk -->

### The four qualities are used to classify medicinal activity. Herbs are then

<!-- chunk -->

### applied by contrary, or hot to cold. The following definitions of the

<!-- chunk -->

### pathological states to which medicines are applied are somewhat more

<!-- chunk -->

### pragmatic than the abstract approach described above.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hot. Red, swollen, tender, hot tissues; excess of blood to an area,

<!-- chunk -->

### producing redness, heat, and fullness; excessive function, accelerated

<!-- chunk -->

### function, from richness of blood, hence excessive pain from over-

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation and swelling; pulse rapid and superficial; tongue red,

<!-- chunk -->

### elongated, flame-like. It should be observed that since heat is rarifying

<!-- chunk -->

### and purifying, as a pathological condition it is producing an intense

<!-- chunk -->

### expression of self-identity and is similar to what we would today call

<!-- chunk -->

### auto-immune over-activity.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold. Tissues cool, flaccid, pale or darkish, inactive, insensate;

<!-- chunk -->

### diminished circulation resulting in pallor or dark complexion from

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation, cold, and lack of sensation from lack of stimulation;

<!-- chunk -->

### depression of senses and functions; pulse deep, slow; tongue dark red,

<!-- chunk -->

### blue, purple, gray, black or pale. Cold weakens the innate type or

<!-- chunk -->

### identity of the organism, bringing it into contact with forces and

<!-- chunk -->

### substances which are in opposition or unfriendly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Damp. In Greek medicine there are two kinds of dampness. The first

<!-- chunk -->

### corresponds to a state where the tissues are saggy, inelastic, pores open,

<!-- chunk -->

### with active discharge of fluids; pulse relaxed; tongue damp. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### second state the dampness is stuck so that tissues are soggy, flabby,

<!-- chunk -->

### damp, and the fluids are thickened and phlegmy; pulse obscure (from

<!-- chunk -->

### dampness obscuring the beat); tongue coated.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dry. The condition is one of dryness, withering, weakness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### (frequently) pallor from lack of fluids to moisten and bring in food;

<!-- chunk -->

### functions are reduced, energy deficient, tissues dried, withered, and

<!-- chunk -->

### finally hardened; pulse weak, slightly tense; tongue dry. The dry quality

<!-- chunk -->

### produces rigidity and brittleness. In health, dryness creates the

<!-- chunk -->

### opportunity for different functions to occur, since it sets boundaries and

<!-- chunk -->

### limitations, but in disease these functions become weak and ineffective.

<!-- chunk -->

### Practitioners abandoned Greek medicine in the late seventeenth

<!-- chunk -->

### century. It was replaced by the “theory of irritation,” which led to the

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state model of the nineteenth century, described in the following

<!-- chunk -->

### chapter.

# A

<!-- chunk -->

### If the student can be made to understand the principles of scientific

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of tissue-states … his judgment as to prescribing comes

<!-- chunk -->

### to him as if by intuition, and can scarcely be wrong.

<!-- chunk -->

HURSTON

<!-- chunk -->

### fter the demise of Greek medicine, Western physicians adopted

<!-- chunk -->

### the “irritation theory.” Founded on the observation that nerves

<!-- chunk -->

### react to stimulation, even after dissection and removal, treatment

<!-- chunk -->

### was based on stimulating or sedating the irritable nature of the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism. This led to the creation of two classes of medicines similar to

<!-- chunk -->

### the classes of heating and cooling in Greek medicine. Thus, practice

<!-- chunk -->

### continued in a similar vein, but based on a different theory. In folk

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, these two categories were thought of as hot and cold.

<!-- chunk -->

### Samuel Thomson taught that there were three types of disease: hot,

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, and alternating hot and cold. This reflected the fact that many

<!-- chunk -->

### Americans at that time suffered from malaria, which is characterized by

<!-- chunk -->

### alternating chills and fever. Dr. Alvah Curtis, the founder of

<!-- chunk -->

### physiomedicalism or reformed Thomsonianism, translated these three

<!-- chunk -->

### basic imbalances into scientific lingo. He taught that the three basic

<!-- chunk -->

### types of disease were based on the reaction of biological tissue to

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation. There are three phases: irritation, contraction, and

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the nineteenth century, doctors of all schools used such terms to

<!-- chunk -->

### define basic physiological imbalances. Since the emerging scientific

<!-- chunk -->

### model was not based on mythic elements or humors, no attempt was

<!-- chunk -->

### made to put these terms into an overall classification scheme. Definitions

<!-- chunk -->

### were personal and vague, but adequate for professional communication.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1900, Dr. Joseph M. Thurston published an ambitious tome called

<!-- chunk -->

### The Philosophy of Physiomedicalism in which he defined six primary

<!-- chunk -->

### physiological imbalances or “tissue states,” as he called them. The terms

<!-- chunk -->

### which he chose to represent these states are excessively complex, so we

<!-- chunk -->

### will bypass them here and use ones which were more characteristic of

<!-- chunk -->

### the medical terminology of all schools at that time: irritation or

<!-- chunk -->

### excitation, constriction, relaxation, atrophy, torpor, and depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thurston’s theory survived in a modified form in the United Kingdom.

<!-- chunk -->

### A.W. Priest and L.R. Priest (1982, 31) refer to the “balance of function”

<!-- chunk -->

### between “contraction and relaxation, stimulation and sedation.” They

<!-- chunk -->

### also use the term “atrophy.” This theory, based as it is on actual

<!-- chunk -->

### physiology, is more compatible with the modern perspective, yet it is not

<!-- chunk -->

### incompatible with the ancient. It can serve as a language of energetics

<!-- chunk -->

### and a conceptual bridge. This is the basic system that will be used in The

<!-- chunk -->

### Practice of Traditional Western Herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

### In order to elaborate the six tissue states, I have drawn from the

<!-- chunk -->

### literature of the great, nineteenth-century botanical doctors, including

<!-- chunk -->

### Samuel Thomson, Wooster Beach, Alvah Curtis, William Cook, Joseph M.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thurston, John M. Scudder, John William Fyfe, and others. I have

<!-- chunk -->

### quoted from them liberally to illustrate some concepts, while at other

<!-- chunk -->

### times I have brought them up to date by referring to more contemporary

<!-- chunk -->

### ideas.

<!-- chunk -->

## Heat • Excitation

<!-- chunk -->

### This tissue state represents an “exaggeration of the normal function-rate”

<!-- chunk -->

### of the tissues (Thurston, 1900, 264). “The condition of the part is one of

<!-- chunk -->

### excitation. The symptoms are very clear—there is swelling, heat,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased sensitiveness, and redness” (Scudder, 1874, 320). These are

<!-- chunk -->

### the classic symptoms of inflammation, but we do not use that term

<!-- chunk -->

### because inflammation can arise from several different tissue states. The

<!-- chunk -->

### term irritation is also used in the old literature but this has been avoided

<!-- chunk -->

### because many things other than heat can irritate tissues. Excitation

<!-- chunk -->

### represents an excess in the innate heat of the tissues. They are red, full,

<!-- chunk -->

### and tender because blood increases cellular activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### Characteristic symptoms of excitation include: temperature rise;

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous excitement; restlessness; wakefulness; excessive movement;

<!-- chunk -->

### susceptibility to stimulation; bright eyes; increased allergic response;

<!-- chunk -->

### heightened sensitivity to pain; sharp pain; fever; redness; swelling of the

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues; engorgement of blood; pink-red tissue color; an elongated, flame-

<!-- chunk -->

### shaped, pink-red or carmine tongue; excited vascular movements;

<!-- chunk -->

### capillary fragility; bleeding; tendencies to increased blood pressure; and

<!-- chunk -->

### a superficial, bounding, or rapid pulse. This tissue state especially

<!-- chunk -->

### damages the heart and circulatory system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Wind • Constriction

<!-- chunk -->

### When nerves are stimulated they contract. If they remain too long in this

<!-- chunk -->

### condition there will be constriction or tension in the organism. This

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state is the result of “abnormal contraction (clonic spasm) of the

<!-- chunk -->

### neuromuscular system” (Thurston, 1900, 267).

<!-- chunk -->

### Constriction may result from psychological or physical tension.

<!-- chunk -->

### Inability to relax and switch from sympathetic (awake, alert) to

<!-- chunk -->

### parasympathetic (rest, digest) is a common cause. However, tension can

<!-- chunk -->

### just as easily arise from physiological stress. When the body is chilled,

<!-- chunk -->

### the hypothalamus signals the sympathetic to start the shivering

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism in the extremities to warm up the body. It also stands the

<!-- chunk -->

### hairs on end. If these mechanisms get stuck (which is often the case after

<!-- chunk -->

### influenza or malaria), the body remains too much on the sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### side or alternates back and forth between tension and relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alternating chills and fever are a characteristic symptom of the tensive

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state. These were called “intermittent chills” in the old literature.

<!-- chunk -->

### Characteristic symptoms of constriction are neuromuscular tension;

<!-- chunk -->

### spasm; rigidity or convulsion; symptom changes which are sudden,

<!-- chunk -->

### intermittent, irregular, or alternating; chills alternating with fever;

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea with constipation; pain with freedom from pain; and a pulse

<!-- chunk -->

### wiry, tense, resistant, hard, blocked, or obstructed. Usually, there is

<!-- chunk -->

### aggravation from getting chilled, drinking cold water, or a draft of cold

<!-- chunk -->

### air. Tension especially affects the digestion, gall bladder, and liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dry • Atrophy

<!-- chunk -->

### Thurston used this word to indicate a lack of trophism or function. It

<!-- chunk -->

### also applies to an underfed, withered, weak condition. Both usages are

<!-- chunk -->

### correct, since undernourished tissues have less energy to function.

<!-- chunk -->

### Atrophy should also be associated with dryness because fluids carry

<!-- chunk -->

### food. Without them, there is no nutrition. This includes both water and

<!-- chunk -->

### oil, both of which move foodstuffs to the cells and waste products out of

<!-- chunk -->

### them. Well-nourished tissue holds more water and oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water is the great medium for transportation within the body. Many

<!-- chunk -->

### substances, however, are not water-soluble but fat-soluble, so the body

<!-- chunk -->

### also requires lipids to allow complete movement and feeding. Several

<!-- chunk -->

### important hormones (thyroxine, aldosterone, cortisone, and sex

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones) are composed of lipids and require lipid carrier cells to travel.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without water and oil, cells dry, harden, and lose their function. Tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### become sclerotic or scarred due to lack of nutrition. Hormonal functions

<!-- chunk -->

### are reduced.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dryness and malnutrition affects the nerves as well as the endocrine

<!-- chunk -->

### system. A common symptom of atrophy is nervous exhaustion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nineteenth-and early twentieth-century literature would frequently use

<!-- chunk -->

### the words asthenic (thin, weak) or neurasthenic (weak nervous system) to

<!-- chunk -->

### describe this condition. In neurasthenia the person is exhausted from

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulation. They do not have the reserves to recover easily from mental

<!-- chunk -->

### or physical exertion. While atrophy tends to produce a thin, dried out,

<!-- chunk -->

### emaciated frame, there are numerous instances where we find heavy,

<!-- chunk -->

### overweight people whose tissues are dried out and malnourished.

<!-- chunk -->

### The characteristic symptoms of atrophy include a dry tongue. In

<!-- chunk -->

### advanced cases, it may be narrow, thin, withered, or cracked, but it will

<!-- chunk -->

### always be dry. It can also be red from heat caused by a lack of fluids, or

<!-- chunk -->

### pale from lack of nutrition. The pulse is usually weak, enfeebled, low,

<!-- chunk -->

### uneven (scrapes along), and sometimes weakly tense on the patient’s left

<!-- chunk -->

### wrist. The skin is dry and rough, lacking oil, or water, or both. Skin

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions (acne, eczema, and psoriasis) are very common. There may be

<!-- chunk -->

### oozing from the skin as it cracks and opens up, but the general condition

<!-- chunk -->

### is one of dryness. The sensation given by dry, atrophic skin is like that

<!-- chunk -->

### given by running a finger across the end of a book.

<!-- chunk -->

### When tissues are dehydrated the lack of fluids can give rise to heat.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is called “hectic fever” in the old Western literature. It is described

<!-- chunk -->

### in traditional Chinese medicine as “phantom,” or “false heat,” or “yin

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency.” The characteristic symptoms are a rapid, nonresistant pulse

<!-- chunk -->

### and red flushing across the checks—the hectic or malarial flush. Tension

<!-- chunk -->

### can also arise from lack of fluids. This is another symptom of “uprushing

<!-- chunk -->

### yang” from “lack of yin,” or “yin not holding down the yang.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold • Depression

<!-- chunk -->

### This tissue state is the opposite of irritation. Tissues are under-stimulated

<!-- chunk -->

### or incapable of responding to stimulation. There is a lack of oxidation in

<!-- chunk -->

### the cells. Cellular life is diminished so there is hypo-function, tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### deterioration, and retention of waste products and even unused

<!-- chunk -->

### foodstuffs. This represents a golden opportunity for bacteria to enter the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. They are not so much invading as helping to rid the body of

<!-- chunk -->

### superfluous material. Conversely, invasion by foreign bacteria, parasites,

<!-- chunk -->

### venom, poisons, heavy metals, or toxic chemicals depresses cellular life

<!-- chunk -->

### and induces tissue depression. Bacteria and parasites secrete exotoxins

<!-- chunk -->

### that suppress the cell life of the host, so that they can create an

<!-- chunk -->

### environment where they are healthy. Thus, there is a cumulative or

<!-- chunk -->

### ongoing effect.

<!-- chunk -->

### The body attempts to deal with the bacteria by increasing white cell

<!-- chunk -->

### production (hence, the high white cell counts). This results in the

<!-- chunk -->

### production of pus (a mixture of dead bacteria and white cells). In a

<!-- chunk -->

### healthier body, these find a vent, a boil or fistula, through which to

<!-- chunk -->

### discharge. In a sicker body, they discharge into the bloodstream, causing

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic poisoning or septicemia. There are low-grade fevers and

<!-- chunk -->

### infections with putrefaction, venting of pus, fatigue, exhaustion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### easy infection of wounds. The bone marrow, stem cells, and lymphatic

<!-- chunk -->

### system are eventually worn out trying to keep up with the bacteria and

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins, resulting in low immunity. The defenses against aberrant cell

<!-- chunk -->

### growths are down and cancer is more likely.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although the oxidation rate in the cells is low, in the spaces between

<!-- chunk -->

### the cells it is higher, because of the scavenging by bacteria. This creates

<!-- chunk -->

### a condition of “heat from cold,” or heat from cellular inactivity. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### the opposite of “heat from heat,” or the heat of cellular over-activity in

<!-- chunk -->

### the irritated tissue state. As a consequence, antioxidants are used for

<!-- chunk -->

### both conditions, even though completely non-holistic modern

<!-- chunk -->

### practitioners are incapable of differentiating the conditions where one

<!-- chunk -->

### antioxidant would be useful instead of another.

<!-- chunk -->

### Antibiotics kill one kind of bacteria, but unbalance the microflora of

<!-- chunk -->

### the colon, creating other types of bacterial imbalance and generation of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxins. They also do not remove the toxins that remain behind in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body after the bacteria are killed. This is why people who have had

<!-- chunk -->

### parasites or amoebae in the colon often experience a feeling as if they

<!-- chunk -->

### were still present, even after they have been killed by drugs The dragon

<!-- chunk -->

### tracks are still present. There is a further, very serious side effect of

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotic treatment. When bacteria are killed they release endotoxins

<!-- chunk -->

### from inside themselves which otherwise would never enter the

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream. These cause additional poisoning of the body. In fact, if the

<!-- chunk -->

### bacterial die-off is high enough, there may be a “septic shock” resulting

<!-- chunk -->

### in sudden death. The appropriate way to kill bacteria is to assist the

<!-- chunk -->

### body in removing the toxins that support bacterial or parasitical life.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is generally the way herbs work. The attempt to kill bacteria with

<!-- chunk -->

### “natural antibiotic” herbs is an entirely misguided imitation of a deeply

<!-- chunk -->

### flawed biomedical model.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the depressed tissue state, circulation is usually retarded so that

<!-- chunk -->

### there is a lack of circulation to the extremities, resulting in cold hands

<!-- chunk -->

### and feet. As a result, the old doctors gave this symptom the highest

<!-- chunk -->

### importance, not necessarily as a cardiovascular symptom (which it

<!-- chunk -->

### usually affects eventually), but as an indication of the general tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### condition. The extremities include the entire capillary bed, where the

<!-- chunk -->

### force of blood pressure pushes the contents of the blood out into the

<!-- chunk -->

### interstitial fluids surrounding the cells. Blood pressure may be low,

<!-- chunk -->

### though often blockages in the portal vein or elsewhere lead to high

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

### If circulation is weak, oxygen and blood sugar, and even water, will

<!-- chunk -->

### have a hard time getting to the capillaries, and from there to the cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### This causes the depression of cell life. In the spaces around the cells

<!-- chunk -->

### there is retention of carbon dioxide, since return circulation is also weak.

<!-- chunk -->

### This results in a generally acid condition in the internal tissues. Acids,

<!-- chunk -->

### the treatment for excess heat, are detrimental in depression. (That is

<!-- chunk -->

### why, in Ayurvedic medicine, acids are considered to be heat generating;

<!-- chunk -->

### this is only true in “heat from cold”). This includes acid-generating foods

<!-- chunk -->

### such as meat and protein.

<!-- chunk -->

### When there is a lack of strong peripheral circulation—or a lack of the

<!-- chunk -->

### “determining powers,” in the phraseology of the old doctors—rashes

<!-- chunk -->

### recede to the interior, inflicting themselves on the nerves and viscera

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than coming out through the skin. Retrocession of the rash in

<!-- chunk -->

### smallpox was a very serious problem for the old doctors. Even today it

<!-- chunk -->

### still occurs in chicken pox and can be fatal. (It also occurs from

<!-- chunk -->

### vaccination, causing terrible havoc in sensitive children). The old

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment was to give stimulants (saffron and safflower were favorites)

<!-- chunk -->

### to bring out the rash. In homeopathy, Thuja (cedar) is used to bring out

<!-- chunk -->

### the vaccination.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another result of poor peripheral circulation and low oxygenation of

<!-- chunk -->

### the cells is heavy, thick, coagulated blood. This results in the typical

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of “congealed blood” recognized in traditional Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. (Congealed blood can also be due to relaxation causing local

<!-- chunk -->

### collection and coagulation of blood. Sometimes it is also due to

<!-- chunk -->

### constriction). There is often a blue/red, or blue/yellow, or blue/black

<!-- chunk -->

### complexion around the veins, which are more visible. Blood from

<!-- chunk -->

### hemorrhaging or menstruation is thick, clotted, dark, oozing.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have, seemingly, jumped over the simplest expression of

<!-- chunk -->

### depression. Cold from the environment will reduce cellular activity. The

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothalamus reacts with shivering and fever to return the organism to

<!-- chunk -->

### health. If the organism does not adequately respond, there will be

<!-- chunk -->

### “internal cold” or depression. If it gets stuck in the shivering phase there

<!-- chunk -->

### will be tissue constriction. If it gets stuck in the fever stage there will be

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue irritation. Accordingly, a chill or cold from the environment needs

<!-- chunk -->

### to be treated according to the stage it is moving through or the tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### state where it gets stuck.

<!-- chunk -->

### The characteristic symptoms of depression include a feeling of internal

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, as if one cannot get it out of the body; hands and feet cold; skin

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, dry and inactive, due to poor peripheral circulation; tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### deterioration and bacterial feeding; tendency to secondary, septic or

<!-- chunk -->

### putrefactive heat with discharges that are yellow, green, brown or black;

<!-- chunk -->

### skin color darkish—dusky red, blue, purple, brown, yellow or black;

<!-- chunk -->

### pulse deep, weak, or slow until putrefactive fever sets in, in which case

<!-- chunk -->

### it may become rapid, low, feeble, weak, and nonresistant; tongue usually

<!-- chunk -->

### blue, purple, or darkish in some (not usually all) areas; coating (if any)

<!-- chunk -->

### heavy, congealed, yellow, or yellow/brown.

<!-- chunk -->

### The major organs affected by the depressed tissue state are the colon,

<!-- chunk -->

### liver, pancreas, lymphatic/immune system, blood and cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### system. In extreme cases the nervous system is damaged. The large

<!-- chunk -->

### intestine is subject to toxic secretion from unhealthy bacteria. The liver

<!-- chunk -->

### is subject to poisoning from toxins brought to it from the rest of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Excess bacteria and toxins weaken the lymphatic/immune system

<!-- chunk -->

### (which has to break down pathological cell growths). The great scourges

<!-- chunk -->

### of health—cancer, heart disease, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### —are more often found in association with this tissue state. Aberrant

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue growth and cancer are more likely when the immune system is

<!-- chunk -->

### depressed. Eventually, there is blood poisoning, with destruction of the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood and nerves.

<!-- chunk -->

## Damp • Relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

### The term “relaxation” goes all the way back to the Hippocratic writers,

<!-- chunk -->

### who called diarrhea a “relaxed” condition of the bowels. Thus, from the

<!-- chunk -->

### beginning, relaxation was associated with tissue lacking in tone and

<!-- chunk -->

### giving off excessive fluids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Alvah Curtis and Dr. William Cook (1869, 45) associated

<!-- chunk -->

### “relaxation” with the need for astringents. The latter considered white

<!-- chunk -->

### oak bark (Quercus alba) to be the archetypal representative for this

<!-- chunk -->

### category. However, Thurston changed the name to “dilation” and

<!-- chunk -->

### associated it with “congestive chills” caused by swollen tissue deep

<!-- chunk -->

### inside the organism. The nauseant bitters that correlate with the tense or

<!-- chunk -->

### constricted tissue state, however, treat such chills. Thus, I have followed

<!-- chunk -->

### Curtis and Cook.

<!-- chunk -->

### Relaxation describes tissue that is atonic, flaccid, saggy, or collapsed.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to sagging and losing its tone, it does not hold fluids, so there

<!-- chunk -->

### is a continuous loss of fluid, called “free secretion” in the old authors.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tendency to discharge is so strong that running ulcers may form.

<!-- chunk -->

### Discharges of saliva, mucus, urine, sweat, and diarrhea are thin, clear,

<!-- chunk -->

### watery, and copious. The mucus tends to be dilute, clear, or white, while

<!-- chunk -->

### that of stagnation is heavy, thick, yellow, green, or catarrhal. Astringents

<!-- chunk -->

### are called for in such conditions because they coat the membranes with

<!-- chunk -->

### proteins that stop free secretion. They also improve the tone and stop the

<!-- chunk -->

### sagging and prolapse.

<!-- chunk -->

### Flaccid tissue not only loses fluids but minerals. When we are at rest,

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium is moved from the bones to the serum, but when we are active it

<!-- chunk -->

### is moved in the other direction—hence the importance of exercise in the

<!-- chunk -->

### prevention of osteoporosis. Calcium helps magnesium sedate the muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### so it is needed in extra dosage when the muscles are in a relaxed state.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a consequence, the relaxed tissue state is associated with a generally

<!-- chunk -->

### alkaline condition of the blood, fluids, and urine, yet with

<!-- chunk -->

### demineralization, bone loss, and weakness of the bones. The alkalis may

<!-- chunk -->

### deposit out of the fluids, into the tissues, forming bony growths,

<!-- chunk -->

### swellings, arthritis, gouty deposits, indurated and nodulated glands,

<!-- chunk -->

### impediments to hearing, and cataracts. The bone marrow may be

<!-- chunk -->

### weakened, leading to poor production of white cells and red cells, low

<!-- chunk -->

### immunity, poor bone growth, anemia, and developmental problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### Keratin may leak out of the skin, causing hardness and roughness of the

<!-- chunk -->

### palms.

<!-- chunk -->

### One would think that relaxation of the tissues would cause a

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation of the organism in general. However, the imbalances

<!-- chunk -->

### precipitated by fluid loss, including the loss of potassium and the

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulation of excess sodium, cause high blood pressure and

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological tension to occur. Thus, the relaxed tissue state can, though

<!-- chunk -->

### initially relaxed, become exceedingly tense.

<!-- chunk -->

### The relaxed tissue state also includes a condition called “passive

<!-- chunk -->

### venous congestion” by the old doctors. The arteries and veins are

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxed, leading to passive congestion of blood in the more easily dilated

<!-- chunk -->

### veins. There is congestion in the liver, lungs, and right side of the heart.

<!-- chunk -->

### High blood pressure accompanies this condition; there is excess sodium

<!-- chunk -->

### and not enough potassium. The complexion is blue from excess venous

<!-- chunk -->

### blood, or the veins are prominent or swollen. In addition to a tendency

<!-- chunk -->

### to blue complexion, the relaxed tissue state has a tendency to a pale

<!-- chunk -->

### complexion.

<!-- chunk -->

### When relaxation affects the kidneys, there is poor signaling to the

<!-- chunk -->

### bone marrow to produce replacement red blood cells. This results in

<!-- chunk -->

### “kidney anemia,” or what the old doctors called “poor blood.” The blue

<!-- chunk -->

### veins are usually prominent through the pale skin and the skin and

<!-- chunk -->

### mucosa are moister than in iron deficiency anemia. Poor maturation of

<!-- chunk -->

### white blood cells also seems to occur in the bone marrow, so that there

<!-- chunk -->

### are symptoms of what we would today call “low immunity”: recurrent

<!-- chunk -->

### upper respiratory infections, chronic swollen glands, and a tendency to

<!-- chunk -->

### tuberculosis. The “consumptive taint” or tubercular tendency was

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with thin, poorly nourished, pale persons with low calcium

<!-- chunk -->

### levels. Relaxation has low available calcium levels and it is calcium the

<!-- chunk -->

### body uses to wall off the tubercle.

<!-- chunk -->

### The characteristic symptoms of relaxation are pale, cool, and moist

<!-- chunk -->

### skin, with a tendency toward visible, prominent veins. Free secretion of

<!-- chunk -->

### clear, thin mucus, sweat, urine, and diarrhea. Glands, tonsils, and

<!-- chunk -->

### adenoids are swollen, what the old authors often refer to as “relaxed

<!-- chunk -->

### tonsils.” Chronic swollen glands eventually become hard, indurated, and

<!-- chunk -->

### calcified. Calcifications cause cataract and hearing problems, but there

<!-- chunk -->

### are weak, decalcified bones, teeth and tendon weaknesses, poor bone

<!-- chunk -->

### formation, and unhealthy bone marrow. The last causes low white and

<!-- chunk -->

### red cell counts and low immunity. Renal anemia from poor kidney

<!-- chunk -->

### signaling to the marrow. Muscles are at first relaxed, but, due to loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### calcium to assist the magnesium, they can become twitchy. The tongue

<!-- chunk -->

### is moist, often clear, with foamy streamers down the sides. Pulse is

<!-- chunk -->

### languid, nonresistant, or tense from venous obstruction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Damp • Torpor • Stagnation

<!-- chunk -->

### The Greeks recognized two types of dampness. Fluids can actively run

<!-- chunk -->

### out of the body (relaxation), or they can collect inside the tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### (stagnation, torpor). In the second case, when the water is stuck, tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### are swollen, weak, infiltrated with water and ill nourished, since excess

<!-- chunk -->

### water acts as a barrier to nutrition. The water itself is inactive. It collects

<!-- chunk -->

### materials and can thicken and stagnate. The old English herbalists

<!-- chunk -->

### referred to this tissue state as “thickening of the humors.” Fluids thicken

<!-- chunk -->

### to produce humors, catarrh, or canker. Membranes associated with such

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation and catarrh do not secrete or excrete as they should. This

<!-- chunk -->

### causes impeded nutrition, metabolism, and elimination. These thickened

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids are associated with the accumulation of toxins. It is also possible

<!-- chunk -->

### that the reverse is true: weakened nutrition, metabolism, and elimination

<!-- chunk -->

### cause stagnant fluids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Toxins are substances that burden the body because they need further

<!-- chunk -->

### elaboration or breakdown. The accumulation of toxins was called “bad

<!-- chunk -->

### blood,” “impure blood,” “toxic blood” or “toxemia.” The word “bad

<!-- chunk -->

### blood” comes from American Indian practice, while “impure blood”

<!-- chunk -->

### translates a German term. Dr. J. Tilden introduced the term “toxemia” in

<!-- chunk -->

### 1890. The standard remedies for this condition are the “blood purifiers”

<!-- chunk -->

### or alteratives.

<!-- chunk -->

### Medical theories about “bad blood” have changed and evolved over

<!-- chunk -->

### the centuries. In the early nineteenth century, it was recognized that

<!-- chunk -->

### scurvy was one source of the condition, and remedies for humors were

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes called antiscorbutics. In the middle of the nineteenth century,

<!-- chunk -->

### “bad blood” was associated with incomplete nutrition, metabolism, and

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination. Scudder (1874, 313) associated “bad blood” with lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion and excretion. Thurston (1900, 270) concluded that torpor (or

<!-- chunk -->

### “atonicity” as he called it), was due to lack of secretion and excretion. In

<!-- chunk -->

### the twentieth century, the condition is sometimes called “toxic liver”

<!-- chunk -->

### since the liver is the center for non-cellular detoxification or catabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Broda Barnes (1976, 101) noted that the symptoms associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### “bad blood” are identical to those caused by low metabolism from

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroidism. The poor peripheral circulation and oxidation

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with this endocrine imbalance cause the skin lesions so

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic of “bad blood.” They also cause thickening of the fluids

<!-- chunk -->

### with stagnant water mixed with a mucoid substance. The question is,

<!-- chunk -->

### though, which came first, the toxins encumbering the metabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### causing hypothyroidism, or low thyroxine causing low metabolism.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the key to treating “bad blood.” Most of the blood purifiers or

<!-- chunk -->

### alteratives are bitters that increase secretion in the digestive tract, liver,

<!-- chunk -->

### and eliminative channels. This promotes tissue activity and nutrition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Excretion from the colon is also improved. Most of the old laxatives and

<!-- chunk -->

### cathartics are also bitter alteratives. Several thyroid active remedies are

<!-- chunk -->

### included among the old list of alteratives (kelp, bladderwrack, black

<!-- chunk -->

### walnut, iris, poke root), showing that the old doctors made this

<!-- chunk -->

### connection intuitively.

<!-- chunk -->

### Characteristic symptoms of stagnation or torpor include swollen,

<!-- chunk -->

### flabby, apathetic, weak tissues. The tissues show a “want of expression”

<!-- chunk -->

### as Scudder remarks. This extends to the face. “The patient is dull and

<!-- chunk -->

### apathetic, the eye dull, the face expressionless, the tongue somewhat

<!-- chunk -->

### full, and the pulse lacks sharpness in the wave—oppressed” (Scudder,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1874, 303, 314). Lack of expression is one of the most characteristic

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of hypothyroidism. The leading symptom of bad blood is a

<!-- chunk -->

### tendency to hangover conditions and feelings, because the liver and

<!-- chunk -->

### lymph system cannot handle heavy or toxic foods and excesses of

<!-- chunk -->

### various kinds, including exercise. A leading symptom of hypothyroidism

<!-- chunk -->

### is fatigue. With low metabolism, water builds up and thickens. There are

<!-- chunk -->

### often swollen lymphatics with low immunity or resistance to disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Heavy, thick, adhesive mucus forms and clings to surfaces. Peripheral

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation is weak, with poor oxidation, leading to skin lesions and poor

<!-- chunk -->

### wound healing. Arthritic or rheumatic pains are common. The tongue is

<!-- chunk -->

### usually flabby, apathetic, or atonic with a thick, turbid, and adhesive

<!-- chunk -->

### coating.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most people will have a hard time differentiating the six tissue states

<!-- chunk -->

### at the start. The student can only understand one or two tissue states at

<!-- chunk -->

### first, incorporate that into practice, and then expand on this foundation,

<!-- chunk -->

### as experience deepens. The experienced clinician, on the other hand, will

<!-- chunk -->

### have trouble limiting tissue states to six. He or she will be able to

<!-- chunk -->

### imagine all sorts of tissue changes that could be given their own class.

<!-- chunk -->

### In practice, most people will exhibit a mix of tissue states—usually

<!-- chunk -->

### two, and sometimes three. Diseases often go through a progression of

<!-- chunk -->

### states. Opposites are often active: irritation/depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### constriction/relaxation, and atrophy/stagnation. In chronic cases, the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism seems to reduce to the least active: atrophy, torpor, and

<!-- chunk -->

### depression.

### The six tissue states comprise a model that is compatible both with

<!-- chunk -->

### modern science and traditional energetic medicine. It is related to the

<!-- chunk -->

### way that modern Western people think about their psychological and

<!-- chunk -->

### physical sensations and conditions. It thus forms a bridge between the

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional and the modern, the practitioner and the patient. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### important of all, it is an eminently practical method for understanding

<!-- chunk -->

### and treating illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Whenever we apply a system to nature we must be aware that there

<!-- chunk -->

### will be exceptions and anomalies. The rule works beautifully most of the

<!-- chunk -->

### time, but we should not expect it to work all the time. Thus, one of our

### best cooling sedatives, yarrow, is a stimulant!

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue States and Medicinal Actions

<!-- chunk -->

### In traditional Western medicine the actions of medicinal plants are

<!-- chunk -->

### described according to three basic classes: physiological imbalance

<!-- chunk -->

### (tissue state), physiological function, and organ-affinity. The first

<!-- chunk -->

### category includes astringents, stimulants, sedatives, antispasmodics, and

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatics. The second includes diaphoretics, antifebriles, diuretics,

<!-- chunk -->

### emmenagogues, and anodynes. The third includes stomachics,

<!-- chunk -->

### nephretics, nervines, and pectorals.

<!-- chunk -->

### The relationship between tissue states and medicinal properties is

<!-- chunk -->

### fairly exact. In fact, we can speak of specific tastes and temperatures as

<!-- chunk -->

### relating to specific tissue states. In fact, there is a tradition linking

<!-- chunk -->

### elements, humors, or tissue states with specific tastes in quite a few

<!-- chunk -->

### traditions. The following table represents the basic therapeutic

<!-- chunk -->

### correlations used in this book. It is not based on a metaphysical premise,

<!-- chunk -->

### but on physiological patterns. However, it can be correlated with the

<!-- chunk -->

### older systems, as well as with modern pharmacognosy.

<!-- chunk -->

### In developing the preceding table I have been much influenced by the

<!-- chunk -->

### pioneering work of David Winston, registered herbalist (AHG). He has

<!-- chunk -->

### worked out a good system of correlations between traditional systems of

<!-- chunk -->

### energetics and the new science of pharmacognosy, or plant chemistry. I

<!-- chunk -->

### have not brought the present system up to the modern level, but

<!-- chunk -->

### retained the old nomenclature, which is based on a less refined organic

<!-- chunk -->

### chemistry, but which is just as accurate and also in line with a generally

<!-- chunk -->

### energetic view.

<!-- chunk -->

### When herbs are used in an overly intense, concentrated form they can

<!-- chunk -->

### engender reactions opposite to the above. Acidity (sour) turns down

<!-- chunk -->

### oxidation (heat) in the cells, but in large amounts it causes oxidation or

<!-- chunk -->

### burning. Acridity relaxes, but in large doses it agitates (valerian).

<!-- chunk -->

### Astringents are contracting, but large doses can bind so thoroughly that

<!-- chunk -->

### they cause dryness and tension. Sweets nourish and sedate in

<!-- chunk -->

### moderation, but prolonged overuse causes the cells to reject insulin and

<!-- chunk -->

### blood sugar, resulting in a depressed tissue state, i.e., type II diabetes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most plants act on a combination of two or three states. Thus, rose

<!-- chunk -->

### (sour astringent) is suited to irritation with relaxation, or hot conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### with uncontrollable discharges. It was a traditional remedy for

<!-- chunk -->

### tuberculosis. A good indication nowadays is a red/pink tongue with

<!-- chunk -->

### moist streamers down the sides. Peach, a cousin of the rose, is sour,

<!-- chunk -->

### bitter, and mucilaginous, so it is suited to conditions where there is heat

<!-- chunk -->

### with some dryness. Here the tongue is red/pink and dry. Another cousin,

<!-- chunk -->

### almond, is highly oily, so it is suited to dry/atrophic conditions with

<!-- chunk -->

### some irritation. Marshmallow (salty, moist, cool) will almost always act

<!-- chunk -->

### where dryness is combined with irritation. Tongue red, dry, cracked.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because it is salty it is further indicated where there is hardened tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fenugreek (moist, oily, salty, pungent, warm) will act where dryness

<!-- chunk -->

### combines with cold. White pine (aromatic, oily) will act where there is

<!-- chunk -->

### depression with atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

### s we have seen, the medicinal substance itself can be looked

<!-- chunk -->

### upon as an energetic entity. Herbs can be used for either material

<!-- chunk -->

### or energetic purposes, to suppress or cure. In order to use them

<!-- chunk -->

### holistically, we need to use them energetically, that is to say, according

<!-- chunk -->

### to the impression they make upon the life force of the whole organism,

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than the purely physical body. In other words, the energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### configuration of the disease must be related to the energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### configuration of the medicine. Down through the centuries, various

<!-- chunk -->

### principles have been applied to match remedy and sickness from this

<!-- chunk -->

### standpoint.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is an art and a science to using the medicinal substance in a

<!-- chunk -->

### holistic fashion. That is the subject of this chapter. In this book we will

<!-- chunk -->

### only consider the single remedy rather than the formula. The latter also

<!-- chunk -->

### is subject to energetic laws, but the subject is too complex for our

<!-- chunk -->

### immediate discussion. My good friend, the late William LeSassier,

<!-- chunk -->

### utilized an energetic system of herbal compounding that came to him in

<!-- chunk -->

### a vision. William once said to a small class, “all of us could take nettles

<!-- chunk -->

### and we’d all react in different ways, but once I stick nettles in a formula

<!-- chunk -->

### I know exactly what it does.” There is an art to using the single

<!-- chunk -->

### substance and the compound.

<!-- chunk -->

## Simpling

<!-- chunk -->

### When an herb is used by itself to heal it is called a simple. When several

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs are combined together they are called a compound. Simpling is a

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic of the folk tradition while compounding was associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with the scholastic tradition of Galenic medicine and educated doctors.

<!-- chunk -->

### Compounds were, in fact, sometimes called Galenicals. The use of

<!-- chunk -->

### simples or single remedies was an important aspect of Samuel

<!-- chunk -->

### Hahnemann’s homeopathy. Dr. John M. Scudder (1827–93), the great

<!-- chunk -->

### eclectic physician, introduced it in botanical medicine in the nineteenth

<!-- chunk -->

### century. He termed it “specific medicine.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Galen (c.

C.E

<!-- chunk -->

### .) was the founder of the rational doctrine in

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. He taught the old Aristotelian idea that the properties of a

<!-- chunk -->

### plant were found in its qualities (hot, cold, damp, dry). If a condition

<!-- chunk -->

### was hot and dry, one combined cold and damp medicines to match the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem. Galenic doctors tended to use compounds established by

<!-- chunk -->

### professional tradition rather than single herbs known from experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### The simpler, by comparison, tended to view the plant as possessing

<!-- chunk -->

### unique virtues suited to a specific problem. He or she was usually looked

<!-- chunk -->

### down upon as an unsophisticated enthusiastic. There was little respect

<!-- chunk -->

### for the value of hands-on experience then (as now). Experience was

<!-- chunk -->

### considered to be inferior to rational doctrine, just as today experiential

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine is dismissed as “anecdotal.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Galen divided medicine into three schools: rational, methodist, and

<!-- chunk -->

### empirical. The first practiced according to a rational system, the second

<!-- chunk -->

### according to a single rational idea (“everyone needs to be purged”), and

<!-- chunk -->

### the third according to empiricism, or personal experience. The simpler

<!-- chunk -->

### or “empiric” was placed in the last category. Samuel Thomson was

<!-- chunk -->

### derided as a “botanic empiric.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Experience was the guiding light of empirical medicine, but to the

<!-- chunk -->

### extent that there was any system in traditional folk practice it was often

<!-- chunk -->

### based on the law of similars (“like treats like”) and the “doctrine of

<!-- chunk -->

### signatures.” The basic idea here is that if a plant resembles a disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### organ, or person it will help cure. Chelidonium, with its yellow sap, was

<!-- chunk -->

### considered a specific for the bile. Chelidonium was official in the U.S.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pharmacopoeia until after 1950 for hepatic disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes specifics were learned from observation of animal uses of

<!-- chunk -->

### plants. There was an old European peasant tradition that Chelidonium

<!-- chunk -->

### was used by swallows to treat the eyes of young chicks when they were

<!-- chunk -->

### stuck together. It was therefore adopted into peasant medicine as a

<!-- chunk -->

### specific for the eyes. Herbalist Maurice Messegue was taken by his

<!-- chunk -->

### father, a peasant herbalist in Gascony in the early twentieth century, to

<!-- chunk -->

### observe swallows rubbing celandine on the eyes of their young.

<!-- chunk -->

### Empirical medicine is largely uncharted territory, but it fascinated a

<!-- chunk -->

### certain number of off beat scholars down through the centuries. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### consequence, a number of simples, formulas, and recipes for specific uses

<!-- chunk -->

### were gathered and recorded. This resulted in the generation of a type of

<!-- chunk -->

### literature called the “books of secrets.” These tomes often consisted of

<!-- chunk -->

### long lists of simples and recipes for all sorts of industrial, medical, and

<!-- chunk -->

### occult purposes. They were often attributing to famous “scientists.” For

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, Albertus Magnus did not actually write the famous Book of

<!-- chunk -->

### Secrets of Albertus Magnus. Often the information was garbled or

<!-- chunk -->

### incredible, but the doctrine of specific knowledge was perpetuated as an

<!-- chunk -->

### ideal. With the advent of the printing press this knowledge was edited,

<!-- chunk -->

### sorted, and published. It proved to be a great stimulus, both in industry

<!-- chunk -->

### and medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The word “secret” (arcana) was used in this literature for a number of

<!-- chunk -->

### reasons. It was thought that simples were known to animals and

<!-- chunk -->

### untutored rustics untainted by conventional science. It was felt that

<!-- chunk -->

### animals and people of Nature had a more direct insight into the

<!-- chunk -->

### workings of Nature. This information was secret in the sense that it lay

<!-- chunk -->

### outside the established tradition. In other cases it was secret because the

<!-- chunk -->

### directions were known only to some family, guild, or individual. We still

<!-- chunk -->

### do not know, for instance, how to make many of the colors known to the

<!-- chunk -->

### medieval glaziers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Paracelsus (1493–1541) was the first widely known physician who

<!-- chunk -->

### turned against rational medicine and embraced the empirical tradition.

<!-- chunk -->

### He was the first to work out an articulate medical system opposed to

<!-- chunk -->

### Galen. For Paracelsus, the basis of empiricism was the experience that

<!-- chunk -->

### Nature is alive and intelligent. Since this knowledge is subjective, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### hidden. Thus, the individual mineral, plant, or disease has an innate

<!-- chunk -->

### arcanum, intelligence, virtue, power, or energy. This inner arcana is

<!-- chunk -->

### outwardly reflected in its “signatures” or physical expression and

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents. The medicine contains the correct expression of healthy

<!-- chunk -->

### energy blocked in the disease. It communicates this virtue, power, or

<!-- chunk -->

### essence and returns the sick person to health. Treatment is thus by

<!-- chunk -->

### similars or signatures.

<!-- chunk -->

### Paracelsus represented a long line of thinkers who valued the internal

<!-- chunk -->

### or archetypal nature of the substance. This way of thinking traces back

<!-- chunk -->

### to Plato, the early Alexandrian philosophers who have come down to us

<!-- chunk -->

### under the name Hermes Trismegistos, the subsequent Hermetic tradition,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the Neo-Platonists, moving forward in time to Jacob Boehme,

<!-- chunk -->

### Emmanuel Swedenborg, J. W. Goethe, and Rudolf Steiner. During the

<!-- chunk -->

### Renaissance, the Paracelsian impulse was keenly felt and contributed

<!-- chunk -->

### much to the development of early chemistry, surgery, and medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ultimately, however, this way of thinking, along with the folk medical

<!-- chunk -->

### empiricism upon which it drew, was expurgated by emerging science.

<!-- chunk -->

### Paracelsus used the term specific to indicate a single substance (or

<!-- chunk -->

### compound) with a definite relationship to a specific set of symptoms,

<!-- chunk -->

### condition, part, or process in the body. From this time forward, the

<!-- chunk -->

### alchemical physicians increasingly favored this term over the older term

<!-- chunk -->

### simple.

<!-- chunk -->

### After a period of conflict, the Galenic and Paracelsian approaches

<!-- chunk -->

### continued to be used along side each other. William Salmon, the last of

<!-- chunk -->

### the great Renaissance herbal physicians, included both the qualities and

<!-- chunk -->

### a “specification” for almost every plant in his English Herbal. For

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, under arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) he writes (1709, 42):

<!-- chunk -->

### The Qualities. They are cold in the first degree, and temperate in

<!-- chunk -->

### respect to dryness or moisture. They are also alteratives, astringents,

<!-- chunk -->

### abstersives, incarnatives, glutinatives, and traumaticks or vulneraries;

<!-- chunk -->

### and appropriated to the spleen, reins, and joynts.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Specification. I have had great experience of the virtues and

<!-- chunk -->

### use of this herb, and have found it to be a peculiar wound herb,

<!-- chunk -->

### whether inwardly taken or outwardly apply’d; besides its signature

<!-- chunk -->

### bespeaks the very same thing.

<!-- chunk -->

### The first paragraph makes reference to the three classes used to

<!-- chunk -->

### designate the properties of herbs in Galenic medicines: qualities (hot or

<!-- chunk -->

### cold), appropriations (organ affinities), and actions (glutinative). The

<!-- chunk -->

### second paragraph refers to both experience and the doctrine of

<!-- chunk -->

### signatures—arrowhead looks like a wound-inflicting instrument. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### introduction to his Herbal, Salmon notes that the specifications were

<!-- chunk -->

### largely known either by experience or signature. This reflects empirical

<!-- chunk -->

### folk tradition and Paracelsian teaching.

<!-- chunk -->

## Specific Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### Specificity continued to exert an influence after the passage of the

<!-- chunk -->

### Renaissance. Samuel Hahnemann originally called his homeopathic

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies specifics. However, as a careful student of language, he later

<!-- chunk -->

### defined them more correctly as similars. This is because they are

<!-- chunk -->

### administered on the basis of the law of similars, and not on the basis of

<!-- chunk -->

### specificity. As many homeopaths can testify from experience,

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathic remedies are often specific when applied according to the

<!-- chunk -->

### law of similars, but this is not their distinguishing characteristic.

<!-- chunk -->

### These philological fine points left the term specific open for use by Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### John Milton Scudder. He developed a system of therapy based entirely

<!-- chunk -->

### the use of specifics. In practice, many of these specifics were used

<!-- chunk -->

### several at a time, or in formulations mixed for a specific situation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder also included room for the use of well-established compounds

<!-- chunk -->

### alongside specifics.

<!-- chunk -->

### For Scudder, the specific was a medicine that could be reliably used

<!-- chunk -->

### for a certain condition, not because it was specific to an accepted

<!-- chunk -->

### pathological concept or disease name, but because it was suited to an

<!-- chunk -->

### exact energetic imbalance, or what he called a “wrong of life.” The

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge of specifics was gained from the experience of what worked,

<!-- chunk -->

### and not merely theory. His work was, therefore, very much a

<!-- chunk -->

### continuation of the tradition of simpling and empiricism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder’s work not only reflected European tradition, but also the

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge of specific medicines picked up from Native American

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. Specifics more readily crossed the language barrier than

<!-- chunk -->

### formulations. One frontier doctor, Peter Smith (1812) testifies, “I call

<!-- chunk -->

### myself an Indian Doctor, because I have incidentally obtained a

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge of many of the simples used by the Indians; but chiefly

<!-- chunk -->

### because I have obtained my knowledge generally in the like manner that

<!-- chunk -->

### the Indians do …,” i.e., by experience rather than book knowledge.

<!-- chunk -->

### In contrast to the simplers and homeopaths, Scudder worked out a

<!-- chunk -->

### doctrine of medicine by which specifics were applied to particular

<!-- chunk -->

### “wrongs of life” or energetic imbalances. He called this system “specific

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine.” In a sense, he organized the empirical method, based as it

<!-- chunk -->

### was upon raw experience, into a system of medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### For Scudder, life is sensed by the life of the observer. Scudder taught

<!-- chunk -->

### his students to look at the complexion, tongue, pulse, and most obvious

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. These would communicate the “wrong of life.” He taught that

<!-- chunk -->

### the vital force of the physician would sense the wrong in the vital force

<!-- chunk -->

### of the sick person. Life communicates to life.

<!-- chunk -->

### In order to describe “wrongs of life,” Scudder (1874, 55–67) utilized

<!-- chunk -->

### the simple medical terms expressing the appearance of disease, such as:

<!-- chunk -->

### excitation, contraction, enfeeblement, depression, want of expression,

<!-- chunk -->

### determination of blood, congestion, hyperemia, inflammation, effusion,

<!-- chunk -->

### atrophic irritation, activity, want of activity, irritation. This is a

<!-- chunk -->

### sampling only from a dozen pages of one of his writings. Most of these

<!-- chunk -->

### are medical terms known to all nineteenth-century physicians. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### they were not used as the basis of prescription, but to describe aspects of

<!-- chunk -->

### disease. Scudder made these the categories by which disease and remedy

<!-- chunk -->

### were classified.

<!-- chunk -->

### For Scudder, that which lives senses life. Like Hippocrates, he taught

<!-- chunk -->

### that the study of medicine begins by training the senses to experience

<!-- chunk -->

### life. The human senses are the foundation of medicinal knowledge and

<!-- chunk -->

### they are trained by exposure to life in all its forms. “The education that

<!-- chunk -->

### gives the best results, and makes the successful practitioner, is of the

<!-- chunk -->

### senses, and of the brain to receive impressions, and make deductions.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet, this is ignored in medical education (1874, 12): “Men live a

<!-- chunk -->

### lifetime, and know nothing of the manifestations of life. Students

<!-- chunk -->

### become conversant with books, attend their lectures, pass their

<!-- chunk -->

### examinations, and yet have no practical knowledge of human life. And

<!-- chunk -->

### physicians will practice medicine a lifetime, and yet fail to know what

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy life is.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The intelligence and vital force of the medical aspirant can be trained

<!-- chunk -->

### to this deeper perception, says Scudder. Unfortunately, he also says,

<!-- chunk -->

### “men dislike work.” It is easier to study books and “objective facts” than

<!-- chunk -->

### to develop one’s subjective life, senses, perceptive abilities, and method

<!-- chunk -->

### of thinking. Modern medical education is predicated on the idea that

<!-- chunk -->

### subjective life is innately unreliable and untrustworthy. There is

<!-- chunk -->

### something wrong with the inner life of the medical student that cannot

<!-- chunk -->

### be trusted. Only objective facts can be trusted. Likewise, Nature herself

<!-- chunk -->

### is untrustworthy. She cannot repair herself. She is broken; the physician

<!-- chunk -->

### must fix her.

<!-- chunk -->

### In contrast, vitalism looks upon the body as a living being which can

<!-- chunk -->

### correct and cure itself. The physician, as a living being, is in touch with

<!-- chunk -->

### his or her own life force and can sense what is wrong. Nature has

<!-- chunk -->

### unlimited intelligence based on the survival of all living species down

<!-- chunk -->

### through the ages, even extinct species, for that matter.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder taught the use of the pulse, tongue, complexion, and salient

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms as the principal methods for uncovering these “wrongs of

<!-- chunk -->

### life.” The pulse does not just represent the condition of the circulation,

<!-- chunk -->

### but of the nervous system, blood, and tissues as a whole. The tongue

<!-- chunk -->

### shows a graphic picture of the mucous membranes, as well as tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition, innervation, blood, and fluids. The complexion and expression

<!-- chunk -->

### indicate the condition of the entire organism, and the psychological

<!-- chunk -->

### state. By careful observation, the physician sees the “wrong of life”

<!-- chunk -->

### shining through, from its core into its peripheral expressions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Three Primal Therapeutic Laws

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder was a pragmatist. He was not interested in laws of therapy. If a

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy was found through experience to work for a certain condition or

<!-- chunk -->

### symptom, that was all he needed to know. However, we can find such

<!-- chunk -->

### universal laws in the behavior of medicinal substances. These help us to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the way medicinal substances work in an energetic fashion.

<!-- chunk -->

### In homeopathy the “universal law of healing” is the “law of similars,”

<!-- chunk -->

### or “like treats like.” This is based on the fact that the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### produced by a substance acting in excess upon the organism (as a

<!-- chunk -->

### poison) are the symptoms that it will cure when these appear in the sick

<!-- chunk -->

### person in the course of disease. In order to eliminate side effects, the

<!-- chunk -->

### dose is diluted. In Galenic medicine, on the other hand, the guiding light

<!-- chunk -->

### of therapy is the “law of contraries,” or “hot to cold.” If a person is

<!-- chunk -->

### chilled, he or she is given warm wine or herb teas to reestablish

<!-- chunk -->

### peripheral warmth and circulation. We can already observe that this law

<!-- chunk -->

### governs most of the remedies used to cure according to the tissue state

<!-- chunk -->

### model.

<!-- chunk -->

### How are we too make sense out of these conflicting “laws?” Some

<!-- chunk -->

### herbs work according to several approaches. Chelidonium (celandine) is

<!-- chunk -->

### bitter and heating. Used according to the law of contraries, it will warm

<!-- chunk -->

### up and dissipate congestion, and that is what it does in the liver and gall

<!-- chunk -->

### bladder. However, the location of its work is only specified through the

<!-- chunk -->

### doctrine of signatures: it is useful for problems with the bile because it

<!-- chunk -->

### has a unique yellow, bile-like sap. It has received a homeopathic proving

<!-- chunk -->

### (celandine is fairly toxic), producing symptoms of congestion in the liver

<!-- chunk -->

### and gall bladder so it works on the same basic conditions whether it is

<!-- chunk -->

### used as a contrary (hot to cold), a similar or by signature.

<!-- chunk -->

### In my first book, Seven Herbs: Plants as Teachers (1987) I proposed that

<!-- chunk -->

### there were three primary laws of healing: the law of similars, the law of

<!-- chunk -->

### direction of cure, and the law of the healing crisis. Since that time I have

<!-- chunk -->

### come to see that the law of contraries, the law of similars, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### doctrine of signatures are all valid and in fact derived from another,

<!-- chunk -->

### more unifying law. As a consequence, I have folded them together under

<!-- chunk -->

### one heading: the law of action and reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Law of Action and Reaction

<!-- chunk -->

### The living organism responds to stress by taking countermeasures. When

<!-- chunk -->

### the cell gets cold, it contracts or shrinks to save energy. When it returns

<!-- chunk -->

### to health, it expands to take in potential energy. What our body feels is

<!-- chunk -->

### stiffening and shivering followed by fever. If, on the other hand, the cell

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes overheated, it expands to give off heat. As it contracts back to

<!-- chunk -->

### normal size, it gives off water. What we feel is a fever followed by sweat,

<!-- chunk -->

### urination, purging, or expectoration.

<!-- chunk -->

### The self-healing mechanism of the organism counteracts

<!-- chunk -->

### environmental stress. It takes an action in one direction and then a

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction in the opposite direction to contend with stress and return to

<!-- chunk -->

### the healthy mean or homeostasis. Dr. Harold Lindlahr, the “philosopher

<!-- chunk -->

### of naturopathy,” named this the “law of action and reaction.” It is also

<!-- chunk -->

### known as the Arndt/Schulz law in European phytotherapy: for every

<!-- chunk -->

### biological reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

### As long as the organism is able to act and react it will be able to

<!-- chunk -->

### recover from disease. Problems arise when it gets stuck in either

<!-- chunk -->

### polarity. Too strong an emphasis in one direction will soon make it

<!-- chunk -->

### difficult to move in the opposite direction. Action and reaction generates

<!-- chunk -->

### the six tissue states. Basic energetic imbalances in the body represent

<!-- chunk -->

### simple excesses in opposite directions: excitation/depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### constriction/relaxation, atrophy/torpor.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the organism becomes stuck in one of these conditions, the

<!-- chunk -->

### conventional biomedical response is to suppress the condition. For

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, aspirin or some other drug is given to suppress the febrile

<!-- chunk -->

### reaction. With more complicated diseases, more complex pathways are

<!-- chunk -->

### forced into action or inaction to suppress symptoms. This causes the

<!-- chunk -->

### original imbalance to be replaced by a drug-induced imbalance,

<!-- chunk -->

### ultimately causing a new, iatrogenic (drug-caused) disease. In a

<!-- chunk -->

### completely unconscious and unobservant practice, these symptoms are

<!-- chunk -->

### then suppressed by a new drug and so on, until the patient dies of

<!-- chunk -->

### “natural causes.”

<!-- chunk -->

### In holistic medicine, on the other hand, we want to return the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism back to the original condition where it was able to maintain

<!-- chunk -->

### and cure itself. We believe in the self-curative ability of Nature and its

<!-- chunk -->

### little microcosm, the organism. We want to work with, and restore,

<!-- chunk -->

### Nature. Our approach, therefore, is the opposite of the modern

<!-- chunk -->

### biomedical method.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most obvious action we can take is to counteract the initial

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance. If the organism is too cold we can warm it up, starting with

<!-- chunk -->

### warm food, clothing, and proper environment. We can go further and

<!-- chunk -->

### use warming herbs (ginger, cayenne, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and

<!-- chunk -->

### others).

<!-- chunk -->

### At this point, the controversy between contraries and similars rears its

<!-- chunk -->

### ugly head. In treating the cold condition with hot herbs are we not

<!-- chunk -->

### suppressing symptoms? That would be the homeopathic position.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lindlahr pointed out the solution to this problem (Lindlahr, 1917, 59).

<!-- chunk -->

### When a poison acts on the organism it causes an initial or primary

<!-- chunk -->

### action, which represents the destructive effects on the body. Then the

<!-- chunk -->

### body responds to remove the symptoms. This is the secondary reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

### The primary action of poisons is thus destructive, the secondary action is

<!-- chunk -->

### curative. Thus, in homeopathy, poisons are diluted and succussed

<!-- chunk -->

### (shaken) to eliminate the primary, poisonous action.

<!-- chunk -->

### Foods, herbs, and natural substances like hot and cold water work the

<!-- chunk -->

### opposite way. They cure in their primary action. If the body is weak,

<!-- chunk -->

### foods nourish. If cold, warming herbs or hot water warms. Only if herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### or methods are used too often or for too long do they cause toxic side

<!-- chunk -->

### effects. No one dies from a spoonful of sugar, but they can die from a

<!-- chunk -->

### lifetime of over-consumption of refined carbohydrates. The secondary

<!-- chunk -->

### action of foods is toxic. Thus, foods and poisons act in opposite fashions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Non-toxic herbs generally act like foods. That is to say, they cure by

<!-- chunk -->

### contrary or hot to cold in their primary exposure to the body. In addition

<!-- chunk -->

### to nourishing, they warm or cool, relax or constrict, cleanse or lubricate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taken too much or too long, they overly warm, cool, or relax in their

### secondary action. Thus, non-toxic herbs produce symptoms in their

<!-- chunk -->

### secondary action. The body reacts against this with a third curative

<!-- chunk -->

### phase.

## PoisonsDestructiveCurative

<!-- chunk -->

### When a substance cures by hot to cold, the relationship is called the

<!-- chunk -->

### “law of contraries.” Like to like is called the “law of similars.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Homeopathic remedies work by the law of similars because they are

<!-- chunk -->

### largely poisons that cure what they cause. Herbs, on the other hand,

<!-- chunk -->

### work by both laws. They treat “hot to cold” in their primary phase, they

<!-- chunk -->

### poison in their secondary phase, and they treat as “like to like” in the

<!-- chunk -->

### third phase.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are two different foundations for the law of similars: signatures

<!-- chunk -->

### and pathogenesis. The doctrine of signatures has been much maligned,

<!-- chunk -->

### but it proves to be a useful law of cure itself. The shape, color, or habit

<!-- chunk -->

### of a plant represents the stress that has molded its existence and these

<!-- chunk -->

### contours are related to the same stress acting on a human being and

<!-- chunk -->

### causing disease. Rudolf Steiner argued that the same power that causes

<!-- chunk -->

### “distortions” in plants is the power that causes diseases in human beings.

<!-- chunk -->

### Where the plant responds by changing form, the human being gets sick,

<!-- chunk -->

### rallies, learns physical and spiritual lessons, and continues to grow as a

<!-- chunk -->

### human being. The “distortion” provides the mark or signature

<!-- chunk -->

### corresponding to the disease process in humanity (William Pelikan,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1997, 13–14).

<!-- chunk -->

### Food plants swell up with carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. We see

<!-- chunk -->

### this in the swollen seed of wheat, the tuber of potato, the stem of

<!-- chunk -->

### kohlrabi, and the flower of cauliflower. Medicinal plants, on the other

<!-- chunk -->

### hand, are swollen, angled, enlarged, or reduced in size by natural

<!-- chunk -->

### stresses exerted by the environment. Yarrow is cut back to the vein and

<!-- chunk -->

### rib in order to contend with dramatic changes in cold and heat. Poplar is

<!-- chunk -->

### softened and moistened to take up water. Oak is hardened and dried to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide structure. Pulsatilla is furred to retain warmth in the cold of

<!-- chunk -->

### spring. These “swellings” are the marks or signatures on the plants,

<!-- chunk -->

### indicating the stresses they have overcome for themselves and the

<!-- chunk -->

### stresses they can help us endure. By the “doctrine of signatures,” the

<!-- chunk -->

### plant looks like what it is for—generally like the organ or the disease.

<!-- chunk -->

### The homeopathic principle of similarity has a different basis. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### founded upon pathogenesis, or the principle that the remedy cures the

<!-- chunk -->

### same symptoms that it causes. In order to develop the homeopathic

<!-- chunk -->

### materia medica, Samuel Hahnemann first collected symptoms from

<!-- chunk -->

### poisonings. Later he “proved” the medicinal substances, giving them to a

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy person in a small dose, until they produced symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is no reason why we should have trouble discriminating

<!-- chunk -->

### between cure and suppression if we understand these simple

<!-- chunk -->

### observations or laws. It is only when we use strong, powerful substances

<!-- chunk -->

### to suppress the organism, or to artificially over-stimulate or sedate it,

<!-- chunk -->

### against its normal inclination, that we will be practicing in a manner

<!-- chunk -->

### which is suppressive rather than curative. Likewise, if we use energetic

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies according to a lack of understanding of the energetic behavior

<!-- chunk -->

### of the organism, as is so often the case in modern homeopathy, we will

<!-- chunk -->

### lack a true comprehension of illness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs can be used in an artificial, suppressive manner. For instance,

<!-- chunk -->

### the killing of bacteria by berberine (found in barberry, Oregon grape,

<!-- chunk -->

### and goldenseal) is an artificial imposition. Bacteria are secondary

<!-- chunk -->

### scavengers, usually following upon a derangement in the tissue state.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the excess in hot or cold, damp or dry, constriction or relaxation is

<!-- chunk -->

### removed, the environment off which the bacteria feeds will be removed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another method uses echinacea to enhance the body’s own method—

<!-- chunk -->

### white cell production—to kill bacteria. Does the practitioner know that

<!-- chunk -->

### the body really needs increased white cell production? Or is this just a

<!-- chunk -->

### convenient idea, one little fact torn out of the overall context of Nature,

<!-- chunk -->

### which the practitioner, having no idea how the organism really works,

<!-- chunk -->

### or what it really needs, applies according to his or her status as an

<!-- chunk -->

### outsider, a bumbler, an invader? These forcefully induced activities may

<!-- chunk -->

### temporarily, or perhaps permanently, remove acute conditions, but

<!-- chunk -->

### unless they are working with the body, stimulating or sedating it to its

<!-- chunk -->

### own needs, they are imposing an artificial condition which is never

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy. Killing bacteria is often unnatural and detrimental.

<!-- chunk -->

### The important point from the perspective of vitalism is that every herb

<!-- chunk -->

### and poison ultimately has a primal essence or identity pattern and this,

<!-- chunk -->

### whether delivered in a gentle or a toxic envelope, possesses curative

<!-- chunk -->

### power. The essence shines forth through the chemistry, qualities,

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity, and signatures to show how the agent is to be used

<!-- chunk -->

### appropriately. It teaches the sick, disabled body how to rule supreme in

<!-- chunk -->

### its own environment, to add or expel, dry or lubricate, cool or warm, to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain natural balance or homeostasis.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Law of Direction of Cure

<!-- chunk -->

### This principle was originally named and described by Constantine

<!-- chunk -->

### Hering, one of the chief students of Samuel Hahnemann. Therefore it is

<!-- chunk -->

### also called “Hering’s Law.” Hering observed that when the organism was

<!-- chunk -->

### healing itself, symptoms moved from the more vital to the less vital

<!-- chunk -->

### organs. They also moved from the top downwards (which is, in another

<!-- chunk -->

### sense, from vital to less vital), and from inside to outside. One of

<!-- chunk -->

### Hering’s successors, Dr. James Tyler Kent, called this “government from

<!-- chunk -->

### center to circumference.” We can easily see that the hypothalamus, as

<!-- chunk -->

### regulator of the balance between interior and exterior, follows this law.

<!-- chunk -->

### In fact, all vital activities in the organism conform to this principle.

<!-- chunk -->

### In disease, the organism protects the more vital organs, producing

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms towards the exterior and channels of elimination. In health it

<!-- chunk -->

### also acts in this direction as the disease is driven out. Only as the disease

<!-- chunk -->

### deepens do symptoms and locations become more vital and deeper. This

<!-- chunk -->

### law can therefore be used to monitor healing and disease. It also teaches

<!-- chunk -->

### that, as the organism gets better, the symptoms leave in a reverse order

<!-- chunk -->

### to that in which they arrived.

<!-- chunk -->

### The law of direction of cure was picked up by Dr. Lindlahr and

<!-- chunk -->

### recognized by some naturopaths and nature healers. It was known to Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### Christopher and is sometimes mentioned in herbal literature. Dr. Jensen

<!-- chunk -->

### (1979, 31–33) called it the “reversal process.” Eva Graf and Lalitha

<!-- chunk -->

### Thomas, herbalists influenced by these writers, also use this phrase.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Law of the Healing Crisis

<!-- chunk -->

### When the correct remedy has been given, the symptoms leave from

<!-- chunk -->

### interior to exterior, from vital to less vital, and from top to bottom. As

<!-- chunk -->

### they come out they usually come to a “head.” There is a “healing crisis”

<!-- chunk -->

### during which the disease is re-experienced in its full nature—sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### psychological, sometimes physical, sometimes both. The homeopathic

<!-- chunk -->

### physicians called this the “aggravation.” They did not think of it as a law

<!-- chunk -->

### of healing, but it is. The idea of a “law of the healing crisis” goes all the

<!-- chunk -->

### way back to Hippocrates.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Hippocratic physicians used a single method of healing no matter

<!-- chunk -->

### what the nature of the illness or the constitution of the patient. This

<!-- chunk -->

### technique is today called the “detoxification fast.” A person is placed on

<!-- chunk -->

### a light diet that removes all foods causing an encumbrance on the self-

<!-- chunk -->

### healing ability of the organism. After a while, the organism begins to

<!-- chunk -->

### “detoxify.” That is to say, digestive, metabolic, and eliminative channels

<!-- chunk -->

### that were not working in the past begin to work again, causing an

<!-- chunk -->

### increase in tissue feeding and cleansing. The result is a healing crisis or

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification. The body begins to send out all the stored up toxins that

<!-- chunk -->

### it has not been able to eliminate. The sudden elimination causes a

<!-- chunk -->

### “crisis,” or the appearance of a disease. Afterwards, the patient is

<!-- chunk -->

### cleansed and well, unless the discharges showed the Hippocratic

<!-- chunk -->

### physicians that the internal cleansing was incomplete.

<!-- chunk -->

### This principle mimics nature. Lindlahr observed that there was a

<!-- chunk -->

### “disease crisis” created when the disease took command of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Instead of a detoxification, there is toxification as the body loses the

<!-- chunk -->

### ability to feed and cleanse itself appropriately. This is relived and

<!-- chunk -->

### released in the healing crisis.

<!-- chunk -->

### The law of the healing crisis is observed when herbal and

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathic substances are used. In homeopathy it is often noted that

<!-- chunk -->

### the appropriate remedy causes an aggravation of the symptoms. In

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalism, there is a tendency to use herbs to detoxify in a heavy-handed

<!-- chunk -->

### manner. Laxatives and liver stimulants are given to fire up the channels

<!-- chunk -->

### of metabolism and elimination. In fact, what is more important is that

<!-- chunk -->

### the well-selected herb or formula causes the body to react by cleansing

<!-- chunk -->

### itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### Ultimately, the law of the healing crisis correlates with what today is

<!-- chunk -->

### called the “body memory.” There is no true healing until the trauma

<!-- chunk -->

### remembered by the bodily intelligence is eliminated. This is encoded

<!-- chunk -->

### into the body, resulting in the production of characteristic symptoms and

<!-- chunk -->

### discharges, until the body can relive the trauma fully through the

<!-- chunk -->

### healing crisis and be released from its sleep of enchantment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the healing crisis will come when a person is not doing

<!-- chunk -->

### anything in particular to seek a cure. Dr. Bernard Jensen (1979, 34)

<!-- chunk -->

### makes a very insightful comment. “A crisis comes usually after you feel

<!-- chunk -->

### your best. It is the will of nature. No doctor, no patient, no food, can

<!-- chunk -->

### bring a crisis on. It comes when your body is ready.” However, he says

<!-- chunk -->

### that we can “earn” the crisis by hard work.

<!-- chunk -->

### A similar event occurs just before a severe deterioration or death. A

<!-- chunk -->

### person suddenly feels better, as if himself again. Then, a few days later

<!-- chunk -->

### he is sent to meet his maker.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Practice of Herbal Medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### Once we have isolated the kind, seat, and context of the disease, we can

<!-- chunk -->

### apply the specific remedy, or several interrelated specifics, or a well-

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated compound. Let us consider an example of how this works. Say

<!-- chunk -->

### we have determined that we have a condition of heat/irritation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach. In addition, we note the context: the skin is dry and red, so

<!-- chunk -->

### there is heat blocked in the periphery of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### We have a half dozen common sedatives for gastric heat and irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

### We also have a dozen more remedies which, though they do not as act

<!-- chunk -->

### primarily on the stomach or heat/irritation, might under certain

<!-- chunk -->

### circumstances. We also have several agents that might open the skin and

<!-- chunk -->

### release the internal heat. In order to arrive at a final prescription, we

<!-- chunk -->

### need understand which of these remedies is suited to this particular

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance. In order to do this we need a knowledge of the specific

<!-- chunk -->

### indications associated with each medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Most of the remedies for gastric heat/irritation have the following

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms: elongated tongue with red tip and body; stomach burning

<!-- chunk -->

### and acidity; acid eructations and reflux; some amount of nervousness,

<!-- chunk -->

### insomnia, excess thinking. or worrying; and amelioration from water

<!-- chunk -->

### (since it dilutes acids). However, each remedy has differentiating

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms that “separate it from the crowd.” For instance, Rheum

<!-- chunk -->

### (rhubarb) is more precise where there are constrictive pains in the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach or abdomen (irritation combined with constriction), while

<!-- chunk -->

### Rumex crispus (yellow dock root) has a loose, weak feeling in the rectum

<!-- chunk -->

### after stool (irritation and relaxation). Both these remedies have more of

<!-- chunk -->

### a dark red color in the mucosa, tongue, and skin, whereas Amygdalus

<!-- chunk -->

### (peach) has a tongue that is more red/pink or carmine and a skin that

<!-- chunk -->

### looks more like it is dry, sensitive, or lightly sunburned. Melissa has

<!-- chunk -->

### more anxiety in the symptom picture but not the outright fear of its

<!-- chunk -->

### cousin, Lycopus. Hypericum, Lycopus, and Amygdalus are suited to more

<!-- chunk -->

### drying in association with heat than the others are. The skin of Rumex

<!-- chunk -->

### may even weep serum. Hypericum has more association with atrophy of

<!-- chunk -->

### the stomach, where there are wrongs of instinct and weaknesses in the

<!-- chunk -->

### solar plexus. Sambucus can have heat in the stomach and a dry, red skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Althea would be indicated if there is drying out of the internal fluids

<!-- chunk -->

### (red, cracked tongue). By careful study we can determine which of these

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies is most likely to be the specific, curative medicine, or we can

<!-- chunk -->

### select a few compatible remedies to work together.

<!-- chunk -->

### Let’s illustrate specific medicine with some examples from practice.

<!-- chunk -->

### Recently I was called to see a young woman who was vomiting through

<!-- chunk -->

### the fifth to tenth weeks of her first pregnancy. She would retch hour

<!-- chunk -->

### after hour until she was dehydrated and exhausted. She had been to the

<!-- chunk -->

### hospital four times, once a week. They gave her intravenous fluids and

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition. The drugs did not stop the retching. Every drop of fluid or

<!-- chunk -->

### food at home would set off another round of nausea. She was now

<!-- chunk -->

### getting dizzy, had a headache all the time and tightness in the shoulders.

<!-- chunk -->

### The tip of the tongue was bright red, extending to a light red along the

<!-- chunk -->

### sides. This indicated that the nausea was from heat. One remedy is

<!-- chunk -->

### specific for a red tipped tongue with nausea, worse from every drop of

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid or food. I put some peach twig tincture on her wrists (she did not

<!-- chunk -->

### want to take alcohol) and the symptoms subsided literally within

<!-- chunk -->

### seconds. Drinking water with peach twig tincture (boiled to take out the

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol) cured the condition in a short time. She and her husband were

<!-- chunk -->

### very grateful. They had no health insurance.

<!-- chunk -->

### I could not help but recall a similar case, about ten years previous,

<!-- chunk -->

### which had also been treated with a specific remedy. A thirty-one-year-

<!-- chunk -->

### old woman had been nauseated and retching from the moment of

<!-- chunk -->

### conception. She had an abortion after a month because of the misery,

<!-- chunk -->

### but this did not stop the painful vomiting, which continued another

<!-- chunk -->

### month. Her pulse felt sharply tense. She was kind of crouching or

<!-- chunk -->

### contorted from the tension. I gave Lobelia 6x. The herb would have been

<!-- chunk -->

### just as good, but the homeopathic was at hand. The cramp stopped

<!-- chunk -->

### literally immediately and she wet the chair with menstrual blood before

<!-- chunk -->

### she could get to the bathroom. Nothing more was needed.

<!-- chunk -->

### These two cases resemble each other but in one the symptoms indicate

<!-- chunk -->

### heat while in the other they indicate tension. Because the remedies were

<!-- chunk -->

### specific to nausea from heat, and nausea from tension respectively, they

<!-- chunk -->

### brought prompt and lasting cure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prompt and radical cure is what we can expect from specific diagnosis

<!-- chunk -->

### and medication, but only some of the time. Unfortunately, we often do

<!-- chunk -->

### not always get a clear picture of the underlying cause or location of the

<!-- chunk -->

### disease, or enough information to find a specific. Sometimes we

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribe without really knowing what is going on inside the organism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes we see a specific indication pointing to a remedy and get a

<!-- chunk -->

### good cure without understanding what was going on. Our method is

<!-- chunk -->

### precise but the field is vast and not completely knowable.

<!-- chunk -->

### We must remember the first aphorism of Hippocrates: “The art so long

<!-- chunk -->

### to study, the life so short.” It is not possible for the young practitioner to

<!-- chunk -->

### master the vast field of herbal medicine. Generally, the beginner learns

<!-- chunk -->

### where his or her facility is greatest. Some people are better at

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding the body, while others are better with the herbs. These

<!-- chunk -->

### limitations are true in my case.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a case history illustrating successful prescription from a

<!-- chunk -->

### paucity of symptoms. The patient was a seven-year-old girl, thin, with

<!-- chunk -->

### fine hair and a somewhat refined, intelligent disposition. She had

<!-- chunk -->

### stomachaches that were increasing in intensity over the previous month

<!-- chunk -->

### to the point where she was now afraid to eat and was eating less. The

<!-- chunk -->

### doctor found nothing wrong. The pains come and go slowly, after eating,

<!-- chunk -->

### and are situated in the abdomen above the navel. There is no gas. She

<!-- chunk -->

### had a dairy allergy as a younger child, and was nursed for over a year.

<!-- chunk -->

### As an infant she used to spit up a lot. In addition, she has had

<!-- chunk -->

### incontinence since age three. Her tongue is slightly coated. The lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### gas indicated that dry/atrophy was not the problem. Damp/relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

### seemed more likely, with the easy spitting-up of infancy, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### incontinence. I gave a tincture of two parts Rumex crispus, Comptonia,

<!-- chunk -->

### and Alchemilla, one part Quercus, and three parts Osmunda. To my

<!-- chunk -->

### surprise, both the stomach ache and the incontinence were cured in two

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks. About a year later, the child was brought back for other

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. Generally, this is what we have to expect when we have only

<!-- chunk -->

### prescribed generally and have not gotten the specific cure.

<!-- chunk -->

### The beginning herbalist has my sympathy. At first, cure is a rumor. We

<!-- chunk -->

### hear a story about healing with herbs. The good teacher builds on this

<!-- chunk -->

### simple platform. He or she tells stories about healing that convey the

<!-- chunk -->

### authenticity of herbal medicine to the student. Later the student sees

<!-- chunk -->

### cure, and it becomes a personal experience. Subsequently, it becomes

<!-- chunk -->

### more and more common. Finally, practice becomes systematic. In the

<!-- chunk -->

### end, the herbalist will evolve a personal, individualized method. The

<!-- chunk -->

### teacher needs to stand back, let go, and let another herbalist prosper.

<!-- chunk -->

### It takes about fifteen years of continual practice to begin to see many

<!-- chunk -->

### connections and fill in the blanks. “The study is difficult,” concedes

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder (1874, iv). Eventually the time comes when one can stand on

<!-- chunk -->

### the mountaintop, overlooking a vast but sensible field of medicine plants

<!-- chunk -->

### and knowledge. Herbs and their uses, the body and its reactions, become

<!-- chunk -->

### more and more predictable. Even then, the final secrets belong to Dame

<!-- chunk -->

### Nature and the Creator.

HOMSON

<!-- chunk -->

### he old granny doctors and traditional physicians looked to the

<!-- chunk -->

### “condition of the skin,” as they called it, to understand what was

<!-- chunk -->

### going on deeper in the body. Although they did not know modern

<!-- chunk -->

### physiology, their approach stood on solid scientific ground because the

<!-- chunk -->

### condition of the skin reflects the condition of the grand regulator of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, the hypothalamus. The latter regulates the periphery as a “shield”

<!-- chunk -->

### to protect the interior organs from sudden environmental changes. It

<!-- chunk -->

### opens and closes the “vents” of the periphery to increase or decrease

<!-- chunk -->

### blood volume and perspiration. It signals the sympathetic to induce

<!-- chunk -->

### shivering. Temperature-sensitive mechanisms in the center and

<!-- chunk -->

### periphery send information to the hypothalamus, so that it can regulate

<!-- chunk -->

### the overall body temperature. The center is slightly warmer (99.4°), so

<!-- chunk -->

### there is a flow of heat outwards to the periphery (98.6°). The

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothalamus also largely governs the interior by secreting hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### that oversee endocrine regulation of temperature, fluids, solids,

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, growth, maturation, and reproduction. Through regulation

<!-- chunk -->

### of the thyroid it exerts a control on metabolism and circulation to the

<!-- chunk -->

### periphery.

<!-- chunk -->

### The old granny healers and traditional physicians manipulated these

<!-- chunk -->

### “vents” to cure fevers and correct weaknesses resulting from fever. The

<!-- chunk -->

### skin might remain too dried out or too prone to sweating, too full of

<!-- chunk -->

### blood and hot, or empty, cool, and pale. Shivering might continue long

<!-- chunk -->

### after the original malaria or influenza had disappeared. They observed

<!-- chunk -->

### that when a fever “broke,” sweat appeared on the skin. Thus, they used

<!-- chunk -->

### diaphoretics to induce sweating and clear fever. This was the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### technique of clearing acute disease in traditional medicine, not “germ-

<!-- chunk -->

### killing” or “immune-boosting.” By following out these processes they

<!-- chunk -->

### learned that the skin acted as an eliminative channel for waste material

<!-- chunk -->

### produced by the illness in the deeper tissues and organs. This led to the

<!-- chunk -->

### realization that there was an orderly flow within the organism, from

<!-- chunk -->

### interior to exterior.

<!-- chunk -->

### A particularly lucid summary of these ideas occurs in Samuel

<!-- chunk -->

### Thomson’s work. His mentor, the “widow Benton,” taught him the

<!-- chunk -->

### importance of diaphoresis. Later he drew a metaphorical picture of the

<!-- chunk -->

### way the body works in health and disease. He likened it to a fountain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The stomach is the center. If the fires of digestion are strong the body is

<!-- chunk -->

### nourished and the “inner fire” radiating towards the surface will be

<!-- chunk -->

### strong. Heat, life, and nourishment will flow outward to the periphery. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the pores of the skin and other channels of transportation and

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination are open, the organism will clean itself out. However, if the

<!-- chunk -->

### center is cold, phlegm coats the stomach, preventing digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

### keeping it “cold.” Or, if the periphery is blocked, there will be faulty

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination. As long as the fountain bubbles forth from interior to

<!-- chunk -->

### exterior there will be health, but if the heat in the center dies down or

<!-- chunk -->

### the heat at the periphery is raised by cold blocking an outlet, the flow

<!-- chunk -->

### stops. Thomson did not equate death with cold, but with the

<!-- chunk -->

### equalization of the inner temperature with the outer. It was the lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### flow that caused life to cease. Homeopathy elegantly expresses the same

<!-- chunk -->

### basic idea in the “law of direction of cure,” or “Hering’s law.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These concepts are not just the daydreams of alternative practitioners,

<!-- chunk -->

### but reflect physiological activities. The peripheral vents are manipulated

<!-- chunk -->

### by the hypothalamus to counteract environmental stress. If the surface is

<!-- chunk -->

### chilled or overheated, it will take the necessary measures to return the

<!-- chunk -->

### surface to a healthy balance. It really is true that we can “catch” a cold

<!-- chunk -->

### because external cold can overwhelm these peripheral, adaptive

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanisms of the body, causing a physiological trauma which remains

<!-- chunk -->

### with the organism after the external stimuli has passed on. Any such

<!-- chunk -->

### trauma invites in microorganisms, which live off the imbalanced

<!-- chunk -->

### environment. They secrete toxins which inhibit the normal bodily

<!-- chunk -->

### functions to insure their continuing propagation at the expense of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body. Of course, it is also true that the penetration of a bacteria or virus

<!-- chunk -->

### can be the initial causative agent, as well as “cold.” Even then, the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism creates a change in the internal environment analogous to the

<!-- chunk -->

### effect of heat or cold, so the end result is very much the same.

<!-- chunk -->

### The modern approach is to “kill the bacteria.” Thus, we have

<!-- chunk -->

### antibiotics, while alternative practitioners, aping the mainstream, use

<!-- chunk -->

### their various “natural” antibiotics. This, however, was not the approach

<!-- chunk -->

### of the traditional healers. They did not try to kill the little critters

<!-- chunk -->

### directly, but to change the environment that either led to the invasion in

<!-- chunk -->

### the first place or was caused by the invasion. This is the reason why

<!-- chunk -->

### diaphoretics play such an important part in the old literature.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sometimes the disease moves further into the body, causing acute

<!-- chunk -->

### respiratory disease or “stomach flu.” It is for this reason that traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### healers around the world used emetics as well as diaphoretics. The lungs

<!-- chunk -->

### and stomach are both innervated by the vagus nerve (called the

<!-- chunk -->

### pneumogastric in the old literature). Stimulation of the vagus tends to

<!-- chunk -->

### cause ejection through expectoration or emesis. It also raises the cold

<!-- chunk -->

### phlegm coating the stomach and dampening the internal fire, a matter of

<!-- chunk -->

### great concern to Thomson and to traditional Ayurvedic medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the peripheral barrier is pierced, the skin will assume a disturbed

<!-- chunk -->

### character—too hot, cold, damp, dry. The disease will then move to a

<!-- chunk -->

### deeper level. The lymphatic vessels under the skin will be engaged

<!-- chunk -->

### bringing in white cells to kill bacteria and carrying away dead white

<!-- chunk -->

### cells, bacteria, and toxins. There will be stress on the lymphatic system,

<!-- chunk -->

### which may cause tenderness, swelling, and congestion in the glands.

<!-- chunk -->

### Other peripheral tissues, such as the muscles, will be affected by the

<!-- chunk -->

### increase of fluids in the interstitial spaces around the engorged blood

<!-- chunk -->

### and lymph vessels, resulting in soreness and stiffness. It is only at this

<!-- chunk -->

### level that the body itself begins “critter killin’ ” with various white cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### If the disease process is not held in the periphery it will move to the

<!-- chunk -->

### deeper organs, at last causing problems at the level of function and

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation. The liver will be stressed to detoxify an additional load of

<!-- chunk -->

### dead bacteria, white cells, and toxins. The kidneys will be stressed to

<!-- chunk -->

### carry away protein waste products. Indeed, we often find that the urine

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes scanty and concentrated, and water is retained, before the fever

<!-- chunk -->

### reaches its releasing crisis. The pulse is increased to move the blood

<!-- chunk -->

### through the congestion in the periphery in a fever or chill, causing the

<!-- chunk -->

### heart to speed up.

<!-- chunk -->

### With increased pulse there is often a shift towards the sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system. Thus, the disease finally affects the centers regulating

<!-- chunk -->

### the metabolism, fluids, and solids of the body, as well as the nervous and

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrine systems. These are themselves largely regulated by the

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothalamus. The entire defensive mechanism, from beginning to end,

<!-- chunk -->

### is more or less under the dominion of this powerful “master gland.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Three Functional Levels

<!-- chunk -->

### There are three basic levels or spheres of activity in the organism. The

<!-- chunk -->

### most internal is the regulatory system that rules both the periphery

<!-- chunk -->

### where the defensive mechanisms are situated and the vital organs that

<!-- chunk -->

### undertake the basic functions of life—nutrition, metabolism, elimination,

<!-- chunk -->

### and so forth. From outer to inner we have:

<!-- chunk -->

## DefensivePeripheral “vents” (skin, mucosa)

<!-- chunk -->

## FunctionalVital organs

<!-- chunk -->

## RegulatoryNeuroendocrine system, hypothalamus

<!-- chunk -->

### Health problems tend to penetrate from the exterior, deranging the

<!-- chunk -->

### vital organs, and then the regulatory system. Problems can also move in

<!-- chunk -->

### the opposite direction—from interior to exterior. This is where the

<!-- chunk -->

### theory of toxemia enters the picture. The vital organs are not able to

<!-- chunk -->

### handle their work so there are metabolic leftovers that seek an outlet

<!-- chunk -->

### through the peripheral or defensive layer. The problem could even begin

<!-- chunk -->

### on the regulatory level with changes in temperature and water

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation percolating up through the organs to the surface.

<!-- chunk -->

### An important observation to be made is that the skin will always show

<!-- chunk -->

### the “dragon tracks” of disease. If the disease has penetrated from the

<!-- chunk -->

### exterior, the skin will remain too red and hot, or too cold and pale, or

<!-- chunk -->

### too dry, or sweat excessively, showing the “track” the disease took to get

<!-- chunk -->

### to the interior. If the disease originated in an internal weakness it causes

<!-- chunk -->

### a disturbance in the skin. Toxins, excessive heat, cold, dry, or damp will

<!-- chunk -->

### try to move from the interior to the exterior, in an effort to unburden the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism.

<!-- chunk -->

### I almost always find that when the appropriate remedy has been

<!-- chunk -->

### selected the skin will change to a more healthy expression. We do not

<!-- chunk -->

### always need to treat the deep internal organs and glands. Sometimes all

<!-- chunk -->

### we need to do is correct the condition of the skin, clear channels of

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination, remove toxins, or get the lymph moving. These are precisely

<!-- chunk -->

### the sorts of things that the old healers accompanied by changing such

<!-- chunk -->

### simple agents as food, water, exercise, and herbs.

<!-- chunk -->

### Due to limitations of space, in this volume we will only examine the

<!-- chunk -->

### defensive and regulatory levels. The neuroendocrine is the leading

<!-- chunk -->

### regulatory system from a modern perceptive, while fever and blood are

<!-- chunk -->

### the leading “systems” in nineteenth-century herbal medicine. Many of

<!-- chunk -->

### the most important remedies in the Western herbal materia medica act

<!-- chunk -->

### on the defensive level (fever), regulation, and blood. We count here the

<!-- chunk -->

### great febrifuges, diaphoretics, nervines, blood builders, antiseptics, and

<!-- chunk -->

### blood purifiers of Western herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Primal Tradition

<!-- chunk -->

### The importance of the skin, the self-governance of the organism, and

<!-- chunk -->

### regulation from center to circumference are features of traditional folk

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. Samuel Thomson was one of the few folk doctors to work

<!-- chunk -->

### them into a consistent medical philosophy. He learned his basic system

<!-- chunk -->

### by observing the practice of Mrs. Benton, an herbalist who treated his

<!-- chunk -->

### family when he was a child (Narrative, 1825, 15):

<!-- chunk -->

### There was an old lady by the name of Benton lived near us, who

<!-- chunk -->

### used to attend our family when there was any sickness. At that

<!-- chunk -->

### time there was no such thing as a Doctor known among us; there

<!-- chunk -->

### not being any within ten miles. The whole of her practice was

<!-- chunk -->

### with roots and herbs, applied to the patient, or given in hot

<!-- chunk -->

### drinks, to produce sweating; which always answered the purpose.

<!-- chunk -->

### When one thing did not produce the desired effect, she would try

<!-- chunk -->

### something else, till they were relieved. By her attention to the

<!-- chunk -->

### family, and the benefits they received from her skill, we became

<!-- chunk -->

### very much attached to her; and when she used to go out to collect

<!-- chunk -->

### roots and herbs, she would take me with her, and learn me their

<!-- chunk -->

### names, with what they were good for; and I used to be very

<!-- chunk -->

### curious in my inquiries, and in tasting every thing I found. The

<!-- chunk -->

### information I thus obtained at this early age, was afterwards of

<!-- chunk -->

### great use to me.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Mrs. Benton” has been tentatively identified as Mehitable Crane, wife of

<!-- chunk -->

### Elijah Benton, of Surrey, New Hampshire (Kingsbury, 1925, 904).

<!-- chunk -->

### Years later, when Thomson was working out his medical doctrines, he

<!-- chunk -->

### returned to Mrs. Benton’s basic practice, concluding that perspiration

<!-- chunk -->

### was the central element in successful treatment (Narrative, 1825, 43):

<!-- chunk -->

### I found that all disorders which the human family were afflicted

<!-- chunk -->

### with, however various the symptoms, and different the names by

<!-- chunk -->

### which they are called, arise directly from obstructed perspiration,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is always caused by cold, or want of heat; for if there is a

<!-- chunk -->

### natural heat, it is impossible but that there must be a natural

<!-- chunk -->

### perspiration.

<!-- chunk -->

### This same complex of ideas is found in Latin American folk medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### In 1985 anthropologist George M. Foster published an article defining

<!-- chunk -->

### basic treatment methods for the first time (“How to Get Well in

<!-- chunk -->

### Tzintzuntzan,” Sci. Soc. Med., v. 21, pp. 809–818). The four primary

<!-- chunk -->

### methods of healing are (1) sweating medicines (or the sweat lodge in

<!-- chunk -->

### Indian communities); (2) warming medicines; (3) the removal of

<!-- chunk -->

### empacho, a mucus-like substance lining the digestive tract; and (4)

<!-- chunk -->

### counteracting the evil eye. Except for the final method, Latin folk

<!-- chunk -->

### practice is similar to Thomson medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### This complex of ideas probably represents the bedrock of European

<!-- chunk -->

### peasant medicine meeting up with the vigorous indigenous practices of

<!-- chunk -->

### Indian America. Thomson’s basic theories bear the stamp of both

<!-- chunk -->

### traditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thomson’s folk-medical system also shows surprising analogies to the

<!-- chunk -->

### most famous and basic tenets of Ayurvedic medicine. In this system, the

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive/metabolic fire in the center of the organism is visualized as

<!-- chunk -->

### residing in the pyloric sphincter between the stomach and duodenum. At

<!-- chunk -->

### the same time, this primal fire is present throughout the body to allow

<!-- chunk -->

### feeding and waste removal. It is called the agni, the Sanskrit word for

<!-- chunk -->

### fire (related to the Latin root in the words igneous and ignition.) The

<!-- chunk -->

### agni is responsible for digestion, metabolism, gastric secretion, enzymes,

<!-- chunk -->

### immunity, and destruction of microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, and

<!-- chunk -->

### parasites. It also enhances perception, comprehension, and intelligence.

<!-- chunk -->

### When the agni is impaired, food particles are not entirely broken down

<!-- chunk -->

### or utilized, resulting in sluggish digestion, incomplete metabolism, dirty,

<!-- chunk -->

### clogged tissues, decreased immunity, increased disease processes, and

<!-- chunk -->

### obscuration of the mind.

<!-- chunk -->

### The offending materials, which escape the grasp of the agni and then

<!-- chunk -->

### work to oppose its influence in the organism, are called amma or toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

### The primary properties of amma are that it is heavy, cloudy, cold, slimy,

<!-- chunk -->

### thick, impure, and putrid. Putrefaction of amma causes a toxic, septic, or

<!-- chunk -->

### putrid heat that is disease producing. Characteristic symptoms of amma

<!-- chunk -->

### are loss of taste and appetite, coated tongue, indigestion, bad breath, bad

<!-- chunk -->

### odor of the body, urine and feces, loss of mental clarity, depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritability, lack of attention, heaviness, lethargy, fatigue, loss of

<!-- chunk -->

### strength, accumulation of waste materials, deep, heavy, or dull pulse.

<!-- chunk -->

### The Ayurvedic model emphasizes sweating, vomiting, and purging as

<!-- chunk -->

### means of eliminating amma and keeping the organism healthy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The basic tenets of Thomson’s system are three: opening the exterior,

<!-- chunk -->

### warming the periphery, and removing canker, humors, or toxins

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulating in the interior. Let us look at these three basic methods.

<!-- chunk -->

## Opening the Exterior

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout Indian America the sweat lodge was, and still is, the primary

<!-- chunk -->

### center for physical and spiritual healing. The lodge is not only a place

<!-- chunk -->

### where spirits talk, but where people perspire. The fire is hot, the water

<!-- chunk -->

### splashes on the rocks, the vapor rises, and the pores open. The Indian

<!-- chunk -->

### healers who helped their pioneer neighbors did not usually speak good

<!-- chunk -->

### English or describe what they were doing, but the pioneers learned by

<!-- chunk -->

### observing their methods. They adopted a simplified, non-ceremonial

<!-- chunk -->

### form of the sweat lodge or used diaphoretic herbal draughts to open the

<!-- chunk -->

### skin and raise a sweat.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lewis and Clark tell us how a passing Indian hunter cured one of their

<!-- chunk -->

### men of a debilitating muscular stiffening by erecting a sweat lodge. This

<!-- chunk -->

### was not an exceptional experience on the frontier. Many settlers

<!-- chunk -->

### observed the Indians sweating themselves to cure. Not surprisingly,

<!-- chunk -->

### “steaming doctors” were common in pioneer society in the 1820s and

<!-- chunk -->

### ’30s. Professional doctors followed suit, inventing steaming devices for

<!-- chunk -->

### use in more sophisticated settings. These crossed the ocean and were

<!-- chunk -->

### widely used in Europe. There it was noted that the Finns used a sweat

<!-- chunk -->

### lodge for their health.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of Thomson’s students, A. I. Coffin, describes how he learned the

<!-- chunk -->

### value of sweating from an old Indian practitioner. As a small boy, he fell

<!-- chunk -->

### sick with a respiratory condition. The doctors failed to cure him and he

<!-- chunk -->

### was given up to die. About that time an old “gipsy-looking woman” of a

<!-- chunk -->

### neighboring remnant of the Seneca came by his house. She saw him and

<!-- chunk -->

### commented, “white man no cure you.” She spoke to his mother and

<!-- chunk -->

### offered to doctor him in exchange for a gallon of cider (a reasonable

<!-- chunk -->

### payment for medical services in those days). The old woman was

<!-- chunk -->

### employed. The stranger terrified young Albert Isaiah, but to please his

<!-- chunk -->

### mother he agreed to cooperate. The woman went out in the woods and

<!-- chunk -->

### returned with some medicines, one of which Coffin recognized as prickly

<!-- chunk -->

### ash. She made a strong decoction and the boy drank. In a short while he

<!-- chunk -->

### experienced, as he says, “a comfortable glow diffusing itself over my

<!-- chunk -->

### whole frame.” Soon, “a pleasant moisture bedewed my hands, and I felt

<!-- chunk -->

### as one reprieved from a sentence of death.” He exclaimed with joy, “The

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine will cure me” (original sources quoted by Barbara Griggs,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1981, 200). The full cure took several weeks. In his Botanic Guide, Coffin

<!-- chunk -->

### says simply, “We stand indebted to that poor unlettered Indian woman”

<!-- chunk -->

### (1890, 11).

<!-- chunk -->

### Coffin later went on to practice Thomson herbalism and brought it to

<!-- chunk -->

### Great Britain. The fact that his teachings met with enormous success

<!-- chunk -->

### indicates that, again, these teachings were recognized by the common

<!-- chunk -->

### people. Thomson herbalism was widely used by the English working

<!-- chunk -->

### class until the middle of the twentieth century.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another frontier doctor, Beal P. Downing, describes the Indian mode

<!-- chunk -->

### of sweating in Reformed Practice and Family Physician (1851, 161):

<!-- chunk -->

### I was among the Indians in the West [i.e., Midwest] four years,

<!-- chunk -->

### and did not find but one down with a fever; but saw many

<!-- chunk -->

### sweating themselves over a hot stone, by turning water on it, and

<!-- chunk -->

### covered with a blanket. Fever is the same in all countries, and

<!-- chunk -->

### with all classes of the human species, at the commencement; and

<!-- chunk -->

### the same thing will cure all, if taken in season. Some are attacked

<!-- chunk -->

### more violently than others, and then they are alarmed and send

<!-- chunk -->

### for the doctor, but he cannot cure it unless he can open the pores

<!-- chunk -->

### of the skin, and warm the stomach. Bleeding and giving cold

<!-- chunk -->

### minerals runs the patient down.

<!-- chunk -->

### This was also the essential method Downing had been taught in

<!-- chunk -->

### medical school by Nathan Smith, one of the leading lights of medical

<!-- chunk -->

### education in New England at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

<!-- chunk -->

### Downing writes: “I received a part of my knowledge of cure and disease

<!-- chunk -->

### of the great Dr. Smith, who lectured and dissected at Dartmouth College,

<!-- chunk -->

### in New Hampshire, forty years ago. He told me that a sweat at the

<!-- chunk -->

### commencement of a fever was better for a patient than all the medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### in the shops; for, says he, sweat opens the pores. Then give physic

<!-- chunk -->

### [purgatives] and strengthening bitters. It is all that is wanted in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### stages of a fever.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Smith’s method differs somewhat from that attributed by Downing to

<!-- chunk -->

### the Indian people. The former consists of sweating, purging, and

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthening, while the native approach is to “open the pores” and

<!-- chunk -->

### “warm the stomach.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The importance of keeping the skin open was known to some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### highest society doctors in America and Europe. Dr. Joseph Kidd,

<!-- chunk -->

### physician to Benjamin Disraeli, treated his eminent client by

<!-- chunk -->

### reestablishing long-absent perspiration through use of a “lamp bath.” In

<!-- chunk -->

### The Last Illness of Lord Beaconsfield (Trueherz, 195, 103), Dr. Kidd writes:

<!-- chunk -->

### The albuminuria (Bright’s disease of the kidney) was wasting his

<!-- chunk -->

### strength and was much aggravated by the dry state of the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Regarding it as the most important indication for treatment, I

<!-- chunk -->

### advised the regular use of a lamp bath at bedtime for fifteen

<!-- chunk -->

### minutes, and to sleep in a nightdress and sheets of soft Saxony

<!-- chunk -->

### flannel. At first he rebelled at this. “You say you want me to

<!-- chunk -->

### perspire. I never did since I was born. I have had a dry skin all my

<!-- chunk -->

### life. It is useless for you to try.” But he obeyed as I explained its

<!-- chunk -->

### importance for the relief of the kidneys.

<!-- chunk -->

### About three months after this treatment was commenced at one

<!-- chunk -->

### of my morning visits, while I was feeling his skin carefully, he

<!-- chunk -->

### looked up with a most genial smile. “You have conquered,” he

<!-- chunk -->

### said; “I perspired freely last night.” Gradually his skin became soft

<!-- chunk -->

### like a child’s and a gentle moisture all night added to the comfort

<!-- chunk -->

### of his life; the morning depression vanished and the albuminuria

<!-- chunk -->

### lessened, his old freshness and vigor returned.

<!-- chunk -->

### This was in 1878, when Disraeli was expected to die. He lived until

<!-- chunk -->

### 1881, when he finally succumbed to Bright’s Disease.

<!-- chunk -->

## Warming the Interior

<!-- chunk -->

### Thomson saw the importance of maintaining the central fire, as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### opening the periphery. The stomach was the seat of this central fire and

<!-- chunk -->

### it must be kept warm and healthy (Botanic Guide, 1825, 8): “The

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach is the deposit from which the whole body is supported. The

<!-- chunk -->

### heat is maintained in the stomach by consuming food; and all the body

<!-- chunk -->

### and limbs receive their proportion of nourishment and heat from that

<!-- chunk -->

### source; as the whole room is warmed by the fire which is consumed in

<!-- chunk -->

### the fireplace.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The natural heat in the center of the body is continually radiating out

<!-- chunk -->

### to the periphery, dominating the economy of the body in all its activities

<!-- chunk -->

### and parts, maintaining it against the cold, toxins, and attacks from the

<!-- chunk -->

### outward environment. Thomson attributes death to the cessation in this

<!-- chunk -->

### outward movement. “It is immaterial whether we lose this power by

<!-- chunk -->

### losing the inward heat or raising the outward heat about it, as the effect

<!-- chunk -->

### is the same,” writes Thomson (1825, 17). “When the outward heat

<!-- chunk -->

### becomes equal with the inward … cold assumes the power and death

<!-- chunk -->

### takes place.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Working with this simple model, Thomson concluded that there were

<!-- chunk -->

### three basic kinds of disease. The first was hot: external heat invades the

<!-- chunk -->

### interior and dominates the organism. The second was cold: internal heat

<!-- chunk -->

### dies down in the organism or it is overwhelmed by external cold. The

<!-- chunk -->

### third is an alternation of heat and cold: cold is “stuck” in the periphery

<!-- chunk -->

### and the forces fight for ascendancy (Botanic Guide, 1825, 14, 16, 18).

<!-- chunk -->

### These three disease patterns anticipated the threefold classification of

<!-- chunk -->

### disease adopted by his student, Dr. Alvah Curtis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Since all disease had one basic cause, Thomson concluded that only

<!-- chunk -->

### one basic cure was needed. “All the art required to [cure] is to know

<!-- chunk -->

### what medicine will do it, and how to administer it, as a person knows

<!-- chunk -->

### how to clear a stove and the pipe when clogged with soot” (Narrative,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1825, 45).

<!-- chunk -->

## Removing Canker

<!-- chunk -->

### The old physicians taught that chronic disease was caused by thickened

<!-- chunk -->

### “humors” which had to be thinned by improving digestion, restoring the

<!-- chunk -->

### internal fire, and opening the channels of elimination. In the eighteenth

<!-- chunk -->

### and early nineteenth centuries these humors came to be known as

<!-- chunk -->

### canker in folk medicine. This idea was replaced by the concept of

<!-- chunk -->

### “impurities in the blood” and finally, in the twentieth century, by

<!-- chunk -->

### “toxins.” This subject has already been taken up in the previous chapter.

<!-- chunk -->

### The old authorities visualized canker as both a lining on the

<!-- chunk -->

### gastrointestinal mucosa and a substance burdening the internal organs.

<!-- chunk -->

### The idea has classical origins. Galen taught that the stomach separated

<!-- chunk -->

### food into pure and impure portions. The pure parts adhered to the wall

<!-- chunk -->

### of the stomach. From there they were absorbed into the interior, while

<!-- chunk -->

### the impure was moved down the alimentary tract for further digestion. If

<!-- chunk -->

### the digestate was particularly thick, adhesive, or heavy, it might adhere

<!-- chunk -->

### to the lining of the stomach, resulting in sluggish gastric digestion, slow

<!-- chunk -->

### transfer of food to the interior, lowered nutrition, and diminished heat

<!-- chunk -->

### radiating out from the stomach to the rest of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### This idea continued to persist in professional medicine during the

<!-- chunk -->

### eighteenth century. The standard medical text for home use at that time

<!-- chunk -->

### was Dr. William Buchan’s Domestic Medicine. The sixth edition of 1779—

<!-- chunk -->

### the copy I have originally belonged to my ancestor, Thomas Pearsall of

<!-- chunk -->

### Westbury, Long Island—describes “cold viscid phlegm” adhering to the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach and bowels (1779, 160). He recommends both emetics and

<!-- chunk -->

### purgatives for its removal.

<!-- chunk -->

### In both Anglo and Latin America, the doctrine of thick, impure phlegm

<!-- chunk -->

### clinging to the wall of the stomach was elevated to a level of great

<!-- chunk -->

### importance when other traditional concepts passed away. Indeed, it had

<!-- chunk -->

### not completely disappeared even in conventional medicine in the early

<!-- chunk -->

### twentieth century. As late as 1924, Dr. Henry Harrower (1924, 139)

<!-- chunk -->

### graphically describes the “poultice” of mucus on the walls of the

<!-- chunk -->

### intestines: “the alimentary wall is covered with a more or less irritating,

<!-- chunk -->

### poison-filled blanket.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Thomson learned about canker from his mentor, Mrs. Benton. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### child he was afflicted with the “canker rash,” or scarlet fever. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### thought that the canker rises from the interior to the skin, blocks the

<!-- chunk -->

### pores, and creates a high fever. Mrs. Benton gave the boy a decoction of

<!-- chunk -->

### cocoash or red-stalked aster (Aster puniceus), a specific for “canker rash”

<!-- chunk -->

### (Thomson, Narrative, 1825, 18; 1842, 608).

<!-- chunk -->

### Although canker is a central feature in Thomson’s medical system, he

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves no good definition of it in his writings. Apparently he believed

<!-- chunk -->

### that his readers knew what he is talking about. This alone says

<!-- chunk -->

### something about the prevalence of the concept at that time in folk

<!-- chunk -->

### culture. For a good definition we turn to Dr. Downing (1851, 187):

<!-- chunk -->

### Cold affects the stomach, and makes it cold, then the pores of the

<!-- chunk -->

### skin close, and the imperceivable perspiration is thrown into the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach and becomes there an adhesive substance or matter,

<!-- chunk -->

### called phlegm.… If allowed to remain on the stomach, it becomes

<!-- chunk -->

### tough and stringy, and fills the velvety part of the coat of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach, and that becomes smooth and glossed over, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### gastric juice is not able to remove it, or to digest the food. The

<!-- chunk -->

### food not being digested, does not nourish the system, and then

<!-- chunk -->

### the patient runs down and becomes weak and sick. The phlegm

<!-- chunk -->

### lying on the stomach becomes corroded after the juice of the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach becomes commingled with it, and then it becomes

<!-- chunk -->

### cankerous, and the cankerous fluid is thrown into the chyle, and

<!-- chunk -->

### thence into the blood; is circulated through the system, and is

<!-- chunk -->

### deposited in the weakest places, and forms disease. The blood is

<!-- chunk -->

### carried into the liver with the impurity, and the liver is not able

<!-- chunk -->

### to cleanse it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Downing goes on to describe how canker causes disease in the interior

<!-- chunk -->

### of the organism. If the liver cannot handle canker, then other organs are

<!-- chunk -->

### affected. The impure blood moves up to the lungs, which cannot purify

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood, becomes a burden and destroys them. Or it moves to the

<!-- chunk -->

### heart, “the valves of the heart become loaded and occasion the

<!-- chunk -->

### palpitation of the heart, and apoplexy and sudden death.” Or it runs

<!-- chunk -->

### down to the kidneys, forms an obstruction, and causes “the kidney

<!-- chunk -->

### complaint.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Canker, as mentioned above, went on in folk medicine to become

<!-- chunk -->

### “impure blood,” “bad blood,” and finally, “toxins in the blood” or

<!-- chunk -->

### “toxemia.”

OLESCHOTT

<!-- chunk -->

### o far we have studied the primary patterns and functions which

<!-- chunk -->

### are most evident within the body. These are often associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### different locations and organs. As medicine developed, it became

<!-- chunk -->

### more evident how the functions and structures were related, and this

<!-- chunk -->

### became an important tool for understanding disease and making an

<!-- chunk -->

### accurate diagnosis. This era began about the time William Harvey

<!-- chunk -->

### discovered the true circulation of the blood and has not yet completely

<!-- chunk -->

### closed. We are still learning how the more complex parts of the body

<!-- chunk -->

### operate.

<!-- chunk -->

### In Western medicine, as practiced in the nineteenth and early

<!-- chunk -->

### twentieth centuries, the organ or system was often cited as the location

<!-- chunk -->

### of the disease. This was customary in both lay and professional

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. Even today we say we are having “stomach problems” or

<!-- chunk -->

### visiting a “heart doctor.” The problem was not located in the humor, as

<!-- chunk -->

### it once had been, nor in the molecular lesion, as it is in modern

<!-- chunk -->

### biomedicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is something very natural about locating the problem in an

<!-- chunk -->

### organ or system. These are the natural units within the body about

<!-- chunk -->

### which people tend to think. One of the Hippocratic writers said that it

<!-- chunk -->

### was not appropriate to either learn or practice according to information

<!-- chunk -->

### that the patients themselves could not understand. More importantly,

<!-- chunk -->

### disease tends to derange the basic functions and structures of the body

<!-- chunk -->

### long before it comes to the surface in a local lesion. Long before the

<!-- chunk -->

### ulcer, there was a problem of the stomach. Long before the heart attack,

<!-- chunk -->

### there was high blood pressure. Before that there was excessive weight

<!-- chunk -->

### gain and before that there was an over-active appetite, digestion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. Furthermore, it is upon these general functions and organs

<!-- chunk -->

### that herbs tend to expend their healing power. The great majority of

<!-- chunk -->

### them do not have affinities to specific lesions and tissue changes but to

<!-- chunk -->

### functional spheres. Of course, there are constitutional diseases, those

<!-- chunk -->

### that are found in the whole body, and there are local diseases, those

<!-- chunk -->

### which are found in a specific tissue or set of cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Modern biomedicine left behind the idea of general patterns of disease

<!-- chunk -->

### located in the general functions, organs, or systems of the body. That

<!-- chunk -->

### was the break that alienated biomedicine, not only from its roots in

<!-- chunk -->

### earlier Western medicine, but from all other systems of natural therapy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Primary Organizational Levels of the Body

<!-- chunk -->

### We cannot, however, go wrong with the understanding from

<!-- chunk -->

### biomedicine that there are four levels of organization in the living body:

<!-- chunk -->

### cell, tissue, organ, and system. The cell is the basic unit of life. Nutrition,

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism, and elimination constitute the basic functions of cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### life, determing the environment of cellular life.

<!-- chunk -->

### Cells in the body form into tissues, of which there are four basic kinds:

<!-- chunk -->

### muscular, nervous, epithelial, and connective. Epithelium forms the

<!-- chunk -->

### linings of the body, the skin, and mucosa. Those areas of the body

<!-- chunk -->

### exposed to the outside world are covered by epithelium. The unfolding

<!-- chunk -->

### epithelium forms secretory glands and, in combination with other

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues, these become the basis for the formation of the major visceral

<!-- chunk -->

### organs. The stomach, for example, represents a folding up of epithelium

<!-- chunk -->

### to become an enclosed mucous membrane with little secretory ducts

<!-- chunk -->

### releasing mucus and digestive juices. It is surrounded by muscular tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### that contracts the stomach so that it can churn and break up food. The

<!-- chunk -->

### whole organ is held together by connective tissue and innervated by

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous tissue to provide communication and instructions to or from the

<!-- chunk -->

### rest of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tissues and organs are the second and third level of organization in

<!-- chunk -->

### the body. The fourth level is that of the system. A group of organs

<!-- chunk -->

### together will perform an important function such as digestion or

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination. The stomach joins with the mouth, salivary glands,

<!-- chunk -->

### pharynx, esophagus, intestines, etc., to form the gastrointestinal,

<!-- chunk -->

### alimentary, or digestive tract. The system is often a functional unit, not a

<!-- chunk -->

### singular anatomical structure.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many of the organs comprising the system are just barely linked

<!-- chunk -->

### anatomically, and sometimes not linked at all. However, there is often a

<!-- chunk -->

### dominant organ in the system. Since this is often the unit upon which

<!-- chunk -->

### folk medicine heaps the functions of the entire system, we will often

<!-- chunk -->

### denominate the entire system with the name of the organ. For instance,

<!-- chunk -->

### the stomach is the dominant organ in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thus, we may speak of the stomach as an organ system representing the

<!-- chunk -->

### upper or entire GI. Since dominant organs are often associated with the

<!-- chunk -->

### systems they personify we will often speak of “organ systems.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Before the cells were understood to be the basic building blocks of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, scientists and physicians referred to the smallest unit of living

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue as “fibers.” We often see this term in nineteenth-century literature.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have retained it and used it when it seemed appropriate to refer to the

<!-- chunk -->

### basic tissue in general, indefinite terms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Primary Organ Systems

<!-- chunk -->

### Biomedicine recognizes about eleven basic systems: circulatory,

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive, respiratory, urinary, immune, nervous, endocrine,

<!-- chunk -->

### reproductive, skeletal, muscular, and integumentary (skin, hair, nails).

<!-- chunk -->

### To a large extent, these correspond to the major functions recognized in

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional folk medicine and holistic practice. In traditional Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine there are twelve organ systems which correlate roughly with

<!-- chunk -->

### the above systems. In Western astrological medicine, there are also

<!-- chunk -->

### twelve primary functional spheres with an almost exact correspondence

<!-- chunk -->

### to Chinese medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the most important differences we notice is between the organs

<!-- chunk -->

### or organ systems that serve important functions in the body (respiration,

<!-- chunk -->

### digestion, metabolism, circulation, etc.) and those that have a primarily

<!-- chunk -->

### regulatory purpose. These I have separated as the regulatory or

<!-- chunk -->

### “guidance systems” (nervous, endocrine, hypothalamus) and “functional

<!-- chunk -->

### organ systems” (gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, liver, and so forth).

<!-- chunk -->

### We must always keep in mind the very important hierarchy of organ

<!-- chunk -->

### systems that has already been alluded to in the last chapter: defensive,

<!-- chunk -->

### functional, regulatory. The body always seeks to move disease from the

<!-- chunk -->

### vital, regulatory level to the peripheral or defensive level.

<!-- chunk -->

## Guidance Systems

<!-- chunk -->

### The body possesses two systems for sending and receiving messages. The

<!-- chunk -->

### older one, found even in single celled life forms, uses chemical signals.

<!-- chunk -->

### These are called hormones. There is a core of glands which secrete

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones to control many bodily activities. These are called the

<!-- chunk -->

### “endocrine system.” The newer method of communication uses electrical

<!-- chunk -->

### signals, that is, electron exchange. These together form the “nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system,” only found in higher (animal) forms of life. Although the

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrine and nervous systems function as separate entities with

<!-- chunk -->

### completely different structures (hormones and glands versus

<!-- chunk -->

### neurotransmitters, nerves and nerve plexi or gatherings), their work is

<!-- chunk -->

### largely integrated and overlapping. Both are directed in some measure

<!-- chunk -->

### by the hypothalamus, the “master gland” in the brain. It acts as a bridge

<!-- chunk -->

### between the two systems when there need to be signaling back and

<!-- chunk -->

### forth. It will be treated as a third guidance system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nervous System. The nervous system is separated into two major

<!-- chunk -->

### divisions, the voluntary (under conscious control) and the involuntary

<!-- chunk -->

### (instinctive reactions). The voluntary is further subdivided into the

<!-- chunk -->

### central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

<!-- chunk -->

### The former is associated with consciousness and decision making, the

<!-- chunk -->

### latter with sensation and movement. The autonomic nervous system,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is further subdivided into the sympathetic (awake, alert) and the

<!-- chunk -->

### parasympathetic (rest, digest) run involuntary functions. Danger ratchets

<!-- chunk -->

### up the sympathetic mode to the “fight or flight” level.

<!-- chunk -->

## Endocrine Core. Many organs of the body utilize hormones (chemical

<!-- chunk -->

### messengers) to send signals, but there is a core of glands which rely

<!-- chunk -->

### almost entirely on hormones to do their work: the pituitary, thyroid, and

<!-- chunk -->

### adrenals. This may be called the endocrine core. It is largely responsible

<!-- chunk -->

### for temperature, water levels, cellular and body growth, maturation, and

<!-- chunk -->

### (with the gonads) reproduction.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is misleading to speak of an “endocrine system” because many

<!-- chunk -->

### different organs use hormones to communicate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hypothalamus. This small structure in the brain lies just above the

<!-- chunk -->

### pituitary, which it continually influences and controls. A portal system

<!-- chunk -->

### (vasculature spread out into a net) allows the hypothalamus to screen

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood for indicators from the endocrine system (hormone levels). It

<!-- chunk -->

### also receives signals from the nervous system. The hypothalamus then

<!-- chunk -->

### signals the appropriate neural and endocrine centers to maintain

<!-- chunk -->

### balance.

<!-- chunk -->

### The hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary, which controls most

<!-- chunk -->

### of the endocrine core. In addition, the hypothalamus, through the

<!-- chunk -->

### autonomic nervous system, signals the peripheral “vents” of the body—

<!-- chunk -->

### sweat pores, sebaceous glands, capillaries, autonomic nerve reflexes

<!-- chunk -->

### (goose bumps, shivering) to open or close, in order to maintain thermic

<!-- chunk -->

### equilibrium. The hypothalamus maintains a “shield” to protect the

<!-- chunk -->

### deeper, internal organs from outward stress. When heat or cold assaults

<!-- chunk -->

### the body, the hypothalamus takes commensurate steps to reestablish

<!-- chunk -->

### equilibrium. If it fails, we came down with a “virus.” If it becomes

<!-- chunk -->

### permanently traumatized by environmental stress the skin will be hot,

<!-- chunk -->

### cold, closed or open, dry or damp, all very important signs of distress in

<!-- chunk -->

### the grand regulator of the body, the hypothalamus.

<!-- chunk -->

### The hypothalamus is also a part of the limbic centers regulating and

<!-- chunk -->

### controlling our emotional and subjective reactions. Thus, some of the

<!-- chunk -->

### same activities used to control peripheral defenses (blushing, flushing,

<!-- chunk -->

### pallor, shiver up the spine, etc.) are used to reinforce emotional

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions. The hypothalamus ratchets emotions up to the passionate

<!-- chunk -->

### level when there are strong emotional stimuli (life and death,

<!-- chunk -->

### procreation, love, creativity, etc.). At the same time, it attempts to

<!-- chunk -->

### maintain control over passion.

<!-- chunk -->

### The hypothalamus is a master gland that needs to be considered for

<!-- chunk -->

### comprehensive holistic care of the organism. It is the master conductor

<!-- chunk -->

### standing behind the nervous system, endocrine core, and the “febrile

<!-- chunk -->

### mechanism,” the three basic instruments of regulation in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### The regulatory or guidance systems make a unit which, with the blood,

<!-- chunk -->

### will be discussed in a separate book on the practice of traditional

<!-- chunk -->

### Western herbal medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Blood, the Universal Medium

<!-- chunk -->

### In traditional medicine the blood is considered to be a functional unit by

<!-- chunk -->

### itself. It is looked upon as a universal medium carrying food and water

<!-- chunk -->

### to all parts of the body, while carrying waste products away. The blood

<!-- chunk -->

### is the seat of the disease in and of itself (anemia, coagulation,

<!-- chunk -->

### putrefaction), or it can pick up diseases and spread them throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Blood. The blood carries food, water, and oxygen to the capillaries (the

<!-- chunk -->

### smallest vessels) to be pushed out into the internal (interstitial) fluids to

<!-- chunk -->

### supply the cells. It picks up waste products and carbon dioxide (the

<!-- chunk -->

### waste product of cellular respiration using up the oxygen) in the venules

<!-- chunk -->

### just past the capillaries. It returns the carbon dioxide to capillaries in the

<!-- chunk -->

### lungs where it is exchanged for new oxygen. The waste materials are

<!-- chunk -->

### filtered out as the blood comes through the liver and kidneys. Some

<!-- chunk -->

### waste products are picked up by the lymphatic ducts and then conveyed

<!-- chunk -->

### to the blood.

<!-- chunk -->

### The blood serum is more or less identical to the body serum or lymph

<!-- chunk -->

### in the lymphatic vessels and the interstitial fluids roaming freely

<!-- chunk -->

### between the cells. Blood proteins manufactured in the liver keep the

<!-- chunk -->

### serum from seeping out of the porous vessels. To the serum is added red

<!-- chunk -->

### blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets manufactured in the bone

<!-- chunk -->

### marrow. The former carry oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide

<!-- chunk -->

### away from them. The blood appears to be blue when it is carrying

<!-- chunk -->

### carbon dioxide, and red when it is carrying oxygen. It actuality, venous

<!-- chunk -->

### blood is dark red, but diagnostically, we look for the blue color through

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin. The white blood cells (some of which are also made in the

<!-- chunk -->

### lymphatic glands) act as a police force to patrol the inner waters of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, removing impurities. The platelets coagulate the blood to create a

<!-- chunk -->

### patch when there is a rupture in the vessels carrying the blood.

<!-- chunk -->

## Functional Organ Systems

<!-- chunk -->

### Specific organ systems carry out the functions of the body under the

<!-- chunk -->

### guidance of the neuroendocrine system. They are responsible for the

<!-- chunk -->

### basic functions of life such as respiration, circulation, digestion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination. They provide the pabulum that reaches the cells (food,

<!-- chunk -->

### water, oxygen), and process the waste materials which come away from

<!-- chunk -->

### them.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lungs/Respiration. The lungs open up to the outside world and are

<!-- chunk -->

### therefore coated with mucosa for protection. The structures of the lungs

<!-- chunk -->

### are cartilaginous and are encircled by muscles and tendons that expand

<!-- chunk -->

### and contract to allow the inhalation and exhalation of air. The fresh air

<!-- chunk -->

### fills the smallest pulmonary spaces (alveoli) so that oxygen can be taken

<!-- chunk -->

### up by red blood cells in the capillaries. They unload carbon dioxide,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is removed by exhalation. This exchange in the lungs provides for

<!-- chunk -->

### cellular respiration throughout the body. The bellows-like action of the

<!-- chunk -->

### lungs not only moves the air in and out, but also pumps the fluids of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body.

<!-- chunk -->

### The upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth, larynx, pharynx) is exposed

<!-- chunk -->

### to the outside world through several openings, and is therefore sensitive

<!-- chunk -->

### to infection. The lower respiratory tract (trachea, bronchial tubes, lungs)

<!-- chunk -->

### divides into smaller and smaller tubes, which allow the maximum

<!-- chunk -->

### amount of air to interface with the capillaries of the blood.

<!-- chunk -->

## Heart/Circulation. The heart pumps the blood throughout the body to

<!-- chunk -->

### distribute its contents (oxygen, foodstuffs) while taking away waste

<!-- chunk -->

### products (carbon dioxide, urates, etc.) Due to different tensions on the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood vessels leading to and from the heart, it must also act like a valve,

<!-- chunk -->

### adjusting the disparate tensions. Thus, the primary cause of heart disease

<!-- chunk -->

### is high blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

### The heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and sends it on to

<!-- chunk -->

### the tissues through the arterial system. It receives the spent, carbonized

<!-- chunk -->

### blood from the tissues through the veins and sends it back to the lungs.

<!-- chunk -->

### The heart beats in syncopation with the arteries; both are necessary for

<!-- chunk -->

### the movement of the blood. Part of the content of the blood (excluding

<!-- chunk -->

### the large white, red, and platelet cells) is squeezed out of the finest

<!-- chunk -->

### vessels, the capillaries, into the internal ocean of interstitial fluids, to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide food, air, and water to the cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### The circulatory system also maintains the even temperature of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body by moving cool blood out of the extremities and warm blood in, or

<!-- chunk -->

### hot blood out of the torso and head and cooler blood in. Incomplete or

<!-- chunk -->

### unbalanced circulation creates a burden on the heart.

<!-- chunk -->

## Stomach/Digestion. The upper gastrointestinal tract (lips, mouth,

<!-- chunk -->

### tongue, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum) is concerned with the

<!-- chunk -->

### breakdown of food into smaller and smaller particles, so that they can be

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed or assimilated into the body. There are two mechanisms by

<!-- chunk -->

### which this occurs: mechanical and chemical. The lips, tongue, mouth,

<!-- chunk -->

### and teeth move and grind the food to break it up. The stomach churns it,

<!-- chunk -->

### and throughout the tract it is turning, mixing, and being leavened with

<!-- chunk -->

### the chemical means of digestion: enzymes, acids, and alkalis secreted

<!-- chunk -->

### from the mucosal lining of the tract which facilitate the breakdown of

<!-- chunk -->

### substances. Problems in the digestive sphere are usually due to

<!-- chunk -->

### neuromuscular weakness, wrongs of secretion, or improper diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Small Intestine/Assimilation. The small intestine receives the jumble

<!-- chunk -->

### of broken down food particles and digestive secretions. The great length

<!-- chunk -->

### of the gut (twelve to twenty feet) allows the time for complete digestion

<!-- chunk -->

### to occur. The walls of the small intestine are studded with fixed enzymes

<!-- chunk -->

### that continue the digestive process and with brush-like hairs (villi),

<!-- chunk -->

### maximizing the spaces through which particles can be absorbed or

<!-- chunk -->

### assimilated into the organism. These spaces are in the walls of the cells

<!-- chunk -->

### lining the small intestine. Food/toxins move through several passive and

<!-- chunk -->

### active mechanisms. A large portion of immune tissue is situated in the

<!-- chunk -->

### small intestine, in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which help

<!-- chunk -->

### protect the body from foreign substances and bacteria, and the Peyer’s

<!-- chunk -->

### Patches, which protect the small intestine from impurities coming up

<!-- chunk -->

### from the large intestine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The major problems with assimilation are usually due to

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation, depression, or malnourishment in the cells lining the

<!-- chunk -->

### small intestine, or stagnation in the portal vein and lymphatics receiving

<!-- chunk -->

### the food/toxins from the gut. This results in lack of nutrition for the

<!-- chunk -->

### body or poisoning from the entry of too much toxic material through the

<!-- chunk -->

### cells lining the small intestine. Food allergies may be related to excess or

<!-- chunk -->

### deficiency in the immune and lymph component of the tract.

<!-- chunk -->

## Large Intestine/Elimination. The rough and unusable part of the

<!-- chunk -->

### digestate passes on to the large intestine, where a few last tidbits of

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition can be extracted using special means. The colon harbors

<!-- chunk -->

### bacteria that are able to break down material that the enzymes of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body cannot. Having finished this, the major function of the large

<!-- chunk -->

### intestine is to concentrate the remnant into a suitable solid mass for

<!-- chunk -->

### elimination. Water is removed until the right consistency for good stool

<!-- chunk -->

### is achieved, and the rectal sphincters, under voluntary and involuntary

<!-- chunk -->

### impulses, remove it.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lymph/Immune. The lymphatic system provides ductwork which, will

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood vessels, provides nutriment to the great internal ocean of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, the interstitial cells surrounding the cells, and takes away waste

<!-- chunk -->

### products. In biomedicine it is looked upon as a sort of minor assistant to

<!-- chunk -->

### the bloodstream, but in holistic medicine it is seen as an organ system of

<!-- chunk -->

### great importance.

<!-- chunk -->

### While fluids, food, and waste products are being transported through

<!-- chunk -->

### the blood and lymph, the immune cells (leukocytes and lymphocytes),

<!-- chunk -->

### which eat up and denature aberrant bacteria, viruses, foreign material,

<!-- chunk -->

### and cancerous cells, patrol the internal waters. The lymphatic system is

<!-- chunk -->

### the vehicle through which the immune system acts.

<!-- chunk -->

### The lymphatic system absorbs lipids and minerals from the small

<!-- chunk -->

### intestine, filtering them through ducts and glands containing immune

<!-- chunk -->

### cells (which police these materials), bringing them ultimately to the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood, then to the liver. A large amount of lymph/immune tissue is

<!-- chunk -->

### stationed in the small intestine to protect the body against infiltration of

<!-- chunk -->

### impurities and bacteria. The lymphatic system also drains and filters the

<!-- chunk -->

### water and toxins leading away from the cells, and back into the

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream. They also drain away from the surface of the body, where

<!-- chunk -->

### immune activity is needed to protect against environmental influences.

<!-- chunk -->

### The immune cells are produced in the stem cells of the red bone

<!-- chunk -->

### marrow and circulated through the blood and lymph to police the inner

<!-- chunk -->

### waters of the body. The lymph and interstitial fluids do not have their

<!-- chunk -->

### own pump, but rely on the movements of the diaphragm and the general

<!-- chunk -->

### “hum” of bodily movements.

<!-- chunk -->

### Problems in the lymphatic system are mainly due to immune over

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity or depression, and lymphatic stagnation or weakness. In

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional medicine, lymphatic and immune problems are often

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with the spleen, the largest structure in the system.

<!-- chunk -->

## Liver/Preparatory Metabolism. The rest of the nutriment in the small

<!-- chunk -->

### intestine (carbohydrates and proteins) cannot pass into the lymphatics

<!-- chunk -->

### but pass into the bloodstream. They are absorbed through cells lining the

<!-- chunk -->

### gut by more energy dependent mechanisms and are taken up by tiny

<!-- chunk -->

### capillaries that collect together into veins and are united in the portal

<!-- chunk -->

### vein, which drains all the digestive viscera. It is like a special trough for

<!-- chunk -->

### catching waste materials that flow off these hardworking, toxin-laden

<!-- chunk -->

### structures, while at the same time gathering the food/toxins from the

<!-- chunk -->

### small intestine for delivery to the liver. Indeed the toxins and foods

<!-- chunk -->

### gathered are, to some extent, indistinguishable. That is why they can be

<!-- chunk -->

### called “food/toxins.”

<!-- chunk -->

### After uniting all these veins, the portal vein begins subdividing into

<!-- chunk -->

### smaller and smaller veins which bring food/toxins into the liver for

<!-- chunk -->

### detoxification (catabolism) and rebuilding (anabolism) into foods fit for

<!-- chunk -->

### the uses of the body as blood and food proteins. The sugars are already

<!-- chunk -->

### pretty much rendered into glucose (blood sugar) when they arrive in the

<!-- chunk -->

### liver, which then decides (under direction from the pancreatic

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones) whether to store them or send them out. The lipids received

<!-- chunk -->

### from the lymphatic system are detoxified and remade into cholesterol

<!-- chunk -->

### and other lipids of use to the system.

<!-- chunk -->

### The “foodstuffs” prepared by the liver are collected into veins draining

<!-- chunk -->

### the liver, sent to the heart and pumped through the arteries to the

<!-- chunk -->

### capillaries, where they cross the barrier and enter the interstitial fluids,

<!-- chunk -->

### there to be picked up by the cells of the body. The cells finish the

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism of these substances, which have been prepared by the liver,

<!-- chunk -->

### hence the liver is in charge of “preparatory metabolism.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The active unit of the liver is the hepatic lobule. The portal veins feed

<!-- chunk -->

### into the lobules, along with an artery supplying red blood for nutrition

<!-- chunk -->

### of the liver cells themselves, a biliary duct to drain off bile (a byproduct

<!-- chunk -->

### of metabolism) and a vein to drain away carbonized blood and newly

<!-- chunk -->

### minted foodstuffs. The net of the portal vein provides the basic structure

<!-- chunk -->

### for the liver.

<!-- chunk -->

## Gall Bladder/Bile Regulation. The liver manufactures bile as a

<!-- chunk -->

### byproduct and a waste product. The gall ducts receives the bile, collects

<!-- chunk -->

### it together into larger ducts, saves some in the gall sac or bladder and

<!-- chunk -->

### secretes some, as needed, into the common bile duct and thence into the

<!-- chunk -->

### small intestine. The function of the bile is to emulsify or break down fats

<!-- chunk -->

### and oils in the gut. Much of it is reabsorbed through the walls of the

<!-- chunk -->

### intestines and brought back to the liver, but some of it is passed with the

<!-- chunk -->

### stool, which it lubricates and turns brown. Without bile, the stool would

<!-- chunk -->

### be a gray color.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pancreas/Digestive and Metabolic Assistant. A signal from the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach prompts the pancreas to dump digestive enzymes mixed in an

<!-- chunk -->

### alkaline solution into the common bile duct, where it joins the bile and

<!-- chunk -->

### exits into the duodenum, to act on the digestate. The carbohydrates are

<!-- chunk -->

### thus broken down into glucose, the proteins into amino acids, the lipids

<!-- chunk -->

### into short fatty acid chains, and the minerals freed for absorption.

<!-- chunk -->

### The pancreas also secretes insulin during feeding to help the cells pick

<!-- chunk -->

### up glucose (blood sugar) and proteins. Some of this is stored in the cells

<!-- chunk -->

### for later use as glycogen. During fasting (between meals) it secretes

<!-- chunk -->

### glucagon which helps the liver and cells mobilize stored blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### (glycogen) back into usable blood sugar (glucose). Thus, the pancreas

<!-- chunk -->

### keeps up a continuous level of blood sugar for the tissues, which use it

<!-- chunk -->

### continuously as a fuel. No internal organ is as sensitive to food as the

<!-- chunk -->

### pancreas.

<!-- chunk -->

## Kidneys/Water and Solid Regulation. The kidneys remove waste

<!-- chunk -->

### products from the interior of the body. The large intestine, by

<!-- chunk -->

### comparison, removes wastes from the alimentary tube; these have never

<!-- chunk -->

### truly been inside the body. However, the kidneys retain much more than

<!-- chunk -->

### they remove. While in one sense they are eliminative organs, in another

<!-- chunk -->

### they are filters that measure and balance the internal fluids and solids of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Arteries feed red blood into the kidneys, where it is split up into little

<!-- chunk -->

### capillaries. A major part of the plasma and its contents are arbitrarily

<!-- chunk -->

### absorbed across the capillary wall into the tubules of the kidneys. The

<!-- chunk -->

### capillaries continue to nestle around the tubules and there is a

<!-- chunk -->

### continuous exchange, back and forth, until the waste products and some

<!-- chunk -->

### water necessary for their elimination are left in the tubules while the

<!-- chunk -->

### minerals and nutrients useful to the body are retained in the

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream. This shuffling back and forth is regulated primarily by

<!-- chunk -->

### aldosterone hormone from the adrenal cortex (excrete more) and

<!-- chunk -->

### vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) from the posterior pituitary (retain

<!-- chunk -->

### more). Finally, a small amount of waste material (urates from protein

<!-- chunk -->

### breakdown, some extra minerals, and a few aberrant toxic chemicals),

<!-- chunk -->

### with enough water to remove them, are expelled into the pelvis of the

<!-- chunk -->

### kidney, a large collection area, and are excreted through the ureters as

<!-- chunk -->

### urine, and into the bladder.

<!-- chunk -->

### The kidneys also screen the blood to determine if there is enough

<!-- chunk -->

### oxygen; if not, they signal the stem cells in the bone marrow to produce

<!-- chunk -->

### more red blood cells. The stem cells can be stimulated by different

<!-- chunk -->

### signals to produce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, as well

<!-- chunk -->

### as “replacement parts” for many different organs of the body. The

<!-- chunk -->

### triggers for these mechanisms are unknown, but it seems likely that they

<!-- chunk -->

### are in the kidneys, or related to them through feedback loops. The

<!-- chunk -->

### kidneys also maintain blood pressure.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bladder/Water and Solid Elimination. The ureters bring the urine

<!-- chunk -->

### from the kidneys to the bladder, which acts like a holding tank,

<!-- chunk -->

### collecting it until there is enough of it to dispose. The bladder is a

<!-- chunk -->

### mucosa-lined sac that is emptied by powerful muscles under a

<!-- chunk -->

### combination of voluntary and involuntary neuromuscular impulses. The

<!-- chunk -->

### urine is pushed out through the urethra. Since the bladder, like the lungs

<!-- chunk -->

### and gastrointestinal tract, is open to the outside world, it is lined by

<!-- chunk -->

### mucosa and is susceptible to external bacterial infections.

<!-- chunk -->

## Special Systems

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to the above, there are several major systems which are

<!-- chunk -->

### complex because they are composed of many different tissues and

<!-- chunk -->

### organs, or because other major organ systems manifest through them.

<!-- chunk -->

## Reproductive System. The reproductive system of female and male

<!-- chunk -->

### contains specialized structures and hormone regulatory mechanisms. The

<!-- chunk -->

### female tract is particularly complicated and, as it is more readily open to

<!-- chunk -->

### the external world and to the rigors of childbearing and lactation, more

<!-- chunk -->

### easily disordered. Thus, great attention is paid to the female tract in

<!-- chunk -->

### biomedicine and herbal medicine. The male system tends to be less often

<!-- chunk -->

### disordered, though impotence and enlargement of the prostate is a

<!-- chunk -->

### common event of older age.

<!-- chunk -->

## Muscular and Skeletal System. This organ system operates as a unit,

<!-- chunk -->

### but is composed of many different structures, including muscles, nerves,

<!-- chunk -->

### cartilage, bones, tendons, complex joints, cerebrospinal fluid, circulatory

<!-- chunk -->

### vessels, and epithelial linings (bursa). In order to treat muscular and

<!-- chunk -->

### skeletal system problems effectively, it is usually necessary to attend to

<!-- chunk -->

### each component individually, as well as the whole.

<!-- chunk -->

## Skin. The hair, nails, and skin represent the “integumentary system,”

<!-- chunk -->

### which is composed particularly of connective tissue and functions at the

<!-- chunk -->

### exterior of the body. Often, if one of these structures is weak so are the

<!-- chunk -->

### others. The skin is particularly complex because it not only has its own

<!-- chunk -->

### problems (closed sweat pores, sebaceous glands, poor wound healing,

<!-- chunk -->

### etc.), it acts as an eliminative channel. In a healthy state, it secretes

<!-- chunk -->

### water and some salts. If the pores become clogged for some reason, a

<!-- chunk -->

### burden is thrown on the other channels of elimination —particularly, the

<!-- chunk -->

### kidneys, colon, and lungs. The reverse is also true. Closure of one of

<!-- chunk -->

### these three channels often causes problems in the skin as toxins try to

<!-- chunk -->

### make their way out.

<!-- chunk -->

### In traditional medicine the major organ systems are closely associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with certain emotions or psychological faculties. It is interesting to note

<!-- chunk -->

### that in both Eastern and Western medicine theory, the liver is associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with anger and the spleen with melancholy. These correspondences are

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes very useful and at other times not. Since we will not be going

<!-- chunk -->

### over the organ systems in this book, we will omit this information for

<!-- chunk -->

### now.

<!-- chunk -->

## Interactions Between Organ Systems

<!-- chunk -->

### It would be convenient if disease started in a specific location and stayed

<!-- chunk -->

### there, but in reality disease moves across the boundaries of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Usually, an imbalance will spread from one functional unit into others as

<!-- chunk -->

### healthy functional units try to compensate for weaknesses. If the nose is

<!-- chunk -->

### plugged, the patient will breath through the mouth. If the respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### tract is subject to chronic infection, the lymphatic system will

<!-- chunk -->

### compensate by carrying away waste materials. If the thyroid is secreting

<!-- chunk -->

### low levels of thyroxin, the pituitary will secrete higher levels of TSH

<!-- chunk -->

### (thyroid stimulating hormone). After a while, overtaxed organs and

<!-- chunk -->

### systems can no longer compensate for serious functional imbalance and

<!-- chunk -->

### the disturbance will move from a functional level to a condition of tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### breakdown. Here, at last, the material lesion may appear and the

<!-- chunk -->

### disturbance generally enters the radar screen of modern biomedicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The usual biomedical approach is to compensate for the incapacity of

<!-- chunk -->

### the body by introducing a drug that makes the body do what it is

<!-- chunk -->

### supposed to do. The holistic approach is different. Instead of trying to

<!-- chunk -->

### force the body to operate as we want it to, we try to return it to a state

<!-- chunk -->

### of health where it can take care of itself. In reality, biomedicine does not

<!-- chunk -->

### believe in healing, but in pain and disease “management.” There are

<!-- chunk -->

### cures, however, and laws of cure. Of course, as the situation deteriorates,

<!-- chunk -->

### it reaches a level where the organism cannot heal itself, and drugs or

<!-- chunk -->

### surgical intervention are necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### When we approach disease from the holistic angle we use medicines

<!-- chunk -->

### differently from how they are used in biomedicine. Instead of forcing the

<!-- chunk -->

### body to operate in a certain fashion, we want to stimulate or sedate, feed

<!-- chunk -->

### or cleanse, to allow organs and systems to return to healthy operation.

<!-- chunk -->

### This is the way medicine plants have always been used around the

<!-- chunk -->

### world. There are relatively few herbs that can force the body to do

<!-- chunk -->

### anything; most of them mildly increase or decrease functional activity.

<!-- chunk -->

### One modern fad attempts to use herbs like drugs to suppress an

<!-- chunk -->

### imbalance. It may be possible to practice herbalism by imitating modern

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine (though I have yet to see this proven as a comprehensive

<!-- chunk -->

### system), but this should not be mistaken for holistic treatment. It is not

<!-- chunk -->

### curative. It is more suppression and management.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another idea is that herbs are nutritional substances that feed the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism. This may be true, but it tends to confuse a real difference

<!-- chunk -->

### between herbs and foods. As Hippocrates observed, foods cure by being

<!-- chunk -->

### blander than herbs, which cure by virtue of their acid, acrid, bitter,

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent, or pungent taste.

<!-- chunk -->

### As far as herbs are concerned, they are neither drugs nor nutritional

<!-- chunk -->

### supplements, but something else which has not been recognized or

<!-- chunk -->

### defined by modern science. Medicinal plants are powers or forces which

<!-- chunk -->

### act on the body in a milder fashion than drugs, but in a stronger fashion

<!-- chunk -->

### than foods. They do not force, but “exercise” functions in the body by

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing or decreasing the level of activity, tension, and hydration.

<!-- chunk -->

## Medicinal Organ Affinities

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbs are often classified according to their affinity to act on a certain

<!-- chunk -->

### organ. As herbalist David Hoffman pointed out to me in conversation, if

<!-- chunk -->

### poisons can be classified according to their affinities for certain

<!-- chunk -->

### structures, than herbs can be classified in this manner just as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### Galenic medicine classified herbs according to their “appropriations,”

<!-- chunk -->

### i.e., the organ that picked up or appropriated them. Paracelsus, who

<!-- chunk -->

### rejected so much of the Greek system, saw fit to continue this concept.

<!-- chunk -->

### The appropriata were thus defined down to the era of Nicholas Culpeper

<!-- chunk -->

### and William Salmon.

<!-- chunk -->

### In the early nineteenth century, Dr. Johann Gottfried Rademacher

<!-- chunk -->

### (1772–1850), a Saxon physician influenced by Paracelsus, developed a

<!-- chunk -->

### system of practice based primarily on the affinities of different medicines

<!-- chunk -->

### to organs. Rademacher did not give this system a particular name but his

<!-- chunk -->

### followers called it “organopathy” and his medicines were called “organ

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies.”

<!-- chunk -->

### British herbalist Grahme Tobyn pointed out to me that Galen and

<!-- chunk -->

### Paracelsus conceived of the organ as “appropriating” the remedy, while

<!-- chunk -->

### Rademacher saw the remedy having an “affinity” to the organ. As I first

<!-- chunk -->

### studied in the school of Rademacher—via Compton Burnett (see below)

<!-- chunk -->

### —I use the terminology of affinity, without, however, rejecting the idea

<!-- chunk -->

### of appropriation. An attraction between an herb and its target is

<!-- chunk -->

### probably mutual, but the language often does not express this idea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although he was not a homeopath, Rademacher adopted the doctrine

<!-- chunk -->

### of dilution of dosage. He found that the more specific his diagnosis and

<!-- chunk -->

### prescription, the less he needed of the remedy. He went as far as a

<!-- chunk -->

### dilution of one drop of the mother tincture in a half-cup of water. At

<!-- chunk -->

### other times he used the larger doses (ten to thirty drops), as experience

<!-- chunk -->

### taught him. Should anyone think he was copying Samuel Hahnemann,

<!-- chunk -->

### Rademacher pointed out that Paracelsus advocated dilution.

<!-- chunk -->

### An English homeopath, Dr. James Compton Burnett (1849–1900)

<!-- chunk -->

### rescued Rademacher’s organopathy from obscurity. Like Rademacher,

<!-- chunk -->

### Burnett used herbal remedies according to organ affinities, in small

<!-- chunk -->

### material doses. He refined the principles governing the selection of

<!-- chunk -->

### organ specific medicines. Burnett observed that they possessed three

<!-- chunk -->

### basic characteristics:

<!-- chunk -->

## Kind of action. The remedy has a specific kind of action on that tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Juniper berries are not just diuretic, but more specifically, an “irritating

<!-- chunk -->

### diuretic” (i.e., a stimulant). Therefore they are contraindicated in acute

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation of the kidneys but may be remedial in chronic depression

<!-- chunk -->

### of kidney function with edema.

<!-- chunk -->

## Seat of action. The remedy has a specific affinity to a particular tissue,

<!-- chunk -->

### organ, or function. Juniperus is a well-known diuretic with an affinity to

<!-- chunk -->

### the kidney, while Crataegus has a well known action on the heart.

<!-- chunk -->

## Range of action. The remedy may be curative to the seat and kind of

<!-- chunk -->

### action of the disease, but its range of action may be limited. For

<!-- chunk -->

### instance, Melissa may cure heat and irritation of the stomach due to

<!-- chunk -->

### nervousness, but it will not cure it when due to a general metabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive stimulation of the stomach. Goldenseal may cure gastric

<!-- chunk -->

### ulceration but it will seldom cure cancer of the stomach. When a remedy

<!-- chunk -->

### has reached its limit of action, it comes to what Burnett called its “stop-

<!-- chunk -->

### spot.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Organ affinities are not so easily determined. They are very much the

<!-- chunk -->

### product of experience, and this is random and incomplete by nature.

<!-- chunk -->

### Burnett addressed this problem by adopting a technique from

<!-- chunk -->

### Rademacher that he called “organ-testing.” If the physician was certain

<!-- chunk -->

### of the seat of the disease, but uncertain of the exact remedy to be used,

<!-- chunk -->

### he gave a series of medicines with affinities to that organ, until the right

<!-- chunk -->

### one hit home. This procedure may seem rather crude, but it works, as I

<!-- chunk -->

### have learned from experience. It also requires a considerable knowledge

<!-- chunk -->

### of the organ affinities of remedies. “This organ-testing I have found of

<!-- chunk -->

### great importance in practice,” writes Burnett in Greater Diseases of the

<!-- chunk -->

### Liver (1891, 76). “But it cannot be utilized unless one is well acquainted

<!-- chunk -->

### with the organ-remedies, that is to say, with the local electivity of

<!-- chunk -->

### drugs.”

<!-- chunk -->

### I do not know exactly how Burnett tested his organ remedies; one is

<!-- chunk -->

### left to suppose that he gave one after another, week after week, as the

<!-- chunk -->

### patient returned to his office. This does not seem very effective. My own

<!-- chunk -->

### method of “organ-testing” is to give a dose of the herb on the wrist, one

<!-- chunk -->

### herb after another, until I feel the pulse change. If it is too fast, it slows

<!-- chunk -->

### down; if too tense, it relaxes.

<!-- chunk -->

### Burnett also recognized that some local organ diseases arise from

<!-- chunk -->

### general causes in the organism, not just local causes. These require

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment by constitutional medicines. To cure these conditions he used

<!-- chunk -->

### the homeopathic constitutional remedies and nosodes (remedies made

<!-- chunk -->

### from disease organisms).

<!-- chunk -->

### Burnett found that the organ-remedies worked better in small material

<!-- chunk -->

### doses (about one to twenty-five drops) repeated daily. In this, he was

<!-- chunk -->

### following both Paracelsus and Rademacher. The constitutional remedies

<!-- chunk -->

### he used in homeopathic doses, infrequently repeated.

<!-- chunk -->

### The early devotees of hormonal supplementation adopted the term

<!-- chunk -->

### “organopathy,” late in the nineteenth century. They were not aware of,

<!-- chunk -->

### or did not care, about the earlier usage. They used extracts of the

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrine glands of animals to treat disorder in the corresponding gland

<!-- chunk -->

### of the human. Some of this therapy must be seen as supplementation,

<!-- chunk -->

### while some of it seems to have stimulated self-healing in the organism.

<!-- chunk -->

### An example of this literature is Dr. Henry Harrower’s Pluriglandular

<!-- chunk -->

### Therapy (1928). I used this little book to help me understand patterns in

<!-- chunk -->

### hormonal excesses and deficiencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### In my own practice I adhere rather closely to the teachings of

<!-- chunk -->

### Rademacher and Burnett, using small doses of the herbal tincture. I also

<!-- chunk -->

### follow the teachings of Dr. John M. Scudder who, like Rademacher and

<!-- chunk -->

### Paracelsus, used small doses of the herb. The more specific the medicine,

<!-- chunk -->

### the less needed, because a specific medicine is so well adapted to the

<!-- chunk -->

### organism or the imbalance it is treating. For a further discussion of

<!-- chunk -->

### specific medicine and organ specific medicine, please refer to my book

<!-- chunk -->

### Vitalism: The History of Herbalism, Homeopathy, and Flower Essences

<!-- chunk -->

### (1992).


<!-- chunk -->

### In any attempt to study living forms some system of classification is

<!-- chunk -->

### necessary.

<!-- chunk -->

### Heretofore most students of Man have used an arbitrary division

<!-- chunk -->

### based on two basic types—the long thins and short thicks.

### he six tissue states constitute a system for describing pathology.

<!-- chunk -->

### By comparison, when we speak of a person’s constitution we are

<!-- chunk -->

### referring to the predisposing strengths and weaknesses of the

<!-- chunk -->

### entire organism. Often the two are related, i.e., a hot person will have

<!-- chunk -->

### hot diseases, but we also see manifestations of disease which are out of

<!-- chunk -->

### character with the constitution. It is often a good idea to understand the

<!-- chunk -->

### disease pattern, the tissue state, and the constitution, in order to grasp

<!-- chunk -->

### the entire picture.

<!-- chunk -->

## Three Primary Constitutions

<!-- chunk -->

### The word constitution is derived from a Latin root referring to the basic

<!-- chunk -->

### “constituents” in a system. An older term would be temperament. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### derived from the root tempero, referring to the temper or mixture of

<!-- chunk -->

### different constituent elements into a whole organism. Well-proportioned

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds are well-tempered.

<!-- chunk -->

### Closely related to constitution and temperament is the study of

<!-- chunk -->

### physiognomy, or the shape of the face and body. Various structures and

<!-- chunk -->

### shapes are associated with different psychological, or physical

<!-- chunk -->

### predispositions, or constitutional elements in a person. Physiognomic

<!-- chunk -->

### study is found in all traditional cultures. Several doctors (William

<!-- chunk -->

### Sheldon, George Draper) undertook extensive statistical studies on

<!-- chunk -->

### physiognomy in the early twentieth century which have never been

<!-- chunk -->

### impeached, though they are ignored by modern biomedicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The ancient Greeks introduced a basic system of four humors or

<!-- chunk -->

### primal substances in the body (phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black

<!-- chunk -->

### bile). There were thus four temperaments, in which one of these

<!-- chunk -->

### substances predominated: the phlegmatic, sanguine, choleric, or

<!-- chunk -->

### melancholic. This approach remained frozen in tradition until the

<!-- chunk -->

### seventeenth century, when Greek medicine began to break down.

<!-- chunk -->

### Various temperaments were added or subtracted over the next two

<!-- chunk -->

### centuries. Eventually, the old approach was dropped in favor of a more

<!-- chunk -->

### practical approach (thin, medium, thick). Interestingly, this change

<!-- chunk -->

### occurred in both alternative and conventional medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Alternative practitioners in nineteenth-century America settled upon a

<!-- chunk -->

### system of three basic constitutions corresponding to the three general

<!-- chunk -->

### classes of organs. They called these the mental, motive, and vital types,

<!-- chunk -->

### corresponding to the nervous system, the muscular/skeletal system, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the visceral organs. An early proponent of this system was Dr. D. H.

<!-- chunk -->

### Jacques (1878).

<!-- chunk -->

### In the early twentieth century Western doctors adopted a

<!-- chunk -->

### constitutional system based on thin and thick. The former was called the

<!-- chunk -->

### asthenic type, the latter the esthenic, plethoric, or pyknic type. (Evidently

<!-- chunk -->

### they did not want their terms to become part of everyday language). The

<!-- chunk -->

### leader of this innovation was Dr. Kretchmer, in Germany, and these

<!-- chunk -->

### terms are still used in German medicine. Dr. George Draper was a major

<!-- chunk -->

### American proponent of this system. Dr. William Sheldon developed a

<!-- chunk -->

### system based on three types, thin, medium, and thick, or ectomorph,

<!-- chunk -->

### mesomorph, and endomorph. These terms are still used in non-medical

<!-- chunk -->

### conversation. Michio Kushi uses a modified form of this system in

<!-- chunk -->

### macrobiotic diagnosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### Today, many of these ideas and concepts have been forgotten.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, Western students of constitution have gravitated to the same

<!-- chunk -->

### tripartite system, adopting the Ayurvedic doshas: vata, pitta, and kapha.

<!-- chunk -->

### These correspond respectively to thin, medium, and thick. It should

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps not be surprising that the same ideas again prevail. As Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### George Draper (1928, 9) observed about the constitutions thick and thin,

<!-- chunk -->

### “having started to study the personality differences between members of

<!-- chunk -->

### various disease groups, we have come out at precisely the same point in

<!-- chunk -->

### classification of types as have all other observers of mankind.” There is

<!-- chunk -->

### also the medium, which has its own problems. All these systems lie in

<!-- chunk -->

### beautiful and almost perfect alignment. Thus, we get to learn from

<!-- chunk -->

### several different approaches, incorporating insights from ancient and

<!-- chunk -->

### modern studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The threefold system is based upon the “three classes of organs,” to

<!-- chunk -->

### use the nineteenth-century expression, or the “three layers of the

<!-- chunk -->

### embryo,” to use Sheldon’s. This ties constitution to the organs, helping

<!-- chunk -->

### us to see otherwise hidden connections.

<!-- chunk -->

## Western Physiognomy

<!-- chunk -->

### The Fowler brothers were phrenologists interested in the nature and

<!-- chunk -->

### interpretation of character. Dr. D. H. Jacques brought their ideas into the

<!-- chunk -->

### medical arena. His posthumous work, The Temperaments (1878), gives us

<!-- chunk -->

### basic descriptions of the three primal types which are quoted below. For

<!-- chunk -->

### the sake of clarity, I have used the term “visceral” instead of “vital.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The three types, according to both alternative and conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors were defined as follow:

<!-- chunk -->

## Nervous. The nineteenth-century Western doctors and phrenologists

<!-- chunk -->

### called this the mental type. Nervous seems better suited to the modern

<!-- chunk -->

### ear. This is the vata type of Ayurveda.

<!-- chunk -->

### According to Jacques, “the Mental Temperament is characterized

<!-- chunk -->

### physically by a frame relatively slight, and a head relatively large; an

<!-- chunk -->

### oval face; a high, pale forehead, broadest at the top; delicately cut if not

<!-- chunk -->

### sharp features; an expressive countenance; a delicate, transparent skin;

<!-- chunk -->

### fine, soft hair, generally light in color and not abundant; brilliant,

<!-- chunk -->

### speaking eyes, generally gray or hazel, and quick in their movements;

<!-- chunk -->

### and a high-keyed, flexible voice. The figure is often elegant and graceful,

<!-- chunk -->

### but seldom striking or commanding. The muscles are small, but well

<!-- chunk -->

### formed, and adapted to rapid action, rather than to strength. Fineness

<!-- chunk -->

### and delicacy characterize the whole structure; but there is not

<!-- chunk -->

### necessarily any lack of real stamina, as the healthiness and longevity of

<!-- chunk -->

### persons of this constitution (when it be not subjected to great abuse)

<!-- chunk -->

### abundantly show.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Mentally this temperament indicates activity of the brain, acuteness

<!-- chunk -->

### of the senses, and intensity of emotion.” In the positive expression, these

<!-- chunk -->

### people are intelligent, literary, and sensitive. In the negative, the

<!-- chunk -->

### constitution “is characterized by the smallness and emaciation of the

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles, the quickness and intensity of the sensations, the suddenness

<!-- chunk -->

### and fickleness of the determinations, and a morbid impressibility.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Motive. This is the pitta type of Ayurveda. “In the person of this

<!-- chunk -->

### temperament, firmness of texture characterizes all the organs, imparting

<!-- chunk -->

### great strength and endurance, with an almost unlimited capacity for

<!-- chunk -->

### both mental and bodily labor. There is never much superfluous flesh

<!-- chunk -->

### where the Motive temperament is strongly predominant, and there is

<!-- chunk -->

### often more or less hollowness of cheeks, giving additional ruggedness to

<!-- chunk -->

### the features.”

<!-- chunk -->

### In these people, the bones, muscles, and tendons are emphasized.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Bones proportionally large, and long rather than broad; strong, hard

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles, and prominent articulations, give to the outlines of the form in

<!-- chunk -->

### the Motive temperament a tendency to angularity and sharpness. The

<!-- chunk -->

### figure is commonly tall and striking, if not elegant; the chest moderate in

<!-- chunk -->

### size and fullness; the shoulders broad and definite; the abdomen

<!-- chunk -->

### proportional; the limbs long and only moderately tapering. The face is

<!-- chunk -->

### oblong; the check bones rather high …; the front teeth large; and the

<!-- chunk -->

### features generally prominent and sharply defined. The expression of the

<!-- chunk -->

### countenance is striking, grave, earnest, determined, and sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### severe and stern.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Political agitations, revolutionary movements, heated religious

<!-- chunk -->

### controversies, opposition in all forms, constant resistance to authority or

<!-- chunk -->

### the will of others, and the necessity for being always watchful and on

<!-- chunk -->

### the defensive, are amongst the strongest of these influences” which build

<!-- chunk -->

### this constitution, as well as “the exercise of authority, especially in

<!-- chunk -->

### military forms, and the weight of great responsibilities.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Visceral. The emphasis is on the “vital” or visceral organs associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with digestion and nutrition. This produces a large type. According to

<!-- chunk -->

### Jacques, the “Vital temperament is characterized, physically, by a

<!-- chunk -->

### stature above the medium, and marked by a breadth and thickness of

<!-- chunk -->

### body proportionally greater, and a size of limbs proportionally less than

<!-- chunk -->

### in the Motive temperament. The chest is full, the abdomen well

<!-- chunk -->

### developed, the limbs plump, but tapering, and terminating in hands and

<!-- chunk -->

### feet relatively small. The neck is short and thick, the shoulders broad

<!-- chunk -->

### and well founded, and the head and face, corresponding with the other

<!-- chunk -->

### parts of the system, incline to roundness. The expression of the

<!-- chunk -->

### countenance is generally lively, pleasing, frank, benevolent, and often

<!-- chunk -->

### mirthful. The pose of the body and its movements are natural, easy,

<!-- chunk -->

### graceful, and dignified. The pulse is quicker than in the Motive

<!-- chunk -->

### temperament, and the organization throughout betokens vigor, warmth,

<!-- chunk -->

### and activity. The cheeks flush readily with exercise or emotion, and all

<!-- chunk -->

### the senses are active, acute, and refined.”

<!-- chunk -->

### “An undue preponderance of the absorbent system [the mesenteric

<!-- chunk -->

### lymphatics], conjoined with a sluggish action of the heart and lungs,

<!-- chunk -->

### give rise to an abnormal deposit of watery fluids under the skin,

<!-- chunk -->

### producing additional fullness, and presenting softer and more rounded

<!-- chunk -->

### contours than even those properly belonging to this constitution, but

<!-- chunk -->

### lacking their well-defined and graceful outlines.” This condition, “when

<!-- chunk -->

### fully developed, constitutes the Lymphatic temperament” or phlegmatic

<!-- chunk -->

### constitution of Greek medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ayurvedic Tridosha

<!-- chunk -->

### Vedic philosophy recognizes five basic elements, the same earth, air,

<!-- chunk -->

### fire, and water of the Western/Greek system, plus the additional element

<!-- chunk -->

### of ether, which changes and directs the others (the so-called “fifth

<!-- chunk -->

### element” of Western philosophy). However, it is the three doshas that are

<!-- chunk -->

### primarily used in medical typology: vata, pitta, and kapha. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### considered to be derivatives of the five elements.

<!-- chunk -->

### The word dosha means “that which darkens, or decays.” Thus, the

<!-- chunk -->

### three doshas are looked upon as the substances that cause disease. The

<!-- chunk -->

### tridosha system, therefore, is essentially pathological, rather than

<!-- chunk -->

### “anatomical.” It describes three pathological tendencies. This contrasts

<!-- chunk -->

### with the approach of Fowler, the nineteenth-century physiognomists and

<!-- chunk -->

### the twentieth-century physicians. Their approach was “anatomical”

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than pathological. Thus, a comparison of systems will enrich our

<!-- chunk -->

### understanding of the three basic constitutional types. It is well to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the constitution in both health and disease. For a

<!-- chunk -->

### comprehensive treatment of the three doshas in relationship to modern

<!-- chunk -->

### health see Rudolph Ballentine’s Radical Healing (1999).

<!-- chunk -->

## Vata. The tendency of this dosha is to dry out. People of this constitution

<!-- chunk -->

### therefore tend to be lean, dry, and concentrated in color, or dark. Their

<!-- chunk -->

### musculature is lean or under developed. The joints, muscles, tendons,

<!-- chunk -->

### and veins are visible through the skin. The eyes, hair, nails, and skin

<!-- chunk -->

### tend to be dry and lusterless. Perspiration and urine are scanty, feces dry

<!-- chunk -->

### and hard. The personality is active, restless, alert, sometimes to the point

<!-- chunk -->

### of sleeplessness, nervousness, fearfulness, and anxiety. They are mentally

<!-- chunk -->

### searching but changeable and lacking in confidence. They like the fields

<!-- chunk -->

### of scholarship, discovery, and communication.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pitta. The tendency of this dosha is to heat up and burn. The

<!-- chunk -->

### constitution is medium in build, sitting midway between the leanness of

<!-- chunk -->

### vata and the heaviness of kapha. Pitta people are emotionally fiery and

<!-- chunk -->

### physically hot. They tend to have a strong appetite, digestion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism. They like to eat large quantities of food and beverage,

<!-- chunk -->

### which their system handles well. The body temperature tends to be a

<!-- chunk -->

### little warm and the extremities are usually warm. Their system throws

<!-- chunk -->

### off a moderate to large amount of perspiration and urine. The skin tends

<!-- chunk -->

### to be nicely warm and moist. The complexion tends to be fair, red, or

<!-- chunk -->

### yellow. Thirst may be excessive. They are intelligent and quick-witted,

<!-- chunk -->

### with good comprehension. They can be ardent, aggressive, irritable,

<!-- chunk -->

### jealous. Their speech may be sharp and cutting. They are sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### good orators and, with their natural ambition, sometimes assume roles

<!-- chunk -->

### of leadership.

<!-- chunk -->

## Kapha. This dosha tends to get waterlogged, heavy, and cold. The

<!-- chunk -->

### features are more rounded than in the previous constitutions, because of

<!-- chunk -->

### the thickness of the tissues. The complexion tends to be light, the hair

<!-- chunk -->

### thick, dark, lustrous, and well nourished, the skin soft and oily, but

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes pale, moist, and cold. The eyes may be glowing and

<!-- chunk -->

### magnetic. Internal functions tend to be slow and ponderous, so that

<!-- chunk -->

### digestion is sluggish, the stool is sometimes soft and poorly rid of, the

<!-- chunk -->

### perspiration and urine of moderate amount and sometimes retained.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thinking processes are slow, but more profound, and conclusions more

<!-- chunk -->

### enduring. Once they comprehend a fact they retain it well. They are

<!-- chunk -->

### emotionally more sensitive and subtle. Physically, they like ease,

<!-- chunk -->

### pleasure, and luxury, and tend to collect goods around them.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sheldon’s Three Types

<!-- chunk -->

### In the 1940s, psychologist and physician William Sheldon began to

<!-- chunk -->

### develop a system of body types based on scientific research. The model

<!-- chunk -->

### he came up with also has three types that are thin, medium, and thick in

<!-- chunk -->

### build. Each somatotype had its own peculiar psychological, physical, and

<!-- chunk -->

### medical tendencies, which he determined through statistical studies.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sheldon went a step further and speculated that the three types were

<!-- chunk -->

### derived from a preponderance, during embryological development, of

<!-- chunk -->

### one of the three layers of tissue in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm,

<!-- chunk -->

### or endoderm (meaning the outer, middle, and inner developmental

<!-- chunk -->

### layers). Thus, he named his three types the ectomorph, mesomorph, and

<!-- chunk -->

### endomorph.

<!-- chunk -->

### It turns out that there is a striking correlation between Sheldon’s work

<!-- chunk -->

### and the earlier, physiognomic model, not only with regard to the three

<!-- chunk -->

### constitutional types, but also in regard to the three classes of organs

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with each type. The groupings developed by the earlier,

<!-- chunk -->

### intuitive researchers, correspond exactly with the organs and systems

<!-- chunk -->

### which develop out of the three embryological layers. Remarkably, the

<!-- chunk -->

### earlier researchers had no knowledge of embryological science. Thus, the

<!-- chunk -->

### endoderm develops into the digestive tract, including pancreas, liver,

<!-- chunk -->

### and gall bladder; the respiratory system; and the bladder. The mesoderm

<!-- chunk -->

### evolves into the muscular and skeletal system; the circulatory system

<!-- chunk -->

### (heart and vasculature); and the kidneys and adrenals. The ectoderm

<!-- chunk -->

### gives rise to the nervous system, the sensorium, and the skin through

<!-- chunk -->

### which the nerves and senses operate so strongly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ectomorph. The ectoderm develops into the outer layers of the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### including the skin and the sensory nervous system. Thus, ectomorphs are

<!-- chunk -->

### directly exposed to the world, making them oversensitive, nervous, and

<!-- chunk -->

### overexposed. They tend to set up ideals that protect them from direct

<!-- chunk -->

### emotional interaction, because they are too sensitive and are constantly

<!-- chunk -->

### being pushed out of balance. They have erratic habits in eating, sleeping,

<!-- chunk -->

### and living. They tend to be easily disturbed and are more vulnerable to

<!-- chunk -->

### sickness than the other types. They tend to strong reactions, emotions,

<!-- chunk -->

### thoughts, and opinions, which can be expressed suddenly and

<!-- chunk -->

### surprisingly, for they keep to themselves for self-protection and

<!-- chunk -->

### contemplation. They have a hard time dealing with these strong

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions, with feelings, sexuality, and other people.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mesomorph. This constitution develops out of the mesoderm, which

<!-- chunk -->

### creates the muscular and skeletal, cardiovascular, and renal systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are thus powerful, agile, well built, athletic, strong, and

<!-- chunk -->

### charismatic. They have a medium build between the other two types.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mesomorphs thrive on action, taking an active role in the world and

<!-- chunk -->

### attempting to have more impact than others do. They tend to exude a

<!-- chunk -->

### feeling of confidence, energy, and optimism, so that others are drawn to

<!-- chunk -->

### them as leaders. They are naturally healthy, but so driven that they can

<!-- chunk -->

### create problems for themselves through injuries and tension. They have

<!-- chunk -->

### a hot arterial system and tendencies to coronary problems. Because of

<!-- chunk -->

### their external orientation, they tend to become isolated from their own

<!-- chunk -->

### internal life, and to be less sensitive to those with whom they have

<!-- chunk -->

### friendships and relationships. This gets them into situations where they

<!-- chunk -->

### are stressed and tense, increasing their health problems. Unlike the

<!-- chunk -->

### endomorphs, the mesomorphs tend not to accept what life hands them,

<!-- chunk -->

### the process of aging, for instance. They belong to the cult of youth and

<!-- chunk -->

### do not necessarily collect the wisdom that comes with the years.

<!-- chunk -->

## Endomorph. This type develops out of a preponderance on the

<!-- chunk -->

### endoderm, the fetal layer that creates the digestive organs and intestines.

<!-- chunk -->

### As a consequence they eat more, gain weight, are thicker in build and

<!-- chunk -->

### rounder in feature. The nerves are less exposed, and the endomorph is

<!-- chunk -->

### more likely to come across as calm, good-natured, easy-going,

<!-- chunk -->

### sympathetic, humorous, friendly, jovial, and affectionate. Some,

<!-- chunk -->

### however, are of a more lethargic, dense, heavy disposition, with less

<!-- chunk -->

### humor and interest in the outside world. In attitude, the endomorph

<!-- chunk -->

### tends to be practical, accepts the reality of situations, and is more rooted

<!-- chunk -->

### in an earthy, sensuous world. Because of the preponderant emphasis on

<!-- chunk -->

### the digestive tract, the endomorphs tend to enjoy and focus on eating,

<!-- chunk -->

### becoming thereby overweight, if not checked by discipline and exercise,

<!-- chunk -->

### both of which they tend to dislike. Endomorphs like all sensuous

<!-- chunk -->

### experiences: eating, drinking, and making merry. Because of the

<!-- chunk -->

### emphasis on intake, psychologically the endomorphs tend to be

<!-- chunk -->

### accepting of people and changes, regarding life experiences as material

<!-- chunk -->

### to be absorbed and assimilated. However, this can degenerate into lack

<!-- chunk -->

### of motivation, apathy, and complacency. They gain weight with age, and

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes become slothful, but they tend to remain functionally strong.

<!-- chunk -->

## The Three Classes of Organs

<!-- chunk -->

### The threefold system provides a basis for understanding which organs

<!-- chunk -->

### will be dominant, overactive, stressed, or underactive. In order to keep

<!-- chunk -->

### this important information in mind, we will draw up a table of

<!-- chunk -->

### correlations between the three embryological layers, the three primary

<!-- chunk -->

### constitutions, and the organ systems.

<!-- chunk -->

### We often see the correlation between, say, the nervous system and the

<!-- chunk -->

### skin. Many diaphoretics that open the pores of the skin also relax the

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system and help maintain body temperature, hence acting on

<!-- chunk -->

### the nerves and circulation. Work on the muscular and skeletal tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### often contributes to the health of the kidneys and cardiovascular system,

<!-- chunk -->

### since all these tissues and organs rely heavily on the same

<!-- chunk -->

### electrolyte/serum balances. Almost all the organs listed under the

<!-- chunk -->

### visceral/kapha heading are subject to becoming waterlogged, while

<!-- chunk -->

### those in the nervous/vata profile tend to atrophy. At the same time,

<!-- chunk -->

### there are interactions between these columns. Skin, kidneys, lungs, and

<!-- chunk -->

### large intestine are all organs of elimination. We need to see the ebb and

<!-- chunk -->

### flow of disease across the complex field of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

## Neuroendocrine System and Constitution

<!-- chunk -->

### The adrenals are responsible for setting up the body’s basic strategy for

<!-- chunk -->

### coping with stress, the originating factor for disease. They have three

<!-- chunk -->

### basic mechanisms for dealing with stress—the adrenaline, glucocorticoid

<!-- chunk -->

### (GC) and mineralocorticoid (MC) pathways. The former activates the

<!-- chunk -->

### nervous system but deactivates the digestion, so it tends to produce a

<!-- chunk -->

### hyper-alert, nervous, anxious, thin type—the vata/nervous constitution.

<!-- chunk -->

### The GC pathway promotes a non-inflammatory response to stress, which

<!-- chunk -->

### increases appetite and digestion, blood sugar levels, weight gain, and

<!-- chunk -->

### decreases immune response to cause weight gain, lymphatic stagnation,

<!-- chunk -->

### water and toxin retention, more or less the kapha type. When the MC

<!-- chunk -->

### pathway is prominent, the organism responds with increased

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammatory response, higher immune activity and liver catabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### increased sodium levels, decreased water retention but inflammatory

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues, increased periphery circulation (red, hot, swollen, tender), and a

<!-- chunk -->

### lean or medium figure—the pitta constitution. The GC people tend to be

<!-- chunk -->

### thinking, problem-solvers, while the MC people are fighters who jump in

<!-- chunk -->

### and oppose the enemy before thinking of a solution. Additional

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrine factors (pituitary, thyroid, pancreas) also help develop

<!-- chunk -->

### constitutional tendencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### The cardiovascular system in particular, is susceptible to changes from

<!-- chunk -->

### the dominance of these three coping mechanisms. This is true of both

<!-- chunk -->

### the heart and the circulation. The gastrointestinal system,

<!-- chunk -->

### lymph/immune system, liver, and kidneys are also affected. The

<!-- chunk -->

### respiratory tract and bladder, open as they are to the outside world, are

<!-- chunk -->

### more affected by environmental influences and less by constitutional or

<!-- chunk -->

### endocrine programming.

<!-- chunk -->

### he main symptoms of heat are classic: heat, swelling, redness, and

<!-- chunk -->

### tenderness. However, heat can arise from a number of causes. The

<!-- chunk -->

### heat we are looking for here is that which arises from an inherent

<!-- chunk -->

### over-activity in the tissues themselves. There is an excitement of

<!-- chunk -->

### function, so that the tissues are too easily irritated and incited to action.

<!-- chunk -->

### We find this type of over-activity in auto-immune excess conditions. One

<!-- chunk -->

### of the most characteristic symptoms of excitation is an elongated,

<!-- chunk -->

### pointed, flame-shaped, carmine/red, or pink/red tongue. This is often

<!-- chunk -->

### described in the old literature and is found in all of the following

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies, to my knowledge, except Melissa.

<!-- chunk -->

### When heat arises from the breakdown of waste products in the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### or bacterial activity, or from a lack of water to lubricate and cool the

<!-- chunk -->

### tissues, we are looking at heat as a secondary symptom, not as a primary

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state. Thus, heat from sepsis and deterioration requires stimulants,

<!-- chunk -->

### not sedatives, while heat from a lack of fluids requires moistening

<!-- chunk -->

### agents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Excitation, irritation, or heat especially affects the mucosa, creating

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. It also irritates and

<!-- chunk -->

### congests the capillaries, causing renal congestion and cardiovascular

<!-- chunk -->

### complications.

<!-- chunk -->

### The principal remedies that reduce heat or excitation are, in my

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, sour fruity plants. The sour taste is said to be pitta or fire-

<!-- chunk -->

### generating, but this refers primarily to the “post digestive effects.” Large

<!-- chunk -->

### doses of acids are burning. However, in practice the sour fruit acids

<!-- chunk -->

### almost invariably reduce heat, excitation, or overstimulation of the cells.

<!-- chunk -->

### Think of fruit on a hot summer day. Most fruits are in fact defined as

<!-- chunk -->

### refrigerants, even in Ayurveda.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many members of the Rosaceae family have long been classified as

<!-- chunk -->

### refrigerants or coolants: Rosa (rosehip, rose petal), Fragaria (strawberry),

<!-- chunk -->

### Prunus persica (peach), Amygdalus amara (bitter almond), Crataegus

<!-- chunk -->

### (hawthorn), and Prunus serotina (wild cherry). Other sour plants are also

<!-- chunk -->

### sedative: Rhus typhina (sumac berry), Melissa (lemon balm), Sambucus

<!-- chunk -->

### (elder flower or berry), Passiflora (passionflower), Rheum (rhubarb root),

<!-- chunk -->

### Rumex crispus (yellow dock root), Rumex acetosella (sheep sorrel), Oxalis

<!-- chunk -->

### (wood sorrel), and Hibiscus.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are some anomalous remedies. A very important remedy, which

<!-- chunk -->

### is sedative and yet stimulating, is Achillea (yarrow). It reduces capillary

<!-- chunk -->

### congestion and heat by stimulating venous circulation. As a group, the

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants treat the opposite tissue state, depression. An elongated,

<!-- chunk -->

### flame-shaped, pink-red tongue with a blue undertone in the center

<!-- chunk -->

### showing the combination of excitation and stagnant blood or depression

<!-- chunk -->

### indicates Achillea.

<!-- chunk -->

### There is also a group of bitter mints (Scutellaria, Leonurus, Lycopus)

<!-- chunk -->

### which decrease heat/excitation and dry/atrophy, especially in

<!-- chunk -->

### conjunction with hyperthyroid tendencies.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are several different kinds of heat. Only that associated with an

<!-- chunk -->

### acceleration in the rate of tissue function—an increase in the innate heat

<!-- chunk -->

### of life—is associated with the irritated tissue state. Heat can also arise

<!-- chunk -->

### from the depressed tissue state because inactive cells (low oxidation)

<!-- chunk -->

### deteriorate and produce heat due to chemical decomposition and

<!-- chunk -->

### bacterial activity. This type of heat is secondary, not primary. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### traditionally called “putrefaction.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Heat can may rise from a lack of fluids. This is associated with the

<!-- chunk -->

### dry/atrophic tissue state, and is treated by moistening herbs such as

<!-- chunk -->

### Althea (marshmallow), Tilia (linden flower), Stellaria (chickweed),

<!-- chunk -->

### Cucurbita (watermelon), and Plantago (plantain). The archetypal sedative

<!-- chunk -->

### for the nineteenth-century doctors was Asclepias tuberosa (pleurisy root),

<!-- chunk -->

### a sweet, moistening herb.

<!-- chunk -->

### A note on the following descriptions of plants and their uses: The section

<!-- chunk -->

### on “Literature” at the end of each plant portrait attempts to give credit

<!-- chunk -->

### to sources for especially unique and original contributions to our

<!-- chunk -->

### knowledge of the medicinal uses of the plant. When a number is

<!-- chunk -->

### included after a name, this shows that the source contributed a

<!-- chunk -->

### prominent symptom. The number refers to the symptom under the

<!-- chunk -->

### heading “Specific Indications,” counting down from the top.

<!-- chunk -->

### Many symptoms are not credited to a single author because they are

<!-- chunk -->

### well known or the original source is unknown. Sometimes, authors are

<!-- chunk -->

### listed who contributed to knowledge of an herb in a significant fashion,

<!-- chunk -->

### but this information is not easily reduced to a single symptom. Giving

<!-- chunk -->

### the actual source by date and page seemed inappropriately tedious, so I

<!-- chunk -->

### developed the above-described method. The idea was not to fulfill

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific standards (which don’t exist for this sort of thing), but to

<!-- chunk -->

### provide practical guidance. Generally, the information can be found in

<!-- chunk -->

### the prominent writings of the person cited under the name of the herb. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is usually not hard to find the account of the herb in most herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### literature since the name is used as a heading.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Specific Indications” are uniquely based on a combination of personal

<!-- chunk -->

### experience and the ability to express, in a succinct manner, an

<!-- chunk -->

### experience of disease as “wrong of life.” They are therefore an

<!-- chunk -->

### expression of the “energetic” experience of the practitioner. The

<!-- chunk -->

### discovery of new information reflects personal experience and deserves

<!-- chunk -->

### to be credited. It is also a matter of responsibility. If a symptom given by

<!-- chunk -->

### one practitioner is not borne out in the experience of others, then the

<!-- chunk -->

### source should be held responsible.

<!-- chunk -->

### Unfortunately, experience is not considered the basis of credible fact

<!-- chunk -->

### in modern biomedicine. It is dismissed as “anecdotal evidence.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Practitioners of an alternative form of health care must therefore

<!-- chunk -->

### develop our own standards and give credit where it is due. Perhaps it

<!-- chunk -->

### would be better to consider this credit as an artistic, rather than a

<!-- chunk -->

### scientific, responsibility.

<!-- chunk -->

## Prunus persica, Amygdalus persica (Peach)

<!-- chunk -->

### Listen to the following language; it is a perfect example of nineteenth-

<!-- chunk -->

### century botanical energetics, localizing both the tissue state (irritation or

<!-- chunk -->

### excitation) and the organ (stomach). “Of all remedies in the materia

<!-- chunk -->

### medica, there are few, if any, so valuable in the treatment of irritation of

<!-- chunk -->

### the stomach and its complications as this one. Its effect is both sedative

<!-- chunk -->

### and tonic to this organ, according to the dose given and the frequency of

<!-- chunk -->

### its repetition. When there is great irritation of the stomach, shown by an

<!-- chunk -->

### elongated, pointed tongue, with reddened tip and edges, and the patient

<!-- chunk -->

### is nervous, restless, and inclined to vomit even from a teaspoonful of

<!-- chunk -->

### water, or the smell or sight of anything to eat, with acute tenderness

<!-- chunk -->

### over the stomach, peach tree will act as a sedative, and should be given

<!-- chunk -->

### in frequently repeated doses.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder, quoted by Dr. John William Fyfe (1909, 368), continues:

<!-- chunk -->

### “Peach tree is the remedy for vomiting when due to irritation, and the

<!-- chunk -->

### above symptoms present; for vomiting of nervous origin; and many times

<!-- chunk -->

### it is an excellent medicament in the vomiting of pregnancy, and will

<!-- chunk -->

### relieve when everything else fails. In gastritis, either acute or chronic,

<!-- chunk -->

### with other indicated remedies, amygdalus is always the treatment. With

<!-- chunk -->

### the symptoms here enumerated pronounced, it is the remedy never to be

<!-- chunk -->

### overlooked or forgotten in cholera infantum, in cholera morbus, and in

<!-- chunk -->

### the debilitating diarrheas and dysenteries so common in children in the

<!-- chunk -->

### summer months.” See the case history on this page.

<!-- chunk -->

### The slight mucilaginous quality of the peach is what makes it tonic in

<!-- chunk -->

### addition to sedative. It acts somewhat more precisely when heat is

<!-- chunk -->

### complicated with dryness. Samuel Thomson (1825, 63) used peach “to

<!-- chunk -->

### recover the natural tone of the stomach after long sickness; and to

<!-- chunk -->

### restore weak patients, particularly in dysentery. A tea made of the leaves

<!-- chunk -->

### of the peach-tree is very good for bowel complaints in children and

<!-- chunk -->

### young people, and will remove cholic.” It is indicated when there is

<!-- chunk -->

### wasting and emaciation with diarrhea.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. O. Phelps Brown (1863, 119) writes that peach leaves are useful

<!-- chunk -->

### “in all inflammations of the stomach and abdomen. They act as a

<!-- chunk -->

### sedative in doses of a tablespoonful every hour or two of the cold

<!-- chunk -->

### infusion. In larger doses, the infusion slightly acts upon the bowels, and

<!-- chunk -->

### has been found useful in removing worms. The kernels [unopened pits]

<!-- chunk -->

### are similarly employed in the form of tincture, infusion, or syrup.”

<!-- chunk -->

### William Cook (1869, 243) concurs in the use of large doses of peach

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves as a laxative to remove worms. “In large quantities, they act

<!-- chunk -->

### mildly upon the bowels, securing mucous discharges without pain; and

<!-- chunk -->

### in this act many times leading to the expulsion of worms in their nests.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are best given in infusion … fresh.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Prunus persica is also beneficial in food allergies. Eva Graf (1978, 76–

<!-- chunk -->

### 9) used peach pit tea as a long-term digestive tonic. She recommends

<!-- chunk -->

### several tablespoons of peach pit or twig tea before and after a meal as a

<!-- chunk -->

### tonic in weak digestion. She used it this way for six, nine, or even twelve

<!-- chunk -->

### months. She said it is most effective for people having trouble digesting

<!-- chunk -->

### protein—usually a stomach ailment—and where there is a lot of gas. Boil

<!-- chunk -->

### the pits and discard those that break open.

<!-- chunk -->

### When my good friend and comrade in herbalism Julia Graves was

<!-- chunk -->

### visiting in Minnesota, I recommended peach tincture for food allergies.

<!-- chunk -->

### “That’s interesting,” she said. “Peach is my first and worst allergy.” We

<!-- chunk -->

### had to make it very dilute, like a homepathic

IX

<!-- chunk -->

### potency (one part in nine

<!-- chunk -->

### parts neutral spirits or water). “One drop gave me a sore throat. Now, I

<!-- chunk -->

### can take three drops, three times a day. I can now eat wheat better than

<!-- chunk -->

### before, my allergic reactions are less acute, and I have no more hay fever

<!-- chunk -->

### (that might be due to change of location, also), and I can eat one peach,

<!-- chunk -->

### kind-of OK! I still react, but only a little.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Peach is a superlative remedy for the irritative tissue state, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### for heat and irritation in people with sensitive skin and tissues. It is also

<!-- chunk -->

### used for nervous agitation with gastric irritation and inflammation. The

<!-- chunk -->

### leaves, twigs, bark, and unopened kernels are used but the seed is

<!-- chunk -->

### poisonous due to the high content of hydrocyanic acid. The classic

<!-- chunk -->

### indication for heat and irritation, an elongated, pink/red tongue, is

<!-- chunk -->

### always present.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a case history demonstrating the utility of peach in allergies

<!-- chunk -->

### and asthma. A school teacher in her early thirties came to me for

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies that started after she went to work in an unventilated,

<!-- chunk -->

### windowless, carpeted classroom. It had been getting progressively worse

<!-- chunk -->

### over five years; now it was even bad during summer vacation and she

<!-- chunk -->

### reacted to a lot of other things: the down comforter, wine, corn, milk,

<!-- chunk -->

### etc. She was on an antihistamine and an inhalant as the condition went

<!-- chunk -->

### into asthma. Fair-skinned and blond (a typical Minnesotan), red, dry skin

<!-- chunk -->

### on cheeks and arms, red and scaly spots on the lower legs, slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### sunburned from a few hours of sunshine in early May, a picture of

<!-- chunk -->

### sensitivity. Dark under the eyes, characteristic of a good sinus or

<!-- chunk -->

### bronchial infection with lymphatic stagnation in the adjacent drainage

<!-- chunk -->

### and stress on the adrenals from all the allergy reactions or medicines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tired, worn out, coughing, wheezing, asthmatic episodes, slight post-

<!-- chunk -->

### nasal drip. Expectorates brown globs of mucus in the morning. Tip of

<!-- chunk -->

### tongue red, sides scalloped, center slightly coated yellow and dry, pulse

<!-- chunk -->

### slow, slightly choppy, tense, and elevated. Peach tincture (leaf, twig),

<!-- chunk -->

### three drops as needed, lessened the cough and irritation, cleared out the

<!-- chunk -->

### mucus, and reduced the need for drugs completely within two weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### She kept taking the peach, as needed, for two years, with slow, steady

<!-- chunk -->

### improvement in her immunity and no need for the drugs.

<!-- chunk -->

### I always wondered if peach fruit had the same properties as peach

<!-- chunk -->

### leaf. John Heinerman indicates that it does. He recommends the juice for

<!-- chunk -->

### fevers, indigestion, and morning sickness, the standard uses for peach

<!-- chunk -->

### leaf. He also recommends pear juice as a substitute and even gives a case

<!-- chunk -->

### of tuberculosis ameliorated by pear juice.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bark is stronger than the leaves (Tommie Bass). Heat destroys the

<!-- chunk -->

### virtues. Cold infusion of the leaves, small twigs, and bark of the small

<!-- chunk -->

### limbs or maceration in brandy or alcohol. Dose, 1–10 drops of the

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture or extract (Fyfe). The kernels are cleaned and dried for making a

<!-- chunk -->

### cold decoction (Kate Gilday).

## Taste: sour, bitter, sweet, cool, moist, slightly mucilaginous.

## Rosa canina, Rosa spp.

<!-- chunk -->

## (Wild Rose, Domestic Rose)

<!-- chunk -->

### Rose hips are sour and astringent. In Greek medicine, they are classified

<!-- chunk -->

### as cooling and drying. Apropos of this, Maude Grieve (1931, 690) writes

<!-- chunk -->

### that they “were long official in the British Pharmacopoeia for refrigerant

<!-- chunk -->

### and astringent properties.” She says they are “useful in diarrhea and

<!-- chunk -->

### dysentery, allaying thirst.” They are also beneficial for “coughs and

<!-- chunk -->

### spitting of blood” due to heat and irritation. Avicenna, the great

<!-- chunk -->

### medieval authority, cured bloody expectoration with rose jelly alone and

<!-- chunk -->

### in subsequent centuries the use of rose became established for the

<!-- chunk -->

### treatment of tuberculosis. This is certainly a condition where we would

<!-- chunk -->

### have heat/irritation and bleeding, i.e., the perfect indications for a

<!-- chunk -->

### cooling astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

### Numerous members of the rose clan are extensively used in the

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine of the world. The Greeks, Romans, and Arabic physicians used

<!-- chunk -->

### them. The American wild rose was a favorite with native people. In

<!-- chunk -->

### recent times, rose hips have been used on the premise that they are high

<!-- chunk -->

### in vitamin C. They are also considered to be anti-oxidant. The petals,

<!-- chunk -->

### sepals, hips, leaves, stalks, roots, root bark, and thorns have all been

<!-- chunk -->

### used in traditional medicine. Salmon (1710, 956), lists fifty different

<!-- chunk -->

### preparations.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rose is the personification of passion yet we find that rose and many

<!-- chunk -->

### of its relatives (peach, wild cherry, hawthorn) reduce heat. My poetic

<!-- chunk -->

### muse tells me that these plants turn down excitement in the limbic

<!-- chunk -->

### centers, which regulate both heat and passion. The rosaceae are primary

<!-- chunk -->

### remedies for reducing auto-immune heat and irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Wild or dog rose was the standard remedy in the Roman period for

<!-- chunk -->

### rabies. According to Plinius, the mother of a centurion who dreamed

<!-- chunk -->

### that her son had been bitten by a dog introduced this usage during the

<!-- chunk -->

### Augustan period. She also dreamed of the remedy for him. After his

<!-- chunk -->

### recovery, the emperor publicized this usage.

<!-- chunk -->

### The hips and petals are used for acute inflammatory conditions of the

<!-- chunk -->

### respiratory tract, including sore throat, free nasal secretion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### bronchial secretion or obstruction. It is also a remedy for chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation. It is indicated in the weakness of convalescence, old age,

<!-- chunk -->

### and delicate children. Rose also acts on heat in the digestive tract,

<!-- chunk -->

### including diarrhea, dysentery, and stubborn inflammatory conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

### Maurice Messague (1979, 248) recommends it to counteract the ill

<!-- chunk -->

### effects of antibiotics on the intestinal flora. It is also used for vaginal

<!-- chunk -->

### discharge, menstrual irregularity, and yeast infection (local and

<!-- chunk -->

### systemic). Rose petal waters, lotions, or baths are used to cure arthritis

<!-- chunk -->

### from heat, probably an auto-immune condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalist Phyllis Light gives a more specific description of rose. “I tend

<!-- chunk -->

### to use rose hips when the mucous membranes needs to be dried up and

<!-- chunk -->

### cooled down. It helps the body eliminate more through the colon than

<!-- chunk -->

### the kidneys. I ask people if they’re constipated. If they are constipated

<!-- chunk -->

### there is usually a little bit of mucus when they do have a movement. The

<!-- chunk -->

### stool is more ball-like, less formed, with mucus wrapped around or in it.

<!-- chunk -->

### The constipation is due to the fact that the stool is too damp and

<!-- chunk -->

### unformed for the colon to push it out.” Rumex crispus has this symptom;

<!-- chunk -->

### the muscles are too weak to move out the stool.

<!-- chunk -->

### “People might think this is a remedy for mucus colitis, but the

<!-- chunk -->

### problem may arise further up in the system and is just emptying out

<!-- chunk -->

### through the colon. There may be a lot of allergies and lymphatic

<!-- chunk -->

### stagnation further up in the system. To confirm this, I have the person

<!-- chunk -->

### lie down and I press up under the left rib cage to feel if the diaphragm is

<!-- chunk -->

### pressed down by the congestion of the thoracic duct. When that valve is

<!-- chunk -->

### closed, there are going to be allergies, lymphatic congestion, and

<!-- chunk -->

### constipation. Everything stagnates back up the lymphatic system, all the

<!-- chunk -->

### way up to the head, sinuses, and glands in back of the head. Sometimes,

<!-- chunk -->

### when you release the thoracic duct, you can hear the gurgling and

<!-- chunk -->

### everything starts to release. With the lymphatic congestion there will

<!-- chunk -->

### usually be an irritative, nonproductive cough.”

<!-- chunk -->

### I find rose to be slightly less useful than its cousin peach, because the

<!-- chunk -->

### latter combines heat with dryness, a very common condition. The look of

<!-- chunk -->

### the tongue is similar, but peach has an elongated, red/carmine, dry

<!-- chunk -->

### tongue, while rose usually has a red, elongated, and pointed, with

<!-- chunk -->

### streamers of dampness down the sides.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosehips are the usual part used most frequently today, in capsule,

<!-- chunk -->

### tablet, or seldom, tincture or glycerite. The flowers, leaves, bark, root

<!-- chunk -->

### bark, and even the thorns have all been used in traditional medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (hips) sour, sweet, cool, astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: excitation, relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: mucosa, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, lymphatics.

### system when there is sympathetic excess, hyperadrenalinism, or

<!-- chunk -->

### hyperthyroidism. Like many sour plants, it is cooling. It is often

### combined with Lycopus in hyperthyroidism or is specific by itself.

### A seventy-six-year-old man came to see me because he had an

<!-- chunk -->

### aneurysm. I gave yarrow (it had worked once before), plus a bunch of

<!-- chunk -->

### basic heart tonics, like hawthorn and tulip poplar. A year went by, and

<!-- chunk -->

### while I helped him with some minor skin and eye annoyances, the

<!-- chunk -->

### aneurysm only enlarged. Finally, we had to do something about it or

<!-- chunk -->

### surgery would be necessary. I looked at the case afresh. Over the past

<!-- chunk -->

### few months his face had gotten red, he had gained ten pounds, and he

<!-- chunk -->

### was having night sweats. His pulse was sharp-edged and irregular; his

<!-- chunk -->

### tongue was strongly red/pink. This suggested sympathetic nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### excess with heat/irritation. I finally decided on that great sympathetic

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxant and sedative for the heart, Melissa. Six months later the

<!-- chunk -->

### aneurysm was smaller, the night sweats were long gone, the weight was

<!-- chunk -->

### back to normal, pulse less irregular and relaxed, tongue less red. We

<!-- chunk -->

### were both very happy.

<!-- chunk -->

### A fifty-six-year-old woman came to me for severe short term memory

<!-- chunk -->

### loss which occurred after she received various potencies of homeopathic

<!-- chunk -->

### Cannabis from a young homeopathic enthusiast. She had never had much

<!-- chunk -->

### marijuana as a youth, so I am not sure why this remedy was chosen, but

<!-- chunk -->

### it caused severe psychological hardship. She felt out of her body, had

<!-- chunk -->

### memory lapses severe enough to send her to biomedical doctors; and a

<!-- chunk -->

### continual mental tension that made it hard to think. The pulse was

<!-- chunk -->

### slightly tense and sharp, shifting slowly from faster to slower. Melissa

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture, five drops as needed, cleared up these problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### The fresh plant is so much superior to the dried that it should be

<!-- chunk -->

### picked from the garden for tea or tinctured fresh in a good, sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### brandy. Dosage can be small (one to three drops) to large (ten to thirty

<!-- chunk -->

### drops).

## Taste: sour, cool.

## Rumex crispus (Yellow Dock Root)

<!-- chunk -->

### Yellow dock root is sour, astringent, and faintly bitter, therefore suited

<!-- chunk -->

### to conditions where there is heat/irritation combined with relaxation

<!-- chunk -->

### and a little congestion. It contains small amounts of anthroquinones,

<!-- chunk -->

### which are purgative, but it is better to think of it as a heat-reducer

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than as a laxative. Like its cousin rhubarb, it would be badly and

<!-- chunk -->

### incompletely defined in this way. It is always indicated by an elongated

<!-- chunk -->

### tongue with red on the sides or middle, so it is a remedy for

<!-- chunk -->

### heat/irritation. Often there is a thrushlike coating and it is indeed a

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy for thrush, a symptom often associated with relaxation. The

<!-- chunk -->

### facial skin is usually red and dry on the checks, showing heat and

<!-- chunk -->

### dryness, with yellow around the eyes, nose, and mouth, showing heat in

<!-- chunk -->

### the digestive tract. This last indication comes from my friend Lise Wolff.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yellow dock root is a primary remedy in the treatment of heat in the

<!-- chunk -->

### GI tract. It is indicated when there is an over abundance of saliva,

<!-- chunk -->

### showing that there is digestive over activity and excessive appetite,

<!-- chunk -->

### when there is excessive hydrochloric acid, with esophageal reflux and

<!-- chunk -->

### burning, and when there is irritable heat in the small intestine or colon

<!-- chunk -->

### causing Crohn’s disease or colitis. The stool is frequently moist, pappy,

<!-- chunk -->

### and difficult to expel, with an unfinished feeling and, sometimes

<!-- chunk -->

### hemorrhoids. In addition, yellow dock root acts on the skin and may

<!-- chunk -->

### have an alterative or sanative effect through the liver and gall bladder.

<!-- chunk -->

### Drugs for esophageal reflux and acid stomach are the biggest sellers in

<!-- chunk -->

### America at the present time. In the past, this has been an area with few

<!-- chunk -->

### options in the herbal pharmacopoeia. If people only knew about yellow

<!-- chunk -->

### dock root. It comes close to being a specific in this condition. Wooster

<!-- chunk -->

### Beach (1842, 420) reported the use of yellow dock root tea to cure an

<!-- chunk -->

### acid stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a case history from my own records. A forty-five-year-old man

<!-- chunk -->

### had been suffering from loose stools, difficult to move for about six or

<!-- chunk -->

### seven years. He also had a hemorrhoid that bled from time to time,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially when the stool was difficult to pass. He had excess salivation

<!-- chunk -->

### and appetite, occasional esophageal reflux, and stomach acidity. The

<!-- chunk -->

### tongue was elongated, flame-like, with reddish coloration, and a thick,

<!-- chunk -->

### moist, yellow coating. All these symptoms are classic for yellow dock

<!-- chunk -->

### root. Doses of the tincture, when needed, over the next two years

<!-- chunk -->

### removed all the symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

### What yellow dock does for the stomach it will do further down the

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive canal. Forbush (quoted by Fyfe, 1909) gives the following

<!-- chunk -->

### description: “In diarrhea and dysentery Rumex is a remedy of very great

<!-- chunk -->

### value. It has cured exceedingly persistent cases of exhaustive morning

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea with the following symptoms, viz.: Evacuations scanty, bloody,

<!-- chunk -->

### oftentimes offensive, colicky pains before and after stool, sinking at the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach, fetid breath, sweat, and urine; the discharges being very

<!-- chunk -->

### frequent between early morning and midday. In the asthenic forms of

<!-- chunk -->

### intestinal wrongs, and in the diarrhea of phthisis, it affects the bowels,

<!-- chunk -->

### sensibly reacting as a mild astringent not unlike rhubarb. It is especially

<!-- chunk -->

### serviceable in the dysentery of aged persons, and has been used

<!-- chunk -->

### successfully in apparently hopeless cases.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Rumex is a superlative remedy for enteritis and colitis. Here is a case

<!-- chunk -->

### where the small intestine was involved. A forty-two-year-old woman

<!-- chunk -->

### came to see me for Crohn’s disease. It had been quiet for about ten years,

<!-- chunk -->

### but recently her home life flared up, she threatened to leave her husband

<!-- chunk -->

### (“he’s so boring”), and she suffered a serious recurrence. The tongue was

<!-- chunk -->

### elongated, with red sides and tip, with a little bit of thrushlike coating

<!-- chunk -->

### one sometimes sees on the back of the tongue when this remedy is

<!-- chunk -->

### needed. (A thrushlike coating looks like the coat on brie cheese). She

<!-- chunk -->

### had the usual pains in the abdomen, and diarrhea. Three drops of Rumex

<!-- chunk -->

### crispus, three times a day proved curative. At her next doctor’s

<!-- chunk -->

### appointment, two weeks later, she was informed that the intestine had

<!-- chunk -->

### not looked this good in two years. She continues to do well eight months

<!-- chunk -->

### later, but as people with Crohn’s are prone to setbacks, we will wait and

<!-- chunk -->

### see how the situation resolves itself.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a case where the problem was in the colon. I was called to the

<!-- chunk -->

### hospital to see a thirty-four-year-old woman suffering from severe colitis.

<!-- chunk -->

### It had started five weeks after the birth of her third child. She was on

<!-- chunk -->

### sixty milligrams of prednisone daily; it provided no help whatsoever. She

<!-- chunk -->

### was having fifteen to twenty dysenteric movements a day and the

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors were saying that if it didn’t stop they would remove her colon in

<!-- chunk -->

### three days. I noticed that her face was irritated, and red with yellow

<!-- chunk -->

### patches; it looked like serum was coming up to the surface. This

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated yellow dock root (see below). I gave a half dropper in water.

<!-- chunk -->

### She was constipated for two days and recovered completely. Three years

<!-- chunk -->

### later there has been no major relapse. Every time some little diarrhea

<!-- chunk -->

### starts, she takes a few doses of yellow dock root. She has been on a drug

<!-- chunk -->

### for enteritis all these years and was afraid to stop taking it. However, it

<!-- chunk -->

### is the yellow dock root that, again and again, controls the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### when they arise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here’s a case history relating to acute diarrhea. My friend Julia Graves

<!-- chunk -->

### helped a friend in India with constant morning diarrhea lasting for days.

<!-- chunk -->

### He had a red, dry tongue with a white coat. One dose cured this

<!-- chunk -->

### condition.

<!-- chunk -->

### In addition to acting on the gastrointestinal tract, yellow dock acts on

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin. It is indicated in weeping eczema, when there is a rusty-red

<!-- chunk -->

### appearance to the skin (like the color of ripened yellow dock seed) with

<!-- chunk -->

### some yellowness, or actual weeping of yellow serum.

<!-- chunk -->

### The root is collected after going to seed in mid-summer and used by

<!-- chunk -->

### decoction or tincture. Usual dose of the tincture, five to thirty drops

<!-- chunk -->

### (Fyfe).

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (root) slightly sour, bitter, cool, damp, astringent, “moldy.”

<!-- chunk -->

### (leaves) sour, astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue States: irritation, relaxation, stagnation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: gastrointestinal, skin.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Yellow about the eyes, nose, and mouth with reddish, often dry

<!-- chunk -->

### checks.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Throat swollen, sensitive and dark red, with little pain or absence of

<!-- chunk -->

### pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nursing sore mouth and ulceration of the mucosa of the mouth

### • Irritable cough, worse in cold air.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Slow digestion; food sits in the stomach or the colon, like a brick.

### • Pain in the lower back caused by constipation; the patient is not

<!-- chunk -->

### necessarily aware of the lessened elimination, but of the pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Lessened activity of the intestinal canal; food sits or is poorly expelled

<!-- chunk -->

### by the rectum.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Hemorrhoids, with bleeding, itching, smarting; poor expulsion of stool

<!-- chunk -->

### (cf. Polygonum punctatum, a cousin).

<!-- chunk -->

### • Menstrual irregularities with anemia; amenorrhea; vicarious

### when nervous symptoms predominate.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Red, damp, corrosive skin conditions.

### • Fetid breath, sweat, urine.

<!-- chunk -->

## Achillea millefolium (Yarrow)

<!-- chunk -->

### Yarrow is one of the primal remedies of traditional Western herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. I have discussed it elsewhere in detail and will undoubtedly

<!-- chunk -->

### enlarge upon it in the future, so I will restrain my remarks for the

<!-- chunk -->

### present. The taste is pungent, bitter, and mildly astringent. There is a bit

<!-- chunk -->

### of acridity hidden under the pungency. This should make it a stimulant

<!-- chunk -->

### with slightly relaxant and toning properties, but yarrow is an anomalous

<!-- chunk -->

### plant that does not fit the usual analysis. It is one of the few stimulants

<!-- chunk -->

### that are quite cooling, although there are others such as echinacea and

<!-- chunk -->

### lavender. The main action of yarrow is exerted on the veins, to tone,

<!-- chunk -->

### clarify, and stimulate them, so that it cools by opening up the veins and

<!-- chunk -->

### allowing congestion out of the capillaries. This is exactly how

<!-- chunk -->

### Christopher Hedley, one of the prominent British herbalists describes it,

<!-- chunk -->

### and it accords with my experience as well. Thus it is indicated when

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue is hot, red, tender, and swollen. At the same time, as a bitter/acrid

<!-- chunk -->

### herb it settles fever and chills that affect the circulation, opening pores

<!-- chunk -->

### to release sweat. Yarrow is especially used for (1) lacerations, bruises,

<!-- chunk -->

### and bleeding; (2) fever and chills; (3) heat and congestion in the

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive tract, portal vein, liver, and abdominal viscera; and (4) uterine

<!-- chunk -->

### congestion and excessive (or lack of) bleeding. It is excellent for uterine

<!-- chunk -->

### fibroids with bright red bleeding. In several months it will remove large

<!-- chunk -->

### fibroids.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are several specific indications leading especially to yarrow. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### almost always indicated by an elongated, pointed, reddish tongue (the

<!-- chunk -->

### classic indication for heat/irritation), but there is usually a blue

<!-- chunk -->

### undertone indicating venous stagnation. The tongue is usually dry in the

<!-- chunk -->

### center, indicating that heat is driving off fluids. These indications come

<!-- chunk -->

### from my own practice. The pulse is usually rapid, full, and non-resistant,

<!-- chunk -->

### showing that heat is having its way with the tissues. William LeSassier

<!-- chunk -->

### taught that there may be a crack down the center of the tongue, in

<!-- chunk -->

### severe cases opening up to reveal a deeper layer of tissue which is dark

<!-- chunk -->

### and crisscrossed by lines (chained or feathered). This is an indication

<!-- chunk -->

### that heat is burning deep into the tissues, especially of the digestive

<!-- chunk -->

### tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### The flower tops are harvested at their peak and dried for use as a tea or

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctured fresh in alcohol. The young leaves and roots may also be used.

<!-- chunk -->

### The best quality yarrow grows on sandy, gravely soil that warms up in

<!-- chunk -->

### the sun and is exposed in winter. Moist soil dilutes the bitter property.

<!-- chunk -->

### Usual dose is five to twenty drops (Fyfe). It should not be taken in large

<!-- chunk -->

### doses during pregnancy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: bitter, pungent, cold, dry, stimulating, diffusive, slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: irritation, depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: blood, veins, capillaries, temperature regulation, GI

<!-- chunk -->

### tract, female reproductive tract.

<!-- chunk -->

### he constrictive tissue state is one of the easiest to recognize

<!-- chunk -->

### because we have all experienced tension—psychological or

<!-- chunk -->

### physical—and suffered from muscle spasms. However, there is

<!-- chunk -->

### some subtlety to this tissue state that might be missed. Repeated chills,

<!-- chunk -->

### as were once common in malaria and still occur in influenza and deep

<!-- chunk -->

### infections, will unstring the autonomic nervous system, causing chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### chills. This was a serious problem in old-time medicine. It is less so

<!-- chunk -->

### today, but there are still many people who have never been better since

<!-- chunk -->

### they suffered from a chill or influenza. In addition to tension and chills,

<!-- chunk -->

### we should also mention as characteristic symptoms that are sudden

<!-- chunk -->

### (coming or going), intermittent, or alternating (like diarrhea and

<!-- chunk -->

### constipation). The mind and nerves are greatly affected by this tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### state. The gastrointestinal tract, which is so intimately associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### the autonomic nervous system, is the physical area most affected.

<!-- chunk -->

### Plants with an acrid flavor are used in Chinese herbalism to treat wind

<!-- chunk -->

### and chill, conditions equivalent to constriction. Almost all of the great

<!-- chunk -->

### antispasmodics traditionally used in the Western pharmacopoeia are

<!-- chunk -->

### acrid. (Acridity tastes like bile in the throat). Since this is an unfamiliar

<!-- chunk -->

### taste, I have listed the flavor of each plant as best I could: Lobelia (purely

<!-- chunk -->

### acrid); Symplocarpus (skunk cabbage; extremely acrid); Piper methysticum

<!-- chunk -->

### (kava kava; acrid and pungent); Liriodendron (tulip poplar; acrid and

<!-- chunk -->

### sweet); Cimicifuga (black cohosh; acrid and sweet); Chamomilla

<!-- chunk -->

### (chamomile; acrid, sweet, bitter and pungent); Valeriana (acrid,

<!-- chunk -->

### pungent); Humulus (hops; acrid and bitter); and Nepeta (catnip; acrid and

<!-- chunk -->

### pungent). Valerian, hops, catnip, and viburnum (or crampbark) all

<!-- chunk -->

### contain substances that break down into valerianic acid.

<!-- chunk -->

### Lobelia was the archetypal relaxant for the old physiomedicalist

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors who came up with the tissue state model. I have not given an

<!-- chunk -->

### account of it here because I covered it thoroughly in The Book of Herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### Wisdom. Valerian and its pharmacological kin would be fairly archetypal

<!-- chunk -->

### too; valerian has the acrid taste moderated by some pungency. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### my favorite relaxant is agrimony. Another superlative relaxant, which is

<!-- chunk -->

### also a building, nutritive tonic, is the sweet/acrid Liriodendron, but that

<!-- chunk -->

### is too obscure a medicine for most of our readers.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another taste which acts on wind, chills, and tension is the “bitter

<!-- chunk -->

### nauseant” flavor of some of the extremely bitter plants like Eupatorium

<!-- chunk -->

### perf. (boneset), Lactuca virosa (wild lettuce), Verbena (blue vervain), and

<!-- chunk -->

### Artemisia absinthium (wormwood). These plants are so bitter they send a

<!-- chunk -->

### chill through the body, hence they are for chills. It is likely that this taste

<!-- chunk -->

### is due to a conjunction of acridity and bitterness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tension can be caused by some of the other tissue states. Dryness or

<!-- chunk -->

### atrophy will cause constriction because water sedates the nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### system. The opposite is also true; constriction of the muscles causes the

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation to be thwarted, resulting in under nutrition of the part,

<!-- chunk -->

### drying, and atrophy. Heat and excitation cause tension by drying out

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids. Relaxation can cause it by piling up blood, which blocks

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Agrimonia eupatoria, A. grysopetela (Agrimony)

<!-- chunk -->

### In my experience, this is the superlative remedy for tension. I have

<!-- chunk -->

### covered it elsewhere extensively (The Book of Herbal Wisdom), so the

<!-- chunk -->

### following account will be brief.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am not sure whether agrimony relieves tension because it is an

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent—many of these agents reduce tension even though one would

<!-- chunk -->

### think otherwise—or whether it works because there is a little bit of acrid

<!-- chunk -->

### resin on the leaves before flowering. Agrimony is fairly bland, but if we

<!-- chunk -->

### study the taste carefully we detect some sweetness, astringency, and

<!-- chunk -->

### acridity. After flowering, the astringency is more pronounced. Those

<!-- chunk -->

### who believe in the doctrine of signatures will note that it is a tense

<!-- chunk -->

### looking plant. I use agrimony collected before flowering and prefer the

<!-- chunk -->

### native American species, A. grysopetela. I use small doses (one to three

<!-- chunk -->

### drops), but any size dose will work. An especially relaxing combination

<!-- chunk -->

### is agrimony (seven parts) and true Solomon’s seal (four parts).

<!-- chunk -->

### The indication for tension originated with Dr. Bach. It holds true on

<!-- chunk -->

### both the mental and physical levels, for both the flower essence and the

<!-- chunk -->

### herbal preparation. The patient tries to hide the tension behind a false

<!-- chunk -->

### facade of suave sophistication or cheerfulness, denying the pain with a

<!-- chunk -->

### smile. I like to say she is “torturedly cheerful.” Others are so cool and

<!-- chunk -->

### suave you think, “How come I’m not going to them for advice? What do

<!-- chunk -->

### they need to see me for?” Or, according to Bach, they like speed and

<!-- chunk -->

### danger, drugs, alcohol, and stimulants. The problem often revolves

<!-- chunk -->

### around business and hierarchical relations (employee/employer).

<!-- chunk -->

### Agrimony is a specific in any condition where the person holds the

<!-- chunk -->

### breath to stop the pain. Patients report all sorts of digestive problems

<!-- chunk -->

### due to tension and incorrect timing of functions. Innervation to the liver,

<!-- chunk -->

### gall bladder, and GI tract is off. Agrimony is a remedy for liver problems,

<!-- chunk -->

### allergies, skin rashes, and wasting (due to poor liver anabolism and

<!-- chunk -->

### catabolism of proteins), diarrhea, ulcerations of the bowels and lower

<!-- chunk -->

### extremities, kidney and bladder pain, menstrual pain and bleeding.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: mildly sweet, sour, acrid, neutral/cool, resinous, slightly

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: constriction, relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: nervous system, gastrointestinal, liver, kidneys.

## Chamomilla matricaria,

<!-- chunk -->

## Matricaria chamomilla (Chamomile)

<!-- chunk -->

### Half a dozen plants go by the name chamomile, all belonging to the

<!-- chunk -->

### Asteraceae or Composite family. Two of them are used in herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, Chamomilla matricaria and Anthemis nobile, sometimes called

<!-- chunk -->

### “German” and “Roman chamomile.” Both contain a blue volatile oil

<!-- chunk -->

### (azulene) which is the active ingredient responsible for the medicinal

<!-- chunk -->

### properties. They have been used interchangeably since antiquity and

<!-- chunk -->

### their uses are not well differentiated in the literature, even in

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chamomile is an old popular medicine in Europe. It has a long history

<!-- chunk -->

### of use in folk medicine as a sedative for cross, whining, irritated babies,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the problems incident to babyhood, such as teething, earaches, and

<!-- chunk -->

### intolerance to pain. The child is peevish, whining, complaining, angry,

<!-- chunk -->

### demanding attention and petting. He demands a toy, then throws it on

<!-- chunk -->

### the floor. Beyond this, however, Chamomilla is suited to “babies of any

<!-- chunk -->

### age,” as I like to say. Whatever the age, the behavior is unmistakable.

<!-- chunk -->

### Petulant, self-centered, intolerant of pain or not having their way,

<!-- chunk -->

### inclined to pick quarrels, or averse to being touched, soothed, or spoken

<!-- chunk -->

### to. It is not suited to infants (Sambucus) or children (chicory), but to

<!-- chunk -->

### babies. It has been proven and is used in homeopathy on the same

<!-- chunk -->

### indications as in herbalism.

<!-- chunk -->

### Certain structures of the body are more susceptible to maddening

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation and pain than others. The ears, eyes, teeth, and sexual organs

<!-- chunk -->

### seem to be the principal organs. Many cases of earache and toothache

<!-- chunk -->

### have been cured by homeopaths.

<!-- chunk -->

### The material herb, the tincture, and the homeopathic potencies meet

<!-- chunk -->

### the same conditions. The fresh herb has considerably more virtue than

<!-- chunk -->

### the dried (Rudolf Weiss). The homeopathic preparations are made from

<!-- chunk -->

### the fresh juice of the herb. A few people are allergic to chamomile.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: sweet, acrid, bitter, cooling.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: irritation, constriction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: babies, GI tract, fever, pain.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Children, during teething, “terrible twos;” fretful, must be carried all

<!-- chunk -->

### the time; wants different things, throws them away when getting

<!-- chunk -->

### them; nightmares. Adults who act in a similar manner; “babies of any

<!-- chunk -->

### age.”

<!-- chunk -->

### • Petulant, quarrelsome, vitiated humor; inclines to be angry and out of

<!-- chunk -->

### sorts with everything and everybody; very impatient, can hardly

<!-- chunk -->

### answer with civility; contrary to normal condition, out of humor,

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly at menses or when sick.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Whining, peevish, complaining, wants attention but rejects it; low

<!-- chunk -->

### resistance to pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Dandruff.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Eye irritation (wash), earache.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Tongue tends to be irritated along the sides and coated white-yellow

<!-- chunk -->

### in the middle.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Acute colds, fevers, flu, coughs, earache; bronchitis, asthma.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Acute digestive upset, coming on after vexation and anger; with heat

<!-- chunk -->

### of the face, thirst, taste of bile, nausea, anxiety, restlessness.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Lack of appetite; cramps, colic, diverticulitis, colitis, diarrhea,

<!-- chunk -->

### constipation, irritable bowel syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Liver and gall bladder upset; jaundice, gallstones, gallstone colic.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Menstrual pain and cramping associated with great tenderness; cannot

<!-- chunk -->

### • Edema.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Tightness and tension in the tendons, ligaments, muscles, and

<!-- chunk -->

### extremities; paralytic pains, with numbness and tearing, in the

<!-- chunk -->

### extremities; convulsion, spasm, tightness, rheumatic pain, and

<!-- chunk -->

### neuralgia.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Incomplete fever; excitement, increased sensibility, prostration; heat

<!-- chunk -->

### partial, confined to one cheek; profuse sweat of the head. The fever

<!-- chunk -->

### does not last long, but often recurs.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Abscess, pus formation, especially in the face, jaws, with tenderness

<!-- chunk -->

### and pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Pulse small, tense, and rapid.

<!-- chunk -->

## Literature: Traditional. The most specific information comes from

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathic provings and clinical experience, including the following

<!-- chunk -->

### indications and authors collected by Temple Hoyne: William Bayes (6),

<!-- chunk -->

### Samuel Hahnemann (8), Carrol Dunham (14), Adolphe Lippe (16).

<!-- chunk -->

## Nepeta cataria (Catnip)

<!-- chunk -->

### Catnip contrasts well with chamomile, since they are both remedies for

<!-- chunk -->

### tension in children. This is not one of my commonly used remedies, but

<!-- chunk -->

### it was one of the favorites of my late friend, William LeSassier, and I

<!-- chunk -->

### thought I would transmit his teachings on the subject, as a small

<!-- chunk -->

### monument. He used it himself when he had a hiatal hernia due to some

<!-- chunk -->

### accident in a martial arts class.

<!-- chunk -->

### Catnip is the mint nervine to give “when in doubt,” i.e., when there is

<!-- chunk -->

### a nervous problem that can’t be differentiated enough to indicate a more

<!-- chunk -->

### specific medicine. The action of catnip centers on the stomach, with

<!-- chunk -->

### anxiety, energy, and pain rising upwards, rather than downwards, as is

<!-- chunk -->

### the case with chamomile. Unlike the chamomile person or child, catnip

<!-- chunk -->

### tends to internalize the stress and goes to the stomach. Think of it as

<!-- chunk -->

### “visceral over-stimulation from the mind.” The stomach is bothered,

<!-- chunk -->

### with a pain in the organ like a heart attack. There is congestion in

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach, and pain from the stomach up to the vagus nerve. Painful

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve involvement. Rising anxiety. Hiatal hernia. Sensation of extreme

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure up against the diaphragm. Colicky gas pains. Anxiety, attacks in

<!-- chunk -->

### the stomach, rising upwards into the chest instead of downwards. Not

<!-- chunk -->

### for sinking, diarrheal anxiety (see chamomile). “Burpitis.” Antidote to

<!-- chunk -->

### bad reactions to onions and garlic. It is suited to mild, not serious, cases

<!-- chunk -->

### of motion sickness, and is good for people who are nervous to be on an

<!-- chunk -->

### airplane.

<!-- chunk -->

### Catnip has a long reputation in the treatment of children’s diseases. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is an old specific for colic in babies at the breast. According to LeSassier,

<!-- chunk -->

### it sweetens the milk. It is suited to mild infantile fever, which is often

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with constipation or colic, whether recognized or not, in the

<!-- chunk -->

### colon. Catnip is a general first aide remedy for children, for the “crisis of

<!-- chunk -->

### childhood.” The old doctors note that the legs of the child are flexed

<!-- chunk -->

### forward, an indication of tension in the colon.

<!-- chunk -->

### William LeSassier’s directions for making the best catnip are precise.

<!-- chunk -->

### Make a nice, strong, green tincture from the fresh plant in flower in a

<!-- chunk -->

### high proof alcohol. Dilute a few drops in water, enough to tint it light

<!-- chunk -->

### green and give a teaspoonful or modest amount. It will take two to three

<!-- chunk -->

### doses to work, so persist. There will be a big belch and the symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### will be relieved. (This is a characteristic symptom of wind or constriction

<!-- chunk -->

### in the stomach.) The herb is gathered before flowering and prepared

<!-- chunk -->

### fresh as a tea, or tincture. It loses properties on drying. “Do not use for

<!-- chunk -->

### extended periods of time with small children. It has an almost narcotic

<!-- chunk -->

### effect when overused” (Daryl Patton, Tommie Bass).

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: acrid, pungent, moist, resinous.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: constriction, depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: skin (diaphoretic), GI, uterus Specific Indications:

<!-- chunk -->

### • Swollen under the eyes.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Infants; nervous, fretful; intestinal colic, constipation, and fever.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Children; over-active, nervous, restless, mean-spirited.

<!-- chunk -->

### • “Tends to internalize stress in the stomach.”

<!-- chunk -->

### • Congestion, pain, and anxiety in the stomach; pain up to the vagus

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Pain in the stomach, mimicking heart attack.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Anxiety attacks felt in the stomach, rising upwards (not downwards to

<!-- chunk -->

### produce diarrhea).

<!-- chunk -->

### • Hiatal hernia; sensation of extreme pressure upwards against the

<!-- chunk -->

### diaphragm; hiccup.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Intestinal colic; draws the legs up for relief.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Colicky gas pains, relieved by burping, belching.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Spasm, pain ascending from the stomach or uterus.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Motion sickness (mild palliative); nervous to be on airplane.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Skin irritation; hives, measles, fever, acne.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Sweetens the milk.

<!-- chunk -->

### • General first aid for infants and children.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Lessens fatigue from muscular exertion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Elisabeth Janos (3), John William Fyfe (11, 13), Tommie Bass (13).

<!-- chunk -->

## Valeriana officinalis (Valerian)

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is acrid and pungent (pungency increases the smell of a plant).

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore it is relaxant and warming. This is not a plant I use much, so I

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t have a lot of stories to tell.

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerian is principally used as a remedy for insomnia or to relax

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles and ease pain. Ellingwood (1919, 125) writes, “its action upon

<!-- chunk -->

### the nervous system is best obtained when the circulation of those centers

<!-- chunk -->

### is inactive and feeble, especially when there is a paleness of the face and

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin is cool. It is directly indicated in hysterical conditions of

<!-- chunk -->

### whatever character with feebleness; with nervous excitement, and

<!-- chunk -->

### morbid vigilance; in hysterical epilepsy [or seizures, really]; and nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### disturbances incident to menopause. Its general soothing effect in all

<!-- chunk -->

### these cases is desirable. It controls distress and imaginary pain and

<!-- chunk -->

### produces quiet, permitting sleep and rest.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Fyfe (1909, 753) writes, “Valerian is an excellent cerebral stimulant,

<!-- chunk -->

### and is employed with advantage in diseases resulting from enfeebled

<!-- chunk -->

### cerebral circulation. Its administration often affords great relief in the

<!-- chunk -->

### high tension common to many nervous states, and in wakefulness it

<!-- chunk -->

### exerts a sleep-producing power of much value.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Valerianic acid is a powerful relaxant to the nerves and muscles. In

<!-- chunk -->

### large doses or susceptible persons (and cats) it has the opposite property,

<!-- chunk -->

### causing nervousness, restlessness, wakefulness, and twitching followed

<!-- chunk -->

### by drowsiness, sleepiness, lessened sensibility, and relaxation. It has

<!-- chunk -->

### been classified as a stimulant and a depressant, but it is ultimately a

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxant, reducing neuromuscular tension.

<!-- chunk -->

### The fresh root provides the best tincture, preserving the volatile oils. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is more “tonic and less reactive” than preparations from the dried root

<!-- chunk -->

### (Matthew Becker). Small doses are generally relaxing, while large doses

<!-- chunk -->

### are stimulating. However, reaction is idiosyncratic. In some people,

<!-- chunk -->

### valerian produces the symptoms it is supposed to cure: nervousness,

<!-- chunk -->

### irritation, wakefulness, and restlessness. Dosage of the tincture,

<!-- chunk -->

### according to John William Fyfe, is one to sixty drops.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: acrid.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: constriction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: nerves, smooth muscles, large intestine, lower spine.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Pale complexion, cool extremities.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous, irritated, tense, despondent.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous breakdown, nervous fatigue, atrophy from constriction.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Insomnia, wakefulness, nervousness, restlessness, and tension,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially when associated with spinal pain, intestinal spasm, and

<!-- chunk -->

### flatulence.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Lack of concentration, attentiveness, in tense people (one to three

<!-- chunk -->

### drops).

<!-- chunk -->

### • Temporal and frontal headache.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Bronchial spasm; colds, coughs.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Flatulence, colic; spasms and convulsions associated with nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### tension.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Stomach ulcers.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous heart palpitations; high blood pressure; slows and

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthens the heart beat; increases peripheral circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Spasmodic cough, asthma, and dyspnea.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Bladder spasm.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Menstrual spasm, amenorrhea.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Labor; after birth pains.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Lower back spasm.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Convulsions, epilepsy, lack of coordination.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Fever with spasm, measles, scarlet fever.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Arthritis, gout, lack of coordination, paralysis.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Counters the effects of alcohol.

## Verbena hastata (Blue Vervain)

<!-- chunk -->

### Vervain (Verbena officinalis) has a long history of use in European folk

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine and was even a plant of magical repute among the Druids. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has properties similar to the American blue vervain, and the following

<!-- chunk -->

### symptomology obtains for either plant. The vervains are acrid bitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### which in large doses send a chill through the body. Verbena hastata is

<!-- chunk -->

### used to open the skin to bring on sweating when the skin was

<!-- chunk -->

### particularly closed shut, according to LeSassier. Vervain causes intense

<!-- chunk -->

### reactions: intensity of sweat, lack of sweat, intensity of hormonal drives

<!-- chunk -->

### and emotions and ideals.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Bach introduced European vervain as a remedy for extremists who

<!-- chunk -->

### suffer from strong ideals or opinions they wish to thrust upon others,

<!-- chunk -->

### and people who feel driven. (It is perhaps not surprising that it was used

<!-- chunk -->

### in antiquity for protection against psychic attack, a form of over-intense

<!-- chunk -->

### projection upon others). He gives a case history where it solved tension

<!-- chunk -->

### in the neck in a farmer who was highly ambitious. This same portrait

<!-- chunk -->

### applies to the American species.

<!-- chunk -->

### Verbena hastata is indicated in cases where people are intensely driven

<!-- chunk -->

### but do not have the energy to sustain their drive. They often are stiff-

<!-- chunk -->

### necked, metaphorically and literally. They suffer from extreme tension in

<!-- chunk -->

### the neck, yet the neck sometimes weakens and the head drops slightly.

<!-- chunk -->

### These people are often thin and lack the physical sustenance necessary

<!-- chunk -->

### to carry them through the intensity of their work habits and drive. They

<!-- chunk -->

### are constantly exhausted, yet constantly striving. They often try to lay

<!-- chunk -->

### their ideas on other people, as Dr. Bach comments, but just as often they

<!-- chunk -->

### are hard on themselves and don’t accept the faults in themselves or

<!-- chunk -->

### others. The mind is often crowded out with a host of thoughts, which

<!-- chunk -->

### drive them (Karyn Sanders). Dorothy Hall notes that vervain people like

<!-- chunk -->

### to make lists.

<!-- chunk -->

### I remember one thin, tall, idealistic young high school girl suffering

<!-- chunk -->

### from tension and heart palpitations. I asked her if she make lists and she

<!-- chunk -->

### replied that she made lists of other people’s faults! “Yikes, blue vervain

<!-- chunk -->

### run amok,” I thought to myself. After receiving blue vervain, the heart

<!-- chunk -->

### palpitations went away and she evidently relaxed her ideals because

<!-- chunk -->

### within three months, she started her first relationship.

<!-- chunk -->

### The drive found in the vervain or blue vervain person can often be

<!-- chunk -->

### hormonal. It is often a specific for hormonal food craving during

<!-- chunk -->

### menstruation. This was discovered by LeSassier, who also notes that it is

<!-- chunk -->

### a specific for many of the problems occurring in the last half of the

<!-- chunk -->

### cycle, the progesterone half. This is a remedy for what Michael Moore

<!-- chunk -->

### calls “progesterone stress.” Women cannot handle extra progesterone.

<!-- chunk -->

### LeSassier successfully helped one woman who said she felt “like a school

<!-- chunk -->

### of piranhas on a feeding frenzy.” It is suited to PMS women who say

<!-- chunk -->

### they “want to kill somebody.” Blue vervain likes intensity. In my

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, it is the single most important remedy for menopausal hot

<!-- chunk -->

### flashes; blue vervain is suited to intense women with severe sweats. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### a remedy for impotence in men; it also relaxes high ideals and neurotic

<!-- chunk -->

### self-concepts about sex.

<!-- chunk -->

### It terms of Chinese herbalism, blue vervain is a remedy for “yin not

<!-- chunk -->

### holding down the yang,” or a lack of substance and nutrition to support

<!-- chunk -->

### an intense level of activity. These people overdo themselves. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### likewise used for fevers where the profuse sweating was followed by

<!-- chunk -->

### seizures from lack of sustenance. Vervain is an intense, nauseant bitter,

<!-- chunk -->

### easily provoking a shiver from the depths of the body. Thus it reduces

<!-- chunk -->

### tension, shivering, and convulsions. However, it also provokes secretion.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is suited to fevers that simply will not break, where an extremely

<!-- chunk -->

### intense diaphoretic is needed. It is also suited to intense fevers with

<!-- chunk -->

### profuse perspiration followed by seizure, chills, and shivering. It has a

<!-- chunk -->

### reputation for provoking perspiration where other plants cannot open

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin, but it is so bitter it is hard to get down.

<!-- chunk -->

### The roots, leaves, and mature seeds have been used; alternatively, the

<!-- chunk -->

### flower tops are gathered are the height of flowering and extracted fresh

<!-- chunk -->

### in alcohol or dried for use as an infusion. My dose is one to three drops,

<!-- chunk -->

### one to three times per day. More can be used, but this is an extremely

<!-- chunk -->

### bitter plant.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: bitter, acrid.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: constriction, atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: febrifuge; keeps the fluids from drying out; nervine

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxant, antispasmodic, anticonvulsant; hormonal regulator.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Thin, tall, strong-willed, but lacking stamina to sustain effort;

<!-- chunk -->

### overexertion.

<!-- chunk -->

### • High-minded, idealistic, driven, intolerant of shortcomings in self and

<!-- chunk -->

### others; sexual neurosis.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Mental over-activity, excessive thinking, excessive talking, loud voice.

## Literature: Traditional, O. Phelps Brown (7, 8, 10, 11, 21, 22), Edward

<!-- chunk -->

### Bach (2), Matthew Wood (1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 14, 18, 23), Jack Ritchason (5,

<!-- chunk -->

### he terms “tonic” and “dry” are not really adequate for the job

<!-- chunk -->

### here, but we need some simple vocabulary to describe tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### states and their treatment. Atrophy is much better, since it

<!-- chunk -->

### includes dryness (from lack of water or oil), weakness, and wasting or

<!-- chunk -->

### loss of flesh. These are the major symptoms associated with the atrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state. The tongue is usually dry, and in severe cases withered; skin

<!-- chunk -->

### dry; constipation common.

<!-- chunk -->

### The agents needed to treat this condition are diverse. The term “tonic”

<!-- chunk -->

### or even “nutritive tonic” is not very accurate, since there are so many

<!-- chunk -->

### different ways to approach atrophy. Included here are remedies that are

<!-- chunk -->

### moist, mucilaginous, oily, salty, bitter (in some instances), sweet, and

<!-- chunk -->

### “meaty.” The tastes of all the major food groups (sweet, oily, and meaty

<!-- chunk -->

### or proteinaceous) have to be part of the picture. Anything that

<!-- chunk -->

### contributes moisture helps with the feeding of tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### Tissues especially affected by dryness or atrophy include external and

<!-- chunk -->

### internal coverings, i.e., the skin, mucosa, and synovial membranes. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### thus an important influence in muscular and skeletal disease, where the

<!-- chunk -->

### synovial membranes of the joints dry out, in respiratory conditions, and

<!-- chunk -->

### most importantly in gastrointestinal conditions where there is a lack of

<!-- chunk -->

### digestive fluids, poor digestion (hence atrophy), and constipation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mucilage is a thick, moist carbohydrate substance that coats and

<!-- chunk -->

### moistens the tissues. It also tends to penetrate the tissues and cells to

<!-- chunk -->

### bring out toxins. The most important mucilages in Western herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### include Chondrus (Irish moss), Symphytum (comfrey leaf and root), Althea

<!-- chunk -->

### (marshmallow), Plantago (psyllium seed, plantain), and Ulmus fulva

<!-- chunk -->

### (slippery elm). Some of these are also sweet, bitter, or salty, increasing

<!-- chunk -->

### the action on dry, hard, or atrophic tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most commonly used mucilages in Western herbalism are

<!-- chunk -->

### marshmallow, comfrey, and slippery elm. Unfortunately, I tend to use

<!-- chunk -->

### “off brand” mucilages like true and false Solomon’s seal, so I have not

<!-- chunk -->

### chosen to write about comfrey and slippery elm. These really should be

<!-- chunk -->

### studied for inclusion under this tissue state.

<!-- chunk -->

### Water without salt has no intelligence or activity. Salt attracts water

<!-- chunk -->

### and causes it to become active in the tissues. Salty plants such as Althea

<!-- chunk -->

### (marshmallow), Chondrus (Irish moss), and Eryngium (rattlesnake master,

<!-- chunk -->

### sea holly, eryngo) are traditionally used to break up hard swellings; they

<!-- chunk -->

### allow water to penetrate into the tissues. Herbalist David Winston has

<!-- chunk -->

### noted that there is also a “salty/minerally” taste (like the “crispness” of

<!-- chunk -->

### spinach or nettle). This can be applied to Verbascum (mullein),

<!-- chunk -->

### Taraxacum (dandelion leaf), Arctium (burdock root), Urtica (nettles), and

<!-- chunk -->

### Medicago (alfalfa). Herbs high in silicon are also nutritive: Avena sativa

<!-- chunk -->

### (milky oat seed), Equisetum (horsetail), and Agropyron or Eletrigia (couch

<!-- chunk -->

### grass).

<!-- chunk -->

### The third group of medicinal herbs suited to atrophy contain fixed

<!-- chunk -->

### oils. This group is especially prominent in the modern health food store.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most obvious members of the group are Linum (flaxseed oil),

<!-- chunk -->

### Oenotheris (evening primrose oil), Borago (borage), and Sesamum (sesame

<!-- chunk -->

### seed oil). Less widely used oily plants are Juglans cinerea (butternut

<!-- chunk -->

### bark), Angelica, Arctium (burdock), Salvia (garden sage), and Cannabis

<!-- chunk -->

### (marijuana seed). These herbs increase digestion and the metabolism of

<!-- chunk -->

### fats and oils. They provoke the gall bladder, which releases the bile to

<!-- chunk -->

### digest fats and oils, and lubricate the colon. They may provide lipids,

<!-- chunk -->

### which exercise liver metabolism, cellular membrane nutrition, or

<!-- chunk -->

### lipophilic hormone travel. Oils are readily absorbed through the skin and

<!-- chunk -->

### a traditional form of treatment is “fatty inunction” (application of oils to

<!-- chunk -->

### the surface). Fixed oils have a “nutty” taste.

<!-- chunk -->

### The fourth nutritive category is the “sweet tonic.” This class was not

<!-- chunk -->

### developed in Western herbalism; we owe this useful concept to Chinese

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalism. Sweet herbs contain sugars and starches that increase

<!-- chunk -->

### carbohydrate digestion and metabolism. The cells and tissues are thus

<!-- chunk -->

### nourished and build up. Nourished tissues are able to retain more water,

<!-- chunk -->

### so sweet herbs reduce dryness (and sometimes even heat or wind). Sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### native or imported herbs used in Western herbalism include Myrrhis

<!-- chunk -->

### odorata (European sweet cicely), Osmorrhiza longistylus (American sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### cicely), Panax quinquifolius (American ginseng), Arctium (burdock root),

<!-- chunk -->

### Taraxacum (dandelion root), Avena sativa (milky oat seed), Agropyron

<!-- chunk -->

### (couch grass), Galium (cleavers), Trifolium (red clover), Glycyrrhiza

<!-- chunk -->

### (licorice), Rehmannia, Codonopsis, and Astragalus.

<!-- chunk -->

### Moist, mucilaginous, salty, oily, and sweet herbs can all reduce heat

<!-- chunk -->

### by increasing the fluids. Some of them, like marshmallow, are seldom

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated unless there is heat conjoined with dryness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another “flavor” which may be included here is “meaty.” This flavor is

<!-- chunk -->

### recognized in Japanese cooking. Foods high in protein taste “meaty.” In

<!-- chunk -->

### the vegetable world, this includes Urtica (nettle) and the mushrooms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The latter are more closely akin to animals than plants, which

<!-- chunk -->

### incidentally, they feed off. Most mushrooms are nutritive and tonic in

<!-- chunk -->

### effect, for example, Ganoderma (reishi).

<!-- chunk -->

### Atrophy bears an interesting relationship to the opposite category,

<!-- chunk -->

### torpor or stagnation. Since water is the means of transportation in the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, both a lack of water (atrophy) and a stagnation (torpor) can stop

<!-- chunk -->

### the transportation of foodstuffs, waste products, and water. Therefore,

<!-- chunk -->

### both tissue states are associated with weak, undernourished tissue,

<!-- chunk -->

### accumulation of toxic material, and pockets of water. Both respond to

<!-- chunk -->

### bitters and alteratives. In atrophy, these symptoms will appear against

<!-- chunk -->

### an emaciated, withered background, while in torpor they appear in

<!-- chunk -->

### association with a swollen, boggy, expressionless tissue state. Both

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions trap toxins in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Both the atrophic and the torpid tissue states respond to bitter herbs

<!-- chunk -->

### and alteratives. Since digestion and metabolism is dependent on

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion, bitters can improve digestion and tissue nutrition to relieve

<!-- chunk -->

### atrophy. Some of the bitters which act especially on atrophy are Alnus

<!-- chunk -->

### (alder), Arctium (burdock), Lycopodium (wolf’s paw club moss), Panax

<!-- chunk -->

### quinquifolius (American ginseng), and Berberis aquifolium (Oregon grape

<!-- chunk -->

### root). Some of these are also cited as alteratives that remove torpor.

<!-- chunk -->

### Thurston defined remedies for the atrophic condition as

<!-- chunk -->

### “trophorestoratives.” He applied this term to many plants with a strong

<!-- chunk -->

### organ affinity because they rebuilt the “trophism” of the organ. I do not

<!-- chunk -->

### believe this is the correct way to define remedies for atrophy. I consider

<!-- chunk -->

### the appropriate agents to be those that build fluids (water and oil),

<!-- chunk -->

### increase nutrition, hold water, and soften hardness.

## Althea officinalis (Marshmallow)

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow is one of the central mucilages in the Western

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmacopoeia. It is also somewhat salty, so it not only restores

<!-- chunk -->

### lubrication, it also leads water into hardened, dried out tissue. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated when dryness is combined with heat. The tongue is usually

<!-- chunk -->

### dried and red, with hardening and sometimes cracking of the surface. A

<!-- chunk -->

### slightly reddish complexion seems to be typical. Sometimes there is

<!-- chunk -->

### noticeable drying and exfoliation of the cuticle.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow has been used since the most ancient times. The name

<!-- chunk -->

### althea derives from the Greek for “heal all.” Hippocrates used a

<!-- chunk -->

### decoction of the roots externally (with honey and rosin) to stop bleeding

<!-- chunk -->

### and internally to moisten and nourish when there was severe blood loss.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is native to salt marshes in Europe, but naturalized in low ground in

<!-- chunk -->

### coastal and inland North America. Of all mucilages, it is considered the

<!-- chunk -->

### most softening (Palaiseul, 1974, 178), and diuretic (Ellingwood, 1919,

<!-- chunk -->

### 431). The roots, leaves, flowers, and seeds are used somewhat

<!-- chunk -->

### interchangeably, both internally and externally. They soothe

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation of the skin and mucosa.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow root syrup is a major remedy for irritable coughs. It

<!-- chunk -->

### soothes the passageways, and reduces inflammation and dryness. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### also beneficial in continuous runny colds. (Perhaps, like red clover, it

<!-- chunk -->

### breaks up cysts in the sinuses that often cause this condition). It is “of

<!-- chunk -->

### value in inflammation of the fauces and tonsils, and in coughs and

<!-- chunk -->

### hoarseness its soothing influence has been found useful” (Fyfe, 1909,

<!-- chunk -->

### 362).

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow is used for canker sores, dental abscesses, gingivitis,

<!-- chunk -->

### laryngitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, gastritis, enteritis, colitis, inflammation

<!-- chunk -->

### of the kidneys, and cystitis. In my experience, it is indispensable in

<!-- chunk -->

### colitis and Crohn’s disease, but it usually only palliates and patients need

<!-- chunk -->

### more specific treatment. It is used as a softening, moistening lubricant to

<!-- chunk -->

### open the constipated intestine (when due to dryness). Like slippery elm,

<!-- chunk -->

### it has been used to lubricate the passages to procure an easier birth. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritive, it is used to increase milk production.

<!-- chunk -->

### Externally, marshmallow is used on dry, scruffy, skin, dandruff, dry

<!-- chunk -->

### scabs on the scalp, unhealthy scalp with hair loss, and insect bites. A

<!-- chunk -->

### woman came to me with a red, dry patch on the face that was not

<!-- chunk -->

### cancerous. She had a reddish complexion generally, lower back pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### and a broad, red, dry, cracked tongue with some carmine red, showing

<!-- chunk -->

### damaged fluids and heat. Two marshmallow capsules, three times a day,

<!-- chunk -->

### cured in a few weeks.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow breaks up swollen breast glands, ducts, and cysts. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### laid on the eyes, to take away redness and swelling. It is used externally

<!-- chunk -->

### to dissipate hard swellings, inflammations, boils, abscesses, and cysts. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is placed over a swollen, hard liver or spleen. A poultice draws out

<!-- chunk -->

### thorns and splinter. Marshmallow is used externally on bruises, bones

<!-- chunk -->

### out of joint, swollen joints, muscles, tendons, and arteries.

<!-- chunk -->

### The root in capsule form is a good medium for use in intestinal

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, since the swallowed capsule gets down to the stomach. It

<!-- chunk -->

### lubricates the stool and eases constipation. Although commonly used for

<!-- chunk -->

### constipation, it can also be used for diarrhea and dysentery where

<!-- chunk -->

### soothing and cooling is needed. Culpeper (1652, 180) treats us to a case

<!-- chunk -->

### history. “You may remember, that not long since there was a raging

<!-- chunk -->

### disease called the bloody-flux [dysentery]; the college of physicians not

<!-- chunk -->

### knowing what to make of it, called it the inside plague, for their wits

<!-- chunk -->

### were at Ne plus nultra about it. My son was taken with the same disease,

<!-- chunk -->

### and the excoriation of the bowels was exceeding great; myself being in

<!-- chunk -->

### the country, was sent for up; the only thing I gave him, was Mallows

<!-- chunk -->

### bruised and boiled both in milk and drink.” He was cured in two days.

<!-- chunk -->

### And here the grateful father writes, “And here I show my thankfulness to

<!-- chunk -->

### God in communicating it to his creatures, leave it to posterity.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow root is useful to soothe the parts in the passage of both

<!-- chunk -->

### kidney and gall stones. It is especially indicated when the parts are dry,

<!-- chunk -->

### inflamed, and sensitive. Phyllis Light recommends marshmallow root, or

<!-- chunk -->

### its cousin okra root, to soothe the gall bladder, increase fluids, loosen up

<!-- chunk -->

### the stones hard and dried in the gall sac, soothe the ducts, and help with

<!-- chunk -->

### their passage.

<!-- chunk -->

### Marshmallow is extracted best in water rather than alcohol. Cold

<!-- chunk -->

### water picks up the mucilage but not as much of the starch, while hot

<!-- chunk -->

### water picks up the starch but not the mucilage. Capsules are convenient.

<!-- chunk -->

### The flowers, leaves, and roots are all used interchangeably. A number of

<!-- chunk -->

### cousins are used as a substitute. Extracts poorly in water and alcohol, so

<!-- chunk -->

### it is often used in capsules or tablets.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (root) salty, sweet, cool, mucilaginous.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: atrophy and irritation dependent on lack of moisture.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: skin and mucosa, upper gastrointestinal tract, kidneys.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Lips red, dry, sometimes with a slight white powder around them.

## Asclepias tuberosa (Pleurisy Root, Butterfly Weed)

<!-- chunk -->

### Pleurisy root is a cousin of milkweed. It was used by the earliest colonial

<!-- chunk -->

### root doctors of whom we have record. It was popular in the nineteenth

<!-- chunk -->

### century as a diaphoretic and moistener. The physiomedicalists—Curtis,

<!-- chunk -->

### Cook, Thurston—considered it to be the archetypal remedy for the

<!-- chunk -->

### excitation tissue state. After a long period of study, I decided that it

<!-- chunk -->

### worked on fevers because it was lubricating, moistening, and opened the

<!-- chunk -->

### pores, not because it was a sedative that reduced heat directly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Therefore, I placed it under the tonics. It is not really that widely useful

<!-- chunk -->

### today, but it is an interesting remedy and I thought a short account

<!-- chunk -->

### would be appropriate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Pleurisy root is a sweet, nutritive herb that increases fluids in the

<!-- chunk -->

### internal membranes and passages, so that diaphoresis to the surface will

<!-- chunk -->

### be complete and healthy. Although it was one of the most important

<!-- chunk -->

### agents in the nineteenth-century materia medica of professional and lay

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine, pleurisy root is less often called for or used at the present

<!-- chunk -->

### time. The roots have little round structures that look astonishingly like

<!-- chunk -->

### alveoli. It is a specific for old pleuritic stitches, rather than recent cases

<!-- chunk -->

### of acute pleurisy (for that, use homeopathic Bryonia). It also lubricates

<!-- chunk -->

### the intestines.

<!-- chunk -->

### Asclepias is indicated when the skin and synovial membranes (bursa,

<!-- chunk -->

### pleura) are dry or the pores are closed, trapping fluids in the

<!-- chunk -->

### membranes. By increasing fluids, it reduces heat and constriction, or a

<!-- chunk -->

### sense of stuffiness in the chest. It can prevent inflammation of the pleura

<!-- chunk -->

### from going into pneumonia, which is a frequent event, and also cures the

<!-- chunk -->

### pleuritic stitches left behind after an old case of bronchitis or pneumonia

<!-- chunk -->

### has damaged the pleura.

<!-- chunk -->

### My friend Jennifer Tucker, an experienced herbalist in State College,

<!-- chunk -->

### Pennsylvania, put this information to work when she had a frozen

<!-- chunk -->

### shoulder. Little motion was left in the left shoulder. “It looks like an old,

<!-- chunk -->

### advanced scoliosis,” said the physical therapist. She was in the waiting

<!-- chunk -->

### room reading my book when she got to the part about Asclepias tuberosa

<!-- chunk -->

### and joints. She knew it was the right remedy. “I’m afraid we may have

<!-- chunk -->

### to do surgery,” said the physical therapist. “We’re not making any

<!-- chunk -->

### progress.” “Oh no,” replied Jennifer. “You wait. I know what plant to

<!-- chunk -->

### cure it with now.” She went home, dug up a plant in her field (which

<!-- chunk -->

### has some of the best pleurisy root I’ve ever seen), and started chewing it.

<!-- chunk -->

### Even on the first day, motion was increased twenty per cent. Now the

<!-- chunk -->

### physical therapy exercises worked. In sixty days, to the pleasant surprise

<!-- chunk -->

### of the physical therapist, she had normal range of motion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Now, one would never know she’d had a problem.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: slightly sweet, salty, and minerally/salty.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue States: atrophy, constriction, irritation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: skin and mucosal synovial membranes.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Dry skin, with stuffiness in the chest.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Cough, dry in the throat and upper lungs, but wet in the lower

<!-- chunk -->

### reaches of the lungs.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Chronic pleurisy following old cases of bronchitis and pneumonia,

<!-- chunk -->

### rather than acute pleurisy (for which homeopathic Bryonia is usually

<!-- chunk -->

### sufficient); sharp, stitching pains in the chest; pain in the chest from

### coughing.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Pneumonia with water in the bottom of the lungs.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Asthma with oppressed breathing and pulse.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Acute bursitis and arthritis with redness, swelling, tenderness, pain,

<!-- chunk -->

### and lack of perspiration.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Old cases of bursitis and arthritis with adhesions in the joints that

## Avena sativa (Milky Oat Seed)

<!-- chunk -->

### Oat seed picked in the milky stage is a beautiful, moistening, sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy. It is a very important tonic remedy for the nervous system

<!-- chunk -->

### depleted by stress, prolonged illness, sexual excesses, drug use, or

<!-- chunk -->

### protracted illness. It is high in silicon, like all the grasses, and thus

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthens the connective tissue, skin, mucosa, and nerves. Oat grass is

<!-- chunk -->

### higher in silica, which makes it strengthening to the connective tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oats are widely used as a tonic for nervous debility and nervousness

<!-- chunk -->

### by contemporary practitioners. This is not a remedy I use a great deal,

<!-- chunk -->

### and I cannot offer personal insights, but it should be included under any

<!-- chunk -->

### good survey of sweet tonics for dryness and atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

### The seed is collected in the milky stage, before maturity, and dried or

<!-- chunk -->

### tinctured fresh. Standard dose of the tincture with the old physicians is

<!-- chunk -->

### five to sixty drops, three times per day. Oats are strengthening to thin

<!-- chunk -->

### people (sympathetic dominance), but fattening to those who are thick

<!-- chunk -->

### (parasympathetic dominance).

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (milky seed) sweet, moist.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue States: atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: nerves (sympathetic excess), skin, nails, hair,

<!-- chunk -->

### connective tissue.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous prostration, debility, weakness, paralysis (neurasthenia).

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous system exhausted, all played out, drained; from stress,

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive duties, drug use, prolonged illness, sexual excess.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Inability to keep the mind fixed on any one subject; lack of focus,

<!-- chunk -->

### concentration, and memory; vagary of thought and manner.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous prostration following mental strain.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Insomnia associated with nervous exhaustion, despondency.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Occipital headache extending down the spine and into the lower

<!-- chunk -->

### extremities, associated with neurasthenia; with burning sensation on

<!-- chunk -->

### top of the head.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Paralysis of the throat in diphtheria.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nervous palpitations.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Bedwetting, nocturnal emissions; with weakness.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Emissions of phosphates and other white substances in the urine; with

## Verbascum thapsus (Mullein)

<!-- chunk -->

### Mullein is a member of the scrophularia family, long associated with

<!-- chunk -->

### scrofula (swollen glands). However, it is best known as a respiratory

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy. It is particularly used for irritable, dry coughs, but it is also for

<!-- chunk -->

### dry/atrophy of the lymphatic system with poor absorption through the

<!-- chunk -->

### small intestine and weakness in the lymphatics. Although generally

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated when the mucosa are dry, mullein will also remove deposits of

<!-- chunk -->

### water dependent on weak tissue states. It promotes absorption in cellular

<!-- chunk -->

### dropsy, chronic abscesses, pleuritic effusions, and similar accumulations

<!-- chunk -->

### of fluid (Cook). It lubricates around bones, and helps set bones and

<!-- chunk -->

### straighten vertebra. Sedative to inflamed and irritated nerves, sharp

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mullein is a very important remedy for muscular and skeletal

<!-- chunk -->

### problems, though it is not apt to appear on the top of anyone’s list. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated in dry/atrophic conditions of the mucosa. It has a moistening,

<!-- chunk -->

### lubricating effect on the synovial membranes as well, so that it is

<!-- chunk -->

### hydrating to the spine and joints. It is often indicated in back injuries.

<!-- chunk -->

### People think back injuries are untreatable and incurable, but increase in

<!-- chunk -->

### the synovial fluids will make the spine more pliable and comfortable.

<!-- chunk -->

### The vertebra will slip back into place more readily, pain and

<!-- chunk -->

### inflammation will decrease, and the condition will get better. Mullein

<!-- chunk -->

### also has a rather unbelievable ability to set bones in the right place

<!-- chunk -->

### when they have been broken or are out of place. I have seen this several

<!-- chunk -->

### times. It will set a broken rib or digit, getting it back into place quickly. I

<!-- chunk -->

### remember watching it visibly dampen around the coffin bone of a horse

<!-- chunk -->

### as I placed it on the manure covered hoof. The leaves are picked during

<!-- chunk -->

### the first season; the flowers at the end of the second.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (leaf) salty/minerally.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: respiratory tract, lymphatics, synovial fluids, bones.


<!-- chunk -->

### • General dryness and atrophy.

## Polygonatum spp. (True Solomon’s seal)

<!-- chunk -->

### True Solomon’s seal is an extraordinary medicine for the muscular and

<!-- chunk -->

### skeletal system, probably the most important remedy for this system I

<!-- chunk -->

### have ever encountered. It is suited to a wide range of problems affecting

<!-- chunk -->

### the joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. It tightens or loosens

<!-- chunk -->

### tendons and attachments (depending on which is needed), strengthens

<!-- chunk -->

### and repairs joint damage, soothes or even cures many kinds of arthritis

<!-- chunk -->

### in the joints, and works nicely with repetitive-injury problems such as

<!-- chunk -->

### tennis elbow, jogger’s knee, and carpal-tunnel syndrome. True Solomon’s

<!-- chunk -->

### seal is moist, sweet, and slightly acrid, so it is suited to dry/atrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### conditions affecting the tension-bearing structures.

<!-- chunk -->

### John Gerard originally introduced true Solomon’s seal into English

<!-- chunk -->

### language herbal medicine in 1597. The old Greek and Roman authors

<!-- chunk -->

### dismissed it as a poisonous plant. However, only the blue-black berries

<!-- chunk -->

### are toxic; the roots are sweet, edible, and medicinal.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Galen saith, that neither herbe nor root hereof is to be given

<!-- chunk -->

### inwardly,” Gerard comments (1635, 905). “But note what experience

<!-- chunk -->

### hath found out, and of late dayes, especially among the vulgar sort of

<!-- chunk -->

### people in Hampshire, which Galen, Dioscorides, or any other that have

<!-- chunk -->

### written of plants have not so much as dreamed of.” These clever folk-

<!-- chunk -->

### healers used Solomon’s seal extensively. “If any of what sex or age

<!-- chunk -->

### soever chance to have any bones broken, in what part of their bodies

<!-- chunk -->

### soever; their refuge is to stampe the roots hereof, and give it unto the

<!-- chunk -->

### patient in ale to drinke: which sodoreth and glues together the bones in

<!-- chunk -->

### very short space, and very strangely, yea although the bones be but

<!-- chunk -->

### slenderly and unhandsomely placed and wrapped up. Moreover, the said

<!-- chunk -->

### people do give it in like manner unto their cattell, if they chance to have

<!-- chunk -->

### any bones broken.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Gerard reports several other valuable uses. “The root stamped and

<!-- chunk -->

### applied in manner of a pultesse, and layd upon members that have been

<!-- chunk -->

### out of ioynt, and newly restored to their places, driveth away the paine,

<!-- chunk -->

### and knitteth the ioynt very firmely, and taketh away the inflammation, if

<!-- chunk -->

### there chance to be any.” It is also beneficial for bruises. “The root of

<!-- chunk -->

### Solomon’s seale stamped while it is fresh and greene, and applied taketh

<!-- chunk -->

### away in one night, or two at the most, any bruise, black or blew spots

<!-- chunk -->

### gotten by falls.” It is also good for internal bruises. The root stamped and

<!-- chunk -->

### the juice drunk, “helps any inward bruise, disperseth the congealed and

<!-- chunk -->

### clotted bloud in very short space.” This will be beneficial during healing

<!-- chunk -->

### from a broken bone, which is usually surrounded by congealed blood. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is beneficial for many of the complications associated with broken bones.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is used “against inflammation, tumors, or swellings that happen unto

<!-- chunk -->

### members whose bones are broken, or members out of ioynt, after

<!-- chunk -->

### restaruration.”

<!-- chunk -->

### “That which might be written of this herbe … would seeme unto some

<!-- chunk -->

### incredible,” he continues. “But common experience teacheth, that in the

<!-- chunk -->

### world is not to be found another herbe comparable to it.” My own

<!-- chunk -->

### experience validates these comments.

<!-- chunk -->

### Solomon’s seal is one of those plants which demonstrates the truth of

<!-- chunk -->

### that oft-ridiculed idea, the doctrine of signatures. The white roots look

<!-- chunk -->

### like bones, joints, knuckles, and vertebra. When dry, they look even

<!-- chunk -->

### more like a bone, because the outside covering and the inside begin to

<!-- chunk -->

### look different, like the periosteum covering the bone. Then there are

<!-- chunk -->

### little spurs. These suggest an affinity to bone spurs. Solomon’s seal

<!-- chunk -->

### usually cures spurs and bunions by correcting the tension on the muscles

<!-- chunk -->

### and tendons, which cause malformation of the bones. It decalcifies, as

<!-- chunk -->

### needed by the body, breaking down spurs and deposits, yet it also

<!-- chunk -->

### recalcifies, building up and repairing bones. Most white roots contain or

<!-- chunk -->

### act on calcium. One of my students, a polarity therapist, noticed the way

<!-- chunk -->

### the leaves fold around the stems. They resemble the way muscles fold

<!-- chunk -->

### around and attach to bones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Solomon’s seal is the superlative remedy for tightening or loosening

<!-- chunk -->

### tendons, ligaments, and muscles. It adjusts to the right tension. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### useful for ligamentous looseness, where the ligaments are stretched and

<!-- chunk -->

### don’t hold after an adjustment. I helped one fellow who had a ligament

<!-- chunk -->

### in his foot that was stretched an inch too long. The doctors wanted to

<!-- chunk -->

### cut out a piece and sew it back together, but Solomon’s seal tincture

<!-- chunk -->

### rubbed into the area corrected the problem in about a week. A

<!-- chunk -->

### veterinarian was stiff and arthritic because of old football injuries when

<!-- chunk -->

### he was a cornerback at Ohio State. He had suffered from broken bones, a

<!-- chunk -->

### torn shoulder joint, calcification, stiffness, and arthritic pain all over the

<!-- chunk -->

### place. Solomon’s seal cleared out the majority of the problems in a

<!-- chunk -->

### month. It is great for young athletes (and old athletes), not only because

<!-- chunk -->

### it corrects so many muscular and skeletal problems, but because it

<!-- chunk -->

### adjusts to the right tension, thus avoiding injuries and off periods. As

<!-- chunk -->

### Gerard points out, it is good for spinal problems because it helps get the

<!-- chunk -->

### bones in the right places. Solomon’s seal is the great medicine for

<!-- chunk -->

### arthritis in the joints, while black cohosh and teasel are for rheumatic

<!-- chunk -->

### pains in the muscles. Although it will not al ways cure, it will almost

<!-- chunk -->

### always palliate and remove pain, even in rheumatoid arthritis. It is a

<!-- chunk -->

### good remedy for hip dysplasia in dogs, as I have seen from experience.

<!-- chunk -->

### Solomon’s seal is nearly foolproof for repetitive use tendonitis (and if

<!-- chunk -->

### it fails, we still have other remedies such as homeopathic Rhus

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicodendron or comfrey poultices). One of my students worked in a

<!-- chunk -->

### jewelry-making factory. One Christmas she made Solomon’s seal salve

<!-- chunk -->

### and brought jars for everyone as presents for her coworkers because they

<!-- chunk -->

### suffered from repetitive-use injuries. It cured all twenty-plus people and

<!-- chunk -->

### they started using it for arthritis on themselves and their relatives. That’s

<!-- chunk -->

### how we learned about its properties as an arthritic medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### William Salmon (1710, 1045) gives some additional information.

<!-- chunk -->

### “Taken at a time morning and evening … is said to cure ruptures when

<!-- chunk -->

### the guts fall into the cods, a cataplasm of the root being applyed

<!-- chunk -->

### outwardly.” The macerated roots in wheat or rye meal are applied

<!-- chunk -->

### outwardly to seal green wounds and “strengthen a weak back.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The rhizomes are the useful part. They are so sweet they turn a sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### alcohol sticky and should be made up in grain alcohol or oil. The berries

<!-- chunk -->

### are toxic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: sweet, bitter, cool, moist.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: tendons, mucosa.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Characteristic symptoms: stretched or loose tendons and ligaments.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Muscular and skeletal tensions, bones spurs resulting from such

<!-- chunk -->

### tensions.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Repetitive use injury; carpal tunnel syndrome; arthritis associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with old injuries, calcifications, muscular, and skeletal tensions.

<!-- chunk -->

<!-- chunk -->

## Galium aparine (Cleavers, Lady’s Bedstraw)

<!-- chunk -->

### Cleavers is native to the Old World, but widely naturalized in the New. It

<!-- chunk -->

### has long been used in folk medicine. I wrote about it in The Book of

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbal Wisdom, so my remarks will be brief, but I will add some

<!-- chunk -->

### additional information here as I have learned new indications with the

<!-- chunk -->

### passage of time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Picked before going to seed, it is moist, sweet, and salty. The sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### flavor is from coumarins, so it thins the blood and aerates the tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### When there is atrophy with fibrous deposits in the tissues, the moisture

<!-- chunk -->

### and saltiness indicate this remedy. It has strong affinities to the

<!-- chunk -->

### lymphatic system, kidneys, and nervous system. It is suited to lymphatic

<!-- chunk -->

### congestion and stagnation, swollen glands, under and about the ears,

<!-- chunk -->

### and after infections. It dissolves calcareous deposits in the tissues,

<!-- chunk -->

### sweeps fluids and solids down to the kidneys, and helps remove them. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is beneficial in “gatherings of the nerves” and inflammation of the nerve

<!-- chunk -->

### endings (neurofibrositis). It is one of the few lymphatic remedies with an

<!-- chunk -->

### affinity for the vata constitution, but it helps people large and small. It

<!-- chunk -->

### should be considered in neurological diseases, over-sensitivity of the

<!-- chunk -->

### nerve endings, tickling, and itchy skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### Based on the doctrine of signatures (swollen bulbs at the end of the

<!-- chunk -->

### long stalk), I once gave this plant to a young girl suffering from

<!-- chunk -->

### neurofibromatosis (Elephant man’s disease). The bulbs of the nerves

<!-- chunk -->

### were inflamed, producing an outbreak of round, reddened spots on the

<!-- chunk -->

### forearms and elsewhere. The spots lessened almost immediately as we

<!-- chunk -->

### put cleavers on the skin. Unfortunately, I never heard back from this

<!-- chunk -->

### case, as I was on traveling at the time. However, I was reminded of it

<!-- chunk -->

### when I was consulted to treat a case of Morton’s neuroma, a painful

<!-- chunk -->

### ganglion-like nerve swelling on the underside of the foot near the second

<!-- chunk -->

### toe. It was not the neuroma that joggled my memory, but the “eczema”

<!-- chunk -->

### on the forearm. It looked like scattered red bumps resembling the

<!-- chunk -->

### neurofibroma on the arm of the young girl. “I control that with

<!-- chunk -->

### cortisone, so my patients don’t see it,” said the woman, a very good

<!-- chunk -->

### acupuncturist. She was not looking for a cure for that, but when we tried

<!-- chunk -->

### some cleavers, the neuroma on her foot started feeling better. “It made a

<!-- chunk -->

### huge difference, even the next day,” said my patient. We had tried Ruta

<!-- chunk -->

### and Smilacina with slight pain relief for several months. The eczema also

<!-- chunk -->

### improved.

<!-- chunk -->

### My acupuncturist friend was very precise about the areas where the

<!-- chunk -->

### eczema broke out, and her observations have a bearing on the utility of

<!-- chunk -->

### cleavers. “It broke out wherever there is a lot of muscular and ligament

<!-- chunk -->

### stress. On the forearm, the shoulder and the scapula, around GB 20. Also

<!-- chunk -->

### on the hips, down the gall bladder channel on the thigh. The neuroma

<!-- chunk -->

### was near the junction of the gall bladder and stomach channels.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Later I found that cleavers works on the analogous tendons in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hand, under the middle finger on the palm. There can be a thinning of

<!-- chunk -->

### flesh, a gathering together of tendons, and lack of mobility. This is

<!-- chunk -->

### usually diagnosed as Duputreyan’s contractures. Another practitioner

<!-- chunk -->

### called this “flexor tendon nodules.” The most holistic explanation came

<!-- chunk -->

### from a polarity therapist, who noted that the gathered tendons were

<!-- chunk -->

### under the middle or fire finger or toe, indicating a “fire problem.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Cleavers should be collected in the spring and early summer before

<!-- chunk -->

### the seeds appear, and when it still tastes like vanilla. It must be prepared

<!-- chunk -->

### or used fresh. My dose is small—one to three drops, one to three times

<!-- chunk -->

### per day—but it certainly can be used in moderate and large doses. In

<!-- chunk -->

### long-term build up of fibrous tissue, this remedy may need to be

<!-- chunk -->

### persisted in for a year or longer, though immediate results will be

<!-- chunk -->

### evident.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: sweet, salty/minerally, cool, moist.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: atrophy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: nerves, lymphatic system, kidneys.

<!-- chunk -->

### he term “relaxation” was applied in old-time medicine as far back

<!-- chunk -->

### as Hippocrates to any condition where the tissues could not hold

<!-- chunk -->

### on to fluids and thus flowed away. This would include excessive

<!-- chunk -->

### sweating, salivation, digestive secretion, diarrhea, menstrual bleeding,

<!-- chunk -->

### and urination. Another term we sometimes find in the old literature is

<!-- chunk -->

### “free secretion.” In addition, the tissues are usually flaccid, atonic, or

<!-- chunk -->

### prolapsed. One variation is “passive venous congestion,” where the

<!-- chunk -->

### vasculature is relaxed, the blood collects in the veins, and there are

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of high blood pressure, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, dilatation

<!-- chunk -->

### of the right side of the heart, congestion of the liver and lungs. Chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes mellitus often creates a relaxed condition with loss of fluids via

<!-- chunk -->

### the kidneys and the skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### In traditional Western herbalism, astringents have always treated this

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state. Dr. Edward Shook (1978, 87, 115) explains, “nearly all

<!-- chunk -->

### astringents coagulate albumin, tone up relaxed or debilitated condition

<!-- chunk -->

### of muscular fiber, contract both arterioles and capillaries, restrain

<!-- chunk -->

### peristalsis, contract gland ducts, and repress excessive secretions.” Even

<!-- chunk -->

### diabetes will respond to astringents, if the case is characterized by free

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion of fluids.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of the ironies of the relaxed tissue state is that it tends to create a

<!-- chunk -->

### deep tension, which can be either psychological or physical, or both. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with high blood pressure in some cases. This probably occurs

<!-- chunk -->

### because fluid loss is associated with potassium depletion and sodium

<!-- chunk -->

### buildup.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most prominent astringent herbs are Rubus spp. (raspberry,

<!-- chunk -->

### blackberry), Rhus spp. (sumach bark), Hamamelis (witch hazel),

<!-- chunk -->

### Geranium spp. (wild geranium, herb robert), Quercus spp. (white oak

<!-- chunk -->

### bark), Osmunda regalis (royal fern), Salvia spp. (sage), Tsuga canadensis

<!-- chunk -->

### (Canadian hemlock), Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut), Collinsonia

<!-- chunk -->

### (stone root), and Myrica cerifera (bayberry bark). The last five are

<!-- chunk -->

### warming, stimulating astringents.

<!-- chunk -->

### Excessive use of astringents can impair mineral absorption. Astringents

<!-- chunk -->

### bind with alkalis. However, as a remedy, they help retain minerals.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are a number of anomalous remedies that stop fluid loss by

<!-- chunk -->

### increasing nutrition or stimulating the tissues. This includes Monarda

<!-- chunk -->

### fistulosa (sweet leaf), Astragalus, and Foeniculum (fennel). They do not fit

<!-- chunk -->

### this tissue state.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rubus villosa (Blackberry)

<!-- chunk -->

### Blackberry is the standard old-time remedy for simple, uncomplicated

<!-- chunk -->

### diarrhea due to “relaxation of the bowels.” The leaf, fruit, or root may be

<!-- chunk -->

### used. It is sweet, sour, cool, and astringent, so it sedates heat and tones

<!-- chunk -->

### the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, improving digestion, absorption,

<!-- chunk -->

### and nutrition. If it is not available, use raspberry leaf in its place.

<!-- chunk -->

### Blackberry “is especially indicated when there is evidence of

<!-- chunk -->

### relaxation and enfeeblement of the mucous coats of the stomach and

<!-- chunk -->

### bowels, and the discharges are large, watery, and clay-colored.” It is also

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated in “passive hemorrhage from the stomach, bowels, or uterus”

<!-- chunk -->

### (Fyfe, 1909). Blackberry leaf tea was Dr. V. G. Rocine’s favorite medicine

<!-- chunk -->

### for “prolapse” of the stomach.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Wooster Beach (1842, 670) preserved an interesting anecdote from

<!-- chunk -->

### upstate New York about blackberry. “It is a medicine much used by

<!-- chunk -->

### Indians in dysentery; and it is said that, in the Oneida tribe, five hundred

<!-- chunk -->

### were attacked with this diseases in one season, and, by the use of the

<!-- chunk -->

### blackberry root, all recovered, while their neighbors, the whites, fell

<!-- chunk -->

### before the disease; no doubt in consequence of taking mercury, or some

<!-- chunk -->

### of the common agents made use of.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Rhus typhina, R. aromatica, R. coriara (Sumach)

<!-- chunk -->

### Sumach (R. coriara) has a long history of use in Greek and Arabic

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine. It was largely forgotten at the time of American settlement

<!-- chunk -->

### and the use of the native species were picked up from the Indians.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fragrant sumach (R. aromatica) and smooth sumach (R. glabra) were

<!-- chunk -->

### officinal in the nineteenth century, but staghorn sumach (R. typhina) has

<!-- chunk -->

### been used in folk medicine. The symptoms are relatively interchangeable

<!-- chunk -->

### but R. glabra seems to have more putrefaction. I use R. typhina because it

<!-- chunk -->

### grows in my neighborhood and has the beautiful antler-like branches of

<!-- chunk -->

### an “elk medicine.” The bark is astringent while the berries are sour and

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent. Herbalist Glenda Croft, of Wagga Wagga, Australia, uses the

<!-- chunk -->

### ground berries and bark of the Old World sumach, which is widely

<!-- chunk -->

### available as a condiment.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalist Phyllis Light has developed a constitutional picture of the

<!-- chunk -->

### sumach person, based on traditional Appalachian usage in her region,

<!-- chunk -->

### and through personal experience. The person is usually thin, weak,

<!-- chunk -->

### lethargic, lacking in will, codependent, with weak kidneys, dark circles

<!-- chunk -->

### under the eyes, anemia (poor blood) from renal insufficiency (kidneys

<!-- chunk -->

### not signaling the marrow), low immunity (also from bone marrow

<!-- chunk -->

### weakness), with fluid loss. Kidneys are relaxed, exhausted, not able to

<!-- chunk -->

### remove fluids (edema), or not able to retain filtered urine. A

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic symptom is frequent urination associated with weakness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fluid loss after a period of fever. Also indicated when other fluids are

<!-- chunk -->

### not being retained, hence in impotence, nocturnal emissions, clear

<!-- chunk -->

### vaginal discharge, dribbling of urine, excessive blood loss from the

<!-- chunk -->

### kidneys, uterus, bowels, stomach, or lungs, with excessive expectoration.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. J. T. McClanahan, of Booneville, Missouri, introduced fragrant

<!-- chunk -->

### sumach (Rhus aromatica) in 1879 as a remedy for urinary incontinence

<!-- chunk -->

### and excessive urination. It became an officinal remedy in nineteenth-

<!-- chunk -->

### century medicine. The leaves and bark of the fragrant sumach are

<!-- chunk -->

### beneficial for both diabetes insipidus and mellitus. I have several times

<!-- chunk -->

### used staghorn sumach with the same results associated with its aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

### cousin—diminished perspiration and urination and return of blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### to a stable level.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. I. J. M. Goss (1885, 124) learned about Rhus aromatica for diabetes

<!-- chunk -->

### from Dr. McClanahan. An old man who had what we would now call

<!-- chunk -->

### type II diabetes approached him. He was very weak, and was passing

<!-- chunk -->

### large quantities of urine filled with sugar. “I put this old gentleman upon

<!-- chunk -->

### the lycopus and nitrate of uranium, which treatment he continued for

<!-- chunk -->

### one month, and which reduced the quantity of urine, but not the

<!-- chunk -->

### quantity of sugar.” Goss then put him on Rhus aromatica, thirty drops,

<!-- chunk -->

### three times a day. This decreased both urine and sugar. After two

<!-- chunk -->

### months, “he reported himself perfectly well, and so continues up to last

<!-- chunk -->

### accounts.” The old man had visited both his brothers, who were “old and

<!-- chunk -->

### reputable physicians;” both had pronounced the case incurable.

<!-- chunk -->

### “By thus quoting an extreme case of diabetes mellitus, in an old man

<!-- chunk -->

### 74 or 75, I desire to show that the Rhus aromatica is the most reliable

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy that has hitherto been used.” From my own experience I would

<!-- chunk -->

### agree, but twentieth-century practitioners have used blueberry or

<!-- chunk -->

### bilberry leaf as their standard remedy in type II diabetes and it may be

<!-- chunk -->

### that it is also of great effectiveness.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a case where I used Rhus typhina. A forty-three-year-old

<!-- chunk -->

### woman in Harrisonburg, Virginia, had contracted type I diabetes twenty-

<!-- chunk -->

### two years previously and was on the insulin pump. In most such cases,

<!-- chunk -->

### after so many years, the cells become somewhat insulin-resistant and

<!-- chunk -->

### there are increasing symptoms of what is really type II diabetes. Blood

<!-- chunk -->

### sugar levels gyrated between 400 and as low as twenty-six,

<!-- chunk -->

### unpredictably. She had extreme mood-swings, nervousness, poor

<!-- chunk -->

### eyesight, numbness, and soreness in the legs, cold feet with low sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### levels, and telltale thirst with excessive urination. When her blood sugar

<!-- chunk -->

### levels plunged, she would “cuss like a dirty sailor” and not remember

<!-- chunk -->

### afterwards. After starting on Rhus typhina, three drops, three times per

<!-- chunk -->

### day, blood sugar levels became stable for the first time in ten years and

<!-- chunk -->

### all the above symptoms of type II diabetes disappeared. Of course she

<!-- chunk -->

### still had an insulin pump but now she could tell when her blood sugars

<!-- chunk -->

### were down. She literally threw away her glasses and regained normal

<!-- chunk -->

### eyesight.

<!-- chunk -->

### The bark is collected in the spring, when the sap is running and used

<!-- chunk -->

### per decoction or preserved in alcohol, glycerin, or sugar. The berries are

<!-- chunk -->

### collected as soon as they are ripe and cleaned to remove worms. Usual

<!-- chunk -->

### dose of the tincture, five to thirty drops (Fyfe).

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (bark) astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

### (berries) sour, cooling, astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: (bark) relaxation.

## Juglans nigra (Black Walnut Leaf)

<!-- chunk -->

### Black walnut is a fragrant bitter with astringent properties. The hulls are

<!-- chunk -->

### described under the section on torpor. The leaves are more astringent

<!-- chunk -->

### than the hulls. This is not a remedy I am familiar with through personal

<!-- chunk -->

### experience, but the indications from Dr. Edward Shook (1978, 92)

<!-- chunk -->

### interest us here because they bring out the properties of astringency

<!-- chunk -->

### which are inherent in the leaves, a part of the plant which has long been

<!-- chunk -->

### ignored.

<!-- chunk -->

### Shook used a decoction of walnut leaves to stop diarrhea and tone the

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles of the bowel. “In relaxed and atonic conditions of the muscular

<!-- chunk -->

### structure of any organ, the astringing, contracting, and toning properties

<!-- chunk -->

### of walnut leaves or bark are most remarkable. Let us take, for instance,

<!-- chunk -->

### the ballooned condition of the intestines so frequently met with in our

<!-- chunk -->

### practice.” The terminology illustrates the use of the terms “relaxation”

<!-- chunk -->

### and “astringent” by the old doctors as a description of an energetic state.

<!-- chunk -->

### Shook preferred to combine it with Chondrus crispus, which would be a

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue building mucilage.

<!-- chunk -->

### W. Burns Lingard (1958, 18) recommended fluid extract of black

<!-- chunk -->

### walnut hulls in ten to fifteen minimum doses for “bilious diarrhea,” cases

<!-- chunk -->

### where diarrhea is associated with a free flux of bile from the gall

<!-- chunk -->

### bladder. There may be a bacterial element here, which black walnut is

<!-- chunk -->

### suited to as a remedy.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (leaves) bitter, astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue state: relaxation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ-affinities: mucosa, intestines, skin.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Canker sores, tonsillitis, sore throat, relaxed uvula.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Epistaxis, nasal catarrh.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Hoarseness of the voice.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Internal ulcerations, inflammations, mucous and hemorrhagic

<!-- chunk -->

### discharges.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Diarrhea, dysentery; relaxed and ballooned intestines; bleeding

<!-- chunk -->

### hemorrhoids.

### • Leucorrhea.

### cancers, abscesses, boils, acne.

## Quercus alba, Quercus robur (White Oak Bark)

<!-- chunk -->

### Quercus alba is the officinal plant in North America. Quercus robur is used

<!-- chunk -->

### in Europe. Many other oaks have been used on the same indications.

<!-- chunk -->

### They seem fairly interchangeable. I discussed Quercus rather extensively

<!-- chunk -->

### in The Book of Herbal Wisdom and will give only a brief account here.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oak bark is a very powerful astringent. It tightens, strengthens, and

<!-- chunk -->

### rebuilds varicose veins and hemorrhoids. It is indicated by the nastiest

<!-- chunk -->

### looking, dilapidated veins resembling blue-black clumps of grapes with

<!-- chunk -->

### yellow serum discoloring the tissue. It increases the venous return

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation, tones the veins, reduces the swelling and color, reestablishes

<!-- chunk -->

### the action of the valves in veins, and returns the tissue almost to a new

<!-- chunk -->

### appearance. It also acts on relaxed, rotten gums and, strange to say, on

<!-- chunk -->

### the teeth themselves. Dr. Christopher taught that it could cure cavities

<!-- chunk -->

### and I have seen this so many times (sometimes with x-ray

<!-- chunk -->

### documentation) that I consider it one of the most reliable remedies I

<!-- chunk -->

### know. It is specific for lymphedema following the removal of glands

<!-- chunk -->

### during cancer therapy, but here it cures only about half the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oak is the great remedy when long, arduous suffering or usage has

<!-- chunk -->

### broken down the integrity of mind or body. Dr. Bach introduced Quercus

<!-- chunk -->

### robur for those who fight on against adversity, never giving in, but never

<!-- chunk -->

### succeeding. It helps a person choose the appropriate, winnable battles,

<!-- chunk -->

### instead of trying to “out-integrity” every obstacle. J. G. Rademacher,

<!-- chunk -->

### Compton Burnett, and Dorothy Shepherd developed the use of Q. robur

<!-- chunk -->

### for the treatment of alcoholism (which I have seen confirmed).

<!-- chunk -->

### In the winter of 2000–01, there was a particularly harsh influenza

<!-- chunk -->

### with tendencies towards pneumonia. The hospital beds were full. Ginger

<!-- chunk -->

### root tea helped some people who caught the disease early, but those

<!-- chunk -->

### who were down with it for a long time became exhausted. I saw several

<!-- chunk -->

### people who were yellow and swollen beneath the eyes, with recurrent

<!-- chunk -->

### coughing fits. Oak bark steered them back to health.

<!-- chunk -->

### Oak is such a strong astringent that it can only be used in small doses:

<!-- chunk -->

### one to three drops is my favorite dosage. A gargle is good in gum and

<!-- chunk -->

### teeth problems.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: astringent.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: relaxation, depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: mucosa, veins, tooth, and bone.

### • Sinus congestion and postnasal drip.

## Salvia officinalis (Sage)

<!-- chunk -->

### Sage is a plant of remarkable range and depth. It is oily, astringent, and

<!-- chunk -->

### warming, so it builds fluids, stops or restores their loss, and mildly

<!-- chunk -->

### warms and restores functions associated with fluids. Anthony Godfrey,

<!-- chunk -->

### N.D., of Toronto, put it as simply as can be: “Sage balances fluids of all

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds.” On the one hand, it is used to check excessive flux of fluids from

<!-- chunk -->

### the body, as in the drenching sweats of tuberculosis and menopause,

<!-- chunk -->

### excessive urination, diarrhea, and menstruation. On the other hand, it is

<!-- chunk -->

### used to nourish tissue that is dried out, withered, and atrophic. It has a

<!-- chunk -->

### complex hormonal effect, which makes it drying for young women (a

<!-- chunk -->

### famous antigalactagogue), and moistening for older women. It is a

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulant for tissue depression and blood stagnation. It also has a strong

<!-- chunk -->

### action on the nervous system and is traditionally used for nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### delirium and spasm, drowsiness, lethargy, and weak nerve reflexes

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with low fevers.

<!-- chunk -->

### On the simplest level, we may think of sage as it is used in cooking: to

<!-- chunk -->

### help digest the fats. It stimulates the gall bladder—I used it once to cure

<!-- chunk -->

### gall bladder colic—improves digestion, and lubricates the colon. Like

<!-- chunk -->

### burdock, it improves the use of fats and oils in the interior, especially

<!-- chunk -->

### helping them build tissue. It moistens and rebuilds dried skin, and

<!-- chunk -->

### especially, dried tendons. When I go to take the pulse and I cannot find

<!-- chunk -->

### the tendon that should run alongside the artery, I think of sage and I am

<!-- chunk -->

### never disappointed.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Dietrich Gümble, in Principles of Holistic Therapy with Herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### Essences (1993), states that the principle activity of sage oil is to help

<!-- chunk -->

### with the absorption of fluids into the tissues and cells, enhancing

<!-- chunk -->

### “swellability” of the connective tissue, increasing pliability, and

<!-- chunk -->

### retention of fluids. This gives it a powerful influence on the kidneys.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sage helps the re-absorption of blood from the kidneys back into the

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream and cuts down on fluid loss by excessive urination. The skin

<!-- chunk -->

### and the kidneys communicate to hold in water.

<!-- chunk -->

### By preserving internal fluids, sage prevents nervous irritability and

<!-- chunk -->

### debility (from lack of fluids to sedate and calm the nervous system).

<!-- chunk -->

### Because lipids are the medium of transportation for lipophilic hormones

<!-- chunk -->

### (thyroid, adrenals, gonads) it has a profound influence on the endocrine

<!-- chunk -->

### system and menopause.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is especially called for when the ovaries stop producing estrogen

<!-- chunk -->

### during menopause and the fluids and skin start to dry out. It is suited to

<!-- chunk -->

### the hot flushes, profuse perspiration and emotional imbalance of

<!-- chunk -->

### menopause. It has long been used to increase fertility, but also to stop

<!-- chunk -->

### lactation. Gümbel says sage gives the skin “a soft, feminine look and a

<!-- chunk -->

### good circulation.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Maude Grieve (1931, 703) emphasizes the action of sage on stopping

<!-- chunk -->

### flux from relaxed tissues. “The principle and most valued application of

<!-- chunk -->

### [sage] is as a wash for the cure of affections of the mouth and as a gargle

<!-- chunk -->

### in inflamed sore throat, being excellent for relaxed throat and tonsils,

<!-- chunk -->

### and also for ulcerated throat. The gargle is useful for bleeding gums and

<!-- chunk -->

### to prevent an excessive flow of saliva.” Ben Charles Harris (1961, 161)

<!-- chunk -->

### gives the following formula for relaxed and bleeding gums: sage (one

<!-- chunk -->

### part), sumach (one part), and goldthread (optional; one part).

<!-- chunk -->

### Sage has a long history of use as a folk remedy for sore throat. Sage

<!-- chunk -->

### tea, with some honey in it, is a delicious beverage soothing to the throat,

<!-- chunk -->

### strengthening to the peripheral circulation when there is relaxation of

<!-- chunk -->

### the uvula, tonsils, and mucous membranes. It strengthens resistance to

<!-- chunk -->

### external environmental influences, much like Astragalus. Both

<!-- chunk -->

### consolidate a weak periphery with excessive sweating. Sage is therefore

<!-- chunk -->

### used for those who suffer from coughs, colds, and flu. I used it myself for

<!-- chunk -->

### recurrent sore throats dating back to childhood. A problem I have now

<!-- chunk -->

### largely outgrown, thanks to this remedy.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rudolf Steiner suggested its use in asthma; it is suited to cases where

<!-- chunk -->

### there is excessive expectoration and weakness with a history of “low

<!-- chunk -->

### immunity.” Here is a case history, if we can call it that, illustrating the

<!-- chunk -->

### use of sage in asthma. I was invited to dinner at some friends, where I

<!-- chunk -->

### was treated to a story of my own healing prowess, recounted by the host

<!-- chunk -->

### in front of a millionaire. It was one of those times you cannot help but

<!-- chunk -->

### feel a happy glow on your checks. I had completely forgotten the entire

<!-- chunk -->

### event, though both the husband and the wife vouchsafed all the details.

<!-- chunk -->

### Apparently I brought some sage tincture to a dinner years ago to give to

<!-- chunk -->

### the wife and opened it up part way through the dinner. Her husband,

<!-- chunk -->

### sitting several seats away, had been suffering from asthma for many

<!-- chunk -->

### years. He suddenly took several deep breaths and turned red in the face

<!-- chunk -->

### as oxygen poured into his head. I put the lid back on the bottle with a

<!-- chunk -->

### comment like, “See, even small amounts of an herb will have an effect if

<!-- chunk -->

### it’s the right one.” He started taking sage and has been completely free

<!-- chunk -->

### of asthma since.

<!-- chunk -->

### Hildegard von Bingen recommended it when there were solidified,

<!-- chunk -->

### putrefying humors, or phlegm making a person cough blood, i.e., in

<!-- chunk -->

### tuberculosis. She recommended waiting for the bleeding to stop, then

<!-- chunk -->

### giving sage cooked in mild, sweet wine mixed with water. She also

<!-- chunk -->

### recommends supplementing the diet with butter or olive oil (Physica,

<!-- chunk -->

### I:LXIII), which would indicate that she was thinking of people who do

<!-- chunk -->

### not have enough oil.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sage is also indicated when there is profuse, free perspiration, or night

<!-- chunk -->

### sweats with respiratory diseases (cf. Astragalus). It was an important

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy used to check the colliquative sweating of tuberculosis in the

<!-- chunk -->

### nineteenth century. Sage can be used as a diaphoretic to promote

<!-- chunk -->

### sweating, or as an astringent to contain it. A warm sage tea may provoke

<!-- chunk -->

### a cleansing sweat, which clears out the chill and strengthens the

<!-- chunk -->

### periphery. LeSassier notes that sage especially diffuses sweat from the

<!-- chunk -->

### lung area, whereas ginger brings it more out of the stomach. Such

<!-- chunk -->

### observations form the basis of our knowledge of “organ affinities.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Amy Minel, an herbalist in Ulster County, New York, related a nice

<!-- chunk -->

### case history. A man in his early thirties, thin to begin with, started losing

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids by urination and drying out. His skin was dry and his joints,

<!-- chunk -->

### formerly bendable, were becoming painful. “I feel like I’m becoming an

<!-- chunk -->

### old man,” he said ruefully. She gave sage and licorice. The symptoms

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly and efficiently reversed themselves.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is another case from a student in Pennsylvania. A friend suffered

<!-- chunk -->

### from profuse sweating and urination, aggravated or caused by

<!-- chunk -->

### hypertensive remedies. She was suffering from labile hypertension. She

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended a quart a day of fresh sumach berry and sage leaf tea. The

<!-- chunk -->

### profuse fluid losses were quickly checked.

<!-- chunk -->

### Sage acts on veins that are relaxed and depressed. Sage bath oil is

<!-- chunk -->

### used in anthroposophical medicine as a remedy for the veins. Sage also

<!-- chunk -->

### dissolves clotted blood. Salvia miltiorrhiza is a major remedy for

<!-- chunk -->

### “congealed blood” in traditional Chinese medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### I was first made aware of the use of our Western or garden sage as a

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy for blood stagnation in a manuscript relating the teachings of

<!-- chunk -->

### herbalist Eva Graf (1978, 14–6), of Great Barrington, Massachusetts. She

<!-- chunk -->

### used it to cleanse the blood vessels, to remove plaque or hardening, for

<!-- chunk -->

### varicose veins, to restrain immoderate bleeding of dark, coagulated

<!-- chunk -->

### blood, diabetic ulcerations of the veins, especially of the calves. She

<!-- chunk -->

### assures her students that it dissolves clots without releasing them into

<!-- chunk -->

### the circulation to cause emboli and so forth. Hot sage tea, she says, will

<!-- chunk -->

### banish depression quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mrs. Graf tells a typical folk-medical story about “a little girl who had

<!-- chunk -->

### a disease where her blood vessels had gone through and all of her legs

<!-- chunk -->

### and arms were kind of black looking. It was quite terrible to look at. The

<!-- chunk -->

### doctors said, ‘There’s nothing we can do for it and it will eventually kill

<!-- chunk -->

### her.’ It took two sage baths where they completely immersed the child in

<!-- chunk -->

### sage tea, and played with her for a period of twenty minutes, to

<!-- chunk -->

### completely take care of the whole condition.” Let the doctors complain

<!-- chunk -->

### of a lack of detail and the anecdotal nature of such stories; in herbalism

<!-- chunk -->

### we appreciate the graphic picture in the story more than the medical

<!-- chunk -->

### diagnosis. Also, we appreciate the success, rather than the theory and

<!-- chunk -->

### consensus opinion of experts.

<!-- chunk -->

### In holistic medicine we follow the American Indian method, where the

<!-- chunk -->

### story is held to convey “medicine power.” Fortified with this story, I

<!-- chunk -->

### applied sage to the foot of a woman who had been nearly paralyzed in a

<!-- chunk -->

### car accident, and whose cerebellum had been damaged. She was able to

<!-- chunk -->

### walk with great difficulty and needed an antispasmodic drug to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### muscular spasms. An operation on her right foot, or perhaps just the

<!-- chunk -->

### problems incipient to her condition, caused the foot to become swollen

<!-- chunk -->

### and blue/purple. Tests showed no obvious reason for the problem. When

<!-- chunk -->

### we applied sage, internally and externally, the condition promptly

<!-- chunk -->

### lessened and went away in several weeks. (In this instance I had to use

<!-- chunk -->

### California sage as well, since I was running out of garden sage).

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is another case history. A forty-five-year-old man smashed his

<!-- chunk -->

### calf into a wood stove. He suffered internal contusions with swelling,

<!-- chunk -->

### tenderness, and lumpiness along the veins. When he took a flight the

<!-- chunk -->

### high altitude caused troubled breathing, due to blood clots breaking

<!-- chunk -->

### loose and blocking capillaries in the lungs. Thereafter, he had to avoid

<!-- chunk -->

### flying. Yarrow, St. John’s Wort, and other remedies helped, but nothing

<!-- chunk -->

### really moved the condition for the following year and a half. Finally I

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended sage, internally and externally. He used what he had on

<!-- chunk -->

### hand—California white sage (Saliva apiana). The lumps dissipated within

<!-- chunk -->

### two weeks, the veins tingled with new life, and the circulation to the

<!-- chunk -->

### extremities improved. Even some lumps on his arm that he got as a boy

<!-- chunk -->

### disappeared.

<!-- chunk -->

### The great white sage (Salvia apiana), native to California, can be used

<!-- chunk -->

### in place of garden sage (S. officinalis). It is more stimulating and

<!-- chunk -->

### warming, but less astringent. Here it might be well to quote William

<!-- chunk -->

### Turner (1562, 275): “Dioscorides maketh but one kind of Sage,

<!-- chunk -->

### but … now are there found more kinds, the which, though they differ

<!-- chunk -->

### one from another much in roughness and smoothness, in greatness and

<!-- chunk -->

### smallness, and in diversity of colours, yet in my judgment do agree in

<!-- chunk -->

### one virtue and property, and although some be stronger than other some

<!-- chunk -->

### be.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Sage tea is prepared by steeping a closed pot, to prevent the loss of the

<!-- chunk -->

### volatile oils. It is taken hot to induce sweating and cold to prevent

<!-- chunk -->

### sweating and discharges. Some honey can be added for flavor, making it

<!-- chunk -->

### a delicious drink. A tincture can be prepared from the leaves. For a more

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating, less astringent tincture, use California or great white sage

<!-- chunk -->

### (Salvia apiana). I use the tincture in small doses.

## Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut)

<!-- chunk -->

### Horse Chestnut is an interesting remedy because it unites a strong

<!-- chunk -->

### warming stimulation to the astringency. Thus it increases circulation as

<!-- chunk -->

### well as improving the tone of the veins. It acts strongly on passive

<!-- chunk -->

### venous congestion and hence is an astringent with a strong activity on

<!-- chunk -->

### neuromuscular tension, which is often caused by venous backup. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### widely used as a remedy to relax horses after a workout. At one time a

<!-- chunk -->

### horse liniment was sold in farm supply stores. Herbalist Evelyn Snook

<!-- chunk -->

### made a liniment by peeling horse chestnuts and macerating them for two

<!-- chunk -->

### weeks in witch hazel (Jennifer Tucker). It can also be made by chopping

<!-- chunk -->

### the nuts and hulls without peeling them.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Edward Bach used this plant under the name “white chestnut” as

<!-- chunk -->

### one of his flower essences. It is suited to people who feel attacked by

<!-- chunk -->

### their own thoughts, and unable to find peace and rest. This has been

<!-- chunk -->

### borne out in practitioner experience, and indeed, it is a keynote around

<!-- chunk -->

### which the physical symptoms associated with the remedy may be

<!-- chunk -->

### organized for greater clarity. Aesculus hippocastanum (whether the herb,

<!-- chunk -->

### the flower essence, or the homeopathic remedy) is suited to people who

<!-- chunk -->

### are suffering from obsessive/compulsive thought disorders. Thoughts are

<!-- chunk -->

### continual and give no rest. Insomnia is common.

<!-- chunk -->

### The pulse corresponds to the psychological profile. In a fully

<!-- chunk -->

### developed case it feels as if there is not enough space between the beats,

<!-- chunk -->

### which are bounding and tensed up. It is as if there is not enough space

<!-- chunk -->

### for the thoughts, which fill the mind and cause tension; also for the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood, which makes the pulse bounding, as if looking for a place to

<!-- chunk -->

### escape, as with a hemorrhoid, for instance.

<!-- chunk -->

### These pulse indications are based on my experience. The following is

<!-- chunk -->

### one of the more dramatic of many cases in which I have used Aesculus

<!-- chunk -->

### hippocastanum. A woman came to see me for glaucoma. She was legally

<!-- chunk -->

### blind; her eyesight was damaged by forceps delivery forty-five years

<!-- chunk -->

### previous. She had hemorrhoids, mental restlessness, and sleeplessness. “I

<!-- chunk -->

### have not slept for over four months,” she said. I didn’t need anymore

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms. Aesculus hip. 12x brought a flow of tears to her dry eyes and

<!-- chunk -->

### completely cured the insomnia, hemorrhoids, and glaucoma.

<!-- chunk -->

### In another case, an overweight, middle-aged, but rather jolly, woman

<!-- chunk -->

### came to see me for phlebitis, for which she was taking antibiotics. She

<!-- chunk -->

### had moderately high blood pressure and was on a beta-blocker. The

<!-- chunk -->

### veins were distended but not corrugated, like oak bark, nor dark like

<!-- chunk -->

### sumach or echinacea. There was poor circulation to the periphery with

<!-- chunk -->

### cool hands and feet so I thought a stimulating astringent like Aesculus or

<!-- chunk -->

### Collinsonia would be appropriate. Did she have insomnia? All the time.

<!-- chunk -->

### Obsessive thinking? She was on antidepressants and suffered from

<!-- chunk -->

### inability to focus the mind. No glaucoma, fortunately. Aesculus hip.

<!-- chunk -->

### capsules internally and capsules crushed up in witch hazel extract

<!-- chunk -->

### externally. The swelling went down, the phlebitis improved

<!-- chunk -->

### considerably, circulation improved, the skin became smooth and

<!-- chunk -->

### beautiful, and the thinking processes improved.

<!-- chunk -->

### The nineteenth-century doctors classified Aesculus as a remedy for

<!-- chunk -->

### “passive venous congestion” (see, for instance, William Boericke).

<!-- chunk -->

### Hemorrhoids are common as an outlet from the pressure exerted through

<!-- chunk -->

### the veins. This tension backs up through the portal vein to the liver, or

<!-- chunk -->

### perhaps it goes from the liver back upon the portal system. At any rate,

<!-- chunk -->

### it is a remedy for liver congestion, and also a remedy for high blood

<!-- chunk -->

### pressure. Uterine congestion, engorgement, and malposition come under

<!-- chunk -->

### its dominion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. J. Compton Burnett wrote a fine little treatise on hemorrhoids and

<!-- chunk -->

### varicosities entitled Diseases of the Veins. What he says about the internal

<!-- chunk -->

### pathology associated with hemorrhoidal conditions helps us to

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the organ-affinities of Aesculus. “Heart affections; imperfect

<!-- chunk -->

### aeration of the blood; liver affections; congestion in the portal system of

<!-- chunk -->

### veins; enlarged spleen; abdominal tumors; great accumulation of fat in

<!-- chunk -->

### the omentum, or of feces in the intestines; in fact, anything that disturbs

<!-- chunk -->

### the reflex of blood to the right heart, vena cava interior, vena portae,

<!-- chunk -->

### tends to hypo-static hyperemia of the hemorrhoidal veins.” This

<!-- chunk -->

### perfectly describes the structures to which Aesculus has an affinity,

<!-- chunk -->

### though Burnett had no acquaintance with this valuable remedy at the

<!-- chunk -->

### time he wrote.

<!-- chunk -->

### Julia Graves remarks, “The venous tonic in Germany is horse chestnut.

<!-- chunk -->

### Every supermarket has Aesculus capsules for ‘tired legs and veins.’ They

<!-- chunk -->

### even advertise it on television. The tincture or salve on the legs gives a

<!-- chunk -->

### nice feeling of lightness. I believe it makes the venous blood rise, giving

<!-- chunk -->

### it levity to defy gravity. Also, it is a big rheumatic remedy for the left

<!-- chunk -->

### knee specifically, and the creme helps me with pain in the left knee and

<!-- chunk -->

### pain in the hips.” Also, “I feel the tincture sucks the venous blood

<!-- chunk -->

### upwards, thus helping the veins not to get too bogged down. I do not get

<!-- chunk -->

### that sensation from using any of the other varicose remedies, such as

<!-- chunk -->

### sage, witch hazel, or oak. It even seems to lift up the piles. I have asked

<!-- chunk -->

### others and they have confirmed this sensation.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Aesculus is moderately toxic and should not be used internally, except

<!-- chunk -->

### in homeopathic form or small doses (one to three drops). It is similar in

<!-- chunk -->

### action to Collinsonia, with which it is often combined as a hemorrhoid

<!-- chunk -->

### salve.

# A

<!-- chunk -->

### s we have mentioned previously, in Greek medicine there are two

<!-- chunk -->

### kinds of dampness, that which flows and that which remains

<!-- chunk -->

### stuck in the tissues. The latter is the genesis of the of torpid

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state. This condition is not only associated with a buildup of

<!-- chunk -->

### unneeded fluids, but with their precipitation into thickened phlegm—

<!-- chunk -->

### mucopolysaccharides, actually—which were called “humors” in the old

<!-- chunk -->

### literature. In addition to the thickening of fluids, waste products build

<!-- chunk -->

### up because of the stuck state of transportation in the body. Indeed, even

<!-- chunk -->

### unused food becomes a waste product. Meanwhile, the tissues are not

<!-- chunk -->

### getting enough nutrition and they tend to become flabby and weak. The

<!-- chunk -->

### thickening fluids cause pain in the muscles. It would be called

<!-- chunk -->

### fibromyalgia today, or rheumatism (dampness) as per the old books. The

<!-- chunk -->

### single most characteristic symptom is said to be skin lesions. Another

<!-- chunk -->

### typical symptom is hangover. The digestion and liver functions are

<!-- chunk -->

### backed up. Lymphatic stagnation and sluggishness in also typical. The

<!-- chunk -->

### channels of elimination may be taxed. Some cases of hypothyroidism

<!-- chunk -->

### would fit here.

<!-- chunk -->

### All of these are easy enough to describe, but torpor is a hard folk

<!-- chunk -->

### medical diagnosis to make. In my experience, the best indication is a

<!-- chunk -->

### pulse where the beat is obscured, as if by phlegm or water. Dr. John

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder pointed out this pulse as a major indicator for “bad blood,” i.e.,

<!-- chunk -->

### torpor. He also noted the lack of expression in the tissues.

<!-- chunk -->

### The term alterative was introduced to indicate that the body was

<!-- chunk -->

### altered in some unknown fashion. It is connected perhaps with Galen’s

<!-- chunk -->

### use of the term “alteration” to describe what changes food into

<!-- chunk -->

### nutriment for the tissues, i.e., what we would call metabolism. Faults of

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism and elimination of waste products are indeed the stuff from

<!-- chunk -->

### which torpor, toxemia, or damp stagnation is made. And its names are

<!-- chunk -->

### legion—bad blood, impure blood, humors in the blood, humor, and

<!-- chunk -->

### toxemia.

<!-- chunk -->

### I rather like the term “blood purifier” more than alterative, as it is

<!-- chunk -->

### more expressive and meaningful. In addition to blood purifiers or

<!-- chunk -->

### alteratives, the main remedies for this tissue state include laxatives. Most

<!-- chunk -->

### of these agents are bitter: Arctium (burdock root), Taraxacum (dandelion

<!-- chunk -->

### root), Hydrastis (goldenseal), Xanthorrhiza (yellow root), Medicago

<!-- chunk -->

### (alfalfa), Polymnia (bearsfoot), Berberis vulgaris (barberry), and Berberis

<!-- chunk -->

### aquifolium (mahonia). The bitter laxatives are: Aloe, Juglans nigra (black

<!-- chunk -->

### walnut), Rhamnus (buckthorn, cascara sagrada), Cassia (senna), and

<!-- chunk -->

### Phytolacca (poke root). Alterative and laxative Rumex crispus (yellow

<!-- chunk -->

### dock root) is sour, astringent, and bitter. Its cousin Rheum (rhubarb) is

<!-- chunk -->

### bitter, acrid, and sour. In excess, bitters can dry out tissue.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are also some non-bitter alteratives such as Smilax ornata

<!-- chunk -->

### (sarsaparilla), Fumaria officinalis (fumitory), Trifolium pratense (red

<!-- chunk -->

### clover), and Urtica (nettle). Most of these plants increase digestion and

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism because they are nourishing. As mentioned above, there

<!-- chunk -->

### tends to be an interplay between stagnation and atrophy, even though

<!-- chunk -->

### one condition is too damp and the other too dry. Both limit organ

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition, elimination, and function.

<!-- chunk -->

## Arctium lappa (Burdock)

<!-- chunk -->

### I have placed burdock here under the alteratives since it is usually

<!-- chunk -->

### classified as one of the front rank blood purifiers. However, I tend to

<!-- chunk -->

### think of it as a nutritive tonic as well because it is so oily. It nourishes

<!-- chunk -->

### and cleanses the lipid pathways of the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Burdock is bitter, sweet, and oily. It is therefore well suited to

<!-- chunk -->

### dry/atrophic conditions when an alterative would be useful. The oil

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulates increased secretion of bile, promoting better absorption of fats

<!-- chunk -->

### and oils through the small intestine and better activity in the gall

<!-- chunk -->

### bladder. It is called for when there is poor secretion of bile, indicated by

<!-- chunk -->

### dry stool, constipation, and poor emulsification of fats and oils. With low

<!-- chunk -->

### absorption of lipids there is a shortage of these substances in the body.

<!-- chunk -->

### Burdock is thus associated with dry, scaly skin conditions and dry skin in

<!-- chunk -->

### general. Sometimes the sebaceous glands get blocked, due to a lack of oil

<!-- chunk -->

### moving through, resulting in inflammation (hence the association of

<!-- chunk -->

### burdock with acne and boils). The sinuses and lungs are also dry and the

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion through the kidneys is limited. This results in dry tissues, or

<!-- chunk -->

### water retention conjoined with the dryness. The liver is also affected.

<!-- chunk -->

### With a lack of fats and oils, there is reduced anabolism of foodstuffs for

<!-- chunk -->

### the body, with wasting and dryness (dry/atrophy). In order to get

<!-- chunk -->

### nutrition, there may be a dependence on “quick fixes” of sugar. Thus, it

<!-- chunk -->

### is a remedy for sugar imbalances. Since steroid and sex hormones are

<!-- chunk -->

### made from oil and require oil for transmission through the body, and all

<!-- chunk -->

### hormones of any kind require adequate fluids for movement, burdock

<!-- chunk -->

### comes up as something of an endocrine and reproductive remedy. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### sometimes beneficial in swollen prostate. It may be necessary when

<!-- chunk -->

### there is not enough oil to maintain healthy adrenals and steroid-

<!-- chunk -->

### building. By moistening the system, burdock also has an influence on the

<!-- chunk -->

### kidneys. It is an old remedy for kidney stones.

<!-- chunk -->

### Generally, in my experience, people who need burdock are on the thin

<!-- chunk -->

### side, nervous, with dry skin and scalp. It may be necessary to give small

<!-- chunk -->

### to large doses over a long time as a building rejuvenative.

<!-- chunk -->

### The root is used for chronic conditions, the seed in acute. A biennial,

<!-- chunk -->

### the roots are dug at the end of the first year or the beginning of the

<!-- chunk -->

### second; the seed are harvested just after the end of the second year,

<!-- chunk -->

### before the plant is completely dead; the leaves are sometimes used

<!-- chunk -->

### externally as a poultice. The root, high in oils, easily goes rancid and

<!-- chunk -->

### needs to be dried with artificial heat and left in the open air. It extracts

<!-- chunk -->

### well in alcohol (brandy is a very good medium). The dried root and

<!-- chunk -->

### seeds may be used by decoction as a tea.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (root) sweet, bitter, pungent, warm, oily.

<!-- chunk -->

### (seed) bitter, pungent, sweet, warm, diffusive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: atrophy, torpor.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: liver, gall bladder, kidneys, skin, endocrine system.

## Berberis aquifolium, Mahonia spp.

<!-- chunk -->

## (Oregon Grape Root)

<!-- chunk -->

### The older literature usually calls Oregon grape root Berberis aquifolium.

<!-- chunk -->

### For the sake of distinction it is convenient to use the name Mahonia.

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many different species that are used interchangeably.

<!-- chunk -->

### However, it cannot be used in place of its cousin Berberis vulgaris. The

<!-- chunk -->

### two have different properties. Both are bitter, but the Mahonias are

<!-- chunk -->

### suited to dry, thin persons, while Berberis, like dandelion, is better for

<!-- chunk -->

### heat and stagnation of fluids.

<!-- chunk -->

### Mahonia is suited to dry, atrophic conditions where the anabolic

<!-- chunk -->

### function of the liver and the secretory aspect of digestion are

<!-- chunk -->

### compromised. It is also suited to heat, chills, intermittent fever, and

<!-- chunk -->

### muscular trembling which arise because the fluids are too low to sedate

<!-- chunk -->

### the heat. The muscles cannot resist tensions and chills (see Ellingwood,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1919, 369–70). Like other intense bitter tonics, it is suited to conditions

<!-- chunk -->

### of stagnation. The tissues dry out and the fluids are caught and build up.

<!-- chunk -->

### Scudder, (quoted by Fyfe, 1909, 417) gives a good overview of

<!-- chunk -->

### Mahonia, which he calls “berberis.” It “is a blood maker. It does this by

<!-- chunk -->

### promoting secretion and excretion. It stimulates the glands of the body,

<!-- chunk -->

### and especially the lymphatics and the liver. It is said to have a diuretic

<!-- chunk -->

### action, also. It certainly aids digestion and assimilation.” From Scudder’s

<!-- chunk -->

### other writings, we know that lack of secretion and excretion is his

<!-- chunk -->

### definition of “bad blood.”

<!-- chunk -->

### From its affinity for glandular structures it acts quickly and

<!-- chunk -->

### pleasingly in hepatic torpor, and is said to prove its efficiency as a

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy when given for cirrhosis of the liver. In stomatitis

<!-- chunk -->

### [canker-sores] and in dyspepsia, especially when in its incipiency

<!-- chunk -->

### and when coupled with hepatic affections, berberis is given with

<!-- chunk -->

### confidence.

<!-- chunk -->

### In chronic disease of the mucous membranes, as catarrh,

<!-- chunk -->

### leucorrhea, bronchorrhea, etc., it is just as efficient. In chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### pulmonary affections in persons of syphilitic or broken down,

<!-- chunk -->

### depraved constitutions, berberis is a miracle worker. It rights the

<!-- chunk -->

### wrongs and cleans the Augean stables, sharpens the appetite,

<!-- chunk -->

### gives new tone and new blood to the body, and comes as near to

<!-- chunk -->

### curing consumption as any remedy known to us at the time. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### both a blood maker and a blood cleanser, and as there is no

<!-- chunk -->

### known remedy so virulent to microorganisms of nearly all

<!-- chunk -->

### varieties, as healthy blood serum, berberis becomes, indirectly if

<!-- chunk -->

### not directly a microbicide.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is an excellent tonic to the weak and debilitated—to the

<!-- chunk -->

### convalescent. It may be safely added to cascara sagrada for the

<!-- chunk -->

### cure of constipation. As we have faith in medicine, we have faith

<!-- chunk -->

### in the so-called alterative and tonic effects of berberis aquifolium

<!-- chunk -->

### when given in appreciable doses. When effective, we like the

<!-- chunk -->

### small dose; when necessary we give the large one with equal

<!-- chunk -->

### delight.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalist Terry Willard (1988, 112) uses Mahonia as a tonic for

<!-- chunk -->

### delicate and weak children. “It alleviates anemia and general

<!-- chunk -->

### malnutrition in just a few weeks.” The typical Mahonia patient is thin,

<!-- chunk -->

### dry, and constipated, with rough, scaly, dry skin.

<!-- chunk -->

### I am sure I am not the only herbalist who has discovered that Oregon

<!-- chunk -->

### grape root combines nicely with burdock root, but just in case this fact

<!-- chunk -->

### goes unnoticed, I will say that the two are particularly compatible. Both

<!-- chunk -->

### are bitter alteratives suited to thin, dry, atrophic patients.

<!-- chunk -->

### “When effective, we like the small dose; when necessary we give the

<!-- chunk -->

### large one with equal delight” (Scudder). Usual dose of the tincture or

<!-- chunk -->

### fluid extract, five to thirty drops (Fyfe).

## Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion)

<!-- chunk -->

### Dandelion has a general reputation as a “spring tonic” and “blood

<!-- chunk -->

### purifier.” However, it has more specific indications that are little known.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is particularly suited to eliminating “thickened humors.” It is indicated

<!-- chunk -->

### when the bile is thick and the liver and gall bladder are congested, or

<!-- chunk -->

### when the kidneys are sluggish. With these thickened fluids there is

<!-- chunk -->

### usually a low-grade heat. Dandelion is especially indicated where there

<!-- chunk -->

### is a “mapped or geographical tongue.” This specific indication comes to

<!-- chunk -->

### us from the homeopathic provings of Samuel Hahnemann. I have

<!-- chunk -->

### verified it scores of times. “Tongue covered with a white film; feels raw;

<!-- chunk -->

### comes off in patches, leaving red, sensitive spots” (Boericke, 1927, 633).

<!-- chunk -->

### If we understand the significance of the mapped tongue, we

<!-- chunk -->

### understand the process to which dandelion is remedial. This indication

<!-- chunk -->

### would be associated with “phlegm fire” in traditional Chinese medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### The basic idea is that heat is baking down fluids while thickened fluids

<!-- chunk -->

### are blocking the outward escape of the heat. In practice, I find that

<!-- chunk -->

### dandelion is indicated when heat has settled in the deeper tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### (muscles, bones), and is simmering away. It is well indicated when there

<!-- chunk -->

### is decalcification from infection in the bone.

<!-- chunk -->

### I was not expecting dandelion to be a remedy for manic/depression,

<!-- chunk -->

### but following the mapped tongue indication I have actually cured two

<!-- chunk -->

### cases. In both, the tongue cleared and the terrible mentality was

<!-- chunk -->

### apparently removed permanently. Usually, when one clears off the

<!-- chunk -->

### mapped tongue it does not come back.

<!-- chunk -->

### Here is a beautiful case history, using both the flower essence and

<!-- chunk -->

### herbal tongue indications, passed on by herbalist Julia Graves in

<!-- chunk -->

### conversation. The allergies and rings around the eyes suggest the

<!-- chunk -->

### kidneys and liver. “An eight-year-old girl, lanky, tall, skinny, pale, with

<!-- chunk -->

### black rings around the eyes, severe pollen allergies. Her mom brings her

<!-- chunk -->

### in because of her episodes of breathtaking meanness. Her tongue is

<!-- chunk -->

### coated white, with angry red patches. The mother says she has had this

<!-- chunk -->

### since at least age three. One dose of dandelion flower essence brought

<!-- chunk -->

### about a complete change. Her walk became graceful, her complexion

<!-- chunk -->

### golden and radiant and she features a big smile. The tongue is less red.

<!-- chunk -->

### Taking the essence and herb for a week stops her meanness. She shares

<!-- chunk -->

### more willingly with her younger brother and plays with him sweetly.

<!-- chunk -->

### She even allows role inversion in the play, where he is allowed to be the

<!-- chunk -->

### dad and her the child.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The root is used more for the alterative effect, to thin the fluids and

<!-- chunk -->

### reduce heat. It is indicated in stagnant bile, where heat is baking down

<!-- chunk -->

### the bile and we get gallstones. It has long been used to slowly cleanse

<!-- chunk -->

### the liver and gall bladder. The digestion is sometimes disordered.

<!-- chunk -->

### Salivation, bitter taste, eructations, loss of appetite, fermentation and

<!-- chunk -->

### swelling in the bowels, chilliness after eating.

<!-- chunk -->

### The leaf is salty/minerally, so it increases water removal and is

<!-- chunk -->

### diuretic. It is indicated when the patient feels better from urination;

<!-- chunk -->

### tired, achy, feverish, chronic infections, with relief from urination.

<!-- chunk -->

### Because the leaves contain both sodium and potassium, they remove

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids while increasing potassium levels. Dandelion is effective in small

<!-- chunk -->

### to large doses, fresh or dry.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (root) bitter, sweet, salty/minerally, moist, oily. (leaf) bitter,

<!-- chunk -->

### salty/minerally, moist, cool.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: torpor.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: liver, kidneys, muscles, and bones.

### has been exfoliated by heat, or when the coating is yellow, or there

### are only traces of the coat, or for a dark, red tongue.

## Juglans nigra (Black Walnut)

<!-- chunk -->

### Traditionally, the blackened, ripened hulls of the black walnut were

<!-- chunk -->

### used, but recently Huldah Clark has insisted upon the use of the green

<!-- chunk -->

### hulls. The old herbalists had no problem with the blackened hulls and

<!-- chunk -->

### those who were taught by their elders, rather than out of books, should

<!-- chunk -->

### not feel bad in adhering to this practice. The leaves are even more

<!-- chunk -->

### astringent, and these are the component lauded by Dr. Edward Shook

<!-- chunk -->

### (Astringents, Damp Flowing, or the Relaxed Tissue State, this page).

<!-- chunk -->

### Black walnut is both an alterative and a laxative. Its oils stimulate the

<!-- chunk -->

### gall bladder and liver and lubricate the intestines to remove

<!-- chunk -->

### constipation. Butternut bark is somewhat oilier and may be substituted

<!-- chunk -->

### when this effect is needed. It will stimulate the removal of gallstones

<!-- chunk -->

### from the gall bladder quite effectively. Black walnut hulls are also

<!-- chunk -->

### antibacterial and antiparasitical so they can remove diarrhea due to

<!-- chunk -->

### infection and the green hulls, to follow Huldah Clark, are particularly

<!-- chunk -->

### effective against parasites. Black walnut undoubtedly goes deeper, like

<!-- chunk -->

### burdock, into the lipid economy, improving skin conditions such as

<!-- chunk -->

### impetigo that involve microorganisms.

<!-- chunk -->

### The alterative effect of black walnut is increased by the fact that it

<!-- chunk -->

### acts on the thyroid, the keeper of the metabolism. Black walnut is high

<!-- chunk -->

### in iodine. Phyllis Light notes that the black hulls (not green) are a

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional remedy in the South for goiter. The high iodine content

<!-- chunk -->

### causes the characteristic black dye of walnut hulls. The hulls are bitter,

<!-- chunk -->

### oily, astringent, and slightly sweet (the reverse of the nuts, which are

<!-- chunk -->

### sweet, oily, slightly astringent, and bitter). Because it is a remedy for

<!-- chunk -->

### hypothyroidism, black walnut also works on fibromyalgia, which is often

<!-- chunk -->

### associated with this problem, this again from Phyllis Light.

<!-- chunk -->

### Another characteristic of black walnut (and several of its cousins) is

<!-- chunk -->

### that it produces herbicides in its roots that kill off plants trying to grow

<!-- chunk -->

### underneath it, including its own young. This points to its use in killing

<!-- chunk -->

### parasites, bacteria, fungus, and yeast in the intestines. The reason it is

<!-- chunk -->

### able to survive from generation to generation is because of the hull of

<!-- chunk -->

### the nut, which causes it to bounce away from the tree. This signature

<!-- chunk -->

### points to the teaching of Dr. Bach: walnut is for those who are too much

<!-- chunk -->

### under the influence of another. It corrects a poor parental/child

<!-- chunk -->

### relationship, where there is too much domination and closeness. From

<!-- chunk -->

### experience I can say it also acts the opposite way: to heal children who

<!-- chunk -->

### have lost a parent or are experiencing problems with parental

<!-- chunk -->

### separation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Black walnut not only cleanses the colon, but according to Phyllis it

<!-- chunk -->

### treats leaky gut syndrome, where toxins are getting into the bloodstream

<!-- chunk -->

### through the small intestine. It also treats the opposite, or malabsorption

<!-- chunk -->

### from a closed gut. She says it helps the assimilation of nutrients,

<!-- chunk -->

### especially fats and proteins, and reduces unhealthy fatty acids in the

<!-- chunk -->

### bloodstream.

<!-- chunk -->

### In February 2003, a woman in her early sixties consulted me for

<!-- chunk -->

### various problems. She had low thyroid for many years, her mother had

<!-- chunk -->

### low thyroid, and she had something of the hysterical voice one often

<!-- chunk -->

### finds in high and low thyroid cases. She refused to take thyroid

<!-- chunk -->

### supplementation from the doctors. I put her on black walnut hull

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture, three drops, three times per day. In August, tests showed

<!-- chunk -->

### normal thyroid levels for the first time in her life. She maintained a

<!-- chunk -->

### normal volume and pitch of voice for the first time since I had known

<!-- chunk -->

### her, some twenty years. I only wished I had been able to give her black

<!-- chunk -->

### walnut hulls back when I first met her.

## Taste: (hulls) pungent, bitter, astringent, aromatic.

## Tissue State: torpor, depression.

<!-- chunk -->

### he depressed tissue state is an interesting one. It is well described

<!-- chunk -->

### by the term “cold,” but the cold here is one of the tissues and

<!-- chunk -->

### functions, a deep cold within the organism from the dying down

<!-- chunk -->

### of the innate heat of life, and not from mere exposure to cold. Yet that

<!-- chunk -->

### latter and more superficial type of cold would also respond to the

<!-- chunk -->

### characteristic remedies used here—stimulants.

<!-- chunk -->

### Depression is characterized by cold skin and extremities, pus-

<!-- chunk -->

### generating diseases, sepsis, putrefaction, dark colors in the complexion

<!-- chunk -->

### and tongue, low oxidation of the tissues, the appearance of bacteria or

<!-- chunk -->

### parasites which are living off tissue waste and secreting toxins that

<!-- chunk -->

### depress the tissue functions of the host. This is not a condition of

<!-- chunk -->

### toxicity, as in the previous tissue state, so much as poisoning, or tissue

<!-- chunk -->

### death. Yet the progression starts slowly, is not too evident at first, and

<!-- chunk -->

### thus, the depressed tissue state presents a subtle expression in the earlier

<!-- chunk -->

### stages.

<!-- chunk -->

### Treatment of depression is usually by aromatics containing volatile

<!-- chunk -->

### oils. These are oils that quickly vaporize into the atmosphere. The oils

<!-- chunk -->

### used to treat atrophy are either fixed, nonvolatile food oils or such large

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts of volatile oil that they function like fixed oils. Throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### world, fragrant plants are used to banish depressive, putrefactive, dead

<!-- chunk -->

### energy, or bring in life-giving, spiritualizing influences. They quickly

<!-- chunk -->

### energize the lungs and open them up to life-giving oxygen, which this

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue state needs. The aromatic property is akin to the pungent taste,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is not really a taste but a smell.

<!-- chunk -->

### More broadly, remedies for the depressed tissue state may be called

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulants. There are several kinds, including aromatics, pungent and

<!-- chunk -->

### spicy herbs, fragrant bitters, and pine oils. Most stimulants are warming,

<!-- chunk -->

### but some so influence the organism that they end up being cooling, like

<!-- chunk -->

### Echinacea, Lavendula, and Achillea. Stimulants that act on the stomach to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase function and decrease indigestion and gas are known as

<!-- chunk -->

### carminatives.

<!-- chunk -->

### The most common stimulants are the pungent and spicy herbs. The

<!-- chunk -->

### former contain sulfur compounds, the latter volatile oils. Typical

<!-- chunk -->

### warming stimulants include Capsicum (cayenne pepper), Curcuma longa

<!-- chunk -->

### (turmeric), Zingiberis (ginger), Armoracia or Cochlearia (horseradish),

<!-- chunk -->

### Allium spp. (garlic, onion), Brassica spp. (cabbage, mustard), Ocimum

<!-- chunk -->

### (basil), Salvia (sage), Oreganum (oregano), Thymus (thyme), Xanthoxylum

<!-- chunk -->

### (prickly ash), Commiphora (myrrh), and Sambucus (fresh elder flowers).

<!-- chunk -->

### Urtica (nettle) is an anomalous stimulant that is neither pungent nor

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatic.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalist David Winston has established an important category called

<!-- chunk -->

### the “fragrant bitters.” These plants, in addition to their uses as bitters,

<!-- chunk -->

### have vermifuge properties. They generally act on depression. This group

<!-- chunk -->

### includes Artemisia absinthium (wormwood), Artemisia annua (sweet

<!-- chunk -->

### annie), Juglans cinerea (butternut), and Juglans nigra (black walnut).

<!-- chunk -->

### Another group acting on depression is the plants containing aromatic

<!-- chunk -->

### pine oils: Pinus strobus (white pine), Thuja occidentalis (cedar), Juniperus

<!-- chunk -->

### communis (juniper), and Tsuga canadensis (hemlock spruce). Members of

<!-- chunk -->

### the heath family (Ericaceae) could also be included here. These are

<!-- chunk -->

### usually designated as “antiseptics.” They remove bacteria by cleansing

<!-- chunk -->

### the environment of bacterial toxins. Another important antiseptic is

<!-- chunk -->

### Baptisia tinctoria (wild indigo).

<!-- chunk -->

## Zingiberis officinalis (Ginger)

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginger rhizome is probably the most simple, widely used stimulating and

<!-- chunk -->

### warming agent. It is used in folk medicine throughout the world. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### suited to cases where the system is cold, the mucosa are inactive, with

<!-- chunk -->

### free secretion and irritation, or the mucus is settled and stagnant so that

<!-- chunk -->

### it needs to be raised by sneezing, coughing, or vomiting. Ginger has an

<!-- chunk -->

### affinity to superficial, acute disease processes, rather than deep, chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### ones. It is used as a local stimulant when the stomach is inactive and

<!-- chunk -->

### congested and the patient feels chilly or when there are chills associated

<!-- chunk -->

### with tension. Ginger pack is used externally on the lungs, to help break

<!-- chunk -->

### up mucus congestion, and on the uterus, to dispel blood congestion.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is especially useful for its effect on the stomach. Julia Graves gives

<!-- chunk -->

### her own testimonial. “I had a cramping stomach for years in medical

<!-- chunk -->

### school from the stress. Sometimes I would have to eat oats in water with

<!-- chunk -->

### a bit of salt as the only diet for weeks, because I could tolerate nothing

<!-- chunk -->

### else. One day I just had the thought to buy some candied ginger. It’s very

<!-- chunk -->

### expensive in Germany, so I had not had any for a long time. My stomach

<!-- chunk -->

### had been in severe cutting pain for days. The minute I ate the first piece

<!-- chunk -->

### I was cured.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Julia notes that the candied ginger is better for the stomach. Dried

<!-- chunk -->

### ginger is more irritating. It is sold in Germany for seasickness. “Great for

<!-- chunk -->

### nausea and car sickness, especially in the cold winter.” It is

<!-- chunk -->

### contraindicated in heat. “Ginger foot baths are so good, for any kind of

<!-- chunk -->

### warming up or belly cramps. Makes you sweat, like a sauna.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Ginger oil is an excellent warming stimulant for spasmodic muscles, as

<!-- chunk -->

### I can attest from personal experience. Here it is rivaled by the American

<!-- chunk -->

### wild ginger (Asarum canadensis), a superlative remedy for muscle spasm

<!-- chunk -->

### better from warmth (Lise Wolff).

### organism than ginger, which has more effect on the exterior—skin,

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles, stomach. It was classified as “warm in the first degree” in

<!-- chunk -->

### traditional Greek medicine, which means that it drives fluids out

<!-- chunk -->

### through the skin. However, the warmth is quite penetrating and I myself,

<!-- chunk -->

### with a hot digestive tract, find it very irritating on the stomach. I think

<!-- chunk -->

### of it as penetrating as far as the third degree of heat, which was the

<!-- chunk -->

### category of medicines that have an antiseptic, antipurulent virtue, but

<!-- chunk -->

### who am I to argue with the old Greek physicians who invented the

<!-- chunk -->

### degrees?

<!-- chunk -->

### Calendula is perhaps the best general remedy when swollen glands

<!-- chunk -->

### take on an existence of their own, lingering after an acute illness or

<!-- chunk -->

### coming and going with “low immunity.” It increases the dispersal of

<!-- chunk -->

### fluids through the lymphatic system and quiets inflammation in the

<!-- chunk -->

### glands and ducts. A capital indication is a deep ache in the left chest,

<!-- chunk -->

### above the thoracic outlet of the lymphatic system. This indicates general

<!-- chunk -->

### lymphatic congestion and inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Calendula was an old German folk remedy adopted by Samuel

<!-- chunk -->

### Hahnemann into the homeopathic materia medica as a specific topical

<!-- chunk -->

### dressing for wounds, sores, burns, and infections. The internal

<!-- chunk -->

### indications have not been developed in homeopathy. Regarding these we

<!-- chunk -->

### may say calendula possesses five main uses.

<!-- chunk -->

### 1. It is applied externally to improve lymphatic drainage from wounds

<!-- chunk -->

### and is bacteriostatic, i.e., it does not kill bacteria but prevents the

<!-- chunk -->

### extension of the infection.

<!-- chunk -->

### 2. Used internally it is therapeutic for swollen glands and lingering,

<!-- chunk -->

### unresolved infections.

<!-- chunk -->

### 3. Used for high enzyme counts from damaged liver.

<!-- chunk -->

### 4. Soothing to the digestive mucosa, and other mucous membranes

<!-- chunk -->

### 5. A traditional European peasant “immune tonic.”

<!-- chunk -->

### The flowers are gathered through the year and thrown in soups in the

<!-- chunk -->

### fall and winter to warm and protect against wind and chill. It cleans

<!-- chunk -->

### lymphatic stagnation predisposing to infection. Case histories,

<!-- chunk -->

### illustrating some of these virtues, are given in The Book of Herbal

<!-- chunk -->

### Wisdom.

<!-- chunk -->

### Herbalist Matthew Becker says that calendula is “one of the best

<!-- chunk -->

### diaphoretics for deep fever,” when the bones hurt. He compares it to

<!-- chunk -->

### boneset. I have noticed that it works with people who are “bone weary.”

<!-- chunk -->

### These associations led me to wonder if it does not have some kind of

<!-- chunk -->

### immune stimulating effect on the bone marrow where the immune cells

<!-- chunk -->

### are largely produced.

<!-- chunk -->

### The flowers are collected through the calends of the year and dried.

<!-- chunk -->

### Fresh flowers produce too watery an extract so they are better dried. Can

<!-- chunk -->

### be used as an infusion, tincture, salve, or ointment, in small to large

<!-- chunk -->

### doses.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: bitter, astrigent, sweet, warm, resinous.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue state: cold/depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: skin (vulnerary), lymph/immune, liver.

## Angelica archangelica (Angelica)

<!-- chunk -->

### Angelica is native to cutaneous and northern Europe, as far west as

<!-- chunk -->

### Iceland and Greenland. The American angelica (A. atropupurea) is native

<!-- chunk -->

### through the eastern Woodland region, up into the Canadian shield and

<!-- chunk -->

### west into the Rockies. I use them interchangeably, but only the European

<!-- chunk -->

### archangelica is acceptable in commerce.

<!-- chunk -->

### Throughout the world, various members of this clan are worn on the

<!-- chunk -->

### person as protection against bad vibrations and contagious diseases.

<!-- chunk -->

### They are also considered to have a mild effect on the mind; they relax

<!-- chunk -->

### the thinking apparatus and open the imagination. If one is sensitive, one

<!-- chunk -->

### can fairly easily feel this effectby burning some of the root and inhaling

<!-- chunk -->

### the smoke. The “sphincter of the mind” is relaxed and opened. Thus,

<!-- chunk -->

### angelica was considered a “journeying medicine” in ancient times.

<!-- chunk -->

### Angelica is a sacred herb in Saami or Lapp culture.

<!-- chunk -->

### The root, stalks, leaves, and seeds of angelica are oily, aromatic,

<!-- chunk -->

### warming, and stimulating. This makes them suited to the dry/atrophic

<!-- chunk -->

### and cold/depressive tissue states. They warm up the system, increase the

<!-- chunk -->

### circulation of blood, remove bruises, and increase digestive secretion.

<!-- chunk -->

### Although moistening by virtue of its oily content, angelica often has a

<!-- chunk -->

### warming and drying effect, removing water and mucus in the lungs and

<!-- chunk -->

### gastrointestinal tract. It is suited to dry, undernourished, thin,

<!-- chunk -->

### neurasthenic, often older people with rigid thinking who are subject to

<!-- chunk -->

### respiratory infections, flatulence, bloating, poor digestion, and stiff

<!-- chunk -->

### articulations (Ellen Hopman, David Winston). It is also suited to thick,

<!-- chunk -->

### chunky people with yellow/gray/blue complexion around the veins,

<!-- chunk -->

### showing stagnation of blood and fluids (Matthew Wood).

<!-- chunk -->

### A tall, thin, sixty-two-year-old man came to see me about a number of

<!-- chunk -->

### problems. He walked stiffly and joked about telling his kids (they were

<!-- chunk -->

### quite young) that he needed “oil” to lubricate his hips. His complexion

<!-- chunk -->

### was gray/yellow, the skin was dry, and the hands were somewhat

<!-- chunk -->

### red/purple, showing poor circulation. When we gave him Angelica

<!-- chunk -->

### atropurpurea (I use the local, wild species) his faced reddened, the skin

<!-- chunk -->

### became moister, the hands less purple, and he got up and started

<!-- chunk -->

### dancing around the room like a hula or belly dancer! Old hippies never

<!-- chunk -->

### die. They know enough to trust herbs. We “put the hip back in the

<!-- chunk -->

### hippie.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Angelica is perhaps most important as a carminative or

<!-- chunk -->

### aromatic/bitter stimulant to the stomach and intestines. It improves

<!-- chunk -->

### secretion and removes severe spasm and bloating associated with great

<!-- chunk -->

### pain. It is one of the most important carminatives used in European

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine.

<!-- chunk -->

### Angelica was not originally used as a female medicine in our tradition,

<!-- chunk -->

### like its Chinese cousin Angelica sinensis. It does not possess the estrogenic

<!-- chunk -->

### compounds of the latter. However, by increasing digestion, assimilation,

<!-- chunk -->

### and fat metabolism, while decreasing blood stagnation, it would have

<!-- chunk -->

### pretty much the same effects. Herbalist Stephen Buhner has introduced it

<!-- chunk -->

### for women who are having troubles establishing their own identity or

<!-- chunk -->

### separating from socially accepted role models. They feel hollow and

<!-- chunk -->

### without internal purpose. He especially finds it useful for women in their

<!-- chunk -->

### late twenties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Chinese angelica has been shown to have estrogenic effects,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating uterine contractions. It will do this when given

<!-- chunk -->

### inappropriately to a high estrogen woman. It is better suited to thin, dry

<!-- chunk -->

### women with lack of fat and estrogen, who are having muscular cramps

<!-- chunk -->

### with the period.

<!-- chunk -->

### The seeds and roots are used, extracted in high proof alcohol. Small

<!-- chunk -->

### doses are sufficient, in my experience.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (seed, root): pungent, sweet, bitter, warm, moist, oily,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating, diffusive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: atrophy, depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: lipid digestion and metabolism, respiratory tract,

<!-- chunk -->

### gastrointestinal tract, blood, menses.

<!-- chunk -->

## Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary)

<!-- chunk -->

### This warm, dry, stimulating mint is one of the most important herbs in

<!-- chunk -->

### Mediterranean medicine. It is one of the great stimulants and has some

<!-- chunk -->

### antiseptic power. Dioscorides, Galen, and Plinius described its

<!-- chunk -->

### properties. The Arabic physicians considered it one of the most valuable

<!-- chunk -->

### items in the materia medica. Rosemary is mentioned in the herbals of

<!-- chunk -->

### northern Europe from the Renaissance down to the present. It was

<!-- chunk -->

### popularized by Father Sebastian Kneipp and is still used in conventional

<!-- chunk -->

### medicine in Germany.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Dietrich Gümbel (1993) describes the general physical affinities of

<!-- chunk -->

### rosemary. It acts on the metabolism, enhancing the burning and

<!-- chunk -->

### consumption of blood sugars and fats. It thus cleans and oxidizes

<!-- chunk -->

### throughout the body. Through nerve stimulation, it activates the smooth

<!-- chunk -->

### muscles, thus influencing the arteries, stomach, intestines, gall passages,

<!-- chunk -->

### and heart, while relaxing the voluntary muscles. It acts strongly on the

<!-- chunk -->

### blood organs, especially on the liver, also on the heart, lungs, spleen,

<!-- chunk -->

### and kidneys. The catabolic processes of the liver are increased and more

<!-- chunk -->

### gall is manufactured.

<!-- chunk -->

### By increasing the oxygenation and burning processes throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, excessive blood sugar is used up. This strengthens all the functions

<!-- chunk -->

### of the body, but especially those of the heart and brain, which subsist on

<!-- chunk -->

### huge quantities of blood sugar (Gümbel). Rudolf Steiner taught that

<!-- chunk -->

### rosemary was a diabetes remedy. He associated it with the fire element

<!-- chunk -->

### or warmth organism or “I-consciousness.” It strengthens the sense of self,

<!-- chunk -->

### which is so often lacking in diabetes, and provokes a deeper incarnation.

<!-- chunk -->

### It is good for those who can’t wake up in the morning and need to drink

<!-- chunk -->

### coffee, but, as Julia Graves remarks, do not use too much because it can

<!-- chunk -->

### cause the heart to race.

<!-- chunk -->

### At the same time, rosemary is indicated in people who have too strong

<!-- chunk -->

### an incarnation, so to speak, or who grasp the material world with such

<!-- chunk -->

### vigor that they get headaches and nervous tension. I do not mean that

<!-- chunk -->

### they are materialistic; it is for people who grasp life with great intensity,

<!-- chunk -->

### or not with enough intensity.

<!-- chunk -->

### One of my friends in Vermont had a severe migraine headache that

<!-- chunk -->

### was keeping her in bed. An inspiration came to her to put rosemary

<!-- chunk -->

### under her upper lip and poultice the back of her head. For good measure

<!-- chunk -->

### she wrapped a piece around her temples like a victory wreath. The

<!-- chunk -->

### headache slowly but completely disappeared. Several months latter some

<!-- chunk -->

### friends called her in virtual anguish. The wife had a terrible migraine

<!-- chunk -->

### that had defied all medical help. The husband was supposed to be

<!-- chunk -->

### bringing the daughter back to boarding school the next morning, but

<!-- chunk -->

### now they didn’t dare leave the house. “Do you have any rosemary in the

<!-- chunk -->

### house?” my friend asked. The husband later admitted that his thought

<!-- chunk -->

### was, “How can you talk about cooking at a time like this!” but he

<!-- chunk -->

### answered with a short affirmative. The directions were given and the

<!-- chunk -->

### next day my friend got a call from the husband and daughter on their

<!-- chunk -->

### way to school. The cure was rapid and fairly complete. “I came out

<!-- chunk -->

### looking like some kind of shaman or something,” commented my friend.

<!-- chunk -->

### Those are the best cures.

<!-- chunk -->

### In a somewhat similar vein, Eva Graf (1978, 25) recommends

<!-- chunk -->

### rosemary for tension in the occipital region. She applies a cotton pad

<!-- chunk -->

### saturated with the tincture to the occiput and the sacral/lumbar joint,

<!-- chunk -->

### with the indication to lay down and relax for twenty minutes before

<!-- chunk -->

### taking off the pads. This usage is not only similar to that inaugurated by

<!-- chunk -->

### my friend, but bears some slight resemblance to the use of rosemary by

<!-- chunk -->

### Carlos Castaneda (below).

<!-- chunk -->

### Lest we missed anything to do with the head or brain, Culpeper

<!-- chunk -->

### enlightens us: “The decoction thereof in wine, helps the cold distillations

<!-- chunk -->

### of rheums into the eyes, and all other cold diseases of the head and

<!-- chunk -->

### brain, as the giddiness or swimmings therein, drowsiness or dullness of

<!-- chunk -->

### the mind and senses like a stupidness, the dumb palsy, or loss of speech,

<!-- chunk -->

### the lethargy and falling-sickness, to be drunk, and the temples bathed

<!-- chunk -->

### therewith. It helps the pains in the gums and teeth … causing an evil

<!-- chunk -->

### smell from them, or a stinking breath. It helps a weak memory, and

<!-- chunk -->

### quickens the senses.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary has an extremely ancient reputation in folklore as an herb

<!-- chunk -->

### for remembrance. It was used from ancient times down to the

<!-- chunk -->

### Renaissance as an emblem for fidelity between lovers. Ann of Cleves is

<!-- chunk -->

### supposed to have worn a wreath of rosemary around her head at her

<!-- chunk -->

### wedding to Henry VIII. Hopefully she was able to forget that marriage

<!-- chunk -->

### quickly. Shakespeare mentions it several times. And our dear friend,

<!-- chunk -->

### whom we hope not to forget, the late great herbalist William LeSassier,

<!-- chunk -->

### described rosemary as the remedy to help get rid of bad memories.

<!-- chunk -->

### Apropos of this, Amy Wallace, in Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2003, 111), her

<!-- chunk -->

### fascinating account of life with Carlos Castaneda, says that the latter

<!-- chunk -->

### recommended putting a poultice of rosemary on the genitals to remove

<!-- chunk -->

### the influence of past sexual experiences, an herbal technique he claimed

<!-- chunk -->

### to have gotten from don Juan.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dr. Rudolf Weiss gives a general picture of the person who responds to

<!-- chunk -->

### rosemary. Where there is chronic circulatory weakness, including low

<!-- chunk -->

### blood pressure, and especially in young people who are weak, thin, pale,

<!-- chunk -->

### and easily run-down, rosemary is indicated. It is also appropriate for

<!-- chunk -->

### older people with weak circulation, sometimes due to constitutional

<!-- chunk -->

### weakness but in many cases from overwork or following weakening

<!-- chunk -->

### diseases such as influenza or pneumonia. It stimulates the appetite and is

<!-- chunk -->

### especially indicated when atonic conditions of the stomach accompany

<!-- chunk -->

### poor circulation.

<!-- chunk -->

### Moving to the physiological level, Rose Elliot and Carlo di Paoli say

<!-- chunk -->

### that rosemary is indicated in a cold, sluggish liver and gall bladder

<!-- chunk -->

### condition, where there is a pale, yellowish complexion, slow digestion,

<!-- chunk -->

### bitter taste in the mouth, and lack of energy. It stimulates the arterial

<!-- chunk -->

### blood supply to the liver, promoting cleansing and burning, and

<!-- chunk -->

### generates more gall, which is more readily secreted. Australian herbalist

<!-- chunk -->

### Dorothy Hall recommends rosemary as a general tonic at the beginning

<!-- chunk -->

### of a case where there is need for increased detoxification, metabolism,

<!-- chunk -->

### and elimination.

<!-- chunk -->

### The stimulating volatile oils of rosemary act upon the stomach to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase secretion, remove gas, improve appetite, and renew function.

<!-- chunk -->

### They make their impression upon the autonomic nervous system, and

<!-- chunk -->

### hence upon the innervation and circulation of the abdominal viscera. “It

<!-- chunk -->

### is very comfortable to the stomach in all the cold maladies thereof: helps

<!-- chunk -->

### both retention of meat, and digestion,” says Culpeper (1652, 1994, 155).

<!-- chunk -->

### “It is a remedy for the windiness in the stomach, bowels, and spleen, and

<!-- chunk -->

### expels [wind] powerfully.” By “warming and comforting” the heat of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, “it helps all cold diseases, both of the head, stomach, liver, and

<!-- chunk -->

### belly.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Father Sebastian Kneipp gives similar testimony. “It cleanses the

<!-- chunk -->

### stomach from phlegm,” he says. “The stomach will soon become

<!-- chunk -->

### sensible, i.e., will not stick fast much longer in phlegm.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary has been used since the time of Dioscorides and Galen to

<!-- chunk -->

### decongest the liver and gall bladder and remove phlegm. It stimulates

<!-- chunk -->

### the arterial blood supply to the liver, promoting cleansing and burning

<!-- chunk -->

### processes. By increasing oxidation and burning processes throughout the

<!-- chunk -->

### body, excessive blood sugar is taken up. “Through this, all organs and

<!-- chunk -->

### organ systems are strengthened in their function, especially the

<!-- chunk -->

### constantly beating heart, which uses blood sugar all the time in vast

<!-- chunk -->

### amounts” (Gümbel).

<!-- chunk -->

### Through the circulation and nervous system, rosemary acts strongly on

<!-- chunk -->

### the heart. One of the most remarkable properties of rosemary is its

<!-- chunk -->

### effectiveness in treating serious cardiopulmonary edema. Father Kneipp

<!-- chunk -->

### speaks highly of it. “Rosemary-wine, taken in small doses, has also

<!-- chunk -->

### proved an excellent remedy against heart-infirmities. It operates in a

<!-- chunk -->

### sedative manner, and in cases of heart-dropsy it works strongly on

<!-- chunk -->

### removal through the urine. Such wine renders the same service in dropsy

<!-- chunk -->

### in general.”

<!-- chunk -->

### Father Sebastian Kneipp (1896, 201) gives several impressive accounts

<!-- chunk -->

### of Rosemary. “The whole body of a peasant woman about forty-eight

<!-- chunk -->

### years of age begins to swell; she is scarcely able to walk. The enervation

<!-- chunk -->

### is already great, breathing a great burden. I advised her immediately to

<!-- chunk -->

### put rosemary in wine and daily to drink two wine-glassfuls.” Externally,

<!-- chunk -->

### she applied warm water and vinegar poultices and half baths for the

<!-- chunk -->

### upper part of the body (evidently a heart-dropsy). “The peasant woman

<!-- chunk -->

### got well and was able to attend to her work entirely and unhindered.”

<!-- chunk -->

### This usage has continued down to the present time in Germany.

<!-- chunk -->

### Rosemary ointment is listed in the German pharmacopoeia for use in

<!-- chunk -->

### functional heart complaints, when it is rubbed into the chest. The spirit

<!-- chunk -->

### of Rosemary is used externally for arthritic complaints, neuralgia, and

<!-- chunk -->

### the heart. Dr. Rudolf Weiss recommends making an elixir from rosemary

<!-- chunk -->

### in white wine, preferably of southern European origin; Californian

<!-- chunk -->

### would work as well.

<!-- chunk -->

### I have seen rosemary work very nicely in several cases. One woman

<!-- chunk -->

### described the action to me succinctly. “I feel it tingling all over my body,

<!-- chunk -->

### in every cell, down to my toes. About fifteen minutes later I have to go

<!-- chunk -->

### to the bathroom. The difference between rosemary and lasix is that it is

<!-- chunk -->

### more selective. Lasix pumps out all the fluids it can get its hands on,

<!-- chunk -->

### whereas rosemary pulls out fluids that I can feel are stagnant and need

<!-- chunk -->

### to go.” She was suffering from chronic pulmonary edema caused by scar

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue and suffered an acute aggravation from burns caused by chlorine

<!-- chunk -->

### fumes.

<!-- chunk -->

### The influence of rosemary extends to the extremities. Nerves are

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulated, congealed blood is removed, and sensation is improved. This

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy is used to remove cold conditions from the limbs, including the

<!-- chunk -->

### stiffness and soreness resulting from undue muscular activity as well as

<!-- chunk -->

### that from arthritic conditions, bruises, and strains. The diluted oil, or an

<!-- chunk -->

### ointment, is “singularly good to help cold benumbed joints, sinews, or

<!-- chunk -->

### members” (Culpeper, 1994, 347). It is also used externally on the skin to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase activity and circulation. It improves the water-retentive

<!-- chunk -->

### qualities of the skin, stimulates heat-discharge through a better

<!-- chunk -->

### metabolism of fats and sugars, and nourishes the skin glands. It is

<!-- chunk -->

### indicated for a pale, cool skin with weak peripheral circulation

<!-- chunk -->

### (Gümbel).

<!-- chunk -->

### There are many ways to prepare and use rosemary. The diluted oil is

<!-- chunk -->

### used externally on the skin to increase activity and circulation. It

<!-- chunk -->

### improves the water-retentive qualities of the skin, stimulates heat-

<!-- chunk -->

### discharge through a better metabolism of fats and sugars, and nourishes

<!-- chunk -->

### the skin glands. It is indicated for a pale, poorly circulated, cool skin (Dr.

<!-- chunk -->

### Dietrich Gümbel, 1993). Keep the oil out of the eyes. Pouring a cup of

<!-- chunk -->

### boiling water over a tablespoon of the leaves and flowers makes the

<!-- chunk -->

### infusion. Keep the pot covered, so that the volatile oils do not escape

<!-- chunk -->

### from the vessel. Father Kneipp gives directions for making a simple,

<!-- chunk -->

### elegant tincture. “A handful of rosemary is cut up as small as possible,

<!-- chunk -->

### put into a bottle, and good, well-kept wine poured upon it; white wine is

<!-- chunk -->

### preferable. Even after half a day’s standing, it may be used” (Kniepp,

<!-- chunk -->

### 1896, 201). Rudolf Weiss (1988) adds that wines from southern

<!-- chunk -->

### countries, with a relatively high alcohol content, extract the active

<!-- chunk -->

### constituents best. Brandy, likewise a product of the vine, makes a fine

<!-- chunk -->

### tincture.

<!-- chunk -->

### And to close our account with our gallant astrological savant … “the

<!-- chunk -->

### Sun claims privilege in it, and it is under the celestial Ram,” proclaims

<!-- chunk -->

### Nicholas Culpeper (1994, 347). This is his metaphorical way of

<!-- chunk -->

### describing a strong, fixed, radiant warming and drying medicine. “The

<!-- chunk -->

### whole plant has a fragrant and aromatic smell: it is lighter and more

<!-- chunk -->

### delicate in the flower, and stronger in the leaves. The taste also is warm

<!-- chunk -->

### and aromatic, and not disagreeable.”

## Xanthoxylum americanum (Northern Prickly Ash)

<!-- chunk -->

### The bark or berry causes an intense tingling on the tongue and throat,

<!-- chunk -->

### which can quickly become torturous. This stimulating impression moves

<!-- chunk -->

### down the throat and through the body, awakening the nervous system,

<!-- chunk -->

### left and right. The physiomedicalists included it among their handful of

<!-- chunk -->

### diffusives, remedies that cause a diffusing sensation through the nerves. It

<!-- chunk -->

### is a powerful stimulant to the nervous system; it “equalizes the charge

<!-- chunk -->

### on the nerves,” so to speak. It is the superlative remedy for torture.

<!-- chunk -->

### I remember the first time I ever used prickly ash. The woman was

<!-- chunk -->

### literally writhing in agony as she tried to sit on the chair next to me. She

<!-- chunk -->

### had fallen down a stair and injured the sciatic. She begged the doctors to

<!-- chunk -->

### “cut it” (not knowing what this would have meant, evidently) but they

<!-- chunk -->

### rightly refused. Prickly ash bark tincture, three drops, as needed,

<!-- chunk -->

### brought the pain to a level where it was easily tolerable, though not

<!-- chunk -->

### completely eliminated. Another woman came over with a torn disc in

<!-- chunk -->

### the neck. She was literally writhing in agony. Her sixteen-year-old

<!-- chunk -->

### daughter had to drive her over. I felt sorry for both of them. It was a

<!-- chunk -->

### little frightening. I gave her a dose of prickly ash, a few drops, and she

<!-- chunk -->

### was relatively pain-free for five minutes. She had to take the tincture at

<!-- chunk -->

### five minute intervals for the first day or two, then less and less. The disc

<!-- chunk -->

### has never healed, she says, but the pain has never returned.

<!-- chunk -->

### Xanthoxylum was given a homeopathic proving and produced such

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms as a sensation as if the ovaries were being ripped out of the

<!-- chunk -->

### body by wires. I had a case where exactly this symptom appeared. The

<!-- chunk -->

### woman was thirty-nine, lived on welfare, and had just about been an

<!-- chunk -->

### invalid since age thirteen, when her menses started. Those were the days

<!-- chunk -->

### when one could still live on welfare. She had been going to a classical

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopath for several years, with no result. I gave her a bottle of prickly

<!-- chunk -->

### ash tincture and she brought it back six months later with a smile on her

<!-- chunk -->

### face. “Thanks for giving me my life back,” she said. And she did get it

<!-- chunk -->

### back—moved to Hollywood, became a make-up artist and had a new

<!-- chunk -->

### boyfriend. Before leaving she gave me a gift I still treasure, an old

<!-- chunk -->

### homeopathic kit from the nineteenth century.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prickly ash also produced symptoms of numbness, tingling, and pain

<!-- chunk -->

### in the nerves. It is an excellent remedy for nerve damage resulting in

<!-- chunk -->

### numbness, tingling, and pain. One of my friends gave it to a woman who

<!-- chunk -->

### had a numb spot on the side of the face for decades following a car

<!-- chunk -->

### accident. In one hour she could feel it again. One of the conditions for

<!-- chunk -->

### which prickly ash is considered remedial in homeopathic literature

<!-- chunk -->

### (Boericke, 1927) is hemiplegia, or one-sided paralysis (Bell’s palsy). I

<!-- chunk -->

### have seen it cure this condition. It “equalizes the charge on the nerves.”

<!-- chunk -->

### One side of the body becomes intensely painful while the other side is

<!-- chunk -->

### semi-paralyzed. This condition perfectly expresses the essence of prickly

<!-- chunk -->

### ash, which is a remedy for imbalance in the charge on the nerves. It will

<!-- chunk -->

### rectify conditions where the nerves have been injured, torn,

<!-- chunk -->

### overstimulated, are numb, tingling, torturously painful, and it will do it

<!-- chunk -->

### with a power that is hard to believe.

<!-- chunk -->

### A woman came to me who had been diagnosed with polymyositis, or

<!-- chunk -->

### muscular inflammation in various places. She had fallen down, folding

<!-- chunk -->

### her knee back and injuring it severely. After the swelling and bruising

<!-- chunk -->

### went down, she had routine orthoscopic surgery on the knee. The next

<!-- chunk -->

### day she felt pain all over her body. For the next two years she suffered in

<!-- chunk -->

### agony. To fight the pain she was on prednisone and other

<!-- chunk -->

### pharmaceutical anodynes. These weakened her immune system, causing

<!-- chunk -->

### an ulcerating skin eruption, which made her feel grotesque and unclean.

<!-- chunk -->

### “I used to love my life; now it is hell.” I asked her for the actual

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms of the so-called polymyositis, since I thought we would never

<!-- chunk -->

### cure the skin problem until she was off the drugs. The first three

<!-- chunk -->

### symptoms she listed were muscular weakness, tingling in different places

<!-- chunk -->

### around the body, and paralysis. It was especially hard to get up out of a

<!-- chunk -->

### chair or bathtub, or climb stairs, due to weakness in the knees. A more

<!-- chunk -->

### perfect description of symptoms calling for prickly ash could hardly be

<!-- chunk -->

### offered. These immediately reduced the pain—she was able to walk up a

<!-- chunk -->

### flight of stairs right then and there to prove it. As prickly ash continued

<!-- chunk -->

### to remove the pain I could not help but think that the diagnosis was

<!-- chunk -->

### wrong. Something like “neuritis” would have been more appropriate.

<!-- chunk -->

### Prickly ash bark is plenty strong in small doses: a few drops, several

<!-- chunk -->

### times a day.

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (bark) pungent, slightly warm, highly stimulating and diffusive.

<!-- chunk -->

### (fruit) pungent, warm, moderately stimulating and diffusive.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: depression.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: nerves.


<!-- chunk -->

### • Spare, withered women in late middle age, afflicted with chronic

<!-- chunk -->

### wasting diseases or robust, full persons with nerve injuries causing

<!-- chunk -->

### intense torment.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Writhing in agony, can’t sit still from the pain; torment of the most

<!-- chunk -->

### intense kind, bringing the patient to their knees.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Sore throat and respiratory tension and discomfort.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nerve damage; numb, tingling, painful.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Hemiplegia (Bell’s palsy); one-sided pain, numbness, paralysis.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Nerve debility, withered, weakness.

<!-- chunk -->

### • Deep respiratory infection, with debility and chronic illness.

<!-- chunk -->

## Literature: Traditional, homeopathic provings and clinical experience,

<!-- chunk -->

### Matthew Wood (1, 2, 4, 5, 6), William Boericke (1, 4, 5, 6), William

<!-- chunk -->

### LeSassier (7).

<!-- chunk -->

## Urtica dioeca, U. urens (Nettle, Nettles)

<!-- chunk -->

### This widespread weed is one of the fundamental remedies of Western

<!-- chunk -->

### folk herbalism. It is high in protein, vitamins, and minerals, so that it is

<!-- chunk -->

### an excellent all-around nutritive tonic. It is the most proteinaceous plant

<!-- chunk -->

### common in North America. It usually grows on old manure piles, septic

<!-- chunk -->

### fields, and in places where it is exposed to protein byproducts. As a

<!-- chunk -->

### stinging plant, nettle possesses stimulating properties.

<!-- chunk -->

### Nettle is one of the most generally useful plants in the pharmacopoeia.

<!-- chunk -->

### It acts on all constitutions. It feeds and builds up the thin and

<!-- chunk -->

### undernourished; counteracts the protein-sensitivity (allergies) of the

<!-- chunk -->

### medium pitta constitution; and helps remove excess stagnation of water

<!-- chunk -->

### and mucus in the thick kapha types.

<!-- chunk -->

### Yet, nettle also possesses a specific affinity and properties as well. It

<!-- chunk -->

### acts on the protein cycle throughout the body. It mildly desensitizes

<!-- chunk -->

### mucosa that are overly reactive to protein, i.e., allergic. It thus removes

<!-- chunk -->

### phlegm in the gastrointestinal tract generated for self-protection. It helps

<!-- chunk -->

### the liver build blood proteins, which keep the plasma inside the vessels.

<!-- chunk -->

### Without blood proteins, the fluids run out of the vasculature, the tissues

<!-- chunk -->

### become edematous, and there is low blood pressure. These are typical

<!-- chunk -->

### nettle symptoms. Australian herbalist Dorothy Hall and American

<!-- chunk -->

### nutritionist Bernard Jensen both considered nettles to be a specific

<!-- chunk -->

### remedy for low blood pressure. Nettles probably also helps the liver

<!-- chunk -->

### break down protein waste products. It certainly helps the system remove

<!-- chunk -->

### them, hence it is an old remedy for gout, arthritis, muscular soreness,

<!-- chunk -->

### tissue acidity, and kidney inactivity. The final goal of protein is to

<!-- chunk -->

### increase the “intelligence of the cells,” which depend on proteins—DNA,

<!-- chunk -->

### RNA. Nettles are thus also a specific restorative and stimulant, bringing

<!-- chunk -->

### back function to parts that have become paralyzed, atrophied, or

<!-- chunk -->

### functionally inactive. In the old days, the part paralyzed or arthritic or

<!-- chunk -->

### gouty was whipped with the fresh picked nettle. It is especially active

<!-- chunk -->

### when the part has been paralyzed since the use of anesthesia. It also

<!-- chunk -->

### works internally to get organs working when they have stopped

<!-- chunk -->

### functioning, such as inactive kidneys, thyroid, menstruation, hormones,

<!-- chunk -->

### nerves, muscles. Urtica is used homeopathically for burns, since it causes

<!-- chunk -->

### burning pain.

<!-- chunk -->

### The stimulating effects of nettle are reduced immediately after

<!-- chunk -->

### picking, so the best form of use is the freeze-dried capsule. However,

<!-- chunk -->

### some of the stimulating properties remain even in more slowly dried

<!-- chunk -->

### nettles. The nutritive effects are well represented by the slowly dried

<!-- chunk -->

### method of picking. The young shoots in the spring are especially good

<!-- chunk -->

### for medicine or food. The root is used for prostate problems. David

<!-- chunk -->

### Winston introduced the use of the seeds for kidney problems.

<!-- chunk -->

### I’ve had several amazing experiences with nettles. In one case a

<!-- chunk -->

### woman had atrophy of a muscle in the inner thigh which was making

<!-- chunk -->

### her lame and interfering with recovery from an injury. Nettles

<!-- chunk -->

### immediately improved her walk. I was actually flummoxed and nervous

<!-- chunk -->

### from the rapidity with which it worked. In another case, a student used

<!-- chunk -->

### nettle tea from her barnyard to restore her father’s kidneys and get him

<!-- chunk -->

### off dialysis. David Winston has collected other stories of the efficacy of

<!-- chunk -->

### nettle in kidney failure; he uses the seed. A man who had been paralyzed

<!-- chunk -->

### from the waist down, due to an accident, got so he could walk again

<!-- chunk -->

### through the use of herbs and acupuncture. Then he started walking in

<!-- chunk -->

### the old nettle patch on his farm until the sensation came back!

<!-- chunk -->

## Taste: (young shoots and leaves) sweet, bitter, salty/minerally,

<!-- chunk -->

### stimulating

<!-- chunk -->

## Tissue State: depression, atrophy, stagnation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Organ Affinities: liver, kidneys, muscles.
