capacity. Enuresis is overnight incontinence or bedwetting. Other, less common forms of urinary incontinence include continual inconti- nence and situational incontinence.

# GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

From the mid-1990s, the term lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was increasingly used for women and replaced with the term prostatism in men. In 2002 the International Continence Society (ICS) categorized the term overactive bladder syndrome or overactive bladder (OAB) to cover the increasingly more prevalent symptom picture of urinary urgency, with or without day frequency, nocturia, and urinary incontinence (Fig. 194.1). In the United States, the 2018 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes used to indicate a diagnosis for reimbursement purposes are as follows: R32 for unspecified urinary incontinence; N39.3 and N39.4 for stress incontinence and stress incontinence and other specific urinary incon- tinence, respectively; N39.44 for nocturnal enuresis; R35.0 for urinary frequency (micturition); F98.0) for nonorganic enuresis; and R39.81 for functional urinary incontinence, as well as urinary incontinence associ- ated with cognitive impairment. Other codes for symptoms and signs involving the genitourinary system in ICD-10-CM are found between R30 and R39. OAB with UUI is also called OAB wet, and OAB without UUI is also called OAB dry. With time, OAB dry tends to progress to OAB wet. OAB and UUI are considered to be due to overactivity or excessive neural stimulation of the detrusor muscle. This exces- sive contraction of the detrusor muscle results in the sensation of needing to void. Detrusor overactivity can be determined through urodynamic testing. SUI occurs when the pelvic floor muscles that support the organs and structures of the lower abdomen are weakened and fail to sup- port the internal and external urethral sphincters. The most common causes of stress incontinence among women are pregnancies involving multiple vaginal deliveries, during which time the sphincter and pelvic muscles are stretched and weakened. OAB and urinary incontinence (UI) are psychologically distress- ing conditions that negatively affect physical and emotional status and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in those affected, resulting in greatly increased healthcare costs.7–11 Millions of individuals world- wide are affected by UI, yet the associated embarrassment results in the condition being underreported and underdiagnosed. The prevalence of UI can be challenging to determine. Current esti- mates suggest it may be as high as one in five people with UI and 15% with OAB.11 The National Association for Continence estimates that 33 million Americans suffer from OAB, with 12.2 million experiencing concomitant urgency incontinence.2 The 2002 EPIC study included five Western countries (i.e., Canada, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) and demonstrated an average OAB prevalence of 11.8% (11% men and 13% women) and an Storage LUTSVoiding Slow or intermittent stream Straining Hestitation Feeling of incomplete emptying Post-micturition dribble NO LUTS25.3% 5.2% 22.4% 0.9% 14.8% 2.0% 3.6% 26.0% Voiding only Storage only Post-micturition only Voiding and storage Voiding and post-micturition Storage and post-micturition Voiding storage and post-micturition OAB – overactive bladder, DO – detrusor overactivity Detrusor underactivity (in women: undefined) Detrusor underactivity (in women: undefined) Post-micturition Distribution for LUTS as assessed in the EpiLUTS study indicating overlapping or nonoverlapping symptoms.

UI of 9.4%.10 Women are more likely to experience UI, predominantly SUI, whereas men more commonly experience UUI.12 Data analyzed on 17,580 adults surveyed in the 2001 and 2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that the prevalence of UI was 51.1% in women and 13.9% in men, with increasing prevalence rates observed for both men and women from the first survey to the sec- ond survey.13 In a 2010 prevalence study of incontinence in Australia, 4.2 million (19%) Australians aged 15 years and over had urinary inconti- nence, and 1.3 million had fecal incontinence, with an economic burden of AUS $42.9 billion, or approximately AUS $9014 per person.14 The prev- alence rate jumps much higher in the residential aged care community, where 70.9% were found to have urinary or fecal incontinence (or both), with the prevalence projected to rise to 250,000 by 2030.14 A 2009 population-based survey conducted to estimate the preva- lence rate of UI in China found the prevalence rate to be 22.1%, with SUI at 12.9%, UUI at 1.7%, and MUI at 7.5%).15 The authors of the China study concluded that UI is a common disorder in Chinese women owing to numerous risk factors besides pregnancy. In a cross-sectional survey that included 19,024 women, the overall prevalence rate of UI was 30.9%, with estimates of SUI, UUI, and MUI being 18.9%, 2.6%, and 9.4%, and a corresponding proportional distribution of 61%, 8%, and 31%, respectively.16 The study found that only 25% of women reported consulting health practitioners about this issue. In a randomly sampled prevalence survey performed in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China, 19.0% of women were found to have UI, with the prevalence of SUI, UUI, and MUI at 16.6%, 10.0%, and 7.7%, respectively.17 Prevalence increased significantly with age. It is not surprising that the prevalence of UI and OAB syndrome is lower in Occidental women, because women in China have given birth to fewer children in their lifetime.17 Many individuals with LUTS do not tell their doctor or even their partner about their condition.8 Women often view UI as a “normal” part of being female.18 Doctors do not often question about patients’ bladder control; 50% to 75% of incontinent community-dwelling patients never describe their symptoms to physicians.7,19 In a review paper on medical/surgical options and complications for women affected by UI, although 10% to 20% of women and up to 77% of those residing in nursing homes have UI, only 25% were found to seek or receive treatment for the condition.20 Individuals affected by UI tend to modify their lifestyle to cope, wearing adult pads/diapers/absorbent underwear and traveling no more than 1 hour at a time in case of the need to change the pad/ diaper or find a restroom. They tend to stop socializing and exercising for fear of having an accident in public, which negatively affects mental and cardiovascular health. They have increased issues with intimacy. Those affected often experience interrupted sleep and resultant day- time fatigue because of frequent nocturia. They typically stop visiting and staying overnight with family or friends for fear of having an acci- dent or disrupting people who may be asleep in the household. With time, sufferers can become reclusive and isolated and have a significant reduction in quality of life. Urinary incontinence is a leading cause of elderly admittance to nursing care. The etiology of male LUTS is multifactorial, with BPH being a common cause. However, in men, bladder dysfunction can occur independently of the prostate (Fig. 194.2). Less than 50% of cases of bladder dysfunction in men have urodynamically proven bladder outlet obstruction that may be attributed to BPH or other obstructive causes.9,21 A differential diagnosis of non–prostate-related OAB needs to be ruled out when assessing BPH symptoms. For men, the occurrence of LUTS, OAB, and UI increases with age. Research shows that 11% of men over the age of 40 have experienced a UI episode in the past year. For men over the age of 60 years, daily UI may be as high as 11%, and in men over the age of 80 years, daily UI is 32%.22 For women, UI affects approximately 25% at reproductive age, 50% postmenopause, and 50% to 75% of women in nursing homes.8,23 LUTS negatively affect HR-QOL and are associated with high healthcare costs.9,10,24 OAB and UI are highly prevalent and progress over time, and the severity of UI symptoms increases over time. The number of people affected by poor bladder control is comparable to the number affected by arthritis. In summary, the problem is widespread and affects people of all ages, including children and young adults. The National Association for Continence (NAFC) estimates that 25 million adult Americans experience transient or chronic UI, increasing to more than 50 million Americans when including OAB sufferers.2

## Causes/Contributing Factors

OAB: overactivity of the detrusor (bladder) muscle SUI: weakened pelvic floor (supporting) muscles

## Considerations (Causes, Contributing/Interacting Factors)

• Childbirth (40% of women suffer some form of leaking urine for many months after bearing children)25 • High body mass index (places strain on the pelvic floor) • Constipation and other bowel symptoms (places strain on the pel- vic floor) • History of surgery such as hysterectomy, prostatectomy, or pro- lapse repair26 • Increasing age • BPH (can lead to secondary OAB due to the strain on the bladder) • Diabetes mellitus (greater risk of developing OAB) • Stroke • Multiple sclerosis • Alzheimer’s disease • Parkinson’s disease • Poor bladder habits: urinating “just in case” before the bladder has sufficiently filled teaches the bladder that it can only hold a smaller volume of urine and needs to empty before completely necessary. • Waiting too long to urinate can also interfere with the natural blad- der-emptying signals. • Spinal cord injury • Medications (antihypertensives, heart medications, diuretics, mus- cle relaxants, antihistamines, sedatives, and antidepressants) • Bladder abnormalities, such as tumors or bladder stones • Declining cognitive function due to aging, which may make it more difficult for the bladder to understand the signals it receives from the brain • Poor mobility (can lead to urinary urgency) • High alcohol intake—more than 7 standard drinks/week • Age-related changes in the lower urinary tract • Urinary tract infection • Bladder cancer • Declining mental health and depression Addressing the underlying disease is the most effective treatment; however, the cause of OAB and/or UI often cannot be determined. Chemical irritants, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), acid, turpentine, mustard oil, croton oil, and acrolein, directly dam- age the urothelium and other cells of the bladder, resulting in various degrees of erosion of the mucosa, edema, hemorrhage, and leukocyte infiltration of the bladder wall.27 Although the cause of chronic bladder pain is yet unknown, it is plausible that irritants may contribute to the etiology. The elderly may have combined difficulty with bladder-storage problems and bladder emptying. Incomplete emptying may exacerbate urgency, and OAB may require specialist assessment.

## 1536SECTION 6 Diseases


Due to the underreporting of bladder symptoms, it is important that ques- tions about bladder control, frequency, urgency, and nocturia are included in the initial naturopathic consultation. A thorough history needs to be taken to identify possible causes of LUTS and associated comorbidities, including medications that may contribute to hyperactivity of the bladder.

## LUTS Questionnaires

Refer to the LUTS chart at the start of this chapter, undertake a differ- ential diagnosis, and then provide a referral if required. A bladder symptom diary can capture fluid intake and urinary fre- quency, urinary urgency, incontinence, nocturia, and enuresis; assist in diagnosis; and serve as a record to gauge improvement with treatment (see Fig. 194.3). Validated quality-of-life questionnaires for overactive bladder are available and are useful to track improvement with treatment (e.g., Overactive Bladder Short Form [OAB-SF], Urinary Distress Inventory [UDI], and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire [IIQ] questionnaires; see Figs. 194.4–194.6). Referral to a urinary specialist may be required to complete the physical examination of the abdomen and external genitalia and digital

## Anticholinergic/Antimuscarinic and Beta 3-Adrenergic

<!-- chunk -->

## Agonists

Acetylcholine is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in bladder emptying. The two medication classes commonly used are anti- cholinergic/antimuscarinic (e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin) and beta 3-adrenergic agonists (e.g., mirabegron). These medications reduce symptoms of OAB and UI with variable outcomes.29,30 A study found that prescribing of medications with anticholinergic prop- erties to nursing home residents is common, despite “an association with an increased risk of falls, delirium, and other [adverse] outcomes.”31 A systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials between 1966 and 2011 evaluating fesoterodine, tolterodine, oxybu- tynin, solifenacin, and trospium concluded that approximately 13% of participants achieved continence, and approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment due to the severity of adverse effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision, drowsiness, and cognitive issues such as confusion and memory loss).32 Improved quality of life was limited. The newer medications, such as darifenacin, solifenacin, and tro- spium, are more targeted for bladder tissue, whereas transdermal delivery systems still produce unwanted anticholinergic effects in tis- sues other than the bladder.32 Significantly, a growing body of research shows a positive associa- tion between anticholinergic/antimuscarinic medications and memory

loss that was originally thought to be temporal in nature. One reported study in JAMA highlighted the negative effect of these medications on dementia. A 2018 BMJ study that analyzed 40,770 patients aged 65 to 99 with a diagnosis of dementia between April 2006 and July 2015, compared with 283,933 controls without dementia, found that the use of anticholinergics is associated with impaired cognition in the short term and in the long term was linked to increased risk of dementia inci- dence, with associations persisting up to 20 years after exposure.33,34 Mirabegron, a drug used to treat OAB, is a beta-3 adrenergic agonist that activates the beta-3 adrenergic receptor in the detrusor muscle in the bladder, which can lead to muscle relaxation and increased bladder capacity.35 Postsurveillance data show side effects, including elevated blood pressure (hypertension) in more than 10% of individuals, and in 1% to 10% of users, side effects include nasopharyngitis, UTI, dry mouth, joint pain, cystitis, back pain, upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, headache, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation, tachycardia, and urinary retention.36 The overall incidence of drug-related adverse events reported in a randomized clinical trial of mirabegron was 15.8%.37

## Botox

Sacral nerve stimulation and OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Dysport, Xeomin) are options prescribed by some physicians for UI and OAB. The rationale proposed for the use of OnabotulinumtoxinA involves the drug’s ability to inhibit the calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine vesicles at the presynaptic neuromuscular junction in peripheral nerve endings, resulting in temporary flaccid paralysis of the bladder muscle.38 Botox is the most commonly known drug of the seven antigenically distinct forms of botulinum toxin.39 In one study, 35 patients (29 women; 6 men) with symptoms of bladder frequency, urgency, and/or urge incontinence in whom previous anticholinergic therapy had failed were administered 300 U of botulinum-A toxin injected transurethrally at 30 sites within the bladder.40 Of participants, 60% experienced improvement in UDI and IIQ scores and a slight to complete improvement in bladder symptoms by weeks that lasted for up to 6 months. Thereafter, a repeat of the procedure would be needed, and as often as needed, in the hope of a lasting resolu- tion. Mild hematuria, pelvic pain, and dysuria were experienced in 20% of participants. Urinary retention, UTI, hematuria, insomnia, and fatigue fol- lowing Botox injections are the most common serious side effects reported within the initial 12 weeks after injections are administered.

## Surgery

More invasive therapies include surgery with augmentation cystoplasty or detrusor myectomy (removing part or all of the outer muscle layer surrounding the bladder). Detrusor myectomy has been used for years for bladder augmentation in treating refractory detrusor overactivity.41 This procedure may improve the compliance of the bladder to limit or prevent upper tract damage due to high bladder pressures. In a 1-year postsurgical follow-up of detrusor myectomy for detrusor overactiv- ity, 17 of 27 patients studied experience an overall improvement, with those with idiopathic instability (12 of 17) experiencing a higher rate of success.42 In a 2-year follow-up study of detrusor myectomy, it was found to be successful in nearly 80% of patients with idiopathic detru- sor overactivity in a review of 30 consecutive patients, although “detru- sor contractility is affected in most and almost half of the patients required clean intermittent self-catheterization afterward,” with 45% of patients needing to start clean intermittent self-catheterization after surgery.43 Sling procedures, bulking injections (such as certain colla- gens), and other surgical procedures support or move the bladder to improve continence. Selective bladder denervation to treat OAB syndrome using radiofrequency ablation is also an option,44 and the tension-free vaginal tape procedure in women with stress UI can be performed as yet another option, although “the possibility of per- sistent overactive bladder symptoms” following treatment should be considered.45

## Physical Therapy

## Pelvic Muscle Rehabilitation

<!-- chunk -->

## Pelvic floor muscle or Kegel exercises (see Box 194.1). Arnold

Kegel first advocated pelvic floor muscle strengthening and retraining to treat SUI. Kegel’s program has shown some promise.46,47 Regular, daily exercising of pelvic floor muscles can improve, and even prevent, SUI and MUI. This is particularly helpful for younger women.48 A specialist physiotherapist or physical therapist can help ensure Kegel exercises are being performed correctly. Research supports the effectiveness of home-based Kegel exercises, with no supervision, for SUI and MUI. In one study, 72 women with urodynamically proven UI were divided into SUI and MUI groups.49 The women undertook Kegel exercise, consisting of 10 repetitions of 10 sets of contractions/day, for at least 8 weeks. There were statisti- cally significant improvements in both IIQ and UDI scores, with better results in the SUI group than in the MUI group.

## Vaginal weight training. Small weights are held within the vagina

by tightening the vaginal muscles. This exercise should be performed for 15 minutes, twice daily, for 4 to 6 weeks before effectiveness can be assessed.

<!-- chunk -->

## Biofeedback

Used in conjunction with Kegel exercises, biofeedback using sensors to detect if the muscles are contracting helps the individual gain aware- ness and control of the pelvic floor muscles.

<!-- chunk -->

## Pelvic Floor Electrical and Magnetic Stimulation

In this type of therapy, mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle con- tractions. This stimulation is best used in conjunction with Kegel exercises.

<!-- chunk -->

## Posture

General good posture helps to support the inner and outer abdom- inal muscles to position correctly and, thereby, also the pelvic floor muscles. During urination, changes in posture can help with more complete bladder emptying. After urination feels complete, struc- turally (with a straight back), bend forward after urination to move the position of bladder so that it is more likely to be above the urethral sphincter. This may help to eliminate any residual urine volume.

## Neural Reflex for Overactive Bladder

Plantar flexion (or pressing the toes into the ground) stimulates the tibial nerve and setting off a somatovesical neural reflex to the bladder, reducing the symptom of urinary urgency.

## Behavioral Therapy

<!-- chunk -->

## Bladder Retraining

Bladder retraining (see Box 194.2) teaches the bladder to adequately fill and then empty. It involves modifying habits of urinating too much, “just in case,” and teaches people to resist the urge to void and, over time, extend the timeframe between voids. A schedule for voiding is developed to allow the person to resist the urge and develop more control over the urge. The mechanisms to explain how bladder training works, when it does, are not fully understood. However, the behavioral interventions that have been reported to have some benefit in managing urinary symp- toms to promote bladder health include habit (lifestyle) changes and training techniques. The former is discussed in the section on lifestyle. Behavioral interventions using training techniques to manage symp- toms would include urgency control methods that incorporate deep breathing and mental tasks that try to delay or ignore urgency, bladder training that progressively increases the intervals between voidings and timing to urination, pelvic floor muscle training, and delayed voiding through progressive increases between the onset of urgency and voiding. Although a 1999 study reported in Neurourology Urodynamics failed to find any objective benefit of behavioral therapy and bladder training or pelvic floor muscle training by itself, or a combination training pro- gram of both, on urodynamic parameters in women with UI, subjec- tive reports by participants indicated that some improvement occurred immediately after treatment.51,52

## Crateva nurvala/Crateva magna (Varuna, Three-Leaf Caper)

Crateva is documented in traditional Ayurvedic herbal texts and in research as effective for improving and normalizing the tone of the bladder wall (as assessed by cystometric studies), beneficial for neu- rogenic bladder and postprostatectomic atony of the bladder.53–58 Crateva can benefit men with hypotonic bladder due to BPH and decreases residual urine volume. Research with dogs shows that Crateva increases the tone of both smooth and skeletal muscle in vitro. Forty days of treatment with Crateva resulted in hypertonic curves of the urinary bladder compared with initial curves.53,58

## Equisetum arvense (Horsetail)

Western herbal medicine traditionally recommends Equisetum arvense as a genito-urinary astringent, likely due to the silica content, for UI and enuresis in children.58,59 Equisetum has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antilithogenic effects.60,61 Note that Equisteum extracted with alcohol or heat will destroy the naturally occurring thiaminase.

## Crateva and Equisetum Combined

A randomized controlled trial with 120 male and female participants using a proprietary blend of C. nurvala (equivalent to 6000 mg dry bark) and E. arvense (equivalent to 3000 mg dry herb) resulted in sta- tistically significant reductions in day frequency and UI and improved quality of life within 2 months of treatment; however, dropout was high (23%).62 There were no anticholinergic side effects.

## Urox (Crateva, Equisetum, and Lindera)

Urox is a proprietary blend of concentrated extracts of Crateva, Equisetum, and Lindera. An 8-week randomized controlled trial with 150 male and female participants showed that 840 mg Urox daily resulted in significant reductions in day frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and UI.64 Results showed that by 8 weeks, 60% of participants had returned to normal day frequency (8 or fewer micturitions/day); nocturia inci- dence halved, with 24% of participants experiencing normal night- time urination; 20% were free from urinary urgency; and 23% had resolution of their UI (both SUI and UUI). A corresponding reduction in adult diaper/pad usage occurred for 75% of study participants. The correlated benefits of less interrupted sleep were also considered clin- ically relevant. There were significant improvements in HR-QOL. No anticholinergic/antimuscarinic side effects were observed, and no side effects resulted in withdrawal from the study. Urox produces faster and better results for OAB and UI than any other herbal assessed in randomized controlled research. Urox is the only herbal shown to produce statistically significant reductions in both SUI and UUI in both men and women.

## Pumpkin Seed (Cucurbita pepo) and Soy

Pumpkin seeds contain zinc and act as 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors to assist with bladder symptoms associated with BPH and prostate health. Soy is typically recommended for hormone-balancing effects. A 12-week randomized controlled trial in 120 women with LUTS of OAB participated in this study to assess the effectiveness of Cucuflavone (97.5% pumpkin seed extract, EFLA 940 and 12.5% soy germ, SOYLIFE 40 combination).65 The daily dosage equated to mg pumpkin seed extract and 125 mg soy germ extract for 12 weeks. Urinary frequency reached the normal range by 12 weeks, nocturia was reduced by 31%, and urinary urgency was reduced by 31%. There was a 30% dropout rate, which might have been due to the length of time for symptoms to improve. There was no statistically significant improvement in UI symptoms.

## Angelica archangelica (Garden Angelica, Wild Celery)

Angelica archangelica is recommended for bladder control and has a large usage in Europe. An 8-week randomized trial with men (n = 69) using two tablets daily of A. archangelica (Sagapro) was assessed for its effects on nocturnal bladder symptoms.66 There was no significant reduction in overall nocturia, although subgroup analysis of only those with a decreased bladder capacity reached significance. Men with BPH were included, which may explain some of the variations in results.

## Vaccinium macrocarpon (Cranberry)

Cranberry is typically recommended for UTI. A randomized controlled trial in 69 male participants assessed the effectiveness of 1500 mg whole cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) fruit powder for 6 months in men with both LUTS and nonbacterial prostatitis.67 These men did not fit the typical picture of OAB or UI, although results showed a statistically significant reduction for urinary urgency at 3 and 6 months and for frequency and nocturia at 6 months.

## Hachi-mi-jio-gan. Hachi-mi-jio-gan extract (Harncare; HE)

contains the ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbal mixture Ba-Wei-Die-Huang-Wan. The daily dose contains 4.4 g of the eight-ingredient formula with concentrated extracts equivalent to the following: • Rehmannia glutinosa root 5 g • Cornus fruit 3 g • Dioscorea rhizome 3 g • Alismatis rhizome 3 g • Moutan bark 3 g • Cinnamon bark 1 g • Hoelen (Poria cocus) 3 g • Heat-processed lateral root of aconite 1 g

<!-- chunk -->

## Gosha-jinki-gan. Gosha-jinki-gan (GJG) contains the same type

and amount of concentrated extracts as Hachi-mi-jio-gan, with the addition of two concentrated extracts equivalent to Achyranthis Radix (3 g) and Plantaginis Semen (3 g). An observational study assessed the effectiveness of 7.5 g/day GJG for 8 weeks in 44 Japanese women diagnosed with OAB. Urinary fre- quency, nocturia, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) index scores, and HR-QOL index scores were all significantly reduced, with adverse reactions observed in 9%.68 Rat studies have confirmed that GJG partially reduces the tachy- kinins and TRPV1 and P2X3 purine receptors (receptors responsi- ble for hypersensitivity) in the bladder without destroying the nerve fibers.69 GJG has an inhibitory effect on the bladder and main- tains the balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.70 A study with 45 female rats assessing the mechanism of Harncare showed that it reduced the bladder expression of tachykinins and P2X3 and TRPV1 receptors and inhibited adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ‐ induced detrusor overactivity, which may explain part of its beneficial effects on LUTS.71 Further rat studies showed that treatment with Harncare for weeks significantly inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the ace- tylcholine-induced contraction of isolated rat bladder strips, with a 7-times-greater affinity for purinergic receptors than for muscarinic and 1,4-DHP receptors, with little or no effect on the level and activity of hepatic CYP, which would indicate minimal pharmacokinetic inter- action with drugs.72 Sixty male participants with LUTS and cold sensitivity and who were unresponsive to alpha-1 blockers or antimuscarinic drugs were given either a mixture of Harncare or GJG for 12 weeks in addition to alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blockers or antimuscarinic drugs as add-on therapy. The IPSS and HR-QOL scores, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index score, and the number of nocturnal voids were statistically much improved, with no change in maximal urinary flow rate and postvoid residual urine. Mild adverse reactions were observed in 8.3% of patients.73 Both Harncare and GJG mixtures seem safe and effective poten- tial therapeutic alternatives in patients with LUTS and cold sensitivity unresponsive to alpha-1 blockers or antimuscarinic drugs.

## Alpinia oxyphylla

Alpinia oxyphylla (Zingiberaceae) is a Chinese medicinal herb, and the fruit is commonly used in TCM for the treatment of LUTS of OAB. In vitro testing of 95% ethanol extract of the capsular fruits exhibited significant dose-dependent antimuscarinic activ- ity against carbachol-induced contraction of the rat detrusor muscle.74

## Dietary/Nutritional

Minerals play an important role in connective tissue structural integ- rity and neuromuscular signaling. Magnesium at therapeutic doses can be of benefit in OAB, as may calcium. Forty women who had sensory urgency or detrusor instability participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the effect of magnesium hydroxide or placebo on symptoms, frequency/volume changes, and cystometric results. Magnesium was well tolerated, and 11 of 20 subjects in the magnesium group reported subjective improvements, compared with only 5 taking placebo, yet there was no statistically significant improvement in pre- and posttreat- ment urodynamic parameters.75 A better-absorbed form of magnesium, such as chelate, orotate, or diglycinate, is recommended. Regarding whether magnesium and calcium serum levels are different in women with detrusor overactivity or urodynamic stress incontinence, investiga- tion of blood levels determined there were no differences.76


Bladder stimulants include diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol, and bladder irritants include certain acidic fruits, spices, and tomato-based products. When 10 studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials, were analyzed to examine the role of the diet in OAB, the analysis found that “diet seems to have an impact on OAB, particularly caffeine con- sumption, which increases storage symptoms.”77 Similar results were found in a study of caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks, which concluded that “in addition to fluid intake, there is some evidence to support a role of caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages in the pathogenesis of OAB and lower urinary tract dysfunction.”78 Hence, caffeine has been the subject of studies on its effects on UI in women. In a study conducted in the United States of women who participated in the 2005 to 2006 and 2007 to 2008 NHANES, a cross-sectional nationally representative survey, the U.S. prevalence for any UI was 41.0%, and the prevalence was 16.5% for moderate/ severe UI, with SUI being the most common UI type (36.6%). The women surveyed consumed a mean caffeine intake of 126 mg a day. Caffeine intake equal to or exceeding 204 mg a day was associated with any UI, but not moderate/severe UI, after controlling for multiple fac- tors.79 An 8-oz cup of brewed coffee can contain from 95 to 165 mg of caffeine per cup, whereas a 12-oz serving of a carbonated cola soda can contain as much as 46 mg of caffeine. An 8-oz energy drink can contain from 27 to 164 mg of caffeine, and an “energy shot” can contain 40 to 100 mg per ounce.80 By comparison, in a survey of men aged 20 years or older, a significant association was found between caffeine intake and moderate to severe UI. Men with a caffeine intake at the upper 75th percentile (234 mg or more a day) and 90th percentile (392 mg or more per day) were significantly more likely to experience moderate to severe UI even after adjusting for prostate condition.81 These findings support the need to reduce caffeine intake in men with UI. Nevertheless, quite the opposite conclusion was reported after a meta-analysis of observational studies examining the association between coffee and caffeine intake and the risk of UI. The meta-analysis found “no evidence for an association between coffee/caffeine consumption and the risk of UI.”82 Similarly, a prospective cohort study in 21,564 women with moderate UI enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II did not find an asso- ciation between the risk of UI progression over 2 years among women with moderate incontinence, even when comparing women consuming 450 mg or more to those consuming 150 mg or less of caffeine per day.83 The study did not examine the acute effects of caffeine on UI. Potential foods known to be bladder irritants include: • Coffee, tea, and chocolate (containing caffeine, a diuretic) • Alcohol (diuretic)

## 1543CHAPTER 194 Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, Overactive Bladder Syndrome

• Carbonated drinks • Artificial sweeteners (e.g., aspartame [NutraSweet], saccharin), corn sweeteners, fructose • Acidic fruits and juices, including lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange • Spicy foods (e.g., chili) • Watermelon • Tomato-based products (e.g., tomato juice) It is recommended to remove them from the diet and then, after 2 weeks, slowly and individually reintroduce each food to determine whether it is contributing to bladder symptoms. Additional common foods that have been reported to be bladder irritants include apples and apple juice, cantaloupe, citrus fruits, cranberries and cranberry juice, grapes, guava, cow’s milk and its by-products (cheese, cottage cheese, ice cream, yogurt), peaches, pineapples, plums, strawberries, sugar (sucrose), and vinegar.84,85 This list of possible bladder irritants includes foods that may or may not affect a patient’s bladder symptoms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Fluid

With age, the thirst reflex reduces. Many individuals with OAB and UI restrict their water intake to help manage their condition. It is import- ant to maintain a fluid intake of 1.5 to 2 L/day and manage bladder control through healthy bladder habits and supplements. Dehydration may cause additional strain on the kidneys and bladder.

<!-- chunk -->

## Medications That Increase Urgency

There are medications that can increase the frequency or urgency to urinate. Among them are antihypertensives and medications to reduce muscular pain (relaxants). Among the medications to treat hypertension are diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide; alpha-antag- onists, including doxazosin maleate and prazosin; and angiotensin-con- verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril maleate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lifestyle

Habit changes involve lifestyle modifications. Modifications include changes in diet, fluid intake, and food and beverage choices; weight management; and smoking cessation. Lifestyle changes can also include timed voiding using a bladder diary. Increasing age is a risk factor for OAB and UI; however, most risk factors are modifiable, including the following: • Excess weight; obesity86 • Lack of physical activity86 • Smoking86 • Stress2 • Heavy alcohol intake (more than 7 standard drinks per week)2 • Caffeine, a dietary diuretic that can increase urinary frequency • Constipation (pressure and bearing down) • Vertebral misalignment • Medications (antihypertensives, heart medications, diuretics, mus- cle relaxants, antihistamines, sedatives, and antidepressants) Elderly individuals may have combined difficulty with bladder stor- age problems and bladder emptying. Incomplete emptying may exac- erbate urgency and OAB and may require specialist assessment. Erectile dysfunction is correlated with LUTS, but no evidence has been produced that shows a causal relationship. Preclinical evidence that both develop due to several common pathophysiological mecha- nisms has been proposed.87 It is important for practitioners to discuss sexual function in male patients presenting for LUTS because epidemiological evidence, based on well-powered multivariate analyses, provides compelling evidence of an association between LUTS and erectile dysfunction in men. This is even more important to discuss with the patient because men with LUTS have an increased risk of all-cause mortality, particularly for older males with nocturia.88

## Hypnotherapy

Hypnotherapy may be of benefit based on the early work of Freeman and Baxby reported in 1982.89 In their study, 50 incontinent women with detrusor instability completed 12 sessions of hypnotherapy over a 1-month period. Thereafter, the patients continued the treatment using a prere- corded cassette tape and were followed up for at least 6 months. Of the 50 patients, 29 claimed to be entirely symptom-free, 6 showed no objec- tive improvement, and 14 reported some improvement. Well-controlled clinical studies of the efficacy of hypnotherapy are lacking, although case histories continue to appear in the literature attesting to its benefit.90

## Physiotherapy

Specialist physiotherapists can correctly instruct for Kegel/pelvic floor exercises and posture during urination and can assist with any struc- tural contributing factors. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial compared physiotherapy to midurethral-sling surgery in women with SUI.91 In the study, 230 women were randomly assigned to the physio- therapy group and an equal number to the surgery group. Forty-nine percent of the women in the physiotherapy group and 11.2% of the women in the surgery group crossed over to the other treatment. Using an intention-to-treat analysis that analyzed the outcome for all partic- ipants (including those who dropped out of the study before complet- ing the assigned group), “subject improvement was reported by 90.8% of women in the surgery group and 64.4% of women in the physiother- apy group” after 1 year. The rates of subjective resolution were 85.2% in the surgery group and 53.4% in the physiotherapy group, and the rates of an objective “cure” were 76.5% and 58.8%, respectively. These results are associated with the broad variation in the rates of success for physiotherapy reported in the literature, which vary from 53% to 97% when measuring subjective success and from 5% to 49% when measured by objective means.92


To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for SUI in adults, a review was performed, and the results of randomized and quasi-randomized con- trolled trials were analyzed.93 The analysis of the studies selected for inclu- sion in the review was not conclusive as to whether acupuncture in adults with SUI was more effective than medications or other treatment options. Another approach taken to assess the efficacy of acupuncture was undertaken by experts in acupuncture familiar with the ancient litera- ture in the 4th edition of the Canon of Chinese Medicine that discusses the use of acupuncture for urinary incontinence. This led to the review- ers identifying 356 articles reporting on the use of this treatment for UI involving 41 acupoints. The results of this group analysis showed that “urinary incontinence belongs to external genitalia diseases, which should be treated from yin, indicating more yin-meridians be used and special acupoints be focused on.”94 A randomized, multicenter clinical trial to determine the efficacy of electroacupuncture in the treatment of SUI in women, compared with pelvic floor muscle training, is under- way in China, but the results are unknown at this time. A description of the study is published.95 A randomized controlled trial involved 240 women with OAB using weekly acupuncture compared with daily oral tolterodine tartrate 2 mg twice daily, over 4 weeks. Both groups showed statistically significant decreases in urinary urgency, UI, urinary frequency, and nocturia and an increase in volume voided per micturition. There was no difference in the changes in OAB symptoms between groups.74

## Chiropractic

Vertebral misalignment can contribute to poor bladder control, and if appropriate, chiropractic treatment can be beneficial. Current obser- vations by chiropractors indicate that some patients with SUI may have imbalances in several lumbopelvic muscles that inhibit the pelvic floor muscles and joints, leading to incontinence.96 Comorbidities between incontinence, lumbopelvic pain, and breathing difficulties have also been suggested. 96,97 A retrospective case-series study using chiropractic management of UI that included 21 women, 13 to 90 years of age, with UI found that 13 patients had lumbosacral dysfunction. Chiropractic manipu- lative (high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation; Cox flexion dis- traction manipulation; and/or use of percussion instrument treatment for myofascial trigger points) and soft tissue treatments were used to address soft tissue and articular dysfunctions. UI symptoms resolved in 10 patients, 7 improved, and 4 showed only slight improvement.98 Case studies reporting on the resolution of various bladder-related disorders abound in the literature. In one case, a 13-year-old female developed unpredictable UI and right hip pain immediately after emer- gency open appendectomy surgery. The UI persisted for 10 months, forcing the patient to wear a pad throughout the day and night. A com- bination of chiropractic therapy and applied kinesiology methods was used to diagnose and treat the patient. Muscle impairments were iden- tified in the lumbar spine and pelvis, which, upon treatment, resulted in rapid resolution of UI and hip pain. A 6-year follow-up confirmed continued resolution.99

## Therapeutic Approach

A key aspect of the therapeutic approach for patients suffering any of the forms of LUTS, OAB, and UI is fully exploring and eliminating as many causative, irritant, or contributing factors as possible. Eliminate or find alternatives for any drug that may aggravate. Weight should be achieved.


Reduce bladder stimulants, including diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol, and bladder irritants, such as certain acidic fruits, spices, and tomato-based products, to determine whether there is an improve- ment in symptoms. Gradually reintroduce foods to determine which are problematic. Ensure adequate fluid intake.

## Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Wet ARMD is also known as the neovascular form or advanced ARMD. It affects 5% to 20% of persons with ARMD. Wet ARMD is charac- terized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels. A common early symptom of wet ARMD is straight lines that appear wavy. Because the disease can rapidly progress to a point at which surgery cannot be used, treatment should begin as soon as possible. Wet ARMD can be treated quite effectively in the early stages with laser photocoagulation therapy. Photodynamic therapy using photo- sensitive drugs (verteporfin) and a low-powered laser or low-dose radi- ation therapy are also alternatives.6,7 Antiangiogenics or anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are also used. These drugs can cause regression of the abnormal blood vessels and improve- ment of vision when injected directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. The injections have to be repeated on a monthly or bimonthly basis. Examples of these agents include ranibizumab (Lucentis), beva- cizumab (Avastin), and pegaptanib (Macugen).1,2


The primary treatment goal of the dry form and prevention of the wet form of ARMD involve the use of antioxidants and natural substances that correct the underlying pathophysiology—free-radical damage and poor oxygenation of the macula. This can be accomplished by reduc- ing the risk factors for ARMD, focusing on preventive factors against atherosclerosis, increasing dietary intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, and supplementing with nutritional and botanical antioxidants. In particular, tobacco smoking greatly increases the risk of ARMD.8 Smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for any significant length of time increases the risk for ARMD by two to three times compared with someone who has never smoked.8,9 This risk does not return to the control rate until a person has stopped smoking for 15 years.9 There is also a strong genetic component to consider. Although a number of genetic markers have been identified, a family history may be the most convenient screening method. The lifetime risk of developing late-stage macular degeneration is 50% for people who have a relative with macular degeneration versus 12% for people who do not, a fourfold higher risk. Although genomic family scans of 364 families have revealed a region of chromosome 10 as possibly containing an association with ARMD,10 diversity in phenotype and the late onset of disease complicate the feasibility of linkage studies. Interestingly, a higher birth weight and a lower ratio of head cir- cumference to birth weight are associated with significantly higher risk.11

## Reducing and Preventing Atherosclerosis

Although atherosclerosis is now a well-accepted risk factor for mac- ular degeneration, this association was unconfirmed until 1995.12 In the confirmation study, 104 subjects with macular degeneration and 1324 subjects without macular degeneration were evaluated for ath- erosclerosis via ultrasonographic determination of the intimal-me- dial thickness, assessed for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries, and measured for the ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio (an indicator of peripheral atherosclerosis). The results indicated that in subjects younger than 85 years, plaques in the carotid bifurcation were associated with a 4.7-times-higher prev- alence of macular degeneration. Lower-extremity atherosclerosis was associated with a 2.5-times-greater risk. These results indicated that measures designed to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis are of great significance in the prevention and treatment of macular degenera- tion (see Chapter 149 for a comprehensive program for prevention and reversal).


A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk for ARMD. This protection is the result of a greater intake of antioxidant vitamins and minerals.13–15 However, various food components, such as flavonoids and the non–provitamin A carotenes lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene, may be more significant in protecting against ARMD than traditional nutritional antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E, zinc, and selenium). The macula, especially its central portion, the fovea, owes its yellow color to its high concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin. These yellow carotenoids function in preventing oxidative damage to the area of the retina responsible for fine vision and have a central role in protecting against the development of macular degeneration.16,17 The carotene lycopene, a component of tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables, is also protective. In one study, individuals with lycopene content in the lowest quintile were twice as likely to have ARMD.15 In addition, moderate wine consumption is associated with a decreased risk of ARMD.18 Red wine contains anthocyanins, which are powerful antioxidants and likely responsible for the protective effect. It is important to note that beer consumption increased the accumula- tion of drusen and the risk of exudative macular disease and therefore should be avoided.19 Similar to atherosclerosis, the type of dietary fat appears to play a role in ARMD. A cohort study of 261 individuals with early or inter- mediate stages of ARMD revealed a twofold increased risk of progres- sion with a high intake of animal fats and processed baked goods. In contrast, increased intake of fish and nuts was associated with a lower risk of ARMD progression.20 The intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids reduces the incidence of ARMD and was shown to be inversely associated with the 12-year progression to ARMD.21–23


In addition to recommending a diet high in antioxidants, supple- mentation with nutritional antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C, selenium, beta-carotene, and vitamin E) is certainly important in the treatment and prevention of macular degeneration. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) research group confirmed that a combination of these nutrients will likely produce better results than any single nutrient alone.24 The specific daily amounts of antioxidants and zinc used by the study researchers were 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, 15 mg of beta-carotene (often labeled as equivalent to 25,000 IU of vitamin A), 80 mg of zinc as zinc oxide, and 2 mg of copper as cupric oxide. It was further shown that a deficiency in any one of these anti- oxidants alone does not account for the impaired antioxidant status in ARMD. Instead, the lower antioxidant status reflects decreases in a combination of nutrients.10 The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 assessed the value of substituting lutein/zeaxanthin in the AREDS formulation and found that participants taking lutein/zeaxanthin had a slightly lower progression rate to late ARMD than participants not taking lutein/zeaxanthin.25 In fact, the totality of evidence on benefi- cial and adverse effects suggests that lutein/zeaxanthin could be more appropriate than beta-carotene in the AREDS-type supplements. A 2017 Cochrane review assessed the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation on the progression of ARMD in people with AMD.26 The authors included 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the United States, Europe, China, and Australia. Compared with placebo or no intervention, it was concluded that indi- viduals with ARMD may experience some delay in progression of the disease with the use of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementa- tion (alone or in combination). In addition to the AREDS research, several studies using various commercially available broad-based antioxidant formulas have shown promising results. For example, a 1.5-year study demonstrated that the

progression of dry ARMD could be halted (but not reversed) with a broad-spectrum 14-component antioxidant capsule (Ocuguard).27 A retrospective study of a nutritional supplement called ICAPS Plus (which contains beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, zinc, copper, man- ganese, selenium, and riboflavin) compared 38 patients who used the preparation regularly with 37 patients who used only one bottle and who served as controls.28 Of the treated patients, 15 showed improve- ment in their vision by one line or more on a vision acuity chart, compared with only 6 in the control group. In addition, 3 of the in the treatment group lost one line or more of vision, compared with 13 in the control group. In a second prospective blinded clinical trial reported in the same review, vision and contrast sensitivity were eval- uated. After 6 months, visual acuity was the same or better in 36 of controls compared with 168 of 192 treated patients. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, female health care professionals 40 years of age and older, with pre- existing cardiovascular disease or three or more cardiovascular disease risk factors, randomly received a combination of folic acid (2.5 mg/ day), pyridoxine hydrochloride (50 mg/day), and cyanocobalamin (1 mg/day) or placebo.29 After an average of 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, there were 55 cases of ARMD in the combination treatment group and 82 in the placebo group. For visually significant ARMD, there were 26 cases in the combination treatment group and 44 in the placebo group. These results indicate a 34% and 41% reduced relative risk, respectively.

## Xanthophylls (Lutein, Zeaxanthin)

Several studies have confirmed the benefit of supplementing the diet with xanthophylls (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin). A meta-analysis of RCTs involving 938 patients with ARMD and 826 healthy subjects revealed a dose–response relationship between supplementation with lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin and improved mac- ular pigment optical density (MPOD) both in patients with ARMD and healthy subjects.30 A 12-month double-blind study, the Lutein Antioxidant Supplementation Trial, sought to determine whether nutritional supplementation with lutein or lutein together with anti- oxidants, vitamins, and minerals improved visual function and symp- toms in atrophic ARMD.31 Patients receiving lutein (10 mg) alone or in combination with a broad-spectrum vitamin and mineral supplement showed improvements in mean eye macular pigment optical density, Snellen-equivalent visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. Patients who received the placebo, however, showed no significant changes in any of the measured findings. A prospective randomized interventional study evaluated if the addition of epilutein would augment MPOD in 40 patients with ARMD.32 Subjects were divided into two groups. Group 1 received daily oral administration of 8 mg epilutein in combination with mg lutein, whereas group 2 received 10 mg of lutein for 2 months. In patients with early-stage ARMD, the administration of lutein in com- bination with epilutein was associated with an increase MPOD com- pared with the administration of lutein alone. In a study using a comprehensive formula, 27 patients with non- advanced ARMD and visual acuity at or equal to 0.2 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution were enrolled and randomly divided into two age-similar groups.33 Fifteen patients added an oral supplement containing vitamin C (180 mg), vitamin E (30 mg), zinc (22.5 mg), copper (1 mg), lutein (10 mg), zeaxanthin (1 mg), and astaxanthin (4 mg) daily for 12 months, whereas 12 patients had no dietary supple- mentation during the same period. Based on multifocal electroretino- gram response-amplitude densities and visual acuity assessments, the results clearly indicate that early-stage ARMD can respond positively to supplementation with carotenoids and antioxidants. See Chapter 57 for more information on lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin.


Zinc plays an essential role in the metabolism of the retina, and the elderly are at high risk for zinc deficiency. In addition to the studies with a combination of nutrients, a 2-year prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 151 subjects with dry ARMD demonstrated that the group taking 200 mg/day of zinc sulfate (approximately 80 mg of elemental zinc) had significantly less visual loss than the placebo group.34 This initial report was one of the key prompts of the AREDS group to further evaluate whether antioxidant or zinc supplements delay age-related macular degeneration. In another study using a zinc-monocysteine (ZMC) supplement, subjects with ARMD were randomized to receive either ZMC 25 mg or placebo twice daily for 6 months.35 At the end of the study, the ZMC group showed improved visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Macular light-flash recovery time shortened in the ZMC group at 3 months by 2.1 to 3.6 s and at 6 months by 7.2 to 7.4 s. No improvement occurred in the placebo group. ZMC was well tolerated, with a gastrointestinal irritation rate of less than 2%. It should be noted that a double-blind study in 112 patients with wet ARMD failed to show any benefit with zinc supplementation.36

## Flavonoid-Rich Extracts

Flavonoid-rich extracts of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), Ginkgo biloba, or grape seed (Vitis vinifera) offer significant benefits in the pre- vention and treatment of ARMD. In addition to possessing excellent antioxidant activity, all three extracts have been shown to exert positive effects on retinal blood flow and function. Clinical studies in humans have demonstrated that all three are also capable of halting the pro- gressive visual loss of dry ARMD and possibly even improving visual function.37–40 Of the three extracts, bilberry extracts standardized to contain 25% anthocyanidins appear to be the most beneficial. Studies of animals with visible light-induced retinal degeneration demonstrate that bilberry anthocyanin extracts at appropriate dosages significantly inhibited retinal dysfunction; increased the levels of superoxide dis- mutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase; suppressed lipid perox- idation and proinflammatory cytokines; and attenuated the changes caused by light to certain apoptotic proteins.41 The anthocyanosides of V. myrtillus have a strong affinity for the retinal pigmented epi- thelium that constitutes the optical or functional portion of the ret- ina, reinforcing the collagen structures of the retina and preventing free-radical damage. Extracts of anthocyanins from blueberries inhibit the induction and progression of ARMD through antioxidant mech- anisms (e.g., decreasing levels of malondialdehyde and increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) as well as decreasing the levels of vascular-endothelial cell-growth fac- tor in human retinal epithelial cells.42 In addition, proanthocyanidins of Japanese horse chestnut seed shells (Aesculus turbinata) also inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis, resulting in a protective effect on the retina from diseases such as ARMD.43 Because the retinal pigmented epithelium is the portion of the eye affected in ARMD, anthocyano- sides appear to be ideal therapeutic agents for the disorder. G. biloba extract with a 24% ginkgo flavoglycoside content is per- haps a better choice if the patient is also showing signs of cerebrovascu- lar insufficiency, and grape seed extract may be the most useful in the patient with significant photophobia or poor night vision.

## Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with a decreased

## 1548SECTION 6 Diseases

risk of ARMD. Omega-3 PUFAs have structural, functional, and neu- roprotective roles and may favor the retinal accumulation of lutein and zeaxanthin and thus increase MPOD. A double-blind, placebo-con- trolled, prospective randomized clinical trial performed in 120 patients examined the associations of MPOD with plasma omega-3 PUFAs in subjects with a family history of ARMD.44 The subjects included in the study were aged 40 to 70, had at least one parent treated for ARMD, had no major eye conditions, and had no use of supplements contain- ing lutein or zeaxanthin the preceding year. After multivariate adjust- ment, high MPOD was significantly associated with higher plasma levels of omega-3 docosapentanoic acid. However, a Cochrane review found that omega-3 long-chain PUFA supplementation in people with ARMD for periods up to 5 years does not reduce the risk of progression to advanced ARMD or the development of moderate to severe visual loss.45


Although exercise may not play a role in reversing or directly prevent- ing ARMD, patients with visual impairment should consider strength and balance training to minimize the risk of falling.21


As with most diseases, prevention or treatment of ARMD at an early stage is most effective. The treatment of the wet form is laser photoco- agulation soon after diagnosis. Because free-radical damage and a lack of blood and oxygen supply to the macula appear to be the primary causes of macular degeneration, the consumption of antioxidant sup- plements and promotion of retinal blood flow are the keys to effective treatment. The use of nutritional supplementation in ARMD has under- gone extensive cost–benefit analysis. Compared with no therapy, antioxidant therapy yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,387 per quality-adjusted life-year (i.e., it lowered medical costs by $21,387 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) and lowered the percentage of patients with ARMD who developed visual impairment in the bet- ter-seeing eye from 7.0% to 5.6%.46


Foods to avoid in ARMD: • Fried and grilled foods and other sources of free radicals • Animal fat • Processed baked goods • Beer Foods to add to the diet of a patient with ARMD: • Yellow vegetables, green vegetables, tomato products (carotenes) • Flavonoid-rich berries (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, etc.) • Fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, and fish • Moderate wine consumption (advisable in those without contrain- dications to alcoholic beverages)


• Vitamin C: 500 to 1000 mg/day • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 200 to 400 IU/day • Selenium: 200 to 400 mcg/day • Folic acid: 800 mcg/day • Pyridoxine hydrochloride: 50 mg/day • Vitamin B 12 : 800 mcg/day • Lutein: 10 to 15 mg/day • Zeaxanthin: 1 to 2 mg/day • Astaxanthin: 4 to 6 mg/day


One of the following extracts may be selected: • G. biloba extract (24% ginkgo heterosides): 120 to 240 mg/day • V. myrtillus (bilberry) extract (25% anthocyanidin content): 120 to 240 mg/day • Grape seed extract (95% procyanidolic content): 150 to 300 mg/day


Balance training and strength exercises are recommended, especially for patients who are visually impaired.

# GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

The goals of an integrative medicine approach to menopause are to provide relief from common menopausal symptoms and to prevent and/or treat osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases of aging while minimizing the risks of breast cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), venous thromboembolism, strokes, and gallbladder disease. The evaluation process reveals a woman’s perimenopausal/ menopausal symptoms, other acute and chronic health problems, health habits, mental/emotional stressors, and risks for future diseases. One of the most complicated and difficult health care decisions that menopausal women face today is whether to use HT. Women look to their health care providers for definitive answers to these questions. Practitioners are faced with an even greater challenge: evaluating the benefits and risks of conventional hormone therapy (cHT) and natural hormone therapy (nHT) for an individual patient. In the year 2000, the peak of HT usage, some 46 million prescrip- tions for conjugated estrogen (Premarin) were written in the United States. An additional 22.3 million prescriptions were written for the same preparation with medroxyprogesterone (Prempro). Almost one in three women given a prescription for cHT never has it filled. Of those who do start cHT, the majority discontinue its use shortly after starting therapy. And after the initial results of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) were published, most women opted to discontinue or avoid starting HT—in 1999, 13.5% of women age 45 to 64 were taking HT (23.2% of 57-year-old women), but this declined dramat- ically to 2.7% in the year 2010.2 Reasons given for discontinuing the drug include uterine bleeding; side effects, including mood changes, breast tenderness, bloating, and weight gain; a fear of breast cancer; and not understanding or believing in the need for its long-term use. Lack of compliance can also be attributed to inadequate education of many healthcare practitioners regarding the needs of menopausal women, both gynecological and nongynecological. Many practitioners also have a limited understanding of the many therapeutic options for menopausal symptoms and of the more global issues of menopause. In addition, holistic menopause practitioners who use both cHT and nHT hold that compliance improves with the use of nHT and that many side effects disappear or improve when patients switch from cHT to nHT. Sadly, many menopausal women have a limited understanding of the long-term health risks associated with this change in hormone sta- tus, and very few women believe that they are well informed about the benefits and risks of cHT or nHT. Each woman wants to know whether HT is right for her—how she may benefit, how long she will have to take the drug to receive those benefits, and what the short-term side effects and potential long-term negative effects are. Scientific evidence regarding the use of postmenopausal HT comes in many shapes: observational studies, large-scale randomized trials, small clinical trials, biological plausibility, in vitro studies, and animal studies. Other factors involved in the hormone conundrum are the- oretical questions, areas of scientific uncertainty, popular consumer opinions and fears, and history. Definitive evidence for the benefits and risks of HT has been clarified by the two Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Studies (HERS I and HERS II), the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), and the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE). Another large-scale trial conducted in 14 countries, the Women’s International Study of Long Duration Oestrogen after Menopause (WISDOM), was discontinued in November 2004 for sci- entific and practical reasons. Because WISDOM was to be completed after the publication of WHI results, “there were no safety concerns for the 5700 women enrolled in the study. However, the trial was not expected to provide substantial evidence that would have an impact on clinical practice decisions in the next 10 years.”3 The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) has a very com- prehensive position statement, last updated in 2017.4,5 In summary, this document says that although there are many benefits (with regard to vasomotor symptoms, urogenital atrophy, urinary health, osteopo- rosis, and reduction in the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus), there are also slight statistical risks for some women (of stroke, venous thrombo- embolism, dementia, and coronary heart disease). What has emerged from this position statement, as well as others, is that the timing of HT initiation may be very important, the so-called “hormone-timing” or “timing” hypothesis. Specifically, younger women (those <59) may have a very favorable risk–benefit profile with HT use, including a potential reduction in mortality and cardiovascular risk, whereas women aged 60+ may see an increase in risk. Thus the NAMS current position concludes, “For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS (vasomotor symptoms) and for those at elevated risk of bone loss or fracture. Longer duration may be more favorable for ET (estrogen therapy) than for EPT (estrogen-progestogen therapy), based on the WHI RCTs.” Indeed, the ELITE trial found that oral estradiol ther- apy was associated with less progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (determined by carotid artery intima-media thickness) than placebo when initiated within 6 years after menopause, but not when initiated 10 or more years after.6 The bottom line is that women and their health care practitioners are faced with trying to make the best decisions possible on the basis of what we do know, what we do not know, and what we are still uncer- tain about.

## Symptoms

The decline of endogenous estrogen leads to multiple tissue and organ changes and problems. In addition to the reproductive and urinary tracts, estrogen-sensitive tissues include the skin, bone, vascular lining, the teeth and gums, the eyes, the brain, and the central nervous system. Some 50% to 80% of women in the United States report meno- pause-related hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, insomnia, mood swings, and depression. During the first 5 to 10 years of meno- pause, vulvovaginal symptoms begin to appear. Later, as the other mucous membranes of the urogenital tract become affected, rates of incontinence and infection rise. Vasomotor symptoms persisted an average of 7.4 years in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation and have subsequently been found to be associated with cardiovascu- lar, bone, and cognitive risks.7–9 There is strong evidence from randomized clinical trials that estro- gen therapy is very effective in controlling vasomotor and genitouri- nary symptoms. Vaginal estrogen is as efficacious as oral or transdermal estrogen for genitourinary symptoms and may be an advantageous method because of the local delivery and effect, and even at a low dose (e.g., 7.5 ug vaginal ring), it appears to be effective for managing symp- toms of vulvovaginal atrophy.10 Lower doses of HT (oral conjugated equine estrogens [CEE] 0.3 mg; oral 17b-estradiol ≤ 0.5 mg; or estradiol patch 0.025 mg) may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide symptom relief but may also lower the incidence of adverse effects, such as breast tender- ness or unscheduled vaginal bleeding.5 Sex steroids also affect sleep, libido, cognitive function, motor coordination, and pain sensitivity. Data are mixed regarding the role of menopause in depression and mood swings; however, depression and mood disorders appear to be more common or at least exacerbated in perimenopause or early menopause compared with the reproduc- tive period, and HT benefits many women. Although a 2017 system- atic review found no benefit of bioidentical hormone therapy for

## 1551CHAPTER 196 Menopause

menopausal-related depression, longer exposure to exogenous estro- gen does appear to have a protective effect, and it may be that estradiol (either as bioidentical or conventional) has an antidepressant effect in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal depressed women, although this is not clearly established.11–13 The NAMS and its advisory panel published a post-WHI report and recommendations on postmenopausal HT. One of its basic recom- mendations is that the treatment of menopausal symptoms (especially vasomotor and urogenital) remains the primary indication for HT or estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). The NAMS 2017 position paper also cites the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of HT for premature hypoestrogenism as well as for genitourinary symptoms.

## Osteoporosis

Estrogen is known to inhibit the age-related bone loss that occurs in most menopausal women, and both observational and controlled tri- als are in agreement about the benefit of HT for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Observational studies have indicated that the use of estrogen reduces the risk of vertebral fracture by approxi- mately 50% and the risk of hip fracture by 25% to 30%.14 A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2016 found that the overall relative risk of HT was 0.74 for total frac- tures, 0.72 for hip fractures, and 0.63 for vertebral fractures. Again, the benefit was more apparent among women younger than 60, and there was a greater decrease in fracture risk with estradiol compared with conjugated equine estrogens.15 Estrogen had been considered the ther- apeutic agent of choice for both the prevention and treatment of post- menopausal osteoporosis in women for many years—until the WHI results, which shifted the perception of benefit versus risk. Estrogen has been the most studied agent for prevention and has been shown to decrease bone resorption, prevent osteoporosis, and reduce fractures. Nevertheless, the FDA has removed estrogen from the list of agents approved as effective in treating women who already have osteopo- rosis (although in 2013 it approved Duavee, a combination of conju- gated estrogens with bazedoxifene, for use in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus for the prevention of osteoporosis and for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms).16 The deci- sion to remove estrogen from the approved list had nothing to do with any new discovery of a decrease in effectiveness for this indication; rather, it arose as an issue of fairness in new standards that have been applied to approving other drugs for osteoporosis treatment, such as the bisphosphonates (risedronate and alendronate). These agents have involved prospective fracture reduction studies on women with low bone mass and/or fracture and were not associated with the same per- ception of adverse effects demonstrated in the WHI.17 That being said, the WHI was a large clinical trial in which 16,608 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age were studied at 40 U.S. clinical centers.18 The regimen used was continuous combined estro- gen–progestogen therapy (CCEPT) (e.g., Prempro). Women in the CCEPT group experienced lower rates of hip fracture (10 per 10,000 person-years vs. 15 per 10,000 person-years in the placebo group, a 34% lower relative risk) and vertebral fracture (9 events per 10,000 women annually vs. 15 events per 10,000 women annually for placebo, also a 34% lower relative risk). Statistically significant fracture reduc- tions were also seen in other osteoporotic fractures (23%) and total fractures (24%). The different estrogen agents approved for the prevention of osteoporosis and their antiresorptive effects are as follows (with dose-dependent benefits): • Oral micronized estradiol, 1.0 mg/day • Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/day • Ethinyl estradiol, 5 mcg/day • Transdermal estradiol, 50 mcg/day • Esterified estrogen, 0.3 mg/day It is important to keep in mind that some women derive benefits from these doses, some will need higher doses, and others will have adequate bone protection with lower doses. Dual-energy x-ray absorp- tiometry (DEXA) scans provide the most reliable objective informa- tion on the status of bone mineral density.

## Colorectal Cancer

Accumulated observational studies suggested that the use of ERT reduced the risk for colorectal cancer as well as the risk of dying from colon cancer.19 Although not all study findings are consistent, some studies have shown that the risk of developing fatal colon cancer was reduced by 33%20; others show as little as an 8% reduction in risk.21 In the WHI intervention phase, women who received combined estrogen and progestin versus placebo were 38% less likely to develop colorectal cancer; however, further analysis of the WHI data, postintervention data, and analysis of the HERS trial found no strong evidence of a pro- tective effect of CEE alone or CEE and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on the risk of colorectal cancer.22

## Risks

<!-- chunk -->

## Endometrial Cancer

Unopposed estrogen administration is associated with an increase in the risk of endometrial cancer by a factor of 2.3, although this greatly increases to 9.5 among women using unopposed estrogen for more than 10 years, and the risk remains elevated at least 5 years after ces- sation of estrogen. Vaginal estrogen does not substantially lower this risk.23 This results in an excess of 46 cases per 10,000 women for women who use unopposed estrogen for at least 10 years.24 Adding a proved dose and delivery method of a progestogen (progestins or pro- gesterone), which opposes the effects of estrogen on the endometrium, reduces the risk to a minimum and is essential in preventing endome- trial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Support for the use of natural hormones, particularly oral micron- ized progesterone (OMP), came in the form of the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial and its study of the effects of HT on endometrial histology in postmenopausal women.25 This trial confirmed that daily CEE, 0.625 mg, enhanced the devel- opment of endometrial hyperplasia and that combining CEE with cyclic or continuous MPA protected the endometrium from hyper- plastic changes. What was new was that the trial also concluded that cyclic OMP (200 mg daily for 12 days per month) also protected the endometrium from the hyperplastic changes associated with estro- gen-only therapy. Thus the PEPI was the first clinical trial proving that OMP was as appropriate as MPA for use in the protection of the endometrium. Compounded OMP was already available, but the product Prometrium came on to the market as a result of that study. Unfortunately, data from the E3N (a large French cohort study) sug- gest that 100 mg OMP used continuously or 200 mg used sequentially may not be adequate; an overall hazard ratio of 1.80 for endometrial cancer was associated with its use (but other progesterone deriva- tives were not associated with an elevated risk). This increase in risk with OMP compared with other progesterone derivatives was also observed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (a cohort of over 115,000 postmenopausal women), which found an overall hazard ratio of 1.53 with OMP use, compared with 0.84 with other progesterone derivatives. Although other trials have not observed this increased risk with OMP, and a 2016 interna- tional panel of experts approved this dosing, this issue needs further evaluation.23,26–28

## Venous Thromboembolism

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an almost expected complication of the postmenopausal use of exogenous hormones. Observational studies have demonstrated that in postmenopausal women who use ERT, the risk of VTE is increased by a factor of 2 to 3.5. These obser- vations are consistent with the data found in HERS I (discussed later). The investigators reported that the risk of thromboembolic events was increased by a factor of 2.7 in the women receiving the estrogen- progestin therapy.20 HERS II showed that the relative risk (RR) of VTE increased 108% (RR 2.08), and the absolute risk was 0.59% in the HT group compared with 0.29% in the placebo group (59 events vs. events annually per 10,000 women, respectively).29 The WHI reported similar results. The relative risk was 2.11 in the HT group, a 111% increased risk. The absolute risk was 34 events in the HT group compared with 16 events in the placebo group per 10,000 women.20 Owing to the uncommon presence of idiopathic venous thromboembolism in women above 50 years of age, the absolute risk associated with postmenopausal HT is pretty small. For women who are already at risk for thromboembolism or who are older, the absolute risks of HT will be higher. For example, women in the CEE and MPA arm of the WHI aged 50 to 59 had a 2.27 relative risk for VTE, whereas it was 4.28 among those age 60 to 69 and 7.46 among women age 70 to 79.30 Although no randomized trials have confirmed it, observational studies and clinical findings strongly suggest that the increase in risk with oral ERT may be avoided with transdermal therapy, as found in the Estrogen Thromboembolism Risk (ESTHER) case-control study and two recent nested case-control studies.31,32

## Coronary Heart Disease

For the past 30 years, practitioners have been advising menopausal women that HT reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). More than 40 observational studies in the past three decades have suggested that this risk is 35% to 50% lower among women who take estrogen than in women who do not.33,34 These observational data have been reinforced by additional research demonstrating some of the impact of estrogen on individual factors known to be associated with CHD, thereby also establishing a biologically plausible mechanism for the association of HT and reduced CHD. Randomized trials have shown that estrogen ther- apy reduces plasma levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) by 10% to 14% and raises plasma levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 7% to 8%.20,35 Estrogen has also been shown to reduce Lp(a) lipoprotein, inhibit oxidation of LDL-C, improve endothe- lial vascular function, reduce fibrinogen, and reduce thickening in the arterial walls. However, estrogen may have detrimental effects on cardiovascular risk markers, such as by raising triglyceride levels, increasing clotting, and raising levels of C-reactive protein. These detrimental effects of estrogen may override the beneficial effects of estrogen on cardiovas- cular function and may explain the surprising results of randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicating that HT did not reduce the overall rate of CHD. In HERS II and the WHI, it actually increased the rate of CHD. These new data from randomized trials, compared with the years of observational data and the biologically plausible mechanisms, have rendered recommendations to postmenopausal women about HT more complex and challenging. Both patients and practitioners have questions with no clear-cut answers, and concerns about the ben- efits and risks of HT are more difficult to sort out. Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women, and an understanding of the current state of the evidence and the potential for the cardioprotective effects of HT, as well as the neg- ative cardiovascular effects of HT, is of vital importance to women’s health. In this discussion, however, one must not forget the potential cardioprotective effects of nutrition, exercise, stress management, and select nutrients such as niacin, magnesium, and fish oils. The basic problem with HT and CHD is that the later random- ized trials of estrogen among women with preexisting CHD have not confirmed the 40 observational studies of the last 30 years. The first large-scale randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of HT (a combination of CEEs [Premarin] and CEEs with medroxyproges- terone acetate [Provera]) for the secondary prevention of CHD was HERS I.20 In a total of 2763 women with established CHD studied at 20 clinical centers throughout the United States, the death rates from coronary causes and nonfatal myocardial infarctions in the hormone group and the placebo group were similar. Perhaps more worrisome was the 50% increase in the risk of CHD events (thromboembolism) during the first year in the women receiving HT. The HERS I data prompted a barrage of questions, as follows: • Are the HERS data simply wrong? • Does one clinical trial outweigh the vast array of observational studies? • Is the pattern of early risk real, and if so, what caused it? • Is the early risk related to some other factor present in a subgroup of women but not others? • Were the results related to the hormone regimen used? • Would the results be different with a natural estradiol and/or a nat- ural progesterone? • Did the MPA counteract the potential beneficial effects of estrogen? • Do these HERS I results for secondary prevention have implica- tions for questioning HT’s role in primary prevention? A brief attempt at some answers was made after HERS I: The early risk for increased CHD events in the hormone-treated group has been a pattern seen in subsequent studies—the Puget Sound Group Health Cooperative of Seattle,36 the Nurses’ Health Study,37 and the early data from WHI.38 An early risk for blood clots in the legs and lungs, heart attack, and stroke appears to be a real phenomenon in postmenopausal women who begin HT. Two hypotheses to explain this finding are that estrogen has a prothrombotic effect and a proinflammatory effect on the vascular endothelium. There indeed may be some subgroup of women with a predis- position for the prothrombotic and/or proinflammatory effects of estrogen—for example, women with hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, elevated homocysteine levels, increased C-reactive protein and Lp(a) lipoprotein levels, obesity, and/or elevated LDL-C. Interestingly, in the HERS I trial, differences were observed between hormone-treated women who also took lipid-lowering therapy (statins) and hormone- treated women who did not. The rate of CHD events after 1 year was much lower in the HT-plus-statin group than in those who did not use statins. The same was true for the risk of venous thromboembolic events. Another controlled trial attempted to address the question of whether estrogen inhibits atherosclerosis. In the placebo-controlled Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) trial, neither estro- gen alone nor estrogen plus the progestin39 affected the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Plasma levels of LDL-C were reduced by 9.4% in the unopposed estrogen group and by 16.5% in the estrogen- plus-MPA group. Both groups had significant increases in HDL-C (18.8% and 14.2%, respectively) compared with the placebo group. The two estrogen groups had a rise in triglyceride levels (6.1% and 10.1%, respectively), but these changes were not significantly different from the levels in the placebo group. The ERA trial provided the first anatomical end point (angiographically determined effects on coro- nary arteries) in women who had known CAD. The ERA trial sup- ported the overall null effect found by the HERS I trial and also showed that the MPA did not cancel out the beneficial effects of estrogen, as

was suspected in the HERS I trial. These data and other study results indicate that HT does not have a significant impact on the progression of atherosclerosis in women with established heart disease. Preliminary data from the Papworth Hormone-Replacement Therapy Atherosclerosis Study (PHASE), a small clinical trial in postmenopausal women with angiographically proved CAD, showed no cardiovascular benefits of HT and also possibly a slight increase in the rates of cardiovascular events during the first 2 years of HT.40 This trial evaluated transdermal natural estradiol alone or with norethin- drone, a different progestin. An interim analysis of the WHI data also suggested that there had been a slight increase in the number of heart attacks, strokes, and thromboembolic events during the first 1 or 2 years in postmenopausal women undergoing HT.41 One clinical trial looked at estrogen use in postmenopausal women without clinical coronary disease. The Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial (EPAT) was designed to determine whether unopposed natural estradiol reduces the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.42 Postmenopausal women with high cholesterol levels but no preexisting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or smoking history received either oral micronized natural estradiol or placebo and also lipid-lowering medication if serum LDL-C exceeded 160 mg/dL. The women were monitored for 2 years. The investigators evaluated the rate of change in carotid artery intimal-medial thickness. Women in the placebo group had an expected progression in the thickening of the carotid arteries over the 2 years. The women taking estradiol had a small amount of regression of the thickness of the carotid arteries. In women not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, the placebo group had a greater progression, and the estradiol group had no progression of intimal-medial thickness—a dramatic difference. Curiously, in the women who received lipid-lowering drugs, there was no difference in the rate of progression between the women receiving estrogen and those receiving placebo. On the basis of data from these randomized clinical trials con- ducted before HERS II and WHI, HT did not appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women who already had CHD. Then along came the world-shifting news in July 2002, when the results of HERS II and the WHI were published less than a week apart. HERS II investigated the effects of 0.625 mg of CEE plus 2.5 mg of MPA on the prevention of CHD in older U.S. women (average age years) with preexisting CHD.29 This study, a continuation of HERS I, was intended to determine whether a trend toward prevention of heart disease would appear if the study were continued longer. Once again, though, the results were not positive for women with heart disease. In HERS II there were no significant decreases in the rates of primary CHD events (or strokes or clots) among women assigned to the HT treat- ment group who had already had CHD before starting the HT regimen (RR, 1% decreased risk and absolute risk of 3.66% for HT vs. 3.68% for placebo). The investigators concluded that “postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy should not be used to reduce the risk of CHD events in women who already have CHD.”29 A few days later, the results of the landmark WHI study were pub- lished.18 The WHI investigated the effect of the most common HT reg- imen in the United States (0.625 mg Premarin plus 2.5 mg Provera, or Prempro) on the incidence of heart disease, breast and colorectal cancers, and fractures in postmenopausal women. The cardiovascular research was intended to investigate the effect of this HT regimen on the prevention of CHD in healthy postmenopausal U.S. women (aged 50–79 years) who do not have CHD. After a mean of 5.2 years of fol- low-up, the trial was stopped earlier than planned for the women using combined HT (mostly owing to harm from breast cancer incidence). In the WHI, there was a significantly higher risk of CHD annually per 10,000 women: a 29% increase in the relative risk and 37 more events in the HT group compared with 30 events in the placebo group. These findings, showing that estrogen plus progestin does not confer bene- fit in preventing CHD among women with a uterus, concurs with the HERS findings among women with clinical CHD as well as those of the ERA trial and others. The WHI results extend the findings of the earlier trials to include a wider range of women. More recent analyses also suggest that the “timing hypothesis” may play a central role in determining risk and currently is the best expla- nation for the relationship between cardiovascular risk and HT. As mentioned previously, initial data from the WHI suggested an increase in CHD risk, but the WHI was a somewhat older population (mean age 63). Women aged 50 to 59 in the WHI receiving CEE appear to have had a protective benefit on CHD, as well as a 30% statistically significant reduction in overall mortality.43 A 13-year follow-up of the WHI and a meta-analysis of trials (including the WHI) came to the same conclusion: When given to women near menopause, HT appears to have a cardioprotective effect, whereas it may increase the risk when given to women 60 years or older.44,45 This timing hypothesis was also supported by data from the ELITE trial, which found oral estradiol to be associated with less progression of coronary atherosclerosis (mea- sured by CIMT) when initiated within 6 years of menopause but not when given 10 years or more after menopause.6

## Stroke

In the WHI, there was no excess risk of stroke in the estrogen-plus- progestin group in the first year, but such a risk did appear in the second year, and it persisted.46 The mechanism does not seem to be related to an increase in blood pressure. The WHI findings were consistent but more dramatic than those of the HERS, which reported a nonsignifi- cant 23% increase in the treatment group.29 The WHI results were also more extreme than those of the Women’s Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST) of estradiol (without progestin) in women with a history of a prior stroke. Overall, the WEST trial found no effect of estrogen on recurrent strokes but some rise in rates in the first 6 months.47 Some might criticize the WHI statistics because they include older women. However, there was no indication that excess strokes were more likely to occur in older women, in women with prior stroke, through dif- ferences in race/ethnicity, or in women with high blood pressure. It is apparent that estrogen plus a progestin increases the risk of stroke in women who have been judged to be healthy. The estrogen-only arm of the WHI showed a slight increase in stroke for women in the youngest age group at study entry.48 The ERT arm was quite different from the HT arm. A 2015 Cochrane review of 19 randomized controlled trials found that although there was an increase in stroke risk with HT ther- apy, this appeared to be limited to women who started treatment 10 or more years after menopause.49 One of the most recent studies on estrogen leads us to the most provocative question: Do different kinds of estrogens have different effects? In this study, the risk of VTE was compared among those who used esterified estrogen, conjugated equine estrogen, and no estrogen at all.50 The findings concluded that CEE but not esterified estrogen was associated with venous thrombotic risk. Transdermal estrogen may also have an advantage on stroke risk compared with oral ET.51

## Gallstones

The risk of gallstones or cholecystectomy appears to be raised by a fac- tor of 2 to 3 in postmenopausal women who are taking ERT. This find- ing has been reported by several large observational studies. In HERS I, the women taking estrogen plus progestin were at a 38% higher risk of gallbladder disease than women who were taking a placebo.20 HERS II found similar results, reporting a higher incidence of biliary tract

surgery, with a 48% increased relative risk for those in the HT group and an absolute risk of 191 versus 129 events annually per 10,000 women.52 A 2017 Cochrane review that was heavily weighted by the WHI and HERS trials found that the absolute risk for gallbladder dis- ease after 5.6 years of HT use increased from 27 per 1000 with placebo to between 38 and 60 per 1000 with HT.53 It has been suggested by observational trials but not proven by randomized trials that transder- mal estrogen may help to reduce this increase in risk.54

## Areas of Uncertainty

<!-- chunk -->

## Breast cancer. For many women, fears about breast cancer and

a higher risk of breast cancer from HT dominate the decision-making process about menopause management. Clinicians must be educated about this topic and must be prepared to summarize the results of relevant research in order to counsel each woman about the benefits and risks in her particular situation. It is true that there are unanswered questions about the long-term safety of HT, especially regarding the risk of breast cancer. What is often forgotten is that the clinical trial data on ERT span the last years. No other pharmacological agent has been as thoroughly stud- ied as estrogen. A half-century of research preceded the early 1940s, when HT became commercially available. Even though patient fears are high and alternative practitioners are particularly suspicious and skeptical about its safety, no data clearly and consistently demonstrate a higher risk of breast cancer associated with HT. Nevertheless, many patients and practitioners continue to be certain that taking HT will cause breast cancer. Close to 60 observational studies of the association between HT and breast cancer have been published during the past 25 years, and no definitive answer exists because of inconsistency in the results of those studies. One analysis (before the WHI) of the evidence in those studies found that more than half of them reported either no difference in risk or a decrease in the risk of breast cancer with ERT/HT use.55 The remainder of the studies reported only slight rises in breast cancer risk. Another group of researchers attempted to reanalyze more than 90% of the published data on breast cancer and HT use.56 They reported that postmenopausal women who had ever used HT had a small but statistically significant increase in the risk for breast cancer compared with women who had never used HT. In women who were currently using HT or had recently used it, the relative risk rose by a factor of 1.02 to 1.04 for each year of use. After HT had been discontinued for 5 years, no significant excess risk remained. Also, breast cancers diag- nosed in women who had used HT tended to be less advanced and were more localized. Later reports from observational studies are also inconsistent. The report from the National Cancer Institute’s Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project was published in January 2000.57 These find- ings showed that the risk associated with recent HT use (both current use and use within the previous 4 years) was twice that associated with ERT. However, the relative risk for recent use of ERT was not statistically significant, and the difference between risks with ERT and HT was not tested for statistical significance. Right after that report was published, another group of investigators published and reported higher risk estimates for sequential HT regimens for 5 years or more of use than for continuous combined HT, although the difference was not statistically significant.58 In contrast to previous reports, this study found no difference in risk between current and past users. At the end of 2000, the Nurses’ Health Study published its estimates of breast cancer risk associated with HT in postmenopausal women.59 The results were expressed as percentage increases in the cumulative risk of breast cancer and were frightening to many: The use of estrogen alone for 10 years was found to lead to a 23% increase by age 70 years, and the use of estrogen plus progestin for 10 years was found to lead to a 67% increase by age 70 years. It is important for clinicians to realize (1) that the result is not an actual mathematical conclusion but the conclusion of the model—the consequences of a small difference in risk at the beginning that then is magnified as the math is carried out into the future—and (2) that risk estimates represent a projection, not an actual measurement. One of the most disturbing reviews was published in 1998. Colditz60 summarized the evidence that endogenous estrogen and ERT not only increase the risk but are causally related to breast cancer. In his review of hormones and breast cancer, he included reports on cell prolifera- tion and endogenous hormone levels as well as epidemiological studies of the relationship between the use of postmenopausal hormones and the risk of breast cancer. He found evidence of a causal relationship between female hormones and breast cancer based on consistency, dose–response pattern, biological plausibility, temporality, strength of association, and coherence. He stated that the magnitude of the increase in breast cancer risk per year of hormone use is comparable with that associated with delaying menopause by a year. The fact that women who menstruate longer have a higher risk of breast cancer also pro- vides support for a biological mechanism for the relationship between the use of exogenous hormones and increased risk. Colditz concluded that existing evidence supports a causal relationship between the use of estrogens and progestins, levels of endogenous estrogens, and breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women. The WHI was the first randomized controlled trial confirming that conjugated equine estrogens combined with progestins do increase the incidence of breast cancer and the first to quantify the increase. The 26% higher risk of breast cancer occurred after about 4 years and trans- lated to 8 more cases annually per 10,000 women.18 This is consistent with other epidemiological data. The study was discontinued primarily because of the breast cancer incidence, which crossed the monitoring boundary for safety. It is important to note that among women who received estrogen only (CEE) for a median of 5.9 years in the WHI, there was a decrease in invasive breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality over the median 11.8 years of follow-up.61 Unopposed estrogen was also found not to increase breast cancer risk in the Caroline Breast Cancer Study.62 Although estrogen should not be recommended as a preven- tative treatment for women without a uterus, they may be reassured regarding the effects of estrogen on breast cancer risk. At the other end of the pendulum, investigations that have found no increased risk of breast cancer with HT or ERT use receive much less attention. The Iowa Women’s Health Study is prospectively fol- lowing a cohort of women who were selected in 1985.63 After 6 years of monitoring, a statistically significant increase in the risk of breast cancer could not be detected in women who either had ever used or were currently using HT. Another report through 8 years of follow-up examined whether postmenopausal HT raised the risks for breast can- cer and death from cancer in women with a family history of breast cancer.64 There was no significant increase in the rate of breast cancer even in women who had a family history of breast cancer and had been using HT longer than 5 years. These results are consistent with those of other reports that there is no additional risk in using HT/ERT for women who have a first-degree relative with breast cancer. The latest analysis from the Iowa Women’s Health Study, an 11-year follow-up, showed an association between women who had ever used postmenopausal HT and the risk of breast cancers that were more localized and had a better prognosis.65 The researchers did not find an increased risk of invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma in women who had used HT for either less than or more than 5 years. A slight increase in risk was observed in current users and users for less than

## 1555CHAPTER 196 Menopause

5 years; current users with more than 5 years of use had no increase in risk. These results are the opposite of those seen in the Nurses’ Health Study—that women who use HT for more than 5 years have a higher risk.66 Two other studies, the Carolina Breast Cancer Study67 and analyses from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),68 found no increase in risk with postmenopausal hormones. These later studies perpetuate the inconsistency in research on this issue that has been seen in the last 25 years. This pattern pro- vides some logic to the point of view that if there is an increased risk of breast cancer associated with ERT/HT, the risk must be small, because by now, after so many years, we would have seen more consistency in the data, and the size of the risk estimates would be large rather than slight. It is to be hoped that, in consultations with patients, clinicians can offer a balanced view, reassuring them that no studies find an increased risk of breast cancer with the short-term use of HT and that the con- flicting, inconsistent results of more than 60 studies show that if there is an increased risk with long-term use, it is a small one. We can eval- uate the benefits and risks for each patient and make our recommen- dations on a short-term basis, which can help each individual to make decisions that are not necessarily permanent. Research in this area of medicine is prolific, and if we keep up to date on the latest findings, we can inform our patients so that they can make informed, timely choices about their health care.

## Cognitive function. Observational studies have suggested that

there is a relationship between endogenous estrogen exposure and cognition.69 A number of other observational reports have demonstrated that HT use may prevent or delay the onset or progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but additional observational results have been conflicting.70 A meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted in March of 2001 in which 29 studies were rated.71 In women who were symptomatic from menopause, postmenopausal use of estrogen improved verbal memory, vigilance, reasoning, and motor speed. There were no consistent effects on visual recall, working memory, complex attention, mental tracking, mental status, or verbal functions. Estrogen did not appear to enhance asymptomatic women’s performance consistently on formal cognitive testing. The meta-analysis did suggest that HT was associated with a lower risk of dementia, but the reviewers acknowledged that the studies analyzed had important methodology problems and that the information was inadequate to allow a proper assessment of the effects of various estrogen preparations or doses, progestin use, and duration of use. Studies in animals and the laboratory suggest plausible mechanisms for the potential of estrogen and the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Estrogen increases dendritic spine growth, axonal elongation, synapse formation, and neuronal survival. It also influ- ences several neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine; modulates nerve growth factor; increases apolipoprotein E; enhances blood flow; serves as an antioxidant; and enhances the uptake and metabolism of glucose. All of these effects could possibly inhibit the neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid and the damaging effects of free radicals, moderate the inflammatory events involved in plaque formation in the brain, enhance cerebral blood flow, and facilitate neuronal repair after brain injury. Results of randomized trials of ERT and Alzheimer’s disease and the potential of estrogen for the treatment of this disorder have not been impressive in terms of benefits. In one study, estrogen replace- ment for 1 year did not slow disease progression or improve global, cognitive, or functional outcomes in women with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.72 In another, participants at 10 of the 20 HERS centers were enrolled in the cognitive function substudy. The mean age of participants at the time of cognitive function testing was 71 ± years. Among these older women with coronary artery disease (CAD), 4 years of treatment with conjugated equine estrogens plus progestins did not result in better cognitive function as measured on six different standardized tests.73 In a later prospective study of dementia, prior use of HT was asso- ciated with reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, but the duration of use very specifically affected the benefit; there was no apparent ben- efit from the current use of HT unless the use exceeded 10 years.74 More recent data suggest that the “timing hypothesis” may be relevant to cognitive function as well. For example, a 2017 Cochrane review found that women over 65 taking continuous combined HT showed an increase in the incidence of dementia (from 9 per 1000 to 11–30 per 1000).53 However, the results from a subset of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) data suggest no effect on cogni- tive function among recently postmenopausal women.75 The timing hypothesis was not confirmed in a trial looking for just this effect, how- ever. In a randomized trial with a duration of 57 months, no effect on cognitive function was observed, and no difference was observed when HT was initiated within 6 years of menopause or after 10+ years postmenopause.76

## Ovarian cancer. Evidence concerning a possible positive

association between HT use and ovarian cancer risk is less consistent and of lesser significance than that for endometrial and breast cancers. Most of the data show a weak positive association. A large prospective cohort (observational) U.S. study of 211,581 postmenopausal women treated for longer than 10 years with conventional HT found an association with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.77 No distinction was made regarding the type or regimen of HT or whether a progestogen was added to the ERT. Participants had no history of cancer, hysterectomy, or ovarian surgery. The study, monitoring women from 1982 to 1996, showed that women who were using HT at study entry had higher death rates from ovarian cancer than women who had never used HT. The risk was slightly but not significantly higher among former estrogen users. Women who used HT at baseline and for 10 years or more had a relative risk of 2.20, and former users with at least 10 years of use had a relative risk of 1.59. The annual age- adjusted cancer death rates from ovarian cancer per 100,000 women were 64.4 for baseline HT users with 10 or more years of use, 38.3 for former users with 10 or more years of use, and 26.4 for women who had never used HT. In this observational study, as in the Nurses’ Health Study, the lack of information is almost more disturbing than the actual information. We have no data as to the type, dose, or combination of estrogen and progestogen used by the participants. As a result, many assumptions were made that influenced data analysis and the effect on relative risk. We know that the way in which hormones have been prescribed has changed from 1982 through 1996 and since then. In the early 1980s, most women were prescribed unopposed daily estrogen. During the 1980s, sequential estrogen plus progestogen therapy was introduced to eliminate the increased risk of endometrial cancer. Most women began to take 7 to 10 days of progestogen per month along with their estro- gen. In the 1990s, common prescribing habits involved continuous and combined estrogen/progestogen regimens and lower doses of both hormones. Whether sequential or cyclic, progestogen is generally pre- scribed for at least 12 days per month. The number of different estro- gens and progestogens has also significantly expanded and changed since the early 1980s and even in the last few years. The investigators also reported on relative risk. Given the low inci- dence of ovarian cancer, even if there is a significant increase in relative risk, it may not have much of an impact on absolute risk. Although this study shows a doubling of the relative risk, the incidence of ovarian cancer mortality in postmenopausal women is extremely low, at 1.6%.

## 1556SECTION 6 Diseases

It is also interesting to remember that 7 years or more of oral contra- ceptive use in reproductive-age women actually lowers the incidence of ovarian cancer. A large, prospective study reported a significant twofold-higher risk of ovarian cancer among long-term users of HT and ERT.78 A total of 44,241 postmenopausal women were selected from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP); 329 women who experi- enced ovarian cancer were identified. Women who used estrogen-only replacement therapy, especially for more than 10 years, were at signifi- cantly higher risk of ovarian cancer, with a relative risk of 1.8; women who used estrogen only for 20 or more years had a relative risk of 3.2. The good news was that women who used short-term combination replacement therapy were not at increased risk. In 2015 a meta-analysis of 52 epidemiological studies was published in the Lancet. An increase in risk was observed even among women using HT for less than 5 years, as well as among those taking estrogen only or estrogen and a progestogen. The absolute risk for women tak- ing HT for about 5 years and starting around age 50 was 1 additional case per 1000 users and one additional ovarian cancer death per users.79

## Focus on estrogen only. The WHI originally had three

components: HT, a low-fat dietary modification, and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D. In addition, many of the women who did not qualify for the active treatments of the WHI became part of an observational group that was studied. Both arms of the placebo- controlled HT component (estrogen plus progestin [HT] and estrogen only [ERT]) were terminated before the planned ending date. The ERT arm of the WHI was halted on March 1, 2004, after 6.8 years of follow-up and less than a year before the planned closing date.48 The ERT arm was quite different from the HT arm in that the risks in the ERT arm did not exceed the benefits. The study showed a slightly increased risk of stroke, a decreased risk of hip fracture, a lack of increase in the risk of breast cancer, and a possible reduction in breast cancer risk and no effect on the incidence of CHD. The key clinically relevant issues from the WHI ERT study are as follows: • CHD was reduced by almost half in the youngest age group (the most common age group of women who initiate ERT). • The risk of stroke increased only slightly for women in the youngest study-entrance age group. • The risk of VTE was increased in all three age groups, but the degree of risk increased with age at study entry. • The risk of invasive breast cancer was reduced in all three age groups. • The risk of colorectal cancer was decreased in the two younger groups, especially in women aged 50 to 59; it was increased in women aged 70 and older. • The overall reduction in risk of fracture was most evident in younger women. • ERT was associated with a lower death rate in the group that was the youngest at study entrance. • The middle age group had about the same death rate in both the ERT and placebo groups, and there was a slightly higher death rate in the oldest age group. What the WHI ERT study basically showed is that ERT, using CEE, is safe for most menopausal women who do not have a uterus. ERT reduced the risk of CHD in those women who started ERT near the age of menopause; it decreased the risk of fractures; it did not increase the risk of breast cancer; the risk of colorectal cancer was increased in women who started therapy at age 70 or older; and it was associated with a slight increase in the risk of stroke and VTE, but there was no increase in death rates. It would appear that the use of ERT alone by women without a uterus is safer than using estrogen plus a progestin.

## Natural hormones. It is important to understand that most of the

research on hormone regimens is on CEEs and MPA. However, that is not exclusively the case, and certainly some of the cardiovascular research has equally implicated 17-beta-estradiol (bioidentical estradiol). Nonetheless, in the most damaging data to date, from HERS I and II and the WHI, the hormones used were the equine estrogens and progestin. So, what we definitely know to be negative effects are associated with those regimens, and we do not, in fact, know whether the data can be applied to other regimens. It would be naive to dismiss the data and not to admit the possibility that the results would be the same. When hormones are determined to be appropriate or even necessary, however, it would at the very least seem logical to use the hormones we know not to be those with adverse effects. Natural compounded estrogens and natural compounded proges- terone, as well as natural testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), such as those used by compounding natural pharmacies and the natural progesterone creams sold over the counter, are distinct and different in several critical ways from CEEs, conjugated plant estro- gens, synthetic estrogens, and synthetic progestins. Natural hormones are made from either beta-sitosterol extracted from the soybean or from diosgenin extracted from Mexican wild yam root. Those com- pounds are then made into the desired hormone and are biochemically identical to the hormone the body produces. By definition, a natural hormone is plant derived and bioidentical. The natural compounded estrogens are either estriol, estrone, or estradiol. Estriol is particularly unique because it has approximately one-fourth the potency of estra- diol and estrone. Natural compounded estrogens are generally used in lower doses owing to the combined effect of the weaker estriol along with the estradiol and/or estrone. These natural estrogens are thought to be metabolized significantly differently by the body, have shorter half-lives, can be used in customized dosing regimens and potencies to fit each individual woman and clinical situation, and can be adjusted to be stronger or weaker in small units to taper someone off or onto hormones. There is another distinction worth making; hormones may be bioidentical, that is, have the same molecular structure as endogenously produced hormones, and manufactured in standardized dosages by drug companies, for example, Vivelle (estradiol) and Prometrium (micronized progesterone). These are distinct from compounded bioidentical hormones, which also optimize dosages, currently do not have FDA approval, and are discouraged by most conventional organizations.80 CEEs, those that were used in the WHI study, are quite different. In the 1970s it was believed that Premarin consisted only of 10 estrogens: 17- β -estradiol, 17- β -dihydroequilin, 17- β -dihydroequilenin, 17- α - dihydroequilin, 17- α -estradiol, estrone, equilin, 17- α -dihydroequilenin, Δ -8-9-dehydroestrone sulfate, and equilenin. Since then, advance- ments in technology have shown that the original 10 estrogens make up less than 40% of the hormonal content of Premarin. Through the use of modern analytic techniques, more than 200 individual com- ponents have been identified, including androgens and progestins.81 The composition of Premarin is complex, and different estrogens have various effects in different tissues. Herein may lie an explanation for problems with conjugated equine estrogens versus natural bioidentical estradiol, estrone, and estriol. The steroid hormones, including the sex steroids produced by the ovaries, represent a subclass of lipids that share a four-ring steroid structure. The native compound from which all the sex steroids are derived is cholestane, the parent of cholesterol. When nutritional states of the individual and cell are normal, the principal precursor of steroid

production is cholesterol in the plasma. The cholesterol enters the cells through a lipoprotein receptor system. The activity of the enzymes within the cells of that tissue determines the particular classes of ste- roids produced. Steroids, either endogenous or exogenous, enter the cells via passive diffusion. The tissues responsive to steroids have very specific intracellular receptors, each with a high affinity for its particu- lar steroid. The primary action of the steroids is the binding of a steroid hormone to a receptor and the interactions of this receptor-hormone complex with the components of the cell. When the steroid binds, the steroid-receptor complex becomes activated and binds with very spe- cific regions within the steroid-responsive regions of the genes. Most of the effects of steroids on responsive cells are mediated through the acti- vation of very specific genes. The hypothesis is that a nonbioidentical hormone may act like a constant and indiscriminant environmental toxin to the genetic material within the cell because, even though it can bind to the receptor-hormone complex, it is a foreign substance. Consider CEEs, which consist of more than 200 substances mostly foreign to a human. These substances, once ingested, are a part of that complex and therefore are activating those genes within the cell. Thus there is a profound distinction between a hormone that is bioiden- tical to human hormones and one that is not. Besides the effect on the genes themselves, bioidentical hormones and nonbioidentical hor- mones may very well leave different metabolic footprints on the rest of the body, with different metabolic consequences. They may be directly cytotoxic to estrogen-sensitive tissues, alter binding of other hormones to those receptors, or change the liver’s metabolism of carcinogens. It is because of this distinction and the potential difference in metabolic consequences—as well as the shorter half-life of natural hormones— that naturopathic physicians prefer bioidentical natural hormones almost exclusively for the treatment of symptomatic menopause when hormones are required. The distinctions between synthetic progestins and progesterone are even clearer. Natural progesterone has been studied and shown to have less adverse effects on the cardiovascular system than synthetic pro- gestins such as MPA. Specifically, natural progesterone lowers HDL-C significantly less than MPA, is less atherogenic, and does not cause cor- onary artery spasm, whereas MPA does. Natural estradiol may not be without concerns about its effects on the cardiovascular system and breast. However, it is typically used in a half-strength dose (0.5 mg total daily) because it is combined with the significantly weaker estriol. Estriol has been shown to have some ability to act as an antiestrogen in the breast and no significant effect on the cardiovascular system. Further consideration of a natural hormone approach and a more holistic approach to menopause would lead one to use the hormones in combination with other strategies known to reduce the risk of breast cancer and heart disease. For example, soy, flaxseeds, cabbage fam- ily foods, and supplements can promote the metabolism of estrogens to their anticarcinogenic breakdown products. Diets designed to help prevent breast cancer and heart disease can also be emphasized, along with nutritional and botanical supplements to be considered, such as vitamins E and C, the carotenes, soy, coenzyme Q 10 , green tea, and garlic. Women who are using CEE and MPA should consider other nat- ural estrogen and natural progesterone regimens or nonhormonal menopause management. Women who are using natural estrogens and natural progesterone should consider a reevaluation of the hor- mone regimen to establish the lowest dose for achieving the bene- fits and minimizing the risks. Regular, at least annual, consideration should be given to the duration of use on an individual basis. Women who do not have a uterus and are being treated with any hormone reg- imen should take estrogen alone. Neither synthetic MPA nor natural progesterone is needed. Additional herbal and nutritional supplements may be considered as well. Studies on black cohosh, red clover, soy, maca, bioflavonoids, and kava have all shown proved scientific efficacy in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The majority of women require only these nonhormonal supplements for symptom relief and never need any kind of HT. Other women may be able to lower their dose of cHT or natural hormones by using them in combination with the herbal and nutritional supplements. Guidelines on the use of the different forms of HT are given follow- ing the discussion of nonhormonal approaches.

## The Major Symptoms of Menopause

Common complaints of perimenopause and menopause are as follows: • Irregular bleeding (in perimenopause) • Hot flashes (or night sweats) • Vulvovaginal thinning, dryness, dyspareunia, and burning (known as atrophic changes) • Bladder frequency/urgency/leakage • Mood changes • Cognitive changes • Body aches • Sleep disturbances Other symptoms can include fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hair thin- ning, the appearance of facial hair, headaches, voice impairment, dry skin, and joint pains.

# TREATMENT OVERVIEW

The goal of a natural and integrative approach to menopause is to rec- ognize that there are many options for symptom management, disease prevention, and disease treatment. One might categorize these in the following way: 1. Diet, exercise, and stress management 2. Nutritional supplementation 3. Botanical medicines 4. Compounded bioidentical HT (cbHT) 5. Bioidentical HT (bHT) (FDA-approved prescription items) 6. Nonbioidentical HT (HT) (FDA-approved prescription items) 7. Condition-specific nonestrogen pharmaceuticals (for either symp- tom relief or disease prevention/treatment) There are three fundamental goals in treatment: relief of symptoms, prevention of disease, and treatment of disease. Each woman is assessed individually to determine the scope and severity of her symptoms and is evaluated subjectively and objectively as to her risks of osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer as well as other chronic health problems. Diet, exercise, lifestyle, and/or nutritional supplements and botan- ical therapies will be effective for the management of menopausal symptoms in the majority of women. When these are not adequate, HT or other medications can be recommended.

## Nutrition

Nutrition plays a fundamental role in integrative medicine. Although dietary advice should be individualized, common themes include a diet rich in whole, “natural,” and unprocessed foods, with an emphasis on vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds, nuts, fruits, lean low-fat pro- teins, and healthy fats, such as olive oil; to be minimized are saturated fats and fried foods, simple carbohydrates, alcohol, sugar, and salt. For example, a systematic review of the Mediterranean diet has shown it to be associated with lower cancer mortality, including a reduction in

breast cancer incidence.82 This is supported by the results from a ran- domized, single-blind controlled Spanish trial that enrolled over women aged 60 to 80, who were advised to reduce fat intake (con- trol) and follow a Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil or a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts. They observed a 68% reduction in breast cancer with the diet plus olive oil group and a 41% reduction in the diet plus nuts group.83 Similarly, a Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with vasomotor menopausal symptoms in a prospective cohort study following over 6000 Australian women.84 Some specific foods, such as soy and flax, have been studied for their beneficial effects on menopause-related symptoms.

## Soy. Soy foods may be useful in menopause primarily for their

potential benefits in moderating hot flashes, slowing bone loss, improving the lipid profile and blood pressure, and lowering the risk for CAD. There are conflicting studies on soy for hot flashes, some showing effect and others not, making it difficult to draw any definitive conclusion. Two systematic reviews of isoflavones (from soy and red clover [Trifolium pratense]) and menopausal symptoms and the consensus opinion from the North American Menopause Society offer a good summary of the research.85 The first systematic review evaluated the literature of randomized controlled clinical trials on soy and perimenopausal symptoms.85 Only 4 out of 10 trials showed benefit. In the second systematic review, 25 trials of soy and red clover isoflavones involving approximately 2300 women met the study criteria, the results were mainly positive but not consistent.86 A consensus opinion of the NAMS85–87 reports many diverse areas of the impact of soy. The evidence for isoflavones and hot flashes showed mixed results, but they appear to be modestly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms; supplements that provide higher amounts of genistein or an increase in S-equol may be more benefi- cial. In addition, the NAMS concludes that soy food consumption is associated with a lower risk of breast and endometrial cancer in obser- vational studies. The NAMS also reports its opinion that the efficacy of soy on bone health has yet to be adequately proved. Cardiovascular benefits are still evolving, but the effect of soy does appear to lessen the arterial stiffness, yet the evidence is mixed on the lipid values in postmenopausal women. Preliminary evidence of the cognitive benefit from soy isoflavones seems to point in the direction that younger post- menopausal women derive more benefit within the first few years of menopause rather than older postmenopausal women. Another study has shed some light on why the research on soy isoflavones and vaso- motor symptoms is so contradictory. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comprising 96 menopausal women was conducted over 6 months.88 In this study, 66 women were given 135 mg of soy isoflavones, and 30 women were given a placebo. After 1 week, the women in the treatment group were tested and further divided into two subgroups, equol-producing (EP) and non–equol-producing (non-EP), accord- ing to peak levels of equol in their urine. The women in both of these subgroups were then given 3 g of soy germ extract powder twice a day, totaling 135 mg of isoflavones daily, for 6 months. Menopausal symptoms were evaluated using a modified Kupperman Index measur- ing 17 items (hot flashes, excessive sweating, coldness of the extrem- ities, shortness of breath, numbness of the extremities, paresthesias of extremities, insomnia, easy awakening, excitability, nervousness, melancholia, vertigo, weakness, arthralgia or myalgia, headaches, pal- pitations, and formication). Symptoms were scored as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Compared with the placebo group, symptoms of hot flashes and excessive sweating were significantly reduced after months, and weakness, palpitations, limb paresthesias, and total symp- toms significantly decreased after 6 months (P < 0.05), but only in the EP group. At 3 months, total scores had decreased by 66% in the EP group, 54% in the non-EP group, and 59% in the placebo group. At 6 months, symptom scores had decreased by 84% in the EP group, 58% in the non-EP group, and 66% in the placebo group. Studies that may have had a higher percentage of women who were equol produc- ers have been previously suspected to be the determining factor in the effectiveness of soy isoflavones, but the current study seems to be the first to demonstrate more clearly that a woman’s ability to produce equol determines her response to soy isoflavone supplementation. Daidzein and genistein are the two most significant phytoestrogens in soy. Daidzein is converted to equol, a metabolite of daidzein, by bac- terial flora in the gut. For clinicians, part of the task in treating meno- pausal women with soy may be to test for equol production before treatment and/or improve their gut flora so that they can more easily transform soy isoflavones to equol. In 2015 a model-based meta-analysis of 16 studies was published that found a maximal percentage decrease in menopausal hot flashes of 25.2% (after eliminating placebo effect), which accounted for 57% of the maximal effect of estradiol. Additionally, the study found that to achieve 50% of soy’s maximum effect, a 13-week period is needed, much longer than estradiol’s 3-week period for 50% effect. This may also partly explain the lack of effect observed in some short-term studies.89 In reviewing traditional Asian diets, the average adult daily intake of soy isoflavones is somewhere between 50 and 150 mg per day. The isoflavone content of soy foods varies with the form (Table 196.1).

## Flaxseed. Another significant dietary source of phytoestrogens

is flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum). Flaxseed contains the lignans matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, which are known to have estrogenic activity, as well as other lignans that are modified by intestinal bacteria to form estrogenic compounds. Lignans are absorbed in the circulation and have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity.90 Only a small amount of research has been done in the area of flaxseed and hot flashes. One small but encouraging study, in 2007, showed that women who consumed 2 tbsp of flaxseed twice daily halved their number of hot flashes within 6 weeks and reduced the intensity of their hot flashes by 57%.91 A 2014 systematic review also

found flax consumption to be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer as well as a possible reduction in mortality risk among women with breast cancer.92


The benefits of exercise for peri- and postmenopausal women are numerous (Box 196.1). Women can achieve substantial reductions in cardiovascular disease93 and breast cancer risk,94 increases in bone density,95 and reductions in body fat and body mass index while also experiencing an improved sense of well-being.96 However, whether exercise can reduce hot flashes during meno- pause is not clear. Moderate exercise may be beneficial for hot flashes; more vigorous exercise may actually exacerbate them.

## Toxin Avoidance

Often overlooked is the impact of environmental pollutants on menopause and related conditions, yet it should be self-evident that endocrine-disrupting chemicals would affect hormonal activity. For example, Fig. 196.1 highlights the toxins likely to affect female repro- ductive pathways.

<!-- chunk -->

## Endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In an analysis of NHANES

data, at least 15 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were found to be associated with earlier menopause, with women with higher serum levels reaching menopause roughly 2 to 4 years earlier than women with lower levels. Additionally, women exposed to EDCs were up to 6 times more likely to be menopausal than nonexposed women. The list of EDCs associated with earlier menopause included nine polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), three pesticides, a furan, and two phthalates.97

<!-- chunk -->

## Polychlorinated biphenyls. Some PCB compounds, such as

PCB138, have also been associated with an increase of over threefold in the risk for breast cancer among women with the highest levels.98

<!-- chunk -->

## Phthalates and bisphenol A. Another recent review found that

EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A, were likely causes of premature ovarian insufficiency.99 Phthalates specifically have been Fig. 196.1 Environmental toxins likely to affect female reproductive health.

linked to vasomotor symptoms; women with the highest urinary levels of phthalate metabolites (from personal care products) were about 45% more likely to have ever experienced hot flashes, to have had hot flashes in the past 30 days, and to have more frequent hot flashes.100

<!-- chunk -->

## Lead. Data from NHANES have also shown that lead body

burden, assessed via blood lead levels, was also associated with earlier menopause, with an increased likelihood of over fourfold for being menopausal among women with the highest lead exposure.101 A complete treatment plan must include education about the role of these toxins in menopausal status and symptoms, as well as clear advice for reducing relevant exposure (e.g., avoiding personal care products with phthalates, etc.).

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress Management

Perimenopause/menopause can be a stressful time in a woman’s life. Surprisingly, studies of women in midlife suggest that depression, as defined by the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), is no more common during menopause than at any other time of life.102,103 Most studies indicate that the per- imenopausal transition is associated with depressive symptoms and that women experience mood changes but fail to meet the DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of depression.104–106 A woman’s ability to manage stress can be enhanced with self-care tools that may include meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, being out in nature, and getting regular exercise.

## Dietary Supplements

There are a number of nutritional supplements that may be beneficial for hot flashes and night sweats. Most women should probably take a good multivitamin—one that provides 70% to 100% of the recom- mended daily allowances of vitamins and minerals. In addition, there are numerous supplements for other individual symptoms commonly experienced during menopause, such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety. These supplements include melatonin, l-tryptophan, and 5-HTP for insomnia; vitamins B 6 and B 12 , folic acid, and l-tyrosine for depression; and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and l-theanine for anxiety.

## Hesperidin, Vitamin C, and Procyanidolic Oligomers

Combined with vitamin C, hesperidin and other citrus flavonoids may be effective in relieving hot flashes. In one clinical study, 94 women suffering from hot flashes were given a formula containing 900 mg of hesperidin, 300 mg of hesperidin methyl chalcone (another citrus fla- vonoid), and 1200 mg of vitamin C daily.107 At the end of 1 month, symptoms of hot flashes were relieved in 53% of the patients and reduced in 34%. Improvements in nocturnal leg cramps, nosebleeds, and easy bruising were also noted. The only side effect was a slightly offensive body odor with a tendency for the perspiration to discolor the clothing. Dietary vitamin C has also been positively associated with bone mineral density among postmenopausal women.108 Perhaps more useful than hesperidin are preparations contain- ing procyanidolic oligomers (PCOs); see Chapter 209. In a double- blind study, a group of perimenopausal Taiwanese women 45 to 55 years of age were given either placebo or 100 mg of PCOs (as Pycnogenol) twice daily for 6 months.109 Of the total, 155 women received the Pycnogenol, and 75 women received the placebo. The 36-item Women’s Health Questionnaire was used to evaluate the climacteric symptoms at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Blood pressure decreased similarly in both groups. HDL-C increased and LDL-C decreased significantly from baseline with Pycnogenol, but no significant differences were seen in HDL-C between the two groups. However, LDL-C was more significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group. Perimenopausal symptoms of depression, vasomotor symp- toms, memory, anxiety, sexual function, and sleep all improved sig- nificantly (P <0.001) in both severity and frequency with Pycnogenol as soon as 1 month after starting the treatment. Most symptoms also improved with placebo but not significantly. In two more recent small trials, Pycnogenol supplementation was also found to reduce common symptoms of menopause (including hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, etc.), as well as cardiovascular risk factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and homocysteine.110,111

## Gamma-Oryzanol

Gamma-oryzanol (ferulic acid) is a growth-promoting substance found in grains and isolated from rice bran oil. In the treatment of hot flashes, its primary action is to enhance pituitary function and pro- mote endorphin release by the hypothalamus. Gamma-oryzanol was first shown to be effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, in the early 1960s.112 Subsequent studies have further documented its effectiveness.113 In one of the earlier studies, 8 menopausal women and 13 women whose ovaries had been surgically removed were given 300 mg/day of gamma-oryzanol. At the end of the 38-day trial, more than 67% of the women had a 50% or greater reduction in menopausal symptoms.112 In a later study, the benefit of a 300-mg/day dose of gamma-oryzanol was even more effective, in that 85% of the subjects reported improve- ment in their menopausal symptoms.113 Gamma-oryzanol is an extremely safe natural substance. No sig- nificant side effects have been produced in experimental and clinical studies. In addition to being helpful in improving the symptoms of menopause, gamma-oryzanol has also been shown to be quite effective in lowering blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.114

## Fish Oils

A study on fish oil supplementation and hot flashes has afforded cli- nicians with another option in treating hot flashes and night sweats. Women in this study were between 40 and 55 years of age and had moderate to severe psychological distress, defined as a score of 72 or greater on the Psychological General Well-Being Schedule. Only women with hot flashes were included in the current analysis.115 In total, women were randomly assigned to an ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) plus omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or placebo for weeks. The E-EPA supplementation was a 500-mg capsule taken three times daily, with each capsule containing 350 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 50 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The baseline level of hot flashes was an average of 2.8 per day. After 8 weeks, the fre- quency of hot flashes decreased by a mean of 1.58 per day in the E-EPA group and by only 0.50 per day in the placebo group. There was a sig- nificant reduction of 55% in the frequency of hot flashes in the E-EPA group compared with only a 25% decrease in the placebo group. There was also a greater responder rate in the E-EPA group of 58.5%, versus 34.4% in the placebo group. However, there were no differences in the severity of hot flashes or in quality-of-life scores between the two groups. In another fish oil–hot flash study, 20 perimenopausal or post- menopausal women received 8 weeks of fish oil (840 mg EPA and 375 mg DHA). Hot flashes were monitored using diaries and the hot flash–related daily interference scale. The response rate was 70% (a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score decrease of 50% or more; the remission rate was 45%). Responders had significantly lower pretreatment DHA levels than nonresponders did, with a pretreatment score of 4.3 and posttreatment score of 1.8 for daytime hot flashes and a pretreatment score of 4.6 and posttreatment score of 0.7 for night-time hot flashes.116

## 1561CHAPTER 196 Menopause

A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis found that although fish oil may reduce the severity and frequency of night sweats, no other benefit on vasomotor symptoms was observed. The lack of controlled trials, however, prevents any firm conclusions.117


In the late 1940s, several clinical studies found vitamin E to be effective compared with placebo in relieving hot flashes and menopausal vagi- nal complaints.118,119 Unfortunately there have been no further clinical investigations, aside from one small randomized trial in 2007, which found reductions in both hot flash severity and frequency.120 In one of the earlier studies, vitamin E supplementation was shown to improve not only the symptoms but also the blood supply to the vaginal wall when taken for at least 4 weeks.118 A follow-up study published in demonstrated that vitamin E (400 IU/day) was effective in about 50% of postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis.119 Vitamin E oil, creams, ointments, or suppositories can be used top- ically to provide symptomatic relief of atrophic vaginitis. Vitamin E may be effective in relieving the dryness and irritation of atrophic vag- initis as well as other forms of vaginitis.107


Many plants have been shown to exert a tonic effect on the female glandular system. As a class, these botanicals are often referred to as “uterine tonics.” Much of their effect is thought to result from phy- toestrogens in the plants as well as the plants’ ability to improve blood flow to the female organs. Some of the botanicals used in menopausal women work to nourish and tone the female glandular and organ sys- tem rather than exerting a druglike effect. This nonspecific mode of action makes many botanicals useful in a broad range of female con- ditions. Other plants are used for specific symptoms, such as valerian for insomnia or chaste tree for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Their mechanisms of action do have pharmaceutical effects, whether it be a sedative effect in the case of valerian or increasing luteinizing hor- mone and an indirect progesterone-like effect in the case of chaste tree. Mechanisms of action of other botanicals have so far eluded us. Phytoestrogens are found in many medicinal herbs with a historical use in conditions that are now treated by estrogens. Phytoestrogen- containing herbs offer significant advantages over the use of estrogens in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Although both synthetic and natural estrogens may pose significant health risks, phytoestrogens have not been associated with these side effects. In fact, epidemiolog- ical data and experimental studies in animals have demonstrated that phytoestrogens are extremely effective in inhibiting mammary tumors, not only because they occupy estrogen receptors but also through other unrelated anticancer mechanisms.121,122 Plants manufacture thousands of chemical compounds that are vital to the health and function of the plant. Those chemical com- pounds, generally known as micronutrients, are consumed in the diet by humans whenever the plants are eaten. One of these classes of chemical compounds manufactured by plants comprises the phy- toestrogens. More than 300 plants contain phytoestrogen compounds. They compose a large part of our diet and are found in medicinal plants as well. There are several subclassifications of phytoestrogens; the partial list in Table 196.2 may be helpful. Phytoestrogens in medicinal herbs are capable of exerting estro- genic effects, although their activity is at most only 2% as strong as that of estrogen.123 Isoflavones have a structure similar to that of endogenous steroidal sex hormones. They have the ability to bind to estrogen receptors on human cells; in women, they have a pref- erence for binding to the beta form of the estrogen receptor. As a result, they preferentially express estrogenic effects in the central nervous system, blood vessels, bone, and skin without causing stim- ulation of the breast or uterus.124 In light of often confusing and contradictory research on meno- pausal HT, with slight risks as well as benefits, even more women are looking for safe and effective botanical alternatives for symptom relief. Botanical alternatives for menopausal symptoms are increasingly pop- ular despite limited research to demonstrate efficacy. Many women are determined to use nonhormonal therapies, bioidentical hormones, or lower-dose hormones in combination with botanicals in order to cre- ate a risk/benefit ratio they feel comfortable with.

## Black Cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa)

In the last 30 years, black cohosh has emerged as the most studied of the herbal alternatives to hormone replacement therapy for meno- pause symptoms (see Chapter 66 for a complete description). Despite some studies demonstrating no benefit of black cohosh, the collective findings in black cohosh studies and long-term clinical anecdotal evi- dence on black cohosh indicate that it is most effective for menopause symptoms of daytime or nighttime hot flashes, mood swings, sleep dis- orders, and body aches.125 In one of the largest studies, 629 women with menopausal com- plaints were seen by 131 general practitioners.126 In this study, as early as 4 weeks after beginning the therapy, a clear improvement in the menopausal ailments was seen in approximately 80% of the women. After 6 weeks, complete disappearance of symptoms occurred in approximately 50%. Some recent studies have used black cohosh in combination with other botanical extracts. For example, in a trial of black cohosh com- bined with St. John’s wort, healthy perimenopausal women with typ- ical climacteric symptoms and not on HT for at least the previous months were given a 264-mg tablet containing 0.364 mL of extract from black cohosh, equivalent to 1 mg terpene glycosides, and 84 mg of St. John’s wort extract with 0.25 mg hypericin.127 Forty-two women in the treatment group and 35 women in the placebo group completed the study. Mean Kupperman Index scores at 4 and 12 weeks were sig- nificantly lower in the treatment group (P ≤ 0.002). At the end of the study, the average decrease in the Kupperman Index was 20 points in the treatment group and only 8.2 points in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Vaginal dryness and low libido were two symptoms that did not improve, but the average hot flash score was significantly lower in the black cohosh/St. John’s wort group. In 2007 a clinical trial of a combination of black cohosh, red clover, soy, chaste tree, valerian, and vitamin E resulted in a significant low- ering of the mean score value of the Kupperman Index after 4 and months, yet it was found equal to placebo after 2 months.128 This mul- ticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 125 symptomatic postmenopausal women 45 to 65 years of age. The

supplement tested contained 72 mg of total isoflavones, with 60 mg of soy isoflavones and 12 mg of red cover isoflavones, in combination with the following: 40 mg of black cohosh extract, 30 mg of chaste-tree extract, 250 mg of valerian extract, and 121 mg of vitamin E. After months, the reduction in mean score value of the Kupperman Index was the same in the placebo and treatment groups. At months 4 and 6, the Kupperman Index was significantly lower in the treatment group (4 months: 13.6 score for placebo and 11.1 for treatment; 6 months: 12.2 for placebo and 9.6 for treatment). Secondarily, lipids were eval- uated. No difference was seen in total cholesterol or HDL-C, but there was a nonsignificant decrease (P = 0.0608) in LDL-C and a statisti- cally significant reduction in triglycerides (P = 0.0151) in the herbal treatment group. The study investigators’ and patients’ Clinical Global Impression scores for the treatment group were superior compared with placebo. Both herbal and placebo groups tolerated the treatment well, but a few individuals had mild and temporary side effects. Also in 2007, black cohosh was studied for its effects on lipids, fibrinogen, glucose, and insulin. In total, 351 perimenopausal or post- menopausal women aged 45 to 55 were randomized to a 3-month double-blind trial of either (1) black cohosh extract at 160 mg/day; (2) a multibotanical formula containing black cohosh, alfalfa, chaste- tree berry, dong quai, false unicorn, licorice root, oats, pomegranate, Siberian ginseng, and boron; (3) a multibotanical formula administered with boron and a soy diet with dietary counseling; (4) 0.625 mg of con- jugated equine estrogen with or without 2.5 mg of medroxyprogester- one acetate (women with a uterus received both medications, whereas women without a uterus received the estrogen only); or (5) a placebo.129 Although the primary objective of the study was to determine the effects on hot flashes, the secondary measures included the effects on lipids, fibrinogen, glucose, and insulin. Study participants were women who were experiencing hot flashes, mostly white women with college degrees. The average total and LDL-C levels were borderline high (219 and mg/dL); HDL-C was medium at 53 mg/dL, and triglycerides were nor- mal at 107 mg/dL. At the 3-month mark, there were no statistically significant treatment effects on total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, tri- glycerides, fibrinogen, glucose, or insulin among women who had any of the three herbal regimens (all three of which contained black cohosh). The evidence from this randomized controlled trial of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women does not support any short-term benefit or adverse effects of black cohosh on lipids, fibrinogen, glucose, or insulin when used alone, in combination with other botanicals, or in conjunc- tion with soy consumption. This is reassuring in that black cohosh does not appear to affect any thrombotic biomarkers, as does oral estrogen therapy (OET), nor does it increase triglycerides, as seen with OET. A 2014 systematic review also found that there was no association between black cohosh and breast cancer risk (with two studies report- ing a significant decrease in risk).130

## Hops (Humulus lupulus)

Hops have shown positive effects for mood issues, such as anxiety and restlessness, and for sleep disruptions in menopausal women. In one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 67 meno- pausal women were given either a placebo or 120 mg or 300 mg of standardized hop extract (providing 100 mcg and 250 mcg of 8-prenylnaringenin, respectively) for 12 weeks.131 At 6 weeks, the 120- mg dose was significantly superior to placebo, but not at 12 weeks. Even so, there was a more rapid decrease in menopausal symptoms scored for both doses of hop extract, especially the hot flash score. The higher dose was not any better than the lower one. In 2016 another randomized controlled trial found improvement in the Greene Climacteric Scale as well as a reduction in the number of hot flashes, using 500 mg powdered flowering hops (corymb).132 Another double-blind study in 36 menopausal women indicated significant reductions in the Kupperman Index and the visual analog scale (VAS) for the hops group and a marginal reduction in symptoms for the menopause rating scale (MRS) after 16 weeks.133

## Maca (Maca peruvianum)

Research on perimenopausal and menopausal women using a propri- etary maca product (Maca-GO) found that, unlike hormone replace- ment therapy (HT) and phytoestrogenic botanicals, maca can increase the body’s production of estrogen—versus simply adding estrogen replacement to the body—and lower levels of cortisol and adrenocorti- cotropic hormone.134 What makes this especially interesting is that, as evidenced by other research conducted on the composition of various powdered preparations of maca root, it appears that the herb does not contain plant estrogen or hormones.135–138 It has been suggested that maca’s therapeutic actions rely on plant sterols stimulating the hypo- thalamus, pituitary, adrenal, and ovarian glands and therefore also affecting the thyroid and pineal glands. Thus it has effects in improving sleep, mood, fertility, energy, and hot flashes. As such, maca tends to treat menopausal symptoms as a whole rather than only one specific symptom of menopause (such as hot flashes). In one double-blind, randomized 4-month study of 20 early- postmenopausal women, patients were given either placebo or two 500-mg capsules of Maca-GO twice daily for a total of 2 g/day.134 Menopausal symptoms were assessed according to Greene’s Score and the Kupperman Index. After 2 months, this maca product stimulated estradiol production and suppressed FSH, T3, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol. It also had a small effect on increasing bone density and alleviated numerous menopausal symptoms, includ- ing hot flashes, insomnia, depression, nervousness, and diminished concentration.19 A small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial comprising 14 postmenopausal women was completed using 3.5 g of powdered maca (Lepidium meyenii) for 6 weeks and matching placebo for 6 weeks.139 Measurements of estradiol, FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) were taken at baseline and then at weeks 6 and 12. The Greene Climacteric Scale was used to assess the severity of menopause symptoms. Serum concentrations of estradiol, FSH, LH, and SHBG were similar in both groups. The Greene Climacteric Scale revealed a significant reduction in psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction, after maca consumption compared with baseline and placebo. These findings were independent of androgenic or alpha- estrogenic activity present in the maca, using assays to measure hor- mone-dependent activity.

## Red Clover (Trifolium praetense)

Red clover, a member of the legume family, has been used worldwide as a source of hay for cattle, horses, and sheep and used by humans in the past as a source of protein in the leaves and young sprouts. Historically it has also been recognized as a medicinal plant for humans and, more recently, as a menopausal herb. The principal substances of red clover are the flavonoid glycosides, coumestans, volatile oils, l-dopa, caffeic acid conjugates, polysaccharides, and some miscellaneous resins, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, alcohols, chlorophylls, minerals, and vitamins. At least six clinical trials have been conducted on the effect of red clover isoflavones on vasomotor symptoms; three showed benefit and three did not. The first two published studies on red clover and vaso- motor symptoms showed no statistically significant difference between the red clover standardized extract and placebo during a 3-month period, although both groups did improve.140,141 It was suggested that the negative results of these studies were due to inadequate controls

and that women in the control group were in fact obtaining meaning- ful amounts of phytoestrogens in their diets. Two other studies using 40 mg of standardized red clover extract produced a 75% reduction in hot flashes after 16 weeks in 30 women. The difference between placebo and red clover isoflavones was statistically significant (P < 0.001).142 A similar study evaluating 40 mg of red clover standardized isoflavones for 2 months in 23 postmenopausal women found that the red clover users had a 54% reduction in hot flashes versus 30% in the placebo group.143 Two more recent studies continue the con- tradictions. In 2002 the use of 80 mg of isoflavones daily resulted in a significant reduction in hot flashes compared with baseline.144 Another study, called the ICE study, compared two different doses of red clover isoflavones—82 mg and 57 mg per day—with placebo for 12 weeks. The reductions in the mean daily hot flash count at 12 weeks were sim- ilar for both treated groups as well as the placebo group.145 Other intriguing effects of red clover reported by these studies are as follows: no endometrial thickening and an increase in HDL-C, as well as no abnormalities in liver function parameters, complete blood count, or estradiol determination. Last, a published study showed that red clover isoflavones may reduce the risk of coronary vascular disease by increasing arterial elasticity by 23%.146,147 A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that red clover was associated with a lower frequency of hot flashes and vaginal dryness, and objective markers of vaginal atrophy were also improved.148

## Siberian Rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum)

A special extract, ERr 731, from the roots of rhapontic rhubarb has been in wide use in Germany since 1993, specifically for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. This medicinal species of rhubarb is not the same species as the garden rhubarb used for food. Other rhubarb spe- cies included Rheum officinale, Rheum palmatum, and Rheum polygo- natum; these have been traditionally used as laxatives owing to their content of anthraquinone glycosides such as emodin and aloe-emodin. The R. rhaponticum used in clinical studies and in the extract form of Err 731 does not contain any emodin or aloe-emodin and thus has no laxative effects. A standardized extract, ERr 731, from the roots of R. rhaponticum, also known as Siberian rhubarb, was studied in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 109 perimenopausal women with climacteric complaints. One tablet (250 mg) containing 4 mg of dry extract was used in the treatment group (n = 54), whereas the control group (n = 55) received a placebo. The primary outcome was the change in the Menopause Rating Scale II (MRS II). After weeks, the MRS II total score and each MRS II symptom significantly decreased in the rhubarb extract group compared with the placebo group (P < 0.0001). The overall menopause quality-of-life score was also significantly better in the treatment group compared with placebo. No adverse events were observed.149 Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the standardized extract of R. rhaponticum was conducted in 109 perimenopausal women with menopausal symptoms, including anxiety. One tablet containing either 250 mg of ERr 731 (containing mg of R. rhaponticum dry extract) or placebo was given for 12 weeks. After only 4 weeks of treatment, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale total score and anxiety score for ERr 731 group decreased significantly. This was maintained after the 4 weeks and was even more significant after weeks of treatment. Anxiety decreased from moderate or severe to slight in 33 of 39 ERr 731 women. Quality-of-life issues also increased in the ERr 731 group far more significantly than in the placebo group, by 22.4 points versus 7.6 points.150 In an observational study, 363 menopausal women with menopausal symptoms were given one 4-mg tablet of ERr 731 for 6 months. The MRS was used to evaluate symptoms, and a change in the MRS was the primary outcome. After 6 months of treatment, 252 women completed the study. At that point, there was a significant decrease in the total MRS score from an average of 14.7 points at baseline to 6.9 points (P < 0.0001)—a decrease of 7.8 points. The most pronounced improvement occurred within the first 3 months of treatment in those women who were the most symptom- atic at baseline, with a score equal to or greater than 18 points. The most significant improvement was for symptoms of hot flashes, irritability, sleep problems, depressive mood, and physical/mental exhaustion.151

## St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)

Research on St. John’s wort extract has focused mainly on mild to moderate depression (see Chapter 88), and several studies have also considered menopausal symptoms. In a study published in 2010, a total of 100 women with an average age of 50 participated in a ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing St. John’s wort with placebo in women with perimenopausal/menopausal hot flashes.152 Fifty women received 20 drops three times daily of St. John’s wort extract (Hypiran) containing hypericin 0.2 mg/mL, and 50 women received a placebo of distilled water. The study duration was 2 months. Clinical examinations and interviews were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Treatment effectiveness was measured by the Blagg–Kupperman Index. Evaluation of the frequency, dura- tion, and severity of hot flashes was the main objective of the study. Forty-five women in the treatment group and 43 in the control group completed the study. In women taking St. John’s wort, the frequency of hot flashes began to decline during the first and second months, but more improve- ment was shown during the second month. There was no statistical change in hot flash frequency during the first month of placebo but some improvement during the second month. Women who used St. John’s wort showed more improvement in frequency than did those on placebo. The decline in the duration of hot flashes was statistically significant at week 8, and the decline was much more evident in the St. John’s wort arm. The severity of hot flashes was relieved by St. John’s wort during the 2 months of treatment and was more significant in the second month. Women in the placebo group did not show any significant decrease in the severity of hot flashes during the first month. They did have some improvement during the second month, but not as much as those in the St. John’s wort group. Another double-blind, randomized clinical trial studied the effect of St. John’s wort extract compared with placebo on symptoms and quality of life of 47 symptomatic perimenopausal women aged 40 to 65 with three or more hot flashes per day.153 Women were randomly assigned to receive a St. John’s wort extract (900 mg three times daily) or a placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment, a nonsignificant difference in favor of the St. John’s wort group was observed on the daily hot flash frequency and the hot flash severity scores. After 3 months of treat- ment, women in the St. John’s wort group reported significantly better quality-of-life scores and significantly fewer sleep problems compared with those on placebo. A drug-monitoring study conducted in women with menopausal symptoms using 900 mg of St. John’s wort for 12 weeks found that about three-quarters of the women experienced improvement in both the self-rating scale and the physician rating; they also improved sig- nificantly in psychological and psychosomatic symptoms as well as a feeling of sexual well-being.154 Several double-blind studies have used a combination of St. John’s wort and black cohosh extract. These studies have been described previously. Although it appears to be common for practitioners to use chaste tree (Vitex agnus castus) in perimenopause and menopausal women

## 1564SECTION 6 Diseases

for symptom relief, there have been no mono-ingredient studies on this plant for these symptoms. Vitex has been shown to be helpful when combined with black cohosh. The most recent menopause-related study using Vitex was in combination with St. John’s wort. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 16-week trial of late- perimenopausal or postmenopausal women who reported hot flashes and other menopause symptoms, the herbal combination showed no significant difference from that of placebo.155

## Kava (Piper methysticum)

Kava has most often been associated with analgesic, sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. It is not typically thought of as an herb for menopause; however, anxiety, irritability, tension, nervousness, and sleep disruption are common perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms for which kava can offer some help. Several controlled trials have investigated the value of kava for menopausal symptoms.156–158 The main results noted were a significant reduction in anxiety and depression. For more information on the pharmacology of kava, see Chapter 103.

## Ginseng (Panax ginseng)

Panax ginseng, also known as Korean or Chinese ginseng, contains at least 13 different triterpenoid saponins, collectively known as ginseno- sides. Whether it involves reducing mental or physical fatigue,159–162 enhancing the ability to cope with various physical and mental stress- ors by supporting the adrenal glands,163 or treating the atrophic vaginal changes due to lack of estrogen,164 ginseng is a valuable tool for many menopausal women. In one trial, a standardized extract of P. ginseng was studied in 384 postmenopausal women.165 In 2016 a systematic review of ginseng was published, indicating evidence of improvement in total hot flash score, as well as sexual function and arousal. No effect was consistently found for hot flash frequency, hormone levels, or endometrial thickness.166 Depression and well-being showed a statistically significant improvement with ginseng. In another randomized controlled trial, 1 month of P. ginseng increased energy and decreased insomnia and depression.167 These results indicate that P. ginseng can significantly improve the general sense of well-being of women going through menopause.

## Kudzu (Pueraria mirifica)

Pueraria mirifica was examined for its effect on vaginal symptoms, vag- inal health index, vaginal pH, and vaginal cytology in postmenopausal women.168 In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 51 women were given either 20, 30, or 50 mg of Pueraria mir- ifica or placebo daily for 24 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, sig- nificant improvements in vaginal symptoms were seen, and they were maintained over the study period. The mean vaginal dryness symp- toms decreased at all the herbal doses, but the results were not signifi- cantly different from those seen in the placebo group. The frequency of dyspareunia decreased from 56.9% to 39.2% in the study group, whereas it did not change in the placebo group. The changes in the vaginal health index (scoring vaginal appearance with regard to mois- ture, fluid volume, elasticity, epithelial integrity, and pH on a scale of 1, poorest, to 5, best) were significantly improved in the herbal group, as noted in weeks 12 and 24. Before treatment, the mean vaginal pH was 8.41 in the treated group; after 12 and 24 weeks, the mean pH was 5.52 and 5.83, respectively. After 12 weeks of treatment, most measures of vaginal health in the treated group were significantly higher than in the placebo group. After 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, the maturation value and mat- uration index were also significantly higher in the study group than in the placebo group. In essence, P. mirifica improved the parabasal:in- termediate:superficial cells ratio, which is what occurs when vaginal estrogen is used. There were no statistically significant changes in endometrial thickness and no significant difference in adverse effects between the treatment and placebo groups. A 12-week prospective and randomized trial published in found that although P. mirifica gel was not as effective as CEE for improving signs of vaginal atrophy, it did improve the vaginal mat- uration index significantly, with no significant difference in symptom scores between the two groups.169

## Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis)

By far the most popular use of Angelica species has been the use of Angelica sinensis in the treatment of menopausal complaints. Although a double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed no significant bene- fit, the preparation used (a dried aqueous extract) was clearly lacking some of the important volatile compounds, although it was stan- dardized for ferulic acid content.170 In addition, the traditional use of Angelica has been in combination with other plants. A study conducted in China showed that a combination of A. sinensis, Paeonia lactiflora, Ligusticum monnieri, Atractylodes chinensis, Sclerotium poriae, and Alisma orientalis was effective in roughly 70% of women experienc- ing menopausal symptoms.171 Although not a double-blind study, this study shows promise for using Angelica in the management of meno- pausal symptoms in combination with other compounds. Also, in a double-blind study, the combination of 100 mg Angelica, 60 mg soy isoflavones, and 50 mg of black cohosh extract significantly reduced menstrual migraines.172 Interestingly, in an in vitro study with human bone, the aqueous extract of A. sinensis was found to directly stimulate proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, protein secretion, and type I collagen synthesis in a dose-dependent manner.173 These results indicate the A. sinensis may have an effect on preventing age-related bone loss.

## Valerian

A double-blind study on the impact of valerian for sleep quality in postmenopausal women who were experiencing insomnia concluded that valerian may be helpful. The postmenopausal women studied were generally healthy women 50 to 60 years of age who were meno- pausal for at least 1 year, were not using a hormone therapy, and were experiencing insomnia as evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). One group of women was given capsules containing mg of concentrated valerian extract twice per day, and the other group was given a placebo twice per day, for 4 weeks. A statistically signifi- cant change was reported in the quality of sleep in the valerian group compared with the placebo group. The average score on the sleep scale before valerian was 9.8, and after valerian, it was 6.02. The placebo group had an initial average sleep scale score of 11.1 and a score of 9.4 after placebo. Overall, 30% of the women taking valerian and 4% tak- ing placebo reported an improvement in their sleep quality.174 Interestingly, although valerian is typically used to improve sleep, a 2018 triple-blind randomized trial also found it to be effective for reducing hot flash frequency when given at 530 mg, twice per day.175

## Conventional Medications

Nonhormonal options for hot flashes include clonidine, usually 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily at bedtime. The neuroleptic Neurontin is administered at 300 mg three times daily. Venlafaxine and paroxetine have shown a reduction in hot flashes in studies using 37.5 to 75 mg and 10 to 20 mg daily, respectively. However, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have occasionally been shown to cause vasomotor symptoms in both men and women.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1565CHAPTER 196 Menopause

Bellergal, an ergot and belladonna combination, was used for many years for vasomotor symptoms but is now available only from com- pounding pharmacies. There are no studies, and empirical reports show mixed results.

# HORMONE THERAPY

Recommending estrogen/progestogen HT, regardless of its source or makeup, requires weighing the benefits and risks of short- and long- term treatment. These benefits and risks continually change for any individual woman as she ages, as her menopause-related symptom pic- ture and her general health change. Risk factors are related to baseline diseases and the risks they incur, age, age at menopause, and cause of menopause (surgical, physiological, medication induced), as well as the prior use of HT, including route of administration and response or medical problems that emerged during HT treatment. It is easy for practitioners to be confused by the last 60 years of research on HT, but understanding the benefits and risks of HT is crit- ical to sound clinical decision making and the education of patients. Any HT, whether bioidentical or nonbioidentical, should be used at the lowest dose, for the shortest duration, and in the safest way pos- sible. Each type of estrogen and progestogen, route of administration, timing of initiation, and duration of use will have distinct benefits and adverse effects. The NAMS has strongly recommended that new uniform and con- sistent terminology be adopted in describing HT in menopause man- agement. The NAMS menopausal HT terminology is as follows4: • EPT: combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (form of estrogen and progestogen is not specific) • ET: estrogen therapy (the form of estrogen is not specific) • HT: hormone therapy (encompassing ET and EPT; the form of estrogen and progestogen is not specific) • Local therapy: vaginal ET administration that does not result in clinically significant systemic absorption (the form of estrogen is not specific) • Progestogen: encompassing both progesterone and progestin • Systemic therapy: HT administration that results in absorption in the blood high enough to provide clinically significant effects • Timing of HT initiation: length of time after menopause occurs when HT is initiated Additional terms that can be helpful in making distinctions between hormone regimens (not NAMS terminology) are as follows: • cHT: conventional HT (FDA-approved prescription items) • cET: conventional estrogen therapy (FDA-approved prescription items) • bHT: bioidentical HT (FDA-approved prescription items) • bET: bioidentical estrogen therapy (FDA-approved prescription items) • cbHT: compounded bioidentical HT (from a compounding phar- macy) • cbET: compounded bioidentical estrogen therapy (from a com- pounding pharmacy)

## Bioidentical or Natural Hormones

One of the greatest areas of confusion in menopausal management today is the subject of bioidentical or natural hormones. Bioidentical estrogens require a prescription and are available from regular phar- macies or as nonpatented forms prepared by compounding pharma- cies. The advantages of conventional pharmaceutical HT include years of scientific study and the assurance of standardization. Insurance coverage generally pays for pharmaceutical hormone prescriptions but does not always pay for compounded hormones. Pharmaceutical preparations are limited in dose forms and combinations; they also con- tain additives, binders, adhesives, and/or preservatives. Occasionally these substances can cause side effects, including skin reactions, head- aches, and digestive problems. The use of compounded forms of hormones has three distinct inar- guable advantages in that there is a greater array of dosing, hormone combinations, and delivery options. Customized doses of a particular hormone are available that pharmaceutical companies do not make. Compounded hormones also are available in capsules, sublingual lozenges or pellets, creams, gels, vaginal creams/gels or tablets, nasal sprays, injections, and subcutaneous implanted pellets. In addition, any combination of estradiol, estriol, estrone, progesterone, testoster- one, and DHEA can be formulated in a compounded hormone pre- scription to best meet the individual needs of the patient.

## Bioidentical Estrogens

Some would argue that the advantage of conventional pharmaceutical company HT is that it has undergone years of scientific study. Although this is true, there has been little effort to make distinctions between different kinds of estrogens in particular. To a lesser degree but still true, there has not been much effort to distinguish between the various progestins (synthetic) and bioidentical progesterone. Whereas many alternative practitioners point to the superior safety profile of bioiden- tical estrogens over nonbioidentical estrogens, it cannot be stated with science-based facts that an equivalent dose of bioidentical estradiol is innately safer or better than the synthetic form or CEE. Whereas logic and common sense might lead us to assert that a bioidentical estrogen is more akin to the body’s enzymatic pathways, bowel flora, and gen- eral physiology, thus leading to enhanced safety, we have yet to ade- quately prove this. Indeed, a retrospective analysis of previous studies published in 2018 suggested that the breast cancer reduction benefit with CEE alone is greater than with bioidentical estrogen alone.176 For now, it remains in the realm of hypotheticals and philosophical issues. The ability to individualize prescriptions with compounded bioidentical hormones can provide endless customized options with the ability to be flexible in dosing and delivery according to the needs of each woman. If for no other reason, this is compelling enough rea- son to prescribe compounded bioidentical hormones. The combina- tion of estriol with estradiol and the use of bioidentical progesterone and testosterone with the estrogens provides the maximum potential benefit and a more individualized approach for each patient. The hope is that there is less risk that nonbioidentical hormones in the case of combining the weaker estriol with estradiol/estrone. Estriol seems to be helpful in treating many of the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes. Vaginal estriol for vaginal dryness is considered a potentially preferred form of vaginal estrogen owing to the dominance of estriol receptors in the vagina and vulva. Alternative practitioners often use estriol to treat menopausal symp- toms because it is thought to have a better safety profile than estradiol and estrone. Estriol is about one fourth as potent as estradiol.177 Estriol can be taken orally in capsules or tablets and intravaginally as a cream. Vaginal estriol creams and suppositories have been shown to restore normal vaginal cytology178 and to decrease the incidence of bladder infections.179 These creams most likely work by restoring the vaginal flora; improving vaginal and bladder health; and increasing the lubrication, elasticity, and thickness of the vaginal epithelium. A common prescrip- tion is 1 mg of estriol per gram of cream inserted vaginally daily for weeks and then twice a week for maintenance. A popular practice for prescribing compounded bioidentical estro- gens is to combine the lower dose and perhaps potentially safer effects of estriol with small doses of estradiol and estrone. Currently, those

## 1566SECTION 6 Diseases

who prescribe a triple-estrogen compound typically use a formula com- posed of 80% estriol, 10% estradiol, and 10% estrone. Progesterone is added to the formula at a minimum of 100 mg/day to protect the uterus from the potential effects of the estrogen in thickening the lin- ing of the endometrium. Use of estrogen only, without the proper dose of progesterone, in women with a uterus might put them at risk for endometrial hyperplasia or even endometrial (uterine) cancer. A biestrogen formulation, with estriol and estradiol, is increas- ingly popular because of concerns that estrone may be associated with more carcinogenic estrogen metabolites, which are associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer. (Recommended dose ratios for both triestrogen and biestrogen formulations are discussed later.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Progesterone

Progesterone is available with a prescription as oral capsules, sublin- gual drops, sublingual pellets, lozenges, transvaginal or rectal supposi- tories, and by injection. Progesterone is also available over the counter as a cream. Progesterone is added to a compounded biestrogen or tri- estrogen formulas at a minimum of 100 mg/day to protect the uterus. For women with a uterus, a progestogen must be added to any estrogen preparation to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and uterine cancer. Progesterone is a natural hormone made by the ovaries, and its main function is to support pregnancy. Progestin is the term applied to the synthetic derivatives, which differ in biochemical structure from progesterone. Progestins used in conventional HT and birth control pills often account for the side effects that patients experience, such as irritability, depression, bloating, and mood swings. Progestins tend to cause water retention, can affect brain chemistry, and alter other steroid pathways. Progestogen is the term applied to any substance pos- sessing progesterone qualities. It can refer to progesterone or progestin. The advantages of bioidentical progesterone over progestins are better validated than are the advantages of estrogens, although, as mentioned previously, an increase in risk for endometrial cancer with oral micronized progesterone but not synthetic progestins in both the French and European studies is concerning. Bioidentical progesterone minimizes the side effects associated with progestogens and has a more favorable effect on lipid profiles and car- diovascular function.180 In some women, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings may be more responsive to progesterone than estrogen.

## Progesterone Cream

Bioidentical progesterone by itself can also be used very effectively in perimenopause. Problems that can be addressed include regulation of the menstrual cycle, hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, sleep dis- ruption, and premenstrual symptoms. A transdermal progesterone cream was studied for its ability to con- trol vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) and in order to evaluate its abil- ity to prevent bone loss. In this study, 102 healthy women within 5 years of menopause were randomly assigned to receive either transdermal progesterone cream or a placebo.181 Subjects were instructed to apply a 1/4 tsp of cream (this amount contained 20 mg progesterone or pla- cebo) to the skin daily. Each also received a multivitamin and 1200 mg of calcium. Measurements included medical history, physical examina- tion, DEXA scanning of the hip and spine, measurements of thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) and FSH, a lipids profile (cholesterol, etc.), and a regular blood chemistry profile. The women kept weekly symptom diaries and were seen every 4 months for 1 year. Bone density scanning and blood chemistry profiles were obtained again at the end of 1 year. Before the initiation of the study, 30 of the 43 (69%) in the treat- ment group and 26 of the 47 (55%) in the placebo group had hot flashes. Twenty-five of 30 (83%) women in the treatment group experienced improvement or resolution of the hot flashes, and 5 of 26 (19%) placebo subjects showed improvement or resolution. The numbers of women who showed a gain in bone mineral density did not differ in the two groups. The latest randomized clinical trial compared the effect of a trans- dermal natural progesterone cream (32 mg/day) with a placebo cream. Eighty postmenopausal women in Australia were randomly assigned to each group. They were evaluated using the Greene Climacteric Scale and the Menopause Quality of Life Questionnaire; serum lipid levels and bone markers were also monitored over 12 weeks. No detectable change was seen in vasomotor symptoms, moods, libido, serum lipid levels, or metabolic markers of bone turnover. There was a slight ele- vation of blood levels of progesterone. The researchers concluded that the 32 mg of transdermal progesterone was not sufficiently absorbed into the bloodstream to achieve biological effects.182

## Testosterone

The majority of women treated with estrogen replacement have a res- olution of their menopausal symptoms. For those who do not, and especially for those complaining of a loss of libido, estrogen with tes- tosterone may be beneficial. One study of early postmenopausal women (both natural and sur- gical) who were switched from estrogen alone to estrogen/testosterone therapy found that overall symptom relief was superior to estrogen-only therapy. Sex drive and satisfaction both increased.183 A double-blind study of women dissatisfied with their HT regimens showed that sex- ual desire, satisfaction, and frequency of sexual activity were increased when they used the estrogen/testosterone combination.184 Other studies have shown that the combination of 1.25 mg of ester- ified estrogen and 2.5 mg of methyltestosterone given daily for 2 years after surgical menopause significantly reduced the intensity of hot flashes and vaginal dryness in 81% and 73% of women, respectively.185 A trial comprising 814 postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire revealed that a 300-g testosterone patch improved the frequency of satisfying sexual episodes and decreased their distress.186 In this study, the women were not treated with estrogen or proges- terone. Three excess cases of breast cancer were detected but were not statistically significant. Formulations of CEE and methyltestosterone combined either 0.625 or 1.25 mg of CEE with 5 mg of methyltestos- terone. Other preparations come as either 1.25 or 0.625 esterified estro- gens combined with 2.5 or 1.25 mg of methyltestosterone, respectively. At present, bioidentical testosterone can be obtained only from a com- pounding pharmacy, where 4 to 6 mg of bioidentical testosterone is gen- erally formulated alone or together with the biestrogen or triestrogen formulation. Testosterone cream applied to the genital region can be used as an alternative delivery method. Common prescriptions are any- where from 1 to 10 mg/g of cream. The cream is applied to the external genitalia just before sexual activity to enhance sensitivity to touch and orgasm. Such use should not occur more than twice a week to avert local testosterone side effects, such as clitoral enlargement. The NAMS con- cluded that “Postmenopausal women with decreased sexual desire who have no cause other than being postmenopausal, may be candidates for testosterone treatment.” Other causes of low libido should be ruled out, and laboratory testing of testosterone levels should be used to monitor for supraphysiological levels before and during therapy. Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in women with breast or uterine cancer and in those with cardiovascular or liver disease. Testosterone should be given at the lowest dose for the shortest time that meets treatment objectives.

humans. DHEA is called a precursor hormone because it is produced in large amounts in the body and because other steroid hormones are made from DHEA, including estrogen and testosterone. Many claims have been made about DHEA’s effect on the immune system, and its antiaging properties are said to include better memory, less fatigue, more energy, relaxation, and increased ability to handle stress. It is also touted as having positive effects on bone density and helping to prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, the exact effect DHEA has on the body’s cells is unclear. Observationally, DHEA may increase energy, improve stress response, improve muscle mass, and occasionally increase libido. However, in the DAWN trial, DHEA supplementation of 50 mg/day did not improve well-being or cognitive performance in healthy older adults.187 In a 1-year study with 10 mg/day of DHEA alone or in combination with HT in postmeno- pausal women, DHEA was able to restore the androgenic milieu and had a positive effect on estrogenic tone in postmenopausal women.188 (There also appears to be an insulin-sensitizing effect of DHEA, reduc- ing abdominal visceral fat, lowering insulin level, and producing a sig- nificant increase in insulin sensitivity.)189 Perhaps the most intriguing use of DHEA in menopausal women is for vaginal atrophy and/or sexual dysfunction. One study used three doses of DHEA ovules (0.25%, or 3.25 mg DHEA; 0.5%, or 6.5 mg DHEA; and 1.0%, or 13 mg DHEA) in 54 women; this was applied daily intravaginally for 12 weeks.190 All three doses induced a significant beneficial change in vaginal epithelial cells, pH, and bothersome symptoms at 2 weeks. These benefits were accomplished with no effect on endometrial histology and no or minimal effects on serum estrogens and androgens and their metabolites. Another intravaginal DHEA study was a prospective, ran- domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the effect of daily local intravaginal DHEA ovules for 12 weeks in postmenopausal women.191 The main assessment criteria were sexual dysfunction parame- ters of libido, arousal, orgasm, and dyspareunia in postmenopausal women who had vaginal atrophy. In this study, 218 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive a daily ovule of either no DHEA, 3.25 mg DHEA, 6.5 mg DHEA, or 13 mg of DHEA. At 12 weeks, compared with placebo, the 13-mg ovule showed a 68% improvement in the abbreviated sexual function arousal/sensation domain, in the arousal/lubrication domain by 39%, in orgasm by 75%, and in dryness during intercourse by 57%. DHEA also fared better than placebo in the desire domain of menopause-specific quality of life by 49% to 23%. Subsequent randomized trials with intravaginal DHEA have sup- ported the clinical benefits for dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vul- vovaginal atrophy.192

## Nonbioidentical Hormones

Nonbioidentical conventional HT includes estrogens manufactured by a pharmaceutical company that are not identical in chemical structure to an endogenous hormone. As examples, conjugated equine estrogens are derived from the urine of pregnant mares. Esterified estrogens are in part estrone sulfate and in part equilin sulfates. Progestins are syn- thetic substances. Oral capsules containing 1 mg of bioidentical hormones are equiv- alent to 0.625 mg of CEE. Estrogen patches that contain 0.05 mg of bioidentical estradiol are considered to be equivalent to 0.625 mg CEE (Premarin) or 0.625 mg of esterified estrogens and equivalent to 1 mg of oral bioidentical estradiol. Current products are available through the NAMS. Recommended dose ratios for triestrogen and biestrogen formula- tions with progesterone are as follows: • A triestrogen formulation is considered comparable with 0.625 mg Premarin/2.5 mg Provera = estriol 1 mg/estradiol 0.125 mg/estrone 0.125 mg/Prog 50 mg 1 cap twice a day. • Or estriol 2 mg/estradiol 0.25 mg/estrone 0.25 mg/Prog 100 mg 1 cap a day A biestrogen formulation is considered comparable with: • 0.625 mg Premarin/2.5 mg Provera = estriol 1 mg/estradiol 0.250 mg/Prog 50 mg, 1 cap twice a day, or estriol 2 mg/estradiol 0.50 mg/ Prog 100 mg, 1 cap a day • Vaginal estriol: estriol cream 1 mg/g; insert 1 g nightly for 2 weeks then a maintenance of twice a week.

## Perimenopause–Menopause Evaluation

The onset of perimenopause–menopause is an important time for a comprehensive health and lifestyle evaluation. A comprehensive med- ical history and complete physical examination are essential before initiating menopausal HT of any kind. Assessment of risk factors for stroke, CHD, venous thrombotic embolism, osteoporosis, diabetes, and breast/ovarian/uterine cancer is highly recommended. DEXA test- ing, lipid profiles, fasting glucose, and mammography should be per- formed according to national guidelines, age, and medical judgment. Other selected tests depend on age, symptoms, and other medical problems. There is no one test for menopause. Tests to determine ovarian function are not routinely done because the diagnosis of perimeno- pause or menopause can largely be made based on the medical history. Practitioners can use hormone testing on an individual basis, mostly to differentiate menopause from thyroid problems, abnormal causes of a lack of menses such as elevated prolactin levels, or premature ovarian failure (premature menopause). The FSH test is not as accurate as one would like in a perimenopausal woman. The difficulty with FSH tests is that they can fluctuate immensely during perimenopause. What a woman’s FSH is on any given day is not meaningful in diagnosing her symptoms as being due to menopausal changes or not. In a woman who is still having menses, especially irregular/random cycles, as is often the case in perimenopause, the FSH fluctuates unpredictably; it can easily be within normal range on a certain day and elevated on another. In fact, FSH tests are frequently normal in perimenopausal women, and a physician with lack of experience in menopausal/midlife patients may mistakenly attribute symptoms to depression, anxiety, or unknowns rather than to perimenopause. There are two regular sce- narios to consider for ordering an FSH: (1) If a woman is suspected to be perimenopausal or menopausal and is using contraception, the FSH can be useful in determining whether she still needs contraception. An FSH above 30 mIU/mL that is also above 30 mIU/mL when repeated 1 month later would justify a diagnosis of menopause. It is important to continue the contraception during that 1-month period until this is determined. (2) If a woman is reporting irregular menses, irritability, fatigue, insomnia, and so on, an FSH and a TSH test will be helpful in sorting out her problems. There is a popular notion, especially among alternative health care providers, that saliva or serum testing or urinary hormone testing can be done to determine hormone management. One major problem with this thinking is that there is little or no value in these tests in a perimenopausal woman for the purpose of diagnosing her hormone levels. What her levels are on the hour/day(s) of the test is the only information that is gleaned, but this is not diagnostic of perimeno- pause, and as mentioned, it is highly variable. There is no scientific evi- dence to support claims of increased efficacy, enhanced safety, or need for testing in order to determine the dosing of the hormonal prescrip- tions. In particular, there are numerous problems with saliva testing of estrogen and progesterone: (1) There is only a very small amount of these hormones in the saliva; (2) there are high false-positive eleva- tions in those already taking a sublingual hormone; (3) there may be contamination of the saliva collection tube if a patient is already using

## 1568SECTION 6 Diseases

topical hormone creams/gels; (4) there is little proficiency testing; (5) varying technologies yield broad differences in results; (6) technical challenges are not adequately addressed by all laboratories conduct- ing these tests; (7) there is a lack of scientifically proved accuracy; and (8) there are interfering components, such as food, beverages, medica- tions, and chewing gum. Salivary testing of cortisol and DHEA levels holds more promise because these do not fluctuate so much from day to day, we have a known daily rhythm of cortisol production, and there are naturally higher amounts of these in the saliva than of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Serum testing of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone has proven to be more accurate with standardized methods of measuring. However, it is not often that even these are necessary tests in perimeno- pausal and menopausal women. For one, the reference ranges are often wide, and with testosterone in particular, we are not even sure what the normal reference range of testosterone is for women. Again, in a perimenopausal woman, estrogen levels in particular fluctuate from day to day and therefore are not valuable in diagnosis or management. In a postmenopausal woman, estrogen and progesterone levels are pre- dictably low, as they are supposed to be. Although saliva estrogen/progesterone testing has yet to prove its accuracy or efficacy, even if it were accurate, neither salivary nor serum hormone testing is necessary or even helpful for the perimenopausal woman because it is difficult to draw conclusions from test results when the hormones are in such a fluctuating state. There are so many peaks and valleys and erratic hormone activity that testing offers little value in most situations. For the women taking HT, it is tempting to think that the blood or saliva could be tested to determine dose. This is a popular recommendation in some consumer menopause books. However, there is no mathematical grid or equation comparing values of estrogen or progesterone or testosterone levels in the blood or saliva and how that would equate with a certain dose of the comparable hor- mone. There are reference ranges for these hormones, but we do not know exactly what dose to give in order to keep a patient within the reference range. Women absorb and metabolize hormones differently. The form of the hormones and the delivery method—oral, transder- mal, sublingual, injection—are also different from woman to woman. In very occasional and selective cases, serum testing may be a helpful guide, but these are generally cases in which a woman is on HT and not doing well, and despite our best efforts with a good medical history and adjusting the dose, she still does not feel well. The majority of the time, it requires the practitioner’s experience and menopause expertise and time to listen to the patient to know what dose to prescribe and what dosing adjustments and forms and deliveries of hormones may work best. Even if testing is done, it basically comes down to good clinical judgment and the willingness of the woman and her practitioner to try something else. Urinary testing of estrogen metabolites can be considered in eval- uating a woman’s risk of health problems that may be associated with higher or lower levels of certain estrogen metabolites. Although such data are limited, the use of estrogen metabolism testing to try to gain some insight as to a patient’s risk of cervical and breast cancer in particular or how to decrease the recurrence of these diseases is a preventive medicine practice that is hard to argue with. A complete discussion of the metabolites of the various forms of estrogen, proges- terones, DHEA, and testosterone is beyond the scope of this chapter. As an example, the metabolites of one estrogen, estrone, are known to play both oncogenic and antioncogenic roles. Estrone’s oncogenic metabolites, 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH estrone), considered the most carcinogenic estrogen metabolite, and α -OH estrone (needed in small amounts because of its bone-building actions), are produced by Phase I metabolism. Estrone’s protective metabolites (2-hydroxyestrone [2-OH estrone], 2-methoxyestrone [2-CH3O-estrone], and estriol [E3]) are produced in Phase II metabolism. The primary value of these tests is that they help the clinician to use nutrients, botanicals, and lifestyle modification to facilitate the optimal metabolism of these hormones through the pathways that lead to the potential for the reduction of breast and cervical cancers. Practitioners should be encouraged to rethink the use of salivary and serum estrogen/progesterone testing in the diagnosis and manage- ment of perimenopausal/menopausal symptoms. In the perimenopausal woman, these hormones fluctuate within a day and from day to day. In the postmenopausal woman not on hormones, I would also assert that this is a poor use of a woman’s funds. Her estrogen and progester- one levels are low. She is a postmenopausal woman, and Mother Nature had this in mind. It is rarely necessary to test the estrogen levels of a postmenopausal woman on HT for prescription management; however, there are times when testing may help to determine absorption/delivery and dosing issues when there is a lack of response or an adverse response to customary prescriptions. For select and very difficult cases, it is likely more useful to use the testing of neurotransmitters, amino acids, and nutrients while ensuring that due diligence has been done with regard to the basics of history, physical examination, and conventional testing.


Menopause is a normal and natural part of aging, and each woman experiences it in her own way. However, premature, surgical, or medication-induced menopause is not normal and should be addressed with individual consideration as to the benefits and risks of each ther- apy. Using natural therapies, HT, other pharmaceuticals, or some combination of each is a personal decision for each woman. Our views of menopause and aging and our concerns about long-term health problems evolve over time. Balance is necessary, and the overmedi- calization of menopause is inappropriate. The integrative provider can remind women that menopause can be a time of positive, life-changing insights, empowerment, and personal growth. Many natural measures can help alleviate the most common symp- toms of menopause. In most cases, HT either is not necessary or is needed for only 1 to 4 years. However, in women at high risk for oste- oporosis and those who have already experienced significant bone loss and also have menopausal symptoms or do not tolerate osteoporosis medications, HT may be indicated. For women who have menopausal symptoms that they are not tolerating well, bHT, cbHT, or cHT can be used, with periodic attempts at reducing or discontinuing the hormones.

# DIET

Consumption of foods that may provide modest symptom relief, such as soy foods, legumes in general, and flaxseeds, should be increased. A whole-foods, Mediterranean-type diet that addresses the prevention or management of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis should also be attended to.

# SUPPLEMENTS

• Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 800 IU/day until symptoms have improved, then 400 IU/day • Hesperidin: 900 mg/day; or PCOs from grape seed or pine bark: 200 mg/day • Vitamin C: 1200 mg/day • Consider gamma-oryzanol: 300 mg/day

## 1569CHAPTER 196 Menopause

# BOTANICAL MEDICINES

Choose one or more of the following for general symptom relief: • Standardized extract of black cohosh: 40 mg to 80 mg/day • Gelatinized maca extract: 1000 mg twice a day or dose equivalent to 3500 dried powdered maca root a day • Red clover extract: 40 to 80 mg/day Choose one of the following if symptoms of anxiety or depression are significant (can be used with the previous list): • Hops extract standardized for 8-prenylnaringenin: 120 to 300 mg/ day • Kava extract: 45 to 80 mg of kavalactones three times a day • St. John’s wort extract standardized to 0.3% hypericin: 900 to mg/day Choose the following if symptoms of vaginal atrophy do not respond after 2 months of treatment with other botanical(s): • Kudzu: dried powdered root 20 to 50 mg a day Choose the following if symptoms of menopausal migraine are significant: • 100 mg A. sinensis extract, 60 mg soy isoflavones, and 50 mg of black cohosh extract a day If symptoms do not sufficiently improve, consider HT.

# LIFESTYLE

Facilitate a regular exercise program, at least 30 minutes four times a week. For weight loss in midlife women, it is likely that 60 minutes of exercise every day will be needed to combat insulin resistance and achieve successful weight loss.

that the problem is “dysfunctional uterine bleeding” (DUB)— defined as abnormal uterine bleeding without any demonstrable organic cause.

## Abnormalities in Prostaglandin Metabolism

The etiology of structural menorrhagia is currently believed to involve abnormalities in the biochemical processes of the endometrium that control the supply of arachidonic acid for prostaglandin synthesis.6,7 Menorrhagic endometrium incorporates arachidonic acid into neutral lipids to a much greater extent than normal, whereas its incorpora- tion into phospholipids is lower. The greater arachidonic acid release during menstruation results in the higher production of series 2 prosta- glandins, which are thought to be the major factor both in the excessive bleeding seen at menstruation and in the symptoms of dysmenorrhea (Fig. 197.1). The excessive bleeding during the first 3 days appears to be due to the vasodilatory properties of prostaglandins (PGs) E 2 and PGI 2 and the antiaggregating activity of PGI 2 , whereas the pain of dysmen- orrhea is due to the overproduction of PGF 2a .

## Thyroid Abnormalities

The association of overt hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism with menstrual disturbances is well known.5,8 However, even minimal thyroid dysfunction, particularly minimal subclinical insufficiency as determined by testing the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), may be responsible for menorrhagia and other menstrual disturbances.9 Patients with minimal thyroid insufficiency and menorrhagia have shown dramatic responses to thyroxine.9 It has been recommended that patients with long-standing menstrual dysfunction (who have no obvious uterine disease) should be considered for TSH testing. This approach is preferable to the empiric use of thyroid hormone.

## Estimating Menstrual Blood Loss

Physicians often believe that they can assess menstrual blood loss by asking the patient to estimate the number of pads or tampons used during each period and the duration of the period. However, stud- ies have demonstrated that there is no correlation between measured blood loss and these assessments.10,11 A woman’s assessment of her blood loss is extremely subjective, as demonstrated by one study find- ing that 40% of women with a menstrual blood loss exceeding 80 mL considered their periods only moderately heavy or scanty, whereas 14% of those with a measured loss of less than 20 mL judged their periods to be heavy.11 Serum ferritin levels may be the best indicator of excessive men- strual blood loss, but their determination may not be practical in terms of immediate need to know. Despite inaccuracies of patient reporting, it is important for the clinician to make an attempt at understanding the quantity of blood loss. Excessive blood loss should be a concern if a woman is bleeding longer than 7 straight days or more frequently than every 21 days and is changing a pad or tampon every hour for more than half a day. Women who are changing a pad and/or tampon every half hour or even more often require urgent, perhaps emergency atten- tion. Symptoms of light-headedness, dizziness, fainting, or the like are cause for immediate concern. Any amount of bleeding in a postmeno- pausal woman is considered abnormal, unless it clearly results from withdrawal of exogenous hormones.5

## Conventional Medicine

The first line of therapy for menorrhagia in conventional medicine is hormonal (progestin intrauterine device [IUD], combined hormonal contraceptives, cyclic oral progestogens, progesterone only, danazol, or ulipristal acetate) and/or hemostatic therapies (tranexamic acid or 1-deamino-8-arginine).1 Only when those therapies are ineffective are more aggressive and invasive therapies performed, such as endometrial ablation, dilation and curettage (D&C), polypectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and hysterectomy.1,3 Although the need for hysterectomy is recognized in select circumstances, most cases of menorrhagia can be treated with nonsurgical therapies, including botanicals, nutritional interventions, and hormonal and pharmaceu- tical therapies.

## Psychological Considerations

Stress was shown to affect bleeding patterns directly by influencing the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal–ovarian axis, as shown in an animal study.12 However, there are conflicting clinical trials demonstrating the significance of stress and menorrhagia.13,14

## Nutrition

## Iron Deficiency

A menstrual blood loss exceeding 60 mL per period is associated with negative iron balance in most cases.15 Although menstrual blood loss is well recognized as a major cause of iron-deficiency anemia in fertile women, it is not so well known that chronic iron deficiency can be a cause of menorrhagia. Taymor et al. have made such a suggestion on the basis of several observations16: • Response to iron supplementation alone in 74 of 83 patients (in whom organic disease had been excluded) • High rate of organic disease (fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, etc.) in the patients with no response to iron supplementation • Associated rise in serum iron levels in 44 of 57 patients • Decreased response to iron therapy when initial serum iron levels were high • Correlation of menorrhagia with depleted tissue iron stores (bone marrow) irrespective of serum iron level • A significant double-blind, placebo-controlled study displaying improvement in 75% of those given iron supplementation com- pared with 32.5% of those given the placebo Hematological screening and serum ferritin determination (the first parameter to indicate decreased iron levels) should be performed for patients complaining of menorrhagia. In one study, women who were menorrhagic (according to subjective information) displayed Membrane phospholipids Arachidonic acid COX1/2NSAIDs PGG 2 PGE 2 PGF 2α PGH 2 PGITXA –

significantly lower serum ferritin levels than controls, but hemoglo- bin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were not significantly different between the two groups.17 (The investigators in this study erroneously stated that such women do not require prophylactic iron supplementation because no hematolog- ical abnormalities appeared despite significantly reduced iron stores.) Iron supplementation, at a daily dose of 100 mg of elemental iron, has been recommended as a prophylactic therapy by several researchers because chronic iron deficiency appears to promote menorrhagia, and iron-containing enzymes are depleted before hematological changes are observed.18 A decreased serum ferritin level is a good indication of the need for iron supplementation.


In one study, serum retinol levels were found to be significantly lower in women with menorrhagia than in healthy controls.19 In this study, vitamin A was used as a treatment in 40 women diagnosed as having menorrhagia due to several different causes. In the group that received 60,000 IU of vitamin A for 35 days, menstruation returned to normal in 23 patients (57.5%) and was reduced in 14 (35%).19 Overall, the vitamin A was ineffective in only 3 of the 40 women (7.5%), and 92.5% of the 37 women had either complete relief or significant improve- ment.19 Although potentially effective, this therapy should not be used in women with the potential of pregnancy.

## Vitamin C and Bioflavonoids

Capillary fragility is believed to play a role in many cases of menorrha- gia. Supplementation with vitamin C (200 mg three times daily) and bioflavonoids (dose not specified) was shown to reduce menorrhagia in 14 of 16 patients.20 One of the patients with no response had endo- metriosis, and the other had metrorrhagia. Bioflavonoids, like vita- min C, can help strengthen the walls of capillaries. Bioflavonoids may also reduce heavy bleeding through their anti-inflammatory effect. A natural anti-inflammatory such as a bioflavonoid may be used to reduce heavy bleeding, just as conventional medicine uses nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Because vitamin C is known to significantly increase iron absorp- tion, its therapeutic effect could also be due to enhanced iron absorption.


One group of investigators has suggested that free radicals have a causative role in endometrial bleeding, particularly in the presence of an intrauterine device.21 Vitamin E supplementation (100 IU every days) resulted in improvement in all patients by the end of 10 weeks.22 Although vitamin E may have produced its effects via its antioxidant activity, it is equally plausible that the vitamin affected prostaglandin metabolism in a manner that reduced bleeding.

## Vitamin K and Chlorophyll

Although bleeding time and prothrombin levels in women with men- orrhagia are typically normal, the use of vitamin K (historically in the form of crude preparations of chlorophyll) has clinical and limited research support.23 Also, some women are found to have an inher- ited or acquired bleeding disorder. Table 197.2 lists some causes of acquired hemorrhagic disorders.23

<!-- chunk -->

## Essential Fatty Acids

Menorrhagia is associated with the increased availability of arachi- donic acid in the uterus.24 It now appears that the majority of tissue arachidonic acid is derived from the diet. It is therefore possible that by reducing the intake of animal products and/or increasing the intake of linoleic, linolenic, and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, blood loss could be curtailed by decreasing the availability of arachidonic acid. Consuming larger proportions of fish, nuts, and seeds can have an effect over time in altering the production of arachidonic acid. The use of fish oils, flax oil, and other seed oils as supplements may produce this favorable effect more quickly.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin B Complex

There may be a correlation between a nutritional deficiency of B vita- mins and menorrhagia. It has been shown that in vitamin B complex deficiency, the liver loses its ability to inactivate estrogen. Some cases of menorrhagia are due to an excess estrogen effect on the endome- trium. Therefore supplementing with a complex of B vitamins may normalize estrogen metabolism. A study conducted in the 1940s in a series of consecutive cases showed that a B-complex preparation led to “prompt” improvement in both menorrhagia and metrorrhagia.25 The preparations used were thiamin 3 to 9 mg, riboflavin 4.5 to 9 mg, and niacin up to 60 mg.25 IUDs can cause menorrhagia, especially within the first few months of insertion. A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was con- ducted on 126 women with increased bleeding occurring within month after insertion of a copper IUD (TCu380A). The participants were given a placebo (dried starch) or 100 mg of thiamin (vitamin B 1 ) for 3 months. Symptoms were tracked using the Higham scale. Benefit was seen after 1 month of vitamin B 1 usage and continued for the next 2 months. Improvement in length of menstrual bleeding, number of sanitary pads, and spotting were seen in the therapy group.26 This quantity of thiamine can easily be achieved in one to two B-complex capsules from a physician-grade nutraceutical company. If no benefit is shown, the patient may not be B-vitamin deficient.

## Zingiber Officinale (Ginger)

Ginger has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase, the enzyme believed to be related to the altered prostaglandin-2 ratio associated with excessive menstrual loss.27 The inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene formation could explain the traditional use of ginger as an anti-inflammatory agent. A placebo-controlled, randomized clinical study published in 2014 showed benefit of the use of ginger for heavy menstrual bleed- ing. The intervention group (n = 46) received 250 mg of ginger (dried rhizome, crushed and powdered) three times daily for 4 days (starting from the day before menses until the third day of menses) per month for 3 months. The bleeding amount was measured using

## Vitex Agnus Castus (Chaste Tree)

Chaste tree is probably the best-known herb in all of Europe for the treatment of hormonal imbalances and abnormal bleeding in women. Since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, chaste tree has been used for the full scope of menstrual disorders, including heavy menses. It is mainly the seeds that are used for medicine in Europe and the United States. Chaste tree acts on the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. It increases LH production and mildly inhibits the release of FSH. The result is a shift in the ratio of estrogen and progesterone that effectively becomes a progesterone-like action. Chaste tree has been studied and been shown to effect improvements in amenorrhea, polymenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, and menorrhagia.29–31 In a randomized, double-blinded, clinical controlled trial of women with IUD-induced bleeding, 42 women received Vitex (dosage not given), and the other 42 women received mefenamic acid (250 mg three times daily) for 8 days, starting with the first day of menses. The Vitex had slow improvement until the fourth month, where its efficacy was statistically similar to mefenamic acid, at 47.6% and 52% bleeding improvement, respectively.32 Chaste tree is the most important herb for normalizing the men- strual flow, but it is not a fast-acting herb. Its effects may not be known for 3 or 4 months.

## Pomegranate Flower

The Pomegranate tree, Punica granatum L., is found throughout India, Iran, and the Mediterranean regions, but over time, it has been culti- vated elsewhere in the world. All parts of the tree have medicinal value, with the fruit being the most well known. The flower was shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower glucose levels (in a rat study) and improve atherosclerosis and lipid profiles.33 Pomegranate has research showing benefit on bleeding disorders, such as excessive menstruation and gingivitis.34–36 In a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial on idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding, P. granatum flower was shown to be as effective as tranexamic acid. This was a small study, with each group having 38 women who finished the 3-month study. The dosages per cycle were as follows: tranexamic acid 500 mg every 6 hours for the first 5 days of the menstruation and 500 mg P. granatum every hours for the first 5 days of menstruation. Improvements in length of bleeding and quantity of blood loss were significant and comparable in both groups.34

## Myrtle Berry

Myrtus communis L. (Myrtaceae), myrtle berry, is native to the Mediterranean and Middle East. Its vast actions include anti- inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, antispas- modic, vasodilator, antiulcer, antioxidant, anticancer, anxiolytic, and sedative-hypnotic effects.37 The whole plant, when analyzed, contained the following chemical components: flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids, glycosides, and terpenoids.37 In 2014 a 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled pilot study was conducted on 30 women with abnormal uterine bleeding. The therapy group received 5 mL of myrtle berry syrup 30 minutes after each meal, three times daily (15 mL/d) for days, starting on day 1 of menstruation. The treatment group saw a significant reduction in menstrual duration (10.6 days to 8.2 days) and blood loss versus the placebo group. The treatment group also experienced significant beneficial changes in quality-of-life scores.38

## Traditional Astringent Herbs

Astringent herbs are used to reduce blood loss from the reproductive tract as well as the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and skin. The astringents most effective in uterine blood loss are often those that are high in tannins, although the tannins are most likely not the only constituent responsible. The following eight herbs are major astrin- gent and hemostatic agents used in chronic and acute menorrhagia. These herbs are usually used in combination formulations for weeks or months before they produce results. • Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) • Ladies’ mantle (Alchemilla vulgaris) • Cranesbill (Geranium maculatum) • Beth root (Trillium erectum) • Greater periwinkle (Vinca major) • Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) • Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) • Shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa pastoris) Shepherd’s purse has a long history of use in the management of obstetrical and gynecological hemorrhage.39 Intravenous and intramus- cular injections of this herb have been found to be effective (in uncon- trolled studies) in menorrhagia owing to functional abnormalities and fibroids.40,41 The hemostatic action of shepherd’s purse is believed to be due to its high concentration of oxalic and dicarboxylic acids.

## Traditional Uterine Tonics

Uterine tonics have enjoyed a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine for easing menstrual flow. Traditional and empiric views of uterine tonics hold that if the uterus is hypotonic, there may be heavy bleeding, and that improving uterine tone tends to normalize and reg- ulate menstrual bleeding. Uterine tonics or amphoterics that regulate tone and potentially reduce bleeding are as follows: • Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) • Helonia (Chamaelirium luteum) • Squaw vine (Mitchella repens) • Raspberry leaves (Rubus idaeus) • Life root (Senecio aureus) Astringent and uterine tonic herbs can be used in combination for- mulations or for weeks to months as teas, liquid extracts, or powders in capsules. These herbs must usually be taken in combination formu- lations for weeks or months to produce results.

## Traditional Herbs for Semiacute and Acute Blood Loss When

<!-- chunk -->

## the Patient is Stable

The traditional herbs listed here have dose-specific toxicities and should be used only after reference to a botanical reference text to ensure proper dosing. Cinnamon essential oil should be used at 1 to drops every 3 to 4 hours. The other herbs should not exceed 20 drops every 2 hours or 1 capsule every 4 hours. • Cinnamon essential oil (Cinnamomum verum) • Life root (S. aureus) • Canadian fleabane (Erigeron canadensis) • Greater periwinkle (V. major) • Shepherd’s purse (C. bursa pastorus) • Yarrow (A. millefolium) • Savin (Sabina officinalis) • Beth root (T. erectum) These botanicals should be used as the sole treatment only in women who are stable. In unstable patients, they should be used only as adjuncts to intravenous estrogens or other pharmaceutical or surgical interven- tions. They can be used in patients with chronic menorrhagia who are stable and for semiacute blood loss or acute blood loss if a patient shows no signs of instability and improves within 12 to 24 hours.

## Bioidentical Hormones

Estrogens and progestogens, including bioidentical estradiol and progesterone, can be extremely effective in managing menorrhagia, in the same way as conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) or synthetic estrogens and progestins are in conventional medicine. For control of an acute bleeding episode, the use of bioidentical estradiol should be just as effective as one of the dosing regimens of CEE. These hormones are prescription items and should be administered by a practitioner qualified to use them. Cyclic bioidentical progesterone can be used to correct recurring menorrhagia, and a short course of oral bioidentical progesterone can be used in many cases of acute menorrhagia. Bioidentical progesterone creams will not have as sig- nificant an effect as the higher-dose pills or oral micronized natural progesterone.


Patients who are unstable—as evidenced by hypotension, dizziness, loss of consciousness, chills or fever, or passage of large amounts of tissue—require transfer to a hospital for intravenous estrogens, D&C, and/or hysterectomy or uterine ablation. The first step in treating a woman with menorrhagia is to control the cause. When the excessive bleeding has been determined to be related to prothrombin time, hematological status, or thyroid function, such abnormalities can be corrected. Mechanical causes of menorrhagia may be managed without removal of the cause, such as an endometrial polyp or uterine fibroid. But if no improvement occurs, conventional treatment, including surgery, may be necessary. Endometrial hyper- plasia requires definitive and proven progesterone or progestin treat- ment with biopsy-proven improvement. Endometrial cancer requires a hysterectomy. Infections of the uterus must be treated appropriately. Ectopic pregnancy with or without bleeding necessitates immediate conventional intervention. In cases of chronic menorrhagia or episodic acute blood loss that is effectively managed, a CBC and serum ferritin measurement can be used to help monitor the patient’s anemia status.


The diet should be relatively low in sources of arachidonic acid (animal fats), high in fish oils (docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids), and high in linolenic and linoleic acids (vegetable oil sources). Green leafy vegetables and other sources of vitamin K should be eaten freely. Fruits, vegetables, and spices with anti-inflammatory effects include garlic, onions, cumin, pineapple, and citrus.


• High-potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula • Vitamin C: 1 g three times per day with meals • Vitamin A (retinol) 60,000 IU (18,000 mcg) daily for 35 days. Avoid pregnancy with this treatment • Bioflavonoids (mixed from citrus): 1000 mg/day • Chlorophyll: 25 mg/day (use a crude form) or 1 mg vitamin K 1 If low serum ferritin is confirmed: • Iron: 30 mg, bound to either pyrophosphate, succinate, glycinate, or fumarate, twice a day between meals (if this recommendation results in abdominal discomfort, take 30 mg with meals three times a day)


For chronic recurring menorrhagia: • V. agnus castus (chaste berry): The usual dosage of chaste berry extract (often standardized to contain 0.5 % agnuside) in tablet or capsule form is 175 to 225 mg/day. If using the liquid extract, the typical dosage is 2 to 4 mL (approximately ½–1 tsp)/day. For semiacute cases, the following botanicals should be given: • Ginger 250 mg (powdered rhizome) three times daily for 4 days. Start the day before menses and continue until the third day of menses. • Botanical tincture of equal parts of each herb (20–30 drops every 2–3 hours): yarrow, greater periwinkle, shepherd’s purse, life root • Cinnamon oil: 1 to 5 drops every 3 to 4 hours

<!-- chunk -->

## Bioidentical Hormones

• Oral micronized progesterone: 100 mg twice a day given in the luteal phase for 12 days per month for recurring menorrhagia; to 400 mg per day for 7 to 12 days may be used for semiacute blood loss, followed by a cyclic hormone product for 21 days on and days off. • Oral micronized progesterone for semiacute blood loss: 200 to 400 mg per day for 7 to 12 days, followed by a cyclic hormone pro- gram for 21 days on and 7 days off. • Progesterone cream (a product that contains at least 400 mg of pro- gesterone per ounce): ¼ to ½ tsp twice a day for 12 days per month during the luteal phase for cases of mild recurring menorrhagia. • Bioidentical estradiol: High-dose regimen for acute bleeding is as follows: 4 mg estradiol every 4 hours for 24 hours, then a single daily dose of 1 mg for 7 to 10 days, followed by oral micronized progesterone 200 mg before bed for 7 to 12 days.

Increasing evidence suggests that CSD may play a role in migraine pathophysiology and overall cerebral hyperexcitability. In addition, triggering CSD can require activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which augments depolarization.13 In one study, CSD was prevented in the presence of ifenprodil, a selective NMDA receptor antagonist.14 NMDA receptor antagonist therapy is suggested to be a potentially novel therapeutic approach.15 The anticonvulsant topiramate has become a first-line treatment for migraine; its efficacy as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist and glutamate antag- onist supports the concept of excessive cerebral excitability as related to NMDA-receptor activation.16 Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), among the most potent vasodilators known, is found to be elevated after migraine. CGRP antagonists have been demonstrated to be effective in relieving migraine pain without causing vasoconstriction and are being investigated for their therapeutic efficacy and safety.17 Evidence indicates that patients with migraine have a functional abnormality of vasomotor control. Migraineurs suffer from syncope and orthostatic intolerance more often than patients who do not have migraine (who are without clear interictal signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction)18; they also seem to be abnormally sensitive to the vasodilatory effects of physical and chemical agents. Migraine also has complex relations with disorders of the cerebro- vascular system, the cardiovascular system, and the heart. Right-to-left shunt, patent foramen ovale, and mitral valve prolapse are all associated with a higher prevalence of migraine headache. Migraine with aura has also been shown to be associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk factors (ratio of total cholesterol to high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol >5, hypertension, and history of early-onset coronary heart disease or stroke), as well as an increase in both all-cause and cardiovascular mor- tality.19,20 Although the risk for stroke is highest among young women who have migraine with aura, particularly if they smoke or use oral contraceptives, studies suggest that male and female migraineurs are at increased risk for ischemic stroke regardless of age.21 It is additionally worth noting that migraine and epilepsy are comorbid disorders that share common physiological mechanisms and treatments.22

## Platelets and Serotonin

Serotonin is normally stored in platelets and released by platelet aggre- gation and in response to various stimuli, such as catecholamines. There is no difference in total serotonin content between normal plate- lets and the platelets of patients with migraine. However, the quantity of serotonin released by the platelets of the patient with migraine in response to serotonin stimulation, although normal or even subnor- mal immediately after an attack, becomes progressively higher as the next attack approaches.23 The rise of plasma serotonin may not be causative in migraine but could represent a self-defense mechanism.7 Platelet activation has been observed in electron micrographs during migraine, which may be a result of the neurogenic inflammation.8 A genetic predisposition to altered serotonin functionality in migraine has also emerged; for example, a polymorphism with a variable num- ber of tandem repeats in a region of the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) has been implicated. The variant with more repeats and greater expression has been found by meta-analysis to increase the risk for migraine by 34% to 55% among heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively.24 Furthermore, SERT proteins expressed by platelets are identical to those expressed in the brain. It is worth noting, on the other hand, that platelet deactivating agents—such as aspirin, feverfew, and essential fatty acids—appear to be effective in migraine prevention. Biochemical studies have shown that serotonin is a stress-response system that involves increased turnover during both acute and longer-term stress.25 The connection between serotonin and headaches began in the 1960s when researchers found that there was an increase in the sero- tonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the urine during a migraine.26 Initially, serotonin excess was implicated; how- ever, newer information indicates that the factor responsible for the increase in 5-HIAA is more likely the increased breakdown of serotonin as a result of the increased activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO).27,28 Because migraineurs appear to have low levels of serotonin in their tissues, researchers began to refer to migraine as a “low-serotonin syn- drome.”28 Low serotonin levels are thought to lead to a decrease in NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION PRO-INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES CAUSE VASODILATION MAST CELL ALTERS TRIGEMNOVASCULAR MICROENVIRONMENT PRO-INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES CAUSE NEURONAL ACTIVATION NEURONAL ACTIVATIONVASODILATION MECHANICAL ACTIVATION OF NEURON VASCULAR PERMEABILITY NEURON ACTIVATION RELEASE OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS/ NEUROPEPTIDES INCREASE IN VASODILATION Fig. 198.1 Model of vascular-neural coupling. Mast cell activation and degranulation alter the trigeminovas- cular microenvironment via the release of inflammatory molecules. Inflammatory molecules can mediate the vasodilation of nearby vessels and cause nociceptor activation. These vessels can activate trigeminal neurons mechanically or by the release of inflammatory mediators due to increased vascular permeability, causing a positive feedback loop.

the pain threshold in patients with chronic headaches. This contention is strongly supported by over 35 years of research, including positive clinical results in double-blind studies with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Current understanding indicates that a low-serotonin state facilitates activation of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathway, as induced by CSD.29 For more information on the clinical studies with 5-HTP in migraine headaches, see Chapter 87. The triptan family of drugs includes the 5HT 1b and 5HT 1d recep- tor agonists. These agents constrict blood vessels, block neurogenic inflammation and neural peptide release, and may also inhibit neu- ronal activity within the trigeminovascular system.30–32 The safety of these agents has been questioned because the triptans activate sero- tonin receptors on cerebral vessels and, to a lesser extent, coronary arteries. The chest pain that is reported by 3% to 5% of patients tak- ing oral triptans has generally not been associated with electrocardio- graphic changes and does not appear to be due to cardiac ischemia.33 However, triptans should be avoided in patients with ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease.1 It is generally advisable to avoid the use of triptans, ergotamine-based drugs, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) simultane- ously, although the risk of serotonin syndrome appears to be low.33 Extreme caution is advised in considering the use of an SSRI along with 5-HTP. Although SSRIs are sometimes used for migraine prophylaxis, the scientific effect is unknown, the quality of evidence is poor, and the impression of clinical effect is low.25,34,35

## Neuronal Disorder

It has been suggested that the trigeminovascular neurons, which innervate the pial arteries, release calcitonin gene–related peptide and the peptide substance P, either directly from various cellular sig- nals or secondarily to CNS activation.36 Substance P is a key pain mediator, and its release into the arteries is associated with vasodi- lation, mast cell degranulation, and increased vascular permeability. It is believed that the endothelial cells of the arteries respond to sub- stance P and CGRP by releasing vasoactive substances such as arachi- donic acid metabolites, purine compounds, or molecules containing carbonyl groups. This theory suggests that functional changes within the noradrenergic system constitute the threshold for migraine acti- vation, and it is through modulation of sympathetic activity that potentiators exert their effects.36 Chronic stress is a chief potentiator in this model.

## Unified Hypothesis

The mechanism of migraine can be described as a three-stage process: initiation, prodrome, and headache. Although a particular stressor may be associated with the onset of a specific attack, it appears that the initiation is dependent on the accumulation over time of several stressors. These stressors ultimately affect serotonin metabolism (Box 198.1). Once a critical threshold of susceptibility is reached, a cascade of events is initiated. This susceptibility is probably based on a com- bination of decreased tissue serotonin levels; platelet modulation; alteration in the responsiveness of key cerebrovascular end organs; increased sensitivity of the intrinsic noradrenergic system of the brain; and the accumulation of histamine, arachidonic acid metabolites, or other mediators of inflammation. The platelet changes include increased adhesiveness, enhanced tendency to release serotonin, and increased levels of arachidonic acid in the membranes. Once platelets are stimulated to secrete serotonin, sequelae, including platelet aggre- gation, vasospasm, and inflammatory processes, lead to local cerebral ischemia. This is followed by rebound vasodilation and the release of peptide substance P and other mediators of pain. These events are summarized in Fig 198.2.

## Conventional Treatments

Pharmacological treatment of migraine headache tends to be inadequate because it fails to address the underlying cause. Modern first-line phar- maceuticals for prophylaxis in adults include propranolol, valproic acid, and topiramate, but a host of other drugs can be helpful for migraine prevention. In 2018 the first CGRP-related therapies were approved, including Erenumab, a CGRP inhibitor. The initial results are encour- aging in terms of both efficacy and safety, but long-term data are needed because these therapies carry a potential risk for neovascularization- related adverse effects, such as delay in recovery from ischemia and the healing of wounds and ulcers.37,38 Despite their effectiveness, some pre- ventive drugs can exacerbate other conditions. Flunarizine (unavailable in the United States), valproate, and amitriptyline, for example, should be used with caution or avoided in obese patients because they tend to cause weight gain. Amitriptyline and pizotifen can worsen glaucoma and urinary retention. Beta blockers can exacerbate asthma and diabetes, and topiramate can enhance the risk of renal calculi.39 Most guidelines from European countries include a nondrug treatment section, which also includes behavioral and psychological techniques.40 Medications are considered efficacious if they reduce migraine frequency by at least 50%.41 This is an important consideration where nonpharmacological treatment options are concerned. The first step in treating migraine headache is to identify the precipitating factor or factors. Although food intolerance/allergy is important, many other factors must be considered as either primary causes or contributors to the migraine process. In par- ticular, it is very important to assess the role that headache medications may be playing, particularly in chronic headaches.

headache, deserves mention because it frequently precludes the success- ful treatment of the underlying primary headache disorder, most often migraine or tension-type headache. In some cases, MOH may be associ- ated with the development or maintenance of a chronic daily headache syndrome.42 After successful MOH treatment, preventive medications for the underlying primary headache disorder have a greater chance of success. Patients who were able to discontinue their daily use of symp- tom-modifying medications experienced improvement in their chronic headaches in addition to greater efficacy of their prophylactic medica- tions.43 All drugs used for symptomatic relief on a regular basis can pro- duce MOH, although the precise mechanism of action is unknown.44 Central sensitization, changes in trigeminal pain processing, receptor downregulation, and biobehavioral factors have all been proposed as possibly leading to MOH. Drugs that carry the highest potential for causing MOH include opioids, butalbital-containing analgesics, and aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine combinations. Triptans carry inter- mediate to high potential for causing MOH when used frequently, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) carry the lowest risk.45 Ergotamine can cause MOH in addition to other symptoms when taken regularly. Regular use of ergotamine in migraine can result in a dependency cycle in which headaches escalate in severity on cessation of the medication. Ergotamine withdrawal predictably causes debilitat- ing headaches, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, generally resulting in an improved status by 72 hours. Ginger preparations can be helpful during ergotamine withdrawal. MOH should be suspected in any patient with chronic headaches who is taking large or regular quantities of analgesics and who is expe- riencing daily predictable headache. Any medication used regularly for headache pain could be a causative agent and hence should be elimi- nated (opiates, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines must be withdrawn slowly, but NSAIDs, triptans, ergot alkaloids, and acetaminophen may be stopped abruptly). Although the logic may seem counterintuitive to patients, they may be pleasantly surprised by a sizable improvement in outcome. For those having trouble tolerating the transition, acupunc- ture may be offered. Agents that are sometimes used during the tran- sition when medications are unavoidable include metoclopramide, dihydroergotamine mesylate, naproxen sodium, and prednisone.

## Food Allergy/Intolerance

Food allergy/intolerance can play an important role in many cases of migraine headache. Double-blind placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that the detection and removal of antigenic/intolerable foods will eliminate or greatly reduce migraine symptoms in the major- ity of patients. What is unclear is the percentage of migraine patients for whom food control is the most important factor. Table 198.1 sum- marizes the results of several clinical studies. Success ranges from 30% to 93%, with the majority of studies showing a remarkably high degree of success.46–53 A plausible explanation for the large difference between the results of Mansfield et al.46 and the others47–53 is that the Mansfield design was carefully selected for food allergy only, whereas the others included food intolerance. These studies found the incidence of food allergy to be similar among the major types of migraine. Few studies have been performed since the 1980s, when much of the groundwork regarding the relationship between food intolerance and migraine was laid. The foods most commonly found to induce migraine headaches are listed in Table 198.2. The mechanism by which food allergy/intolerance induces a migraine attack is still unknown. Several theories have been proposed: • Idiopathic response to a pharmacologically active substance, such as tyramine • Monoamine oxidase deficiency • Platelet phenolsulfotransferase deficiency; immunologically medi- ated food allergy • Platelet abnormalities Egger et al.49 suggested that migraine headache may occur through chronic activation of the nonspecific responsiveness of cerebrovas- cular end organs as a result of long-term antigenic stimulation. This mechanism would be analogous to the bronchiolar response in asthma Dietary amines Food allergy Stressors Catecholamine release Platelet serotonin release Platelet aggregation Sterile neurogenic inflammation Rebound vasodilitation Release of substance P and other mediators of inflammation Vasoconstriction Local cerebral ischemia InitiationProdromeHeadache

to exercise or cold after antigen contact. Allergic reactions to foods are known to cause platelet degranulation, with resultant serotonin release.52 In children, common migraine triggers include cheese, chocolate, citrus fruits, hot dogs, monosodium glutamate, aspartame, fatty foods, ice cream, and caffeine withdrawal. Among adolescents, alcoholic drinks, especially red wine and beer, may also be a trigger. Tyramine, phenylethylamine, histamine, nitrites, and sulfites are involved in the mechanism of food intolerance headache, whereas immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy is an infrequent cause.54 Several methods may be used to detect food allergies; most of these are described in Chapter 14. Laboratory testing can be convenient, but one major drawback of food intolerance testing with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can be a lack of reproducible findings with split blood samples among various laboratories. However, a study pub- lished in Mexico in 2007 found that when migraineurs removed foods to which they had mounted IgG responses, they experienced a robust improvement in their migraines, with 43 of 65 patients showing com- plete remission after 1 month of specific food elimination.55 In 2010 a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial found a statistically signifi- cant reduction in headache days and migraine attacks after following an IgG-based elimination diet. Interestingly, the average number of foods with a high titer was 24 out of 266 tested.56 Patients with both migraine and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following an IgG-guided elimination diet also found significant improvement for both condi- tions when randomized and double-blinded.57 Elimination diets/challenge testing are reliable and experiential methods for detecting food intolerance, but they also have limitations: some foods evoke a delayed response, so it may require several days of repeated challenge to elicit recognizable symptoms. Food triggers can also be inconsistent. The ingestion of large amounts of several foods may be necessary to detect those that are marginally reactive. The recommended procedure for the diagnosis and management of food allergy/intolerance is described in the section “Therapeutic Approach.”

## Dietary Amines

Foods such as chocolate, aged cheese, pickled herring, sausages, sour cream, fermented foods, beer, and wine may precipitate migraine attacks because they contain histamine and/or other vasoactive compounds such as phenylethylamine that have a vasodilatory effect (Box 198.2).53,58,59 Tyramine is a component of many of these foods and has long been regarded as an important migraine trigger, but controlled studies have yielded conflicting findings.60 Red wine is more likely than white wine to trigger a headache because it contains 20 to 200 times the amount of histamine and stimulates the release of vasoactive compounds by platelets.23,58,61 Red wine is additionally much higher in flavonoids, the antioxidant components shown to help prevent heart disease. These compounds can also inhibit the enzyme phenol sulfotransferase, which normally breaks down serotonin and other vasoactive amines in platelets. Many migraineurs have been found to have significantly lower levels of this enzyme,60 although the implications are confusing. Because red wine contains substances that are potent inhibitors of this enzyme, it often triggers migraines in these individuals, especially if consumed along with foods high in high vasoactive amine content, like cheese or

chocolate. A standard treatment for histamine-induced headaches is to use a histamine-free diet along with vitamin B 6 supplementation.61,62 The activity of the enzyme diamine oxidase, which breaks down histamine in the lining of the small intestine before it is absorbed into the circulation, appears to play a key role in determining reactivity to dietary histamine. Individuals sensitive to dietary histamine have lower levels (about 50%) of this enzyme in their tissues compared with con- trol subjects.58 Diamine oxidase is a vitamin B 6 –dependent enzyme. Not surprisingly, compounds that antagonize vitamin B 6 also inhibit diamine oxidase.58 These inhibitory factors include food coloring agents (specifically the hydrazine dyes, such as FD&C yellow #5), some drugs (isoniazid, hydralazine, dopamine, and penicillamine), oral con- traceptives, alcohol, and excessive protein intake. Vitamin B 6 supplementation (usually 1 mg/kg) has been shown to improve histamine tolerance, presumably by increasing diamine oxi- dase activity.58,62 Women have lower levels of diamine oxidase, which may explain the higher incidence of histamine-induced headaches among them. Women are also much more frequently unable to tol- erate red wine. Interestingly, the level of diamine oxidase in a woman increases by over 500 times during pregnancy.63,64 It is very common for women with histamine-induced headaches to experience complete remission of their headaches during pregnancy.

## Miscellaneous Diet-Related Triggers

Hypoglycemia can be a trigger for migraine headache65,66 and is mod- ifiable by dietary manipulation. Glycemic dysregulation is common in the setting of the standard American diet, given a tendency to con- sume unregulated quantities of high-glycemic-index carbohydrates. Hypoglycemia may be a result of inappropriate carbohydrate intake, especially when insulin levels become elevated. In 2018 a randomized trial found that a low-glycemic-index diet had a similar effectiveness to medications for migraine prophylaxis in terms of migraine frequency reduction, although a longer period was required for an effect (90 days vs. 30 days).67 Excessive sodium intake may also represent a migraine trigger,68 perhaps because of increasing angiotensin levels in response to sodium ingestion. In a randomized trial, a low-lipid diet (<20% of energy from lipids) has also proven effective for reducing the number and severity of headaches over a 1-year period compared with a typical lipid diet. It is speculated that a higher-lipid diet may trigger a greater degree of platelet aggregation and, consequently, an increase in sero- tonin release.69 For individuals who are lactose-intolerant, avoidance of dairy products may afford improvement in the experience of migraine headache.70 Aspartame, a common sweetener, may be associated with an increased likelihood of migraine incidence71,72 and is easily avoided. Sucralose has become another commonly used artificial sweetener and may be a migraine trigger.73 Monosodium glutamate is a well-recognized migraine trigger that can directly activate the NMDA receptor.

## Helicobacter pylori

Gasbarrini et al.74 demonstrated that migraine headaches improved dramatically in 100% of patients for whom Helicobacter pylori was identified and treated through standard measures. Further research has shown that the prevalence of H. pylori infection is significantly higher in migraineurs without aura compared with controls, indicat- ing that H. pylori infection is a probable independent environmental risk factor for migraine without aura, especially in patients who are not genetically or hormonally susceptible.75 It appears that inciden- tal H. pylori positivity is more relevant in migraineurs compared with controls because a high percentage experienced relief from migraines when the infection was eradicated.76

## 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)

5-HTP, the molecular intermediate between tryptophan and sero- tonin, is readily absorbed when taken orally and easily crosses the blood–brain barrier. In addition to augmenting serotonin levels, it may also increase endorphin levels. The use of 5-HTP in the preven- tion of migraine headache offers considerable advantages over drug therapy. Although a number of drugs have been shown to be use- ful in the prevention of migraine headache, all of the currently used drugs carry with them a risk of significant adverse effects. 5-HTP is at least as effective as other pharmacological agents used in the prevention of migraine headaches and is safer and better tolerated. Although some studies have employed a dosage of 600 mg/day or more,77 5-HTP can be effective at a dosage as low as 200 mg/day.78 The clinical studies with 5-HTP in migraine headaches are discussed in Chapter 87.

## Essential Fatty Acids

The role of essential fatty acids (EFAs) in the pathogenesis of migraine may be quite important but does not appear to have received much research attention. Considering the significance of platelet aggrega- tion and arachidonic acid metabolites in the mediation of the events leading to the cerebral ischemia of migraine, manipulation of dietary EFAs may be very useful. The therapeutic efficacy of EFA manipulation was demonstrated in a 2013 clinical trial; a high–omega-3 and low– omega-6 diet (H3-L6) significantly reduced pain and increased quality of life among participants with chronic headache (97% of whom had migraine or migraine-like symptoms). This was more effective than lowering only the omega-6 component of the diet, with a proposed mechanism of action mediated via antinociceptive omega-3–derived mediators, including resolvins D2 and E1, known to stimulate the res- olution of inflammation.79 It has been demonstrated that reducing the consumption of ani- mal fats and increasing the consumption of fish will significantly modify platelet and membrane EFA ratios and decrease platelet aggre- gation.80–82 It is also noteworthy that 60% of the brain is composed of lipids; therefore appropriate consumption of the essential fats is mandatory for proper neurological function. In two small place- bo-controlled studies,83,84 omega-3 fatty acids performed significantly better than placebo in reducing headache frequency and intensity. A small, randomized, double-blind crossover study of 27 adolescents with migraine revealed marked improvement in migraine headache frequency, duration, and severity with fish oil, but patients were noted to respond equally well to olive oil supplements, the chosen placebo for this study.85 In 2018 a systematic review and meta-analysis of random- ized controlled trials was published; this analysis did not find benefit for reducing headache frequency, but it did find a significant reduc- tion of approximately 3.5 hours in migraine duration.86 The proposed mechanisms of action of the omega-3 fatty acids include reduced plate- let serotonin release, modulation of prostaglandin synthesis, and dim- inution of cerebral vasospasm. Bic et al. proposed that free fatty acids are an important under- lying factor in the development of migraine headache because ele- vated blood lipids and free fatty acids are associated with increased platelet aggregability, decreased 5-HT, and increased prostaglandin levels, all of which may play a role in migraine.87 They list biological states that produce increased free fatty acids and lipids, including high dietary fat intake, obesity, insulin resistance, vigorous exercise, hunger, consumption of alcohol and caffeine, oral contraceptive use, tobacco abuse, and stress. These variables may be manipulated successfully through lifestyle practices, diet, and pharmacological measures.

## Riboflavin (Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 2


A deficit of mitochondrial energy metabolism may play a role in migraine pathogenesis.88 Riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) is a precursor of flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, which are required for the activity of flavoenzymes involved in the electron transport chain. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study demonstrated that a daily oral dose of 400 mg of riboflavin was superior to placebo for migraine prophylaxis. The effect began at month, with maximal effect after 3 months of therapy. At that point, 59% of those taking riboflavin were considered responders versus only 15% of those taking a placebo.89 The hypothesis that vitamin B 2 bene- fits migraine by increasing complex I and II activity in mitochondrial energy metabolism can be tested by nuclear magnetic resonance spec- troscopy.89,90 Vitamin B 2 appears to improve mitochondrial function without changing neuronal excitability, which could explain the excel- lent tolerance and lack of CNS adverse effects. In addition to improving mitochondrial function, riboflavin has other mechanisms for reducing neurotoxicity, including protection against glutamate excitotoxicity and neurogenic inflammation (Fig. 198.3). Diarrhea and polyuria may be associated with the administration of high-dose vitamin B 2 .74 It is notable that riboflavin is well tolerated, is less expensive than typical migraine-targeted medications, and may provide protection from oxi- dative toxicity in the brain, making it an excellent therapeutic option.91 In a study of riboflavin prophylaxis for pediatric and adolescent migraine, 200 mg/day was an adequate dose, and although it took months to achieve optimal results, nearly 70% reported a 50% or greater reduction in migraine frequency as well as a decrease in intensity.92 Another study suggested a lack of efficacy for riboflavin in children, but the inclusion and exclusion criteria were acknowledged to be very strict.93 It has also been found that 100 mg per day may be inadequate, whereas 200 mg per day effectively reduces headache frequency among children.94 An intriguing study was done in 2000 that compared riboflavin with beta-blocker therapy. Although both groups had a sizeable num- ber of “responders” (53% and 55% had a reduction in frequency of more than 50%), they appeared to work via different mechanisms, as the beta-blocker group had reduced intensity of auditory-invoked cor- tical potentials that was directly proportional to the clinical response. Given that riboflavin did not alter cortical potentials, it suggests that these therapies may have value when used together or as viable alterna- tives to nonresponders to either therapy.95 Lastly, mitochondrial DNA mutations may influence the clinical effect of riboflavin. In a trial com- paring those with haplogroup H versus non-H, 44.8% compared with 77% responded to riboflavin supplementation, further supporting the hypothesis that riboflavin helps correct underlying mitochondrial pathology.96

## Other B Vitamins

Other B vitamins, including folic acid, may also be instrumental in aborting or preventing migraine headache.97 There may also be a genetic influence on the effectiveness of other B vitamins as well. For example, elevated homocysteine levels have been associated with a two- to nearly sixfold increase in the risk for migraine with aura, in part determined by polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofo- late reductase (MTHFR) gene, and dietary folate has been found to be inversely related to migraine disability, also influenced by MTHFR genotype (Fig. 198.4 shows the influence of B vitamins on homocys- teine toxicity).98,99 Several randomized trials have now been published documenting both a reduction in homocysteine (in response to B 6 , B 12 , and folic acid supplementation) as well as reductions in migraine fre- quency and severity, in part influenced by MTHFR and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) polymorphisms. Given that those with the underactive MTHFR genotype are less responsive, this suggests that a Oxidative Stress Neurogenic Inflammation Mitochondrial Dysfunction Homocysteine Neurotoxicity

Riboflavin protects against neurotoxicity by ameliorating oxida- tive stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurogenic inflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, and homocysteine neurotoxicity. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurogenic inflammation, glutamate excitotoxic- ity, and homocysteine neurotoxicity are involved in neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity. Also, those neuro- toxic factors have the ability to cause each other, leading to the formation of a neurotoxic cycle. Riboflavin is capable of attacking this proposed neurotoxic cycle via multiple neuroprotective mechanisms that tackle different neurotoxic factors in this cycle. (From Marashly ET, Bohlega SA.

## Coenzyme Q

## 10

Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ) is a critical component of the electron trans- port chain and functions as an important antioxidant. Evidence supports the administration of CoQ 10 in reducing the frequency of migraines by 61%.104 After 3 months of receiving 150 mg of CoQ 10 at breakfast, the average number of headache days decreased from seven to three per month in 31 adults who completed an open-label study. A double-blind, randomized study of 42 adult patients, using 100 mg of water-soluble CoQ 10 three times daily, revealed similar results.105 More recently, CoQ 10 was given at 400 mg per day to women with episodic migraine in a randomized and double-blinded trial. This high dose not only significantly improved the severity, frequency, and duration of migraine, but it also reduced CGRP and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ) significantly (although not interleukin-6 [IL-6] or interleukin- 10 [IL-10]), suggesting another possible mechanism of action.106 CoQ 10 deficiency appears to be common in the pediatric and ado- lescent populations and can be an important therapeutic consider- ation in these age groups.107 Like riboflavin, CoQ 10 is well tolerated (although expensive), with little risk of toxicity. It is ideal for women of childbearing age and for children because of its excellent tolerability. Liquid gel formulations should be favored for their high bioavailabil- ity. CoQ 10 must be used with caution in patients who also take warfa- rin because it may antagonize the anticoagulation effects of warfarin. It is also noteworthy that many medications can interfere with CoQ 10 activity, including statins, beta blockers, and certain antidepressants and antipsychotics.108


The high frequency of magnesium deficiency is well established. Magnesium is the least abundant serum electrolyte and the second most abundant intracellular cation; it is integral to the metabolism of calcium, potassium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, iron, sodium, lead, cal- cium, hydrochloric acid, acetylcholine, nitric oxide, and many enzymes. Magnesium absorption depends on dietary adequacy, selenium, para- thyroid hormone, and vitamins B 6 and D. Absorption is hindered by excess fat. Magnesium levels are depleted by a multitude of common factors, including stress, excess alcohol intake, high estrogen levels, low progesterone, dietary excesses, certain drugs, hyperthyroidism, and hyperparathyroidism. Inadequate dietary intake of magnesium is likely in 75% of the U.S. population,109 and it is believed to be the most common micronutrient deficiency, manifested by a diverse range of associated pathologies.110 Physiological and psychological stress results in magnesium depletion, and both acute and chronic stress are associ- ated with increased episodes of migraine. Substantial documentation linking low magnesium levels to both migraine and tension headaches exists in the medical literature.111–113 Low brain and tissue magnesium concentrations have been found in patients with migraine, indicating a need for supplementation. Among magnesium’s central functions are to maintain vascular tone and prevent neuronal hyperexcitation.111–114 Cerebrospinal fluid levels of magnesium have been found to be low in migraine, and low magne- sium levels can predispose to several physiological dysfunctions known to be prominent in migraine. These include induction of cerebral vaso- spasm; potentiation of the contractile response of blood vessels to vaso- active substances such as serotonin; enhancement of the sensitivity of NMDA receptors to glutamate; and an increase in platelet aggregation, leading to serotonin release.115 Magnesium deficiency may play an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine by promoting CSD.73 Two notable double-blind studies have provided conflicting results on the prevention of migraines in people prone to recurrent migraine headaches. In the first study, 250 mg of magnesium or placebo was given twice daily to 69 patients (35 received magnesium, and received placebo) for 12 weeks.116 The number of responders was 10 in each group (28.6% with magnesium and 29.4% with placebo). There was no benefit with magnesium compared with placebo with respect to migraine frequency or intensity. In the other double-blind study, patients experiencing recurrent migraines were given either 600 mg of oral magnesium daily for 12 weeks or placebo.115,117 By the ninth week, the frequency of attacks was reduced by 41.6% in the magne- sium group, compared with only 15.8% in the placebo group. Drug consumption for symptomatic treatment per patient also decreased significantly in the magnesium group. In a study that sought to deter- mine magnesium efficacy specifically in migraineurs without aura, 600 mg of magnesium citrate daily produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with placebo and also produced an improvement in cortical blood flow.118 It appears that magnesium supplementation may specifically be effective in those individuals with low tissue or low ionized levels of magnesium. Low tissue levels of magnesium are common in patients with migraine, but most cases go unnoticed because physicians gen- erally rely on serum magnesium levels to assess magnesium status. Because most of the body’s magnesium is intracellular, serum lev- els are unreliable indicators. A low magnesium level in the serum reflects late-stage deficiency. More sensitive tests of magnesium sta- tus include erythrocyte magnesium levels or ionized magnesium, the ↓ MTHFR↓ Folic acid↓ Vitamin B 12 ↓ Vitamin B 6 ↓ MTRR ↑ Homocysteine ROS Endothelial dysfunction Direct celluar damage Migraine Platelet activation Impaired biosynthesis of methionine

most physiologically active form. This latter indicator has been found to indicate magnesium deficiency much more commonly during men- strual migraines than at other times, suggesting a potential therapeutic value of magnesium for these headaches.119 Hypothetically, patients with an acute migraine episode and low serum levels (<0.54 mmol/L) of ionized magnesium are more likely to respond to an intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) than patients with higher levels of ionized magnesium in serum; this hypothesis has been tested.120,121 Serum samples to determine levels of ionized magnesium were drawn immediately before infusion of 1 g of MgSO 4 in 40 patients with acute migraine headache. Pain reduction of 50% or more, as measured on a verbal pain intensity scale of 1 to 10, occurred within 15 minutes of infusion in 35 patients. In 21 patients, at least this degree of improvement or complete relief persisted for hours or more. Pain relief lasted at least 24 hours in 18 of 21 patients (86%) with serum ionized magnesium levels below 0.54 mmol/L and in 3 of 19 patients (16%) with ionized magnesium levels at or above 0.54 mmol/L. The average ionized magnesium level in patients with relief lasting for at least 24 hours was initially significantly lower than that in patients with no relief or only fleeting relief. Intravenous magnesium has been shown to be an extremely effec- tive treatment in some cases of acute migraine, tension, and cluster headaches. A dosage of 1 to 3 g of intravenous magnesium (over a 10-minute period) generally results in a nearly 90% success rate in patients with low ionized magnesium levels.120–123 Patients treated with MgSO 4 typically observe complete elimination of migraine-as- sociated symptoms such as nausea, photosensitivity, and phonosen- sitivity. Adverse effects are rare, with the exception of a brief flushed feeling. Indeed, a 2016 meta-analysis of 21 randomized trials found that intravenous magnesium relieved acute migraines within 15 to minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours after infusion (odds ratios [ORs] = 0.23, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively). Additionally, oral magnesium sig- nificantly alleviated the frequency and intensity of migraine (ORs = 0.20 and 0.27), highlighting the important role of this mineral for both acute treatment and prophylaxis.124 Another possible benefit of magnesium in migraineurs may be its ability to improve mitral valve prolapse, which is linked to migraines because it causes mechanical damage to platelets, promoting their release of vasoactive substances like histamine, platelet-activating fac- tor, and serotonin. Because research indicates that 85% of patients with mitral valve prolapse have chronic magnesium deficiency, mag- nesium supplementation is advisable.125 This recommendation is fur- ther supported by several studies demonstrating that oral magnesium supplementation improves mitral valve prolapse. Supplementation is readily achieved by using magnesium bound to glycine, citrate, malate, aspartate, or another Krebs cycle intermediate (caution is advised relative to the possible neuroexcitatory effects of aspartate). Typical dosage ranges are 200 to 800 mg/day, depending on bowel tolerance. Magnesium sulfates, oxides, and hydroxides are less predictably absorbed and may produce adverse gastrointestinal effects, but they may also be effective. The coadministration of vita- min B 6 is ideal because it facilitates magnesium transport into cells. Caution is advised in administering magnesium to patients with renal insufficiency.

## Lipoic acid

Lipoic acid improves mitochondrial function, has antioxidant effects, and reduces insulin resistance. For these reasons it may be particularly useful for migraineurs with insulin resistance, as demonstrated in an open-label trial using 400 mg lipoic acid b.i.d. for 6 months, at which point nearly 70% of participants had a frequency reduction of at least 50%.126A previously conducted randomized trial among migraineurs with and without aura suggested efficacy for improving headache severity and frequency, but it was underpowered.127


Botanical medicines have a lengthy history of use as traditional rem- edies for migraine headache. Although many botanicals have been used, feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), ginger (Zingiber officinalis), and butterbur (Petasides hybridus) tend to be widely used for migraine prophylaxis and treatment.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tanacetum parthenium

Perhaps the most popular preventive treatment of migraine head- aches is the herb feverfew. Scientific interest in feverfew began when a 1983 survey found that 70% of 270 migraine sufferers who had eaten feverfew daily for prolonged periods found that the herb decreased the frequency and/or intensity of their attacks.128 Many of these patients had been unresponsive to routine medications. This survey prompted several clinical investigations that are supportive of the therapeutic and preventive effects of feverfew in the treatment of migraine frequency and intensity.128–131 However, at least three crossover randomized con- trolled trials found no benefit with feverfew, although each study had limitations.132 Noting that the stability of feverfew can be problematic, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study confirmed the efficacy of the carbon dioxide–based feverfew extract MIG-99 in migraine prophylaxis, using only 6.25 mg three times daily for up to 4 months.133 Feverfew has been suggested to inhibit serotonin release, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and platelet aggregation, inhibit polymor- phonuclear leukocyte degranulation and phagocytosis of neutro- phils, inhibit mast cell release of histamine, promote cytotoxic activity against human tumor cells, and possess both antimicrobial activity and antithrombotic potential.134 In vitro studies have demonstrated that feverfew extract inhibits serotonin release from platelets.129,135 The active constituent remains incompletely appreciated; the plant is rich in sesquiterpene lactones, the principal one being parthenolide. Given the diversity of feverfew’s pharmacological activity, partheno- lide may not be the sole active principle. Feverfew should be avoided or used with caution in patients on anticoagulants because of its plate- let-inhibitory effects.105,107 Feverfew is generally well tolerated, but oral ulceration (especially for those who chew feverfew leaves) and gastro- intestinal symptoms are the most common adverse events; these effects are mild and reversible with discontinuation. Because feverfew is in the same (Asteraceae) family as ragweed and chamomile, individuals with such allergies should avoid feverfew as well. Feverfew is not known to be safe in pregnancy and lactation and should be slowly tapered when discontinued.

## Zingiber officinalis

The common spice ginger root has been shown to exert significant effects in suppressing inflammation and platelet aggregation.108–110 With respect to migraine headache, there is much anecdotal informa- tion and speculation about its usefulness based on its known proper- ties. In recent years, several trials have been published demonstrating ginger’s effectiveness for acute headache relief. In a double-blinded and randomized trial, 100 participants with acute migraine without aura were given either ginger powder (250 mg ginger rhizome) or sumatriptan; the treatments had similar efficacy for relief, but ginger had a better side-effect profile, with only 4% reporting clinical side effects (dyspepsia), compared with 20% of those taking sumatriptan reporting effects, including dizziness, a sedative effect, vertigo, and heartburn.136 Oral ginger (400 mg of a 5% extract) also was shown to be superior to placebo in terms of improving functional status, pain,

and migraine symptoms when added to intravenous (IV) ketoprofen in a randomized, double-blinded trial conducted in an emergency room setting.137

## Petasides hybridus

Butterbur (P. hybridus) has been identified as an effective herbal ther- apy for migraine; its recorded use dates back at least 900 years. In the Middle Ages, it was used to treat fever and bubonic plague, and in the 17th century, it was an oral treatment for cough and asthma and a topical treatment for skin wounds. It has vascular wall antispasmodic properties and an affinity for cerebral vessels; it also inhibits leuko- triene synthesis and lipoxygenase activity.138 Leukotriene synthesis is apparently inhibited by the active principles petasine and isopetasine, which also have a high affinity for blood vessels and produce vasodila- tion.139 In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of patients,139 migraine frequency was decreased by 60% without adverse events (and dysmenorrhea incidentally improved markedly in patients). It is administered prophylactically. Supplementation should be carried out daily for 4 to 6 months and tapered until migraine inci- dence begins to increase. Butterbur is generally well tolerated, but diar- rhea has been reported in some individuals. No drug interactions have been identified, but it is not known to be safe during pregnancy or lactation. The plant’s pyrrolizidine alkaloids are thought to be hep- atotoxic and carcinogenic; for that reason, only extracts that have removed these specific alkaloids should be used.138 The typical adult dosage ranges from 50 to 100 mg twice daily with meals, but 75 mg twice daily has performed better than 50 mg twice daily in some stud- ies.140 Butterbur has diverse properties and could be especially help- ful for migraineurs who also experience dysmenorrhea and/or allergic rhinitis.141 In one study, its efficacy was demonstrated in children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 17 years.142 Although no allergic reactions have been reported, patients who are hypersensitive to the Asteraceae family (e.g., ragweed, marigolds, daisies, chrysanthemums) should exercise caution because of a potential risk of cross-reactivity.

## Hormones

## Melatonin

Given the serotonergic involvement in migraine, it is logical to consider melatonin’s function as well. Melatonin is the product of CNS sero- tonin, which is a downstream metabolite of dietary tryptophan. Nearly 90% of serotonin is produced in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, stored in platelets, and distributed to the rest of the body except the CNS (serotonin cannot cross the blood–brain barrier).143 Tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan can cross the blood–brain barrier to be con- verted into serotonin in the pineal gland, which contains 90% of the CNS serotonin and most of the melatonin.143 The pineal gland serves as an important interface between the environment and the CNS; as such, it may play a role in triggering a variety of external and inter- nal effects such as reactions to certain foods, toxins/odors, flickering lights, sleep deprivation, travel through time zones, menses, and so on. Decreased levels of plasma and urinary melatonin have been observed in patients with migraine.144–146 A deficiency of melatonin appears to produce excessive stimulation of the trigeminovascular system.143,147 Melatonin therapy is successful in some individuals, particularly those with delayed-sleep-phase syndrome,148 and may resynchronize cir- cadian rhythms to lifestyle, subsequently relieving triggers and symp- toms.144 In patients with migraine, the brain does not seem to tolerate the peaks and troughs of life well. Regular sleep, regular meals, exercise, avoidance of both excessive stimulation and relaxation, and evasion of dietary triggers can all help reduce activation. Peres has studied the role of melatonin in migraine extensively and demonstrated in an open-label trial that a 3-mg dose of melatonin was effective in migraine prevention in 25 of 32 individuals with migraine by over 50%. Eight patients experienced a 100% reduction in migraines.149 Other open-label tri- als have found benefit with melatonin supplementation at doses up to 4 mg, although the one published randomized trial using 2 mg mela- tonin did not show benefit.150,151 Although the mechanism of action of melatonin is not understood, melatonin is known to possess the following properties as related to migraine: anti-inflammatory activity; prevention of translocation of nuclear factor kappa B to the nucleus; free radical scavenging; inhi- bition of CGRP-induced vasodilatation; increased inhibitory neu- rotransmitter activity; direct analgesic effects; inhibition of adhesion molecules; inhibition of nitric oxide synthase; and hypnotic effect from GABAergic upregulation.152,153

## Sex Steroid Hormones

Studies have determined that the onset of migraine rises with men- arche.154 Episodes are linked to menstruation in 60% of female migraineurs, a condition described as menstrual migraine.155 Menstrual migraine is particularly significant because many women report their menstrual migraines to be more disabling, longer-lasting, and less responsive to traditional abortive and preventive treatment.156 Such headaches usually improve with pregnancy, perhaps owing to sustained estrogen levels.157 None of the “21/7” contraceptive regimens benefits menstrual migraine, but skipping the placebo pills can prevent migraine in some patients.158 Migraine incidence tends to decrease with advancing age but may either regress or worsen during peri- menopause. It has been noted that headaches occur during and after the simultaneous decline of both estrogen and progesterone. There is no uniform agreement over the relation between hormone levels and migraine, although falling estrogen levels have been noted to be asso- ciated with menstrual migraine. DeLignieres et al. used percutaneous estradiol gel perimenstrually, with significant headache reduction.159 In another study, when percutaneous estradiol was used during the luteal phase, postdosing rebound migraines were experienced.160 Plasma taken from menstruating women and reinfused at another point of the menstrual cycle will reproduce menstrual symptoms, including head- ache; this phenomenon may be indicative of the presence of a pros- taglandin-generating factor in plasma.155 Transdermal progesterone therapy has been anecdotally successful in preventing migraine for some patients, although published studies are lacking. Hysterectomy or oophorectomy has not been demonstrated to be helpful.155 Although estrogen therapy can be effective for menstrual migraine, it is important to remember that migraineurs (especially those with aura) are at higher risk for ischemic strokes; using estrogen replace- ment therapy in these women, particularly in the setting of coagu- lopathy or other factors that promote coagulation, could be risky.158 Additional medications or supplements used daily for a portion of the luteal phase have also successfully prevented menstrual migraine; these include naproxen, magnesium, and triptans.161

## Manual Medicine

Purveyors of manual medicine seem to achieve success in reducing headache through various techniques such as spinal manipulation, massage, myofascial release, and craniosacral therapy. Manual med- icine practitioners frequently identify loss of mobility in the cervical and thoracic spine in migraineurs. Although many forms of phys- ical medicine seem helpful in shortening the duration and intensity of an episode of migraine,162 literature support has been somewhat sparse with regard to manipulation as a modality to prevent recur- rent migraine episodes. However, a randomized controlled trial of

## 1585CHAPTER 198 Migraine Headache

chiropractic spinal manipulation performed in the year 2000 revealed a significant improvement in migraine frequency, duration, disability, and medication use in 83 treatment-group participants.163 In another study of 218 patients, spinal manipulation performed as favorably as amitriptyline for migraine prophylaxis.164 A Cochrane review per- formed in 2004 suggested that spinal manipulation may have a place in migraine headache prophylaxis.165 Tension headache may also respond favorably to these techniques because of the structural com- ponent involved in muscular tension. The incidence of migraine in patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is similar to that in the general population, whereas the incidence of tension headache in patients with TMJ dysfunction is much higher than in the general population.166 Physical therapy for migraine tends to be most effective when it is combined with other treatments, such as thermal biofeedback, relaxation training, and exercise.167


Sufficient evidence exists to support the use of acupuncture to relieve migraine pain.168–174 Interestingly, the mechanism of relief is not clearly endorphin mediated. One study found that the injection of saline or naloxone did not affect the efficacy of the therapy,169 and another found that whereas acupuncture increased endorphin levels in con- trols, the low levels of serum endorphins found in migraine patients did not rise with treatment.175 The mechanism of action may instead involve normalization of serotonin levels. One study found that acu- puncture was effective in relieving pain when it normalized serotonin levels but was ineffective in relieving pain and in raising serotonin lev- els in patients with very low levels of serotonin.176 Although limitations in experimental design make interpretation difficult, acupuncture appears to be successful in reducing the fre- quency of migraine episodes, generally by around 50%. Patients may be blinded with “sham” acupuncture treatments, but practitioners cannot be blinded. Interestingly, clinical outcomes between true and sham acupuncture were similar in two studies.177,178 Other studies and systematic reviews179–182 shed a favorable light on acupuncture in spite of the difficulties posed by study design.

## Biofeedback and Relaxation Therapy

Today, the physiological effect of emotional stress is commonly accepted. Stress is and always has been a part of life. The objective must be to find ways to reduce stressful circumstances when possi- ble and to learn techniques to cope with unavoidable stressors more effectively. Practitioners who take the time to ask patients to describe their emotional stressors typically find that they have deeply enhanced the therapeutic relationship simply by sending a message of caring. They also validate the effects of stress by talking to patients about their lives rather than dismissing symptoms as “just stress.” Patients must be taught that stress management is a critical component of each indi- vidual’s daily maintenance needs and not just an occasional luxury. It is also sometimes helpful to ask patients why they think they are expe- riencing their particular condition. Their comments can be extremely elucidating, often allowing for a breakthrough in therapy. Traditional peripheral biofeedback has produced grade A evi- dence for effectively treating migraines.183 Thermal biofeedback uses the temperature of the hands to help the individual learn that induc- ing the relaxation response will raise hand temperature and facilitate other positive physiological changes in the body. Learning how to take more active control over the body may reduce headache frequency and severity. The effectiveness of biofeedback and relaxation training in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine headaches has been the subject of dozens of clinical studies,180 revealing that these tech- niques can be as effective as beta blockers for headache prevention but without the adverse effects. A recent article concluded that biofeedback is costly and no more effective than employing simpler relaxation tech- niques in migraine and tension headache.184 Other relevant modalities to consider include cognitive-behavioral therapy, neurolinguistic pro- gramming, hypnotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, massage, and laser therapy.185,186 In particular, there is grade A evidence for relaxation training, thermal biofeedback combined with relaxation training, EMG biofeedback, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for migraine prophy- laxis.187 Neurofeedback, a technique that uses electroencephalographic feedback to teach patients how to alter brainwave activity, was effective in an open-label trial of 37 patients, with efficacy sustained on average for 14.5 months after discontinuation of treatment.183 Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation may also be of value; in a trial comparing active therapy with sham treatment, vagus nerve stimulation appeared to reduce the number of headache days, but only after 6 months of use (no benefit was seen at 2 months). Sham trials also suggest it may not only prevent headaches but also may aid in the treatment of acute migraines. In animal studies, it has been shown to stop CSD, the phe- nomenon that underlies aura.188–190 Given the safety and efficacy of these techniques, strong consideration should be given to including them routinely in the care of patients with migraine headaches.191 Exercise should not be overlooked as a helpful modality in migraine headache. Thirty-six patients with migraine who exercised for 30 min- utes three times a week over 6 weeks experienced significant improve- ment in headache parameters. Preexercise β -endorphin levels in these individuals were inversely proportional to the degree of improvement in their postexercise headache parameters.192 Finally, the role of education in the setting of migraine is par- amount to the delivery of quality care. In an open-label prospective study involving a total of 284 migraineurs, 46% of subjects reported a 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency when they were provided with educational materials that included general informa- tion about migraine headache, a headache diary, instructions on how to do range-of-motion stretching exercises, and biofeedback tapes.193 Subjects who tended to worry about impending migraines experienced a significant degree of benefit from the program. Patients reported higher self-efficacy and coping skills after exposure to the educational program.


Migraine headache is a multifaceted condition and should be under- stood as a symptom rather than a disease. Symptoms are often debili- tating, frequently interfering significantly with an individual’s quality of life. A holistic, multidisciplinary approach is necessary for a satis- factory outcome. The challenge for the clinician is to determine which of many factors are responsible for each patient’s migraine process. Identification and avoidance of precipitating factors are important in reducing the frequency of headaches. Avoidance of initiators is partic- ularly significant considering that they are cumulative in effect. Owing to the high incidence (80%–90%) of food allergy/intoler- ance in patients with migraine headache, diagnosis and management may begin with at least a 1-week trial (depending on migraine head- ache frequency) of careful avoidance of all foods to which the patient may be allergic or intolerant. This may be accomplished through supervised modified fasting or the use of elimination diets. All other possible allergens (e.g., vitamins, unnecessary drugs, herbs, etc.) should also be avoided. During this procedure, food-sensitive patients are likely to exhibit a significant exacerbation of symptoms early in the week, followed by almost total relief by the end of the fast/modified diet. This sequence has to do with the addictive characteristic of the

## 1586SECTION 6 Diseases

reactive foods. Once the patient is symptom-free, one new food is rein- troduced (and eaten several times) each day while symptoms are care- fully recorded. Some authors recommend reintroduction on a 4-day cycle. Suspected foods (symptom onset ranges from 20 minutes to weeks) are eliminated, and apparently safe foods are rotated through- out a 4-day cycle (see Chapter 46). Once a symptom-free period of at least 6 months has been established, the 4-day rotation diet should no longer be necessary. An oligoantigenic diet, in which common food triggers are elim- inated, may also be used successfully by some patients, but a longer trial (4–8 weeks) is typically necessary, depending on the frequency of episodes. Foods that are commonly eliminated during this period include dairy products, gluten-containing grains, eggs, corn, choco- late, peanuts, coffee, black tea, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and all processed foods. Some clinicians employ food allergy immunoglobulin testing, with mixed results. It is worth noting that the cause of migraine headache is often not a simple matter of food intolerance. Aberrations in digestive function and detoxification may also complicate the picture. Metabolic waste products of pathogenic organisms may produce distant symptoms such as headache, and foundational care for patients with migraine headache should include correcting intestinal dysbiosis if identified clinically or in the laboratory through stool culture, organic acids anal- ysis, or intestinal permeability assessment. Toxic overload or suboptimal function of detoxification enzymes may theoretically trigger headaches and should be addressed if sus- pected.194 Susceptibility to toxicity is produced by excessive environ- mental exposures, genetic polymorphisms in detoxification enzyme production, and depletion of nutrient cofactors catalyzing Phase I and/ or Phase II detoxification reactions.195Although very few studies have looked explicitly for a role of environmental factors in migraine, a few have been published that suggest environment is a factor. A time-strat- ified case-crossover study of nearly 20,000 patients found that short- term exposure to higher concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , O 3 , and CO immediately increased the risk of emergency department visits for migraine. NO 2 had the strongest association, and all were exacerbated by higher temperatures. A similar effect on migraine emergency room visits in Canada was found, with associations between SO 2 , NO 2 , and PM 2.5 .196–198


As discussed previously, all food allergens must be eliminated, and a 4-day rotation diet should be used until the patient is symptom-free for at least 6 months. Foods containing vasoactive amines should ini- tially be eliminated. After symptoms have been controlled, such foods can be carefully reintroduced. The primary foods to eliminate initially are alcoholic beverages, cheese, chocolate, citrus fruits, and shellfish. The diet should be low in sources of arachidonic acid (land-animal fats) and high in foods that inhibit platelet aggregation (e.g., vegetable oils, fish oils, garlic, and onion).

## 1588SECTION 6 Diseases

availability and use of immune-modulating medications for relapsing MS likely have played a role in the improved long-term MS prognosis.6 Up to 15% of patients with MS never develop any overt perma- nent disability. Most patients, however, develop varying degrees of permanent neurological disability. Although it can be difficult to pre- dict which patients will progress and which patients will have benign MS, several prognostic factors for unfavorable clinical outcomes have been identified. Some of these factors include older age at onset; ini- tial symptoms involving motor function; higher initial clinical activity, including high relapse rate; and increased disease progression in the first 5 years. Smoking tobacco and low serum vitamin D levels have also been determined to be predictors of poorer long-term outcome.

## Epidemiology

It is estimated that MS affects approximately 2.5 million people world- wide and 400,000 people in the United States.6 MS affects about 1 out of 1000 persons in the United States, Canada, and northern Europe. MS typically begins between the ages of 20 and 40 but may occur at any age. Women are more commonly affected than men, with about 60% of cases being female. A strong racial influence on the risk of developing MS exists: it is most common among individuals of white and Caucasian back- grounds, particularly those of northern European descent.7,8 Typical MS is rare among Asians and black Africans but is relatively common among black Americans. The racial predilection of MS is one piece of evidence indicating the strong influence of genes on the risk of developing MS. In addition to racial influences, there is also an interesting geographical distribution of the disease. Areas with the highest prevalence are located in higher latitudes, in both the northern and southern hemispheres.9,10 These high-risk areas include the northern United States, Canada, Great Britain, Scandinavia, northern Europe, New Zealand, and Tasmania.11,12

## Pathogenesis

Experts agree that MS results from an acquired immune dysregulation and aberrant immune activation, leading to inflammatory processes driven by macrophages and B and T lymphocytes in the CNS that result in demyelination and axonal damage. Activated T cells produce proin- flammatory cytokines, which additionally contribute to tissue damage. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α ), interferon (IFN)- γ , and interleukin (IL)-2, have been found in the peripheral blood, CSF, and brain lesions of patients with MS.13–18 Numerous reports document the association between these cytokines and disease activity, thus implicating them as medi- ators of the immunopathogenesis of MS.13,15–17 Anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 and transforming growth fac- tor beta-1 (TGF- β 1)19 have down-regulatory effects on the immune system and are thought to be beneficial in MS.20 Besides the role of macrophages, lymphocytes, and cytokines, other biomarkers, such as enzymes, can play an important role in MS pathogenesis. Matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) is a group of enzymes responsible for the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation as well as remodel- ing extracellular matrix, basement membrane, and other tissues in the body by breaking down collagen components in these tissues. MMP-9s are thought to play a significant role in the transmigration of inflam- matory cells into the CNS by aiding in the disruption of the blood– brain barrier.21,22 Several studies have shown higher serum levels of MMP-9 in patients with MS.23–25 ABC Fig. 199.1 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spine of a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS).

MS pathology is defined as having three different categories of acute white-matter demyelination (The figure discussed in this sec- tion is under Reference 1 and could not be included due to copy- right concerns.).26 The most common types (patterns I and II) show a background of mononuclear phagocytes with perivascular and parenchymal T-cell infiltration. Pattern II is also characterized by immunoglobulin and complement deposition of antimyelin anti- bodies that can damage myelin either by initiating complement-me- diated demyelination or assisting the phagocytosis of myelin by macrophages. Pattern III is seen in approximately 25% of biopsied active lesions and consists of oligodendrocyte apoptosis, and these lesions are similar to viral, toxic, and ischemic processes suggesting a “dying-back” phenomenon. This model of the acute MS lesion appears consistent with the most prevalent theory about MS, namely, that it is an immune-mediated disease. Less understood is what hap- pens chronically after the acute phase: whether there is persistent myelin degeneration (smoldering), inflammation resolves without inflammation (chronic inactive), or if lesions are invested with a thin myelin sheath (remyelinated).

## Risk Factors

## Genes

Substantial evidence indicates that genetic and racial background influence the risk of developing MS.27,28 Caucasian and African American populations appear to be at a much higher risk of developing MS than Asians. Having a first-order relative (parent or sibling) with MS increases the risk of developing the disease by five- to twentyfold. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of the genetic influence on the risk of developing MS comes from studies of twins where at least one twin has MS.29 Among nonidentical twins, the chances of the second twin having MS are 1% to 2%, which is similar to the risk of nontwin sibling pairs. Among identical twins, the chance of the second twin having MS is only 25%, indicating the strong influence of environmen- tal factors besides the genetic background. Although the cause of MS remains unknown, more than 100 genes are thought to affect the risk of developing MS.30 The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are thought to have the strongest association with MS risk, with the most evidence for HLA-DRB1.31

## Infections

Considerable interest lies in identifying the target(s) of the pernicious inflammatory response in MS.29 Viruses and microbial agents have been postulated to be associated with an increased risk of develop- ing MS. For decades there has been interest in the possibility that one or more viruses or other microbial infections might cause MS. This interest stems from the inflammatory nature of MS and the apparent influence of the environment on the risk of developing MS, both sug- gesting the possibility of an infectious etiology. In addition, a sponta- neous inflammatory demyelinating disease, called Japanese macaque encephalomyelitis (JME), has been observed in a colony of Japanese macaques at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. This dis- ease appears remarkably similar to MS, with similar MRI white-mat- ter lesions, clinical findings, and pathological findings. The JME white-matter lesions were cultured and revealed a previously unde- scribed herpesvirus.32 Although various infectious agents have been reported to be associ- ated with MS—including measles, Epstein–Barr virus, distemper virus, coronavirus, retrovirus, herpes simplex, human herpesvirus-6, and Chlamydia pneumoniae—there is no convincing evidence at present of a linkage between any infectious agent and MS.33 The lack of evidence does not exclude the possibility that an infectious agent causes MS, but currently, there is no widely accepted evidence associating MS with any specific virus or other microbe.

## Environment

## Geographical and seasonal influences. The association

with latitude and MS prevalence has shown mixed results and is confounded by factors that include migration, lifestyle habits, and biological and social influences. In general, there is an increased prevalence of MS in northern latitudes (high risk) and a decreased prevalence in southern latitudes (low risk). People who move from a low-risk to a high-risk area before age 15 acquire a higher risk of developing MS, whereas those who make the same move after adolescence retain a lower risk.12,34 These observations suggest that an environmental exposure in the first two decades of life can influence the risk of developing MS. They also suggest that early sunlight exposure, which is correlated to serum vitamin D levels, may influence the risk for developing MS.35 Although not consistent to all geographical areas, there are several European epidemiological studies showing an association between sea- son of birth and the risk of developing MS.36–38 These studies indicate that there appears to be a lower risk for MS for births occurring after summer and a higher risk for MS for births occurring after winter. The authors reporting these findings suggest that maternal levels of vitamin D during the third trimester of pregnancy may influence the risk for MS, with a lower risk when maternal vitamin D levels are high (sum- mer months) and a higher risk when maternal vitamin D levels are low (winter months). Taken together, there is some evidence to suggest that sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels at a young age may have an influential role in the risk of developing MS.

## Diet. Diet has been investigated as a risk factor for acquiring

MS. An association was first suspected based on the observation that inland farming communities in Norway had a higher incidence of MS than areas near the coastline. It was discovered that the diets of the farmers were much higher in animal and dairy products than the diets of the coastal dwellers, whose diet was enriched by cold-water fish.39 Additional studies have since correlated consumption of animal fat, animal protein, and meat from nonmarine mammals with the risk for MS.40 Individual dietary components may also affect MS pathogenesis. One example is the discovery of molecular mimicry between myelin and some dietary proteins, such as butyrophilin protein in cow’s milk, inducing antibodies targeted against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). High salt intake was recently postulated as a risk factor for MS development and to have an association with increased relapses in people with MS. However, this association has not been validated.41 An epidemiological review evaluating the relationship between diet and MS from 1952 through 1995 suggested that the risk of MS is significantly correlated with the following parameters: consumption of animal fat, animal protein, and meat from nonmarine mammals.40 However, a large prospective cohort study using data from the Nurses’ Health Study and Nurses’ Health Study II found no evidence linking the risk of MS with the intake of saturated fats. The authors did note, however, that intake of linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid (O3FA), but not fish oils or docosahexaenoic acid, was associated with a trend toward a lower risk for MS.42 Using data from the same cohorts, this same group also found no relationship between intake of fruits and vegetables and the risk of MS.43 A case-control study in Canada assessing the relationship between nutritional factors and the risk of MS in 197 incident cases of MS and 202 frequency-matched controls found a positive association between animal fat intake and the risk of MS.44 Recent data highlight that vascular disease risk factors such as obe- sity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and diabetes can del- eteriously affect MS progression. The presence of obesity as a child and in early adulthood has been associated with a greater risk of develop- ing MS.41 Because most of the vascular disease risk factors, including

obesity, are influenced by dietary habits, these studies suggest that there likely is an influence of diet on the risk of developing MS.

## Gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is an ecosystem of com-

mensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that outnumber their host’s genes by more than 100 times.45 The gut microbiome and its relationship with health and disease have been subject to extensive research, and the gut microbiome has been shown to be involved in maintaining human metabolism, nutrition, physiology, immune function, and mental health. The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional neurohumoral communication system that integrates neural, hormonal, and immunological signaling between the host gut and brain activities.46 Commensal, probiotic, and pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can activate neural pathways and CNS signaling systems and can influence the development of anxiety and depression.47 The bidirectional relationship is reflected in the observation that stress can influence the integrity of the gut epithelium and can alter peristalsis, secretions, and mucin production, promoting changes in microbial composition.45 The concept of a gut–brain axis suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota may be a feasible approach to the management of CNS disorders with significantly less toxicity than many of the pharmaceuticals used currently. The gut microbiome has been implicated in the induction of autoimmune conditions in human diseases and experimental animal models, including inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondy- litis, uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).48–50 Current methodologies investigating gut microbial diversity, such as next-generation, 16S rRNA gene-sequencing technologies, suggest a “dysbiotic” gut micro- biota in both adult and pediatric subjects with MS.51–53 An alteration in gut microbiota has also been apparent in subjects with MS on DMTs such as glatiramer acetate and interferons.53 Additionally, alterations in gut microbiota appear to be associated with relapse risk in pediatric and adult MS subjects.51,53 The current, but limited, knowledge of gut microbiome changes in MS are intriguing, and it remains unclear if alterations in the gut microbiome precede or are a consequence of MS pathogenesis. University of California–San Francisco (UCSF) researchers suggested a causal relationship of gut microbiota and MS in a study where transplanting microbiota from MS subjects was found to exacerbate symptoms in mice with EAE.54,55 The same group evaluated 34 sets of twins discordant for MS, reveal- ing that transplanting gut microbiota from the MS-affected twins into transgenic mice induced CNS-specific autoimmunity at a higher incidence than microbiota taken from the healthy twins.56 Although human and mouse microbiota are not directly comparable, the bio- logical pathways represented by MS-associated bacterial taxa largely overlap. Many factors, both nonmodifiable and modifiable, can influence the composition of an individual’s gut microbiome. These include genotype, age, sex, disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS such as interferon and glatiramer acetate, antibiotics, and diet. An animal model of the gut microbiome suggests that diet can rapidly influence the gut microbiome, with changes occurring within a single day of diet change from a low-fat, plant-polysaccharide–rich diet to a high-fat, high-sugar diet.57,58 Analysis of the fecal microbiome of a high-fiber diet compared with a Western diet revealed underrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae (Shigella and Escherichia) with an abundance of bacteria from the genus Prevotella and Xylanibacter, known to contain a set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis, useful in digestion in a predominantly plant-based diet.58,59 The Enterobacteriaceae family members associated with a Western diet have been shown to exacerbate small intestinal inflammation, whereas the bac- teria associated with high-fiber diets, including Prevotella and Xylanibacter, are associated with a protective role against gut inflammation.

## Toxins and toxicants. All environmental pollutants have dem-

onstrated prooxidant activity, with the most toxic compounds causing the most oxidative damage. These toxicants also typically deplete the level of reduced glutathione in the brain tissue and inhibit the function of the antioxidant enzymes. Both reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) can directly oxidize and damage DNA, protein, and lipids in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Neurons are directly affected by this oxidative stress, as are the glial cells. Oxidative stress activates the glial cells, leading to an increased production and release of the proinflammatory chemicals interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10); gamma-interferon (IFN- γ ); and TNF- α . The resulting neuroinflammation is a key component in the patho- biology of multiple sclerosis.60 Activated glial cells and mast cells both appear to be responsible for the release of the proinflammatory chemical soup that fuels neuroinflammation. Glial cell activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, MS, motor neuron diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS]), stroke, and mood disorders.61 Neuroinflammation is triggered by traumatic brain injury, endotoxicity (circulating levels of lipopolysaccharides), elevated blood sugar (glycation end products), stress, and a host of environmental toxicants, including air pollutants, heavy metals, and organophosphate pesticides.62 In a case-control study of children with MS having a father who worked in a gardening-related occupation (odds ratio [OR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–4.16) or any household use of pesticide-related products (OR = 1.73, 95% CI; 1.06–2.81) were both associated with an increased risk of developing pediatric MS.63 An Italian case-control study indicated that occupational solvent expo- sures could be related to the risk of MS, as both shoe/leather workers and mechanical manufacturing industry workers were found to have a twofold increase in the odds of developing MS.64

## Summary of Risk Factors

Although there is general agreement that MS is an immune-mediated disease, why people develop MS remains uncertain. Epidemiological studies suggest a complex relationship between genetic and environ- mental factors that can influence both the risk of acquiring MS and disease progression in MS.

# DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS

MS remains a clinical diagnosis.1 No single test (e.g., blood test, MRI examination, CSF study) is adequate to diagnose MS. The diagnosis relies on a knowledgeable physician taking a detailed history, perform- ing a neurological examination, conducting various tests, and then making a diagnosis on the basis of all the data. Among the various practitioners, trained and experienced neurologists usually accurately diagnose MS. Even among neurologists, the rate of misdiagnosis of MS can be high because there are many mimics that appear similar to MS.65 The diagnosis of MS rests on the objective demonstration of two or more areas of demyelination in the CNS that have occurred more than one time, and a diagnosis cannot be based only on a patient’s symptoms. Means of “objective” demonstration of areas of demyelination include the neurological examination; MRI of the brain and spinal cord; CSF examination; and electrophysiological tests (called evoked potentials) that assess visual, auditory, and somatosensory pathways. Evaluation of the CSF in a patient with suspected MS includes the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) production within the CNS, as seen by qualitative (oligoclonal bands) and quantitative (total IgG,

IgG index, and IgG synthesis rate) IgG changes. Excluding other dis- orders that can masquerade as MS is critical; these include unusual causes of stroke; nutritional deficiencies; genetic leukodystrophies or leukoencephalopathies; cancer; spinal cord compression from tumors, herniated disks, or spinal canal stenosis; vascular malformations of the spinal cord; infectious etiologies; and various other inflammatory dis- orders of the CNS (see Table 199.2 for a list). Although MS was for- merly difficult to diagnose, MRI scanning has significantly improved the ability to diagnose MS in its early stages because it allows imaging of areas of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord and also helps exclude the presence of other diseases that might explain the patient’s symptoms. The criteria used to diagnose MS are summarized in the revised 2017 McDonald criteria table (Table 199.3).


<!-- chunk -->

## Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs)

The conventional approach to treating MS includes the use of med- ications to control disease activity and some symptoms and rehabil- itation interventions to alleviate symptoms resulting from damage to the CNS. Medications that help decrease MS disease activity are referred to as disease-modifying agents, or DMTs. (See Table 199.4 for a complete list.) Most of the DMTs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS. These DMTs can broadly be broken down into route of delivery, including inject- able medications, oral medications, and infusions. Compared with a placebo, these medications decrease the relapse rate by 30% to 67%, decrease new lesion formation in the brain as detected by MRI, and decrease the risk of developing a permanent neurological disability.

## 1594SECTION 6 Diseases

The injectable medications form the platform therapies and include human recombinant interferon- β (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Plegridy) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa). Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that mediate antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory processes. There are three major forms of IFNs: alpha ( α ), beta ( β ), and gamma ( γ ), which have some overlaps in func- tion yet are distinct, with IFN- β showing benefit in the management of MS. Although the precise mechanism by which IFN- β works in MS is not certain, the immunomodulatory effects proposed to occur include inhibition of proinflammatory T-cell activation and proliferation, destruction of autoreactive T cells, cytokine modulation, and preven- tion of migration across the blood–brain barrier.19,66 IFN- β therapy has been found to decrease annualized relapse rates by 27% to 36% and reduce disability progression by 30% to 38% in various clinical trials. Glatiramer acetate is a random polymer of four amino acids that stimulates protective T cells and is the safest option of the DMTs. In multiple randomized trials, glatiramer was shown to reduce the relapse rate by 28% and reduce disability accumulation (risk ratio of 0.6) compared with placebo.67 Glatiramer acetate and IFN- β therapies are frequently used as first-line therapy for MS due to an excellent safety profile. Another injectable, daclizumab (Zynbryta), has been taken off the market due to hepatitis risk. The oral medications include three medications, fingoli- mod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). The mechanism of action of fingolimod involves the reduction of CNS inflammation and axonal damage by retaining lymphocytes in the lymph nodes so that fewer are able to enter the CNS.68,69 Fingolimod has been shown to reduce relapse rates by 50%, decrease the rate of disease progression, and decrease disease activity (MRI lesions).68,69 Teriflunomide prevents the division of active immune cells, includ- ing T and B lymphocytes.19,70 Teriflunomide has been shown to reduce relapse rates by 36% compared with placebo and to decrease the rate of brain atrophy as assessed by MRI. Teriflunomide remains in the bloodstream for up to 2 years after discontinuation and is associated with fetal complications in pregnancy when taken by either males or females.19 Dimethyl fumarate is based on a German psoriasis treatment that may enhance Th2 cellular response through the activation of intra- cellular nuclear pathways.71 Dimethyl fumarate affects transcription pathways that change the balance of T helper cell profiles, causing immunosuppression. Dimethyl fumarate decreases the absolute relapse risk by 56% compared with placebo, decreases the number of new lesions on MRI, and decreases the rate of confirmed disability progression.71 The FDA approved-infusions include natalizumab (Tysabri), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), and ocrelizumab (Ocrevus). Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against α -4 integrin that prevents inflam- matory cells from entering the CNS and has been shown to decrease the annualized relapse rate by 68% and reduce disease activity (new or enlarging MRI lesions) by 83% over 2 years compared with placebo.72,73 The main risk with natalizumab is the possibility of developing pro- gressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is associated with exposure to John Cunningham virus (JCV). Natalizumab was taken off the market shortly after its release due to the development of PML before reintroduction with recommendations to monitor JCV antibody, which correlates with risk of PML development.19 Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody to CD-52 that is present on most immune cells in the body and was approved by the FDA in 2014 for relapsing MS. Alemtuzumab is given as two annual infusions and has been shown to reduce relapses by 55% compared with the use of IFN- β -1a.74 Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed at B-lymphocytes and was approved by the FDA in 2017 for both primary progressive MS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab has been shown to reduce annual relapses by 50% compared with IFN- β -1a, with a 95% reduction in new active MRI lesions compared with IFN- β -1a.74 Ocrelizumab, in addition to being approved for the management of relapsing MS, has been shown to be effective in decreasing the accumulation of disability in patients with primary progressive MS and is the only FDA-approved drug for this indication. Ocrelizumab reduced confirmed disability progression by 24% compared with a placebo in those with primary progressive MS.74 Although conventional DMTs are able to reduce disease activity in relapsing forms of MS, they have limitations, which include only a modest effect on prolonging time to disability, rising costs (average cost is more than $60,000 per year), and side effects (e.g., injection-site reactions and neutralizing antibodies for IFN- β ; bradycardia and arrhythmia for fingolimod; birth defects with teriflunomide; flushing and diarrhea with dimethyl fumarate). Corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, given in high doses can decrease the duration of relapses of MS but do not affect the degree of eventual recovery after relapses.75 A number of different medica- tions are useful for treating various symptoms of MS, such as fatigue, bladder dysfunction, and spasticity, but these medications do not reverse the damage that has already occurred or decrease disease activ- ity. Given these considerations, an effort to identify natural therapies that have benefit for people with MS is warranted.

## Natural Medicine Therapeutic Considerations

From a natural medicine standpoint, there are four major approaches to treating MS: • Diet • Nutritional supplements • Exercise • Stress management Including all four provides the most comprehensive natural medi- cine treatment plan, and it is recommended that these should be used in combination with appropriate conventional therapies.


Diet is one way to influence general health, which is important to maintain in people with a chronic disease such as MS. There is no pan- acea diet for MS. However, various health factors, particularly vascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, salt intake, diabetes, and obesity, can contribute to MS disability progression.41 These vascular risk factors are readily influenced by diet and can be modulated with intervention.

## Low-Saturated-Fat Diets

<!-- chunk -->

## Swank diet. The Swank diet is one of the oldest and most well

known dietary interventions used by people with MS. Dr. Roy Swank reported that a diet low in saturated fats maintained over a long period of time tends to slow disease progression, reduce the number of attacks, and decrease mortality.76,77 Swank began treating patients with his low-fat diet in 1948. The approach to using a low-fat diet supplemented with cod liver oil is based on epidemiological studies that found a decreased incidence of MS in populations that had a low consumption of animal fats with a high consumption of cold-water fish. Based on current knowledge of the pathogenesis of MS, the rationale of using the Swank diet or other diets low in saturated fats in patients with MS relates to the general health benefits of such a diet and the anti-inflammatory and perhaps neuron membrane–stabilizing effects

## 1595CHAPTER 199 Multiple Sclerosis

of a diet enriched with O3FAs. Although the consumption of red meat is significantly restricted on the Swank diet, fish appears to be particularly indicated because of its excellent protein content and, perhaps more importantly, its high content of O3FAs. Cold-water fish such as mack- erel, salmon, and herring are rich in O3FAs, which include eicosapen- taenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). As reviewed in the “Nutritional Supplements” section, O3FAs have anti-inflammatory effects that may be of benefit in MS. In addition, because optimal neu- ronal functioning depends on cell membrane fluidity, which in turn depends on lipid composition, optimal essential fatty acid (EFA) levels may be important in exerting neuroprotective effects by maintaining healthy neuronal functioning.77,78 Decreasing animal fats and increas- ing O3FAs in the diet thus may improve neuronal function by modu- lating neuronal lipid composition. Since Dr. Swank’s observational studies, two pilot studies evaluat- ing diet in MS have been conducted. An open-label study evaluated the effects of a diet low in saturated fats combined with fish-oil supple- mentation and vitamin B complex and vitamin C in newly diagnosed RRMS.79 Beside dietary modifications, subjects were advised to reduce their intake of sugar, coffee, tea, and alcohol and to stop smoking. Diet was monitored over 2 years by a 4-day dietary record at the end of each year, and plasma fatty acid levels were monitored at baseline, year 1, and year 2. A significant increase occurred in the intake of fish, and a reduction in food items containing saturated fats occurred after 2 years. A sig- nificant increase occurred in plasma levels of O3FAs, and a significant decrease occurred in plasma omega-6 fatty acids (O6FAs). Over the years of the study, patients had significant reductions in both relapse rates and disability. This study, however, had significant limitations because there was no comparison group. Although caution is warranted in interpreting the results of this small open-label study, its outcome does concur with Dr. Swank’s long-term studies on diet and fish-oil supplementation for people with MS. A partially blinded, randomized controlled study evaluated the effect of low-fat dietary intervention with O3FA supplementation in subjects with RRMS.80 The intervention lasted for 12 months, and the primary outcome was quality of life, evaluated using the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). Subjects were randomized into one of two groups: the low-fat diet/fish-oil group and the diet/olive- oil group. The low-fat diet/fish-oil group followed a diet that did not exceed 15% of saturated fats (percentage of total daily calorie intake) plus fish-oil capsules (daily doses of EPA 1.98 g and DHA 1.32 g). The diet/olive-oil group followed the American Heart Association’s Step I diet, 30% saturated fats (percentage of total daily calorie intake) plus olive-oil capsules (6 capsules of 1 g of olive oil per day). The subjects were followed for an average of 11 ± 2.9 months, and the low-fat diet/ fish-oil group maintained better quality-of-life scores for physical well-being (although not statistically significant) than the group using olive-oil supplementation. The scores on the mental health compo- nent were similar in the two intervention groups. At the 6-month time point, the olive-oil group reported an improvement in fatigue compared with the fish-oil group (P = 0.035), which continued for 12 months. For both intervention groups, relapse rates were reduced compared with the year before entering the study. This study suggests that a diet low in saturated fats with fish-oil supplementation might promote better physical and mental health for people with MS. Because all subjects improved after 12 months, the study also suggests that diet modification in addition to supplementation with a “good oil” (fish oil or olive oil) may be beneficial in people with MS. The epidemiological studies suggesting a link between a high-fat diet and an increased risk of MS coupled with the results from the three low-fat-diet studies reviewed show a consistency in identifying a low- fat diet as a therapy that may benefit people with MS. A person with MS following a low-fat diet will gain general health benefits.

## McDougall diet. The McDougall diet is a very low-fat, strictly

plant-based diet that is based mainly on complex carbohydrates as the main source of energy. This diet is based on starch, with 10% of calories derived from fat, 14% from protein, and 76% from carbohydrates. Animal-derived products, dairy products, and oils are restricted from the McDougall diet.

<!-- chunk -->

## Paleolithic diet. The Paleolithic (Paleo) diet is based on the

idea that humans are better equipped to handle the diet consumed by their Paleolithic ancestors. The Paleo diet is a component of the Wahls protocol for MS management developed by Dr. Terry Wahls. The diet consists of nondomesticated lean meats and plant-based foods except fruits, nuts, roots, and legumes. The ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated fatty acids is 1.4 to 2.0:1. The diet consists of three cups of green leafy vegetables, three cups of sulfur-rich vegetables, and three cups of intensely colored vegetables daily. In addition, two tablespoons of O3FAs and 4 oz or more each of animal protein and plant protein is to be consumed daily. No more than two servings per week of gluten-free grains/starchy foods are recommended, and gluten, dairy, and eggs are prohibited. Small open-label studies have been conducted in subjects with sec- ondary progressive MS with a multimodal intervention consisting of diet, massage, acupuncture, meditation, and implementation of the Paleo diet. These limited studies showed the diet was well tolerated, and although adherence to the diet was not consistent, participants had improved fatigue. The fatigue changes were not clinically signif- icant, and the results were further diluted by the fact that additional interventions were employed rather than just the diet. The Paleo diet also has the added risk of nutritional deficiencies, including folic acid, vitamin B 1 , and vitamin B 6 , from the decreased intake of fortified cere- als, as well as calcium and vitamin D deficiency from the lack of dairy intake.41

## Caloric Restriction

Diet can lead to inflammation via oxidative stress based on the type and amount of food that is consumed. Increases in caloric intake and glycemic load, and a high intake of saturated fat, trans fat, or O6FAs can lead to postprandial inflammation. Inflammation is decreased by the consumption of polyphenols, O3FAs, caloric restriction, and exer- cise. Caloric restriction has shown beneficial effects on disease activity in mouse models of MS. A pilot study evaluating the effect of restricting the diet to to 1800 kcal was performed in 33 subjects with RRMS and 10 sub- jects with PPMS. Although there were no differences in neurological examination results in the follow-up period of 6 months, there was a 59% reduction of activated MMP-9 in subjects with PPMS and 51% reduction in subjects with RRMS.81 In another study, 60 subjects with RRMS were randomized to one of three parallel groups: one group that continued a usual diet, one group with a usual diet enhanced by an initial 7-day fasting episode, and one group with ketogenic diet over the course of 6 months. Subjects were asked to complete the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Questionnaire (MS-54). The subjects who were on the ketogenic diet and those on the initial fasting diet showed an improvement in the MS-54.82

## Essential fatty acids. O3FAs are found in both plant and animal

forms, with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) being found in plant foods and EPA and DHA being found in marine foods. O6FAs include linoleic acid, which is found in vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds, and arachidonic

<!-- chunk -->

## 1596SECTION 6 Diseases

acid, which is found in meat and eggs. The body can synthesize most of the fats needed from the diet. There are two essential fatty acids (EFAs) that cannot be synthesized in the body and must be obtained from food: ALA (an O3FA) and linoleic acid (an O6FA). Omega-9 fatty acids (O9FAs) are monounsaturated fats, are made in the body, and are considered nonessential.

<!-- chunk -->

## Omega-3 fatty acids. There have been multiple studies evaluating

O3FAs in RRMS. One open-label study in RRMS patients (n = 10) showed a significant decrease in MMP-9 levels secreted from unstimulated immune cells after supplementing with fish-oil concentrate at 8 g/day (containing 2.9 g EPA and 1.9 g DHA) for 3 months. All subjects showed a decrease in MMP-9 levels whether or not they were on MS disease- modifying medication.83 O3FAs have been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. In vitro, animal, and ex vivo human studies have reported a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of a number of cytokines, including TNF- α , IFN- γ , IL-1, IL-2, and VCAM-1. One published study documented the effects of supplementation with fish oils enriched with the O3FAs EPA and DHA on cytokine secretion in MS.84 In this study, levels of IL-1- β , TNF- α , IL-2, IFN- γ , prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and LTB4 secreted from unstimulated and stimulated immune cells in people with MS and healthy controls were evaluated. Twenty subjects with MS and age-matched healthy controls were supplemented with 6 g/day of fish oil containing 3 g EPA and 1.8 g DHA for 6 months. All subjects with MS had a stable course of MS for at least 3 months before enrollment, had not modified their diet as a consequence of developing MS, and were not on any DMTs. Outcome measures compared baseline levels of the cytokines men- tioned to levels after 3 and 6 months of supplementation in both sub- jects with MS and healthy controls. After 3 and 6 months of fish-oil supplementation, there was a significant decrease in the levels of sol- uble IL-1 β (P = 0.03), TNF- α (P = 0.02), IL-2 (P = 0.002), and IFN- γ (P = 0.01) in the unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of both groups. A significant difference was observed after 3 and 6 months of supplementation in the levels of soluble IL-1 β (P = 0.01), TNF- α (P = 0.02), IL-2 (P = 0.003), and IFN- γ (P = 0.005) from stimulated immune cells of both groups. Cytokine levels returned to baseline values after a 3-month washout period. One study has examined the use of O3FA supplementation in MS.85 This was a large (n = 312) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with MS were randomized to receive either 20 capsules of fish oil per day or olive oil containing 72% oleic acid for 2 years. The total daily dose of EPA was 1.71 g, and the total daily dose of DHA was 1.41 g. This study reported a trend in improvement in the O3FA– treated subjects compared with controls; however, these results did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.07). There are some criticisms of the study design, including that both groups in the study were advised to follow a diet low in animal fats and high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, both groups developed changes in serum fatty acid content over the 2 years of the study. The lack of a comparison of fish-oil supplementation with a placebo in patients who did not have other dietary modifications may have affected the ability of the study to detect a statistically significant therapeutic benefit of O3FA supplementation.

## Omega-6 fatty acids. There is some experimental basis for

considering supplementation with O6FAs. Two studies in an animal model of MS reported that supplementation with linoleic acid, which is rich in O6FAs, decreased the severity of disease86 and reduced inflammation in the CNS.87 O6FA (linoleic acid) supplementation for the treatment of MS has been investigated in at least three double-blind clinical trials.88–90 O6FA spread (11–23 g/day linoleic acid) was provided in comparison with oleic acid (control). Disability progression at 24 months was pro- vided from two trials encompassing 144 patients and did not show a difference. Two additional studies evaluated relapse risk in 132 subjects with RRMS and showed a small decrease in relapse rate at 24 months (weighted mean difference [WMD] of 0.79, CI 0.63–1.00, p = 0.05). Linoleic acid (2.9–3.4 g/day) did not show a significant decrease in the rate of progression in 65 subjects with progressive MS.19 Evening primrose oil, which is rich in the O6FA gamma-linoleic acid, is commonly used by patients with MS. Gamma-linolenic acid might be more effective than linoleic acid because of its easier incor- poration into brain lipids and its possibly greater effect on immune function.91 However, evening primrose oil contains low levels of gam- ma-linolenic acid, and the product is relatively expensive. Large and prohibitively expensive amounts of evening primrose oil would have to be used to obtain adequate supplementation. In addition, a single pilot trial of evening primrose oil in MS failed to demonstrate any benefit.88 Despite its common use by patients with MS, supplementation with evening primrose oil is not recommended.92 The data to support O3FA or O6FA supplementation are lacking, and although there may be no harm in the use of EFAs, there is no major effect on disease progression in MS.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin D. Epidemiological studies have found that low vitamin

D intake and low serum levels of vitamin D may increase the risk of MS.93,94A retrospective study of serum levels of vitamin D in people with MS (n = 199) found 84% of them to be deficient.95 Studies of vitamin D in animal models of MS have shown that vitamin D has the ability to decrease immune cell–mediated inflammation and prevent disease.96,97 MS studies in animal models suggest that vitamin D may have a beneficial role in MS by affecting the ability of inflammatory cells to enter the CNS.98 Numerous human studies have evaluated both vitamin D sup- plementation and associations between serum vitamin D levels and biomarkers of MS disease progression. One open-label study (N = subjects with MS) using oral calcitriol at a target dose of 2.5 mcg/dL found the intervention safe and tolerable up to a year of supplemen- tation.99 Another study examined the seasonal variation in the serum levels of vitamin D in people with MS (n = 103) and healthy controls (n = 110) and found these levels to be significantly higher in the summer compared with the winter in both cohorts.99 This study also observed that higher circulating levels of vitamin D in women were correlated with lower MS-related disability. A pilot study evaluating 29 subjects with RRMS found a positive correlation between serum vitamin D levels and levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4.100 In another 1-year prospective study, vitamin D supplementation and increases in serum vitamin D concentrations resulted in a significant decrease in annual relapses in MS subjects. This was observed in subjects who had vitamin D levels below 50 nmol/L.19 Thus emerging evidence from both animal studies and human studies suggests that vitamin D may have potential beneficial effects in MS. Given that 30% to 50% of the general population may be deficient in vitamin D,101 experts believe that serum levels of vitamin D should be evaluated to assess and treat vitamin D deficiency in MS. Experts recommend vitamin D supplementation to target a serum level of (40– 60 ng/mL or 75–150 nmol/L).19

## Lipoic acid. Oral lipoic acid (LA) is an over-the-counter supplement

that has been investigated as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective agent in MS. LA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), are potent antioxidants with multiple modes of action. LA/ DHLA can regenerate other antioxidants, such as glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E; serve as an ROS scavenger; repair oxidative damage; and chelate metallic ions involved in oxidative injury. DHLA acts by restoring reduced levels of other antioxidants, such as glutathione,

<!-- chunk -->

## 1597CHAPTER 199 Multiple Sclerosis

and by repairing oxidative damage.102–104 LA is absorbed from the diet and synthesized de novo; it readily converts intracellularly to DHLA. Both LA and DHLA are present in both extracellular and intracellular environments.105 In an animal model of MS, LA has been shown to suppress the development of disease by preventing inflammatory T cells from entering the CNS.106–108 The immunomodulatory effects of LA include inhibition of T-cell production of MMP-9, inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM- 1, and stimulation of cAMP by the prostaglandin receptors EP2 and EP4.106,107,109 One small double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the optimal dosing of oral LA in RRMS.110 In this study, 37 subjects were randomized to one of four groups: (1) placebo, (2) LA 600 mg twice a day, (3) LA 1200 mg once a day, and (4) LA 1200 mg twice a day. The study found that LA given at 600 mg twice a day was barely measurable in serum, whereas LA given at the dose of 1200 mg once daily showed significantly higher serum levels. The study also found an association between higher LA serum levels and lower MMP-9 levels and higher LA serum levels with lower soluble ICAM-1 levels. The investigators con- cluded that oral LA between 600 and 1200 mg can be measured in serum and that higher serum levels of LA are associated with an increased immunomodulatory activity that may benefit people with MS. A pilot double-blind, placebo-controlled study of daily oral mg LA in 51 patients with SPMS revealed a decreased annualized rate of brain volume over the course of 2 years in the LA-treated subjects.111 There was also a trend of improved 25-foot walk time in the group that received LA. Larger studies are under way to further investigate the association of LA and whole-brain atrophy in progressive MS.

## Biotin. Biotin, also known as vitamin H or vitamin B

7 , is a water- soluble B vitamin that is taken orally and is known to have multiple functions in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis. It is known to participate in myelin synthesis by activating the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase. High-dose biotin (300–600 mg daily) has been studied in both primary and secondary progressive MS. An initial pilot study of 23 patients with progressive MS was performed, and 91.3% of the patients had an improvement in clinical measurements.112 Patients with MS with a progressive decline in disability score over the previous 2 years were randomized to either placebo or a formula- tion termed MD10003, a highly concentrated oral form of biotin.113 MD10003 was given at 100 mg three times daily over a 12-month period, and 12.6% of treated patients had an improvement in disabil- ity score by 1 point on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), versus none of the placebo group. Although these studies have revealed promising results, there have been negative results associated with biotin. A study completed in Italy including 41 patients with progressive MS treated with high-dose bio- tin resulted in a significant increase in relapse rate.114 Many of these patients had PPMS and had never experienced an MS relapse before. High-dose biotin has also been shown to interfere with various labo- ratory tests, resulting in a number of adverse events, including at least one death.115 Some of the laboratory values affected include measures of cardiac injury and thyroid function.116

## Ginkgo biloba

Cognitive impairment affects up to 40% to 50% of people with MS,117,118 and there are currently no effective symptomatic therapies for cognitive dysfunction in MS. Ginkgo biloba has been evaluated for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, with mixed find- ings. A recent meta-analysis of these studies reports that G. biloba is safe, but the benefits for cognitive impairment and dementia are not predictable.119 There is one randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study evaluat- ing the effects of a standardized G. biloba extract on cognitive perfor- mance in 43 subjects with MS.120 Subjects were randomized to receive 120 mg of G. biloba twice a day or placebo for 12 weeks. The outcomes of the study included several neuropsychological tests, including the Stroop test, which is a measure of attention and executive function. Subjects receiving G. biloba showed significantly improved perfor- mance on the Stroop test as well as improvement in subjective reports of cognitive deficits compared with the placebo group. This pilot study also showed that G. biloba extract was safe and well tolerated. Although the studies evaluating G. biloba in people with dementia have shown mixed results, this supplement has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in many clinical trials. The pilot study in MS also demonstrated that G. biloba standardized extract given at 120 mg twice a day for 12 weeks was safe in people with MS. Given its safety profile and limited evidence on improving attention and executive function in MS, G. biloba standardized extract may benefit MS patients with cognitive impairment.

## Cannabinoids

Cannabinoids are a group of compounds found in the plant canna- bis, also known as marijuana. The major psychoactive constituent in cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC binds to can- nabinoid receptors (CB) in the CNS and acts as a partial agonist to both CB1 and CB2 receptors. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive constituent in cannabis and the major constituent in the plant. It is thought to decrease the clearance of THC by affecting liver metabo- lism. It binds to both CB1 and CB2 receptors in the CNS, with a higher affinity to the CB2 receptor. Cannabinoids can be delivered orally (e.g., cannabis extract, synthetic THC), through mucosa (e.g., cannabis extract oral spray, nabiximols [Sativex]), and smoked. In a review of nine controlled studies evaluating a combination of THC and CBD (Marinol) for spasticity in MS, it was found that THC– CBD was well tolerated and improved patient self-reports of spasticity, although objective measures for spasticity such as the Ashworth score did not show significant improvement compared with a placebo.121 The authors report that side effects were mild in both the treatment and placebo groups. The authors concluded that there was a significant improvement in patient-reported spasticity with the combination of THC–CBD and that THC–CBD was well tolerated in MS. Unlike the dietary supplements discussed, Marinol is a controlled substance and requires a prescription in the United States.

# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS


In the past, MS patients were often advised not to exercise because increased body temperature and nerve fiber fatigue resulting from exercise were thought to induce transient symptomatic worsening and provide no long-term benefit. However, research has since shown that regular exercise is beneficial for people with MS.122–128 Four studies and two meta-analyses reported that compared with an MS nonexercise group, the MS exercise group demonstrated improve- ment in the subjects’ reports of fatigue, quality of life, well-being, and walking ability.123,124,127,129 A systemic review of 26 studies on the effects of exercise, physical activity, and physical fitness on cog- nitive-performance outcomes in people with MS suggested beneficial effects of physical fitness, physical activity, and regular exercise on cognitive performance in people with MS.130 In addition to direct effects on MS, regular exercise provides benefits in multiple fac- ets of health, including cardiovascular risk; metabolic functioning, including blood sugar maintenance; mental health and mood; bone

## 1598SECTION 6 Diseases

mineralization; and reduced risk for falls.132 MS represents only one aspect of a person’s health, and balancing other factors by maintain- ing a healthy lifestyle is crucial. In summary, evidence indicates that regular exercise is beneficial in MS and should be part of any natural medicine approach to treating MS.

## Stress and Multiple Sclerosis

Patients with MS often report that stress worsens their MS symptoms and consequently triggers an exacerbation. In a review of the scien- tific literature reporting associations between psychological stress and worsening of MS symptoms, an expert panel concluded that there was a possible relationship between antecedent stress and either MS onset or exacerbations.133 A prospective longitudinal study of patients with MS designed to examine the relationship between stressful life events, psychological stress, and disease activity as measured by MRI found that increased conflicts and disruptions in routine were followed by an increased risk of developing new brain lesions 8 weeks later.134 Perceived stress in patients with MS has been associated with MS exac- erbations in a number of studies.135 Given the emerging evidence that antecedent stressors may con- tribute to the development of new lesions in MS and that perceived stress is associated with MS exacerbations, therapies that reduce stress are highly recommended in MS.

## Mind–Body

There are very few scientific studies evaluating mind–body interven- tions such as yoga, meditation, and prayer in MS.136 Mind–body tech- niques using meditation, yoga, and slowed breathing to reduce stress in cancer patients have shown that these therapies are effective in decreas- ing stress, improving quality of life, and improving sleep.137

## Stress Management Therapy

A randomized controlled study investigated the effect of stress man- agement therapy (SMT) in MRI outcomes in people with MS.130 Experienced therapists administered 16 individual 50-minute SMT sessions over a 24-week period followed by a 24-week period of obser- vation. SMT first consisted of six sessions focused on relaxation, teach- ing problem-solving skills, cognitive restructuring, and enhancement of social support. Participants were then able to tailor their treatment using option modules, including management of cognitive prob- lems, communication, assertiveness, fatigue management, anxiety reduction, management of sexual dysfunction, and management of insomnia. MRIs were obtained at 8-week intervals during the 24-week active-treatment period. Although the study was underpowered and enrolled fewer patients than originally planned, significantly more patients who underwent SMT (76.8%) were free of lesions versus the controls (54.7%).

## Tai Chi

There are two reported pilot studies evaluating the use of Tai Chi in people with MS.125,126 To evaluate the effects of training in the principles of “mindfulness of movement” from tai chi/qi gong in MS, 16 patients with secondary progressive MS were divided into 8 matched pairs. Each pair was randomized into a mindfulness group or a usual-care group (i.e., standard medical care for MS). Although there was no difference between groups in measures of balance, there was a significant improvement in the mindfulness group in self-reported measures of MS-related symptoms.125 In a nonrandomized uncontrolled pilot study, 19 people with MS underwent tai chi training twice weekly for 8 weeks. Outcomes measures compared pretraining with posttraining scores. Posttraining outcomes demonstrated an improvement in walking speed, hamstring flexibility, and subjects’ reports of well-being and quality of life.126

## Yoga

There has been one randomized controlled study evaluating yoga in MS.138 Sixty-nine subjects were randomized to one of three groups: (1) wait-list control (n = 22), (2) exercise (n = 26), and (3) yoga (n = 21). Those in the yoga group showed significant improvements in quality of life and physical measures compared with those randomized to the exercise or wait-list control group.

## Mindfulness-Based Intervention

There has been one randomized study evaluating a mindful- ness-based intervention (MBI) in MS.139 One hundred and fifty sub- jects were randomized to an MBI (n = 76) or usual care (n = 74), with an intervention period of 8 weeks and a 6-month postinter- vention follow-up. Subjects randomized to MBI underwent training that included a 2½ hour session, once a week, for 8 weeks and one 7-hour session on Saturdays (Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program).140 Subjects receiving usual care were offered MBI training after completing outcome assessments at the time equivalent of the MBI intervention and at 6 months postinter- vention. Compared with the usual-care group, subjects randomized to MBI showed significant improvements in quality of life, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Mind–body interventions show promise of benefit in MS and offer a nonpharmacological therapy that can be effective in reducing stress, improving fatigue, and improving qual- ity of life in MS.


We believe that a natural medicine approach to MS management should be personalized for each individual, including dietary mod- ification, nutritional supplementation, incorporation of exercise, and stress reduction techniques, complementary to the conven- tional medical approach including the use of DMT. Although the data supporting the benefits of each of these individual comple- mentary therapies in MS management are limited, natural medicine approaches when used in conjunction with the approved MS DMTs have the potential to improve the general health of patients and may provide specific benefit in helping control the disease and improve symptoms.


Although there is no one diet for MS that has a proven efficacy, a few diets, such as the Swank diet (low saturated fat, with 15 g/day or less of saturated fat intake; unsaturated fat intake of a minimum of 20 g/day and maximum of 50 g/day; other details as described ear- lier), McDougall diet (very low-fat, strictly plant-based diet primarily based on starch, with ∼ 10% of calories to be derived from fat, 14% from protein, and 76% from carbohydrates), and modified Paleo diet (nondomesticated, lean meats and plant-based foods except fruits, nuts, roots, and legumes; three cups each of green leafy, sulfur-rich, and intensely colored vegetables daily, two tablespoons of O3FAs, oz or more each of animal and plant protein to be consumed daily) have some limited evidence of benefit with fatigue, quality of life, and possibly mortality (long-term Swank diet studies) in MS. The com- mon theme of all of these diets is that patients with MS should limit processed foods and consume fresh, high-quality, whole foods. The key difference between the McDougall diet and the modified Paleo diet is the consumption of animal food, which is an area of unresolved controversy.

Various oral supplements have been studied in MS, including fish oils, vitamin C, vitamin D, biotin, lipoic acid, and G. biloba. Except for the stronger data showing possible beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation, other supplements have not yet shown convinc- ing benefit in MS management. Biotin supplementation remains currently under investigation, and because of its potential to cause interference with certain blood-based laboratory tests, careful use in clinical practice is warranted. An antioxidant, lipoic acid has con- vincing potential to decrease the rate of brain-volume loss in those with SPMS, and hence its supplementation may be considered. Our recommendation for vitamin D 3 and lipoic acid supplementation is as follows: • Vitamin D 3 : 2000 to 8000 Units/day with the goal of achieving blood levels at an ideal range of 40 to 60 ng/mL 25-hydroxy D3 (supplementing with vitamin D requires attention to vitamins A and K2). • Consider lipoic acid 1200 mg daily.


The type and amount of exercise should be tailored to the patient. Mild to moderate exercise for at least 30 minutes three times a week is recommended for most people with MS. Types of exercise recom- mended for MS can include walking, stretching, bicycling, low-impact aerobics, stationary cycling, swimming or water aerobics, yoga, and tai chi. Strategies to prevent overheating can include the use of air-con- ditioning and a cooling vest that can prevent temporary worsening of MS symptoms.

## Stress Reduction

As with exercise, the therapies used for stress should also be tailored to the individual person with MS. Broadly, key stress-reduction therapies recommended for MS are yoga, exercise, meditation, deep breathing or breathing exercises, and prayer.

## 1601CHAPTER 200 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis

The prevalence of NASH has been difficult to establish because a liver biopsy is required for diagnosis. In 1990 an autopsy-based cross-sectional study reported the overall prevalence of NASH in adults in North America to be 18.5% in obese and 2.7% in nonobese individuals.13 Since that time, the rates of diabetes and obesity have steadily increased, along with the quantity and concentration of toxic compounds in the environment.14–16 More recent evidence estimates the prevalence of NASH to be 12.2%, and among patients with a pos- itive ultrasound for fatty liver, the prevalence of NASH increases to 29.9%.17 NAFLD and NASH disproportionally affect Mexican Americans, men, older adults, and people with diabetes and obesity (Table 200.1). However, when Mexican American and Caucasian subjects are well matched for clinical parameters, particularly for the degree of obesity, there are no significant differences in the severity of insulin resistance or steatohepatitis.18 Aging of the population and the increasing preva- lence of diabetes and obesity are expected to contribute to an increase in the overall burden of liver disease in the United States. Although liv- er-related deaths are increased by NAFLD, cardiovascular mortality is the leading cause of death,19 and NAFLD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.20

# TOXICITY—MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Excess intracellular fatty acids (FAs), oxidative stress, insulin resistance with a decreased adiponectin-leptin ratio, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, metabolic endotoxemia, and mitochondrial dysfunc- tion are all important causes of hepatocellular injury in the steatotic liver.21 It is likely these factors are not mutually exclusive and act in a more coordinated manner. For example, mitochondrial structural defects lead to increased FA beta-oxidation, leading to abnormal cyto- kine production and insulin resistance, which are crucial pathophys- iological factors in NASH.22,23 Interleukin (IL)-6 levels are increased in NAFLD but are significantly higher in those with steatohepatitis as opposed to simple fatty liver.24 Accumulation of intrahepatic FAs can promote the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates, which in turn can impair liver function directly or indirectly by perpetuat- ing the inflammatory response.25 Serum-free FAs have direct hepa- totoxicity through the induction of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequent activation of the mitochondrial pathway of cell death.26 NAFLD is associated with decreased cellular glutathione (GSH), the major endogenous antioxidant produced in the body.27 In addi- tion, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) has emerged as an important cause of ROS overproduction, and higher hepatic CYP2E1 expres- sion and activity have been observed in the context of obesity and NAFLD.28 The higher levels of CYP2E1 in NAFLD may aggravate liver injury from xenobiotic compounds through the generation of harmful reactive metabolites.

## High-Fructose Corn Syrup

Several studies have shown high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to be a contributing factor to energy overconsumption, weight gain, and the rise in the prevalence of obesity.29–31 The fructose in sugar-sweetened beverages promotes insulin resistance.32 HFCS also promotes dyslipidemia,33 increases visceral fat deposits, and increases hepatic de novo lipogenesis.34 In patients with NAFLD, de novo synthesis of FAs from glucose and fructose is dysregu- lated, leading to an increase in plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) and a subsequent increase in the liver triglyceride content.35 Fructose also provokes a hepatic stress response involving activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and subsequent reduced hepatic insulin signaling.36 In a small-scale study, it was observed that consumption of fructose in 49 patients with NAFLD was two- to threefold higher than in 24 control subjects, and hepatic mRNA expression of fruc- tokinase and FA synthase was increased in patients with NAFLD.37 Another study showed that 80% of patients (25 out of 31) with NAFLD consumed an excessive amount of soft drinks, totaling more than 50 g of added sugar per day.38 In patients with NAFLD, fructose consumption was linked with lower hepatic fat content but increased hepatic fibrosis, suggesting that fructose may enhance liver inflammation.39

<!-- chunk -->

## Obesity

The release of FAs from dysfunctional and insulin-resistant adi- pocytes results in lipotoxicity caused by the accumulation of triglyceride-derived toxic metabolites in the liver.40 Excess adipos- ity is associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines, oxida- tive stress, and an exaggerated inflammatory response to endotoxin administration.41

<!-- chunk -->

## Gut-Derived Endotoxins

Dysfunctional gut microbiota may play a role in the development of NASH and activate inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.42 Alterations in gut microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, and metabolic endotoxemia create a low-grade inflammatory state that contributes to the development of obesity and associated NAFLD (Fig. 200.1).43

## Air Particulate Matter

Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation of Kupffer cells, resident hepatic macrophages, and proinflammatory cytokine production have all been shown to play a role in the progression of NAFLD.44 Animal studies suggest airborne pollutants may play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Mice exposed to diesel exhaust particles at μ g/kg body weight developed inflammation and oxidative DNA damage in the liver without systemic inflammation.45 Obese, diabetic mice had increased levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and ALT, enhanced steatosis, and elevated markers of oxidative stress after pulmonary exposure to diesel exhaust particles.46 Researchers have postulated that inhaled fine particulate matter (PM) may aggravate NAFLD by crossing the alveo- lar membranes and entering the circulation, where it accumulates in hepatic Kupffer cells and triggers toll-like receptor (TLR) 4–dependent activation of cytokine release, which leads to inflammation and hepatic stellate cell collagen synthesis.47

## Chemicals

<!-- chunk -->

## Chloroalkenes

Vinyl chloride (VC) is metabolized by CYP2E1, forming chloroeth- ylene oxide, a highly reactive genotoxic epoxide.48 Occupational expo- sure to VC has been associated with steatohepatitis in lean Brazilian petrochemical workers,49 and ultrasound studies demonstrated hep- atomegaly, steatosis, and fibrosis in VC workers.50 A study of 29 dry-cleaner workers exposed to 16 PPM of perchlo- roethylene (PCE), far less than the permissible exposure limit of PPM in the United States, showed they had fatty infiltration, with mostly normal serum aminotransferase levels.51

<!-- chunk -->

## Volatile Organic Compounds

Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as toluene, ben- zene, styrene, and xylene, have been associated with NASH with both normal liver enzymes and abnormal liver enzymes.52 Seventy-five per- cent of household painters with VOC exposures and abnormal liver enzymes had fatty liver on biopsy,53 and 100% of toluene-exposed print- ers with persistent mild liver enzyme elevation had hepatic steatosis.54

<!-- chunk -->

## Persistent Organic Pollutants

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic in nature and can easily cross the biological membranes and accumulate in fatty tissues. Multiple animal studies show that exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorod- ibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) produces toxic manifestations in the liver, including lipid accumulation, hepatocellular hypertrophy inflammatory cell infiltration, and hyperplasia,55 as well as an increase in total hepatic FAs, triglycerides, and serum ALT levels.56 Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153 exposure causes NAFLD with hepatic antioxidant depletion.57

## Toxic Metals

The presence of toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, cadmium, chro- mium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc) has been shown to be a signif- icant risk factor for fatty liver disease in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.161–2.899, p = 0.009), especially with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 24 kg/m2.58

## Mercury

Elevations of serum ALT, indicating NAFLD, are associated with blood mercury levels. In the NHANES 2003 to 2004 cohort, individ- uals with blood mercury levels in the second quartile (25th to 50th percentile) were twice as likely to have elevated ALT.60 Data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) showed that increasing blood mercury levels were associ- ated with increases in AST, ALT, and elevated gamma-glutamyl trans- ferase (GGTP; >56 IU/L).61,62 The primary mechanism of mercury hepatotoxicity may be related to the poisoning of cysteine-containing proteins and GSH depletion.63

# DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS

The gold standard for diagnosing and staging NAFLD is histology via biopsy of the liver.64 However, the risks and costs of liver biopsy have prompted researchers to seek noninvasive methods to diagnose and stage NAFLD. Cytokeratin CK-18 is a serum marker of NASH that has been the most validated. CK-18 fragments stem from apoptosis of hepatocytes and can be measured in plasma. The utility of CK-18 fragments has been validated in a multicenter study, which demon- strated that for every 50-U/L increase in the plasma level of CK-18, the likelihood of having NASH increased by 74% (OR: 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31–2.31).65 Conventional biomarkers of hepatotoxicity include serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl- transferase (GGT), and albumin. Research indicates that several liver enzymes increase in proportionate response to the load of specific classes of toxins.

<!-- chunk -->

## Alkaline Phosphatase

ALP is a hydrolase enzyme responsible for dephosphorylation. It is present in higher concentration in the liver, kidney, and bone. Chronic exposure of pesticides in agricultural workers was found to be associ- ated with significantly higher activities of ALP compared with controls, and the number of years exposed to pesticides predicted higher activ- ities of ALP.66

<!-- chunk -->

## Bilirubin

Bilirubin levels increase in proportion to the level of various PCBs, which is significant because bilirubin is considered the best prognostic measure of chronic liver dysfunction.67,68 Direct bilirubin is inversely associated with NAFLD, with a significant dose-response relationship (p = <0.05), and serves as a protective biomarker, likely based on the endogenous antioxidant and cytoprotectant properties of bilirubin.69

<!-- chunk -->

## Transaminase Enzymes—ALT and AST

ALT is a transaminase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from L-alanine to α -ketoglutarate. For men aged 18 to 20, ALT values >37 IU/L are considered elevated, whereas the cutoff for men over the age of 21 is >48 IU/L. For women aged 18 to 20, ALT values >30 IU/L are considered elevated, and ALT values >31 IU/L are con- sidered elevated for women over the age of 21. Unexplained elevations in ALT level have been used to signify the presence of NAFLD. Data from the NHANES III suggests that the prev- alence of unexplained elevations in ALT level is 7% in individuals with metabolic syndrome and 3.5% in those without metabolic syndrome.70 However, many patients with NAFLD have normal ALT levels, and the data likely underestimate the actual frequency of NAFLD.71 ALT increases in a dose-dependent manner with the body load of blood cadmium, lead, mercury, and PCBs within and above the nor- mal range.72 Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons causes elevations in AST and ALT.73 When serum log-perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; a perfluorinated chemical) increases by 1 unit, serum ALT increases by 1.86 units (95% CI, 1.24–2.48; p = 0.005).74 The AST level may occasionally be higher than the ALT level, especially in the presence of cirrhosis, but the AST/ALT ratio is rarely greater than 2.75 Among patients who have NAFLD without advanced fibrosis, the AST/ALT ratio is typically less than 1, but it tends to reverse as the degree of fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis.76

<!-- chunk -->

## Gamma-Glutamyltransferase

Elevations of GGT directly correlate with alcohol consumption and toxic metal load (cadmium and lead).77,78 Serum GGT, within its ref- erence range, is also associated with organochlorine pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.79 GGT elevates by exposure to other chemicals, especially POPs and several prescription drugs. Workers with a history of alcohol consumption and high exposure to TCDD were found to have a statistically significant elevated risk for out-of- range GGT compared with referents.80 GGT has been shown to be a surrogate marker of NAFLD and may be a simple and reliable marker of visceral and hepatic fat deposition and hepatic steatosis.81,82 GGT shows a significant positive association with Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in subjects with NAFLD, even after waist circumference and hemoglobin (Hb) A 1c are adjusted.83


Managing comorbidities—obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia— with diet and lifestyle modifications is at the forefront of treatment. Weight loss improves liver aminotransferase levels and hepatic steato- sis in proportion to the total amount of weight loss. Thirty-one obese subjects were randomized to 48 weeks of lifestyle intervention (200 minutes a week of moderate physical activity) versus standard dietary counseling alone. Participants who lost ≥ 7% of weight compared with those who lost <7% had significant improvements in steatosis, lobu- lar inflammation, and ballooning injury.84 The addition of flaxseed oil may enhance these lifestyle modifications.85 Antioxidants, such as vitamin E and vitamin C, have shown prom- ise. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study demon- strated that a combination of vitamin C (1000 mg/day × 6 months) and vitamin E (1000 IU/day × 6 months) resulted in statistically sig- nificant improvement in fibrosis score.86 Treatment with silymarin plus vitamin E along with diet and lifestyle modifications reduces GGT levels and decreases noninvasive NAFLD index scores.87 Ginger has been hypothesized to prevent NAFLD via several mechanisms, includ- ing sensitizing insulin effects, downregulating proinflammatory cyto- kines, exerting antioxidant and antidyslipidemic effects, and reducing hepatic triglyceride content.88 Lipotropic agents such as choline, methionine, betaine, folate, and vitamin B 12 help promote the export of fat from the liver and may be helpful in a variety of liver conditions, including chemical-in- duced liver disease. Supplementation with chlorella decreases toxic metals and metabolites by directly preventing the absorption of tox- ins, increasing stool and urinary excretion of metals, and preventing enterohepatic recirculation of toxins.89 Bile acid therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid may be beneficial by reducing bile acid cytotoxicity and protecting hepatocytes against bile acid–induced apoptosis.90


There are few examples of diseases more clearly due to diet, lifestyle choices, and environmental toxins than NAFLD and NASH. Although

several natural health products are helpful, little benefit will be achieved without addressing the fundamental issues of excessive con- sumption of high-fructose corn syrup, excessive weight, and a toxic gut (Fig. 200.2). During the recovery stage, patients must be as careful as possible to avoid every identifiable source of environmental metals and chemicals.

indicated that an estimated 16.9% of children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 years were obese, which increased to 18.5% per the 2015 to 2016 NHANES analysis. Given the health challenges associated with obesity, as shown in Box 201.1, the significance of these increases is staggering.6–8 Obese individuals have an average of a 5- to 7-year shorter life expectancy compared with normal-weight individuals (BMI 20–25), with a greater relative risk for mortality associated with a greater degree of obesity.1,9 Most of the increased risk for mortality is due to cardiovascular causes; obesity carries with it a tremendous risk for type 2 diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. In 2009 the estimated annual medical spending due to overweight and obesity was estimated to be $147 bil- lion.10 The economic cost attributed to obesity was nearly $316 billion in 2010. It is expected to grow to $861 billion by 2030. As shown in Fig. 201.1, the adjusted annual incremental cost for a normal-weight normoglycemic adult was estimated to be nearly $336, compared with $4649 for a diabetic with class III obesity, a nearly 14-fold increase in cost. Weight was shown to increase health care spending for each gly- cemic stage.11

# DETERMINATION OF BODY COMPOSITION

The importance of determining body-fat composition and classifying obesity accurately is hard to overstate because it offers valuable moni- toring, prognostic, and therapeutic information. In terms of body-fat percentage, obesity is defined as greater than 30% body fat for women and 25% body fat for men. Because direct analysis of body composi- tion cannot be performed on live subjects, indirect methods must be employed, such as those listed in Box 201.2.

## Visual Observation

Superficial visual observation is often all that is required for a quali- tative analysis of obesity. One popular way of classifying body types is somatotyping—a physical, anthropological classification of physique based on body size and proportion: • The endomorph has a relatively large body and short arms and legs. • The mesomorph has a large, muscular chest that dominates the abdomen and has prominent bony joints. • The ectomorph has a relatively small frame (a slender, delicate bone structure) and long arms and legs. The endomorph is at greatest risk for developing obesity, the mesomorph is at moderate risk, and the ectomorph is extremely unlikely to develop obesity. Indeed, somatotyping also has some predictive value for metabolic syndrome because ectomorphy is more predictive of a favorable metabolic profile, even among obese women.12

The distribution of body fat is also important in the classification of obesity. Two basic distribution patterns exist: gynecoid and android, or female- and male-patterned obesity. These types are discussed in greater detail under “Types of Obesity.”

## Skinfold Thickness

The amount of total body fat can be estimated by measuring the thickness of the subcutaneous fat (skinfold or fatfold thickness). Skinfold thickness is measured with skinfold calipers at several sites on the body to improve accuracy. The most common mea- surement sites are the triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfolds. Although skinfold thickness measurements are easy to obtain and are generally accurate in estimating body-fat percentage, their lim- itations include the inability to control intersubject and intrasubject variations in skinfold compressibility, the inability to palpate the fat–muscle interface, and the impossibility of obtaining interpretable measurements on very obese individuals.

variability, as well as the use of different types of skinfold calipers, may contribute to measurement errors. However, for most clinical purposes, skinfold measurements provide the easiest and least expensive method for estimating body-fat percentage. For more precise estimations, other meth- ods (e.g., bioelectrical impedance, ultrasound, total body elec- trical conductivity, and hydrostatic weighing) offer significant advantages.

## Body Density

Measurement of body density provides a quantitative technique for measuring body fat. Density is determined from the specific gravity, which is calculated by measuring the different weights of the body in and out of water. In this procedure, individuals are weighed underwa- ter and out of water, taking into account the residual volume of the lungs. This information is used to fractionate the body into its fat and nonfat components because fat is lighter than water and other tissues are heavier than water. The method is relatively simple if appropriate facilities are available. The major limitation of hydrostatic weighing is that it requires considerable cooperation from the subject, who must exhale completely and then submerge totally underwater up to times, making the method impossible to use with elderly, ill, or hospi- talized patients. With the advent of more sophisticated body-composition analyz- ers, the hydrostatic weighing procedure has generally fallen out of favor, although many experts still consider it to be the gold standard of body-composition determination. However, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is fast becoming the new gold standard because it provides greater precision with only one measurement and can show exactly where fat is distributed throughout the body. DEXA is based on a three-compartment model that divides the body into total body mineral, fat-free soft (lean) mass, and fat tissue mass. DEXA uses a whole-body scanner that has two low-dose x-ray beams from different sources reading bone and soft tissue mass simultane- ously. The sources are mounted beneath the table with a detector overhead. The scanner passes across a person’s reclining body, with data collected at 0.5-cm intervals. A scan takes between 10 and minutes.

## Bioelectric Impedance

The bioelectrical impedance method for determining body composition is based on measuring the conduction of an applied electrical current through body tissues. In biological structures, the application of a constant, low-level alternating current results in a frequency-dependent impedance to the flow of the current, according to the type of tissue. Intracellular and extracellular fluids behave as electrical conductors, whereas the cell mem- branes act as electrical condensers. At low frequencies, such as 1 kHz, the current mainly passes through the extracellular fluids, whereas at higher frequencies, such as 500 to 800 kHz, it penetrates the intracellular and extracellular fluids. Thus body fluids and electrolytes function as electrical conductors, whereas cell membranes behave as capacitors. Because fat-free mass has a much greater conductivity than does fat, there is a strong relationship between conductance and lean body mass. Body composition analysis, as determined by bioelectri- cal impedance, is a safe, noninvasive procedure that provides rapid measurements. Home scales equipped with bioelectrical impedance units to assess body-fat percentage and weight are now available. These scales typically cost between $50 and $200 (Table 201.2).

# TYPES OF OBESITY

Obesity is divided into several categories on the basis of the size and number of fat cells and also on how the fat is distributed in the body (e.g., in the abdomen vs. the hips). In hyperplastic obesity, there are increased numbers of fat cells throughout the body. The number of fat cells that a person has depends primarily on the diet of the mother while the individual was still in the womb as well as on early infant nutrition. An excess of calories during these early stages of development can lead to the formation of an increased number of fat cells for the rest of that individual’s life.

usually begins in childhood. Fortunately, this type of obesity tends to be associated with fewer serious health effects than other types of obesity. Hypertrophic obesity is characterized by an increase in the size of each fat cell and is linked to diabetes, heart disease, high blood pres- sure, and other serious disturbances of metabolism.8 With hypertro- phic obesity, the fat distribution is usually around the waist. This type of distribution is referred to as male-patterned or “android” because it is typically seen in the obese male. If the waist is larger than the hips, a person is said to have android obesity. If the hips are larger, then a person has female-patterned or “gynecoid” obesity. Both of these pat- terns are associated with an increase in visceral and ectopic fat depos- its, with organ damage as a result (Fig. 201.2). There appear to be both genetic and epigenetic influences on the capacity of subcutaneous adi- pose tissue to accommodate excess fat; once this capacity is exceeded, fat deposits in intra-abdominal/visceral areas, and these dysfunctional adipose deposits produce a variety of toxic lipid intermediates associ- ated with inflammation, cardiovascular risk, and insulin resistance.13 The waist-to-hip ratio is determined by measuring the circumference of the waist about ½ in. above the navel and measuring the circumference of the hips at the greatest protrusion of the buttocks. The waist circumfer- ence is then divided by the hip circumference. A waist-to-hip ratio above for men and above 0.8 for women is associated with metabolic syndrome (also known as syndrome X) and increases the risk of developing type diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, stroke, and gout. Finally, in hyperplastic-hypertrophic obesity, there is an increase in both the number and size of fat cells.

# CAUSES OF OBESITY

Although there may or may not be a specific “obesity gene,” the tendency to be overweight is definitely inherited. Genome-wide association stud- ies (GWASs) have already found 127 susceptibility-gene sites within the human genome, such as the FTO and SLC6A14 genes, with the former now considered to be the most significant candidate gene contributing to obe- sity in both children and adults.14 Nonetheless, even high-risk individuals can avoid obesity, indicating that dietary and lifestyle factors (primarily little or no physical activity) are chiefly responsible for obesity. It is worth noting, for example, that Americans are estimated to spend the majority of their waking hours in sedentary activity, averaging 7.2 to 9.5 hours per day.15 However, in looking at possible causes beyond diet and lifestyle, researchers have focused on both psychological and physiological factors.

## Psychological Factors

In the past, psychological factors were thought to be largely responsible for obesity. An early popular theory proposed that overweight individuals were insensitive to internal signals for hunger and satiety while simultane- ously being extremely sensitive to external stimuli (sight, smell, and taste) that could increase the appetite. One source of external stimuli that has definitely been shown to be associated with obesity is watching television. Watching television has been demonstrated to be linked to the onset of obesity, and there is a dose-related effect. Increased television view- ing and decreased physical activity are thought to be primary causes of the growing prevalence of obesity among children in the United States. Television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated not only with being overweight but also with poor fitness and the presence of obesity, smoking, and elevated cholesterol levels in adulthood, indi- cating that excessive television viewing has long-lasting adverse effects on health.16 We now have preliminary data showing that interventions that target sedentary activity among children as young as 4 to 7, par- ticularly to reduce television watching (and screen-time in general), do lower BMI, partly mediated by reduced energy intake.17 In addition to leading to childhood obesity, television viewing also contributes to overweight in adults. In one study, 50,277 women with BMIs below 30 completed questions on physical activity and sedentary (cid:38)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:85) (cid:39)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:86) (cid:36)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86) (cid:38)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81) (cid:43)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:75)(cid:92)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:80) (cid:38)(cid:82)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81) (cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:72)

behaviors at baseline. During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5%) of these women became obese (their BMIs were at or above 30), and 1515 new cases of type 2 diabetes occurred. Time spent watching television was pos- itively associated with the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Each 2-hour- per-day increment in television watching was associated with a 23% increase in obesity and a 14% increase in the risk of diabetes. In contrast, each 2-hour-per-day increment in sitting at work was associated with a 5% increase in obesity and a 7% increase in diabetes.18 In 2018 a meta-anal- ysis of 34 prospective studies found positive associations between seden- tary behavior and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, as well as incident type 2 diabetes, with even stronger associations for television viewing specifically (all adjusted for physical activity; Fig. 201.3). Although watching television fits nicely with the psychological theory (increased sensitivity to external cues), several physiological effects of watching television promote obesity, such as reducing phys- ical activity, interfering with sleep, encouraging increased energy con- sumption, and the actual lowering of resting (basal) metabolic rate to a level similar to that experienced during trance-like states. These factors clearly support the physiological view.

## Physiological Factors

Although the psychological theories primarily propose that obese indi- viduals have a decreased sensitivity to internal cues of hunger and satis- faction, an emerging theory of obesity states almost the opposite—that obese individuals appear to be extremely sensitive to specific internal cues.7 Unfortunately, these cues relate to dysfunctional appetite con- trol due to a combination of genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors. At the center of this dysfunction, in many cases, is resistance to the hormone insulin as a result of a conditioned reaction to a high-glycemic diet. The development, progression, and maintenance of obesity constitute a vicious positive-feedback cycle consisting of insulin resistance, central adiposity, alterations in adipokine secretion by adipocytes and gut-de- rived hormones, impaired diet-induced thermogenesis, and low brain serotonin levels. All of these factors are interrelated and support the the- ory that obesity is primarily an adaptive physiological response that is out of control. Failure to address these underlying areas and provide proper psychological support results in only temporary weight loss at best. Body weight is closely tied to what is referred to as the set point— the weight that a body tries to maintain by regulating the amount of food and calories consumed. Research with animals and humans has found that each person has a programmed set-point weight. It has been postulated that individual fat cells control this set point: when the enlarged fat cells in obese individuals become smaller, they either send powerful messages to the brain to eat or they block the action of appetite-suppressing compounds like leptin. The existence of this set point helps to explain why most diets do not work. Although the obese individual can fight off the impulse to eat for a time, eventually the signals become too strong to ignore. The result is rebound overeating, with individuals often exceeding their previous weight. In addition, their set point is now set at a higher level, making it even more difficult to lose weight. This has been termed the “ratchet effect” and “yo-yo dieting.” The key to overcoming the fat cells’ set point appears to be increas- ing the sensitivity of the fat cells to insulin. This sensitivity apparently can be improved, and the set point lowered, by exercise, a specially designed diet, and several nutritional supplements (discussed later). The set-point theory suggests that a diet that does not improve insulin sensitivity will most likely fail to provide long-term results. When fat cells, particularly those around the abdomen, become full of fat, they secrete a number of biological products (e.g., resistin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor, free fatty acids) that dampen the effect of insulin, impair glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, and promote glucose production by the liver. Also important is that as the number and size of fat cells increase, they lead to a reduction in the secretion of compounds that promote insulin action, including a novel protein produced by fat cells known as adiponectin. Adiponectin is not only associated with improved insulin sensitivity but also has anti-inflam- matory activity, lowers triglycerides, and blocks the development of atherosclerosis. The net effect of all of these actions by fat cells is that they severely stress the mechanisms governing blood sugar control and also lead to the development of the major complication of diabetes— atherosclerosis. Because of all of these newly discovered hormones secreted by fat cells, many experts now consider the adipose tissue a member of the endocrine system.19,20

## Adipokines and Gut-Derived Hormonal Alterations

It could be argued that obese individuals are more sensitive to internal signals to eat. Appetite reflects a complex system that has evolved to help humans deal with food shortages. Therefore it is extremely biased toward weight gain. It makes sense that the people who survived fam- ines were those who were more adept at storing fat than burning it. So there is a built-in tendency in many people to overeat even though food is readily available in developed countries. To combat the tendency to eat more than is required, it is important to accentuate the normal physiological processes that curb the appetite. An elaborate system exists that is supposed to tell the hypothalamus when the body requires more food as well as when enough food has been consumed. In addition, adipokines like leptin, a strong signal of appetite control, actually originate from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to nerve signals feeding back to the central nervous system is a growing list of gut-derived hormones and peptides, such as neuro- peptide Y and the analogs ghrelin and cholecystokinin.21 For example, peptide YY 3-36 (or PYY for short) dramatically reduced appetite in both obese and normal-weight individuals.22 The subjects consumed about 30% less at an “all-you-can-eat” buffet after receiving an infu- sion of this hormone than they did when they were given only saline solution. The subjects also ate significantly less over the next 24 hours. Unlike PYY, the stomach-derived hormone ghrelin increases appe- tite. Ghrelin levels are highest when the stomach is empty and during calorie restriction. Obese individuals tend to have elevated ghrelin lev- els to begin with, and when they try to lose weight, their ghrelin levels increase. Part of the success of gastroplasty in producing permanent weight loss is thought to be due to significantly reduced ghrelin levels. For example, a diet-induced weight loss of 17% of initial body weight was associated with a 24% increase in the area under the curve (AUC) for the 24-hour ghrelin profile. However, despite a 36% weight loss after gastric bypass, the AUC for the ghrelin profile in the gastric-by- pass group was 77% lower than in normal-weight controls and 72% lower than in matched obese controls.23 Although it is possible to use various appetite regulators as therapeu- tic agents in human obesity, preliminary studies seem to indicate that in humans, compensatory actions may negate the effect. The perfect drug or natural product to affect appetite must be able to increase insulin sensitivity and produce a targeted effect of reducing factors that increase appetite while simultaneously increasing factors that decrease appetite. Highly viscous dietary fiber may prove useful in this application.

## Gut-Derived Appetite Regulators

The main hormones inhibiting food intake are cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin, and PYY, whereas hormonal stimulators of appetite include ghrelin and orexin A.21 It could be strongly argued that secretion of these regulators, as well as overall enteroendocrine cell function, is regulated by the presence or absence of highly viscous dietary fiber, especially because the main

targets for these neurotransmitters are vagal afferent neurons and the appetite-inhibiting effects of CCK are enhanced by the mechanical effects of dietary fiber (gastric distention). Brief descriptions of these gut-derived appetite regulators follow.

<!-- chunk -->

## Cholecystokinin. The role of CCK as a regulator of protein and fat

digestion in the upper small intestine has been recognized for several decades. CCK determines the capacity for digestion by controlling gastric emptying as well as the delivery of enzymes from the pancreas. The inhibi- tion of appetite by CCK has been demonstrated in human studies.21,24 The reduction of food intake by low-dose exogenous CCK is enhanced with moderate gastric distention, implying synergistic interactions between CCK and the stimulation of gastric mechanoreceptors. Not surprisingly, viscous dietary fiber has been shown to increase the secretion of CCK.25,26

<!-- chunk -->

## Glucagon-like Peptide-1. The distal intestinal glucagon-like pep-

tide-1 (GLP-1) is derived from different regions of the glucagon pre- cursor. Infusion of GLP-1 inhibits food intake, decreases sensations of hunger, and inhibits plasma ghrelin (discussed further later in the chapter). The secretion of GLP-1 is clearly influenced by food intake, but the specific food components, as well as the role of dietary fiber, have not yet been determined.27

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxyntomodulin. Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is released from the

gut postprandially in proportion to food volume and energy content. Circulating levels of OXM are elevated in several conditions associ- ated with anorexia. Injection of OXM reduces food intake, presumably by suppressing ghrelin. Elevated levels of endogenous OXM asso- ciated with disorders of the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to anorexia.28

<!-- chunk -->

## Peptide YY. Peptide YY (PYY) is secreted by enteroendocrine cells

of the ileum and colon, and a related compound pancreatic polypep- tide is secreted by the pancreas.29 In obese subjects, basal and post- prandial plasma concentrations of PYY are reduced compared with normal subjects. Administration of PYY inhibits food intake, with effects lasting up to 24 hours after a 2-hour infusion, suggesting that PYY exerts significant long-term appetite-suppressing action.30 Like CCK, viscous dietary fiber likely raises PYY.31

<!-- chunk -->

## Ghrelin. Ghrelin is an interesting peptide that originates from

X-cells in the stomach lining. This compound makes the stomach rum- ble, and it is a powerful appetite stimulator.32 Not surprisingly, plasma concentrations of ghrelin are depressed in patients with anorexia nervosa and elevated in obesity. Concentrations of ghrelin decrease on feeding, especially with meals containing dietary fiber. However, because this effect is mediated by insulin, resistance to insulin is asso- ciated with higher ghrelin levels.33

<!-- chunk -->

## Orexin A. The peptide orexin A has been most intensively stud-

ied in the hypothalamus, but it also occurs in enteric neurons and in gut endocrine cells, particularly enterochromaffin cells. Orexin A is a stimulator of appetite and is thought to inhibit CCK-stimulated exci- tation of vagal afferent fibers (thereby negating the appetite-suppress- ing effect of CCK). Plasma concentrations of orexin A increase with fasting and may contribute to overeating during or immediately after a meal by suppressing satiety signaling by CCK.21

## Diet-Induced Thermogenesis

Another physiological difference between obese and thin people is how much of the food consumed is converted immediately to heat. This process is known as diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produc- tion). Researchers have found that a meal may stimulate up to a 40% increase in diet-induced thermogenesis in lean individuals. In contrast, overweight individuals often display only a 10% or less increase.34 In overweight individuals, the food energy is stored instead of being con- verted to heat, as it is in lean individuals. A major factor for the decreased thermogenesis in overweight people is, once again, insulin insensitivity.35 Therefore, the enhance- ment of insulin sensitivity may go a long way toward reestablishing normal thermogenesis as well as resetting the set point in overweight individuals. Researchers have also shown that even after weight loss has been achieved, individuals predisposed to obesity still have decreased diet-induced thermogenesis compared with lean individuals.36 Therefore it is important to continue to support insulin sensitivity and proper metabolism indefinitely if weight loss is to be maintained. In addition to insulin insensitivity and reduced sympathetic ner- vous system activity, another factor determines diet-induced thermo- genesis: the amount of brown fat. Most fat in the body is “white fat,” consisting of an energy reserve containing triglycerides stored in a sin- gle compartment. Tissue composed of white fat looks white or pale yel- low. Brown fat cells contain multiple fat-storage compartments. The triglycerides are localized in smaller droplets surrounding numerous mitochondria. An extensive blood vessel network and the density of the mitochondria give the tissue its brown appearance as well as its increased capacity to metabolize fatty acids.37 Brown fat does not metabolize fatty acids to adenosine triphos- phate (ATP) as efficiently as other tissues of the body, including white fat, because the mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein (UCP1), found in brown fat only, uncouples the mitochondrial mem- brane potential, dissipating energy as heat rather than as ATP produc- tion.38 Brown-fat activity is stimulated by cold exposure and plays a major role in diet-induced thermogenesis (Fig. 201.4). Additionally, activation of brown fat appears to improve insulin sensitivity, and cold acclimation protocols not only activate brown fat but also increase resting energy expenditure, whole-body glucose disposal, and insulin sensitivity, but only among individuals with detectable brown- fat deposits.39 Therapies to increase the proportion and activation of brown fat may prove to be valuable in the treatment of both obesity and diabetes. Some theories suggest that lean people have a higher ratio of brown to white fat than overweight individuals. Evidence supports this the- ory. The amount of brown fat in modern humans is extremely small (estimates are 0.5%–5% of total body weight), but because of its pro- found effect on diet-induced thermogenesis, as little as 1 oz of brown fat (0.1% of body weight) could make the difference between main- taining body weight or putting on an extra 10 lb/year.37 Lean individuals also tend to respond differently to excess calories than those who are overweight. In one experiment, lean individuals were overfed to increase their weight. In order to maintain the excess weight, they had to increase their caloric intake by 50% over their previous intake.40 The opposite appears to be the case in overweight and formerly overweight individuals. In addition to requiring fewer calories to gain and maintain their weight, studies have shown that in order to maintain a reduced weight, formerly obese persons must restrict their food intake to approximately 25% less than a lean person of similar weight and body size.41 Individuals predisposed to obesity because of decreased diet-induced thermogenesis have been shown to be extremely sensitive to marked weight gain when consuming a high-fat diet compared with lean indi- viduals.42 These individuals are not only more sensitive to the weight gain–promoting effects of a high-fat diet but also tend to consume much more dietary fat than lean individuals and to exercise less. Additionally, the combination of increasing exercise and decreasing caloric intake, at least among women, has been associated with a decrease in brown- fat activity rather than an increase, providing one further reason why weight loss becomes increasingly difficult over time.43

## The Low-Serotonin Theory

A considerable body of evidence demonstrates that brain sero- tonin plays a major role in influencing eating behavior. Initial stud- ies showed that when animals and humans are fed diets deficient in tryptophan, appetite is significantly increased, resulting in the binge eating of carbohydrates.44,45 The diet low in tryptophan leads to low brain serotonin levels, a condition the brain interprets as starvation, so the appetite control centers are stimulated to prefer carbohydrates. Feeding animals or humans a carbohydrate meal leads to increased tryptophan delivery to the brain, resulting in the elevated manufacture of serotonin. This scenario has led to the idea that low serotonin levels lead to “carbohydrate cravings” and play a major role in the develop- ment of obesity. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that concentrations of tryptophan in the bloodstream and subsequent brain serotonin levels plummet with dieting.46 In response to severe drops in sero- tonin levels, the brain simply puts out such a strong message to eat that it cannot be ignored. This explains why most diets do not work. Cravings for carbohydrates due to low serotonin levels can be mild or severe. They may range in severity from the desire to nibble on a piece of bread or a cookie to uncontrollable binging. At the upper end of the spectrum of carbohydrate addiction is bulimia, a potentially serious eating disorder characterized by binge eating and purging of the food through forced vomiting or the use of laxatives. The medical consequences of bulimia can be severe (e.g., rupture of the stomach, erosion of the dental enamel, and cardiac disturbances due to loss of potassium).


Environmental pollutants and exposure to everyday chemicals have also emerged as playing a significant role in the diabetes and obe- sity epidemic, one that has largely been overlooked. Multiple lines of evidence point to toxicants commonly found in the environment— named “obesogens” by researchers—with multiple mechanisms of action. Examples include increasing both the number and size of fat cells, impairing insulin sensitivity, and influencing hormones involved in appetite and satiety (Fig. 201.5). Not only do these toxins pose a risk for obesity, but their long-term storage in adipose cells may be a risk factor for numerous chronic conditions typically associated with obesity. For example, in an analysis of the 1999 to 2002 NHANES data set, six persistent organic pollutants (POPs; two polychlorinated diben- zodioxins [PCDDs], one polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB], and three metabolites of organochlorine pesticides) carried an adjusted odds ratio for diabetes as high as 11.8 (oxychlordane) when comparing the highest to lowest individual toxin exposure levels. When participants were classified by their combined exposure to all six POPs, the preva- lence of diabetes rose to 40-fold higher in the highest exposure group. The risk of diabetes associated with high exposure was stronger as BMI increased and was maintained at all BMI levels. However, in people

## Fig. 201.4 Regulation of human brown fat and induction of white-fat browning. Several physiologi-

cal conditions have been demonstrated to influence brown-fat activity in humans. When present in human adults, cold activates the brown-fat depots, which mainly are present at the cervical, supra- clavicular, and paravertebral areas and sometimes also in the perirenal region. Brown fat is also induced in response to a meal and is activated in a circadian manner in mice and seems to have a biorhythm with an opposing pattern to plasma glucose in humans. Aging is negatively associated with the appearance of active brown fat. In terms of browning of white-fat depots, physical exer- cise has been shown in mice to induce browning of subcutaneous inguinal fat; however, this has not been reproducible in subcutaneous fat in humans.

with low toxin exposure, the typical link between obesity and diabetes was not observed. Similarly, diabetes was quite rare among those with low exposure, even in the highest BMI category, and similar (but not identical) trends have been observed in Finland and Spain (see Fig. 201.6).47 This strongly suggests that these toxins may be playing an active role in the metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity and diabe- tes, and adipose tissue is a storage depot for these metabolic toxins (rather than an independent toxin itself). The release of these toxins during weight loss may contribute to some of the adverse effects often reported, including impaired energy metabolism and subsequent weight regain.48 Indeed, weight loss in those with a high POP bur- den may present a hazard because POP levels are able to successfully explain the “obesity paradox”—that is, individuals with an elevated BMI have a paradoxically lower mortality risk in some studies. Analysis of NHANES data found that this paradox does not exist if POP levels are low, and that adiposity may have a protective effect for those with high exposure, by pulling lipophilic toxins out of circulation and thus diluting their impact on physiological function.49 It is also worth not- ing that individuals with an elevated BMI may have lower serum levels of these toxins than those with a lower BMI, even if they have a higher total body burden, because toxins are pulled into the adipose tissue and out of circulation, misleading the practitioner into suspecting a low toxin load.


Over the long term, the control of obesity is one of the greatest clinical challenges. Few people want to be overweight, most express a strong desire to lose weight, yet only 5% of obese individuals can attain and maintain “normal” body weight for a year or more, whereas 66% of those just a few pounds or so overweight are able to do the same. The successful program for obesity is consistent with the basic foundations of good health—a positive mental attitude, a healthy life- style (regular exercise being especially important), a health-promot- ing diet, and supplementary measures. All of these components are interrelated, creating a situation where no single component is more important than any other. Improvement in one facet may be enough to result in some positive changes, but incorporating all components yields the greatest results. Literally hundreds of diets and diet programs claim to be the answer to the problem of obesity and represent a multibillion-dollar industry. Dieters are constantly bombarded with new reports of yet another “wonder” diet. However, the basic equation for losing weight never changes. In order for an individual to lose weight, energy intake must be less than energy expenditure. This goal can be achieved by decreasing caloric intake or by increasing the rate at which calories are metabolized. To lose 1 lb, a person must consume 3500 fewer calories than he or she expends. The loss of 1 lb each week requires a negative caloric balance of 500 calories/day. This can be achieved by decreasing the amount of calories ingested or by exercise. Reducing a person’s caloric intake by 500 calories is often difficult, as is increasing metabolism by an additional 500 calories/day by exercise (accomplished by a 45-min- ute jog, playing tennis for an hour, or a brisk walk for 1.25 hours). The most sensible approach to weight loss is to both decrease caloric intake and increase energy expenditure through exercise. Most individuals begin to lose weight if they decrease their caloric intake below 1500 calories/day and exercise for 15 to 20 minutes three to four times a week. Starvation and crash diets usually result in rapid weight loss (largely muscle and water) but cause rebound weight gain. The most successful approach to weight loss is gradual weight reduc- tion (0.5–1 lb/week) by adopting long-standing dietary and lifestyle habits that promote health and the attainment and maintenance of ideal body weight. Exercise is critical to maintaining muscle mass and bone mineral density and preventing the accumulation of visceral fat both during active weight loss as well as after weight loss has been achieved.50,51 Although many obese individuals may require the loss of con- siderable weight to achieve their long-term goals, it is important to stress that even modest reductions in body weight can produce signif- icant health benefits. For example, a 5% to 10% reduction in weight is accompanied by clinically meaningful improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose, and other health indices. In 2017 a systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 randomized controlled trials published in BMJ found that weight-loss interventions (which

## Behavioral Therapy

Although clinical studies indicate that behavioral approaches to the management of obesity are often successful in achieving clinically significant weight loss, the lost weight is generally regained. The great majority of patients return to their pretreatment weight within years. In order to provide the best insights on effective interventions, it is important to examine the psychological characteristics of people who have lost significant amounts of weight and regain only minimal weight.53 Three main behavioral characteristics have been identified in individuals who avoid regaining significant weight: • High levels of physical activity (approximately 1 hour daily) • Eating a low-calorie, low-fat, low-glycemic diet • Eating breakfast regularly • Self-monitoring weight • Maintaining a consistent eating pattern across weekdays and week- ends • Avoiding depression These characteristics are intertwined within a whole host of additional factors that provide the necessary leverage for successful weight loss. For example, most patients presenting for treatment of obesity want to lose 20% to 30% of their initial body weight. Because only modest weight loss is generally achieved, many patients quickly lose the motivation and determination to keep the weight off. However, if there is a significant boost to self-esteem and self-confidence, as well as improved appearance, the feeling of being more attractive, and being able to wear more fashion- able clothing, it can provide a tremendous impetus for continued weight loss until the initial goals are achieved or weight loss is maintained. It is important to remember that the majority of people want to lose weight for the sake of changes in their physical appearance, not for the health benefits. Although there is widespread awareness that being overweight is associated with increased health risks, the reality is that relatively few patients give this as their reason for seeking treatment. Identifying the primary goals of weight loss in patients is a key step in helping them achieve success.

## Dietary Strategies

The dietary strategy that we recommend for obesity is the same as that given in Chapter 44. The principles and goals detailed there reinforce A BC Fig. 201.6 Interaction between body-mass index (BMI) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in estimating the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). (From Lee DH, Porta M, Jacobs DR Jr, et al. Chlorinated persistent organic pollutants, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Endocr Rev. 2014 Aug;35[4]:557–601. PMID: 24483949.)

some of the key goals of weight loss and the maintenance of ideal body weight. The importance of adequate protein consumption should be stressed. We recommend 2.0 g of protein per 2 lb body weight unless a patient is showing signs of renal failure. In 2017 an analysis of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was published, in which approximately 3000 individuals were randomized to either placebo, metformin, or intensive lifestyle intervention (a low-calorie, low-fat diet combined with at least 150 minutes moderate exercise per week) for 1 year. In all three groups, higher carbohydrate intake at baseline was associated with lower body weight. Furthermore, at the conclusion of the trial, increasing carbohydrate intake (in the context of calorie reduction) was strongly associated with weight loss in the lifestyle group (and to a lesser degree in the placebo group). A greater intake of dietary fiber was also strongly associated with weight loss in all three groups, leading the authors to conclude that “in the context of overall calorie reduction, a dietary shift toward greater car- bohydrate and lower fat intake, specifically increasing the intake of dietary fiber, fruits, and vegetables, promotes weight loss in individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.” Note that the carbohydrates as reported in this study are not simple sugars but primarily from food sources.54 The importance of higher protein consumption was demonstrated in the Diogenes study. The name Diogenes is an acronym standing for “Diet, Obesity and Genes.” This 5-year program involved a consor- tium of 29 world-class centers in diet and health studies, epidemiol- ogy, dietary genomics, and food technology across Europe. Over overweight adults from eight European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with an 800-calorie diet were randomly assigned to one of five ad libitum diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: a low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low- protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic- index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet. The dropout rate was the highest in the group assigned to both a low protein and a high glycemic index diet (37.4%, compared with 26.4% in those assigned to either of the high protein diet groups and 25.6% in those assigned to either of the low glycemic index groups). The mean initial weight loss with the low-calorie diet was 11 kg. In the analysis of participants who completed the study, only the low- protein and high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain (1.67 kg). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the weight regain was 0.93 kg less in the groups assigned to a high-pro- tein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet and 0.95 kg less in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to diet-related adverse events.55

## Water

It is well established that water consumption can acutely reduce caloric intake at mealtimes, especially among middle-aged and older adults. In the most recent study, 48 adults aged 55 to 75 years with a BMI between 25 and 40 were assigned to one of two groups: (1) a hypocaloric diet with 500 mL water before each daily meal (water group) or (2) a hypo- caloric diet alone (nonwater group). Weight loss was approximately kg greater in the water group than in the nonwater group, and the water group showed a 44% greater decline in weight over the 12 weeks than the nonwater group. Thus, when combined with a hypocaloric diet, consuming 500 mL water before each main meal leads to greater weight loss than a hypocaloric diet alone in middle-aged and older adults.56

## The Atkins Diet

Although literally hundreds of fad diets have been promoted over the years, we would be remiss if we did not mention the most famous weight-loss diet of all time—the “Atkins Diet.” This high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet was developed by Robert Atkins during the 1960s. In the early 1990s, Atkins brought his diet back into the nutrition spotlight with the publication of his best-selling book Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolution. An estimated 50 million people or more worldwide have tried the Atkins Diet, which emphasizes the consump- tion of protein and fat. Individuals following the Atkins Diet are per- mitted to eat unlimited amounts of all meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and most cheeses. The Atkins Diet is divided into four phases: induction, ongoing weight loss, premaintenance, and maintenance. During the induction phase (the first 14 days of the diet), carbohydrate intake is limited to no more than 20 g per day. No fruit, bread, grains, starchy vegetables, or dairy products except cheese, cream, and butter are allowed during this phase. During the ongoing weight-loss phase, dieters experiment with various levels of carbohydrate consumption until they determine the most liberal level of carbohydrate intake that allows them to con- tinue to lose weight. Dieters are encouraged to maintain this level of carbohydrate intake until their weight loss goals are met. Then, during the premaintenance and maintenance phases, dieters determine the level of carbohydrate consumption that allows them to maintain their weight. To avoid regaining weight, dieters must stick to this level of carbohydrate consumption, perhaps for the rest of their lives. Although we agree with the underlying principle of the Atkins Diet, that diets high in sugar and refined carbohydrates cause weight gain and ultimately lead to obesity, we disagree with the more extreme interpretations of application. One of the big reasons why the Atkins Diet is so attractive to dieters who have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight on low-fat, low-calorie diets is that while on the Atkins Diet, they can eat as many calories as desired from protein and fat as long as carbohydrate consumption is restricted. Therefore many Atkins diet- ers are spared the feelings of hunger and deprivation that accompany other weight-loss regimens. However, we do not agree that such an incomplete diet is conducive to long-term health. In addition, the lack of differentiation between healthy and unhealthy high-protein/high- fat foods, in the long run, is not an effective approach to eating. This likely helps explain the limited benefits found, as discussed herein. Despite its enormous popularity, the Atkins program was not eval- uated in a proper clinical trial until 2003. In this initial study, although people following the Atkins Diet did experience initial weight loss— although likely as a result of water loss rather than true fat loss—in the long run, they gained it all back, plus more. In the study, 63 obese men and women were randomly assigned to the Atkins Diet or a low-calo- rie, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Professional contact was minimal, so as to replicate the approach used by most dieters. Although subjects on the Atkins Diet had lost more weight than subjects on the conven- tional diet at 6 months, the difference at 12 months was not significant. Adherence was poor, and attrition was high in both groups.57 Since this initial clinical evaluation, other studies have shown simi- lar results. For example, in one study of 34 adults with impaired glucose tolerance, 12 weeks of a low-fat (18% of total calories), high–complex carbohydrate (more than 62% of total calories) diet alone (High-CHO) or paired with an aerobic exercise training program (High-CHO + Ex) was compared with the effects of an Atkin’s-style diet (41% fat, 14% protein, 45% carbohydrate of total calories; the control group). Fiber intake averaged 58 to 61 g/day in the two high-carbohydrate groups versus 18.5 g/day in the control group. In the High-CHO + Ex group, participants engaged in aerobic exercise for 45 minutes a day, 4 days per week, at 80% of peak oxygen consumption. All participants were instructed to consume food ad libitum. Although caloric intake was similar in all three groups, both High-CHO groups (with and with- out exercise) lost more weight (mean loss 10.5 lb with exercise and

lb without exercise than the control group (mean loss: a fraction of lb). Similarly, a higher percentage of body fat was lost by the High- CHO + Ex (3.5%) group and the High-CHO without exercise group (2.2%) than by controls (0.2% increase in body fat). Thigh fat area also decreased significantly in both of the High-CHO groups but not in the control group. The resting metabolic rate and rate of fat oxidation were not decreased in the High-CHO or control groups.58 In another study, 132 obese adults (BMI >35), of whom 83% had type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, were counseled to consume either an Atkins-like diet limited to less than 30 g of carbohydrates per day or to a diet restricted by 500 kcal per day with less than 30% of these calories coming from fat. Although initially the Atkins Diet did promote weight loss during the first 6-month period, this effect began to disappear during the second 6-month period. At 12 months, the difference between average weight loss in the two groups was no longer statistically significant (11 lb in the Atkins group vs. 7 lb in the low-fat group), although changes in triglyceride levels favored the Atkins Diet (−57 mg/dL vs. +4 mg/dL), as did reductions in hemoglobin A 1c (−0.7 vs. −0.1%) in the patients with type 2 diabetes.59 Another study worth commenting on was funded by the Atkins Foundation. In this study, 120 overweight but otherwise healthy adult subjects with elevated lipid levels followed either the Atkins Diet or a diet containing fewer than 30% calories from fat, 10% or fewer calories from saturated fat, less than 300 mg cholesterol, and a deficit of to 1000 calories. At 24 weeks, the Atkins group had lost a mean of lb versus a mean loss of 14 lb in the reduced-fat group. Triglyceride levels fell more in the Atkins group (−74 mg/dL) than in the restrict- ed-fat group (+28 mg/dL) as well, and high-density-lipoprotein cho- lesterol (HDL-C) levels increased in the Atkins group (by 5.5 mg/dL) and decreased in the low-fat group (by 1.6 mg/dL). The main criticism of this study was that the “low-fat” group received almost 30% of their caloric intake from fat, and the dietitians administering the dietary recommendations made no clear attempt to significantly restrict sugar and refined carbohydrates. Thus the control diet with which the Atkins Diet was compared was significantly less than ideal.60 In 2014 a systematic review and meta-analysis of low-carbohydrate diets (vs. isoenergetic balanced diets) found little to no difference in weight loss between the two diet types at both 3 to 6 months and to 2 years. Additionally, this analysis of 19 trials and over 3000 par- ticipants found little or no difference in cardiovascular risk factors among overweight/obese participants at 2 years, follow-up, including lipids, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, both among diabetics and nondiabetics.61 The findings from these clinical trials indicate that although adher- ing strictly to the Atkins Diet (dramatically reducing carbohydrate intake while allowing free access to high-fat and high-protein foods) sometimes leads to more weight loss in the first 6 months, eating a more healthful diet, as described in Chapter 44, is associated with equal efficacy in the long run and is considerably more health-promoting. In some but not all trials, the low-carbohydrate diet was associated with a greater improvement in some risk factors, but this benefit was not maintained. On the basis of the current evidence, we do not recom- mend the Atkins Diet. Furthermore, because the high protein content of the Atkins Diet places stress on the liver and kidneys, we do not recommend it for anyone with impaired liver or kidney function.

## Natural Weight-Loss Aids

Several natural weight loss aids can be useful in helping either to reduce appetite or enhance metabolism. In decreasing order of efficacy, we rate these items as follows: • Meal-replacement formulas • Fiber supplements • Chromium • Medium-chain triglycerides • Hydroxycitrate • 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)

## Meal-Replacement Formulas

Meal-replacement formulas are a popular weight-loss strategy, and their effectiveness has been confirmed in several clinical trials.62–65 In these studies, dietary compliance and convenience were viewed more favorably by participants who consumed meal-replacement (MR) for- mulas than by those in a conventional weight-loss program. Ideally, these formulations should provide high-quality nutrition; they should be high in protein and low in glycemic load and high in viscous, soluble fiber. A protein target of 2.2 g protein/kg lean body mass (LBM) per day produces greater fat loss than 1.1 g protein/kg LBM per day.66 Medifast is a popular physician-supervised weight-loss program that relies heavily on MR formulas. In one 40-week randomized con- trolled clinical trial that included 90 obese adults with a BMI between 30 and 50, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two weight- loss programs for 16 weeks and then followed for a 24-week period of weight maintenance. The dietary interventions consisted of an MR program (Medifast) or a self-selected isocaloric food-based (FB) meal plan. The Medifast plan included 5 MRs (90–110 kcal/each), 5 to oz lean protein, 1½ cups of nonstarchy vegetables, and up to two fat servings daily (providing 800–1000 kcal). The MRs used in this study were low in fat, low in glycemic index (GI), and low in sugar, provid- ing a balanced ratio of carbohydrates to proteins; they were based on either soy and/or whey protein. The food-based plan included 3 oz of grains, 1 cup of vegetables, 1 cup of fruit, 2 cups of milk, 5 to 7 oz of lean protein, and 3 tsp of fat daily (providing about 1000 kcal/day). The FB group was also instructed to take a multivitamin and additional calcium to ensure that micronutrient needs were met. Weight loss at 16 weeks was significantly better in the Medifast group (MD) versus the FB group, 12.3% versus 6.9%, respectively. Significantly more of the MD participants lost 5% or more of their initial weight at week (93% vs. 55%) and week 40 (62% vs. 30%). Significant improvements in body composition were also observed in MD participants compared with those in the FB group at weeks 16 and 40. At week 40, a mean body-fat percentage decrease in the MD group was 2.9%, whereas the FB group decreased by 1.8%. Moreover, lean muscle mass as a percent- age of total weight was significantly increased by 4.5% from baseline to week 40 in the MD group, whereas the FB group did not experi- ence any significant change. Blood pressure also dropped. At week 40, systolic blood pressure had dropped by 6.0 mm Hg (4.5%) in the MD group and 8.3 mm Hg in the FB group. Diastolic blood pressure was decreased by 5.5 mm Hg (6.2%) in the MD group and 0.9 mm Hg (0.45%) in the FB group. One advantage for the FB group was in the reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP). At week 40, CRP levels in the FB group decreased by a mean of 4.1 (30.1%), whereas in the MD group they decreased by a mean of 3.1 (40.7%).67

## Fiber Supplements

A tremendous amount of clinical evidence indicates that increasing the amount of dietary fiber promotes weight loss. The best supplemental fiber sources for weight loss are PGX (see following discussion), gluco- mannan, gum karaya, psyllium, chitin, guar gum, and pectin because they are viscous, water-soluble fibers. When taken with water before meals, these fiber sources bind to the water in the stomach to form a gelatinous mass that induces a sense of satiety. As a result, individuals are less likely to overeat. The benefits of fiber go well beyond this mechanical effect, how- ever. Fiber supplements have been shown to enhance blood sugar

## 1618SECTION 6 Diseases

control, decrease insulin levels, and reduce the number of calories absorbed by the body. In some of the clinical studies demonstrating weight loss, fiber supplements were shown to reduce the number of calories absorbed by 30 to 180 per day. Although modest, this reduc- tion in calories would, over the course of a year, result in a 3- to 18-lb weight loss.68,69 Several studies have used guar gum, a water-soluble fiber obtained from the Indian cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba), with good results (Table 201.3).70–81 In one study, nine women weighing between 160 and 242 lb were given 10 g of guar gum immediately before lunch and dinner. They were told not to consciously alter their eating habits. After 2 months, the women reported an average weight loss of 9.4 lb. Reductions were also noted for cholesterol and triglyceride levels.70 Studies with soluble fiber in the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels have shown a dose-dependent effect.68,69 Dietary fiber supple- ments appear to exert a dose-dependent effect in weight-loss studies as well. Therefore, to achieve the greatest benefit, the dosage should be as high as possible. Because water-soluble fibers are fermented by intes- tinal bacteria, a great deal of gas can be produced, leading to increased flatulence and abdominal discomfort. Patients should be advised to start out with a dosage between 1 and 2 g before meals and at bedtime and to gradually increase the dosage to 5 g. Several studies have used PGX (PolyGlycopleX), a novel natural polysaccharide matrix composed of three natural compounds (gluco- mannan, alginate, and xanthan gum) combined in a proprietary pro- cess that leads them to coalesce and form an entirely new matrix that is the most viscous fiber known to date.82,83 Detailed clinical studies have now shown PGX to exert the following benefits: • Reduce appetite and promote effective weight loss84,85 • Increase the level of compounds that block the appetite and pro- mote satiety86 • Decrease the level of compounds that stimulate overeating84 • Reduce postprandial (after-meal) and delayed (second meal) post- prandial blood glucose levels when added to or taken with foods87,88 • Reduce the glycemic index of any food or beverage by 15% to 70%87,88 • Increase insulin sensitivity and decrease blood insulin levels89 • Stabilize blood sugar control in the overweight and obese individuals • Lower blood cholesterol and triglycerides84,85 A 2017 three-arm, 12-week clinical study using rice bran as the con- trol showed that the granule form of PGX was the most effective in terms of weight loss, decreased waist size, and interestingly, reduced number of meals a day.90 PGX is available in a soft gelatin capsule, as granules to be added into food and beverages, and in a meal-replacement drink mix. The typical dosage is 2.5 to 5 g before each meal. PGX has an excellent safety profile.91 As with other sources of dietary fiber, to avoid minor side effects—such as increased gas, bloating, loose stools, or constipa- tion—it is best to start with small amounts and then gradually increase the dosage within a few days to a week. Clinical experience and studies suggest the granules are less expensive, are more effective, and achieve better patient compliance.

## Chromium

One of the key goals for enhancing weight loss is to increase the sen- sitivity of body cells to insulin. Chromium plays a key role in cellu- lar sensitivity to insulin. In some clinical studies in individuals with diabetes, supplementing the diet with chromium has been shown to decrease fasting glucose levels, improve glucose tolerance, lower insulin levels, and decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels while also increasing the levels of HDL-C (see Chapter 165). Chromium supple- mentation has been demonstrated to lower body weight yet increase lean body mass, presumably as a result of increased insulin sensitivity. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials found that chromium supple- mentation generated statistically significant reductions in body weight, although the effects were small, indicating that chromium alone is unlikely to produce meaningful results but should be combined with other therapies.92 In one study, patients were given chromium bound to picolinic acid (chromium picolinate) in one of three doses daily for 2.5 months: placebo, 200 mcg, or 400 mcg.93 Patients taking the 200- and 400-mcg doses lost an average of 4.2 lb of fat. The group taking the placebo lost only 0.4 lb. Even more impressive was the fact that the chromium groups gained more muscle (1.4 vs. 0.2 lb) than those taking the placebo. The results were most striking in elderly subjects and in men. The men taking chromium picolinate lost more than seven times the amount of body fat as those taking the placebo (7.7 vs. 1 lb). However, an increase in lean body weight percentage with chromium supplementation may be limited to men; two clinical trials in women involved in an exercise program did not show any significant changes in body composition with chromium supplementation.94,95 The 400-mcg dosage is more effective than the 200-mcg dosage (Table 201.4).

recent studies with chromium picolinate at dosages of 1000 mcg/day did not show any benefits, indicating that the effect of chromium is probably limited to restoring and maintaining optimal tissue concen- trations of chromium versus any pharmacological effect.96,97 Higher dosages are not likely to show any greater effect than 400 mcg daily.

## Medium-Chain Triglycerides

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are saturated fats (extracted from coconut oil) that range in length from 6 to 12 carbon chains. MCTs are used by the body differently from the long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), which are the most abundant fats found in nature. LCTs are the storage fats for both humans and plants and range in length from 18 to 24 car- bons. This difference in length makes a substantial difference in how MCTs and LCTs are metabolized. Unlike regular fats, MCTs appear to promote weight loss rather than weight gain. MCTs may promote weight loss by increasing thermogenesis and energy expenditure.98,99 In contrast, the LCTs are usually stored in the fat deposits, and because their energy is conserved, a high-fat diet tends to decrease the metabolic rate. In one study, the thermogenic effect of a high-calorie diet containing 40% fat as MCTs was compared with one containing 40% fat as LCTs. The thermogenic effect (calories wasted 6 hours after a meal) of the MCTs was almost twice as high as that of the LCTs—120 versus 66 calories. The researchers concluded that the excess energy provided by fats in the form of MCTs would not be efficiently stored as fat but rather wasted as heat.101 A second study demonstrated that MCT oil given over a 6-day period can increase diet-induced thermogenesis by 50%.102 In another study, researchers compared single meals of 400 calories composed entirely of MCTs or LTCs.103 The thermic effect of MCTs over 6 hours was three times greater than that of LCTs. In addition, whereas the LCTs elevated blood fat levels by 68%, MCTs had no effect on the blood fat level. Researchers concluded that the substitution of MCTs for LCTs would produce weight loss as long as the caloric level remained the same. In one double-blind study, 101 hypertriacylglycerolemic subjects were randomly assigned to ingest 25 to 30 g/day of MCT or LCT oil as the only cooking oil for 8 consecutive weeks. Compared with subjects having BMIs between 24 and 28 in the LCT group, corresponding subjects in the MCT group showed significantly greater decreases in body weight, BMI, body fat, waist circumference (WC), ratio of WC to hip circumference (HC), total fat area and subcutaneous fat area in the abdomen, as well as blood triglycerides and low-density-lipopro- tein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at week 8.104 A 2015 meta-analysis of 13 trials found that compared with LCTs, MCTs reduced weight (by approximately 1 lb) and were associated with other improvements in body composition, including lower waist and hip circumference and total body and visceral fat (although pointing out that larger trials from independent funding sources are needed).105 In order to gain the benefit from MCTs, a diet must remain low in LCTs. MCTs can be used as oils for salad dressing, bread spreads, or simply taken as supplements. A good dosage recommendation for MCTs is 1 to 2 tbsp/day. Patients with diabetes and individuals with liver disease should be monitored closely when using MCTs because they may develop ketoacidosis.

## Hydroxycitrate

Hydroxycitrate (HCA) is a natural substance isolated from the fruit of the Malabar tamarind (Garcinia cambogia). This is a yellowish fruit about the size of an orange with a thin skin and deep furrows, similar to an acorn squash. It is native to southern India, where it is dried and used extensively in curries. The dried fruit contains about 30% hydroxycitric acid. HCA has been shown to be a powerful lipogenic inhibitor in ani- mals.106,107 Whether or not it demonstrates this effect in humans has not yet been proven. The weight-loss–promoting effects in animals are perhaps best exemplified in a study that shows HCA producing a “significant reduction in food intake, and body weight gain” in rats.108 HCA may not only be a powerful inhibitor of fat production but also an appetite suppressant. It is critical, when using an HCA formula, that a low-fat diet be maintained because HCA only inhibits the conversion of carbohydrates into fat. By itself, HCA may offer a safe, natural aid for weight loss when taken at a dosage of 1500 mg three times daily. In two clinical trials, a total of 90 moderately obese subjects (ages 21–50, BMI >26) were randomly divided into three groups. Group A was administered HCA 4667 mg; group B was administered a combination of HCA 4667 mg, niacin-bound chromium 4 mg, and Gymnema sylvestre extract 400 mg; and group C was given a placebo daily in three equally divided doses 30 to 60 minutes before meals. All subjects were provided with a diet of 2000 kcal/day and participated in a supervised walking program for min/day, 5 days/week. Eighty-two subjects completed the study. At the end of 8 weeks, both body weight and BMI decreased by 5.4% in group A; LDL-C and triglycerides were reduced by 12.9% and 6.9%, respec- tively; HDL-C levels increased by 8.9%; serum leptin levels decreased by 38%; serotonin levels increased by 44.5%; and urinary excretion of fat metabolites increased by 32% to 109%. Group B demonstrated sim- ilar beneficial changes, but generally to a greater extent. Specifically, group B reduced body weight and BMI by 7.8% and 7.9%, respectively; food intake was reduced by 14.1%; total cholesterol, LDL-C, and tri- glyceride levels were reduced by 9.1%, 17.9%, and 18.1%, respectively; and HDL-C and serotonin levels increased by 20.7% and 50%, respec- tively. Serum leptin levels decreased by 40.5%, and enhanced excretion of urinary fat metabolites increased by 146% to 281%. No significant adverse effects were observed in either trial.109 Close attention to prod- uct quality may be particularly important because a number of safety concerns have emerged, specifically for hepatotoxicity. These appear to be limited to specific products containing numerous ingredients in addition to HCA (Hydroxycut has been named by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] as a possible hepatotoxin). Furthermore, some concerns have been raised about the potential for elevated sero- tonin levels, so caution should be used in those patients taking sero- tonin-elevating medications.110

## 5-Hydroxytryptophan

More than three decades ago, researchers demonstrated that the administration of 5-HTP to rats genetically bred to overeat and be obese resulted in a significant reduction in food intake. Further research revealed that these rats had decreased activity of tryptophan hydroxylase, which converts tryptophan to 5-HTP, itself subsequently converted to serotonin. In other words, these rats were fat as a result of a genetically determined low level of activity of the enzyme that starts the manufacture of serotonin from tryptophan. Hence, these rats never got the message to stop eating until they had consumed far greater

amounts of food than normal rats. Circumstantial evidence indicates that many humans are also genetically predisposed to obesity, a predis- position that may involve the same mechanism as that in rats geneti- cally predisposed to obesity (i.e., decreased conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP and, as a result, decreased serotonin levels). By providing preformed 5-HTP, this genetic defect is bypassed, and more serotonin is manufactured. (For a complete discussion of this interesting nutri- ent, see Chapter 87.) The early animal studies with 5-HTP as a weight-loss aid have been followed by a series of three human clinical studies in overweight women.111–113 The first study showed that 5-HTP was able to reduce caloric intake and promote weight loss despite the fact that the women made no conscious effort to lose weight.111 The average amount of weight lost during the 5-week period of 5-HTP supplementation was a little more than 3 lb. The second study sought to determine whether 5-HTP helped overweight individuals adhere to dietary recommendations.111 This 12-week study was divided into two 6-week periods. For the first weeks, there were no dietary recommendations, and for the second weeks, the women were placed on a 1200-calorie diet. As shown in Table 201.5, the women taking the placebo lost 2.28 lb, whereas the women taking the 5-HTP lost 10.34 lb. As in the previous study, 5-HTP appeared to promote weight loss by promoting satiety, leading to the consumption of fewer calories at meals. All the women taking 5-HTP reported early satiety. The third study with 5-HTP was similar to the second study: for the first 6 weeks, there were no dietary restrictions, and for the second 6 weeks, the women were placed on a diet of 1200 calories per day.113 The group receiving the 5-HTP lost an average of 4.39 lb after the first 6 weeks and an average of 11.63 lb after 12 weeks. In comparison, the placebo group lost an average of only 0.62 lb after the first 6 weeks and 1.87 lb after 12 weeks. The lack of weight loss during the second 6-week period in the placebo group obviously reflects the fact that the women had difficulty adhering to the diet. Early satiety was reported by 100% of the subjects during the first 6-week period. During the second 6-week period, even with severe caloric restriction, 90% of the women taking 5-HTP reported early satiety. Many of the women receiving the 5-HTP (300 mg three times daily) reported mild nausea during the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the symptom was never severe enough for any of the women to drop out of the study. No other side effects were reported.

## Detox Support

Given the large role toxins appear to play in obesity and the meta- bolic and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with it, as well as the increased toxin release into the bloodstream during weight loss, providing support for detoxification pathways during weight loss seems warranted (see Chapter 35, Environmental Medicine, for more detailed discussion). Support for glutathione conjugation appears par- ticularly important because glutathione is known to be depleted by POP exposure and is necessary for the conjugation and elimination of many POPs, including PCBs and organochlorine pesticides.114 Indeed, serum γ -glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels have been suggested as one possible biomarker for POP exposure and have been shown to mod- ulate the influence of BMI on impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Data from over 6000 participants in the Fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that those with a BMI over had approximately a 1.5-fold increase in the prevalence of IFG if they were in the lowest tertile of GGT. However, in the highest tertile of GGT, that risk jumped to approximately fivefold (see Fig. 201.7).

## 1621CHAPTER 201 Obesity

In addition to supporting glutathione production, enhancing toxin elimination should also be emphasized. This may be done with the use of supplemental fiber to prevent enterohepatic recirculation of these toxins, and emerging evidence suggests it may also be done with sauna therapy. A number of compounds, including PCBs and phthalates, have been shown to be released into the sweat, and the amount of sweat loss during sauna therapy may be directly related to BMI.115–116


A successful program for weight loss must be consistent with the four cornerstones of good health: • Proper diet • Adequate exercise • A positive mental attitude • The right support for the body through natural measures All of these components are critical and interrelated.


The recommendations given in Chapter 44 should be followed. Adequate protein is very important, 2 g per kg of body weight. Emphasis should be placed on calorie reduction, with the intake of healthy complex carbohydrates—especially those rich in fiber—pos- itively associated with weight loss over time.

## Psychological Support

Referral to counseling should be considered. Overweight indi- viduals tend to suffer heavy assaults on their self-esteem and self-image.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lifestyle

Exercise is absolutely critical to an effective weight-loss program. Recommendations are given in Chapter 36. Supplements: • Viscous, soluble fiber (e.g., PGX): 2.5 to 5 g before meals • 5-HTP: begun at 50 to 100 mg 20 minutes before meals for 2 weeks and then doubled (to a maximum of 300 mg) if weight loss is less than 1 lb/week. Higher dosages of 5-HTP (e.g., 300 mg) are associ- ated with nausea, but this symptom disappears after 6 weeks of use. • Chromium: 200 to 400 mcg/day • Medium-chain triglycerides: 1 to 2 tbsp incorporated into the diet • Glutathione support: N-acetylcysteine 600 mg twice per day

## 1623CHAPTER 202 Osteoarthritis

• Trauma (e.g., obesity, fractures along joint surfaces, surgery, exces- sive playing of basketball at an older age) • Crystal deposition • Presence of abnormal cartilage • Previous inflammatory disease of the joint (e.g., rheumatoid arthri- tis, gout, septic arthritis) Box 202.1 summarizes the many factors involved in the pathogen- esis of OA. One of the most interesting clinical features of OA is the lack of correlation between its severity as determined by a radiograph and the degree of pain. In some cases, the joint appears normal, with little if any joint-space narrowing, yet the pain can be excruciating. Conversely, there are cases in which there is tremendous deformity yet little, if any, pain. In fact, about 40% of individuals with the worst x-ray classification for OA are pain-free.4 The exact cause of the pain in OA is still not well defined, but there are numerous potential causes (Box 202.2). Depression and anxiety appear to increase the experience of the pain of OA.

## 1624SECTION 6 Diseases


The onset of OA can be subtle. Morning joint stiffness is often the first symptom. As the disease progresses, pain on motion of the involved joint is worsened by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. There are usually no obvious signs of inflammation. The specific clinical picture varies with the joint involved. Disease of the hands leads to pain and limitation of use. Knee involvement produces pain, swelling, and instability. OA of the hip causes local pain and a limp. Spinal OA (which is common) may result in compression of nerves and blood vessels, causing pain and vascular insufficiency. The classic presentation of OA is easy to distinguish from other arthritides, especially RA, which is usually associated with much more inflammation of surrounding soft tissues. After a detailed medical his- tory and physical examination, the best diagnostic tool to confirm the diagnosis of OA is a radiograph of the suspected joint. The classic find- ing in joints affected with OA is joint-space narrowing, loss of cartilage, and the presence of bone spurs (osteophytes). Box 202.3 lists import- ant causes of the misdiagnosis of OA.


Data collected from the earliest lesions to the most advanced stages of clinical OA suggest that the cellular and tissue response is purposeful and aimed at repair of the anatomical defects. The process contribut- ing to OA appears to be arrestable and sometimes reversible. The key factor in OA is increased catabolism in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the articular cartilage. Cellular senescence due to aging, increased expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, and nutrient deficiency are all important contributors to OA development. The major therapeutic goal is to prevent this increased catabolism of the ECM and to ultimately enhance its repair as well as that of the articular connective tissue cells.5,6 Several studies have attempted to determine the “natural course” of OA.6,7 One group of researchers studied the course of OA of the hip over a 10-year period. All subjects had pseudocystic changes suggestive of advanced OA, yet the researchers reported marked clinical improve- ment and radiological recovery of the joint space in 14 of 31 hips.7 The authors purposely applied no therapy and regarded their results as reflecting the natural course of the disease. These results, as well as others, raise the serious concern that some medical interventions may promote disease progression.


Bone tissue is highly sensitive to many types of toxic substances. For exam- ple, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) stored in adipose tissue can be related to differentiation, metabolism, and function in adipose tissue and may therefore be involved in the relation between obesity and OA.8 In women, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), nondioxin-like PCBs, and organochlorine (OC) pesticides are positively associated with arthritis.9 Animal studies show 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) inhibits tibial growth, and 3,3’,4,4’,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB- 126) impairs mineralization and reduces the collagen content in ovariec- tomized rats.10 Lead has complex effects on bone cell function, including altering the plasma levels of calciotropic hormones, perturbing calcium-mediated and other sensitive signal transduction pathways, uncoupling osteo- blasts and osteoclasts from normal paracrine control by interfering with hormone processes, and biochemically inhibiting enzymes resulting in altered cellular energetics. In lead-intoxicated children, blood levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 are reduced to levels comparable to those of patients with metabolic bone disease.11

## Conventional Pharmacological Treatment

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have become the main treatment of OA in conventional medicine. Although these drugs provide short-term symptomatic relief, they may increase the rate of degeneration of the joint cartilage. Experimental studies have shown that aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit collagen matrix synthesis and accelerate the destruction of cartilage.12 Some retrospective clinical studies have shown that NSAID use is associated with acceleration of OA and increased joint destruction.13–16 Simply stated, NSAIDs appear to suppress the symptoms but accelerate the progression of OA. Furthermore, a patient is unlikely to die of OA, but NSAID use is asso- ciated with significant risk for mortality. With older NSAIDs, the risk is primarily related to gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas the newer cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) are associated with an increase in cardiovascular events.

## Physical Therapy

Skewed musculoskeletal dynamics play a role in abnormally stress- ing involved joints. Despite this relatively simple concept, it is only recently that this idea has been researched. An 18-month study of patients with tibiofemoral osteophytes and at least some difficulty with knee-requiring activity revealed conclusively that patients with varus alignment had a fourfold increased risk of medial OA progression.17 Similarly, those with valgus alignment showed almost five times the risk of lateral OA progression. Not surprisingly, these researchers learned that the decline was greater for those with more extensive

misalignments. This clearly documents the importance of considering musculoskeletal dynamics in evaluating any subject presenting with OA. Those with misalignments may have to consider manual manipu- lation therapies, orthotics, and extremity adjustments, along with tech- niques such as regular massage therapy, to relax hypertonic muscles. From a prevention standpoint, assessing and treating younger individ- uals may also decrease the risk of OA later in life. In addition to addressing alignment issues, various physical therapy modalities (e.g., exercise, heat, cold, diathermy, ultrasound) are often beneficial in improving joint mobility and reducing pain in OA, espe- cially when administered regularly (Box 202.4). Much of the benefit of physical therapy is thought to be due to achieving proper hydration within the joint capsule. Clinical and experimental studies seem to indicate that short-wave diathermy may be of the greatest benefit.18–20 Combining short-wave diathermy therapy with periodic ice massage, rest, and appropriate exercises appears to be the most effective approach. Ultrasound and laser therapy have also been shown to be helpful.21,22 The best exercises are isometrics and swimming. These types of exercises increase circulation to the joint and strengthen surround- ing muscles without placing excess strain on joints. Increasing quad- riceps strength has been shown to improve the clinical features and reduce pain in OA of the knee.23 Walking programs help improve functional status and relieve pain in patients with OA of the knee.24 Patient-specific physical therapies may be useful as well. For example, four older adults with hand OA benefited from keyboard playing for minutes a day, 4 days a week.25

## Dietary and Exercise Considerations

Dietary therapy primarily involves the achievement of normal body weight and improved insulin sensitivity because excess weight means increased stress on weight-bearing joints affected with OA. Obesity is a major risk factor for OA of the knee, and there is also considerable evidence linking OA to metabolic syndrome because of the negative effects that insulin resistance, inflammatory adipokines, and other fea- tures of this syndrome have on inflammation and joint structures.26 Insulin stimulates chondrocytes to increase the synthesis and assembly of proteoglycans. Because the most prominent early change seen in the articular cartilage in OA is a decrease in both proteoglycan content and state of aggregation, insulin insensitivity or deficiency predisposes to OA. Weight reduction, possibly due to a combination of mechanical and physiological factors, reduces the risk for OA and has also been shown to reduce pain and improve cartilage function in existing OA, especially when combined with exercise.2,27–30 Lack of exercise decreases the hydration of the joint cartilages and retards the diffusion of nutrients into the affected area. When OA pain develops, sufferers often tend to reduce activity, which in turn decreases muscle strength. Greater muscle weakness increases joint wear, and inactivity can lead to weight gain, which can exacerbate OA, causing this cycle to repeat. In addition, patients with diabetes and cardiovascular concerns may also increase their risks for these illnesses as exercise diminishes. Weight loss and exercise have independently been effectively used to decrease the causative factors of OA and produce clinical improvement, but the best results are achieved by a combined approach. One study involved 252 obese elderly patients with a body-mass index of greater than 28 and radiographically confirmed OA who were randomized into healthy-lifestyle (control), diet-only, exercise-only, and diet-plus-ex- ercise groups.31 The exercise program involved hour-long sessions focusing on aerobics and resistance training three times a week. The goal of the dietary interventions was an average weight loss of 5% during the 18-month period. The most benefit was demonstrated in the diet-plus-exercise group. Compared with control patients and the diet-only group, subjects in the diet-plus-exercise group experi- enced a significant improvement in self-reported physical function, 6-minute walking distance, stair-climb times, and knee pain scores. Improvements in the exercise-only group were limited to the 6-minute walk distance.

# GENERAL DIETARY GUIDELINES

In general, the principles detailed in Chapter 44 are appropriate for OA. Otherwise, the “Mediterranean diet” seems prudent. Typically, this diet comprises abundant plant foods (including fruits, vegetables, whole-grain cereals, beans, nuts, and seeds); minimally processed sea- sonally fresh and locally grown foods; fish and poultry; olive oil as the main source of lipid; and dairy products, red meat, and wine in low to moderate amounts. Thus the diet is rich in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and oleic acid (omega-9 monounsatu- rated), antioxidant nutrients, and unrefined carbohydrates. A system- atic review of the scientific literature indicated the Mediterranean diet (MD) was associated with a lower prevalence of OA.31 Biomarkers of inflammation and cartilage degradation related to OA were also ana- lyzed, and there was decreased interleukin1- α in the MD group. One popular dietary practice in the treatment of OA, conceived by Childers, a horticulturist, is the elimination of foods from the Solanaceae family (nightshade family). Childers arrived at this method after finding that this simple dietary elimination cured his own OA.32 Childers developed a theory that genetically susceptible individuals might develop arthritis and other complaints from long-term low-level consumption of the Solanum alkaloids found in tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers, and tobacco. Presumably, these alkaloids inhibit normal collagen repair or promote inflammatory degeneration of the joints. Although yet unproven, it seems that this diet has been of ben- efit to some individuals.


Because Americans may spend more on natural remedies for OA than for any other medical condition, the practitioner should be well informed about the clinical effectiveness and safety of the various nat- ural options on the marketplace.

## Glucosamine Sulfate

Glucosamine sulfate has emerged as the most popular nutritional approach to OA. It is a simple molecule composed of glucose and an amine. Its main physiological effect on joints is to stimulate the man- ufacture of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Glucosamine also promotes the incorporation of sulfur into cartilage. It appears that as some

<!-- chunk -->

## 1626SECTION 6 Diseases

people age, they lose the ability to manufacture sufficient levels of glucosamine. The result is that cartilage loses its gel-like nature and ability to act as a shock absorber. The inability to manufacture glucos- amine may be the major factor leading to OA. Extensive preclinical and clinical research, including long-term double-blind studies, supports a rationale and role for glucosamine as a major consideration in the treatment of OA. This research and the clinical benefits of glucosamine sulfate in the treatment of OA are fully described in Chapter 83.

## Chondroitin Sulfate

Chondroitin sulfate, as well as shark cartilage, bovine cartilage extracts, and sea cucumber, contains a mixture of intact or partially hydrolyzed GAGs of molecular weights ranging from 14,000 to more than 30,000. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is composed of repeating units of derivatives of glucosamine sulfate with attached sugar molecules. Although the absorption rate of glucosamine sulfate is 90% to 98%, the absorption of intact chondroitin sulfate is estimated to be anywhere from 0% to 13%.33,34 The difference in absorption is largely due to the difference in size. Chondroitin sulfate is at least 50 to 300 times larger than glu- cosamine sulfate, too large to pass the normal intact intestinal bar- rier. If chondroitin sulfate molecules were absorbed intact or partially digested, they would still be unlikely to produce any significant benefit because the chondroitin sulfate molecules are too large to be delivered to cartilage cells. Furthermore, in patients with OA, levels of chondroi- tin sulfate in the synovial tissues are typically elevated.35 These absorp- tion problems suggest that any direct effect of these compounds in OA is highly unlikely. However, conflicting evidence supports the notion that exogenous chondroitin sulfate is indeed absorbed as a high-molecular- weight polysaccharide together with derivatives originating from a partial depolymerization, desulfation, or both.36–38 Any clinical benefit from chondroitin sulfate is most likely due to the absorption of sulfur or smaller GAG molecules broken down by the digestive tract. However, even this is controversial, because in one human study, 1 g of chondroitin sulfate failed to increase serum GAG concentration at all, based on a highly sensitive measure of intact or depolymerized GAG absorption. These results prompted the research- ers to conclude: “We suggest that chondroprotection by orally admin- istered chondroitin sulfate is a biologically and pharmacologically unfounded theory.”33 Pooled literature on the biochemistry of chondroitin sulfate offers enough information to assert that neither intact nor polymerized chondroitin sulfate is absorbed by the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Therefore no direct action of orally administered chondroitin sulfate on cartilage or chondrocytes is possible. Despite the unlikeliness of any direct action, two published meta-analyses indicate that chondroitin may be superior to placebo in reducing the pain of OA. One of these analyses may have been exag- gerated by publication bias related to the manufacturer’s sponsorship. The second meta-analysis did find chondroitin to be superior to pla- cebo in reducing the painful symptoms of OA, although these authors also called for trials of longer duration. Finally, one study using mg of chondroitin sulfate for two separate periods of 3 months over year did show decreased pain and improved knee function as well as a decrease in joint-space narrowing over placebo.39 This study reveals that even intermittent use of chondroitin may be effective. Another study seemed to point to the requirement of continuous long-term therapy as producing the best results. Patients with painful osteoarthri- tis of the knee were treated with oral chondroitin sulfate at a dose of either 260 mg/d (low-dose group, control group) or 1560 mg/d (high- dose group). Symptoms were evaluated by the Lequesne’s index and visual analog scale for pain. In a subgroup of 73 patients with severe symptoms (Lequesne’s index ≥ 8), the chondroitin sulfate dose of 1560 mg/d improved pain faster after 6 and 9 months of therapy com- pared with the low dosage.40 The other clinical studies that have been done with orally admin- istered chondroitin sulfate demonstrate that it is less effective than glucosamine sulfate.41–45 Furthermore, there is no evidence that using both glucosamine and chondroitin together is more effective than either alone.46 In general, the more impressive results have been achieved with glucosamine sulfate. Nevertheless, given the safety record of chondroitin and the evidence of modifying joint-space pathology, chondroitin is a reasonable addition to the glucosamine regimen of a patient with osteoarthritis. In addition, chondroitin sulfate may be acting in some indirect way in improving joint health.

## Hyaluronic Acid

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an important GAG in joints, providing a structural framework and supporting the ability of cartilage to hold water. A type of connective tissue, it is the actual “glue” that holds the body together. By the time most people reach the age of 70, the HA content of the body has dropped by 80% from when they were 40, predisposing them to the loss of connective tissue integrity, particu- larly of the skin and joints. Weekly injections of HA (Synvisc, Hyalgan, Supartz, etc.) into joints affected by OA (viscosupplementation) has been shown to be an effective treatment for OA, with beneficial effects on pain, function, and patient global assessment. Such results have been seen at different postinjection periods but especially at the 5- to 13-week postinjection period. Oral supplementation with HA has been shown to be a viable method of producing comparable results to intraarticular treat- ment.47–50 HA supplements feature HA derived from rooster combs, cow eyes, or bacterial fermentation. In the first double-blind study conducted with oral HA in OA, patients with knee OA were given either HA (80 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks.51 Compared with the placebo group, pain scores were signifi- cantly improved in the HA group. In another study, 60 patients with OA were randomized equally to receive either HA 200 mg, HA mg, or placebo for 8 weeks.47 After conducting a stratification anal- ysis on the subjects with more severe pain (i.e., those with a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] pain score >10), significant reductions in pain scores and total symptom scores were seen with the 200-mg dose but not with the 100-mg dose.

## Natural Eggshell Membrane

Natural eggshell membrane (NEM) provides GAGs, CS, and HA. NEM supports the body’s production of type II collagen, which is the main component of the cartilage that covers bones, particularly weight-bearing joints such as the knees and hips. NEM also boosts the production of GAGs. The clinical research on NEM began with a pilot study published in June 2009; patients with mild to moderate joint pain received mg NEM daily.52 After just 7 days, participants had an average 26% improvement in pain and a 28% improvement in flexibility. After days, they had an average 73% reduction in pain, with 45% of partic- ipants reporting they were completely pain-free. They also had a 44% improvement in flexibility and 76% less pain through their range of motion (ROM). No adverse side effects were reported. To further support the safety and efficacy of NEM in osteoarthritis, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted involv- ing 67 patients with OA of the knee.53 They received either 500 mg of NEM daily or a placebo. After only 10 days, those receiving NEM supplements had a 12% reduction in pain and 17% less stiffness. At the end of the 60-day trial, those receiving NEM had an average pain reduction of 15% and had 31% less stiffness. One third of the patients

## 1627CHAPTER 202 Osteoarthritis

receiving NEM experienced a reduction in pain of 40% or greater, and more than half had at least 50% less stiffness. No adverse side effects were reported. Additionally, 11 (single-arm trial) and 28 (double-arm trial) patients received oral NEM 500 mg once daily for 4 weeks.54 In the single-arm trial, supplementation with NEM produced a significant treatment response at 7 days for flexibility (27.8% increase) and at days for general pain (72.5% reduction), flexibility (43.7% increase), and ROM-associated pain (75.9% reduction). In the double-arm trial, supplementation with NEM produced a significant treatment response for pain at 7 days for both treatment arms (X: 18.4%, Y: 31.3% reduc- tion). There was no clinically meaningful difference between treatment arms at 7 days, so the Y arm crossed over to the X formulation for the remainder of the study. The significant treatment response continued through 30 days for pain (30.2% reduction). There were no adverse events reported.

## Niacinamide

In the 1940s and 1950s, William Kaufman, and later Abram Hoffer, reported good clinical results in the treatment of hundreds of patients with RA and OA using high-dose niacinamide (i.e., 900–4000 mg/ day in divided doses).55 Kaufman documented improvements in joint function, ROM, and increased muscle strength and endurance as well as a reduction in the sedimentation rate. Most patients achieved notice- able benefits within 1 to 3 months, with peak benefits noted between and 3 years of continuous use. These clinical results were evaluated in a well-designed double- blind, placebo-controlled trial.56 Seventy-two patients with OA were randomized for treatment with niacinamide (3000 mg daily in six divided doses) or placebo for 12 weeks. Outcome measures included global arthritis impact and pain, joint ROM and flexibility, erythro- cyte sedimentation rate (ESR), complete blood count, liver function tests, serum cholesterol, serum uric acid, and fasting blood sugar. The researchers found that niacinamide produced a 29% improvement in global arthritis impact compared with a 10% worsening in the placebo group. Pain levels did not change, but those on niacinamide reduced their NSAID use. Niacinamide supplementation reduced the ESR by 22% and increased joint mobility by 4.5 degrees over controls (8 degrees vs. 3.5 degrees); otherwise, there were no other changes in blood chemistry. Side effects, primarily mild gastrointestinal com- plaints, were more common in the niacinamide group but could be effectively managed by recommending that the pills be taken with food or fluids. Niacinamide at this high dose can result in significant side effects (e.g., glucose intolerance, liver damage) and therefore requires strict supervision.

## S-Adenosylmethionine

S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is an important physiological agent formed in the body by combining the essential amino acid methi- onine with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A deficiency of SAMe in the joint tissue, just like a deficiency of glucosamine, leads to loss of the gel-like nature and shock-absorbing qualities of carti- lage. A meta-analysis of 11 studies reports the benefits of SAMe in the treatment of OA by reducing pain and improving functional limitations.57 SAMe has been shown to be important in the manufacture of car- tilage components.58 In one double-blind study, supplemental SAMe increased cartilage formation as determined by magnetic resonance imaging in 14 patients with OA of the hands.59 In addition to this effect, SAMe has also demonstrated some mild pain-relieving and anti- inflammatory effects in animal studies. In total, 21,524 patients with OA have been treated with SAMe in published clinical trials. In double-blind trials, SAMe has demon- strated similar reductions in pain scores and clinical symptoms to NSAIDs like ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, and piroxicam. All of these studies indicate that SAMe offers significant advantages over NSAIDs. Although the drugs are associated with a significant risk of toxicity, side effects, and actual promotion of the disease process in OA, SAMe offers similar benefits with minimal risk or side effects. Side effects include occasional gastrointestinal disturbances, mainly diar- rhea.37 For more information, see Chapter 110.


Results from the Framingham Osteoarthritis Cohort Study indicate that a high intake of antioxidant nutrients, especially vitamin C, may reduce the risk of cartilage loss and disease progression in people with OA.36 A threefold reduction in the risk of OA progression was found in the middle and highest tertiles of vitamin C intake. These results high- light the importance of a diet rich in plant-based antioxidant nutrients protecting against chronic degenerative diseases, including OA. Deficient intake of vitamin C is common in the elderly, resulting in altered collagen synthesis and compromised connective tissue repair.60 Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that vitamin C has an ana- bolic effect on cartilage.61,62 Research has confirmed the importance, indeed necessity, for an excess of ascorbic acid in human chondrocyte protein synthesis.63 One in vivo study of experimental OA in guinea pigs found that cartilage erosion was much less, and the overall his- tological and biochemical changes in and around the OA joint much milder, in animals kept on high doses of vitamin C.60 A human study showed that a history of self-reported vitamin C supplementation indi- cated an effect in halting the progression of OA.64 Vitamins C and E appear to possess synergistic effects.60 The researchers concluded: “Thus, both vitamins E and C appear to enhance the stability of sulfated proteoglycans in the complex struc- ture comprising articular cartilage. Judicious use of these vitamins in the treatment of OA, either alone or in combination with other thera- peutic means, may thus be of great benefit to the patient population by retarding the erosion of cartilage.”


Vitamin D has a range of effects on cell types within osteoarthritis- affected joints acting through the vitamin D receptor and thus altering gene expression (Fig. 202.2). Several studies have shown that low serum levels of vitamin D 3 appear to be associated with an increased risk for the progression of OA, especially in people under 60 years of age.65,66 Four clinical studies have been conducted with vitamin D 3 supplementation in patients with OA.67 In a meta-analysis, these studies were judged to be of high quality. Table 202.2 shows the main features of these studies. The results indicated that vitamin D supple- mentation had a statistically significant but small-to-moderate effect on pain control in patients with knee OA. However, no effects were observed for the change in tibial cartilage volume or joint-space width. There was no difference seen between patients who had sufficient or insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels at baseline.

## Pantothenic Acid

An acute deficiency of pantothenic acid in the rat causes a pronounced failure of cartilage growth and eventually produces lesions similar to OA. Clinical improvement in OA symptomatology with the adminis- tration of 12.5 mg of pantothenic acid has been reported.68,69 Results often did not appear for 7 to 14 days. However, a larger double-blind study in patients with primarily RA displayed no significant benefit from the administration of 500 mg of pantothenic acid.70

## Vitamins A and E, Pyridoxine, Zinc, Copper, and Boron

Vitamins A and E, pyridoxine, zinc, copper, and boron are required for the synthesis of collagen and the maintenance of normal cartilage struc- tures. A deficiency of any one of these would allow accelerated joint degeneration. In addition, supplementation at appropriate levels may promote cartilage repair and synthesis. For example, boron supplemen- tation has been used in the treatment of OA in Germany since the mid- 1970s. This use was recently evaluated in a small double-blind clinical study and an open trial. In the double-blind study, of the patients given mg of boron (as sodium tetraborate decahydrate), 71% improved, com- pared with only 10% in the placebo group.71 In the open trial, boron sup- plementation (6–9 mg daily) produced effective relief in 90% of arthritis patients, including patients with OA, juvenile arthritis, and RA.72 The preliminary indication is that boron supplements are of value in arthritis, with many patients with OA experiencing complete resolution.

## Vitamin K

Studies have shown that low vitamin K status is associated with OA.73,74 In one study looking at dietary factors in OA, only vitamin K intake was shown to be inversely associated with the prevalence of radio- graphic knee OA.73 The presence of joint-space narrowing of the knee was also inversely associated with vitamin K intake. The prevalence of radiographic knee OA for each dietary vitamin K intake quartile decreased with the increased intake.73 Vitamin K may have a protective role against knee OA and might lead to a disease-modifying treatment. An ancillary study to a randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of phylloquinone supplementation (vitamin K arm) versus placebo on bone loss and vascular calcification among older adults regard- less of their vitamin K status. The parent study was a 3-year double- blind controlled trial. Participants were randomized and stratified by gender to either the treatment group (which received 500 mcg of phylloquinone as part of a single daily effervescent multivitamin for- mulation) or the comparator group (which received an identical mul- tivitamin formulation without phylloquinone) (Hermes Arzneimittel GMBH, Munich, Germany), hereafter referred to as the placebo group. All study participants also received elemental calcium (600 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day) as separate tablets.

insufficient vitamin K at baseline who attained sufficient concentra- tions at follow-up had 47% less joint-space narrowing.74 Foods rich in vitamin K include green tea, kale, turnip greens, spinach, and other green leafy vegetables.


Historically, many herbs have been used in the treatment of OA. When inflammation is present, those botanicals and nutritional factors pos- sessing anti-inflammatory activity can often be quite helpful. The research on curcumin, bromelain, and ginger is discussed in Chapters 73, 59, and 130, respectively, to avoid duplication. Curcumin appears particularly helpful.

## Boswellia Serrata

Boswellia serrata, a large branching tree native to India, yields an exudative gum resin known as salai guggul, which has been used for centuries, including use in arthritic conditions. Newer preparations concentrated for the active components (boswellic acids) are showing significant clinical results. Initially, boswellic acid extracts demon- strated antiarthritic effects in various animal models. Among several mechanisms of action are inhibition of inflammatory mediators, pre- vention of decreased GAG synthesis, and improved blood supply to joint tissues.75 Clinical studies using herbal formulas with Boswellia have yielded good results in OA of the knee, with patients experiencing decreased knee pain and swelling and increased knee flexion and walk- ing distance.76–79 Corroborating the improvements in pain scores and joint function with Boswellia were significant reductions in synovial fluid matrix metalloproteinase-3, indicating improved stability of the collagen matrix.77,78 The standard dosage for boswellic acids in arthri- tis is 400 mg three times daily. No side effects due to boswellic acids have been reported.

## Procyanidolic Oligomers

Two double-blind studies have been conducted with Pycnogenol in OA. In the first study, Pycnogenol (100 mg) or placebo was given daily for 3 months to 156 patients with OA.80 The global score on the WOMAC questionnaire for OA decreased by 56% in the treatment group versus 9.6% in the placebo group. Walking distance in the treadmill test was prolonged from 68 m at the start to 198 m in the Pycnogenol group compared with an increase from 65 to 88 m in the placebo group. The use of drugs decreased by 58% in the Pycnogenol group versus 1% under placebo. Foot edema decreased in 79% of Pycnogenol patients versus 1% in controls. Similar results were seen in a second study when Pycnogenol was given at a dose of 100 mg daily.81

## Limbrel (Flavocoxid)

Limbrel (Flavocoxid) is a proprietary mixture of the two flavonoid molecules baicalin and catechin. It is being promoted as possessing balanced inhibition of cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 and 5-lipoxygenase without the associated cardiovascular, renal, or gastrointestinal side effects of standard NSAIDs. Double-blind studies have shown results comparable with those with naproxen in relieving pain due to OA, with both medications being given at a dose of 500 mg twice daily.82–84 Flavocoxid does not increase bleeding time, inhibit platelet aggrega- tion, or inhibit or potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.85

## Harpagophytum Procumbens (Devil’s Claw)

Harpagophytum procumbens is a South African plant that grows in regions bordering the Kalahari. Secondary tuberous roots are used to prepare powders or extracts usually standardized for harpagoside, the principal active compound. A systematic review of the clinical efficacy of harpagophytum for OA concluded that products providing less than mg of harpagoside per day in the treatment of knee and hip OA were of little use, whereas dosages providing 60 mg of harpagoside daily showed moderate evidence of efficacy in the treatment of spine, hip, and knee OA.86 Some of the individual studies showed a significant benefit. For example, in a 2-month double-blind study on spine and knee OA, mg of powder three times a day was more efficient than placebo in reduc- ing pain scores.87 In a 4-month double-blind study on hip and knee OA, 2.6 g of powder/day was equal in efficacy to 200 mg of diacerein per day in improving pain scores, but it was better tolerated.88 In a review of clinical trials of devil’s claw extracts, adverse events occurred at a rate of about 3% and did not exceed the rate of those experienced with pla- cebo.89 Long-term use appears to be safe and without toxicity.

## Yucca

A double-blind clinical trial found that a saponin extract of yucca demonstrated a positive therapeutic effect.90 Results were of gradual onset, and no direct joint effects of the yucca saponin were noted. The researchers suggested that the clinical improvement was due to indirect effects on the gastrointestinal flora. This is an interesting suggestion because bacterial lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) have been shown to depress the biosynthesis of proteoglycans.91 It is entirely possible that yucca decreases the absorption of bacterial endotoxins and thus reduces this inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis. If this is the mecha- nism of action, then other saponin-containing herbs and other ways of reducing the endotoxin load may be useful.

## Additional Therapeutic Considerations

<!-- chunk -->

## Topical Analgesics

The mainstay of natural topical preparations for OA is those contain- ing either menthol-related compounds (e.g., one popular combination contains camphor 4%, menthol 10%, and methyl salicylate 30%) and/or capsaicin (typically creams containing 0.075%). These time-tested topical analgesics can often provide significant relief in OA, although each has compliance issues. Alternatives are products containing Celadrin—a mix- ture of cetylated fatty acids (Celadrin) with cetyl myristoleate, cetyl myri- state, cetyl palmitoleate, cetyl laureate, cetyl palmitate, and cetyl oleate. Celadrin has been shown to affect several key factors that contribute to inflammation. Its main action appears to be its ability to enhance the health and integrity of cell membranes. It therefore halts the production of inflammatory compounds known as prostaglandins. It also reduces the production of the negative immune factors like interleukin (IL)-6, which play a central role in inflammation. Studies have assessed both the oral and topical use of Celadrin. In a study with oral Celadrin, 64 patients with chronic OA of the knee were evaluated at baseline and at 30 and 68 days after consuming either placebo or Celadrin. Results indicated that com- pared with placebo, Celadrin improves knee range of motion (patients treated with Celadrin exhibited a significant 10.1-degree increase in knee flexion and overall joint function compared with patients given placebo).92 The effect of the Celadrin cream was studied in OA of the knees. Forty patients were randomly assigned to receive either the Celadrin cream or a placebo. Patients were tested on three occasions: (1) at baseline, (2) 30 minutes after initial treatment, and (3) after 30-day treatment of cream application twice a day. Assessments included knee ROM, timed “up-and-go” from a chair and stair climbing, and two other functional tests. For stair-climbing ability and the up-and-go test, significant decreases in time were observed 30 minutes after the first administration and after 1 month of use only in the Celadrin group. Likewise, the ROM of the knees increased with Celadrin both 30 minutes after the initial application and after 1 month’s use. In con- trast, no difference was observed in the placebo group. The other func- tional tests also clearly demonstrated improvements with Celadrin, whereas the placebo failed to produce results.93

## 1630SECTION 6 Diseases

In another study with topical Celadrin in patients with knee OA, patients were assessed by having them stand on a special platform for 20 and 40 seconds to measure static postural stability (the ability to stand comfortably in one place for a period of time). Again, only those subjects using the Celadrin cream demonstrated improvements.94 One of the key points regarding Celadrin is that unlike many other natural approaches, it produces almost immediate results.

## Proteolytic Enzymes

Preparations of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., pancreatic proteases chymo- trypsin and trypsin, bromelain, and fungal proteases) have been found useful in OA as well as a wide range of other inflammatory conditions (see Chapters 95 and 100 for more information). Several studies have used tablets containing a combination of bromelain 90 mg, trypsin 48 mg, and rutin 100 mg (Phlogenzym) at a dosage of 2 tablets three times daily or 3 tablets twice daily on an empty stomach. Two of these studies, both double-blinded, showed that this combination at the recommended dosage level produced clinical results in reducing pain scores due to OA on par with the drug diclofenac (100 mg daily).95,96 However, another double-blind study with bromelain alone (800 mg daily) produced no significant effects in OA.97


Traditional Chinese medicine typically views OA as a “bi” or pain syn- drome, with pathogenic etiologies stemming from coldness, damp- ness, heat, and wind. Each one of these types typically has a separate clinical picture and requires the use of specific acupuncture points. Standard Western medical systems have been slow to adopt acupunc- ture practice as standard adjunctive care despite mounting research evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of acupuncture in reducing pain from OA.98–100 For example, several studies have focused on knee OA. One obser- vational study of 563 patients (88% female) with chronic knee OA found that 75% of the participants achieved a reduction in pain of 45% or more with acupuncture.101 An open randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of acupuncture with and without adjunctive conventional medications.102 In this study, 30 patients with symptom- atic knee OA were randomized to one of three treatment groups. Those patients given acupuncture only or acupuncture combined with con- ventional medications achieved a highly significant improvement in pain. The acupuncture-free group experienced no change until after a course of acupuncture later in the study, when their improvement became significant. Similarly, significant positive changes were seen with pain and stiffness scores. These benefits were maintained during the month after the acupuncture course. Traditional Chinese medicine considers an etiology of pain as “stuck qi.” In this case, the addition of electrical energy to the area can reestablish qi flow, thus alleviating pain. One single-blinded, random- ized controlled study examined the effectiveness of electroacupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to alleviate OA-induced knee pain.103 In this research, 24 subjects (23 women and 1 man) with a mean age of 85 years were given electroacupuncture, TENS, or no treatment. Subjects in the electroacupuncture group received low-frequency (2-Hz) treatment at two local acupuncture points (ST-35, Dubi and Neixiyan) of the painful knee for 20 minutes. Subjects in the TENS group received low-frequency TENS treatment of 2 Hz and pulse width of 200 ms at the same acupuncture points for 20 minutes. In both treatment groups, electrical treatment was carried out for a total of eight sessions in 2 weeks. The other control subjects received OA knee care and education only. After eight sessions, there was a significant reduction of knee pain in both the electroacupunc- ture and TENS groups, with prolonged analgesic effect at a 2-week follow-up evaluation. Electroacupuncture also gained an advantage by lowering scores for the timed up-and-go test, which TENS did not achieve. Electroacupuncture has also been tested in a head-to-head 186-patient randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial against the NSAID diclofenac.104 For these knee patients, the improvement of OA symptoms in most outcome parameters was greatest in the elec- troacupuncture group. Unlike the diclofenac and placebo groups, most of the patients rated their results with electroacupuncture as “much better,” and substantially better pain management and functionality were obtained in the electroacupuncture group as well. In considering an acupuncture regimen, the researchers of one ran- domized controlled trial for patients with OA of the knee concluded that acupuncture is most effective when it is employed early in the treatment plan. Additionally, on the basis of patient evaluations, it seems that, to avoid a rebound effect, treatments should be adminis- tered with a tapering, methodical decrease in frequency once the acute treatment period is completed.105 Because it has been reported that the density of peripheral nerve endings in the skin or muscles is much greater in the acupuncture points compared with areas beyond these points, it is possible that an abrupt lack of stimulation in these areas may untowardly affect neurotransmitter release, thus contributing to a rebound effect.

## Magnetic Therapies

Magnetic therapy has been used in the treatment of a wide variety of chronic pain syndromes.106 Magnetic fields may have the ability to stimulate chondrocyte proliferation and increase the synthesis of proteoglycans. A number of studies clearly support magnetic therapy when used for knee OA.107,108 One is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 75 patients with OA of the knee who had previously been unable to obtain acceptable results using conventional treatments.107 Using low-frequency pulsed fields, improvements in the level of pain, functionality, and physician global evaluation of patients’ condition were notable. Mean morning stiffness also decreased by 20 minutes in the group using magnetic therapy while increasing by 2 minutes in the placebo group. A second placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical study of patients with osteoarthritic knees also showed significant results using low-amplitude and low-frequency fields.109 The reduction in pain after a treatment session was significantly greater in the magnet-on group (46%) compared with the magnet-off group (8%). A smaller, 29-subject study of knee OA used either high-strength magnetic or placebo knee-sleeve treatment for 4 hours in a monitored setting and self-treatment 6 hours daily for 6 weeks.108 This study demonstrated a significant decrease in pain scores in the active group and only a mini- mal improvement in the placebo group at 4 hours of treatment but no significant differences at 6 weeks. Magnetic therapies may be a useful treatment for OA.

## Relaxation Techniques

Relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and guided imagery have been used for many types of pain conditions. A study of 66 elderly people suffering from chronic OA pain eval- uated the effect of daily music listening on pain levels from OA.110 Differences in perceptions of pain were measured over 14 days in an experimental group that listened to Mozart selections for 20 minutes daily and a control group that sat quietly for 20 minutes daily. Those who listened to music had less pain compared with those who sat quietly and did not listen to music. The amount of pain perceived by the Mozart group also decreased incrementally over the 14-day study period.

## 1631CHAPTER 202 Osteoarthritis


Although there appear to be several worthwhile approaches used to control OA through natural therapies, a direct clinical study of a com- prehensive, integrated program has yet to be conducted. The therapeu- tic approach recommended here is based on reducing joint stress and trauma, promoting collagen repair mechanisms, and eliminating foods and other factors that may inhibit normal collagen repair (Fig. 202.3). All diseases or predisposing factors (see Table 202.1) should, of course, be controlled. NSAIDs such as aspirin should be avoided as much as possible. If NSAIDs must be used, deglycyrrhizinated G. glabra should be used to help protect the gastrointestinal tract from their damaging effects, and the use of NSAIDs should be discontinued as soon as pos- sible (see Chapter 85 for more information).


The achievement of ideal body weight is the primary dietary goal. All simple, processed, concentrated carbohydrates must be avoided; complex-carbohydrate, high-fiber foods should be emphasized; and fats should be kept to a minimum. Plants of the Solanaceae family should be eliminated (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers, and tobacco). Liberal consumption of flavonoid-rich berries or extracts is also important.


• Glucosamine sulfate: 1500 mg/day • Niacinamide: 500 mg six times/day (under strict supervision—liver enzymes must be regularly assayed) • Vitamin A: 5000 IU/day • Vitamin C: 1000 to 3000 mg/day • Vitamin B 6 : 50 mg/day • Vitamin K: 0.5 mg/day • Pantothenic acid: 12.5 mg/day • SAMe: 400 mg three times a day • Zinc: 45 mg/day • Copper: 1 mg/day • Boron: 6 mg/day


• Curcumin, see Chapter 73, Curcuma longa • Ginger, see Chapter 130, Zingiber officinale • Bromelain, see Chapter • Boswellia serrata: equivalent to 400 mg boswellic acids three times a day • Procyanidolic oligomers from either pine bark (Pycnogenol) or grape seed extract: 100 to 300 mg a day • Limbrel (Flavocoxid): 500 mg twice a day • H. procumbens: Dosage should provide a minimum of 60 mg harp- agoside a day. • Dried root powder (tablet or capsule): 2000 mg three times a day • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 mL three times a day • Dry powdered extract (standardized to contain 2.5% harpago- side): 750 to 1000 mg three times a day • Yucca leaves: 2 to 4 g three times a day

## Physical Therapy and Exercise

Physical activity that induces physiological or traumatic strain, such as occupational or recreational overuse of a joint, must be avoided. Normalization of posture and orthopedic correction of structural abnormalities should be used to limit joint strain.

Acupuncture can be administered two to four times weekly until acute symptoms resolve. Then the frequency of treatments should be gradually decreased. Maintenance treatments once every 2 weeks to once a month may help prevent recurrence.

## 1634SECTION 6 Diseases

healthy remodeling are called the basic multicellular unit (BMU). The average lifespan of a BMU osteoclast–osteoblast team is called the remodeling period. When all systems are functioning healthfully, a full cycle of both aspects of the remodeling process is completed in 3 to months.2 Unfortunately, many factors in the modern Western lifestyle can disrupt this healthy balance by increasing osteoclast activation and/or hampering osteoblasts’ ability to produce new bone. Because it takes far longer to build than to resorb bone, in either instance, bone removal outpaces rebuilding, leading to osteopenia and osteoporosis.

<!-- chunk -->

## Prevention and Reversal

The solution is neither to inhibit all osteoclast activity (as do the bis- phosphonates and denosumab) nor to artificially boost osteoblast activity (as do teriparatide and abaloparatide) but to restore balanced bone remodeling. This is done by (1) identifying, in each individual person, the specific factors promoting excessive osteoclast activation and eliminating or at least ameliorating them, and (2) ensuring the nutrient needs of the unique individual (not just those of the mythi- cal “average” person) are met so that osteoblasts are provided with an optimal supply of all the nutrients required to build new bone.


In both women and men, the importance of clinician assessment of risk cannot be overstated, in part because of the following two prob- lems with the standard criterion for the diagnosis of osteoporosis (i.e., a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] T-score of ≤ −2.5 at the lumbar spine, femur neck, or total hip): (1) most fractures in older adults occur in individuals who do not have osteoporosis by bone min- eral density (BMD) criteria, and (2) BMD norms have been calculated using data for young non-Hispanic white females, and race/ethnicity significantly affects the risk for osteoporosis.3,4 Recognizing that most fractures occur in individuals whose BMD indicates osteopenia, not osteoporosis, the most recent position state- ment from the National Bone Health Alliance Working Group has proposed that postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years or older should be diagnosed with osteoporosis if they have a “demon-

## strable elevated risk” for future fractures. Demonstrable elevated risk

includes a T-score of less than or equal to −2.5 at the spine or hip or: (1) having experienced a hip fracture with or without BMD testing; (2) having osteopenia by BMD testing and having sustained a vertebral, proximal humeral, pelvic, or, in some cases, distal forearm fracture; or (3) having elevated risk based on the WHO Fracture Risk Algorithm, FRAX (i.e., FRAX scores with ≥ 3% [hip] or 20% [major] 10-year frac- ture risk). According to the National Bone Health Alliance Working Group, prior low trauma fracture is suggestive of the highest risk for future fracture, and a low-trauma clinical vertebral fracture, proximal humerus fracture, or pelvic fracture is diagnostic of osteoporosis in a person with osteopenia. (4) The incidental finding of a vertebral frac- ture on a radiograph is also considered diagnostic of osteoporosis if the clinician has a reason to believe that it is likely to have been caused by reduced bone strength due to lower bone mass.

## Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry

In the United States, the standard criterion for the diagnosis of osteopo- rosis in postmenopausal women and older men is a bone mineral density test (DXA) T-score of ≤ −2.5 at the lumbar spine, femur neck, or total hip.3 Clinical practice guidelines universally recommend BMD screening (DXA) to identify osteoporosis, but not until women are 65 years and older and men are 70 years and older. Risk assessment is recommended to determine whether earlier DXA screening is warranted, and clearly, there are other ways to identify individuals at high fracture risk.

## Bindex

The tool most recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is Bindex, a point-of-care device that measures the cortical bone thickness of the tibia; calculates the Density Index, which estimates hip BMD as measured with DXA; and detects oste- oporosis with 90% sensitivity and specificity.5 A Category III Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code was issued for Bindex measure- ment in January 2018 that became effective July 1, 2018: 0508T—pulse- echo ultrasound bone density measurement resulting in indicator of axial bone mineral density, tibia6 In addition to DXA and Bindex, clinicians can diagnose osteo- porosis using the occurrence of low-trauma fractures, fracture risk algorithms (e.g., FRAX), biochemical markers of bone turnover, and clinician judgment of risk based on the presence of underlying causes of bone loss (discussed under “Therapeutic Considerations”).

## Fracture Risk Algorithms

<!-- chunk -->

## The fracture risk assessment tool may also be used to diagnose oste-

oporosis. FRAX is a WHO-sponsored, country-specific fracture risk assessment tool that combines BMD at the femoral neck (or total hip) with a group of well-validated and weighted clinical risk factors for fracture that are largely independent of BMD. Its use in the United States allows the assessment of fracture risk in both genders and four ethnic groups and is recommended primarily for individuals with a BMD finding of osteopenia. If the FRAX 10-year probability of hip fracture is ≥ 3% or the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic frac- ture is ≥ 20%, a diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made.3

## Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover

<!-- chunk -->

## Biochemical markers of bone turnover (BTMs) can be used to easily

and noninvasively assess skeletal turnover. BMD measurement does not assess all risk factors for fracture. Serum and urinary BTMs may: • Predict risk of fracture independently of bone density in patients • Predict rapidity of bone loss in patients • Predict extent of fracture risk reduction when repeated after 3 to months of treatment • Predict magnitude of BMD increases with treatment The most reliable markers of bone turnover are the serum rather than urinary forms of markers of bone formation and resorption. Serum bone formation markers include total osteocalcin (OC), a noncollagenous protein hormone produced by osteoblasts that binds calcium when activated by vitamin K 2 ; the bone isoenzyme of alka- line phosphatase (BAP), also produced by osteoblasts and involved in bone mineralization; and the N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP),which is cleaved from type I collagen during bone formation and released into the circulation, where its concentration is directly proportional to the amount of new collagen produced by osteoblasts.3 The most accurate and reliable bone resorption markers include serum C-terminal crosslinking telopeptides of type I collagen (sCTX), which are proteolytic fragments of bone collagen matrix, and the 5b isoen- zyme of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP-5B), an enzyme produced by osteoclasts. For postmenopausal women, negative and significant correlations are frequently reported between BTMs and lumbar BMD, especially for the bone formation markers, BAP and OC, and for the bone resorption marker sCTX. In premenopausal women, bone formation markers are rarely significantly correlated with BMD. Trends seem more marked with bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and sCTX, for which high levels indicate screening for osteoporosis, particularly when seen in conjunction with vertebral fracture or high bone remodeling diseases, such as hyperparathyroidism or endogenous hypercortisolism, or in anyone who has taken glucocorticoids for 3 months or longer.

## 1635CHAPTER 203 Osteoporosis

A high level of OC, bone ALP, or sCTX has been seen with prevalent vertebral fractures. Bone formation (ALP) and resorption (sCTX) lev- els have consistently been found to be higher in osteoporotic patients compared with controls. The most relevant BTM data reported in endocrine diseases associated with osteoporosis are high levels of bone ALP in primary hyperparathyroidism and low levels of OC in endoge- nous hypercortisolism. As noted, serum rather than urine testing is preferable. sCTX is an instructive example as it has several advantages over urinary markers of type I collagen degradation that also apply to other BTMs: sCTX does not require the measurement of urinary creati- nine, which is used to normalize varying urine excretion rates; it is widely available for any clinical laboratory; reference ranges estab- lished in large and well-documented populations of healthy pre- menopausal and postmenopausal women are available, although normal ranges in men are more limited; and sCTX has both a short-term and long-term within–subject variability that is approx- imately half that of urinary markers (around 10%–15% compared with around 20%–30%). However, this low within-subject vari- ability is only obtained when sCTX is measured in fasting subjects because food intake markedly decreases CTX levels and increases its variability.7–9 M81.0 is the billable/specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code that can be used to indicate a diagnosis of age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture for reimbursement purposes. The 2018 edition of the ICD-10-CM M81.0 became effective on October 1, 2017.10 M80* is the ICD-10-CM code for a pathological bone fracture due to the low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration characteristic of osteoporosis.11

# PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS

In women, the prevalence of osteoporosis at the femoral neck or lum- bar spine ranges from 6.8% in those aged 50 to 59 to 34.9% in those aged 80 and older. Among U.S. women aged 65 and older, approxi- mately 25.1% have osteoporosis (BMD T-score of ≤ −2.5), and 52.3% have low bone mass (BMD T-score between −1.0 and −2.5) calculated using BMD norms for young non-Hispanic white females, age-ad- justed to the 2010 Census Bureau estimates. A meta-analysis of data from 12 cohort studies including 29,082 women reported that at the age of 65 years, a woman’s risk ratio for hip fractures increased by 2.88 for each standard deviation (SD) decrease in BMD, and the risk of other osteoporotic fractures increased by 1.38 per SD decrease in BMD.10 Data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures and Women’s Health Initiative shows that postmenopausal women aged 50 and older with baseline T scores between −2.49 and −2.00 are likely to rapidly progress to osteoporosis, whereas postmenopausal women with base- line T scores of greater than −1.50 transition to osteoporosis much more slowly.10 In men, according to estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2008, the prev- alence of osteoporosis at the femoral neck or lumbar spine ranges from 3.4% in those aged 50 to 59 to 10.9% in men aged 80 and older. Among U.S. men aged 65 and older, approximately 5.7% have osteo- porosis, and 44.2 % have low bone mass.10 Despite lower overall frac- ture incidence, men have greater morbidity and mortality associated with hip fracture compared with women. Although the relationship between BMD and fracture risk is similar in both sexes, gender dif- ferences in bone size and geometry cause men’s bones to fracture at a higher mean BMD than women’s.4 Men are far more likely than women to die within 1 year after a hip fracture. The mortality rate in men within 1 year of hip fracture is 37.5%, which is 51% higher than in women.12 Almost one third of men with hip fractures who survive have subsequent osteoporotic fractures during their remain- ing lifetime. After a hip fracture, most new fractures occur in rela- tively younger men within 5 years, whereas most aged 75 and older die before experiencing a new fracture. No standard BMD screen- ing schedule exists for men, but because of these grim statistics, the American College of Physicians recommends that osteoporosis risk factors be evaluated in men aged 50 to 69 to determine whether DXA testing should be considered.3

## Regardless of Ethnicity, Risk for Osteoporosis Is High

Although African Americans are the ethnic group at the lowest risk, osteoporosis is projected to occur in 53% of African American women and 24% of African American men.13 Among Caucasians, the risk for low bone mass/osteoporosis is even higher; it is currently projected to develop in three out of four (77%) women and close to one of two (43%) men. Asian American women are at similar risk for osteopo- rosis as Caucasians. They share many of the risk factors that apply to Caucasian women, plus they tend to be slender and small-boned, and ∼ 90% are lactose intolerant and avoid dairy products. Currently, vertebral or spinal fracture occurrence is high among Asian American women, whereas hip fractures tend to be fewer due to differences in hip geometry and microstructural skeletal organization. However, Asians are not immune to hip fracture; the incidence of osteoporotic hip frac- tures increased by 300% in Hong Kong from the 1960s to 1990s, and more than 50% of all osteoporotic hip fractures are projected to occur in Asia by the year 2050.14-16 Mexican American women in the United States have an estimated prevalence of hip osteoporosis of 14%, com- pared with 17% of Caucasian and 6% of Black American women.17 However, from 2005 to 2025, a 175% increase in the incidence of osteoporotic fractures is projected to occur in Hispanic Americans, meaning that 86% of Hispanic American women and 53% of Hispanic American men will be at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures by 2025.13

## Risk Factors Indicating the Need for DXA Screening

All professional societies recommend DXA screening for women aged 65 years and older. For women younger than 65 years, risk factors sug- gestive of the need for DXA testing vary somewhat among authorities. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recom- mends that DXA testing be offered to all postmenopausal women between the age of 40 and 65 years with a history of fracture with- out major trauma, those with osteopenia identified radiographically, those starting or taking glucocorticoids for 3 months or longer, and perimenopausal women if they have low body weight (<127 pounds or bone mass index <20 kg/m2) along with a history of ever hav- ing received long-term glucocorticoid therapy, a family history of an osteoporotic fracture, early menopause, current smoking, or exces- sive consumption of alcohol. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recom- mends that women younger than 65 should receive DXA screening if they have a medical history of fragility fracture, a body weight of <127 lb, a medical cause of bone loss (medication or disease), are a current smoker, or have alcoholism or rheumatoid arthritis. The list of risk factors of the American College of Radiology (ACR) is perhaps the most extensive. The ACR recommends testing those younger than 65 years with risk factors, including estrogen deficiency; a history of maternal hip fracture over the age of 50 years; weight <127 lb; >1 year of amenorrhea before the age of 42 years; and women aged 50 years and older who experience a wrist, hip, spine, or proxi- mal humerus fracture with minimal or no trauma. Other risk factors

## 1636SECTION 6 Diseases

indicating the need for DXA include loss of height, thoracic kypho- sis, radiological evidence of low bone mass or compression fracture, and >3 months of glucocorticoid therapy or other medications asso- ciated with bone loss (aromatase inhibitors, chronic heparin, etc.). Metabolic or medical conditions that affect bone loss in the ACR’s list of risk factors include chronic renal failure; rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory arthritides; eating disorders, includ- ing anorexia nervosa and bulimia; organ transplantation; prolonged immobilization; and gastric bypass surgery. They also include endo- crine disorders that affect BMD (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, hyper- or hypothyroidism) and conditions associated with secondary osteopo- rosis, such as malabsorption, malnutrition, osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency, endometriosis, acromegaly, chronic alcoholism, cirrhosis, and multiple myeloma. The ACR’s list includes most of the previous factors and adds that women younger than 65 are at risk if they are postmenopausal women discontinuing estrogen replacement (hormone replacement therapy [HRT]). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry adds those women with a fragility history of hip fracture in a parent, current smokers, those with rheumatoid arthritis, and those with alcohol intake of more than 2 units per day (one unit is 12 oz of beer, 4 oz of wine, or 1 oz of liquor). The National Osteoporosis Foundation provides a list of risk factors in its most current (2014) Clinician’s Guide.8

Additional risk factors that should be considered but have not yet been included in any of the previously discussed lists appear in ital- ics in the following lists and have been added by this author. Many diseases have been shown to increase the risk of bone loss. A full dis- cussion is beyond the scope of this chapter. We only cover nonalco- holic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) here because its impact on bone is not commonly recognized and because it has become surprisingly prevalent.

## Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

NAFLD causes bone loss by disrupting the body’s ability to con- vert D3 into 25(OH)D. NAFLD is increasingly common; it’s now the most rapidly increasing and frequently seen chronic liver dis- ease, affecting about one out of three people in the Western world. Following menopause, the risk for NAFLD rises significantly; in more than half (55%) of women over age 60, liver function is compromised by NAFLD.18 Approximately 50% of patients with chronic liver disease have osteoporosis.19 The primary cause of NAFLD is insulin resistance, which itself is caused by diets rich in proinflammatory fats and/or refined carbohydrates (i.e., the stan- dard American diet).20

# CAUSES OF BONE LOSS

Anything that fuels chronic low-grade inflammation will trigger the cellular pathways that activate osteoclasts and/or hamper the ability of osteoblasts to produce new bone, promoting bone loss. Referred to as “secondary causes of osteoporosis” in the medical literature, inflam- mation dysfunction is an important underlying contributor to bone loss. Chronically upregulated inflammation combined with many other causes discussed in this section clearly explain the osteoporosis epidemic. Because treatment of the cause is foundational to naturo- pathic medicine, their control is critical for long-term successful care. What is surprising is the number and diversity of causes that must be considered.

<!-- chunk -->

## Standard American Diet

Heavily reliant upon highly processed foods and loaded with refined sugars and carbohydrates, sodium, proinflammatory fats (saturated fat, arachidonic acid, trans fats), excessive amounts of protein, and a mix of inflammation-provoking chemicals (e.g., phosphates and other food additives, pesticide residues), the standard American diet (SAD) is a recipe for bone loss.54

<!-- chunk -->

## Sodium

The SAD’s high sodium content causes calcium to be lost in the urine, which, in turn, stimulates bone resorption. Sodium and cal- cium compete for reabsorption in the kidneys. For every 100 mmol of sodium excreted in urine, 1 mmol of calcium is also lost. The recommended upper limit for sodium consumption for adults years and older in the United States is 100 mmol, which equals mg or 1 teaspoon of salt per day.55 The average daily sodium intake for Americans aged 2 years and older, derived primarily from pro- cessed and restaurant foods, is 3436 mg.56 Postmenopausal women lose more calcium relative to sodium than premenopausal women or men, and unlike either group, they are unable to compensate by absorbing additional calcium.57,58 The difference in the amount of calcium that will be lost in urine from a woman consuming mmol of sodium (50 mmol of sodium = 1150 mg sodium = ½ tea- spoon of salt) and one ingesting 150 mmol (150 mmol = 3450 mg sodium = ∼ 1.5 teaspoons of salt) amounts to 1 mmol (40.1 mg) more calcium lost per day. To put the harmful effects of this into “real-life” perspective: 1 mmol/d is the average negative calcium balance in the postmenopausal population (i.e., the amount of cal- cium the average postmenopausal woman loses daily from her total bone mass).57

<!-- chunk -->

## Excessive Protein

Calcium-balance studies have confirmed that calcium excretion in urine increases with high-protein diets: 0.25 mmol of calcium is lost for every 10 g of protein consumed. However, the increased incidence of fractures seen in subjects with high protein intake occurs mostly in individuals consuming nondairy animal protein. Why? Because the high concentration of calcium in dairy foods helps offset its protein-in- duced loss.54 Several studies have indicated that “protein and calcium act synergistically on bone—if both are present in adequate quantities

in the diet,” and that only when calcium intake is low does calcium loss caused by animal protein become a problem.59-64 When calcium intake is insufficient, high intake of animal protein can almost triple the risk for hip fracture. Data collected on 1752 men and 1972 women who participated in the Framingham offspring study showed those with cal- cium intakes of less than 800 mg/d, who were also consuming the most animal protein, had 2.8 times the risk of hip fracture compared with those consuming the least animal protein. In contrast, those consum- ing at least 800 mg/d of calcium, and also consuming the most animal

## protein, had an 85% reduced risk of hip fracture.65

<!-- chunk -->

## Refined Sugars and Carbohydrates

The average American consumes 125 g of sucrose (table sugar, pro- duced from sugar cane and sugar beets) and 50 g of high-fructose corn syrup daily. The SAD’s sugar-laden processed foods cause insulin secretion to spike with virtually every meal and snack, and hyperinsu- linemia promotes osteoporosis as well as metabolic syndrome, type diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. One of the ways in which chron- ically elevated insulin promotes bone loss is by inhibiting the kidney’s ability to reabsorb calcium, so more is lost in the urine.66 High- fructose corn syrup (which is composed of both fructose and glucose in approximately equal parts) is now the predominant sweetener used in processed foods and beverages. Thus increased consumption of these items results in increased consumption of glucose. In studies using human cells, high-dose glucose consumption has been shown to promote bone loss by inhibiting osteoblast proliferation. In human studies, providing male subjects 100 g of glucose increased the amount of calcium lost in their urine by ∼ 30% and increased the amount of magnesium lost by ∼ 40%; 100 g of glucose is present in a can of soda or a typical serving of fruit juice or in virtually any processed food made from refined flour, corn, or potatoes.67 Researchers looked at what happened to calcium excretion when they varied the amount of refined carbohydrate in an otherwise standardized diet in 18 normal subjects. The amount of calcium in the urine varies throughout the day, but increasing the refined carbohydrate content of the diet in this study caused a significant increase in the number of single urines with a calcium concentration above 9 mmol.68 To put this in perspective, the normal amount of calcium that should be found in an entire day’s (24-hour) urine collection is ∼ 15 mmol.69

## Metabolic Acidosis

Several components of the SAD (especially salt and sulfur-containing amino acids) cause chronic low-grade metabolic acidosis, which not only results in calcium being withdrawn from bone to restore a more alkaline state but also ramps up osteoclast activity.70

<!-- chunk -->

## Phosphate Additives

Increasing consumption of processed foods in the United States over the past decades has resulted in phosphorus consumption rising to a level that far exceeds the human requirement for this mineral and promotes bone loss.71 When the calcium-to-phosphorus dietary intake ratio is less than 1:1, secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is triggered. Chronic eleva- tion of either PTH or FGF-23 causes bone loss. A number of animal studies have shown that high dietary phosphorus relative to calcium induces secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone resorption, lower peak bone mass, and fragile bones in young as well as old animals. Several acute studies in healthy adult humans have shown that, even in healthy subjects, oral phosphate loading increases levels of markers of bone and cardiovascular disease. The PTH + FGF-23 combo, whose harm- ful effects were initially identified in patients with chronic kidney disease, is now known to cause bone loss and adverse cardiovascular effects, including arterial calcification, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy, in the general “healthy” population.72 Phosphorus is a processing aid with many different functions in pro- cessed foods. In any average person’s refrigerator or pantry, the major- ity of food products consumed for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks contain phosphorus in at least one, and often a number of, added ingredients. Although the amount of phosphorus in each item may be low, the total daily load of phosphorus adds up. Unlike phosphorus in whole foods, where it is bound to protein and other nutrients and thus is far more slowly and less efficiently absorbed, phosphorus in food additives is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. Colas are especially rich in phosphoric acid, a commonly used inorganic phos- phate additive in products ranging from all carbonated cola beverages to commercial salad dressings; phosphoric acid has an “absorption efficiency approaching 100%.”73,74

## Saturated Fats

Saturated fats in meat and dairy products from organically raised, pas- tured animals contain significant amounts of a bone-protective fatty acid, conjugated linolenic acid (CLA). Over the last 20 years, CLA has drawn significant attention for improving bone mass; reducing body fat, cardio- vascular diseases, and cancer; and beneficially modulating immune and inflammatory responses.75 In contrast, meat and dairy products derived from animals fed the animal version of the SAD (50% hay and silage and 50% grain) are high in proinflammatory omega-6 fats and low in CLA. Meat and dairy products from grass-fed animals contain 300% to 500% more CLA than products from cattle fed the conventional diet.76-78

<!-- chunk -->

## Polyunsaturated Fats

The SAD delivers high levels of omega-6s and very low amounts of omega-3s, typically a ratio of 20:1. This imbalance in essential fatty acids destroys bone through several inflammatory mechanisms, all of which combine to increase the production and activity of osteo- clasts and inhibit the production and activity of osteoblasts.79 The omega-3 fats are metabolized into anti-inflammatory prostaglan- dins (the PGE3 series) and are further converted into the resolvins and protections or specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), all of which decrease inflammation and the production and activity of osteoclasts.80,81 One of the most nefarious ways in which excessive consumption of omega-6s promotes bone loss is by causing mes- enchymal stem cells (MSCs) to develop into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts.82 Many studies have now shown that the anti-inflam- matory effects of the omega-3s lower osteoclast activity and reduce bone resorption. A reduction in the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 decreases the risk of not only osteoporosis but also obesity, cardio- vascular diseases, cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, and virtually every other disease affected by chronic inflammation. The omega-6s are not the enemy when in balance with the omega-3s. As demonstrated specifically in elders in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study, which evaluated 623 individuals whose average age was years, omega-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid [AA]) and omega-3s (DHA and EPA) protect hip bone health—if intake of omega-3s (EPA and DHA) is high enough to produce a ratio of no more than 4:1 omega-6:omega-3.81-85

## Trans Fats

Trans fats are hidden in many processed foods, including chips, cookies, cakes, pies, pastries, donuts, fried foods, artificial cream- ers and whipped cream, and French fries. Some frozen pizza brands contain up to 5 g of trans fats per serving; microwave popcorn con- tains up to 7 g per serving.86 They cause bone loss by upregulating inflammation.

## Monounsaturated Fats

As noted, the SAD is high in omega-6–rich vegetable oils and low in monounsaturated fats as well as omega-3s. Several studies have found positive associations between diets in which olive oil was the primary source of added fat and bone density, and other research showed that a higher ratio of monounsaturated fat in the diet was associated with a reduced risk of fracture in the elderly.87

## Gluten

In 460 BC, Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, stated, “All disease begins in the gut,” a foundational concept still taught in natu- ropathic medical schools. In 2010 AD, Dr. Alessio Fasano translated this medical insight into 21st-century idiom, saying: “The gut is not like Las Vegas. What happens in the gut does not stay in the gut.”88 Fasano was alluding to the fact that gluten, the major protein in wheat, disrupts gut function, not only in those with celiac disease but also in approximately 80% of humans, causing chronic inflammation that promotes numerous diseases, including osteoporosis. Fasano’s research team discovered that the tight junctions do not, as was con- sidered gospel until very recently, form an impenetrable, static barrier wall. Instead, these so-called “tight junctions” are actually doors that can be opened by zonulin, a protein that intestinal cells produce as a defensive mechanism. To date, only three agents have been found that trigger zonulin’s release: Vibrio cholerae (specifically, its toxin), patho- genic intestinal bacteria,89 and gluten—more accurately, a polypeptide in gluten called gliadin and more specifically, one of the indigestible peptide fractions within gliadin called α -gliadin. Exposure to α -gliadin increases risk of chronic inflammation in ∼ 80% of humans; only 80% because 20% do not produce zonulin. However, in addition to zonu- lin, gluten’s peptides contain at least 50 toxic sections (epitopes) that exert cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, and gut-permeating activities. Gluten causes a leaky gut, with widespread harmful ramifications for bone remodeling. When gluten is consumed at most every meal and snack day in and day out, as is the case in the SAD, intestinal permea- bility is constant. This allows undigested food components and inflam- matory microorganisms to gain access to the rest of the body. Why are we suddenly seeing a dramatic increase in gluten sensitivity? Because wheat has been significantly “hybridized” and “deamidated” over the last 50 years.90 Hybridization creates a new protein by combining dif- ferent strains of wheat, altering gluten’s protein sequence by as much as 5%. The result is a “new”—and to the food industry—“improved” wheat.91,92 Deamidation, used extensively in the processed food indus- try, uses acids or enzymes to render gluten, which is normally only soluble in alcohol, water soluble. This allows it to be more easily mixed with other food products but also has been shown to create substances that generate a severe immune response in humans.93-95 Any indi- vidual with osteopenia or osteoporosis should be evaluated for a glu- ten-related disorder as a contributing factor. Tests should be run for celiac disease and wheat allergy. If both are negative, a gluten-free diet trial should be run to evaluate for gluten sensitivity. If gluten sensitivity exists, beneficial responses will be seen within a matter of weeks, not months as is often the case for symptoms to lessen in someone with celiac disease. Symptoms suggestive of gluten-sensitivity include the following: • Osteopenia, osteoporosis • Dermatitis (eczema or skin rash) • Bone, joint or muscle pain (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) • Symptoms similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symp- toms (abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities—either diarrhea or constipation) • Weight loss • Leg or arm numbness • Muscle cramps • Anemia • “Foggy mind,” headache, fatigue • Depression96-100

Anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara) are nonsteroidal inhibitors that inhibit estrogen synthesis by outcompeting androgens to bind with aro- matase. Bone-destructive mechanism: Aromatase inhibitors thwart the activity of aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens. The loss of estrogen causes bone loss. Letrozole and anas- trozole increase bone turnover, decrease BMD, and increase the rel- ative risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures by 40%, compared with tamoxifen. Bone loss with increased risk of fragility fractures also occurs in women receiving exemestane. Only partial recovery of BMD occurs following withdrawal of aromatase inhibitors.101

## Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonists

Use: Management of endometriosis and breast cancer in premeno- pausal women; prostate cancer in men. Commonly prescribed examples: Leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard), buserelin (Suprefact, Suprecor), deslorelin (Suprelorin, Ovuplant). Bone-destruc- tive mechanisms: Suppress secretion of gonadotropin, which is required for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteiniz- ing hormone (LH) production, which is required for the ova- ries’ production of estrogen and progesterone in women and for the production of testosterone and its conversion into estrogen (estradiol) in men. Thus GnRH agonists suppress estrogen pro- duction, causing bone loss: in women, a decrease in BMD of about 6% per year. In men, GnRH agonists are often given along with aromatase inhibitors to maximize androgen deprivation. BMD at the hip, wrist, and lumbar spine decreases by 2% to 5% after 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy. The relative risk of vertebral and hip fractures increases by 40% to 50%. Men also experience a loss of lean body mass, an increase in fat mass, and impaired muscular strength, all of which contribute to increased risk of fractures.101,102

## Anticonvulsants

Use: To manage epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain. Com- monly prescribed examples: Dilantin, Luminal, Depacon. Bone-de- structive mechanisms: Interfere with vitamin D absorption and metabolism, cause vitamin D and calcium deficiency, may cause deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B 6 , also reduce blood levels of vitamin K.103

## Benzodiazepines

Use: To manage epilepsy, anxiety, insomnia, depression, schizophre- nia, restless leg syndrome. Commonly prescribed examples: Valium, Halcion, Xanax, Librium (far too many to list here). Bone-de- structive mechanism: Bind to dopamine receptors, causing chronic elevation of prolactin and suppressing the activity of the hypotha- lamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPA) axis. Because function of the HPA axis is required for the production of estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men, this disruption promotes bone loss.104-106

## Antidepressants

Use: Manage symptoms of depression, anxiety disorders, and some personality disorders (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, premature ejaculation). MAOIs are also used to man- age Parkinson’s disease. Atypical antipsychotics are used to manage schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. Commonly prescribed examples: SSRIs (e.g., Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil), MAOIs (e.g., sele- giline [Emsam, Deprenyl]), atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzap- ine [Zyprexa], risperidone [Risperdal], blonanserin [Lonasen]). Bone-destructive mechanism: Inhibit dopamine production and neurotransmission, causing chronic elevation of prolactin, which disrupts the activity of the HPA axis and the production of sex hor- mones.107-109

<!-- chunk -->

## Insulin-Sensitizing Medications

Use: Manage type 2 diabetes Commonly prescribed examples: Thiazo- lidinediones (a.k.a. glitazones, e.g., Avandia, Actos).Bone-destruc- tive mechanisms: Trigger MSCs to develop into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts, chondrocytes, or myocytes, thus decreasing bone formation and increasing the formation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT; belly fat). Excess VAT is linked to abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other inflammatory diseases.110 The glitazones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are selective agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR- γ ), whose activation of in mesenchymal cells leads to increased adipocyte differentiation and decreased osteoblast differentiation. The thi- azolidinediones also decrease the expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1), a growth factor that promotes bone formation. Plus, thiazolidinediones promote osteoclast development and bone resorption. Long-term treatment with thiazolidinediones increases the risk of fractures by up to fourfold in postmenopausal women and in men. Risk correlates with the duration of treatment and is significant within 12 to 18 months.101

## Opioid Pain Medications

Use: Manage chronic pain. Commonly prescribed examples: morphine (sold under more than 100 trade names), codeine (sold under dozens of trade names, often combined with aspirin, acetamin- ophen, or ibuprofen), hydrocodone (Lortab, Norco, Vicodin), oxycodone, methadone, tramadol. Bone-destructive mechanisms: Disrupt normal HPA regulation of hormone production. Increase the production of prolactin. Inhibit the production of estrogen and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Increase production of thy- roid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which directly suppresses bone remodeling. Lower testosterone production in men.111 The use of opioids as a long-term treatment for chronic pain has increased so dramatically that opioid-induced deficiency of androgens (DHEA and testosterone) has been given its own acronym in the medical literature: OPIAD.112

<!-- chunk -->

## Glucocorticoid Medications

Use: Manage allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases. Commonly pre- scribed examples: Prednisone, Prednisolone, Kenalog, Dexameth- asone. Bone-destructive mechanisms: Glucocorticoids suppress osteoblast activity and hence bone formation while, at the same time, osteoclast numbers are either unchanged or slightly increased. Glucocorticoids induce production of caspase 3 and other proteins central to cellular apoptosis, causing apoptosis in both osteoblasts and osteocytes. Because osteocytes play a central role in skeletal sensing of the need for bone repair and in bone repair, this results in weakening of bone (within 6 months) even when glucocorti- coids are used at very low doses. Glucocorticoids change the bal- ance between receptor activator for NF- κ B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). RANKL, which is generated by osteoblasts and osteocytes, is a key regulator of osteoclast recruitment, activa- tion, and survival. Osteoblasts and osteocytes also produce OPG, a decoy receptor for RANKL that inhibits its actions on osteoclasts. The balance between RANKL and OPG is a central determinant of more (RANKL) or less (OPG) bone resorption; glucocorticoids tip this balance in favor of RANKL. Glucocorticoids also cause an increase in the production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a proinflammatory cytokine that triggers the production of more proinflammatory cytokines, promoting the generation of osteoclasts. Glucocorticoids also directly prolong the life span of mature osteoclasts. Glucocorticoids inhibit Wnt protein expression in mature osteoblasts, which results in MSCs becoming adipocytes instead of osteoblasts. Glucocorticoids deplete vitamin D 3 . BMD drops 6% to 12% within the first year of glucocorticoid use, and approximately 3% per year afterward. Fracture risk escalates up to 75% within the first 3 months (Fig. 203.1).113,114

## Calcineurin Inhibitors

Use: As immune system suppressants given in combination with glu- cocorticoids in patients undergoing organ transplantation to help prevent organ rejection. Commonly used examples: Cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Bone-destructive mechanisms: Disrupt vitamin D metabolism and calcium absorption and cause secondary hyper- parathyroidism.101

<!-- chunk -->

## Antacids, H2 Blockers, Proton Pump Inhibitors

Use: Manage symptoms of indigestion, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Commonly prescribed examples: Antacids include Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, Tums, Alka Seltzer, and Milk of Magnesia. H2 blockers include Tagamet, Zantac, Pepcid, and Axid. Proton pump inhibitors include Prilosec, Prevacid, and Nex- ium. Bone-destructive mechanisms: Stomach acid is required for the digestion of food. Many vitamins (particularly B 12 , whose absorp- tion requires both HCl and intrinsic factor) and minerals required for healthy bones, including calcium, are not solubilized without stomach acid. Antacids neutralize stomach acid after its secretion. H2 blockers block the activity of histamine-producing cells in the stomach lining, whose release of histamine signals parietal cells to secrete HCl, thus preventing HCl production. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) block the proton pump inside parietal cells in the stomach lining, which produce and secrete HCl and intrinsic fac- tor. PPIs are the most potent of the acid-blockers; just one pill can reduce stomach acid secretion by 90% to 95% for 24 hours. PPIs are strongly associated with significantly increased fracture risk.115-119

<!-- chunk -->

## Loop Diuretics

Use: Manage high blood pressure, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and certain kidney diseases. Commonly prescribed example: Furosemide (Lasix). Bone-destructive mechanisms: Directly increase the kidney’s elimination of calcium, reducing its blood levels, triggering PTH secretion and the withdrawal of calcium from bone. Loop diuretics also increase sodium loss, sometimes to the point of causing hypo- natremia. Approximately one third of total body sodium resides in the bone, with 40% of bone sodium content being exchangeable with sodium in the bloodstream. A moderate but persistent loss of both bone sodium and calcium either indirectly, via an increased renal excretion caused by loop diuretics, or directly, by hypona- tremia-induced bone resorption, negatively affects bone strength and fracture risk. Hyponatremia also increases bone resorption by

## 1642SECTION 6 Diseases

increasing both osteoclast formation and activity. Add to this the depletion in blood volume caused by all forms of diuretics, which increases the likelihood of postural hypotension (dizziness when sitting up or rising into standing position), and you have a perfect setup for a fracture-causing fall. Loop diuretics may also deplete magnesium.114,120-122

## Anticoagulants (Coumarins, Heparin)

Use: Coumarins prevent excessive blood clot formation; heparin pre- vents deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and is the most frequently used anticoagulant in hemodialysis for patients with chronic kidney disease. Commonly prescribed examples: War- farin (Coumadin), heparin, unfractionated heparin, low-mo- lecular-weight heparins. Bone-destructive mechanisms: Warfarin prevents vitamin K recycling and therefore the activation of osteo- calcin, a vitamin K–dependent protein (VKDP) that ushers calcium into bone, and the activation of matrix Gla protein, a VKDP that inhibits calcium deposition in soft tissues (e.g., blood vessels, heart, kidneys, breast, brain). Heparin does not affect cortical bone but rapidly decreases trabecular bone volume by disrupting vitamin D metabolism and inducing secondary hyperparathyroidism. The result is a significant drop in osteoblasts’ production and activity and in osteoid surface in the bone, accompanied by a large increase in osteoclasts and bone resorption.114,123 Low-molecular-weight heparin may be less destructive to bone than other forms of hep- arin, but not enough clinical trials have been run to determine whether this is the case.124

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid Hormone Replacement Medications

Use: Manage hypothyroidism. Commonly prescribed examples: Armour thyroid, levothyroxine, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Unithroid. Bone-destruc- tive mechanism: In 25% of patients, doses of thyroxine prescribed are slightly higher than needed or become so over time.101 A dose of thyroxine (LT4) even slightly in excess of need causes suppres- sion of TSH. TSH directly protects bone by inhibiting the production of osteoclasts.125 In addition, low TSH may indicate hyperthyroid- ism, which significantly increases bone turnover and reduces BMD. Although bone formation and bone resorption both increase, bone resorption outpaces bone formation, resulting in bone loss. TSH should be monitored regularly, and the LT4 dosage adjusted accord- ing to results, in anyone on long-term LT4 replacement therapy.114,126

## Hormonal Contraceptives: Birth Control Pills, Intrauterine

<!-- chunk -->

## Devices, Injectable Depo-Provera

Use: Prevent pregnancy. Commonly prescribed examples: Oral con- traceptives contain either a combination of patented versions of “estrogen” and progesterone (a “progestin”) or a progestin only. Commonly prescribed combination “estrogen” and progestin pills include Apri, Yaz, Yasmin, Ortho-Novum, Ogestrel. Commonly prescribed progestin-only pills include Camila, Errin, Heather, Jolivette, Nora-BE.56 Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone) is a long-acting progestin-only contraceptive provided via injection every 3 months. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) that dispense the pro- gestin levonorgestrel (e.g., Mirena) are another often-prescribed option. Mirena remains effective (and is left in place) for 5 years. Bone-destructive mechanisms: Oral contraceptives lower blood lev- els of vitamin B 6 and vitamin B 12 , causing levels of homocysteine to rise. High levels of homocysteine are associated with both car- diovascular disease and osteoporosis, in particular, hip fracture. Homocysteine inhibits lysyl-oxidase, which plays an important role in collagen crosslink formation, so inhibition results in the production of a weakened bone matrix. Homocysteine causes the balance between RANKL and OPG to shift in favor of RANKL, promoting osteoclast generation and activity. Elevated levels of homocysteine also increase oxidative stress, another key insti- gator of osteoclast production and activity.127,128 Birth con-

## 1643CHAPTER 203 Osteoporosis

trol pills, whether they contain only “estrogen” or combine the “estrogen” with a progestin, work by inhibiting follicular devel- opment and preventing ovulation. Thus both types of birth con- trol pills prevent ovulation and, therefore, the formation of the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone, which is required for the development of osteoblasts.129-136 In the Canadian Mul- ticentre Osteoporosis Study, oral contraceptive users had BMD scores 2.3% to 3.7% lower than those of women who had never used oral contraceptives.137 The progestin-only contraceptive Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone) is the most widely used contraceptive worldwide. Because of its common use in younger women and documentation that its administration may be asso- ciated with loss of BMD, the FDA has attached a black box warn- ing to its label.138 The progestin-only contraceptive Mirena, now being used in women as young as 14 years of age, is an IUD that dispenses levonorgestrel and not only prevents ovulation but also typically causes amenorrhea. A recent meta-analysis estimated a BMD increase of 0.5% per year in women with normal ovulation but a decrease in BMD of 0.7% per year in young women with ovulatory disturbances (anovulation or short luteal phase).139

## Lead

Since January 1, 1996, when the U.S. Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles, lead levels have dropped signifi- cantly in the population. However, virtually everyone older than 50 was exposed to leaded gasoline during their childhood and teenage years when growing bones were most vulnerable. Now, as these individuals enter menopause or andropause, and their rate of bone loss increases, the lead that was safely sequestered is being released—and greatly contributing to postmenopausal and andropausal bone loss.140-142 Furthermore, although public health measures removed lead from gasoline (except aviation fuel), lead continues to contaminate many U.S. homes. In 2006 an estimated 22% of U.S. homes—23.2 million of them—still contained lead-based paint. Paint deteriorates, flakes, and becomes lead-laden dust in the air and on the floors, carpets, and so forth in our homes. Data from the 2007–2010 NHANES revealed that 535,000 young children could have unsafe blood lead levels (at or above μ g/dL).143 A recent analysis indicated that the United States loses $50.9 billion in economic activity each year because of IQ points lost to lead exposure.144 More than 90% of the lead is sequestered in bones. But bone is constantly being remodeled, and in the process of bone resorption, calcium is not the only mineral released into the bloodstream. The lead that was quarantined in bones is released into the bloodstream along with calcium. Clear associations have now been found between increased bone levels of lead and osteoporosis,145 kid- ney disease, cataracts, and high blood pressure. Current research has led to strong recommendations to further lower the presently allowed blood lead level to minimize chronic cumulative lead toxicity.140,142 Lead decreases osteoblast formation while not affecting osteoclast production and activity, and it also damages the kidneys, impairing their ability to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25-D.140-142 Lead blocks the production of transcription factor-2 (Cbfa-1/Runx-2), a transcrip- tion factor involved in MSCs’ maturation into osteoblasts rather than adipocytes. Lead increases the production of sclerostin, a bone morphogenetic protein agonist produced by osteocytes, and peroxi- some proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR- γ ), whose activation in MSCs causes their differentiation into adipocytes. The combination of these factors—Cbfa-1/Runx-2, sclerostin, and PPAR γ —is called the Wnt/ β -catenin pathway (see Fig. 203.1) When Cbfa-1/Runx-2 is not inhibited, and sclerostin and PPAR- γ are, this pathway builds bone. Lead distorts the healthful balance among the bone-remodeling actions of the Wnt/ β -catenin pathway. Lead also interferes with heme synthesis, calcium-dependent enzyme systems, and hormone metabolism (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, growth hormone—all of which affect bone) and causes nerve degeneration, impairing muscle contractions that trigger bone formation. In pre- menopausal women, elevated levels of uric acid, one of lead’s adverse effects on the kidneys, correlate with lack of ovulation and therefore inhibition of progesterone production. Lack of progesterone inhibits osteoblast production. Lack of ovulation results in infertility.146 Bone lead levels can be evaluated by means of K-x-ray fluorescence, a tech- nique developed in the last 20 years that measures the lead content in the cortex of the tibia and the patella. One caveat: K-x-ray fluores- cence testing may overestimate lead levels in individuals having low bone density and underestimate lead levels in individuals with higher bone density. It is therefore important to ensure the radiologist inter- preting your patient’s films is aware of these issues and knows how to accommodate for them.147,148

## Cadmium

Cadmium accumulates in kidneys and bone and has a biological half- life of 10 to 30 years.149,150 The urinary cadmium level considered “safe” by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is 3 mcg/g creatinine.151 However, according to the latest research, a “safe” level of urinary cadmium appears to be no more than 0.05 mcg/g creatinine, preferably less. A urine cadmium level of even 0.5 mcg/g creatinine may still have adverse effects on bone; in the studies, the level of urinary cadmium shown to cause bone loss has continued to be lower. In 1999 a study in Belgium of pop- ulations living in the vicinity of zinc smelters found that urinary cadmium excretion of just 1 mcg/g creatinine was associated with a 73% increased risk of bone fractures in women and a 60% increased risk of height loss in men. This amount—1 mcg/g creatinine—is one third the U.S. OSHA “safe” level. Other studies conducted on popu- lations in cadmium-contaminated areas in China and Sweden have produced similar findings. In China, the osteoporosis prevalence in women aged 50 or older who lived near a smelter increased from 34% in the control group to 51.9% in heavily polluted areas. Early kidney damage, osteoporosis and a threefold increased risk of fractures were also found in a study of more than 1000 people living in the vicin- ity of a nickel cadmium battery plant in southern Sweden. In these studies, urinary cadmium levels of 3 nmol/mmol creatinine (equiv- alent to 2.98 mcg/g creatinine, i.e., the U.S. OSHA supposedly “safe” level) caused osteoporosis. In another a population-based study of 2688 women in Sweden, in comparison with women whose urinary cadmium level was less than 0.50 mcg/g creatinine, those with uri- nary cadmium levels of 0.75 or greater mcg/g creatinine had a 245% increased likelihood of osteoporosis at the femoral neck and a 197% increased likelihood of osteoporosis of the lumbar spine. Among women who had higher urine levels of cadmium, despite the fact that they had never smoked, the situation was surprisingly worse. The likelihood of osteoporosis among never-smokers who, none- theless, had high urinary levels of cadmium was increased by 347% for osteoporosis at the femoral neck and by 326% for osteoporosis at the lumbar spine. The authors of this paper concluded that even among women who have never smoked, possible cadmium toxicity is of much greater concern than has been previously thought. And these never-smokers developed osteoporosis with urinary cadmium levels of just 0.75 mcg/g, far less than the U.S. OSHA “safe” level of 3 mcg/g creatinine. Data from a number of recent studies now indicate that urinary excretion of cadmium greater than 0.05 mcg/g creatinine damages the kidneys and promotes bone loss, fragility, and fractures.152 When researchers drew data from two NHANES studies

## 1644SECTION 6 Diseases

(1988–1994 and 1999–2004) involving 4258 women aged 50 or older, women with urinary cadmium levels between 0.50 and 1.00 mcg/g creatinine had a 43% greater risk for hip-BMD–defined osteoporo- sis compared with those with urinary cadmium levels lower than or equal to 0.50 mcg/g. Once again, smokers did not show a statisti- cally increased risk. This is not to say that smokers’ bones are not at increased risk of cadmium-caused osteoporosis. Cigarette smoke delivers cadmium, which is well absorbed from the soil by tobacco plants, to the lungs, where it is much better absorbed than the cad- mium ingested in food. Unfortunately, the high-phosphate fertil- izers used in conventional agriculture deposit significant amounts of cadmium in the soil, with the amount depending on where the phosphates were mined. The phosphate fertilizers used on conven- tionally grown crops can contain cadmium in amounts up to mg/kg.153 The U.S. FDA’s Total Diet Study update (2007) reported a 26% increase in dietary cadmium exposure from 1990 through 2003. Cadmium intake, which occurs primarily from consumption of phosphate-fertilized food, rose from 8.81 to 11.06 mcg per per- son per day. This translates to 21% of the supposedly “safe” tolera- ble intake of cadmium for a week.154According to NHANES III data covering the years from 1988 to 2004, 73% of U.S. women 50 years of age or older are estimated to have cadmium body burdens greater than 0.50 mcg/g creatinine, a level that has repeatedly been found to significantly increase risk for osteoporosis. These data and the results of the most recent studies suggest that 21% of osteoporosis preva- lence among women aged 50 years or older may be attributable to cadmium.154 What these studies tell us is that (1) U.S. women are at increased risk for osteoporosis at urinary cadmium levels way below OSHA’s “safety” standard of 3 mcg/g creatinine151,154 and (2) dietary cadmium in con- ventionally grown foods, rather than tobacco, is the primary source of cadmium-related osteoporosis risk in the U.S. female population aged 50 years or older. Comparable research has not yet been done on men, but this author predicts it will reveal that dietary cadmium is a signif- icant risk factor for osteoporosis in aging men as well.155 Cadmium disrupts parathyroid hormone’s signaling to kidney cells to activate vitamin D, inhibits the enzymes in the kidney that convert 25(OH) D to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3, and damages the renal tubules, causing hyper- calciuria. Cadmium also inhibits the activity of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, diminishes osteoblasts’ ability to mineralize bone and produce collagen, further diminishes bone’s collagen content by stim- ulating osteoclast formation and activity, and activates gene expression of “toxic response” pathways in bone cells, further stimulating osteo- clastic bone resorption.

## Mercury

Mercury is ubiquitous in the environment, but the most common sources of exposure are dental amalgam fillings and fish, with lesser amounts coming from air, water, vaccinations, and cosmet- ics. Mercury compounds, such as those found in fish, vaccinations, and cosmetics, are water soluble, with a bioavailability of 7% to 15% after ingestion. Upon entering the body, mercury compounds accumulate mainly in the kidneys, causing damage and disrupting, among other essential kidney functions, the activation of vitamin D. Possibly by preventing the formation of 1,25-D, mercury causes hypocalcemia and calcium’s withdrawal from bone.156 Human exposure to elemental mercury, from dental amalgams (so-called “silver” fillings, which are typically 55% mercury), for example, is mainly by inhalation, which is followed by rapid absorption and distribution to all major organs. The primary target organs of ele- mental mercury are the brain and the kidneys. Elemental mercury is lipid (fat) soluble and can cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas inorganic mercury compounds are not lipid soluble, which is why inorganic mercury preferentially accumulates in the kidneys.156 Elemental mercury also enters the brain from the nasal cavity through the olfactory pathway; for this reason, it is essential that the removal of dental amalgams be done by an ecologically trained dentist who knows how to minimize the release of mercury during extraction.157,158 Emerging research is showing that mercury poi- soning plays a significant role in high blood pressure, cardiovas- cular disease, stroke, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.159 All of these conditions promote chronic inflammation, which promotes excessive activation of osteoclasts, excessive bone loss, and osteoporosis.

## Fluoride

The primary sources of exposure to fluoride are diet (food and water) and fluoride-containing dental products (e.g., toothpaste). Fluoride is found in higher concentrations in soft, alkaline, and calcium-deficient waters, and because the fluoride compounds that occur naturally in drinking water are almost totally bioavail- able (90%), they are virtually all absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.160,161 Along with fluoridation of community drinking water to prevent dental caries has come an increase in dental fluorosis. In its mild forms, fluorosis appears as tiny white streaks or specks in the tooth enamel. In its severe form, pitting and brown discolorations, which are permanent and can darken over time, disfigure the teeth. As of 2005, 23% of persons in the United States aged 6 to 39 years had mild or more severe dental fluorosis.161 Fluoride activates both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Although fluoride may increase bone mass, the newly formed bone lacks normal structure and strength. Under a microscope, the “crystallization pattern” of bone from flu- oride-treated animals and humans reveals itself to be abnormal. In trabecular bone, fluoride increases bone volume and thickness but does not increase bone structure, reducing bone quality despite the increase in mass. After ingestion, fluorine goes first to the liver, but it is such a powerful oxidizer—the strongest oxidizer currently known—that it impairs the liver’s attempts to prepare it for excre- tion and passes into the bloodstream, from which it is rapidly dis- tributed to all tissues, including bones.162 Once inside bone, fluorine overwhelms bone cells’ ability to produce glutathione, and when defenses have been eliminated, it destroys osteoblasts and causes inflammation, triggering increased osteoclast production and activ- ity.163,164 Fluorine accumulates in bone, binding to and blocking the activity of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme involved in the production of osteoblasts. Fluorine also reduces levels of cop- per, zinc, manganese, and other trace minerals required by other enzymes involved in osteoblast activity.165 Bones are largely com- posed of calcium compounds, up to 50% of which is hydroxyapa- tite. Fluorine converts hydroxyapatite to fluorapatite. This changes bones’ crystalline structure, delays further mineralization with cal- cium, and causes a reduction in bones’ mechanical strength proper- ties.161 Hydrogen fluoride reacts with calcium to form an insoluble salt, CaF 2 . This salt must be eliminated by the kidneys, and as it goes, it carries out some calcium from the bone matrix.166 Increased fluoride intake has been repeatedly shown to increase blood levels of parathyroid hormone and to cause hyperparathyroidism and increased bone resorption.

## Pesticides

Dietary exposure to pesticide residues, even to very low doses of pes- ticide mixtures, is now recognized to be damaging to human health. Several animal studies, using models that duplicate human dietary exposure, have recently looked at the effects of pesticides both singly

## 1645CHAPTER 203 Osteoporosis

and when combined (as they are in real life) in doses correspond- ing to what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says are “Acceptable Daily Intakes” (ADIs). (ADIs are also referred to as NOAELs, the acronym for “no observed adverse effect levels.”) When pesticides were approved for use on food crops, they were evaluated singly. We now know that when combined, their toxic effects are synergistic. A study in which female mice were exposed to pesticides while pregnant and while breastfeeding their young found that cell signaling was disrupted in offspring bone marrow cells, adversely affecting lymphocyte and red blood cell production. Hypoxia causes inflammation. Lymphocytes eliminate pathogens, toxins, and cellu- lar debris, all of which cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation triggers excessive activation of osteoclasts and bone loss. Endosulfan, a widely used pesticide evaluated in this study, is a well-known pro-oxidant that activates NF- κ B and JNK, which trigger the pro- duction of other proinflammatory mediators (i.e., TNF- α , IL-6), which then restimulate the original compounds (JNK and NF- κ B) that initiate inflammation. The end result is a vicious feed-forward cycle of chronic inflammation. Subclinical chronic inflammation has been recognized as a driving factor in metabolic syndrome, which is a driving factor in type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis.167 Exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds is strongly associated with an increased incidence of kidney disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, all conditions in which low-grade, chronic inflammation plays a prominent role, and each of which is strongly associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis.168-176

## Excessive Alcohol Consumption

More than one drink (1 ounce of ethanol) per day for women or two drinks per day for men will decrease bone formation via a number of mechanisms. Excessive alcohol intake decreases the secretion of leptin, which has recently been found drive MSC differentiation into osteo- blasts; suppresses the activity of IGF-1, an agent of growth hormone, which is an important regulator of bone growth and remodeling; dam- ages the liver, thus impeding the conversion of D3 to 25(OH)D; lowers blood levels of estradiol; causes osteocytes to commit apoptosis; sup- presses the bone-building Wnt pathway and increases the activity of its antagonist, DKK1; and lastly, high levels of acetaldehyde, the main metabolite of ethanol, directly inhibit osteoblast proliferation and activity. A small amount of alcohol, however, regardless of the type consumed, has beneficial effects on bone, causing blood levels of sev- eral markers of bone resorption (osteocalcin, CTx, and NTx) to drop. Plus, an increase in estrogen level has been observed in women drink- ing small amounts (no more than 10 g/d) of alcohol and in men with light alcohol consumption.177

## Nutrient Insufficiencies

The SAD is also sorely lacking in the foods (e.g., leafy greens and other vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds) rich in the vita- mins and minerals that bones must have to rebuild. Americans’ intake falls short for every one of the key bone-building nutrients (Table 203.1) The role of deficiencies of each nutrient is discussed fully under “Therapeutic Considerations.”

## Term Solution

An inadequate supply of the nutrients essential for healthy bones and an overabundance of harmful factors that mitigate against healthy bone remodeling are the real causes of the osteoporosis epidemic. The drugs currently available to treat osteoporosis, none of which remedies its true causes, offer, at best, only short-term postponement of excessive bone loss and, at worst, cause serious adverse effects, including the fractures they are prescribed to pre- vent (Table 203.2).

## Pharmacological Therapy Adverse Effects

The two most common significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by the antiresorptives are atypical femur fractures and osteo- necrosis of the jaw.178 Epidemiological studies have found that women taking alendro- nate over extended periods are 12.5 times more likely to suffer a femur fracture than women not taking the bisphosphonate: “Current epi- demiologic evidence suggests that long-term bisphosphonate use (>5 years) may be an important risk factor for atypical fractures.”179,180 Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ; also now referred to in the medi- cal literature as bisphosphonate-related ONJ [BRONJ]. antiresorptive

agent-induced ONJ [ARONJ], or the all-inclusive term drug-induced ONJ [DRONJ]). Preventing osteoclasts from playing their required roles in normal bone remodeling, which is what the bisphosphonates and denosumab do, results in the accumulation of dying bone in the jaw and its eventual exposure to the inside of the mouth, along with greatly increased risk of oral infection—precisely what is seen in indi- viduals taking bisphosphonates or denosumab who develop ONJ.181 Since 2001, thousands of case reports have been published of patients who developed ONJ after taking a bisphosphonate (often alendro- nate BECAUSE it is the most commonly prescribed but also quite frequently zoledronic acid) to prevent or treat bone loss. Just one of the papers reporting bisphosphonate-induced ONJ, published in 2010, was entitled “Bisphosphonate-Induced Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: A Review of 2400 Patient Cases.”182 The route of administration (oral or IV) of a bisphosphonate and the duration of treatment affects the pro- jected time to onset of ONJ. The average time to ONJ onset is 3 years for intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates and 5 years for oral bisphospho- nates.2 However, the risk for ONJ has been found to increase fourfold after 2 years with both IV and oral bisphosphonates. A study published in 2012 in the Journal of Evidence-Based Dental Practice involved patients (>40 years of age) with ONJ drawn from dental practices in three practice-based research networks. The risk of ONJ was greater with IV bisphosphonates, for which the odds ratio was 299.5, than oral bisphosphonates, for which the odds ratio of 9.8 was still quite high.183 Denosumab is not less likely to cause ONJ. When denosumab was compared head to head with the IV bisphosphonate zoledronic acid, in a large group of patients, ONJ occurred in more patients treated with denosumab (20, or 2%, of 1026) than those treated with zoledronic acid (14, or 1.4%, of 1020 patients).184 Other potential adverse effects of the bisphosphonates and denos- umab include the following: • Atrial fibrillation185-189 • Erosions and ulcerations of the esophagus (throat) and severe dam- age to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract190 • Esophageal cancer191 • Influenza-like illness192-194 • Myalgia195 • Deterioration of kidney function and kidney failure196,197 • Symptomatic hypocalcemia198-200 • Conjunctivitis, uveitis, and scleritis201-203 • Inflammatory jaw diseases in addition to ONJ, including osteomy- elitis, osteitis, periostitis, and sequestrum204 Denosumab causes all the adverse effects seen with the bisphos- phonates, plus infections requiring hospitalization, including eczema, cellulitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, divertic- ulitis, appendicitis, and sepsis.205-208 The antiresorptives’ lack of efficacy is demonstrated by the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one fracture. Table 203.3 provides data collected by Curtis et al. (2008) on the vertebral and hip frac- ture efficacy of the oral bisphosphonates, specifically on the number of women who must adhere to treatment for 1 year to prevent one frac- ture of the type specified.209 The NNT data are unimpressive, and when the incidence of ADRs is considered, these drugs appear useful only for very limited indications, as described in the following discussion. All patients = osteopenic + osteoporotic. (The majority of osteopo- rotic fractures happen in individuals with BMD T-scores in the osteo- penic range (−2.5< T-score <−1).210 A review published in the journal Drugs in 2011 included an eval- uation of the NNTs for denosumab. The researchers reviewed pla- cebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, pivotal Phase III trials employed as part of the regulatory process in order to calculate NNTs for denosumab for 3 years to prevent one hip fracture. After 3 years, postmenopausal osteoporotic women receiving denosumab had “a slightly reduced risk of hip fracture with a cumulative incidence of 0.7% in the denosumab group versus 1% in the placebo group” (i.e., out of 1000 women benefitted), giving an NNT of 334 (i.e., 334 women had to adhere to treatment with denosumab for 3 years to prevent one hip fracture).211 Not surprisingly, given their numerous adverse effects, long-term adherence to the oral bisphosphonates is quite poor. Even in persons with full-blown osteoporosis who have already suffered an osteopo- rotic fracture, more than half of such patients prescribed these drugs discontinue bisphosphonate therapy within 1 year. In their study, tracking 101,038 new bisphosphonate users for 3 years, Curtis et al. found that the proportion of persons with high adherence at 1, 2, and 3 years was 44%, 39%, and 35%, respectively.209 The anabolic drug approved for the management of osteoporosis is teriparatide, a fragment of human PTH including the amino acid sequence 1-34. If the amount of PTH secreted is chronically elevated, hyperparathyroidism results, causing bone loss. If PTH is elevated intermittently, the effect of once-daily injections of teriparatide, more osteoblast than osteoclast stimulation occurs, producing a net effect of increased BMD. Unfortunately, even chronic intermittent elevation of PTH by the standard dose of teriparatide (20 mcg/d) has been found to cause a number of undesirable side effects, including not only nau- sea, leg cramps, and dizziness but also hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperuricemia, hypomagnesia, and myopathy.213-216 Of more concern are the chronically elevated cortisol levels seen and the potential for long-term increased risk of osteosarcoma. Chronic elevation in cor- tisol levels is not a surprising outcome because teriparatide causes a spike in PTH levels, and PTH increases the adrenal glands’ secretion

of cortisol. The issue specific to bone is that cortisol, when continu- ously elevated, kills osteocytes.217,218 Osteosarcoma occurred in 45% of the animals in the studies conducted to test the teriparatide’s safety and efficacy and resulted in its carrying an FDA black box warning of this potential outcome.219,220 Although teriparatide advocates claim human development of osteosarcoma is “unlikely,” physicians and researchers have voiced concerns about the long-term consequences of teriparatide’s use, even when restricted to short-term use in younger patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.221 Teriparatide may also increase the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. In a 10-year longitudinal prospective study, 514 individuals, ranging in age from 75 to 85 years, were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) at base- line and at intervals of 1, 5, and 10 years. Elevated PTH indicated a 220% increased risk of an at least 4-point decrease in MMSE and a 300% risk of an increase in CDR class within the first year of follow-up. The risk remained significantly elevated even after controlling for age, gender, baseline cognition, serum Ca2+, creatinine, and APOE4.222 The connection is that sustained elevated levels of PTH in the brain increase the risk of calcium overloading, which leads to impaired blood flow in the brain and brain degeneration.223-225 Interestingly, when PTH activity is excessive, the human body tries to inhibit PTH produc- tion in two ways: by increasing blood levels of calcium and decreasing blood levels of magnesium. As noted previously, both hypercalcemia and hypomagnesia are seen in response to teriparatide. After 3 to 5 years maximum, a “drug holiday” is recommended from treatment with the antiresorptives. The use of teriparatide is cur- rently approved for no more than 24 months; studies indicate that the drug’s ability to stimulate bone formation begins to wane after 6 to months, and as soon as it is discontinued, significant bone loss ensues almost immediately.226,227 Because the bones continue to remodel throughout a person’s life, any effective bone-building regimen must be one that can be followed long term, and the only protocol that meets these requirements is to identify and avoid as many of the numerous factors present in our modern lifestyle that cause excessive osteoclast activation as possible while providing an adequate supply of all the nutrients bones require to rebuild via diet and supplements, along with weight-bearing exercise.

## Calcium

The average dietary intake of calcium in the United States today is 600 to 700 mg, far short of the 1200 to 1500 mg/d intake recom- mended.228-230,646Our ability to absorb calcium decreases with age. By age 65, in both men and women, calcium absorption is only 50% of adolescent absorption levels.231-233 Effective absorption and healthful use of calcium require both vitamin D 3 and vitamin K 2 . Without ade- quate vitamin D, only 10% to 15% of dietary calcium is absorbed.234 Vitamin D, although essential for active absorption of calcium, does nothing to regulate what happens to that calcium once inside the body. This is the job of vitamin K–dependent proteins (VKDPs) acti- vated by vitamin K 2 : osteocalcin, which is responsible for delivering calcium to bones, and matrix Gla protein, which is responsible for preventing calcium deposition in soft tissues, such as arteries and kidneys.235-244 Calcium supplements to consider include calcium car- bonate, calcium citrate, and algae-derived calcium (AlgaeCal Plus). Supplements providing calcium alone or calcium plus vitamin D help slow the rate at which bone is lost, but that’s all.230,245 Almost all calcium supplements that have been shown effective in clinical studies include multiple supportive nutrients, not just calcium. For example, AlgaeCal, as can be seen in Figs. 203.2, 203.3, and 203.4, has been shown effective in several clinical studies, likely because it naturally contains not just calcium but also ∼ 70 trace minerals (which are lacking in the modern food supply and are essential for bone health) along with vitamin D 3 , K 2 (as MK-7), vitamin C, and additional magnesium and boron.246-250 Calcium bioavailability does not differ significantly among cal- cium supplements when taken with food, except in those who have had gastric bypass surgery or are taking acid-blocking medications. These individuals should use calcium citrate.251-253 Hydroxyapatite is an expensive form of calcium marketed as ready-made to be utilized in bone; however, the science is not supportive of this claim. When calcium is consumed, before absorption, it will be disassociated during digestion from any compound to which it has been bound. Calcium will be released from the phosphorus in hydroxyapatite, as it will from the citrate in calcium citrate or carbonate in calcium carbonate. In comparison studies, hydroxyapatite has not been shown to produce better results than calcium carbonate or citrate.254 Furthermore, add- ing to the load of phosphorus from phosphate additives (discussed previously) is not recommended.255 Calcium absorption is optimized with sufficient vitamin D 3 to maintain a 25(OH)D level of 50 to 80 ng/ mL—consuming foods containing 500 to 700 mg of calcium, along with supplemental calcium taken in a dose of ∼ 350 mg twice daily. When more than 500 mg of calcium is consumed at one time, the addi- tional calcium will be excreted, serving a useful function to avoid short- term overload but not furthering bone formation.252,256-259 Calcium supplementation does not increase the risk of heart attack or kidney stones when calcium intake is balanced with adequate supplies of K 2 as well as D 3 .260,261 Supplemental calcium may cause constipation when supplies of magnesium are insufficient. Supplemental magnesium will be best absorbed taken with pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P), the activated form of vitamin B 6 . Dairy products do not increase fracture risk, with one possible exception: lactose-containing cow’s milk due to the proinflammatory galactose derived from lactose during digestion. The consumption of lactose-free cow’s milk avoids this issue.262 The Upper Limit (UL) recommended for calcium is 2500 mg/d for men and women aged 19 to 51 and 2000 mg/d for men and women age and older.


Of the magnesium in the human body, 60% is found in bone. Magnesium is a key constituent of the bone matrix and is required for osteoblast production, development, and activity. PTH signaling, which increases the kidneys’ resorption of calcium and the produc- tion of 1,25-D, also cannot occur without magnesium.263,264 Just sup- plementing postmenopausal women with low PTH with magnesium (thus restoring calcium absorption) has been shown to improve BMD and reverse osteoporosis.265,266 Magnesium insufficiency results in increased production of peroxynitrite, superoxide, the PGE2 series (proinflammatory) prostaglandins, substance P, C-reactive protein, TNF- α , and RANKL, all of which promote osteoclast differentiation and activity.267-270 Americans of all ages consume less magnesium than their respective Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), which is the amount thought to be “adequate,” not optimal, for 50% of the population; 55% of women and 58% of men aged 51 to 70 years, and 70% of women and 80% of men over age 70 are not meeting the EAR. Stress and a number of commonly prescribed drugs (oral contracep- tives, gentamycin, amphotericin, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, and proton pump inhibitors) increase the risk of magnesium defi- ciency.271-278 The recommended balance between calcium and mag- nesium is 2:1; thus, a daily intake of 1200 mg of calcium requires mg of magnesium.279,280 Magnesium oxide, which is 60% elemental magnesium compared with magnesium citrate, which is only 11% elemental magnesium, is preferable and should be consumed with

food to ensure stomach acid availability.281-285 Magnesium is best absorbed and utilized when taken in divided doses over the course of the day along with P5P.286-289

## Boron

Boron improves calcium retention290 and boosts osteoblast produc- tion and activity,291-293 largely by increasing the production of the key proteins involved in the bone mineralization process, including col- lagen type I (COL I), osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin (OCN),293 bone morphogenetic protein,294-296 and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Boron supplementation also maximizes estrogen’s effect of increasing calcium and magnesium absorption into bone, optimizing the benefit to be derived from wan- ing estrogen during and after the postmenopausal transition.290,297 Boron may be especially helpful as men age because it increases the amount of free testosterone in circulation.298-302 In addition, boron increases the amount of time vitamin D [25(OH)D] remains in circulation.303-306 Boron improves magnesium absorption and lowers CRP307 and TNF- α .298,308,309 Governmental health authorities have not provided us with an EAR, Recommended Daily Intake (RDI), or Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for boron, but we do have a recommendation for boron’s Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). For adults 18 years or older, the UL is 20 mg per day.310 This is reassuring because the research indicates that 3 to 6 mg/d will meet our needs; however, a supplement is typically required. In boron-rich areas of the world, such as Turkey, daily boron intake averages 12.6 mg with no adverse effects, a good indication of boron’s safety.311 In the United States, however, soils are not boron-rich, and the diet provides far less than 3 mg/d. In boron researchers Rainey et al. estimated that the average daily intake of boron in the United States was 1.17 mg a day for men and 0.96 mg per day for women. And people were eating more fruits and vegetables then.312 Food Processor data from 1996 that has been widely quoted reporting the boron-content of foods were found to have greatly over- estimated the actual amounts of boron present. Unless your patients are consuming 6 oz of raisins, 6 avocados, or 18 oz of peanut butter daily, a supplement is needed to provide at least 3 mg/d.313


Zinc plays a critical role in collagen formation, promotes osteoblast proliferation, and is required for their production of the bone matrix and its calcification. Zinc’s role in bone is both structural, because bone mineral is composed of hydroxyapatite crystals, which contain zinc, and formative, because zinc is required for osteoblasts’ activity; plus, zinc promotes bone mineralization through its role as a cofac- tor for the bone-building enzyme bone alkaline phosphatase. Zinc also inhibits osteoclasts’ bone-resorbing activity, lessens inflammation by acting as an antioxidant, prevents age-associated hyperparathyroid- ism, is required for the production of 1,25-D, and protects against the absorption of toxic heavy metals.314-323 The RDI for zinc is 11 mg/d for LunarCDCIHTI p<0.0001 p<0.0001 p<0.0001 3.0% 2.0% 1.0% 0.0% 80 + 757065605550454035302520 –2.0% –1.0% –3.0%

men and 8 mg/d for women (if pregnant, 11 mg/d; if breastfeeding, mg/d). The current research shows that 15 mg is required to increase bone density. Because zinc’s UL is 40 mg per day, 15 to 20 mg/d should be safe. NHANES III reported that >6% to 7% of Americans were at risk of zinc deficiency. Among women aged 50 or older and men aged 60 or older—those with the greatest age-related risk of osteoporo- sis—almost none consumed the RDI for zinc.314,324,325 Long-term con- sumption of zinc in amounts greater than 40 mg/d can cause a copper deficiency. Intake of zinc:copper should be 15:1.326,327

<!-- chunk -->

## Copper

Copper is a cofactor required by a wide array of enzymes, including two powerful antioxidants, ceruloplasmin and superoxide dismutase, plus enzymes involved in the formation of collagen and connective tis- sue and tooth and bone mineralization. In humans, copper deficiency is known to promote poor bone quality, periodontal disease, and oste- oporosis.328 The main adverse effect attributed to copper deficiency is that lysyl oxidase, an enzyme whose activity is essential for crosslinking between collagen and elastin that requires copper as its cofactor, stops working. This quickly results in greatly reduced strength in the bone matrix. Copper also directly inhibits osteoclasts’ bone-resorbing activ- ities.315,322According to national surveys, the average dietary intake of copper in the United States is 1.0 to 1.1 mg per day for adult women and 1.2 to 1.6 mg per day for adult men. Intake of copper should be balanced with zinc intake and not exceed 4 mg/d. Consumed in excess or out of balance with zinc, copper can increase the production of free radicals, causing oxidative stress, damage to lipids, and bone loss.315,327

## Manganese

Manganese is critical for bone because it’s required for the production of chondroitin sulfate, which plays a key role in the first steps in bone formation, and also because it is the cofactor for mitochondrial super- oxide dismutase (MnSOD), which is so essential for life that animals genetically modified to lack MnSOD die almost immediately.329-331 In humans, manganese insufficiency promotes low bone mineral density and osteoporosis, and low MnSOD activity increases the risk for osteo- porosis—and cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Osteoblasts build bone using enzymes that require manganese. Manganese is also required for the production of cholesterol, the pre- cursor of all our hormones, for thyroid hormone production. Low manganese levels are frequently found in patients with hypothyroid- ism, and hypothyroidism promotes bone loss.315,332-336 Human studies have found that dietary intake of 3 mg/d was not enough to maintain positive balance (i.e., prevent a decline in the body’s manganese lev- els); in one study, slightly more than 5 mg per day was needed. The research indicates that manganese intake of 3 to 5 mg per day should be recommended. The UL has been set at more than twice that—11 mg per day, and no ADRs (adverse effects) have been reported below this level of intake.337

## Silicon

Silicon increases the synthesis of type I collagen, the production of osteoblasts, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and the extracellular matrix, and it improves calcium’s incorporation into bone.338 Not surprisingly, in vitro and in vivo (animal and human) studies of silicon-containing implants and ceramics show that these implants bond far more effectively to bone than their non–silicon-con- taining counterparts.339 In animal models of menopause, silicon has improved calcium–magnesium imbalances. What typically happens with menopause is that blood levels of calcium increase, a sign that calcium is being withdrawn from bone, whereas those of magnesium decrease, increasing the risk of high blood pressure. Bioavailable silicon lowers blood levels of calcium and increases those of magne- sium.340 In two large epidemiological studies conducted in the United States, the original Framingham Study and the Framingham Offspring study, consumption of at least 40 mg/d of silicon was associated with greater BMD: a difference of as much as 10% more BMD was seen between those individuals with the highest (>40 mg/d) and lowest (<14 mg/d) intakes of silicon. In these studies, men’s silicon intake was significantly greater than women’s, averaging 30 mg/d in the original Framingham Study and 33 mg/d in the Framingham Offspring study, whereas women averaged 24 mg/d in the original Framingham study and 25 mg/d in the Framingham Offspring study. Men’s greater sili- con intake was explained by their proclivity for beer.338,339,341 A study that focused specifically on whether supplementing with silicon could increase BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis found that it did—and it significantly outperformed a bisphosphonate.342 Another study of silicon supplementation in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis evaluated silicon’s effect on trabecular bone. Study participants were divided into three groups: a control group, a group given an injection containing 16.5 mg/wk for 4 months, and a third group receiving an oral silicon supplement providing 27.5 mg/wk for 3 months. The women consumed their normal diets, and no supple- mental calcium or vitamin D was given. Both groups receiving sup- plemental silicon had significant increases in trabecular bone volume compared with the control group.343,344 Silicon’s effects have also been studied in osteopenic women who were given either 3, 6, or 12 mg/d and compared with controls who did not receive a silicon supplement. All four groups received calcium and vitamin D supplementation, but no other forms of treatment. After 1 year, the control group showed a decrease in femoral bone density, whereas the groups given silicon maintained but did not further improve bone density.345 However, because consumption of at least 40 mg per day is the amount that was found to improve BMD in the Framingham studies, the doses of silicon provided in this research were far too low, even for the group receiv- ing the highest dose, which was just 12 mg/d. Other research suggests that estrogen boosts silicon’s utilization. In the Framingham studies noted previously, higher silicon intake correlated with increased BMD for men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women on HRT, but not those not on HRT. A later study conducted in Aberdeen, Scotland, found that higher silicon intake had a highly beneficial effect on femoral BMD but only in women who were “estrogen-replete,” that is, were premenopausal or, if postmenopausal, on HRT. Among these women, femoral BMD was an average of 2% higher in those consum- ing the most silicon (an average of 31.5 mg/d) compared with those consuming the least (an average of 16.5 mg/d).346 Several factors lessen the ability to absorb silicon, including a vegetarian or vegan diet high in phytates, the age-associated decrease in stomach acid production, and hypothyroidism, which decreases our ability to metabolize silica and absorb silicon.339 Mineral water and beer are, by far, the richest dietary sources of bioavailable silicon. Following these, the silicon in whole grains and grain products (breakfast cereals, breads, rice, and pasta) is moderately well absorbed, whereas even less is absorbed from green beans and fruits. Bananas, despite their relatively high silicon content, provide virtually no usable silicon because the highly polymerized form found in bananas—and in colloidal silica supplements—is not soluble.347,348 Silicon is primarily found in nature as silica (silicon diox- ide, SiO 2 ), an inorganic compound that is insoluble in water and that the human body is unable to convert to a soluble, bioavailable form. Certain marine algae, such as algas calcareus, from which AlgaeCal is produced, dissolve inorganic silica and convert it to orthosilicic acid, silicon’s water-soluble, bioavailable form. Independent laboratory analysis of AlgaeCal powder indicates that the daily 4-capsule serv- ing of AlgaeCal Plus provides 24.5 mg of orthosilicic acid (OSA). The

next best supplemental option is BioSil, which is OSA concentrated from liquids and then stabilized by being combined with choline. One capsule of BioSil provides 5 mg of OSA and 100 mg of choline. The recommended dose is 2 capsules per day.349 Silicon is present in some antacids, for example, magnesium trisilicate. Unfortunately, the silicon in antacids is silicate, a highly polymerized form that is very poorly absorbed.350 Water-soluble forms of silicon are absorbed in the intes- tinal tract, with excess amounts eliminated by the kidneys within 4 to 8 hours, so it is highly unlikely that silicon might accumulate to exces- sive levels in healthy individuals. Individuals with chronic kidney dis- ease who are on dialysis might accumulate silicon because renal failure impairs its excretion. However, even though blood levels of silicon up to 10 times normal have been reported in patients with renal failure, no adverse effects have been seen, even at these levels.339

Several large human studies have confirmed that an insufficient supply of selenium adversely changes bone metabolism, promot- ing bone loss.351,352 Blood levels of selenium are inversely related to the rate of bone turnover in both men and women: low selenium results in increased bone resorption and loss of BMD, whereas ade- quate selenium correlates with lessened bone resorption and increased BMD.353,354 Selenium is essential for bone health for two reasons: (1) As the required cofactor for the selenoenzymes, selenium plays a key role in an array of antioxidant defenses that both lessen the production and activation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and increase the prolif- eration and activity of bone-building osteoblasts.28,354-356 (2) Healthy thyroid hormone function is dependent on selenium because this trace mineral is a required cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes, which acti- vate and deactivate the thyroid hormones, according to need. Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism cause bone loss.353,357-359 Ensuring optimal amounts of selenium are present to promote selenoenzyme activity is especially important for individuals whose genetic inheritance includes an SNP that results in the production of a slow version of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1). Carriers of this SNP have increased levels of bone turnover markers and are at increased risk of low BMD. SNPs that result in the production of slow versions of other selenoenzymes are also associated with increased inflammatory signaling and increased risk of osteoarthritis.28 Selenium’s importance for bone health is viv- idly illustrated by a recent case-control study that investigated the link between antioxidant intake and the risk of osteoporotic hip fracture and whether this link was modified by cigarette smoking, which is well known to greatly increase the risk for hip fracture. Ever-smokers were divided into five quintiles according to their selenium intake. Those in the highest quintile had a 73% lower risk of hip fracture compared with those in the lowest quintile.354 The RDI for selenium is 55 mcg/d. The UL is 400 mcg/d. The NOAEL is 800 mcg/d. The dosage used in clinical trials, provided by most supplements containing selenium and recommended here for optimal health, is 200 mcg/d.360 The most accu- rate way to determine whether supplemental selenium should be con- sidered is a laboratory test to check glutathione peroxidase activity. A number of labs now offer this test, including Genova Diagnostics (see https://www.gdx.net/product/oxidative-stress-analysis-2-test-blood) and the Mayo Clinic Laboratories (see http://www.mayomedicalla boratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/9765). Selenium is a “Goldilocks” nutrient: either too little or too much is harmful. Insufficient selenium promotes free-radical damage, chronic inflam- mation, increased osteoclast production and activity, decreased osteo- blast production and activity, and impaired thyroid function—all of which cause bone loss. Epidemiological studies have suggested that low selenium status increases the risk of colorectal, prostate, lung, bladder, skin, esophageal, and gastric cancers and male infertility. However, if regularly consumed in amounts greater than the NOAEL (800 mcg/d), selenium can be toxic.361 Early indicators of toxicity are a garlic odor on the breath and a metallic taste in the mouth. The most common clinical signs of chronic excessive selenium intake are hair loss, white spots on the nails, nail brittleness, and nail loss. Excessive consumption of selenium during pregnancy may cause birth defects. Choose a sele- nium supplement that contains selenomethionine and/or selenocyste- ine, the organic forms of selenium, and delivers no more than 200 mcg of selenium per daily dose. On days when selenium-rich foods are con- sumed, particularly Brazil nuts (so rich in selenium that no more than 2 Brazil nuts/d should be eaten),362 supplemental selenium should not be taken.

## Iodine

Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones and is therefore an essential element for bone mineralization. Depending on iodine’s availability, the thyroid gland can enhance or limit its use for thyroid hormone production. When compensation fails, as in severely iodine-deficient populations, hypothyroidism and developmental brain damage are the dominating disorders. In less severe iodine defi- ciency, the normal thyroid gland can adapt to keep thyroid hormone production within the normal range. Prolonged thyroid hyperactivity leads to thyroid growth along with increased risk during follicular cell proliferation of mutations producing multifocal autonomous growth and function. In populations with mild to moderate iodine deficiency, such multifocal autonomous thyroid activity is a common cause of hyperthyroidism in elders, and the prevalence of thyroid enlargement and nodularity is high. The average serum TSH tends to decrease with age in such populations as a result of the high frequency of autono- mous thyroid hormone production. On the other hand, hypothyroid- ism is more prevalent in populations with a high iodine intake. Many thyroid processes are inhibited when iodine intake becomes high, and the frequency of apoptosis of follicular cells increases. Abnormal inhibition of thyroid function by high levels of iodine is especially common in people affected by thyroid autoimmunity (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). In populations with high iodine intake, the average serum TSH tends to increase with age. This phenomenon is especially pro- nounced in Caucasian populations, in which a genetically determined high tendency to thyroid autoimmunity is surprisingly common. A small tendency to higher serum TSH may be observed when iodine intake is brought from mildly deficient to adequate, but at present, no evidence suggests that slightly elevated serum TSH in elderly people leads to an increase in morbidity and mortality.363 In fact, in older peo- ple, higher TSH and lower free T4 (FT4) concentrations within the euthyroid range (see following discussion) have been recently shown to be associated with a lower risk of multiple adverse events, including mortality.364 In relation to bone, specifically, a cross-sectional study of healthy Korean women aged 65 and older with normal thyroid function found that low-normal serum TSH levels were associ- ated with more than double the risk for osteoporosis of the lumbar spine.365 Other research comparing the body level of iodine in postmenopausal women, 34 of whom were healthy and served as controls, 38 with osteopenia, and 60 with osteoporosis, found uri- nary iodine levels of 216.1 ± 125.2 in the control group, 154.6 ± 76.6 in the osteopenic group, and 137.5 ± 64.9 in the osteoporosis group, differences that were maintained after adjustment for body mass index. The urinary iodine level accurately correlated with the T-score for the lumbar spine and was significantly associated with total T-score.366 The conclusions drawn by these researchers: the level of serum TSH has a direct association with osteoporosis, and hypothyroidism may lead to postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Hyperthyroidism also leads to a loss of BMD because it results in accelerated remodeling and a decrease in the volume of trabecu- lar bone. Subclinical hyperthyroidism in postmenopausal women adversely affects bone mineralization and has been shown to result in significantly lower BMD in the femur, neck, and radius. When women with subclinical hyperthyroidism were compared with a control group, the decline in BMD inversely correlated with FT4 levels.367-369 The right amount of iodine is extremely important for bone health; the question is: How much is the right amount for the individual patient? The iodine RDI for adults of 150 mcg/d (220 mcg/d for preg- nant women), although sufficient to prevent goiter, may be inadequate for the promotion of optimal bone health in older adults. Despite the widely held assumption that Americans are iodine sufficient due to the availability of iodized salt, the U.S. population is at substantial risk for iodine insufficiency. Iodine intake has been decreasing since the early 1970s as a result of changes in Americans’ food and dietary habits. The addition of salt to home-cooked meals is now discouraged; iodized salt is rarely used in restaurant and processed foods; and the iodized salt sold for home use has been found to provide far less iodine than the amount listed on the label. Iodine is no longer used in the dairy indus- try or in the production of bread, and in addition, the widespread dis- persal of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate (competitive inhibitors of iodide uptake) in the environment blocks absorption of the iodine Americans consume.370 Given these considerations, intake of 200 mcg to as much as 1 mg/d, an amount less than the UL of 1.1 mg/d and far less than the 3 to 6 mg/d commonly consumed in Japan, occurs without increased incidence of autoimmune thyroiditis or hypothy- roidism. Larger amounts than currently officially recommended may be necessary to support not only thyroid hormone production but also iodine’s important antioxidant functions in the breast and other tis- sues in which this trace mineral is concentrated.370 Nonetheless, the consensus among recently published epidemiological studies is that the optimal level of iodine intake to prevent disease is within a rela- tively narrow range around the RDI. Population iodine intake below 150 mcg/d is clearly associated with a high incidence and prevalence of goiter and hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid autonomy, and occur- rence increases with age. Population iodine intake above 150 mcg/d is associated with a higher level of serum TSH and increased incidence of hypothyroidism in the population, particularly in individuals with some degree of thyroid autoimmunity, which is reflected in the pres- ence of antithyroid antibodies (i.e., antithyroid peroxidase antibodies [anti-TPO antibodies]) and leads to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.363 Those with a Caucasian genetic background have a high tendency to such thyroid autoimmunity, which is now thought to affect as many as half of elderly women.371 The reference intervals for thyroid hormones are as follows: TSH 0.5 to 4.4 mIU/L; FT4 10 to 20 pmol/L; and free T3 (FT3) 1.1 to 2.4 nmol/L.372 In sum, regular monitoring and adjusting of each patient’s iodine intake to support levels of thyroid hormones within these reference ranges is essential. Lastly, proper functioning of the thyroid gland also requires sufficiency of a number of other minerals in addition to iodine (i.e., selenium, iron, zinc, copper, and calcium).371,373

## Strontium Citrate

Of the total amount of strontium in the body, 99% is localized in bone, a trait it shares with calcium. Strontium both lowers the rate of bone resorption and promotes the rate at which new bone is built.374,375,647 Natural stable strontium salts (e.g., strontium citrate) are safe (at the dosages noted herein and when twice as much calcium is consumed as strontium) and highly beneficial. In more than 100 years of research and data collection on strontium, strontium itself has never been found to cause any harmful effects, except in one province in Turkey where some children developed rickets because strontium intake was very high and calcium intake was deficient. The treatment prescribed was calcium supplements. Supplemental strontium may not be advis- able in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis because dialysis fluid is often high in strontium, and the ability of patients with CKD to clear strontium (and everything else requiring elimination in urine) is compromised. The drug strontium ranelate is not safe and should not be used. Ranelic acid was claimed to be inert, and all of it was said to disassociate from strontium in the digestive tract and to be quickly eliminated from the body. Research has now shown that none of these assertions was correct.376 Many studies have confirmed that the strontium ions in strontium ranelate, not ranelic acid, are doing the bone-beneficial work. The many adverse side effects (ADRs) attributed to strontium, ranging from commonly seen ADRs like nau- sea and skin irritation to potentially deadly effects, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE) and myocardial infarction (MI), and serious autoimmune reactions (e.g., drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS], Stevens–Johnson syndrome [SJS], and toxic epi- dermal necrolysis [TEN]), are caused by immune reactions to ranelic acid (the ranelate anion in strontium ranelate), not strontium. The use of strontium ranelate has never been approved in the United States and is now significantly restricted in Europe, whereas strontium citrate is freely available.377-379 Note that the bisphosphonates and denosumab may also cause the cutaneous ADRs seen with strontium ranelate: “Review of available evidence shows that cutaneous adverse reactions occur with all commonly used antiosteoporotic agents. Notably, there are reports of SJS and TEN for the bisphosphonates as well as of DRESS and TEN for strontium ranelate.”380,381 Strontium and calcium com- pete for absorption. These minerals share a common carrier system in the intestinal wall, which preferentially transports calcium rather than strontium into the circulation.382 Strontium’s active intestinal absorp- tion, like calcium’s, requires vitamin D, and just as with calcium, the ability to absorb strontium decreases with age. Like calcium, strontium is a bone-seeking mineral and incorporates into both trabecular and cortical bone. Strontium, however, deposits almost entirely into new trabecular bone, with one strontium ion substituting for less than calcium ion out of 10.374 Strontium improves healthy bone mineral- ization: apatite crystals containing strontium are more stable and show more regular shapes.383 Strontium is almost twice as large as calcium, and its larger mass affects DXA readings. Available data indicate that approximately 50% of the increase seen in BMD over 3 years of treat- ment with strontium is due to strontium’s larger mass, which also means that 50% of the increase seen in BMD is accurate. Strontium’s larger mass than calcium also affects how quickly strontium is elim- inated from the body. Both calcium and strontium are primarily excreted by the kidneys, but strontium’s greater mass makes its reab- sorption more difficult, so three times as much strontium is excreted in urine compared with calcium.374,382,384 Even the tiny number of stron- tium-for-calcium ions exchanged in bones—one strontium ion replac- ing less than 1 calcium ion out of 10—has a major beneficial impact on bones’ health, strength, and flexibility. Strontium’s beneficial effects are not due to its replacing calcium in bone. They are the result of strontium’s bone-building effects on a very wide range of key molecules involved in bone remodeling. Strontium increases our ability to absorb and deposit calcium in our bones374,382,385; regulates RANKL and OPG activity386,387; activates Wnt signaling, which plays a crucial role in osteoblast production and bone formation; boosts the rate at which osteoblasts differentiate and their survival,386 preventing the increased rate of bone turnover induced by ovariectomy in animal studies (the model for human menopause)374,388; improves mineralization and hydroxyapatite formation386; increases the number of bone-forming

sites (osteoblast and osteoid surfaces)386; improves bones’ mechani- cal resistance to fracture370,383,389; inhibits osteoclast production and activity386; increases the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts386; increases the maturation rate of these preosteoblasts and the activity of mature osteoblasts; increases the rate at which osteoblasts lay down minerals to form new bone; and increases the production of osteocal- cin.386 If osteopenia or osteoporosis is present, the standard 680-mg/d dose of strontium citrate is recommended. To maintain skeletal health long term, a dose of 340 mg/d is likely to be adequate.390,391 Just as with calcium, a lower dose of strontium (340 mg) taken twice daily may be more effectively absorbed, but because bone remodeling is thought to ramp up at night, if 680 mg/d is taken once daily, it should be taken at night.384,392,393 Calcium-containing foods and supplements should be avoided for at least 2 hours before or after taking strontium, as should medications that interfere with strontium absorption (e.g., calcium-containing antacids, oral tetracyclines, quinolone antibiotics, antacids that contain aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide, and chelating agents, such as DMSA). Human ability to absorb stron- tium is optimized by the preceding plus (1) ensuring intake of vitamin D 3 is adequate and (2) minimizing consumption of processed foods because all contain phosphate additives, which interfere with stron- tium absorption.382

## Vitamins


Vitamin D is required for the active absorption of calcium. Without sufficient vitamin D, only 10% to 15% of the calcium consumed will be absorbed. Liver and kidney health affect our ability to utilize vitamin D (D 3 or D 2 ),234 which must be converted to 25(OH)D in the liver and then to its hormonal form of 1,25-D in the kidneys to enable cal- cium absorption.394-398 Impaired conversion of vitamin D to 25(OH) D is surprisingly common due to NAFLD. Compared with premeno- pausal women, postmenopausal women have a 205% greater risk for NAFLD.399 When evaluating patients for NAFLD, bear in mind that recent findings have shown that individuals with normal alanine ami- notransferase (ALT) levels may still have NAFLD. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ultrasonography, two noninvasive methods of diagnosing NAFLD that provide more accu- rate results than ALT levels alone, are now recommended.400,401 Daily dosing is far more effective due to the differing amounts of time that the three forms of vitamin D (D 3 , 25[OH]D) and 1,25-D) remain available for use within the body. Vitamin D 3 consumed in a bolus dose that is not used within 12 to 24 hours is excreted in bile, feces, and urine. In addition, D 3 plays a number of key roles that 25(OH) D cannot and therefore must be supplied daily.402,403 The only way to sustain needed amounts of vitamin D in the bloodstream is by either daily D 3 supplementation and/or daily sunlight exposure (at the right ultraviolet [UV] wavelength). D 2 is not nearly as effective as D 3 in rais- ing or maintaining 25(OH)D status.404-409 Some experts recommend a blood level of 25(OH)D of 40 to 60 ng/mL; others think it should be 50 to 80 ng/mL. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) thinks 20 ng/mL is adequate, but no other authorities agree with this.234,410-413 To reduce cancer risk, studies indicate that a 25(OH)D status of 60 to 80 ng/mL may be needed.414 The lowest dose of vitamin D now recommended by the Endocrine Society for healthy adults, whose blood levels of vitamin D are at least 30 ng/mL, is 1500 to 2000 IU/d. The Vitamin D Council recommends 5000 IU/d for 3 months, then testing blood levels of 25(OH)D.415 A high body weight increases the amount of vitamin D needed.416,417 Individuals with sarcopenia (i.e., those who are overfat) may also require higher doses of vitamin D, as may those whose genetic inheritance includes the vitamin D–related SNPs discussed previously under “Risk Factors.”418 A number of other factors also affect vitamin D needs, including latitude (north of 35° latitude, especially above the 37th parallel, increases risk of vitamin D deficiency), typical amount of sun exposure, use of sunscreen, age (older adults require more),419 skin color (individuals of African heritage tend to produce less D 3 from sun exposure and have lower levels of 25(OH)D but also tend to have a more effective vitamin D–binding protein and thus higher BMD than Caucasians),420-422 diet, and ability to absorb fats (vitamin D is fat soluble).423,424 Vitamin D is nowhere near as toxic as once thought.425-427 A few uncommon health conditions may cause hypercalcemia when taking vitamin D: sarcoidosis, Williams–Beuren syndrome, some lympho- mas, and a genetic disorder resulting in the production of an inactive 1,25-D, 24-hydroxylase (or CYP24A1), the enzyme that prepares the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-D for elimination. If not suffering from one of these uncommon health conditions, extremely high doses of vitamin D (e.g., 50,000–100,000 IU daily) would need to be taken for months for vitamin D levels to become toxic. The Endocrine Society’s practice guidelines for vitamin D supplementation state that vitamin D intoxication (hypercalcemia) is usually not observed until blood levels of 25(OH)D are higher than 150 ng/mL. However, it’s best to err on the side of safety and keep 25(OH)D levels below 100 ng/mL, which is thought to be the uppermost range of normal.

In addition to involvement in blood clotting, vitamin K 1 (phylloqui- none) exerts significant anti-inflammatory and thus bone-protective effects. K 1 is the required cofactor for enzymes involved in blood clot formation, for which reason, any K 1 consumed will first be triaged to activate these proteins. Only when short-term survival needs are met will any remaining K 1 be converted into K 2 and used to activate the vitamin K–dependent proteins (VKDPs) involved in calcium reg- ulation: osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein.428-431 To promote bone health, K 1 intake should be at least 1000 mcg/d, which can easily be provided by a diet that includes lots of leafy greens, such as kale, spin- ach, Swiss chard, collards, parsley, and broccoli.432,433 K 1 is also pres- ent in plant oils, especially unhydrogenated soybean and canola oils. Partially hydrogenated oils and processed foods contain an abnormal form of K 1 , called dihydrophylloquinone, which is neither absorbed nor utilized well, even to produce clotting factors, and is not converted into K 2 .434,435 Healthful absorption and use of calcium require both vitamin D and vitamin K 2 . Reviews claiming that calcium, with or without vitamin D, increases risk for heart attack, does not prevent falls, or does not lessen the risk of fracture ignore this fact of human physi- ology. In none of the studies cited in any of these articles is vitamin K 2 even considered.436,437 Insufficiency of K 2 increases the risk of heart attacks, osteoporosis, and fracture.438 In quantities sufficient for bone health, vitamin K 2 is only found in one—unpalatable in the Western diet—food, a Japanese fermented soybean product called natto. A few cheeses fermented by K 2 -producing bacteria provide tiny amounts of K 2 : English blue cheese, Swiss Emmental, and Norwegian Jarlsberg. K 2 is also present, but in insignificant amounts, in liver, meat, and egg yolks.439-441 Considering nutrient levels in the foods commonly eaten, to meet bones’ needs for vitamin K 2 , a supplement is required.442 For most, the supplemental form of K 2 that is, by far, the most helpful is MK-7, although for a minority of people, MK-4 may be better. MK-4 is structurally almost identical to vitamin K 1 . Both are treated the same way in the body. After clotting needs have been met in the liver, MK-4 and K1 are put into triglycerides before being sent into the bloodstream and are cleared from the body within 6 to 8 hours. MK-7 is preferentially used to activate VKDPs out- side the liver (e.g., osteocalcin, matrix Gla protein) and is absorbed

## 1654SECTION 6 Diseases

into low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) before being sent into the bloodstream. LDL-C circulates in the bloodstream for sev- eral days before it is cleared, giving MK-7 a much longer half-life than K 1 and MK-4. The half-life of K 1 and MK-4 is 6 to 8 hours, whereas the half-life of MK-7 is 96 hours or 4 days. When MK-7 is consumed daily, a reserve of K 2 is produced that enables continuous activation of VKDPs. MK-7’s much longer availability explains why a very small dose—as little as 100 micrograms per day—may be all that is needed.443,444 The dose of MK-4 used in the research showing benefit for people with osteopenia or osteoporosis is 15 mg t.i.d.—a dose that could not possibly be consumed from the diet. Nonetheless, a small percentage of individuals do better on MK-4: the few who have inherited infrequently seen genetic variations that enable them to retain and recycle vitamin K far longer than “average.” The majority (85%–95%) will find that vitamin K 2 in its MK-7 form at a dose of 100 to 180 mcg/d per day is adequate. Those individuals whose genetic inheritance includes SNPs in APOE, VKOR, CCGX, or CYP4F2 that result in their clearing vitamin K more quickly than “average” will definitely need the MK-7 form and will benefit from a larger daily dose than the 100 to 180 mcg/d per day sufficient for the needs of the “average” person. Those among the small number of individuals whose genetic inheritance enables them to retain vita- min K around longer than “average” may find that less MK-7 (45 micrograms per day or every other day) or the MK-4 in a dose of mg bid is effective.445-452 K 2 intake must be in balance with that of D 3 , which increases both the body’s ability to absorb calcium and its production of the VKDPs that regulate calcium’s use. If D 3 needs are met with 1000 to 2000 IU/d, then K 2 needs are likely to be 100 to mcg/d; D 3 intake of 3000 to 4000 IU/d may require 200 to 300 mcg/d of MK-7; D 3 intake of 5000 IU/d or more may require 360 mcg/d of MK-7, which is still an extremely safe dose. Vitamin K is so safe that the IOM has set no Upper Tolerable Limit for any form of vitamin K for those not taking blood thinners whose mechanisms of action is impairment of vitamin K metabolism.453-456 Two laboratory tests (uncarboxylated osteocalcin [unOC] and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein [unMGP]) can be used to verify if vitamin K needs are met. The only safety issue is in patients taking warfarin, who must avoid all vitamin K 2 supplements. Vitamin K 2 can, however, be taken along with two newer types of anticoagulant drugs, the Xa inhibitors and the direct thrombin inhibitors. Because warfarin causes vascular calcification and bone loss, switching to one of these newer drugs is recommended.101,457-470


Vitamin A has been accused of promoting bone loss. However, this only happens when not in balance with vitamin D. Human clinical studies consistently show that vitamin A in balance with vitamin D is highly beneficial, not harmful, to bone. A high intake of vitamin A combined with a low intake of vitamin D is what favors a decrease in BMD and an increase in risk for fracture. On the other hand, a high intake of vita- min D combined low intake of vitamin A promotes hypercalcemia and soft tissue calcification.471-481 Vitamin D requires vitamin A in order to effectively bind to cellular DNA, so as vitamin D increase, so does the body’s need for vitamin A. The joining together of vitamin A and vita- min D to form a heterodimer that binds to DNA is what fully triggers genes to initiate the production of a very large number of proteins and enzyme precursors, including, for example, osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, and a lack of either vitamin D or vitamin A will compromise their production. Even if vitamin K 2 is present in adequate amounts, its ability to help build bone will be impaired if either vitamin D or vitamin A is lacking because far less osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein will be available.481 Vitamin D increases the production of matrix Gla protein, whereas vitamin A slightly decreases its production. The end result is that enough, but not too much, matrix Gla protein is produced. This is highly important for bone health because matrix Gla protein and osteocalcin compete for carboxylation by the available vitamin K 2 . For the calcium whose absorption is boosted by vitamin D to be delivered to bone, sufficient K 2 must be free to carboxylate osteocalcin. Plus, enough K 2 must be available to carboxylate matrix Gla protein to prevent calcium from depositing in the vasculature or kidneys. If too much matrix Gla protein is produced with the “help” of vitamin D unopposed by vitamin A, insufficient K 2 will be available to activate it, and not only will calcium not be delivered to bone (because osteocalcin will not be carboxylated either), but also inactive matrix Gla protein will accumulate in blood vessels and kidneys and promote unhealthy calcification in these tissues along with bone loss. By slightly lessening the production of matrix Gla protein, vitamin A ensures sufficient K 2 is available to activate osteocalcin, so the calcium that vitamin D helps us absorb goes into bone, not blood vessels or kidneys. When balanced by vitamin D, vitamin A activates osteoclasts just enough to remove old or compromised bone, initiating the remodeling process. Vitamin A also balances the calcium-absorbing actions of vitamin D by increasing the urinary excretion of excess calcium, both the calcium liberated from soft tissues by matrix Gla protein (activated by vitamin K 2 ) and the cal- cium released from bone by osteoclasts. For these reasons, high doses of unopposed vitamin D may cause a functional vitamin A deficiency and promote calcification of soft tissues and the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones.241,243,482-497 When the vitamin D–vitamin A heterodimer is present, even a defective VDR performs significantly better. Because the genetic inheritance of 34% to 44% of Caucasians and 24% to 36% of African Americans includes a faulty VDR, vitamin A’s importance for bone health in a large percentage of the popula- tion cannot be overstated.498-501 Vitamin A is required for immune tolerance, without which, the immune system becomes hyperactive, promoting the development of autoimmune diseases (e.g., allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s and Graves thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis, etc.) and bone loss. A hyperactive immune system, constantly producing highly inflamma- tory agents to destroy what it misperceives as threats, creates a state of systemic chronic inflammation that excessively activates osteoclasts, causing bone loss.502-507,645 Beta-carotene does not provide balance for the actions of vitamin D, prevent vitamin D toxicity, or help opti- mize vitamin D’s healthful effects. Most humans do a very poor job of converting beta-carotene into vitamin A. The enzyme 15,15 ′ -mono- oxygenase (BCMO1) is responsible for converting beta-carotene to vitamin A. Six very common SNPs result in the production of a slow to almost completely ineffective BCMO1. Virtually everyone has inher- ited at least one of these six SNPs, but even the few who have inherited the SNPs that produce a BCMO1 enzyme able to make the conversion will only convert a small portion of the beta-carotene they consume into vitamin A.508-511 In addition, vitamin A insufficiency is widespread for a number of other factors. About 70% to 90% of dietary vitamin A is absorbed, but even under optimal circumstances, only 3% or less of the beta-carotene or other carotenoids are absorbed.512 Despite being a fat-soluble nutrient, under normal conditions, 5% of vitamin A stores are lost daily. Large variations in the concentration of provitamin A carotenoids in foods are typical—even in the same type of food—due to varietal differences, stage of maturity when harvested, climate con- ditions, and processing and/or cooking.513 Cofactors required for the conversion of beta-carotene to vitamin A may not be available. The enzyme BMCO1, which converts beta-carotene to vitamin A, does so as one of three steps, which require bile acids and iron. Furthermore, the form of vitamin A produced from beta-carotene, retinal, has to

## 1655CHAPTER 203 Osteoporosis

be further metabolized by several other enzymes to be converted into retinol. These enzymes require riboflavin, niacin, and zinc as cofac- tors.512 Bile flow is compromised by acute and chronic liver diseases, including NAFLD, which is now estimated to be present in as many as 46% of the U.S. population and 35% of the population worldwide.514 A number of drugs deplete vitamin A, including aluminum-containing antacids; cholesterol-lowering agents, including bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (e.g., Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar, Olestyr) and colestipol (e.g., Colestid, Cholestabyl), which reduce fat absorption and thus the absorption of vitamin A and other fat-soluble nutrients (e.g., vitamin D and vitamin K); colchine, which is used to treat gout and impairs vitamin A absorption by blocking the release of retinol-binding protein; and sucralfate (e.g., Carafate, Sulcrate), which is used to treat duodenal ulcers and GERD and decreases the absorp- tion of all the fat-soluble nutrients515; fat malabsorption, food intol- erances, hypochlorhydria, and exposure to liver toxins (e.g., carbon tetrachloride, which forms when surfactants are mixed with chlorine bleach, impairs vitamin A metabolism)516; and lastly, supplementation with increasingly high doses of vitamin D without either vitamin A or K 2 . Intake of vitamin D and vitamin A should be approximately equiv- alent.479-481,483-485,517,518 Vitamin D increases production of the VKDPs, so the need for a higher intake of vitamin D 3 indicates the need for a higher intake of vitamin K 2 , as well as sufficient vitamin A to maintain balance with D 3 . In those who require 1000 to 2000 IU of vitamin D 3 per day, 1000 to 2000 IU of vitamin A and 100 to 120 micrograms of vitamin K 2 in the form of MK-7 per day should maintain balance. Those who require 5000 IU of vitamin D 3 per day will need ∼ 5000 IU of vitamin A and 180 to 200 mcg/d of MK-7. Anyone requiring 10,000 IU of D 3 /d and taking a comparable amount (10,000 IU) of vitamin A should be getting 360 mcg/d of MK-7, which is the K 2 dosage being used in the current research involving postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and men and women with coronary artery disease and CKD. No adverse events have been reported in any of the studies.453 When taken in balance with vitamin D 3 , and not consumed in exces- sive amounts (excess in adults = greater than 10,000 IU per day total from food and supplements combined), vitamin A is safe, exerts many beneficial effects on our bones, and promotes immune tolerance. If not balanced by comparable intake of vitamin D 3 , vitamin A intake greater than 3000 IU/d may increase loss of BMD and risk of fracture in older people. The UL for vitamin A in adults (19 years and older) is 10,000 IU/d. Although 10,000 IU is also the UL given for vitamin A for preg- nant or breastfeeding women, err on the side of caution. A safer UL may be 5000 IU/d, total, from both food and supplements. However, most if not all of the vitamin A safety studies have been done in the context of vitamin D deficiency. An adequate supply of vitamin A is especially important for pregnant women for normal fetal development and for women who are breastfeeding for healthy postnatal development. The adverse effects of vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy cannot be compensated for by postnatal supplementation. Synthetic retinoids (i.e., the acne and antiwrinkle drug isotretinoin) should be avoided; its potential adverse effects far outweigh any benefit.519,520

The B vitamins work together to optimize methylation, prevent ele- vated levels of homocysteine, and promote the production of SAMe and glutathione. In their active forms, the B vitamins also play an essential role in the production and recycling of thyroid hormones, conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and EPA to DHA, recycling glutathione and vitamin K, absorption of magnesium, and produc- tion of endothelial nitric oxide. Because of the high-incidence SNPs resulting in slower versions of the enzymes involved in B vitamin acti- vation, a full-spectrum B complex providing the B vitamins in their active forms is recommended (i.e., pyridoxal-5-phosphate, methylco- balamin, methyltetrehydrafolate, flavin mononucleotide, and/or flavin adenine dinucleotide).521-533,644


By directly disarming both ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), vitamin C lessens free-radical damage, protecting against the develop- ment of excessive osteoclast activation caused by chronic inflammation. In addition, vitamin C recycles other antioxidants, including vitamin E and glutathione, further increasing our ability to disarm free radi- cals.534,535 With aging, not only does the ability to produce glutathione decline, but also the needs for it increase, particularly in women when the loss of estrogen production that occurs with menopause results in an increased amount of both ROS and RNS, increased production of osteoclasts, and increased bone resorption. In animal studies, this entire scenario is completely reversed by supplementing laboratory rats with vitamin C, which increases glutathione concentrations.536-541 Vitamin C’s antioxidant activities also inhibit the production of other proinflammatory compounds, including the highly inflammatory sig- naling molecules of the prostaglandin E2 series.542 Vitamin C improves blood sugar control. A review of 22 studies including 937 participants found that supplemental vitamin C (dose per day averaged 1000 mg but ranged from 500 to as much as 6000 mg/d) significantly improved blood sugar control and lowered blood sugar levels. Vitamin C was found to lower blood levels of glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A 1c — all of which have been shown to inversely correlate with bone den- sity.543 Vitamin C is the cofactor for the dioxygenase enzymes, which are required for collagen biosynthesis. Because more than 90% of the protein in the bone matrix is collagen, vitamin C is an essential nutri- ent for healthy bone.544,545 Vitamin C stimulates MSC production and then triggers the expression of genes involved in MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and chondrocytes instead of lipocytes.546-549 Vitamin C also triggers the expression of genes in osteoblasts that are involved in the formation of trabecular bone and promotes gene signaling in mature osteoblasts that results in their increased activity and longev- ity.549 Vitamin C is especially important for smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke because it greatly increases the amount of nic- otine required to inhibit osteoblast development and production of a number of proteins involved in bone formation.550 Vitamin C, particu- larly supplemental vitamin C, lowers risk of hip and other osteoporotic fractures. Framingham data showed that those in the highest tertile of supplemental vitamin C intake (average intake of 260 mg/d) had a 69% lower risk of hip fracture.545 The dietary reference intakes for vitamin C are 75 mg/d for adult women and 90 mg/d for adult men. An additional 35 mg/d is recommended for smokers because many toxic compounds in cigarette smoke rapidly deplete vitamin C. During pregnancy, the RDI is increased to 85 mg/d and further increased to 120 mg/d when breastfeeding.551 These RDIs are grossly inadequate. Vitamin C is used up far more rapidly not just in acute illness but also in chronic inflam- mation, which affects the majority of Americans over age 50 and plays a major role in osteoporosis.534,552,553 If we consider an evolutionary perspective for guidance, our prehistoric ancestors are thought to have consumed 2.3 g/d or more of vitamin C.554 Many of today’s leading clinicians believe doses ranging from 1000 to 2000 mg/d are optimal for most people. And this level of vitamin C intake is quite safe: the UL (tolerable upper limit) for vitamin C is 3000 mg/d, and the research suggests that intakes up to 4000 mg/d are well tolerated in the general population (per conversation with Dr. Joseph Pizzorno, based upon his 40+ years of experience in treating many thousands of patients; in writing The Textbook of Natural Medicine, now in its 5th edition; as editor of the PubMed listed journal, Integrative Medicine: A Clinician’s Journal, and in daily review of breaking research).555 Our needs for

vitamin C increase with age, in part because of more inflammation but also because aging liver cells produce fewer of the proteins that help transport vitamin C around the body (the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters or SVCTs) than do the liver cells of younger individu- als. In animal studies, production of a key type of SVCT declines 45% with age.556,557 In addition, polymorphisms in SNPs rs33972313 in the SLC23A1 gene (either GA or AA) result in the production of less effective SCVTs, increasing vitamin C needs.558,559 Ascorbic acid is the least expensive form of supplemental vitamin C and is well tolerated by most individuals. Even those who are sensitive to this very weak “acid” are unlikely to experience gas or loose stools when taking three to six smaller doses of ∼ 200 mg throughout the day. Furthermore, the fractional absorption of vitamin C is 100% at a dose of 200 mg but decreases as the dose increases. When 1250 mg is taken all at once, less than 50% is absorbed.560 No other safety issues exist. Vitamin C does not promote oxalate and kidney stone formation. The finding of high levels of oxalates in the urine with consumption of large doses of vitamin C has been revealed to be a laboratory artifact, the result of a method that converts vitamin C in the test sample to oxalate during analysis of the urine. In other words, vitamin C converts to oxalate in the laboratory col- lection bottle (i.e., after it has left the body). Vitamin C’s effects while in the body all counteract stone formation. Vitamin C is not a proo- xidant561,562 and does not excessively increase iron absorption, cause rebound scurvy,563 lower levels of B 12 ,564 or increase uric acid produc- tion and risk of gout.565,566 Vitamin C should not be taken for at least 2 hours before or after taking propranolol. Taking 2 g of vitam71in C 30 minutes before taking propranolol (a beta-blocker) was found to reduce its bioavailability.567 Also, do not take vitamin C at the same time as tetracycline. Administration of 500 mg of vitamin C along with 250 mg of tetracycline was found to increase the blood level of the drug by 3- to 15-fold after 2 hours.567 Lastly, large doses of vitamin C may increase the dosage of warfarin required. Only two case reports have suggested this possibility, but err on the side of caution. For the best absorption of vitamin C, smaller doses (250–500 mg) should be used several times a day anyway, and this amount has never been suggested to interfere with warfarin dosage.567


Vitamin E is a family of 8 isomers, not just α -tocopherol. Most vita- min E supplements contain only α -tocopherol; many contain dL- α -to- copherol, a synthetic (less expensive, racemic) version of α -tocopherol, which is less biologically active than natural (RRR) α -tocopherol.568 For numerous reasons, the vitamin E supplement chosen to support bone health should contain all eight natural vitamin E isomers (i.e., “mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols”). High-dose α -tocopherol alone is not only less effective but can increase inflammation and promote bone loss: High dose α -tocopherol suppresses blood levels of γ -tocoph- erol, the vitamin E isomer most abundant in vitamin E–rich foods, by 30% to 70%.569,570 Vitamin E–rich foods contain five times as much γ -tocopherol as α -tocopherol, and γ -tocopherol is a more potent anti-inflammatory agent than α -tocopherol. Mammals must neutralize two basic types of free radicals: ROS and RNS. α -Tocopherol can dis- arm ROS, but γ -tocopherol is required to defuse RNS. γ -Tocopherol is a much more potent inhibitor than α -tocopherol of two key enzymes responsible for inflammation, cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX). γ -Tocopherol increases levels of an anti-inflammatory signal- ing molecule called PPAR γ more than twice as effectively as α -tocoph- erol. γ -tocopherol, but not α -tocopherol, lowers levels of CRP, a key marker of inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease and bone loss. Supplementation with α -tocopherol alone may dysregulate key detoxification enzymes and immune function, further promoting inflammation. α -Tocopherol becomes a pro-oxidant if not accompa- nied by other antioxidants to recycle it. α -Tocopherol alone stimulates osteoclast activity and bone resorption. α -Tocopherol alone decreases blood levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase and interferes with the physiological function of vitamin K, increasing the rate at which vita- min K is excreted and inhibiting its activation of osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein.571-579 Human clinical trials show that mixed tocopherols are more effective than any single tocopherol against oxidative stress and inflammation.580-582 Natural vitamin E (mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols) promotes healthy bones by neutralizing both ROS and RNS free radicals and lessening inflammation and by increasing acti- vation of anti-inflammatory PPARs, a family of proteins that control when genes are switched on or off and inhibit key inflammatory sig- naling cascades, including the NF κ B pathway, the pathway that is the target of denosumab (Prolia, Xgeva). Vitamin E also inhibits this path- way, but unlike denosumab, it has no adverse effects.571,572,583 Natural vitamin E (mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols) has been shown to increase BMD and to lower the risk of sarcopenia and dementia as well as osteoporosis.584-589 Animal studies suggest natural vitamin E may be especially helpful for men with osteoporosis.590 The RDI only covers α -tocopherol and is far too low: RDA = 15 mg (or 22 IU of natural α -tocopherol or 16 IU of synthetic dL- α -tocopherol). The tolerable UL was set at 1000 mg/d for either natural (RRR) or synthetic (racemic) supplemental α -tocopherol.534,591-593 The most current papers on vita- min E argue that the scientific evidence is strong enough to recommend daily intakes of at least 150 IU of α -tocopherol per day.594 A solid body of peer-reviewed medical literature has demonstrated that vitamin E is safe in amounts up to 1600 IU/d.555,595 Individuals not regularly con- suming vitamin E–rich foods are likely to be deficient. In several stud- ies, more than 40% of elderly individuals (aged 65–98 years) were not even consuming the RDI. Data show that elderly humans (age 65 and older) whose diets provide more than five times the RDI of vitamin E (a dose of mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols of ∼ 550 IU/d) had signifi- cantly better immune responses and increased resistance to infectious diseases compared with nonsupplemented controls.592 To support the health of both bones and immune system, 400 to 800 IU of mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols should be consumed daily. The vitamin E supplement you recommend should provide the full complement of mixed tocopherols and tocotrienols with a 5:1 ratio of γ -tocopherol to α -tocopherol. Needs for γ -tocopherol are increased in individuals taking a nitrogen-bisphosphonate (e.g., Fosamax, Boniva) because these drugs greatly depress levels of both γ -tocopherol and coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ).596 A solid body of peer-reviewed medical literature has demonstrated that natural vitamin E (mixed tocopherols and tocotrie- nols) is safe in amounts up to 1600 IU/d.555

## Omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids

ALA, EPA, and DHA lower osteoclast-activating chronic inflammation because they are metabolized by the same enzymes as the potentially proinflammatory omega-6 essential fatty acid, arachidonic acid. In addi- tion, the omega-3s promote bone formation by signaling that directs MSCs to develop into osteoblasts rather than adipocytes. In young indi- viduals, inflammation is interpreted by MSCs as a signal to produce more osteoblasts and more bone.82,83 With aging, if the supply of omega-3s is out of balance with that of omega-6s, MSCs preferentially develop into adipocytes, promoting sarcopenia.597,598 When sufficient EPA/DHA is consumed daily to result in a ratio of omega-6:omega-3 of no greater than 4:1, metabolism shifts to one that favors an anti-inflammatory response, prevents chronic low-grade inflammation, quickly resolves acute inflammation, puts a damper on the production of osteoclasts, and encourages MSCs to become osteoblasts rather than adipocytes. The ratio of omega-6:omega-3 typically seen in the modern Western diet is

20:1 and promotes inflammation and sarcopenia. Supplemental EPA/ DHA is recommended because even if intake of ALA-rich plant foods is high, humans are able to convert only a very small amount of the ALA in plant foods into EPA and DHA, a conversion that is further reduced by 40% to 50% when the diet is rich in omega-6-oils, as is the SAD. In actuality, less than 0.1% to 0.2% of the ALA consumed is converted into arachidonic acid (AA).599-604 Men do an especially poor job of con- verting ALA to EPA/DHA, producing far less than women, who are more capable of producing EPA/DHA from ALA because DHA is essen- tial for fetal brain development and brain function.605-607 Cold, deep- water, wild-caught fish are the best dietary sources of EPA/DHA, but at least two servings of fish every day would need to be consumed to ingest the 2.6 g/d of EPA/DHA needed for healthy bones. If the wild-caught fish is large, it may contain unsafe levels of bone-destructive mercury, which accumulates in fish in a form that is water soluble and highly bio- available.156,608 Mercury deposits in the kidneys, promoting bone loss because the kidneys are the primary location in which 25(OH)D is con- verted to 1,25-D. Farmed fish are not a good source of omega-3s because their feed is high in omega-6 oils, resulting in their flesh containing high levels of AA. For all these reasons, supplemental EPA/DHA is recom- mended. To attain a ratio of omega-6:omega-3 of at least 4:1, preferably lower (2:1),83,609-615 the consumption of 1 g of omega-3 for every 4 g of omega-6 in the diet is required. The “average” daily intake of omega-6 in the United States is 20 g/d, whereas the average intake of EPA and DHA, from both food and supplements, is barely 1 g/d of EPA/DHA, so an additional 3 to 4 g/d of EPA/DHA is needed to support omega-3’s beneficial effects on bone, and APOE4 carriers are616-620 likely to require even higher doses to receive benefit.621,622 Omega-3s in their natural tri- glyceride form are significantly more effectively absorbed (EPA 3.4-fold better and DHA 2.7-fold better) and utilized than ethyl esters (EEs) or synthetic triglycerides (rTG).623-625


The skeletal and the muscular systems are tightly intertwined: the strongest mechanical forces applied to bones are those created by mus- cle contractions, which condition bone density, strength, and microar- chitecture. Not surprisingly, sarcopenia decreases bone strength; fortunately, it’s very responsive to progressive resistance training, espe- cially in elders. Improvements in strength up to 200% are not unusual in just a few months, although the increase in muscle mass is usually only ∼ 10% in older adults.626 By stressing muscles, which stress bones, exercise activates osteocytes, long-lived cells—their average half-life is 25 years—that form a signaling network in bone that, similar to the nervous system, transmits signals that direct and properly balance the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteocytes tend to die off with aging, especially if they are not stimulated by mechanotransduc- tion (i.e., exercise).627 Studies of limb loading in animals show that although mechanical stress results in very small gains in total bone, these gains occur where bone is subjected to the most strain (i.e., where bone is most likely to fracture). The end result is a greater than 100- fold increase in “fatigue resistance” (the highest stress that the bone material can withstand for a given number of cycles without break- ing), despite a much smaller absolute gain in bone mass. In addition, in response to exercise, osteocyte signaling increases the pool of MSCs, halts the secretion of sclerostin, and increases that of proteins involved in Wnt signaling. Sclerostin inhibits the development of osteoblasts and bone formation. Wnt signaling promotes the production of both osteoblasts and myocytes.628,629 How important is this? The newest pharmaceutical agent in the pipe- line, Romosozumab, was created to be a patentable antibody to sclerostin. Its ADRs already include increased risk of vascular calcification, stroke, and “cardiovascular “events” (e.g., myocardial infarction), along with a potentially increased risk of cancer.630 By improving muscle strength and balance and combating sarcopenia, regular exercise, particularly when vitamin D levels are adequate, also lowers the risk of falls, which greatly increase the risk of fragility fractures.631-633 One reason for this is that muscle fiber membranes are richly supplied with vitamin D receptors, whose exposure to vitamin D triggers muscle protein synthesis. The IOM still claims the evidence is not sufficient for vitamin D’s importance in preventing sarcopenia; in Europe, however, a panel of experts determined vitamin D level of at least 30 to 44 ng/mL is necessary for musculoskeletal health.626 Exercise increases bone diameter throughout the life span, fur- ther diminishing fracture risk by mechanically counteracting the age-as- sociated thinning of bones and increases in bone porosity.632 Prospective and case-control studies show that, compared with sedentary individuals, those who engage in regular, vigorous physical activity are 20% to 40% less likely to suffer a hip fracture.634 The Nurses’ Health Study found that active women with a minimum of 24 MET-hours per week had a 55% lower risk of hip fracture compared with sedentary women getting less than 3.635 Although well-designed, carefully supervised exercise trials have failed to show any absolute gain in bone mass in dedicated exercisers, a number have reported a halting of further age-related bone loss.636-639 The deciding factor that determines whether or not exercise halts bone loss appears to be calcium. Substantial evidence shows that individuals who consume low levels of calcium have lower bone mass (and greater risk of fracture) than age-matched individuals who consume adequate or higher levels of calcium. These findings have been documented in ado- lescents and young as well as older women. In addition, it’s thought that physically active people may need more calcium to support the increased bone formation potentially stimulated by physical activity. This increased need has been suggested as the reason why the research on exercise and bone formation shows such inconsistent results. The lack of bone build- ing in response to exercise is thought to be due to the higher levels of calcium needed were not available.640 In the research overall, in exercise studies in which calcium intakes were less than 1000 mg/d, bone forma- tion has been negligible.641 To effectively promote bone health, exercise should occur a minimum of 3 times a week for 1 hour; be dynamic; involve some impact; exceed a threshold intensity, at least 70% but pref- erably 85% of maximal capacity; exceed a threshold strain frequency; involve short bouts of intense exercise with less intense recovery peri- ods; impose an unusual loading pattern on the bones; and be combined with optimal nutritional support: protein, calcium, D 3 , K 2 , magnesium, boron, and other trace minerals. For those individuals with osteoporosis, impact-producing exercises and those that involve spinal flexion should be avoided to prevent injuries.636 A warning: hormonal contraceptives prevent normal estrogen and progesterone production, thus preventing normal bone mass accretion in young women. Suppression of normal age-related increases in BMD have been documented in oral contraceptive users who completed a 2-year exercise program, and the age at which oral contraceptive use was initiated is the most significant predictor of low spinal bone mass in female endurance athletes.642,643 These findings have serious impli- cations for the ability of young women—even those who exercise regu- larly—to achieve the peak bone mass they must have to avoid the early onset of osteoporosis.636


A whole-foods, Mediterranean-type diet is optimal for strong bones (and for virtually all other aspects of health). The diet should include organically grown plant foods whenever possible (vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and seeds), wild-caught fish, free-range eggs, and dairy and meat products from pastured animals and extra-virgin olive oil

Minimize consumption of pro- cessed foods to lessen the intake of phosphate additives, pesticide residues, nutrient-depleted highly refined carbohydrates, cadmium, excessive omega-6 fatty acids, and sodium. Ensure protein intake of 1.8 g/kg. Consider minimizing intake or recommending the avoidance of gluten if gluten sensitivity is suspected.

## Lifestyle Factors

Minimize exposure to environmental toxins. If smoking, quit, and minimize exposure to secondhand smoke. Limit alcohol consumption to no more than 2 units/d for women, units/d for men (1 unit is 12 oz of beer, 4 oz of wine, or 1 oz of liquor). Coffee, 3 to 4 cups/d, is beneficial with adequate calcium intake (1200– 1500 mg/d). Decaf is recommended for those with CYP1A2 SNPs that result in slower detoxification of caffeine. Minimize drug use. Monitor thyroid hormone levels at least annually and adjust T3/T4 dosages as indicated. Switch to less harmful pharmaceutical agents when use is necessary. Engage in weight-bearing exercise for a minimum of 3 hours/week. Encourage movement! Ideally, some type of weight-bearing exercise should be undertaken for 1 hour each day. Individuals with osteoporosis should avoid exercises that produce a forward-rounding curvature of the neck and thoracic vertebrae because this may promote “cervical wedging.” Consider heavy metals testing: lead, mercury, cadmium.

reflection of the suppressive effects antibiotics have on the immune system while also disturbing the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract.9 Because most children with acute otitis media (70%–90%) have spontaneous resolution within 7 to 14 days, antibiotics should not be the initial treatment routinely prescribed for all children.8,10 Extensive reviews of the scientific literature on the value of antibiotics in the treatment of otitis media over the past 30 years have led to the follow- ing conclusions: • The benefit of routine antimicrobial use for otitis media, judged by either short- or long-term outcomes, is unproven. • Existing research offers no compelling evidence that children with acute otitis media routinely given antimicrobials have a shorter duration of symptoms, fewer recurrences, or better long-term out- comes than those who do not receive them. • Although the prevention of mastoiditis and meningitis is a ratio- nale for antimicrobial treatment, little evidence exists that routine treatment is effective for this purpose. • Antimicrobials did not improve outcome at 2 months, and no dif- ferences in rates of recovery were found for either antimicrobial type or duration. Although these results have been accepted by some U.S. pedi- atricians, others still rely heavily on antibiotics to treat otitis media. Instead of antibiotics, the recommendation from this group of experts was to use analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) and for the caregiver to keep a close watch. Results of clinical trials have shown that more than 80% of children with acute otitis media respond to a placebo within 48 hours. Although analgesics may be of use to limit the child’s pain, they have their own toxicity profile. Therefore it is recommended that other proven pain-relieving options like botanical eardrops be used as a replacement analgesic (see later discussion). Risks of antibiotics include allergic reactions, gastric upset, acceler- ated bacterial resistance, and unfavorable changes in nasopharyngeal bacterial flora. Antibiotics not only fail to eradicate the organisms but can induce middle-ear superinfection. Moreover, antibiotic prescrib- ing can increase the rate of return office visits and the likelihood of seeking medical care for future illness.11 Additionally, studies on con- comitant antibiotic and steroid treatment have revealed poor results on long-term efficacy for chronic otitis media.12 The position of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery states that there is no evidence indicating that systemic antibiotics alone can improve treatment outcome and that these agents should not be used save the situation of an underlying systemic infection.13 According to many experts as well as the World Health Organization, we are coming dangerously close to arriving at a “postantibiotic era” in which many infectious diseases will once again become almost impossible to treat because of an overreliance on anti- biotics (see Chapter 136 for further information).14 Otitis media is typically a self-limited disease. High rates of sponta- neous resolution have been well documented in the medical literature. Three meta-analyses independently found that approximately 80% of children with acute otitis media had spontaneous clinical relief within 2 to 14 days. Some studies of children younger than 2 years of age do suggest a lower spontaneous resolution of about 30% after a few days.11 The risks and failure with antibiotics, when coupled with the high rate of spontaneous resolution and the high recurrence rate of otitis media following the insertion of ear tubes, suggest that conservative (nonantibiotic, nonsurgical) treatment alone may reduce the inci- dence of otitis media and decrease the associated yearly financial costs. To examine this concept, the authors of one study gave the caregivers of children with nonsevere acute otitis media a “safety prescription” of antibiotics to be filled only if there was no improvement within 2 days. This method of “wait and see” reduced median antibiotic prescriptions by 31%, compared with 12% in a control practice.15 Children with otitis media must be evaluated individually, and appropriate follow-up, including physician–family communication, should be devised and assured before a decision not to use these pro- cedures is made. Special circumstances in the interest of preventing hearing loss–induced developmental delays would suggest a more appropriate use of ear tubes. Finally, pneumococcal and viral vaccines have been designed but have also shown little benefit, probably due to the multifactorial nature of this condition.11 Given the inherent risks and complications, vacci- nations do not appear to be warranted at this time.

The primary risk factors for otitis media include the following1: • Day-care attendance • Wood-burning stoves • Parental smoking or exposure to other secondhand smoke • Food allergies • Not being breastfed (a) AOM(b) OME(c) NOE Fig. 204.1 Sample images from the three diagnostic categories of otitis media.

## 1661CHAPTER 204 Otitis Media

• Pacifier use11 • Previous antibiotic use • Winter season • Underlying rhinitis, cleft palate, and Down syndrome These factors share a common mechanism: abnormal eustachian tube function, which appears to be the underlying cause in virtually all cases of otitis media. The eustachian tube regulates gas pressure in the middle ear, protects the middle ear from nose and throat secre- tions and bacteria, and clears fluids from the middle ear. Swallowing causes active opening of the eustachian tube owing to the action of the surrounding muscles. Infants and small children are particularly susceptible to eustachian tube problems because the tube is smaller in diameter and more horizontal. Obstruction of the eustachian tube leads first to fluid buildup and then, if the bacteria present are pathogenic and the immune system is impaired, to bacterial infection (Fig. 204.2). Obstruction results from collapse of the tube (due to weak tissues holding the tube in place, an abnormal opening mechanism, or both), blockage with mucus in response to allergy or irritation, swelling of the mucous membrane, or infection. Otitis media may also have a genetic component. In twin studies, monozygotic twins tend to have a higher concordance rate in otitis media histories than dizygotic twins.11 Although immunoglobulin markers16 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)17 have also been a focus of research, no specific genetic associations have been elucidated thus far. Research has also shown that children with blood type A have about a 50% higher rate of infection and are susceptible to more severe and repeated bouts of ear infection. Children whose mothers are blood type A who have ear infections before 1 year of age have an astounding 2677% greater risk of having recurrent ear infections.18 Several studies have also linked otitis media with childhood obesity. This correlation has been shown for several childhood age groups and occurs independently of socioeconomic or other clinical factors.19–22 However, these studies demonstrate association rather than causation, and it is not currently clear that obesity is a risk factor for developing otitis media. One study posited that otitis media may be a factor in the development of obesity; the proposed mechanism of action is that otitis media may cause changes in taste function, specifically reduc- tion in the ability to taste sweet and salty foods, and that these changes are associated with the development of obesity.23 Given the prevalence of obesity in the United States, special consideration should be given to the successful treatment of otitis media, along with other standard dietary recommendations regarding obesity. Contemporary pesticides, such as triazines or organophosphates, possess immunotoxic properties. One study aimed to determine whether prenatal environmental exposure to these current-use pesticides was associated with otitis media during the first 2 years of life among children from the PELAGIE mother–child cohort.24 Children whose mothers reported an organic diet during pregnancy had a reduced risk of otitis media, and the presence in maternal urine of dealkylated triazine metabolites was positively associated with recurrent otitis media. In addition, passive smoking poses a significant risk for the development of otitis media, with the child’s hazard of otitis media during the first 4 years of life being associated with mother’s current smoking habits (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1,45–4.21), mother’s previous smok- ing habits (HR = 2.00, 95% CI; 1.19–3.36), and number of smokers in the home (HR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.05–1.31).25


The primary treatment goals are to ensure patency of the eusta- chian tubes and to promote drainage by identifying and address- ing causative factors.

## Bottle-Feeding

Recurrent ear infection is strongly associated with early bottle-feeding, whereas breastfeeding (for a minimum of 3 months) has a protective effect.26,27 Whether this is due to cow’s milk allergy or to the protec- tive effect of human milk against infection has not yet been conclu- sively determined. It is likely a combination of the two. In addition, bottle-feeding while a child is lying on his or her back (bottle-propping) leads to regurgitation of the bottle’s contents into the middle ear and should be avoided. Because of its high antibody content, which helps to inhibit infec- tious agents, human milk offers protection from viral (e.g., respira- tory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, or influenza A) or bacterial (e.g., S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, or H. influenzae) agents.28 The thymus gland of breastfed infants is also roughly 20 times larger than that of formula-fed infants.29

## Food Allergy

The role of allergy as the major cause of chronic otitis media has been firmly established in the research literature.30–35 Most studies show that 85% to 93% of children with chronic otitis media have allergies: 16% to inhalants only, 14% to food only, and 70% to both. Prolonged breastfeeding may prevent otitis media by the avoidance of food allergies, particularly if the mother avoids sensitizing foods (i.e., those to which she is allergic) during pregnancy and lactation. In addition to breastfeeding, the exclusion or limited consumption of the foods to which children are most commonly allergic (e.g., wheat, egg, peanuts, corn, citrus, chocolate, and dairy) is also valuable, particularly during the first 9 months. Because a child’s digestive tract is quite permeable to food antigens (especially during the first 3 months), careful control of eating patterns (e.g., no frequent repetitions of any food, avoidance of the common allergenic foods, and the introduction of new foods in a controlled manner by introducing one new food at a time and carefully watch- ing for a reaction) will reduce and prevent the development of food allergies. An allergic reaction causes blockage of the eustachian tube by two mechanisms: (1) inflammatory swelling of the mucous membranes lining the tube; and (2) inflammatory swelling of the nose, causing the “Toynbee phenomenon” (swallowing when both mouth and nose are closed, forcing air and secretions into the middle ear). The middle and inner ear are immunologically responsive, and this includes respon- siveness to food hypersensitivities.36 In chronic earaches, an allergic cause should always be considered, and the offending allergens should be determined and avoided. One illustrative study of 153 children with earaches demonstrated that 93.3% of the children were allergic to foods, inhalants, or both.30 When 119 of these children were treated with serial dilution titration therapy for inhalant sensitivities and an elimination diet for food aller- gens, 92% had improvement after 12 months. This outcome compares favorably with that of the surgically treated control group (ear tubes and, as indicated, removal of the tonsils and adenoids), which showed only a 52% response. In another study, a total of 104 children ranging in age from 1.5 to 9 years with recurrent otitis media were evaluated for food allergy by means of skin-prick testing, specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests, and food challenges.35 The results indicated a statistically significant associ- ation between food allergy and recurrent otitis media in 81 of the patients (78%). The elimination diet led to a significant amelioration of chronic otitis media in 70 of 81 patients (86%) as assessed by detailed clinical evaluation. The challenge diet with the suspected offending foods provoked a recurrence of serous otitis media in 94% of patients. The frequency distribution of allergies to individual foods is listed in Table 204.1, and the frequency distribution according to number of food allergens is listed in Table 204.2.

## Reflux

Studies strongly suggest a link between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children with otitis media, as well as adults.37,38 Research demonstrates significant improvements in disease burden from otitis media and hearing loss with acid-blocking drug therapy. In one study, 47 patients 6 months to 7 years of age, average age 18.5 months, were prescribed a 15-mg dose of lansoprazole in the morning and, depend- ing on age, ranitidine (4 mg/kg per day) or nizatidine (5 mg/kg per day) at bedtime.39 The Pediatric Reflux Finding Score, which is used to assess the severity of extraesophageal reflux via fiberoptic laryn- goscopy, showed significant improvements at visits 2 and 3. Of note, although there were improvements, there was also a high dropout rate in this study, possibly owing to medication side effects. Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium whose overgrowth causes stomach ulceration, has also been identified in effusion samples taken from patients suffering from otitis media. The presence of H. pylori in effu- sion is associated with a diagnosis of GERD. It has been postulated that this bacterium, introduced to the inner ear by reflux, may be linked to chronic otitis media, but this has not been clearly demonstrated.40,41 Pepsin and pepsinogen have also been identified in middle ear effusion and have been postulated to have been introduced by reflux, causing otitis media.42 From a naturopathic standpoint, the idea that digestive function plays a role in otitis media is important. Although the use of the med- ications mentioned previously is to be considered with caution, the use of treatments such as food allergy avoidance, a focus on healthful foods, and measures to support digestive health are likely to produce similar positive effects.

## Thymus Gland Extract

The thymus gland secretes a family of hormones that act on white blood cells to ensure their proper development and function. Studies with calf thymus extracts given orally have demonstrated impressive clinical results in various clinical conditions in children.43–45 Specifically, thy- mus extracts have been shown to improve immune function, decrease children’s food allergies, and improve a child’s resistance to chronic respiratory infections. For more information, see Chapter 136.

## Naturopathic Ear Drops

Even though most cases of otitis media resolve spontaneously, otal- gia can often persist during the period of improvement, sometimes motivating anxious parents to request unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Naturopathic botanical ear drops have been shown to be as effective as either antibiotic and anesthetic drops and offer a much less toxic approach to pain management.46,47 In a double-blind outpatient trial, one group from Israel stud- ied 171 children ages 5 to 18 who were randomly assigned to receive treatment with naturopathic herbal extract ear drops (NHEDs) or anesthetic ear drops (amethocaine and phenazone) with or with- out amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/day).46 The NHED was a combination of Calendula officinalis flowers (marigold, 28%), Hypericum perforatum complete herb (St. John’s wort, 30%), and Verbascum thapsus flowers (mullein, 25%), with the essential oils Allium sativum (garlic, 0.05%) (10%), Lavendula officinalis (lavender, 5%), and tocopherol acetate oil (vitamin E, 2%). Dosage was 5 drops three times daily. All groups had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over the course of the 3 days, with a 95.9% reduction in the NHED-alone group. The NHED plus antibiotics produced a 90.9% diminution in pain. The anesthetic alone and anesthetic with antibiotics produced 84.7% and 77.8% reductions, respectively. Considering the positive outcomes in this study and significantly lower toxicity profile than those of conventional antibiotic or anes- thetic medications, naturopathic eardrops may be the superior choice for children with ear pain–associated otalgia. As a side note, there are numerous other botanical anodynes not employed in this formula that would be worthy of study as well.

## Echinacea

Echinachea is well known to treat upper respiratory infection, and in vitro studies of Echinacea suggest a stimulatory effect of Echinacea purpurea preparations on various components of the cytokine cas- cade.48 A few evaluations in adults show improvement in cold severity and duration,49 whereas other studies do not show benefit.50 One anal- ysis suggests that Echinacea shows no benefit and is associated with a borderline increased risk of infection compared with a placebo. Despite randomization, this study did have notable disparities among treat- ment groups regarding frequency of confounding factors, including frequency of otitis media before study entry and day-care attendance. The children on Echinacea in this study’s sham manipulation group had double the incidence of upper respiratory infections in the pre- vious year compared with the placebo arm and were 50% more likely to be in day care. These confounding factors are so significant that the results should be scrutinized. As a monotherapy, Echinacea’s efficacy is unclear. Given this botanical’s long history of benefit, it is likely that it is a helpful ally in combination with other natural treatments.

## Xylitol

Xylitol is a commonly used sweetener known mostly for its anticario- genic properties. It is a sugar alcohol derived mainly from birch and other hardwood trees and has demonstrated inhibition of S. pneumoniae. Two randomized trials illustrated xylitol’s ability to reduce acute otitis media incidence by 40%. In one study of 306 day-care children with recurrent acute otitis media, 157 children were given xylitol (8.4 g/day) chewing gum, and 149 children were given a sucrose control gum.51 During the 2 months of the trial, at least one event of acute otitis media was experi- enced by 20.8% of the children who received sucrose compared with only 12.1% of those receiving the chewing gum containing xylitol. Significantly fewer antimicrobials were prescribed among those receiving xylitol. In a second randomized, controlled, blinded trial, 857 healthy children were randomized to one of five treatment groups to receive control syrup, xylitol syrup, control chewing gum, xylitol gum, or xylitol lozenges for 3 months.52 The daily dose of xylitol varied from 8.4 g (chewing gum) to 10 g (syrup). Although at least one event of otitis was experienced by 41% of the 165 children who received con- trol syrup, only 29% of the 159 children receiving xylitol syrup were affected. Likewise, compared with control subjects, the occurrence of otitis decreased by 40% in the children who received xylitol chewing gum and 20% in the lozenge group. Thus the occurrence of acute oti- tis media during the follow-up period was significantly lower in those who received xylitol syrup or gum, and these children required antimi- crobials less often than did controls. Xylitol has been criticized as a practical method because stud- ies suggest dosing needs to be four to five times per day, which may decrease compliance and therefore overall effectiveness. Although two children in the xylitol group experienced diarrhea, no other untoward effects were reported for this safe and useful treatment.

Sinupret is an herbal combination originating in Germany that con- sists of sorrel (aerial) (Rumex acetosa) 36 mg, European elder (flower) (Sambucus nigra) 36 mg, Cowslip (flower with calyx) (Primula veris) 36 mg, European vervain (aerial) (Verbena officinalis) 36 mg, and gen- tian (root; Gentiana lutea) 12 mg. One study of 64 children evaluated 32 children using amoxicillin alone and 32 using amoxicillin plus Sinupret.53 The Sinupret seemed to have more effective antibiotic properties and reduced the frequency of complications. A second integrative study of 40 children with a mean age of 4.5 years found similar results.54 This herbal combination may be a reasonable choice for children already started on antibiotic medication.


Vitamin A plays a role in the prevention of oxidative tissue damage, immune system function, and mucous membrane integrity. Although it has not been studied in children, animal studies have shown that pre- treatment with vitamin A before S. pneumoniae inoculation conferred protection by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing the formation of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide.55


Vitamin D deficiency has long been associated with a variety of health conditions and has drawn attention for its role in immune system reg- ulation, having been studied for a number of immune-related condi- tions. Several studies have found vitamin D levels to be low in patients suffering from both acute and chronic otitis media, compared with controls, suggesting a potential role for vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of otitis media.56–58 Furthermore, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 116 children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media found that treating vitamin D defi- ciency with oral administration of vitamin D at a level of 1000 IU per day reduced the risk of acute otitis media.59 The study also found that the likelihood of acute otitis media was lowest in those children who achieved serum vitamin D levels of at least 30 ng/mL.

## 1664SECTION 6 Diseases


Probiotics of various species and strains have been studied for their potential role in preventing and treating otitis media. These bacteria may have a role in immune regulation at mucosal membranes and may play a role in colony-forming activity in the upper respiratory tract. Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BB-12 has been studied in the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections and acute otitis media. One study reported that supplementation of infants with this strain of bacteria lowers the risk of upper respiratory tract infection but does not appear to lower the risk of otitis media.60,61 Upper respiratory tract infections may cause otitis media, especially when these infections become chronic, and there may be a role for this bacteria in preven- tion. However, further research is needed to confirm this. In vitro studies of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG have shown that it can inhibit adherence of S. pneumoniae to human epithelial cells and therefore may have a role to play in the prevention of otitis media.62 Further, supplementation with L. rhamnosus GG has been shown to result in colonization of adenoid tissue and the middle ear. However, those studies that demonstrated colonization also failed to display differences in symptoms or inhibition of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.63,64 A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials involving 1805 participants found that L. rhamnosus GG administra- tion was associated with reduced incidence of acute otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and antibiotic treatments.65 The variance in these studies warrants further research. Streptococcus salivarius K12 has been shown by several studies of school-age children to reduce the incidence of acute otitis media and streptococcal pharyngitis. One study of 222 children in their first year of kindergarten found that S. salivarius K12 significantly reduced epi- sodes of acute otitis media during a 6-month treatment period and a 3-month follow-up period.66 Another study of 133 school-aged chil- dren found that S. salivarius K12 reduced the incidence of pharyngo- tonsillitis by 90% and the incidence of acute otitis media by 70%.67 A study of a related strain, S. salivarius 24SMB, administered with Streptococcus oralis 89a, showed that it reduced the incidence of acute otitis media as well.68

## Humidifiers

Humidifiers are popular treatments for otitis media and upper respi- ratory tract infections in children. According to a 1994 study that eval- uated the role of low humidity in this disorder, this may be justified.69 Using a rat model, the study examined the effect of low humidity on the middle ear. Twenty-three rats were housed for 5 days in a low- humidity environment (10%–12% relative humidity), and 23 control rats were housed at 50% to 55% relative humidity. Microscopic ear examinations were graded for otitis media before testing and on test days 3 and 5. The lining of the middle ears and eustachian tubes were examined by biopsy. Significantly more effusions were observed in the low-humidity group on both days 3 and 5, but biopsy results were sim- ilar in both groups. Possible explanations are that low humidity may induce nasal swelling and reduce ventilation of the eustachian tube or that it may dry the eustachian tube lining, which could lead to an inability to clear fluid as well as to increased secretions. The mast cells residing in the lining of the eustachian tubes may also come into play by releasing histamine and producing swelling. Although preliminary, this research indicates that increasing humidity with the help of a humidifier may be an important goal in the treatment of otitis media with effusion.

## Osteopathic Manipulation

One case study reports the benefits of osteopathic manipulation to decrease the frequency of otitis media in children with recurrent disease.70 However, another randomized controlled trial using up to five osteopathic manipulative treatments over a 3-month period did not show benefit.71 The osteopathic approach acknowledges abnor- mal structural dynamics, which can contribute to change in func- tion. These dynamics may be modulated with cranial manipulative work.72,73 In young patients with structural dysfunction, this may be a beneficial treatment in conjunction with other therapies suggested in this chapter.

## Homeopathy

One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted in a private pediatric practice with 75 children aged months to 6 years.74 All children had middle ear effusion and ear pain, fever, or both for no more than 36 hours. Each child received either an individualized homeopathic medicine or a placebo three times daily by mouth for 5 days or until symptoms subsided. Results demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in symptoms using homeopathy over placebo and nonstatistically significant fewer treatment failures in the group receiving homeopathy. Similarly, a second study found excellent results regarding the homeopathic pain-reduction rate; that is, pain was reduced by almost 2½ times over placebo controls, with 39% of the patients improving after 6 hours and another 33% after 12 hours. A follow-up study using a different homeopathic agent was given if results were not seen in the first 6 hours.75 A German prospective study has also found compara- ble results in evaluating homeopathic treatment versus conventional therapies.76 More clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the optimal uses of homeopathy. In the meantime, homeopathy is proving to be an effec- tive and extremely safe option to consider in the treatment of otitis media.


The key factor in the natural approach to chronic otitis media in chil- dren appears to be the recognition and elimination of allergies, par- ticularly food allergies, as well as support for the immune system and digestive function.


Because it is usually not possible to determine the exact allergen during an acute attack, the most common allergic foods should be eliminated from the diet. These include: • Milk and other dairy products • Eggs • Wheat • Corn • Oranges • Peanuts • Chocolate Concentrated simple carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, honey, dried fruit, concentrated fruit juice) should also be eliminated because they inhibit the immune system. These simple dietary recommendations bring relief to most children in a matter of days.


• Children’s multivitamin and mineral formula • Vitamin A: 50,000 IU/day for up to 2 days in children below 6 years of age and 4 days in children above age • Beta-carotene (natural mixed carotenoids): age in years × 20,000 IU/day (up to 200,000 IU/day) • Vitamin C: age in years × 50 mg every 2 hours

## 1665CHAPTER 204 Otitis Media

• Bioflavonoids: age in years × 50 mg every 2 hours • Zinc: age in years × 2.5 mg a day (up to 30 mg) • Thymus extract: the equivalent of 120 mg pure polypeptides with molecular weights less than 10,000 or roughly 500 mg of the crude polypeptide fraction a day


• Echinacea species: One half the adult dosage is appropriate for chil- dren younger than 6 years of age. The full adult dosage is appro- priate for children above age 6 (Echinacea is safe for children). The following doses can be given up to three times a day: • Dried root (or as tea): 0.5 to 1 g • Freeze-dried plant: 325 to 650 mg • Juice of aerial portion of Echinacea purpurea stabilized in 22% ethanol: 2 to 3 mL • Tincture (1:5): 2 to 4 mL • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL • Solid (dry powdered) extract (6.5:1 or 3.5% echinacoside): to 300 mg • Xylitol: approximately 8 g/day as either chewing gum chewed throughout the day or 10 g of the syrup per day in divided doses • Naturopathic eardrop formula: five drops in the affected ear three times daily • Sinupret: as adjunctive treatment when antibiotics are employed • Consider cranial manipulative work


Local application of heat is often helpful in reducing discomfort. It can take the form of a hot pack or the application of warm oil (especially mullein oil). These treatments help to reduce pressure in the middle ear and promote fluid drainage.

## 1667CHAPTER 205 Parkinson’s Disease

motor cortex and thalamus. People with PD often experience limb tremor, muscle rigidity, difficulty walking, and problems with balance and coordination. According to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, PD affects more than 10 million people worldwide and at least 1 mil- lion in the United States.5 About 60,000 new cases are reported annu- ally in the United States. These figures are expected to increase as the average age of the population increases. The disorder appears to be 1.5 times more common in men than in women. The prevalence and incidence of PD rise with age, with the average age at onset being approximately 60 years. Because PD is a disease of the aged, disease rates are low in people below age 40, although 4% of PD diagnoses occur before age 50. PD is found in many geographical regions of the world, and rates vary from country to country.

## Pathophysiology

As with most neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative and nitric oxide stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are the primary contributors to cell death. A decrease in glutathione concentrations, the brain’s primary antioxidant, is the earliest reported biochemical event to occur in the parkinsonian substantia nigra. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated ever since it was observed that an inhibitor of complex I of the electron transport chain can induce par- kinsonism. Recent research indicates that several PD-associated genes interface with pathways regulating mitochondrial function, morphol- ogy, and dynamics. Sporadic and familial PD may converge at the level of mitochondrial integrity.7 The primary pathology of PD is the degeneration of brain cells, or neurons, in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain. These neurons produce dopamine, a critical signaling molecule. The loss of dopamine results in a profound and multifaceted disruption of normal information flow through the basal ganglia. Dopamine loss leads to an increased inhibitory influence on D2 receptors, which influences gam- ma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in the subthalamic nucleus. It is estimated that more than 60% to 80% (550,000 neurons in the substantia nigra at normal levels reduced to approximately 100,000) of the substantia nigra has been lost by the time the diagnosis of PD is made.8,9 There is an early period of compensation in which the increased synthesis of dopamine (via increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity) and proliferation of D2 receptors masks clinical symptoms. Several neurodegenerative disorders have excessive protein depo- sition as a common pathophysiological mechanism; the primary differences are the location of deposition and/or the protein(s) that accumulate (Fig. 205.1). Pathologically, Lewy bodies are considered the hallmark of classic PD. Found in the substantia nigra, Lewy bodies are abnormal intracytoplasmic accumulations of α -synuclein, a normal cellular protein that has been marked for degradation by the ubiquitin complex but appears to have escaped the normal degradation process. The presence of Lewy bodies cannot be used as a diagnostic criterion because they can be seen only at autopsy. Autopsies have uncovered Lewy bodies in as many as 10% of older persons without a diagnosis of PD, and there is evidence that Lewy bodies are actually neuroprotec- tive as opposed to directly neurotoxic.10,11 Unfortunately, symptoms do not occur until the nervous system’s “reserve” has been exhausted and significant nervous system damage has already occurred.

## Substantia Nigra Cell Death

Apoptosis accounts for much of the pathology seen in PD as well as in diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyo- trophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), which are marked by the loss of brain neurons. Elevated apoptosis (at a rate of four times higher in PD compared with normal controls) in these neurological diseases seems to be related to a lack of production of nerve growth factor and to free-radical damage. A combination of such factors could likely cause many cells to destroy themselves. Manipulation of this process of apoptosis may help in treating these neurological diseases. In fact, studies in animal models imply that long-term delivery of nerve growth factors could protect against programmed cell death in these conditions.12–14 Until the mechanisms of apoptosis are elucidated, some natural therapeutics that may decrease programmed cell death, such as melatonin therapy, may be of benefit in PD (see further discus- sion of melatonin later in the chapter).

Decreased activity of substantia nigra mitochondrial complex I has been estimated in 32% to 38% of patients with nonfamilial PD.15,16 In addition, reduced mitochondrial membrane activity (with opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores [PTPs]) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production have been found in skin fibroblasts of patients with PD with certain concomitant genetic mutations.17 Patients with PD also have been shown to have elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon-gamma.18,19

## Oxidative Stress and Glutathione Deficiency

Biochemical changes, including increased levels of neurotoxic metals, the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, and depleted gluta- thione levels occurring in the substantia nigra,20 all suggest that oxida- tive stress is present and pathologically involved in patients with PD.21 Using healthy patients as a control, studies in patients dying from PD have observed 40% reduced glutathione levels in these patients, whereas oxidized glutathione was insignificantly marginally elevated.22 Depletion of glutathione levels in the brain may be an early component of the disease process because these suboptimal levels have also been found to occur in presymptomatic PD, also known as incidental Lewy body disease.23 Some researchers are finding that this glutathione deficiency may be a common denominator in all parkinsonian conditions associated with nigral damage.20 Although not completely elucidated, it is known that • Slowness, rigidity, tremor • Alpha-synuclein accumulation

glutathione exhibits several functions in the brain by acting as an anti- oxidant and a redox regulator. Glutathione depletion has been shown to affect mitochondrial function, probably via selective inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity. Oxidative damage due to glutathi- one depletion may also encourage the aggregation of defective pro- teins, leading to cell death of nigral-striatal dopaminergic neurons.21 Glutathione depletion may enhance the susceptibility of substan- tia nigra to destruction by endogenous or exogenous toxins. Restoring antioxidant levels within the brain may be a valuable therapeutic strat- egy for PD.20

## Environmental Exposures

Epidemiological studies and experimental animal models have iden- tified an association between PD and the following environmental risk factors: rural residence; farming; well-water drinking; exposure to pesticides (including organochlorines, carbamates, paraquat, maneb, rotenone, and diethyldithiocarbamate); and long-term occupational exposure to copper, iron, lead, and manganese.24 Additionally, it is possible that the pesticides and metals act synergistically with other exposures to increase the risk of PD.25–28 Another example of envi- ronmental exposure is iatrogenic parkinsonism caused by exposure to central dopamine antagonists. The literature for these associations is provided in the following subsections.

# MPTP

The first hint that PD may be related to an environmental toxin came from a report based on a series of patients who developed parkinson- ism after exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a contaminant found in synthetic heroin.29 It was found that MPTP can freely cross the blood–brain barrier, is selectively taken up by dopaminergic cells, disrupts calcium homeostasis, induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inhibits mitochondrial complex 1 function in the respiratory chain, an established factor in the PD pathophysiology.30,31 MPTP is the only environmental agent that has been directly linked to the development of levodopa-responsive par- kinsonism, a form that is clinically indistinguishable from PD.1

## “Natural” Pesticides (Rotenone)

Rats exposed to the “organic” pesticide rotenone develop parkinsonian symptoms as well as changes in the brain resembling those seen in PD in humans. Mimicking the effect of MPTP, rotenone works by inhibit- ing complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It was observed that chronic, systemic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by the lipophilic pesticide rotenone can cause highly selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration that is associated behaviorally with hypo- kinesia and rigidity. Additionally, nigral neurons in rotenone-treated rats accumulate fibrillar cytoplasmic inclusions that contain ubiquitin and α -synuclein.32 These inclusions are the major constituent of intra- cellular protein inclusions forming the Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Other studies have also shown that chronic administration of rotenone over a long period can increase nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation products in the brain cortex and striatum in rats, which then clearly mimic parkinsonian behavioral symptoms such as akinesia and rigidity.33 Interestingly, rotenone is a natural pesticide and until very recently was allowed to be used in organic produce.

## Synthetic Pesticides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D],

<!-- chunk -->

## Paraquat, Maneb, and Permethrin)

A 2009 case-controlled multicenter study analyzed the effect of occupa- tion on PD risk. Occupational pesticide exposure emerged as the most consistent etiological association with parkinsonism. In experimental settings, the three specific pesticides identified (2,4-dichlorophenoxy- acetic acid, paraquat, and permethrin) all have effects on dopaminer- gic neurons. This convergence of epidemiological and laboratory data from experimental models of PD lends credence to a causative role of certain pesticides in the neurodegenerative process.34 Maneb and paraquat, two widely used pesticides, have been asso- ciated with PD. Researchers studied pesticide exposure in California’s Central Valley and found that when people were exposed to both maneb and paraquat within 500 m of their homes, their likelihood of being diagnosed with PD was substantially increased compared with those without exposure. The majority of the risk for being diagnosed with PD was attributed to exposure between 1974 and 1989—and all those so exposed were then children, teenagers, or young adults. This group of people, who had younger-onset PD (meaning that they were diagnosed before the age of 60), were four to six times more likely to develop PD if they were exposed to both pesticides.35 Another 2009 study done in five countries in Europe also explored this association; 959 prevalent cases of parkinsonism and 1989 controls were questioned regarding lifetime occupational and hobby exposure to solvents, pesticides, iron, copper, and manganese.34 Pesticide expo- sure and increased prevalence of PD suggest a causative role. Repeated traumatic loss of consciousness was also associated with increased risk.

## Solvents

Some case-control studies and case reports have shown an associa- tion between solvent exposure and parkinsonism.36 Records from a major United Kingdom engineering company were culled to explore the relationship of metal and solvent exposure and PD. The results of this survey demonstrated a significant exposure–response relationship for solvents and almost a 400% increase in risk for employees exposed for 30 years or more. This study suggests that sustained cumulative exposure is probably significant because there was no evidence of an overall increase in risk for those exposed for shorter durations. The authors noted that possibly the more heavily affected workers experi- enced exposure before the introduction of stricter industrial environ- mental controls later in the 20th century or exposure to older solvents such as trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, kerosene, white spirit, and acetone, which were more widely used three or more decades ago and may have played a greater etiological role.37 Although the study mentioned previously showed no increased risk of PD in relation to metal exposure, occupational exposure to specific metals—especially manganese, copper, lead, iron, mercury, zinc, and aluminum—appears, based on epidemiological studies, to be a risk factor for PD.38 Elevated levels of several of these metals have also been reported in the substantia nigra of PD subjects. Like pesticides, sev- eral divalent and trivalent metal ions are also found to contribute to accelerations in the rate of α -synuclein fibril formation. In one study, aluminum contributed to fibril formation, along with the chloride salts of copper2+, iron3+, cobalt3+, and manganese2+.38 Chronic mer- cury inhalation has also been linked to cortical and cerebellar atrophy, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and ataxia of the lower limbs.39

## Manganese

Manganese toxicity is different than PD, but the two present very similarly. With toxicity, manganese-induced damage is found in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and caudate nucleus with depletion of dopamine and serotonin levels and has been linked to psychiatric changes followed by impaired motor activity with muscle rigidity and tremors.24 Welders, who are commonly exposed to substantial amounts of manganese, do not have a higher incidence of PD, but they do appear to

## 1669CHAPTER 205 Parkinson’s Disease

develop the disease approximately 11 years before most other patients with PD do. Other sources of manganese include well water and indus- trial waste. Unfortunately, it is not routine to assess manganese levels in patients presumed to have PD, and little research has been done on chronic, low-level exposure to ambient manganese (i.e., from indus- trial waste.) As imaging techniques improve and become more readily available, it will be easier to differentiate manganism from PD.

## Iron

Elemental iron has been shown to be elevated by about 50% in the substantia nigra in patients with PD compared with controls.40 Iron accumulation has been related to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, PD, type I neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and others. Increased levels of iron as well as accom- panying lipid peroxidation combined with a decreased level of gluta- thione and superoxide dismutase activity are present in the substantia nigra of patients with PD.21,41 Although it is unclear whether the accu- mulation of iron in the brain is primary or secondary to the develop- ment of neurodegenerative disorders,42 one animal study has shown that unilateral injection of FeCl 3 into the substantia nigra of adult rats resulted in a 95% decrease of striatal dopamine, which impaired dopa- mine-related behavioral responses. This supports the assumption that iron may trigger the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD.43

## Detoxification Dysfunction and Genetics

The role of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) in the disease etiology of PD has been under investigation by numerous researchers for the past several decades. The association of a number of defects in both Phase I and Phase II reactions with PD and motor neuron disease has been extensively studied. It has been demonstrated by in vivo or in vitro methods and by the functional genomics of XMEs and neuro- degenerative diseases that PD and motor neuron disease (MND) can be associated with problems in xenobiotic metabolism; moreover, it appears that 38% to 39% of patients with MND/PD have a defect in the S-oxidation of the mucoactive drug carbocysteine by an unknown cytosolic oxidase. This implies that in a significant number of patients with PD, there may be an underlying dysfunction in the body’s ability to detoxify.44 This dysfunction theoretically could lead to an increased vulnera- bility to neurotoxins after exposure to sulfur-containing substances.45 Connections with Alzheimer’s disease and other motor neuron dis- eases have also been made.46 First-degree relatives of patients with PD are 2.3 times more likely to develop the disease than first-degree relatives of controls, although genetics may play a larger role in those diagnosed before the age of 50.47,48 Certainly, genetic determination is but one factor and must be looked at in light of the strong support that has been found for the roles of nutritional and environmental factors, as discussed else- where in this chapter.49 Mutations in the gene on chromosome 4q21.3-q22 that codes for alpha-synuclein (SNCA gene) have been implicated in multiple synucleinopathies.50 Other genes to consider include Glucocerebrosidase (GBA), LRRK2, PARK2, PINK1, and DJ-1, although routine genetic testing for PD is not yet indicated.

# DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS

No diagnostic test can clearly identify PD. It is usually diagnosed by a neurologist who can evaluate symptoms and their severity. Often a proper diagnosis will depend on a thorough neurological examina- tion. As a minimum, bradykinesia with either tremor or rigidity must be present to diagnose PD.51 Patients with accurately diagnosed PD should see a beneficial response to dopaminergic therapy. Lack of response to high-dose (1000–1500 mg) levodopa daily for at least months makes PD highly unlikely. Postural instability tends to develop later in the course of the disease, and early instability likely points to another cause of parkinsonism. Brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and blood and urine tests are not necessary to diag- nose PD but can help rule out other conditions in the differential diag- nosis. The prevalence of dementia in PD is approximately 40%, and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) accounts for 3.6% of all cases of dementia. PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies may represent differ- ent clinical manifestations of the same disease.52–54


Naturopathic philosophy prioritizes the prevention of disease as the primary therapeutic strategy. This is especially difficult in PD, where the degenerative process begins about a decade before the symptoms of the disease are diagnosed. The slow, insidious nature of PD makes preven- tion and even early detection especially difficult. Conventionally, few efforts have been made to identify susceptible individuals, most likely because there are no established conventional neuroprotective agents; an individual identified as having a high likelihood of developing PD would be left to wait until symptoms appeared. Naturopathically, there are dozens of lifestyle modifications and nutraceuticals with preliminary data supporting their role in neuroprotection. With tools in hand, identifying those at risk for developing PD becomes practi- cal and pressing. Immediate family members of those with PD are at increased risk, and symptoms such as restless legs syndrome, loss of smell, and constipation often precede the onset of tremor by several years; individuals with these symptoms are encouraged to consider the therapeutic strategies described in the following discussion.

## Conventional Medicine

Unfortunately, no conventional therapy has been shown to modify the progressive pathology of degeneration in PD.55 However, PD symp- toms are somewhat treatable. For decades, the drug levodopa, com- monly known as l-dopa, has been the mainstay of PD treatment. It is synthesized by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase from the food-derived aromatic amino acid tyrosine. Modern treatment combines l-dopa with a peripheral decarboxylase enzyme inhibitor (Carbidopa) to min- imize conversion of l-dopa to dopamine outside the nervous system.41 Although initially effective in the early stages of the disease, l-dopa provides only symptomatic relief, without altering disease progression, and it loses efficacy with time.2 The side effects of l-dopa can include motor complications, particularly fluctuations and dyskinesias, as well as nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sedation, hallucinations, and delusions; moreover, l-dopa contributes to decreased slow-wave peristaltic activity,56 which may contribute to inadequate digestive function. It may also contribute to subtle detrimental effects on cog- nitive function57 and may have a wide array of other psychiatric man- ifestations, such as propensity to gamble.58 Responses to the drug may become more erratic over time. For these reasons, newer drugs are now also used either alone or in combination with l-dopa. Proper concom- itant naturopathic care can drastically reduce the side effects of l-dopa. It is important to emphasize that in spite of the side effects, this drug is excellent for controlling symptoms and must be considered as part of the overall treatment plan. After being virtually abandoned for 20 years, another allopathic treatment that is gaining more prominence is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS involves implanting a brain stimulator, a device similar to a heart pacemaker, in a certain area of the brain. The desired effect is to decrease the overactivity of the excitatory glutamatergic subthalamus– internal pallidum pathway caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons

## 1670SECTION 6 Diseases

within the substantia nigra. How DBS works is not well known, but it has been hypothesized that the stimulatory effect may modulate the neuronal activity and thus avoid disease-related abnormal neuronal discharges. Potential candidates for DBS are selected according to strict criteria. For some people, DBS may control symptoms so well that medications can be greatly reduced.59


Healthy dietary habits might be useful to treat and prevent PD. One large case-control study60,61 revealed that patients with PD tended to consume fewer raw vegetables, less alcohol and coffee, and more meat than control subjects. Patients with PD also reported higher carbohy- drate consumption and equivalent intakes of protein and fat. Other researchers have shown increased consumption of animal-source fat in patients with PD.62–64 Although researchers need to learn more about how food choices relate to PD, a higher intake of vegetables and a low intake of fat seem to be reasonable choices in helping prevent and possibly treat neurodegeneration. In a review of dietary factors that affect PD progression, foods associated with more rapid PD pro- gression include canned fruits and vegetables, diet and nondiet soda, fried foods, beef, ice cream, yogurt, and cheese. Foods associated with a reduced rate of progression resemble the classic Mediterranean diet and include fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, nuts and seeds, nonfried fish, olive oil, wine, coconut oil, fresh herbs, and spices.65 Coffee and caffeine intake have been shown to lower the risk of PD in several meta-analyses.66–68 The ketogenic diet may have some theoretical util- ity but requires further study.

## Food Sources of


<!-- chunk -->

## -Dopa

Interestingly, certain foods are a good source of natural l-dopa. Anecdotal reports have demonstrated that patients with PD show improved symptom control when they are consuming meals of broad beans. In some cases, the response to Vicia faba (fava beans) may be even greater than to conventional l-dopa medication. Fava beans are a good source of l-dopa: a 100-g serving of V. faba pods contains about 250 mg of l-dopa, equivalent to the l-dopa content of one of the standard pharmaceutical formulations.41 Until more is known about how to use fava beans as an l-dopa source, unsuper- vised replacement or coadministration of l-dopa with fava beans is not recommended.

## Calorie Restriction

Overeating is a major modifiable risk factor for several age-related dis- eases, including PD. Calorie restriction (CR) is usually defined as 10% to 25% less caloric intake than the average Western diet. Throughout history, the majority of the world’s population has struggled to obtain food. The ability to overeat is a relatively new phenomenon, and accordingly, the amount of food one should eat has only recently become a subject of study. In a primate model of PD, a CR diet (30% reduced) decreased the progression of PD. Animals that had been fed the reduced-intake diet had more dopamine in their brains and more glial-cell-line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a small protein that promotes the survival of neurons. GDNF’s most prominent fea- ture is its ability to support the survival of dopaminergic and motoneu- rons. The results suggest that CR extends the life span and increases the resistance of the brain to insults that involve metabolic compromise and excitotoxicity.69 As opposed to the attempts at augmenting anti- oxidant levels using exogenously supplied antioxidants, which have been largely unsuccessful, one of the proposed mechanisms of CR is enhanced production of antioxidants via intrinsic pathways.70 Given what is known about PD and CR, this theory is highly plausible and warrants further investigation.

## Low-Protein Diet

For those patients taking l-dopa, a low-protein diet may be useful. One double-blind study compared a low-protein intake of 50 g/day for men and 40 g/day for women with a high-protein intake of 80 g/day for men and 70 g/day for women. By the end of the trial, total performance scores were significantly improved in the treatment group given lower protein intakes. Additionally, tremor, hand agility, and mobility in the low-protein groups also improved.71 Absorption of l-dopa is delayed or diminished by amino acids in protein meals.57 It has been shown that the modification of meal patterns so that most of the protein intake occurs in the evening also improved symptoms.71 It is therefore recommended that patients on l-dopa take their medication with a high-carbohydrate meal and delay protein intake until the final meal of the day so as to optimize the ther- apeutic efficacy of the medication.41


Given the abundance of data suggesting that an excessive free-radical burden contributes to PD, it is logical to consider antioxidant augmenta- tion as a therapeutic target. Unfortunately, the PD–antioxidant research has been disappointing. One large, well-designed study attempted to use high-dose vitamin E as a treatment, with no apparent improvement in symptoms or disease progression.72 A prospective study evaluated 76,890 women for 14 years and 47,331 men for 12 years. All the participants were health care professionals, mostly doctors and nurses. Every 2 to years, they filled out detailed surveys about their diets, including their vitamin intake from both foods and pills. A total of 371 people developed PD during the study. The investigators found that neither vitamin C nor carotenoid intake lowered the risk. The results were the same for the use of vitamin E supplements. This study seems to support the idea that vita- min E supplementation does not help protect against PD. However, those participants who ate vitamin E–rich foods as parts of their diets curi- ously developed the fewest cases of PD.73 Co-supplementation of mg omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed oil, and 400 IU vitamin E for 12 weeks has led to improved metabolic status in patients with PD. Patients had reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and increases in glutathione concentrations as well as total antioxidant capacity.74

## Glutathione

Given the importance of glutathione as a powerful brain tissue antiox- idant, effective repletion should be a therapeutic priority. Combined intravenous and oral liposomal glutathione replacement is safe, is well tolerated, and may offer a therapeutic benefit.71 Intranasal glu- tathione has been shown to be safe up to 600 mg per day but has not been shown to be superior to placebo after a 3-month intervention.75 N-acetylcysteine and α -lipoic acid are glutathione precursors that may also be of use. As a systemic antioxidant, glutathione’s ongoing reple- tion may help ameliorate PD-related damage to the heart, liver, mus- cles, and other organs as well. It is also recommended to take other antioxidants for synergistic support. Especially noteworthy is high- dose vitamin C, which provides antioxidant-reducing equivalents known to conserve glutathione.71


Vitamin D, a fat-soluble prohormone, has been linked to maintain- ing physiological function as well as preventing diseases such as bone, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological disorders. Endogenous synthesis occurs in the skin with exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation, primarily from sunlight. Diet, such as fortified foods and certain fish, can also provide minor amounts of vitamin D. Deficiency can result from inadequate sun exposure, metabolic or absorption disorders, and other genetically influenced factors.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1671CHAPTER 205 Parkinson’s Disease

Patients with chronic neurodegenerative disease are at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency due to advanced age, obesity, and decreased sun exposure. One study demonstrated that patients with PD were more likely to exhibit vitamin D insufficiency than those with Alzheimer’s disease, a related neurodegenerative disorder. Vitamin D regulates multiple cellular processes known to be abnormal in PD, including cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The researchers of this study suggest that patients with PD should be checked more regularly for low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as a strategy for minimizing further complications of the disease.76 Polymorphisms in the Vitamin D Receptor Fokl gene are associated with an increased risk of PD.77 There is currently no consensus on vitamin D deficiency and substantially increased risk of PD.

## Coenzyme Q

<!-- chunk -->

## 10

Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ) is also known as ubiquinone; its primary bio- chemical action is as a cofactor in the electron transport chain, the series of redox reactions involved in the synthesis of ATP. CoQ 10 is best known for its role in treating cardiovascular disease (CVD), and CVD is a well-established comorbidity in PD. Preliminary data suggest that CoQ 10 is one of the most promising neuroprotective agents for PD, although a recent meta-analysis failed to show the superiority of CoQ10 supplementation over a placebo.78 Nonetheless, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clin- ical pilot study suggested that high-dose CoQ 10 may also help slow symptom progression in early PD. In this study, 80 unmedicated patients with early-stage disease were randomly given CoQ 10 at dosages of 300, 600, or 1200 mg/day or a placebo. Using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), they were followed up for 16 months or until disability requiring treatment with l-dopa had developed. It was found that patients on CoQ 10 fared significantly better than their placebo counterparts, with those taking 1200 mg showing the greatest results.79 A second placebo-controlled, double-blind experiment used 360 mg of CoQ 10 for 4 weeks in 28 treated and stable patients with PD. CoQ 10 supplementation provided a significant although mild symp- tomatic benefit in PD symptoms and significantly better improvement in visual defects compared with placebo.80 High doses of CoQ 10 have proven to be safe in the short term. In a 2-week open-label trial, 17 patients with PD received an increasing dosage of CoQ 10 (1200, 1800, 2400, and 3000 mg/day, respectively) with an unvarying dosage of 1200 IU/day of the α -tocopherol form of vitamin E. The plasma level of CoQ 10 was measured at each dos- age. Thirteen of the subjects were increased to the 3000-mg dose, with no CoQ 10 -related side effects. One patient became orthostatic, and one was dyspeptic, but these conditions were unrelated to the CoQ 10 . Looking at the blood, plasma levels of ubiquinone reached a plateau at the 2400-mg/day dosage. This study was not long enough to assess any clinical effect on the disease itself,81 but a follow-up study is under way.

## Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone manufactured from serotonin and is secreted by the pineal gland. Known as a powerful antioxidant, melatonin is an established treatment option for jet lag and various sleep disorders. Although studies show that melatonin does not induce any increase in cerebrovascular blood flow,82 evidence supports the role of melatonin as a protector of neuronal cells, most likely by supporting mitochon- drial function and preventing apoptosis. As an antioxidant, melatonin can directly scavenge oxidants pro- duced during normal metabolism, and it indirectly promotes the activ- ity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Second, melatonin increases the activity and the expression of elec- tron transport chain complexes during physiological and pathological situations. As a result, melatonin increases ATP production and pro- motes glutathione homeostasis. It has also been postulated that mel- atonin may interact with the mitochondrial genome to enhance the production of proteins.83 Tissue culture models of PD using low doses of 6-hydroxydopamine to induce apoptosis of undifferentiated and neuronal rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells have also shown mela- tonin to prevent apoptosis in these models.84 It is theoretically possible that melatonin exacerbates the symptoms of PD because of its putative interference with dopamine release.85 But the larger body of literature agrees that PD is probably due to mul- tiple issues of compromised mitochondrial activity in the substantia nigra,86 loss of glutathione,87 oxidative damage, and increased apop- totic events. Reasonably, melatonin supplementation may yield a direct benefit. Clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the effective- ness of melatonin in PD.

## Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide

Found useful in treating animal models of PD,88 the coenzyme nico- tinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is known to enhance endog- enous dopamine production by supplying reducing equivalents to the rate-limiting, tyrosine hydroxylase–catalyzed step of dopamine syn- thesis in both tissue culture and human evaluations.89 A positive effect has been found using NADH both intravenously and intramuscularly in 34 patients with PD in an open-label trial. In this trial, each patient experienced a beneficial clinical effect: 21 showed a “very good” (better than 30%) improvement of disability, and 13 patients showed a “mod- erate” (up to 30%) improvement. The effect of NADH was dependent on both the dose given and the severity of disease. The optimal thera- peutic range for NADH was 25 to 50 mg per day. Intravenous admin- istration seemed to work better than intramuscular injection. The presence of homovanillic acid in the urine was significantly increased in all patients. The presence of this metabolite indicates stimulation of endogenous l-dopa biosynthesis.90 A second study of 15 patients pro- spectively investigated the administration of one 10-mg treatment over 30 minutes a day for 7 days. These patients were also taking l-dopa medications. The patients’ UPDRS scores improved, and significant increases in plasma l-dopa were observed.91 Nevertheless, because of the lack of sufficient studies and theoretical considerations for under- lying NADH disposal, many in the medical community do not cur- rently recommend the widespread use of NADH for PD.89 As with many newer therapies, more rigorous studies are necessary to confirm the benefit and elucidate any side-effect risk.

## B Vitamins

Higher dietary intake of vitamin B 6 has been shown to have a protec- tive effect in the development of PD. Patients diagnosed with PD also have lower vitamin B 12 levels than controls.92 Dietary intake of folate has not been observed to be consequential in the development of PD, although hyperhomocysteinemia occurs in 10% to 30% of patients with PD.93

## Creatine

Creatine is an important player in brain homeostasis and acts as a temporal and spatial buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of the cellular energy currency, ATP, and its precursor adenosine diphos- phate (ADP).94 Well known mostly as a body-building supplement, oral creatine monohydrate has also been shown to enhance memory and is being studied for the treatment of neurological, neuromuscular, and atherosclerotic disease.88 Adhihetty et al.95 have written an excellent review article on the neuroprotective potential of creatine to combat cellular energy impair- ment in neurodegenerative disease.

## Camellia sinensis (Green Tea)

Epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate that the consump- tion of green and black tea offers protection against the development of PD. As a good source of polyphenols, green tea may play a role in preventing and treating the oxidative stress prevalent in several neu- rodegenerative disorders. The biological properties of green tea poly- phenols reported in the literature include significant penetration of the blood–brain barrier, antioxidant actions, free-radical scaveng- ing, iron-chelating properties, inhibition of (3)H-dopamine and (3) H-methyl-4-phenylpyridine uptake, reduction of catechol-O-methyl- transferase activity, activation of protein kinase C or the extracellu- lar signal-regulated kinase signal pathway, and modulation of the cell survival/cell cycle gene.96,97 Green tea polyphenols have demonstrated neuroprotective activity in cell cultures and animal models, including the prevention of neurotoxin-induced cell injury.96,98 Green tea poly- phenols, such as (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, are now being consid- ered as therapeutic agents aimed at altering brain-aging processes and serving as possible neuroprotective agents.99,100

## Ginkgo biloba

Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) exerts profound, widespread tissue effects, including membrane-stabilizing, antioxidant, and free-radical–scav- enging effects. GBE also enhances the utilization of oxygen and glu- cose. GBE is an extremely effective inhibitor of lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes. Although there are no clinical studies in patients with PD, GBE is well researched for its beneficial effects in Alzheimer’s disease101,102 and has been shown useful in animal models of PD.101,103 GBE exhibits a protective effect on the PD models both in vivo and in vitro. Antioxidation and antiapoptosis are proposed to be involved in the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of GBE.103

## Mucuna puriens (Velvet Bean)

The seed powder of the velvet bean has long been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for diseases, including PD. It is a rich natural source of l-dopa, but other components also contribute to its medic- inal actions. An extract of velvet bean was studied in 60 patients with PD (before treatment, 26 patients were given Sinemet with the extract, and the remaining 34 were not given any medication).104 Statistically significant reductions in symptom scores were seen from the begin- ning to the end of the 12-week study. The amount used in the study was 7.5 g of the extract dissolved in water 3 to 6 times daily. In another study, eight patients with PD were challenged with single doses of 200-/50-mg L-dopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) and 15 and 30 g of velvet bean preparation in a randomized order at weekly intervals.105 Compared with standard LD/CD, the 30-g velvet bean preparation led to a con- siderably faster onset of effect (34.6 vs. 68.5 minutes), reflected in shorter times to peak L-dopa concentrations in the blood, and fewer side effects. The researchers felt that the velvet bean might possess advantages over conventional l-dopa preparations. This conclusion has been confirmed in various animal models.106,107 In a small pilot trial comparing velvet bean to LD/CD administration, velvet bean had lower tolerability (gastrointestinal symptoms or worsening motor per- formance) but performed as well as LD/CD in those who were able to tolerate it.108 Individuals taking medications like Sinemet and l-dopa should be aware that velvet bean consumption may lead to too-high l-dopa levels.

Although no side effects have been reported using standardized kava extracts at recommended levels in clinical studies, there have been iso- lated reports of kava causing an onset of parkinsonian symptoms.109 Additionally, several case reports have indicated that kava may inter- fere with dopamine and worsen PD.110,111 Until this issue is resolved, kava extract should not be used in patients with PD or those consid- ered genetically susceptible.

## Other Therapeutic Considerations

<!-- chunk -->

## Smoking

A number of epidemiological studies demonstrate that smoking is associated with a lower incidence112 and delayed onset113 of PD. Although it is unclear which mechanisms account for this effect, it is postulated that nicotine may enhance the striatal stimulation of dopa- minergic neurons, which are selectively damaged in PD. Because the risk:benefit ratio of smoking is high, it is not advised that smoking be suggested as a reasonable preventive measure.

## Estrogen

Increasing evidence suggests that estrogens may modulate the activ- ity of dopamine,114,115 may act as an antiapoptotic agent,116 and could affect the neuronal pathways affected in PD.117 Animal studies have demonstrated that estrogens influence the synthesis, release, and metabolism of dopamine and may actually modulate the expression and function of dopamine receptors. Some clinical studies have also suggested that parkinsonian symptoms may worsen after meno- pause and that hormone replacement therapy can be protective,118,119 whereas others hypothesize that decreases in circulating estrogen may improve PD.114 The conflicting findings suggest that several variables, including age, estrogen dose and formulation, and timing and length of dosing period, may determine whether benefits are seen and what their nature might be.117 At this time, it may be best for clinicians to pay close atten- tion to correlations between menstrual patterns and symptomatic dis- ease to make the best patient-specific choices with regard to hormone replacement.


Moderate to vigorous physical activity and exercise is associated with a reduced risk for developing PD.120–122 As part of interdisciplinary treatment, and when approved by a physician, yoga may offer ther- apeutic benefit.123 Low-intensity progressive cycling exercise deliv- ered over 16 sessions spanning 2 months improved motor function in PD, particularly akinesia.124 Larger, well-designed clinical trials are necessary before targeted physiotherapeutic recommendations can be made for patients with PD. Until that time, physical activity should be encouraged within the confines of approved and tolerable motor activities.

## Homeopathy

No clinical studies are available to support the use of homeopathy in PD, although anecdotal success stories are known. Some of the reme- dies and the symptoms they are said to relieve include the following: • Agaricus muscarius: crawling sensations, vertigo with impulse to fall backward, symptoms worse in cold weather • Antimonium crudum: parkinsonian movements associated with gastric symptoms; desire for sour foods that do not sit well in the digestive tract; a thickly white-coated tongue; stubbornness; anx- iousness; a general feeling of disgust with worse symptomatology caused by heat, wine, or moonlight • Argentum nitricum: tremulousness

## Acupuncture and Tui Na

In traditional Chinese medicine, pathogenic wind is considered the main agent responsible for the symptoms of PD. The treatment strategy is thus

to calm this wind and tranquilize the mind. In more conventional terms, it is hypothesized that acupuncture may increase levels of dopamine in the brain and augment the excitability of the dopamine neurons.125 Animal studies have shown neuroprotective effects of acupuncture on the nigrostriatal system.126,127 Acupuncture and tui na, which is a Chinese therapeutic massage, have both improved clinical disease symptoms and signs and possibly delayed disease progression.128,129 In one study, patients with PD were treated twice a week with acupuncture. Standard scales, including the UPDRS and Hoehn and Yahr staging, were used. In addition, quantitative motor tests, including timed evaluations of arm pronation supination movements, finger dexterity, finger movements between two fixed measured points, and the stand-walk-sit test, as well as a patient questionnaire designed for the study were employed. Objective improvements were noted in the sleep and rest categories, with no other obvious improvements. However, on the patient questionnaire, 85% of patients reported subjective improvement of individual symptoms, including tremor, walking, handwriting, slowness, pain, sleep, depres- sion, and anxiety.130 Another study of 26 patients found improvements in auditory-evoked brainstem potential examinations.118 A 2017 sys- temic review and meta-analysis concluded that treatment with combined acupuncture (including electroacupuncture) and conventional medica- tion (CM) showed significant improvements in the total UPDRS and Webster scales compared with those treated using CM alone.131 Acupuncture treatments are considered safe and well tolerated130 and should be considered as a safe means to improve sleep and patient perception of parkinsonian symptoms. More studies are necessary to confirm objective improvements in clinical presentations.

## Diagnosis

Besides standard neurological rating scales and imaging, serum iron, ferritin, and total iron binding may be useful to look for iron overload. Blood levels of homocysteine may also uncover hyperhomocystein- emia, a potential facilitator of disease progression. A careful history and testing should evaluate for heavy metal and pesticide exposures.

## Dietary Recommendations

• The diet should be low in animal fats and high in fiber, specifically legumes and vegetables. • Antioxidant-rich foods are recommended, including nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables (bok choy, chard, etc.), beans, spices (turmeric, clove, cinnamon), coffee, and chocolate. • Pesticides should be avoided by eating organic when possible. • To maintain bowel health and facilitate the detoxification processes of the liver, high-sulfur-containing foods like garlic, onions, and eggs, as well as water-soluble fibers such as guar gum, oat bran, pec- tin, and psyllium seed, are recommended. • For patients taking levodopa, lower protein intake is recommended (50 g/day for men and 40 g/day for women). In an effort to optimize the medication’s therapeutic efficacy, such patients should take their medications 30 to 45 minutes before protein-containing meals. • Because of constant movement, weight loss may be an issue with some patients; therefore caloric intake may need to be adjusted to specific patient needs.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lifestyle Recommendations

Patients with PD should be advised to do the following: • Avoid cooking in aluminum pots. • Exercise regularly—tandem and recumbent bikes are especially well suited for individuals with PD. • Hold on to banisters and sit in chairs with higher arms.

<!-- chunk -->

## Nutritional Supplementation

• Iron and manganese supplements should be avoided. • High-potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula (without iron) • Vitamin D 3 : 2000 to 4000 IU a day (ideally, measure blood levels and adjust dose accordingly) • Fish oils: 1000 to 3000 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosa- hexaenoic acid (DHA) a day • Exogenous glutathione should be administered; however, the best delivery system has yet to be elucidated. Intranasal glutathione has been anecdotally reported to be effective. N-acetyl cysteine (500 mg twice a day) and ketogenic diets have been shown to boost brain glutathione levels. • Vitamins B 6 and B 12 , as well as folic acid, should be provided in doses sufficient to maintain homocysteine levels below 10. If homocysteine levels do not drop adequately, betaine may be added to the regimen. • NADH (trade name: Enada): 10 to 20 mg a day • CoQ10: Estimated daily dose to achieve target levels in PD based upon available forms (for best results, take in divided dosages): • Ubiquinone powder in hard gelatin capsule: 1200 to 2400 mg in divided doses • Ubiquinone suspended in oil in soft gelatin capsule w/rice bran oil: 600 to 1200 mg in divided doses • Ubiquinone solubilized (e.g., Q-gel) in soft gelatin capsule: to 400 mg in divided doses • Ubiquinone nanonized in soft or hard gelatin capsule: 250 to 400 mg in divided doses • Ubiquinone emulsified with soy peptide (BioQ10 SA) in soft or hard gelatin capsule: 200 to 400 mg in divided doses • Ubiquinol in soft gel capsule: 200 to 400 mg in divided doses


• Green tea: Three cups a day may be taken, or about 3 g of soluble components providing roughly 240 to 320 mg of polyphenols. For a green tea extract standardized for 80% total polyphenol and 55% epigallocatechin gallate content, this would mean a daily dose of 300 to 400 mg. • Mucuna puriens: Dose equivalent to 30 g dried powdered seed


Treatments involving needling and tui na massage according to tradi- tional Chinese medicine are recommended.

# CONCLUSION

Naturopathic medicine holds tremendous potential for the prevention and treatment of PD. Unlike conventional therapies that treat only symptoms and have notable side-effect profiles, naturopathic strat- egies attempt to optimize function as well as to reduce free-radical production and exposure to neurotoxins. It is ideal for patients that the conventional and naturopathic strategies are not at odds with one another; rather, they complement each other well. Randomized controlled trials are ill-suited study designs for diet and lifestyle interventions and even less optimal for diseases like PD, where the disease is not diagnosed until late in the course. In the meantime, dozens of epidemiological studies suggest that the diet and lifestyle choices we make over the course of our lives offer some pro- tection against the development of this disease. It is logical and prudent to incorporate foods, activities, and supplements that may have neu- roprotective potential; this is especially true for those who are at high

risk of developing PD, have symptoms associated with PD, or have been recently diagnosed. Whereas neuronal regeneration is considered virtually impossible, neuroprotective strategies are likely to be eluci- dated in the near future. As with all therapies, individuals are advised to explore the risks and benefits with their providers and initiate the strategies that are most appropriate for each situation.

## 1676SECTION 6 Diseases

both infections is probably higher because not all states require report- ing, and both infections may go undiagnosed and unreported. A higher proportion of PID has been ascribed to CT than to GC.10 Testing methods for GC and CT include cell culture, direct fluo- rescent antibody (DFA) testing, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) antigen- detection technique, nucleic acid hybridization tests (DNA probes), nucleic acid amplification (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or ligase chain reaction [LCR]), and the ThinPrep Pap Collection system. The CDC recommendations are that all sexually active adolescents undergo routine screening for CT during annual pelvic examinations. The CDC also recommends that routine screening of asymptomatic women between 20 and 24 years of age should be considered, particularly if they have a new male sex partner, more than one male sex partner, or do not use barrier contraception.

<!-- chunk -->

## Neisseria Gonorrhea

The incidence of GC in the United States increased by a factor of 2.7 from 1960 to 1980.11 Although it reached a historic low in 2009, by 2016/2017 its incidence had increased by more than 75%. The infec- tion has reached pandemic proportions in the United States, where it is estimated that for each reported case, four cases go unreported.12 Gonococci have been recovered from the urethra of 2.2% of sexually active servicemen who had minimal or no symptoms and from 40% of asymptomatic males who had contact with symptomatic women.13 In addition, an estimated 80% of the men and women exposed to Gonococcus will develop infections.14 For a seemingly delicate and fastidious species, Neisseria has impressive infective abilities, preferring human columnar and transitional epithelia. In less than 1 hour after intercourse, Gonococcus can establish itself on the urethral mucosa, where it successfully resists the flow of urine.15 Favored sites in the lower female genital tract are Bartholin’s and Skene’s glands, the urethra, and the endocervical canal.12 Direct spreading can occur from the endocervix across the endometrial surface to the tubal mucosa, or migration can occur through subendothelial vascular and lymphatic channels.4 Perhaps the most common method of spreading, however, is by vector: GC attached to spermatozoa are physically carried to the fallopian tubes.12 Primary pathogens can also enter the upper tract from retrograde menstruation or uterine contractions during intercourse.16 In the acute state, the gonococci and polymorphonuclear lympho- cytes accumulate in the subepithelial connective tissue, resulting in patchy destruction of the overlying mucosa.15,17 The consequent thin- ning of the mucosal lining is thought to facilitate the penetration of GC into deeper tissue.15 It is probably for this reason that gonococci are reported to survive only a short time in the fallopian tubes.18 However, they may be not only surviving but thriving. The descent of the microbe beyond the surfaces being examined makes detection difficult.18 It has also recently been speculated that its ability to persist, despite stimulat- ing a robust inflammatory response involving the recruitment and acti- vation of neutrophils, is precisely how it damages the host epithelium. It is the sustained inflammation and neutrophil influx responsible for tissue damage, which continues due to GCs surprising resistance.19 Concomitant infections are known to occur with GC.20 Some researchers have even proposed that GC’s primary role appears to be paving the way for secondary invaders from normal vaginal flora, allowing access to the upper tract.21 The associated infection will fre- quently be CT, but a superinfection can also be present, in which case one will find that anaerobic bacteria have colonized as well.20

## Chlamydia Trachomatis

In the United States it was once estimated that 20% to 30% of PID cases were caused by CT, and although this rate may have declined in recent years, it is still the leading cause of PID.6,22 Further, one study found that acute chlamydial PID may be subclinical or silent in 66% to 75% of the cases.23 Laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infection is difficult, which, combined with CT’s propensity to be asymptomatic, renders a thorough assessment of the scope of these infections nearly impossible. Much like GC, CT eludes both innate and adaptive immune responses. When under assault by the immune system, the intracellular form of CT (known as the reticulate body) enters a persistent nonreplicative state and may return to its infectious extracellular form (the elemen- tary body) when conditions improve.24 A 5-year study conducted in urban Sweden showed that despite a decrease in the incidence of gonococcal PID, the total number of cases of acute PID was unchanged or even increased in the last year of the study.25 Another European study, conducted in 1977, found that 62% of women with acute salpingitis had elevated (titer ≥ 1:64) chlamydial immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.26 However, most other studies completed to date show much lower percentages. These numbers will no doubt change as diagnostic technology improves and the clinical presentation of CT is more widely understood. Currently, the CDC recommends the use of nucleic acid amplification tests for both screen- ing and diagnosis. They are estimated to have a sensitivity greater than 90% and a specificity greater than 90%.27

## Anaerobic Infections

Anaerobes are the organisms most commonly isolated from the fal- lopian tubes or cul-de-sacs of patients with PID.28 Anaerobic bacteria are probably not the chief causative agents, but rather opportunists, establishing themselves in unsuccessfully defended tissues. Anaerobic infections are commonly found in immunocompro- mised hosts and are generally of endogenous origin.29 The cervix and vagina of a normal, healthy woman contain both anaerobic and aero- bic bacteria.30 Anaerobic infections establish themselves more often in older patients and in women with a history of prior PID.11

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Organisms

Facultative aerobic organisms found in tuboperitoneal fluids from women with salpingitis have included coliforms, H. influenzae, Streptococcus species, and Mycoplasma genitalium, and M. hominis.31 M. hominis has not been demonstrated as a sole etiological agent, but rather seems to be a common contributor to the polymicrobial milieu that is often discovered in PID. One study found M. homi- nis in cervical cultures from 81% of women patients with GC and 64% of those without GC.32 Similarly, M. genitalium has not con- clusively proven to be causative, but a recent meta-analysis found over a twofold risk for PID associated with infection by this sexually transmitted organism, suggesting it may play a more significant role than previously believed.33

## 1677CHAPTER 206 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

women suffers from one or more sequelae such as abdominal pain, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy.11 Dyspareunia is a symptom that is often not investigated but, when relevant questions are asked, is fre- quently found in the post-PID sufferer. Death from salpingitis is rare and is generally due to rupture of the tubo-ovarian abscess with subsequent peritonitis. A mortality rate of 5.2% to 5.9% has been calculated for tubo-ovarian abscesses; before 1950, mor- tality was 80% to 100%.34,35 Better diagnostic understanding of this com- plication, treatment with antibiotics, and prompt surgical intervention have phenomenally improved both morbidity and mortality statistics. Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome is a rare perihepatitis complicating the primary condition of PID. Characteristic violin-string adhesions attach the liver to the abdominal wall.29,36 These adhesions are due to local peritonitis involving the anterior liver surface and the adjacent abdominal wall.37 Historically, GC was thought to be the main con- tributor to this syndrome, but CT is now found more frequently.29,30 Infertility is a serious concern. Once a woman has had PID, she is at risk for additional attacks. This is in part because after the fallopian tubes have been damaged by the infectious process, normal defense mechanisms are impaired. Reinfection has been found to be the most important cause of infertility after PID.38 One study comparing the rate of nonsurgical infertility in 1973 with that of 1976 noted a 45% increase. This translates to 122,000 infertile couples per year.39 This increased incidence is consistent with the concurrent epidemic of sex- ually transmitted disease (STD)–associated PID. An alarming statistical analysis has shown that for every 1000 girls born in 1950, a total of 138 had one or more bouts of PID by age 30, were infertile because of the PID, and 9 had surgery for ectopic preg- nancy.11 It was once postulated that one of every two women reaching reproductive age would have an episode of salpingitis.30 While the inci- dence has declined over the last two decades, a recent study conducted in England found that over 16% of women between the ages of 35 to 44 had at least one previous episode of salpingitis, suggesting that this remains quite a common pathology.40 Ectopic pregnancy is a severe sequelae, and any woman with a history of PID faces a twofold to tenfold increased risk.11,41 Before a standardized approach and treatment with effective antibiotics were implemented, nearly 10% of women with salpingitis had a subsequent ectopic pregnancy, and in the 1970s ectopic pregnancies were the lead- ing cause of maternal death in nonwhite women.39 Even with modern treatments, 18% of women treated for PID reported infertility after 3 years of follow-up, and 0.6% of them had an ectopic pregnancy. Increased episodes as well as a delay in appropriate treatment have both been associated with poorer outcomes.42

## Risk Factors

In addition to the obvious factor of sexual contact, the main risk fac- tors are age, use or history of use of an intrauterine device (IUD), and previous history of PID. An earlier “sexual debut” puts a young woman in a high-risk group for PID, especially when there are multiple sex partners. The risk in sexually active 15-year-olds is 1 in 8, whereas in the average 24-year-old, it is 1 in 80.11 One interesting hypothesis for these data is that the cervical mucus in the younger woman may be estrogen-dominated, creating an environment that is more accessible to pathogens.31 Women with multiple partners have a 4.6-fold greater risk than women in monogamous relationships.30 A woman may face an increased risk of PID if she uses an IUD, although this may be insignificant with current IUDs. Oral contra- ceptive (OC) users are somewhat less likely to have GC; on the other hand, they are at increased risk for chlamydial invasion. Birth control remains a potent issue, with barrier methods being the techniques of choice because of their decreased PID risk. It should also be noted that one author included his own clinical observation that women in his practice who had vasectomized men as partners only seldom devel- oped PID.43 The last risk factor to be considered is iatrogenic. This occurs when invasive procedures have introduced pathogens or disturbed the tract flora in some other way and induced PID. Among these procedures are the following: • Cervical dilation • Abortion • Curettage • Tubal insufflation • Hysterosalpingography • Insertion of an IUD A hospital in Lund, Sweden, reported that 15% of its PID cases were iatrogenic. This indicates that PID may not be strictly an STD.29

## Pathogen Access to the Upper Female Tract

The route by which the pathogens gain access to the upper female tract has only recently been explored. Menstruation, sperm, and tricho- monads have all been shown to be important in the transportation of pathogens into the salpinx. Often the onset of menses corresponds with the onset of an epi- sode of PID. Infections occurring around the menses tend to be GC rather than CT, a clinical curiosity that may ultimately shed light on the etiology. One hypothesis is that menstrual regurgitation assists the inflammatory response by carrying sloughed endometrial epi- thelium, which may have attached GC or intracellular CT. These organisms can then proliferate in the tubal epithelium or on perito- neal surfaces.16,44 Human sperm has proved to be an interesting and multifaceted variable in the precipitation of PID. Some of the research targets bacteriospermia as a cause of infertility in men, findings that are clearly relevant to PID. Increasingly, STD research is noting the incidence of asymptomatic male carriers.12,13,43,45–48 A large pop- ulation study discovered that 66% to 75% of the men who tested positive for GC were asymptomatic.13 It is also important to note that although a Gram stain of urethral secretions has fairly high sensitivity and specificity for GC diagnosis among symptomatic men, a negative Gram stain is not sufficient to rule out infection among asymptomatic men.49 Designed to travel during intercourse, sperm also serve as effective vectors. Researchers took a look at this most basic interaction between a man and a woman by means of a laboratory experiment. They intro- duced organisms into capillary tubes containing cervical mucus, either alone or with added spermatozoa, and observed microbial motility. Cervical mucus had already been considered an effective mechanical and immunological barrier between the abundant flora of the vagina and the upper tract, and the test results confirmed this idea. However, they also demonstrated that organisms attached to sperm could eas- ily traverse the length of the mucus column. This may be particularly important during menses, because sperm migration has been observed through menstrual plasma but not during the luteal phase or through the cervical mucus of pregnancy. Electron microscopy has produced amazing photographic evidence of organisms attached to sperm.15,50 The mechanism observed with piliated GC is that pili twist together, with the tails of the spermato- zoa in a rope-in-a-spiderweb arrangement around the bacteria. Sperm have also been found to be intimately associated with cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma, Ureaplasma urealyticum,44 and CT.51 Motile trichomonads serve as another transporter of PID. They can ascend from the vagina to the fallopian tubes, carrying addi- tional invaders. In fact, it has been observed that trichomonads are never isolated from humans when heavy bacterial contamination is absent.44

## 1678SECTION 6 Diseases


Pelvic or lower abdominal pain is the most dependable symptom of PID; unfortunately, however, it is not specific. Rebound tenderness is not reliably reported; cervical motion tenderness and adnexal ten- derness are much more common. The clinical picture of the various types of PID can easily mislead. In a large study, the clinical diagno- sis of PID was confirmed at laparoscopy in only 65% of the patients. Appendicitis, hemorrhagic corpus luteum, pelvic endometriosis, ecto- pic pregnancy, mesenteric adenitis, and ovarian tumors accounted for 12%, whereas 23% were found to be normal.52 Many PID patients have atypical signs and symptoms, and some have no signs or symptoms at all.11 Table 206.2 lists those most commonly found. The woman with GC may appear more toxic and febrile and manifest leukocytosis, whereas CT-caused PID may give her an ESR. Most episodes of gonococcal PID occur at or shortly after menses.53 Gonococcal PID has a generally more severe clinical picture, but tis- sue damage and long-term sequelae can be more severe in CT. This attempt to differentiate clinical pictures becomes meaningless, of course, in the presence of mixed infections. Any mucopurulent discharge should yield oxygen-sensitive organisms because offensive odor is considered diagnostic of anaer- obic infection. Any woman who has such a discharge probably has well-developed PID, with opportunistic anaerobes following the pri- mary invaders.38 Box 206.1 shows the differential diagnoses of PID. Potentially lethal conditions to consider include ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, ovarian cyst rupture with hemorrhage, and appendicitis. In light of Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome, symptoms from the upper right quadrant in a sexually active woman may be an indirect sign of genital infection. The pain usually has a sudden onset and can over- shadow the signs and symptoms of the underlying PID.37 In the event of rupture of a tubo-ovarian abscess, a sudden severe exacerbation of the pain can be observed. The pain is referred to the side of the rupture and is typically followed by generalized peritonitis and collapse. Shoulder pain may be present. The pulse will likely be ele- vated out of proportion to the fever and is frequently as high as 170.35 Surgery must be performed within 12 hours or mortality becomes probable. A careful history is, as always, invaluable. The patient’s risk factors and history should be assessed for likelihood of infection with a sexu- ally transmitted organism. The patient should be questioned about any new sex partner, method of contraception, and recent medical proce- dures. The source, severity, and characteristics of the pelvic/abdominal pain should be evaluated. Mucopurulent cervicitis should be consid- ered as well, and the cervix should be cultured for GC and CT, with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) performed as well. In a very large retrospective study conducted in Denmark found that a negative test for chlamydia by non-NAAT methodology was associated with a 17% higher risk for PID at 12 months compared with a negative NAAT, highlighting the superior sensitivity of the NAAT.54 Empiric treatment of PID should be initiated in sexually active young women and other women at risk for STDs if they are experi- encing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the symptoms other than PID can be identified, and if one or more of the following minimum criteria are present on pelvic examination: • Cervical motion tenderness or uterine tenderness or adnexal ten- derness The following additional criteria above and beyond the minimum criteria may enhance the diagnosis of PID: • Oral temperature above 101°F or 38.3°C • Abnormal cervical or vaginal mucopurulent discharge, or cervical friability • Presence of abundant numbers of WBCs on saline microscopy of vaginal secretions • Elevated ESR • Elevated C-reactive protein • Laboratory documentation of cervical infection with GC or CT The following criteria for hospitalization are suggested: • Surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded. • The patient is pregnant. • The patient does not respond clinically to oral antimicrobial therapy. • The patient is unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regi- men. • The patient has severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or high fever. • The patient has a tubo-ovarian abscess.


Criteria for hospitalization include surgical emergency or septic-appearing patient, pregnancy, failure to respond to oral antibiotics, and suspicion of tubo-ovarian abscess. Referral is necessary if the diagnosis is uncer- tain or a surgical emergency threatens. Should the physician decide not to hospitalize, a regimen of antibiotic therapy combined with the sup- portive therapies discussed later can be tried if the patient’s clinical and laboratory status can be reassessed in 48 to 72 hours. Laboratory values and objective patient criteria should direct all acute-phase treatment. The

CDC leaves it to the individual practitioner to decide on the severity of the disease and the optimal treatment. Its guidelines do say that “most experts encourage hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics … . No evidence is available to suggest that adolescents have improved out- comes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, and the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women.”55

## Antibiotics

PID is a complex syndrome, with inconsistent and variable presenta- tions in different women and including a range of symptoms and eti- ological microorganisms. Because of this, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens are employed that allow for some flexibility on the part of the practitioner. Regimens are tailored on the basis of clinical severity and laboratory findings, patient compliance, cost of medications, and availability of medications. Because some antibiotics cover only one organism, the CDC outpatient recommendations take into account the limited anaerobic activity of any one regimen.

<!-- chunk -->

## Oral Treatment

Oral therapy can be considered for women with mild to moderately severe acute PID because the clinical outcomes among women treated with oral therapy are similar to those in women treated with parenteral therapy. Women who do not respond to oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and should be given parenteral therapy (see Box 206.2). Fifteen percent of women with PID fail to respond to primary anti- microbial treatment, 20% have at least one recurrence, and 15% are rendered infertile.28 Given the polymicrobial nature of PID, the complexities of isola- tion, antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms, and the realities of recurrence rate with antibiotic use, an approach that combines immune system enhancement and nontoxic therapies concurrently with antibiotics seems sound. However, there are no evidence-based therapies using natural therapies exclusively for the treatment of PID. Antibiotics can help with the first phase of treatment but may not offer sufficient intervention for the devastation that regularly occurs in the wake of the primary infection. aThe recommended third-generation cephalosporins are limited in the coverage of anaerobes. Therefore until it is known that extended anaerobic coverage is not important for treatment of acute PID, the addition of metronidazole to treatment regimens with third-generation cephalosporins should be considered (Source: Walker CK, Wiesenfeld HC.

## Diathermy

In the 1920s and 1930s, pulsed, high-frequency diathermy was first reported to be beneficial in the treatment of women with PID.56–58 Pulsing electric energy for a short duration (65 mcs every mcs) at high intensity achieves the desired therapeutic result with- out the hyperpyrexia typically associated with diathermy. Local recovery is enhanced, the reticuloendothelial system is stimulated, and gamma-globulin fractions are increased.30 There is very little research on using this therapy, and practitioners should be very cautious in using it as a substitute for antibiotic therapy. A small study conducted in 2011 suggests that short-wave diathermy may provide pain relief to women with chronic PID, compared with sham diathermy and analgesic therapy.59

## Sitz Baths

Traditionally, sitz baths have been an important component of the naturopathic treatment of PID. The contrast sitz bath is primarily used to increase pelvic circulation, bring an influx of macrophages to the area, and provide decongestion of the pelvic inflammatory reaction (for further discussion, see Chapter 40).


Vitamin C may be useful in the treatment of women with PID for the following reasons: • Its anti-inflammatory effects help to decrease tissue destruction. • Its support of collagen tissue repair helps to prevent the spread of infection (especially important in GC infections, which can spread through the subepithelial connective tissue, resulting in disorgani- zation of the collagen matrix14). • Its fibrinolytic activity helps to prevent pelvic scarring.

## Beta-Carotene

The normal ovary has a high concentration of beta-carotene. As these structures are bombarded by inflammation and the unwelcome com- pany of aggressive microbes, it is essential to maintain optimal levels of carotene to allow for an optimal defense. Beta-carotene potentiates the beneficial effects of interferon and enhances numerous other immune functions, such as antibody levels and WBC activity.60,61 Beta-carotene is also important as an antioxidant, helping to limit the cell damage induced by the inflammatory process (see Chapter 57 for a full discus- sion of this nutrient).

<!-- chunk -->

## Bromelain

Bromelain should be considered an important component of the treat- ment regimen. Adnexal exudate in PID frequently suppurates to form abscesses. If tissue irritation is relieved or ameliorated during the acute stage, much of the exudate can be absorbed, and fewer adhesions will be formed.56 Adhesions will form as the exudate lingers, the structures being overwhelmed by the inflammation. Also, after resolution, agglu- tination of the villous fold in the lumen of the tube may occur, result- ing in scarring and tubal occlusion.12 Bromelain activates fibrinolysis, which can greatly diminish the enduring sequelae of the inevitable exudate. Bromelain also demon- strates antimicrobial properties, and an Italian study has shown that it penetrates the salpinx62 (see Chapter 59 for further discussion).


When individuals take antibiotics, the gastrointestinal, vaginal, and bladder microflora are disrupted. This can cause side effects with antibiotic use or after such use, including diarrhea, candidal vulvovag- initis, and acute cystitis. Probiotics are generally defined as live micro- organisms whose function is dependent on the ability of a strain to benefit the host when it is administered orally. There are many species and strains that have been proved to have adhesive properties and can proliferate in these organs and thus pre- vent opportunistic overgrowth, as well as the side effects from antibi- otics, and also restore the normal microflora. No one species or strain can be recommended here, but combination products to be considered should include at least one or more of the following: the Lactobacillus species L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, L. rheuteri, and L. acidophilus and the Bifidobacterium species B. bifidum, B. lactis, B. breve, and B. longum. A recent in vitro–based study found that Lactobacillus species, especially L. crispatus, reduced the ability of CT to infect cervical cells. Cervical cells exposed to L. crispatus had a more fluid plasma membrane, with reduced exposure of polar lipids and α 5 β 1 integrin subunits, with the latter potentially a key aspect of preventing CT infection. This same strain appears to inhibit GC infection as well.63,64


Many botanicals have been shown to have antimicrobial and immune-stimulating effects. Allicin extracts from garlic, goldenseal, and Oregon grape root and echinacea should all be considered at least as part of a treatment plan and as adjuncts to antibiotic therapy.

## Vaginal Depletion Packs

The use of the vaginal depletion pack has historically been a part of traditional PID treatment because it promotes the drainage of exudate from the involved tissues. (This is discussed in more detail in Appendix 14.) It may also stimulate the immune cells within the vagina to pro- vide a first line of defense.

## Hydrastis Canadensis

The immune-potentiating specific antimicrobial properties and the general antibacterial nature of goldenseal make it indispensable in the care of PID. Because Hydrastis canadensis is also a trophorestorative to mucous membranes, the herb should be used throughout the rehabili- tation period. (H. canadensis is discussed in more detail in Chapter 86.)

## Prevention

STD prevention is an extremely important issue for all heterosexu- ally and bisexually active women. The woman with no history of PID should still be concerned about the significant population of asymp- tomatic male carriers of STDs. The choice of birth control is pivotal. Women who use barrier methods of contraception have a lower risk of PID.

## Oral Contraceptives

A surprising number of articles laud the use of oral contraceptives (OCs) for their apparent inhibition of GC.30 Burnham28 has suggested OC use after a first episode of PID to prevent recurrence. Apparently, estrogens create a thicker cervical plug, which offers protection against gonococci.14,16 OCs also decrease the length and volume of menstrual flow, thus decreasing the exposure of the GC to this handy culture medium. On the other hand, OC users have a higher risk of chlamydial infec- tions.14,44,53,65 Progesterone can produce cervical eversion, exposing the endocervical columnar epithelium—the target tissue of CT.53 In one of the largest studies to date, an analysis of over 50,000 married women in China found that subdermal implants were associated with a nearly 3.5-fold adjusted increase in risk for PID, whereas no other form of birth control influenced risk. Although not described in

the study, it is likely that most subdermal implants are progesterone based.66 Estradiol has been implicated in suppressing the endocervical antibodies necessary for the resolution of CT.53 Animal experimenta- tion finds that estrogen-treated individuals have a higher number of infected cervical cells and a longer duration of infection.67 Because women are probably not selectively exposed to GC versus CT, OCs are not recommended.

## Intrauterine Devices

The IUD has a bad reputation in PID. This reputation is a carryover from the former Dalkon Shield, which is no longer available. Current IUDs such as the Copper T and the Mirena are generally considered safe. Indeed, a 2017 analysis of 14 studies eligible for review found that either no risk or no clinically meaningful risk for PID was associated with IUD use.68 However, the use of an IUD is associated with a slightly increased risk of PID, especially in the first 3 weeks of use.56 An IUD allows the colonization of bacteria on its surface while simultaneously reducing local immunological capacity.70 If a woman with suspected PID has an IUD, it was previously recommended to be removed to 24 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy in order to prevent the spread of the infection during its removal.11,23,28,31,37,71,72 However, in 2013 the CDC revised its guidelines and instead suggests that if a woman with an IUD is diagnosed with PID, the IUD does not need to be removed, although if no improvement occurs after 48 to 72 hours, removal should be considered.73 A systematic review of the evidence suggests there is no benefit to removal, and it may be that women who do not remove their IUDs have shorter hospitalizations.74

## Barrier Methods

Barrier methods of contraception are excellent choices for the preven- tion of PID. The condom is preferred to cervical protectors because with this method, the sperm more rarely reach the vaginal vault.

<!-- chunk -->

## Douching

Haphazard douching is to be avoided because it disturbs the vaginal flora. All forms of douching increase the risk of PID and can cause organisms to ascend into the upper genital tract. One study compared 100 consecutive patients hospitalized for PID with 762 controls and 119 women suspected of having PID.75 Current douching (defined as any douching during the previous 2 months) was more common among those with PID than among those in both con- trol groups. Among current douchers, PID was related to the frequency of douching. Those who douched three or more times per month were 3.6 times more likely to develop PID than those who douched less than once per month. A much larger study surveyed 6984 women older than 18 years of age and found that 32% said they had douched within the previous week; 13% reported regular douching more than once a week.76

## Intercourse During Menses

Intercourse during menses is not recommended unless a condom is used. GC risk is increased by the loss of the protective cervical mucus plug and by the prevalence of blood, a medium of choice for Gonococcus. The endometrium is also thought to offer local protection against bacte- rial invasion, and it is this layer that is being sloughed off during menses.

## Smoking

When 197 women hospitalized for their first PID infection were com- pared with 667 controls with nongynecological conditions, it was found that cigarette smokers, compared with women who had never smoked, had an elevated risk of PID of 1.7, and former cigarette smokers had an elevated risk of 2.3. There was no dose-response relationship.77 A more rigorous study found similar results. This was a case-con- trolled, population-based study of 131 women between 18 and 40 years of age who were treated for their first episode of PID compared with 294 randomly selected patients from the same health maintenance organization. Current smokers, compared with those who had never smoked, had an increased risk of PID. Women who smoked 10 or more cigarettes a day had a higher risk than those who smoked less.78 A sub- sequent study of nearly 1500 indigenous women living in Queensland found a 3.1-fold increase in risk for PID among smokers, and a 4-fold increase in risk for PID hospitalization was found among women with low serum folate levels.79

## Education

A physician should review the signs and symptoms of PID with all sexually active women and encourage any woman to seek counsel if she appears to fit the clinical picture for PID. The diagnosis is easier to make and the recovery more rapid when treatment is instituted early.


Treatment consists of two phases, both of which are important. The first therapeutic goal is to eliminate all pathogens and normalize the microflora of the adnexa. The second is to rehabilitate the damaged tissues. Women should avoid intercourse until all signs and symptoms are resolved and their male partners have been examined and treated. In addition, all partners from up to 2 months before the illness should be examined28 and treated if a diagnosis of PID is made. Abstinence from sexual intercourse must also accompany all forms of treatment, and retesting at 3 months is suggested for women with a previous diagnosis of GC or CT infection. These therapies are recommended as adjuncts to appropriate anti- biotic treatment and immune support, as discussed in Chapter 136.


All dietary inhibitors of immune function (sugar, alcohol, saturated fats, simple carbohydrates) should be limited during both phases of treatment.


• Vitamin A (only if certain not pregnant): 20,000 IU/d for 2 weeks • Beta-carotene: 100,000 IU/day for 2 or more months • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 400 IU/day for 3 months • Vitamin C: 1000 mg four times a day for the first week of treatment and then decreased over 3 days to 500 mg three times a day • Chlorophyll: 10 mg of fat-/oil-soluble form four times a day for month • Bromelain: 250 mg (1800 milk-clotting units [MCU]) four times a day for the first week and three times a day for 6 weeks • Probiotics supplement: minimum 1 billion CFU per day, consider up to 24 billion CFU per day during antibiotic treatment and for months thereafter


• H. canadensis: 500 mg of the solid extract (4:1 or 8%–12% alkaloid content) three times a day during the acute phase; 250 mg three times a day during recovery • Vaginal packs: daily during the acute phase until there is adequate clinical and laboratory response. After the acute phase, vaginal packs need to be used three times a week, alternating with chloro- phyll douches, for 3 weeks.

• Diathermy: pulsed, high-intensity diathermy for 10 minutes over the suprapubic area, 10 minutes over the liver, and 10 minutes in the area of the left adrenal (the right being presumably stimulated with the liver) • Sitz baths: one to two times/day throughout the acute phase. Con- trast sitz baths are given in groups of three alterations of hot to cold. Two separate tubs are necessary during this process. The hot is at 105°F to 115°F, the cold at 55°F to 85°F, with the temperatures dependent on the patient’s tolerance. The standard treatment is minutes hot and 30 seconds cold, with this cycle being repeated three times in one sitting. The water level in the hot tub is set 1 inch higher than in the cold. Adequate draping is necessary to prevent chilling. As with all hydrotherapy treatments, one always finishes with the cold.

50 years of age test positive for H. pylori.2 However, more than 80% of H. pylori–infected people never actually develop an ulcer.3 Although it is has been discovered that certain genotypic strains of H. pylori may confer additional cytotoxic risk for gastric pathologies,4 conflicting information warrants further research.5,6 The presence of H. pylori is determined by testing the level of antibodies to H. pylori in the blood or saliva, by culturing material collected during an endoscopy, and/or measuring the breath for urea. Low gastric output and low antioxidant content in the gastrointes- tinal mucosa are thought to predispose individuals to H. pylori coloni- zation. This increases gastric pH, thereby setting up a positive-feedback scenario and increasing the likelihood for the colonization of the stom- ach and duodenum with other organisms.7

## Aspirin and Other Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Aspirin and other NSAIDs are associated with a significant risk of pep- tic ulcer as well as increased gut permeability. Long-term low-dose ( ≤ 325 mg) aspirin therapy has been shown to increase the risk of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, as well as a number of other adverse GI events, including excess stomach acid, gastritis, abdominal pain, epi- gastric burning, stomach ulcer, and duodenal ulcer.8,9 The combination of NSAID use and smoking is particularly harm- ful to the ulcer patient.10 Most studies documenting the relative fre- quency of peptic ulcers as a consequence of NSAID use have focused on NSAIDs in the treatment of arthritis and headaches. Although there has been a reduction in ulcers induced by NSAIDs with the development of the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (Rofecoxib, Celecoxib) for arthritic conditions, aspirin-induced ulcers remain an ongoing issue owing to the increased use of aspirin for protection against cardiovascular events.10 The risk of GI bleeding due to peptic ulcers has been evaluated for aspirin at the daily doses of 300, 150, and 75 mg commonly recommended to prevent heart attacks and strokes.11 A review of randomized controlled trials on the gastrointestinal toxic- ity of aspirin revealed that the pooled odds ratio for categories of GI bleeding are between 1.5 and 2.0.12 A study conducted at five test hospitals in England found an increased risk of GI bleeding due to peptic ulcer at all dosage levels. The dosage of 75 mg/day was associated with 40% less bleeding than 300 mg/day and 30% less bleeding than 150 mg/day. The researchers concluded: “No conventionally used prophylactic aspirin regimen seems free of the risk of peptic ulcer complications.”


Individuals experiencing any symptoms of a peptic ulcer need compe- tent medical care. Peptic ulcer complications such as hemorrhage, per- foration, and obstruction represent medical emergencies that require immediate hospitalization. The optimal treatment of a peptic ulcer involves the identification of the causative factor and its appropriate elimination.

## Lifestyle Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Stress and Emotions

Stress is universally believed to be an important factor in the pathogen- esis of peptic ulcers. However, this belief is based primarily on obser- vation. The medical literature is controversial, and every substantial attempt to examine this assumption has been fraught with method- ological errors.13 This is further complicated by the observation that men and women with peptic ulcers appear to have distinctly different psychological profiles. In addition, several studies have shown that the number of stressful life events is not significantly different in peptic ulcer patients compared with carefully selected, ulcer-free controls. These data sug- gest that it is not simply stress but, rather, the patient’s response to stress that is the significant factor. A large prospective study of persons who had no history of peptic ulcer disease revealed that those who perceived more significant stress in their lives were at increased risk for developing peptic ulcers.14 A register-based cohort study found the highest level of perceived everyday life stress had a 2.2-fold increase in the risk of either receiving triple treatment or being diagnosed with peptic ulcer during the following 33 months compared with that of the lowest-stress group (see Chapter 140 for a more complete discussion).15 Psychological factors are likely contributory in some patients with peptic ulcer disease. As a group, ulcer patients have been characterized as tending to repress emotions. Patients should be encouraged to dis- cover enjoyable outlets of self-expression and emotion.

## Smoking

Smoking is related to an increased frequency of peptic ulcers, a decreased response to peptic ulcer therapy, and increased mortality due to peptic ulcers. Three postulated mechanisms for this association are as follows14: • Decreased pancreatic bicarbonate secretion (an important neutral- izer of gastric acid) • Increased reflux of bile salts into the stomach • Acceleration of gastric emptying into the duodenum Bile salts are extremely irritating to the stomach and initial portions of the duodenum. Bile salt reflux induced by smoking appears to be the most likely factor responsible for the greater incidence of peptic ulcer among smokers. In addition, cigarette smoke and its active ingre- dients cause mucosal cell death, inhibit cell renewal, interfere with the mucosal immune system, and decrease blood flow in the GI mucosa.16 The psychological aspects of smoking are also important because the chronic anxiety and psychological stress associated with smoking appear to worsen ulcer activity.

## Food Allergy

Clinical and experimental evidence points to food allergy as a prime etiological factor.17–20 The lesions of peptic ulcers and the Arthus reac- tion (a local inflammatory response due to deposition of immune complexes in tissues) show the same microanatomic changes.2 In one study, 98% of patients with radiographic evidence of a peptic ulcer had coexisting lower and upper respiratory tract allergic disease.19 In another study, 25 of 43 allergic children had x-ray–diagnosed peptic ulcers.20 Clinically, an elimination diet has been used with great suc- cess in treating and preventing recurrent ulcers.18,19 Food allergy is also consistent with the high recurrence rate of peptic ulcers. Ironically, many people with peptic ulcers soothe themselves by consuming milk, a highly allergic food. Milk should be avoided on this basis alone. However, there is additional evidence suggesting that milk should be avoided by patients with peptic ulcers. For example, popu- lation studies show that the higher the milk consumption, the greater the likelihood of ulcer, and milk significantly increases the production of stomach acid.21

## Fiber

A diet rich in fiber and low in refined sugar is associated with a reduced rate of duodenal ulcers compared with a low-fiber diet.3 The thera- peutic use of a high-fiber diet in patients with recently healed duode- nal ulcers reduces the recurrence rate by one half.22 This is probably a result of fiber’s ability to delay gastric emptying of the liquid phase, counteracting the rapid movement of this phase into the duodenum, which is normally seen in ulcer patients. Although several fibers often

used to supplement the diet (e.g., pectin, guar gum, psyllium) have been shown to produce beneficial effects, a diet rich in plant foods is best.23,24

## Cabbage

Raw cabbage juice has been well documented as having remarkable success in treating peptic ulcers.25–27 One liter per day of the fresh juice, taken in divided doses, resulted in total ulcer healing in an average of only 10 days. Further research has shown that the high glutamine con- tent of the juice is likely responsible for the efficacy of cabbage in treat- ing ulcers. In a double-blind clinical study of 57 patients, 24 using 1.6 g/day of glutamine and 33 using conventional therapy (antacids, anti- spasmodics, diet, milk, and a bland diet), glutamine proved to be the more effective treatment.28 One half of the glutamine patients showed complete healing (according to radiographic analysis) within 2 weeks, and 22 of the 24 showed complete relief and healing within 4 weeks. The authors postulated these results may arise from the role of gluta- mine in the biosynthesis of the hexosamine moiety in certain muco- proteins. This could stimulate mucin synthesis, which would benefit peptic ulcer patients. In addition, cabbage-family isothiocyanates like sulforaphane (SF) have shown considerable activity against H. pylori. In one dou- ble-blind study, 48 H. pylori–infected patients were randomly assigned to feedings of broccoli sprouts (70 g/day; containing μ mol of SF precursor) for 8 weeks or to consumption of an equal weight of alfalfa sprouts (not containing SF) as placebo.29 Intervention with broccoli sprouts but not with placebo decreased the levels of urease measured by the urea breath test and H. pylori stool antigen (both biomarkers of H. pylori colonization) and serum pepsinogens I and II (biomark- ers of gastric inflammation). Values recovered to their original levels 2 months after treatment was discontinued.

## Bismuth Subcitrate

Bismuth is a naturally occurring mineral that can act as an antacid; it also exerts activity against H. pylori. The best-known and most widely used bismuth preparation is bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol). However, bismuth subcitrate has produced the best results against H. pylori and in the treatment of peptic ulcers.28,30 In the United States, bismuth subcitrate preparations are available through com- pounding pharmacies (to find a compounding pharmacist in your area, call the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists at 1-800-927-4227). A key advantage of bismuth preparations over standard antibiotic approaches to eradicating H. pylori is that the bacteria are unlikely to develop resistance to bismuth. As concerns in the medical community grow regarding the failures of current regimens due to drug resistance, nonpharmacological management options are becoming required.31 In India for example, 80% of isolates from 259 peptic ulcer patients tested showed resistance to metronidazole.32 Although resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was minimal (1%–4%), it is evident from recent medical history that greater resistance to these antibiot- ics will continue to develop. This makes bismuth a rational treatment choice to prevent the further development of recalcitrant strains. The usual dosage for bismuth subcitrate is 240 mg twice daily before meals. For bismuth subsalicylate, the dosage is 500 mg four times daily. Bismuth preparations are extremely safe when taken at prescribed dos- ages. Bismuth subcitrate may cause a temporary and harmless darken- ing of the tongue, stool, or both. Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by children recovering from the flu, chickenpox, or other viral infections because it may mask the nausea and vomiting associated with Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness.

## Polyphenols

Dietary polyphenols with multiple biological mechanisms of action play a pivotal part in the management of gastric and duodenal ulcers. A review study evaluated the potential effects of commonly used dietary polyphenols in the prevention and/or treatment of peptic ulcer based on cellular, preclinical, and clinical studies, along with the possible molecular and intracellular mechanisms.33 The study confirmed that dietary polyphenols possess protective and therapeutic potential in peptic ulcer mediated by improving cytoprotection, reepithelializa- tion, neovascularization, and angiogenesis; upregulating tissue growth factors and prostaglandins; downregulating antiangiogenic factors; enhancing endothelial nitric oxide synthase-derived NO; suppressing oxidative mucosal damage; amplifying antioxidant performance and antacid and antisecretory activity; increasing endogenous mucosal defensive agents; and blocking H. pylori colonization–associated gastric morphological changes and gastroduodenal inflammation and ulcer- ation. In addition, anti-inflammatory activity due to down regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and cellular and intercellular adhesion agents, suppressing leukocyte-endothelium interaction, inhibiting nuclear signaling pathways of inflammatory process, and modulating intracellular transduction and transcription pathways have key roles in the antiulcer action of dietary polyphenols.

## Flavonoids

Flavonoids are known to counteract both the production and secretion of histamine, an important factor in ulcer formation. They are gener- ally regarded as antiallergy compounds. The use of these compounds seems particularly indicated owing to the probable allergic etiology of peptic ulcers. Catechin, via its ability to inhibit histidine decarboxylase, offers antiulcer activity. Animal studies have demonstrated that catechin has significant antiulcer activity in various models.34,35 In a human clin- ical study, oral administration (1000 mg five times daily) resulted in reduced histamine levels in the gastric tissue (determined by biopsy) of normal patients and in those with gastric and duodenal ulcers and acute gastritis.35 It was also demonstrated that histamine levels, which significantly increase in patients with urticaria and food allergy after the local application of the antigen to the gastric mucosa, could be decreased by the prior administration of catechin. In one study, several flavonoids were shown to inhibit H. pylori in a clear-cut concentration-dependent manner.36 In addition, unlike antibiotics, the flavonoids were also shown to augment natural defense factors that prevent ulcer formation. The activity of flavone, the most potent flavonoid in the study, was shown to be similar to that of bis- muth subcitrate. Sofalcone—a synthetic derivative of sophoradin, a flavonoid found in Sophora tonkinensis, an herb used in traditional Chinese medi- cine—has shown good results in healing ulcers after the eradication of H. pylori.37,38 Vitamins A and E have been shown to inhibit the development of stress ulcers in rats and are important in maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier.39,40 High-dose vitamin A therapy was shown to be useful in the treatment of chronic gastric ulcers in one clinical trial.41 Zinc increases mucin production in vitro and has been shown to have a protective effect on peptic ulcers in animals and a curative effect in humans.42,43 Melatonin has been shown in experimental studies to be successful in mitigating the breakdown of the gastric lining and resultant ulcer formation.44 Because this research has focused more on hypersecretion situations, melatonin may be more applicable for duodenal ulcer con- ditions, where the acid secretion is generally increased.

## Glycyrrhiza glabra. Licorice has historically been regarded

as an excellent medicine for peptic ulcer. However, owing to the known aldosterone-like side effects of glycyrrhizinic acid (GA), a procedure was developed to remove GA from licorice and thus to form deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL). The result is a very successful antiulcer agent without any known side effects (see Chapter 85).7,45–49 The proposed mechanism of DGL is the stimulation or acceleration of the differentiation of glandular cells as well as the formation and secretion mucus.45 Clinical studies have demonstrated no significant differences in recurrence rates between cimetidine and DGL drug reg- imens, and rat and human studies have shown the efficacy of DGL in preventing aspirin-induced ulceration and gastric bleeding.47-49 DGL may affect H. pylori because DGL is composed of sev- eral flavonoids that have been shown to inhibit H. pylori.36,50 In a double-blind clinical trial study, 60 patients with peptic ulcer disease and positive rapid urease test were enrolled to evaluate licorice com- pared with bismuth in quadruple regimen on the eradication of H. pylori.51 The patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups. In the first group, licorice, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and omeprazole were prescribed, and in the second (control) group, bismuth subsa- licylate, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and omeprazole were prescribed. After 4 weeks of treatment, a urea breath test was done in all patients to evaluate H. pylori eradication. Response to treatment was observed in 20 (67%) and 17 (57%) patients of the case and control groups, respec- tively (P > 0.05). Therefore licorice may be as effective as bismuth in H. pylori eradication, and in patients for whom bismuth is contraindi- cated, licorice may be a safe alternative. It appears that to be effective in healing peptic ulcers, DGL must mix with saliva. DGL may promote the release of salivary compounds that stimulate the growth and regeneration of stomach and intestinal cells. DGL in capsule form has not been shown to be effective. The standard dosage for DGL is two to four 380-mg chewable tab- lets between meals or 20 minutes before meals. Taking DGL after meals is associated with poor results. DGL therapy should be continued for at least 8 to 16 weeks after a full therapeutic response.

## Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus). Mastic is a resin obtained from the

mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus). In Greece it is known as the “tears of Chios,” being traditionally produced on the Greek island of Chios. Like other natural resins, it is produced in “tears” or droplets. Originally liquid, it is sun-dried into drops of hard, brittle, translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright white, opaque gum. The flavor is bitter at first, but after chewing, the gum releases a refreshing, slightly piney or cedar flavor. People in the Mediterranean region have used mastic gum as a medicine for GI ailments for several thousand years. Studies indicate that it may have benefit in healing peptic ulcers. In a double-blind clinical trial carried out on 38 patients with symp- tomatic and endoscopically proved duodenal ulcer, patients were given either mastic gum (1 g daily) or a placebo for 2 weeks.52 Symptomatic relief was obtained in 16 (80%) patients on mastic gum and 9 (50%) patients on placebo, whereas endoscopically proved healing occurred in 14 (70%) patients on mastic gum and 4 (22%) patients on placebo. In another study, 52 patients with H. pylori infection were random- ized to receive either 350 mg three times daily of pure mastic gum for 14 days (group A), 1.05 g three times daily of pure mastic gum for days (group B), pantoprazole 20 mg twice daily plus pure mastic gum 350 mg three times daily for 14 days (group C), or pantoprazole mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1g twice daily plus clarithromycin mg twice daily for 10 days (group D).53 Eradication of H. pylori was confirmed in 4 of 13 patients in group A and 5 of 13 in group B. No patient in group C achieved eradication, whereas 10 of 13 patients in group D did. These results confirm that mastic gum has some bacteri- cidal activity on H. pylori in vivo but not enough to produce consistent clinical eradication.

## Rheum species. In cases of active intestinal bleeding, rhubarb

(Rheum species) preparations can be extremely effective. In one double-blind study, three kinds of alcohol-extracted rhubarb tablets were studied (Rheum officinale Baill; Rheum palmatum L.; Rheum tanguticum Maxim ex Balf).54 Their efficacies in a group of 312 cases of bleeding gastric and duodenal ulcers were 90.7%, 93.7%, and 92.8%, respectively. The time taken for the stool occult blood to change from positive to negative was 57.1, 53.4, and 56 hours, respectively. The beneficial actions are due to the presence of astringent anthraquinones and flavonoids.

## Plantain banana. In rats, the dried extract of the unripe plantain

banana (Musa sapientum var. paradisiaca) has been found to have antiulcerogenic activity against various experimentally induced ulcers.55–57 This effect appears to be similar to that of DGL (i.e., stimulation of mucosal cell growth rather than inhibition of gastric acid secretion).

## Zingiber officinale. Ginger root (Zingiber officinale) has

traditionally been used for the treatment of GI ailments such as indigestion, motion sickness, and nausea associated with pregnancy. One study used in vitro experimentation to test a methanol extract of ginger root as an agent against 19 strains of H. pylori. Results showed that growth was inhibited against all 19 strains.58 Although more research is required to characterize the best form of this botanical medicine and to learn of its efficacy in actual patients, given its safety profile and cost-effectiveness, it is certainly worth a try.

## Artemisia douglasiana. Growing on the western slopes of the

Rockies, Artemisia douglasiana has been used as a folk remedy in Argentina to treat gastric ulcers and skin lesions since the late 1960s. A. douglasiana and its active constituent dehydroleucodine are known to act as potent antioxidants, and like DGL and plantain, they confer protection to the gastric lining via significantly enhanced secretion of mucus.59,60

## Allium sativum. People whose diets are high in garlic and onions

are well known to have a lower incidence of stomach cancer. H. pylori is a risk factor for stomach cancer as well as peptic ulcers, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that garlic does indeed inhibit its growth. Also noteworthy is the report that garlic can be useful for antibiotic-resistant strains.61 The author of this paper points out that human clinical trials are necessary to verify the efficacy of this low-cost treatment option.


A novel approach to the reduction of H. pylori–associated gastric pathology is found in the administration of the probiotic bacte- rium Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 (LRY), the generic variant of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). This gastrointestinal isolate inhibits H. pylori by competition for substrate and binding sites as well as the production of antimicrobial compounds such as lactic acid. In addition, it attenuates the host’s H. pylori–induced apoptosis and inflammation responses and stimulates angiogenesis in the gastric and duodenal epithelium. Although LRY is not able to eradicate H. pylori completely, its cosupplementation in antibiotic eradication therapy has been shown to relieve the side effects of this therapy.62 A systematic review of randomized controlled trials in colonized adults and chil- dren confirmed that probiotics do not eradicate H. pylori but maintain lower levels of this pathogen in the stomach and, in combination with

antibiotics, may increase eradication rate, decrease therapy-related adverse effects, and alleviate most disease-related clinical symptoms.63


Peptic ulcer disease should be recognized as a heterogeneous group of disorders with a common final pathway leading to an ulcerative lesion in either the gastric or duodenal mucosa. Patients must be carefully evaluated to determine which of the previously mentioned factors is most relevant to their health problem. This is difficult, and a more gen- eral approach may be necessary. The first step is to identify and eliminate or reduce all factors impli- cated in the etiology of peptic ulcers: food allergy, cigarette smoking, stress, and drugs—especially aspirin and other NSAIDs. Although short-term antibiotics may be necessary, a nonmicrobial approach for H. pylori–associated gastritis with long-term phytochemicals or other natural agents has been shown to be efficacious.64 Once the causative factors have been controlled, attention should be directed at healing the ulcers, inhibiting exacerbating factors (e.g., reducing excess acid secre- tion if present), and promoting tissue resistance. Finally, the proper diet and lifestyle should be developed to prevent further recurrence. Peptic ulcer complications—hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction—represent medical emergencies that require immediate hospitalization.

## Psychological Considerations

The physician should assist the patient in developing an effective stress reduction program, eliminating or controlling stressors, and designing a regular relaxation plan.


The patient should eliminate allergic food, eat foods high in dietary fiber and polyphenols and low in refined sugars, and eat various mem- bers of the cabbage family and garlic.

## 1690SECTION 6 Diseases

gingival sulcus is ideal for bacterial growth because it is resistant to the washing and cleansing action of saliva. Furthermore, the gingival fluid (sulcular fluid) provides a rich nutrient source for microorganisms. The clinical determination of the depth of the gingival sulcus is an important diagnostic parameter. Patients with periodontal disease should be mon- itored; biannual visits to the dentist should be sufficient in most cases.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacterial Factors

Bacterial plaque has long been considered the etiological agent in most forms of periodontal disease. However, host defense factors are unde- niably another key factor. Bacteria are known to produce and secrete numerous compounds that are quite detrimental to the status of the host’s defense mechanisms. These compounds include: • Endotoxins and exotoxins • Free radicals and collagen-destroying enzymes • Leukotoxins • Bacterial antigens, waste products, and toxic compounds

<!-- chunk -->

## Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) constitute a first line of defense against microbial overgrowth. Defects in PMN functions are “catastrophic” to the periodontium. PMN functions are depressed in the geriatric population as well as in patients with diabetes, Crohn’s disease, Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, Down syndrome, and juvenile periodontitis. These patients are at extremely high risk for developing rapidly progressing periodontal disease, as are people with transient neutropenia. Transient defects in PMN function may be responsible for the periods of quiescence and exacerbation noted in periodontal disease. In addition to serving a vital role in protecting against peri- odontal disease, PMNs also play a major role in tissue destruction. PMNs release numerous free radicals, collagenases, hyaluronidases, inflammatory mediators, and an osteoclast stimulator.

<!-- chunk -->

## Macrophages and Monocytes

These leukocytes are found in increased numbers in periodontal dis- ease. They serve to phagocytize bacteria and debris and are the primary source of prostaglandins in the diseased gingiva, releasing large quan- tities of enzymes believed to play a major role in collagen destruction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lymphocytes

The major role lymphocytes play in periodontal disease involves lym- phokine production. Their role in periodontal disease is overshadowed by the roles of the other immune system components discussed, but lymphokines are involved in promoting PMN and monocyte chemo- taxis, fibroblast destruction, and osteoclast activation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Complement

The complement system is composed of at least 22 proteins and accounts for more than 10% of the total serum globulin. On activa- tion, complement components act in a cascade fashion. Complement can be activated via the classic or alternative pathway. The comple- ment system plays a critical role in immunological and nonspecific resistance to infection and in the pathogenesis of tissue injury. The products of complement activation regulate several events, includ- ing the release of mediators from mast cells; promotion of smooth muscle contraction; chemotaxis of PMNs, monocytes, and eosino- phils; and phagocytosis by immune adherence. The net effect is an increase in gingival permeability, resulting in the increased penetra- tion of bacteria and bacterial by-products and the initiation of a pos- itive-feedback cycle. Other effects of complement activation include solubilization of immune complexes, cell membrane lysis, neutralization of viruses, and the killing of bacteria. In periodontal disease, activation of comple- ment via the alternative pathway within the periodontal pocket is pos- sibly the major factor in tissue destruction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Mast Cells and Immunoglobulin E

Mast cell degranulation is also a major factor in periodontal disease. Degranulation results in the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, kinins, serotonin, heparin, and serine proteases). Mast cell degranulation can be initiated by IgE complexes, complement components, mechanical trauma, endotox- ins, and free radicals. The finding of increased IgE concentrations in the gingivae of patients with periodontal disease suggests that allergic reactions may be a factor in the progression of the disease in some patients, especially those with atopic disease.3

## Amalgam Restorations

Faulty dental restorations and prostheses are common causes of gin- gival inflammation and periodontal destruction. Overhanging mar- gins provide an ideal location for the accumulation of plaque and the multiplication of bacteria. If the restoration is a silver amalgam fill- ing, there may be even more involvement due to decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes. Mercury accumulation results in a depletion TNF-α TNF-α Elevated levels of cytokines e.g., TNF-α Periodontal diseases Insulin resistance

of the free-radical–scavenging enzymes glutathione peroxidase, super- oxide dismutase, and catalase.4 The proteoglycans and glycosamino- glycans of the collagen matrix are particularly sensitive to free-radical damage.

<!-- chunk -->

## Miscellaneous Local Factors

Numerous local factors favor the progression of periodontal disease. These include the following: • Food impaction • Unreplaced missing teeth • Malocclusion • Tongue thrusting • Bruxism • Toothbrush trauma • Mouth breathing • Tobacco (discussed later)

<!-- chunk -->

## Tobacco and Alcohol

Tobacco smoking is associated with increased susceptibility to severe periodontal disease and tooth loss.5,6 Many of the harmful effects of tobacco smoking result from free-radical damage, partic- ularly to epithelial cells. Furthermore, smoking greatly reduces the levels of ascorbic acid, thereby potentiating its damaging effects.7 Flavonoids have been shown to greatly reduce some of the toxic effects of smoking.8,9 In addition to cigarette smoking, there is a dose-dependent asso- ciation between alcohol consumption and periodontal disease.9 Presumably, the combination of smoking and drinking alcohol pro- duces an even greater negative effect on periodontal health.

<!-- chunk -->

## Structure and Integrity of the Collagen Matrix

The collagen matrix of the periodontal membrane serves as periosteum to the alveolar bone and enables the dissipation of the tremendous amount of pressure exerted during mastication. The status of the collagen matrix of the periodontium, specifically the extracellular proteoglycans of the gingival epithelium, determines the rate of diffusion and the permeability of inflammatory mediators, bacteria and their by-products, and destruc- tive enzymes from the oral cavity.10,11 Owing to the high rate of protein turnover in periodontal collagen, the integrity of the collagen matrix in this area is extremely vulnerable to atrophy when the necessary cofactors for collagen synthesis (e.g., protein; vitamins C, B 6 , and A; zinc; copper) are absent or deficient. Poor wound healing is associated with increased risk for periodontal disease.12 The collagen of the periodontium is particularly rich in glycosami- noglycans. Heparin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 are the major glycosaminoglycans present. Stabilization of collagen is the major treatment goal (see later).

<!-- chunk -->

## Environmental Toxicants

Polymorphism of N-acetyltransferase 2, an enzyme involved in Phase II metabolism of xenobiotics, is associated with periodontitis; sub- jects with the slow-acetylating genotype had more severe periodon- tal disease.13 Lead is a xenobiotic that has significant effects on bone metabolism and may therefore increase the risk of periodontal disease. Prevalence ratios for periodontitis when comparing individuals with blood lead levels (BLLs) >7 μ g/dL with those with a BLL of <3 μ g/ dL were 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.02–2.85) for men and 3.80 (95% CI; 1.66–8.73) for women.14 In addition, workers exposed to acid fumes or chemicals in an oil company reported a higher risk of periodontal disease.15 Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can increase the risk of periodontal disease through the disturbance of the immune system. A cross-sectional study investigated associations of concentrations of serum POPs with the prevalence of periodontal disease in adults ≥ 20 years of age.16 Among several POPs, organochlorine (OC) pesticides were most strongly associated with periodontal disease. Polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins also showed significant positive associations with either or both clinical attachment loss ≥ 4 mm and/or the presence of pocket depth ≥ 4 mm (i.e., definitions of periodontal disease). It was concluded that POPs, especially OC pesticides, were positively associated with periodontal disease, particularly through immunomodulation due to OC pesticide exposure.


Therapeutic goals in treating periodontal disease from a nutritional perspective include the following: • Decreasing wound healing time (because the time span for wound healing is longer in patients who are more susceptible to periodon- tal disease17) • Improving membrane and collagen integrity • Decreasing inflammation and free-radical damage (inflammation can induce a vicious cycle and promote periodontal disease) • Enhancing immune status (defects in the immune system, particu- larly PMNs, are catastrophic to the periodontium) In general, periodontal disease and dental caries are a sensitive alarm bell for an unhealthy diet, which predicts the future onset of the diseases of civilizations.18 A small pilot study demonstrated how quickly following a healthier diet produces results.19 The experimental group changed from the standard American diet to a diet low in car- bohydrates and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins C and D, antiox- idants, and dietary fiber for 4 weeks. Participants of the control group did not change their dietary behavior. Plaque index, gingival bleeding, probing depths, and bleeding upon probing were assessed by a dentist with a pressure-sensitive periodontal probe. Measurements were per- formed after 1 and 2 weeks without a dietary change (baseline), fol- lowed by a 2-week transitional period, and finally performed weekly for 4 weeks. Plaque index values did not change in either group, but all inflammatory parameters decreased in the experimental group to approximately half that of the baseline values and were significantly different compared with those of the control group. The severity of periodontal disease is closely associated with micro- nutrient intake.20 Specifically, insufficient intake of vitamin A, B 1 , C, and E and iron, folate, and phosphorus is significantly associated with the severity of periodontal disease.


Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) plays a major role in preventing periodontal disease, as is evident from many early experimental studies.17,21–23 The classic symptom of gingivitis seen in scurvy illustrates the vital func- tion of vitamin C in maintaining the integrity of membrane and colla- gen as well as supporting immunocompetence. Deficiency of vitamin C is associated with defective formation and maintenance of collagen, ground substance, and intercellular cement substance in mesenchymal tissue. The deficiency effects on bone include retardation or cessation of osteoid formation, impaired osteoblastic activity, and osteoporosis. Subclinical vitamin C deficiency plays a significant role in periodontal disease via these effects, which also include delayed wound healing. Decreased vitamin C levels are also associated with increased per- meability of the oral mucosa to endotoxin and bacterial by-products as well as impaired leukocyte functions (particularly regarding PMNs). The role vitamin C plays in increasing chemotaxis and phagocytosis by PMNs is best exemplified by its effect on Chédiak–Higashi syndrome.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1692SECTION 6 Diseases

This autosomal recessive trait is associated with compromised PMN and monocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis, all of which are respon- sive to vitamin C supplementation. This syndrome is also associated with an extremely rapidly progressing periodontitis. Vitamin C also enhances lymphoproliferative response to mitogens and increases interferon levels, antibody response, immunoglobulin levels, and the secretion of thymic hormones. Vitamin C also pos- sesses significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and decreases wound healing time.


Low vitamin D status is associated with both gingivitis and periodontal disease. In a study that analyzed data from 77,503 gingival units (teeth) in 6700 never smokers ages 13 to 90, those with the highest levels of vitamin D had a 30% decreased incidence of gingivitis.24 This was con- sistent across racial or ethnic groups and was similar among men and women as well as among users and nonusers of vitamin and mineral supplements. Similarly, in periodontal disease, supplementation with vitamin D reduces bone loss, with men in the highest quintile experi- encing 39% less bone loss and women experiencing 26% less.25 Further strengthening the case for the causal role of vitamin D deficiency, a study found a much higher incidence of the TT VDR (vitamin D recep- tor) polymorphism and aggressive periodontitis.26 Low vitamin D status likely contributes to the link between peri- odontal disease and breast cancer in women.27

## Sucrose

Sugar is known to significantly increase plaque accumulation while simultaneously decreasing PMN chemotaxis and phagocytosis. This inhibition of PMN function is due to osmotic effects and competition with vitamin C. Vitamin C and glucose are known to compete for intracellular transport sites, with this intracellular transport being largely insulin dependent. (See Chapter 136 for further information on nutrient fac- tors and immune function.) Considering the average American consumes in excess of 175 g/ day of sucrose and other refined carbohydrates, it is safe to say that most Americans have a chronically depressed immune status that puts them at increased risk for periodontal disease. The clinical reduction of refined carbohydrates is certainly advisable and seems to significantly reduce gingival inflammation.


Vitamin A deficiency predisposes people to periodontal disease. Deficiency of vitamin A is associated with the following: • Keratinizing metaplasia of the gingival epithelium • Early karyolysis of gingival epithelial cells • Inflammatory infiltration and degeneration • Periodontal pocket formation • Gingival calculus formation • Increased susceptibility to infection • Abnormal alveolar bone formation Vitamin A is necessary for collagen synthesis and wound heal- ing, maintaining the integrity of epithelial and mucosal surfaces and their secretions, and enhancing numerous immune functions. Beta- carotene may be a more advantageous supplement owing to its affinity for epithelial tissue and potent antioxidant activity (see Chapter 57, Beta-Carotene and Other Carotenoids).

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc and Copper

The severity of periodontal disease is positively associated with increased serum copper levels, whereas zinc levels are significantly decreased (i.e., an increased copper-to-zinc ratio).28 This is consistent with other causes of chronic inflammation and signifies the activation of metallothionein, which increases ceruloplasmin formation while increasing zinc sequestration in response to inflammation. The importance of zinc in treating periodontal disease cannot be overstated. In the United States, marginal zinc deficiency is wide- spread, particularly in the elderly. This may be a factor in the increas- ing prevalence of periodontal disease with age, although the geriatric population is at higher risk for the development of numerous nutrient deficiencies. The functions of zinc in the gingiva and periodontium include the following29: • Stabilization of membranes • Inhibition of calcium influxes • Antioxidant activity • A metallocomponent in at least 40 enzymes, including those for DNA, RNA, and collagen synthesis • Inhibition of plaque growth • Inhibition of mast cell degranulation • Numerous immune activities, including increased PMN chemo- taxis and phagocytosis • Promotion of wound healing The positive effects of zinc in established periodontal disease are also due to its action on calcium- and calmodulin-mediated processes such as mast cell degranulation, tissue damage induced by endotoxin, and increased vascular permeability. These calcium-mediated events are responsible for much of the tissue destruction seen in periodontal disease. Regular (twice-daily) use of a mouthwash that contains a 5% zinc solution inhibits plaque growth.29 However, lower concentrations or less frequent mouth washing are not particularly successful.

<!-- chunk -->

## Vitamin E and Selenium

Vitamin E and selenium function synergistically in antioxidant mech- anisms and potentiate each other’s effects. Vitamin E alone has been demonstrated to be of considerable value in patients with severe peri- odontal disease. This can largely be attributed to the decreased wound healing time. The antioxidant effects of vitamin E are particularly needed if mercury amalgam is present. Mercury depletes the tissues of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxi- dase, and catalase. In animal studies, this toxic effect of mercury is pre- vented by supplementation with vitamin E.4 Selenium and vitamin E’s antioxidant activities also deter periodontal disease because the effects of free radicals are extremely damaging to gingival proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans.

## Coenzyme Q

<!-- chunk -->

## 10

Ubiquinone, an essential coenzyme involved in mitochondrial oxi- dative phosphorylation, is also an effective antioxidant. Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ) is widely used in Japan for many conditions, including periodontal disease. A review of seven studies using CoQ 10 found that 70% of the 332 patients involved responded favorably to supplemen- tation.30 A double-blind study comprising 56 subjects found that the supplemented group responded significantly, whereas the placebo group displayed very little change in periodontal pocket depth and tooth mobility.31

<!-- chunk -->

## Flavonoids

Flavonoids are extremely effective in reducing inflammation and stabi- lizing collagen structures. Flavonoids affect collagen structure by: • Decreasing membrane permeability, thereby decreasing the load of inflammatory mediators and bacterial products • Preventing free radical damage with their potent antioxidant prop- erties

<!-- chunk -->

## 1693CHAPTER 208 Periodontal Disease

• Inhibiting enzymatic cleavage by hyaluronidases and collagenases • Inhibiting mast cell degranulation • Cross-linking with collagen fibers directly In addition, flavonoids may counteract the proinflammatory effects exerted by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) proteins through Toll-like receptor (TLR) responses.32 Flavonoids also exert significant antibiofilm activities against bacteria that play an essential role in the development of dental caries and periodontal disease.33 The more biologically active flavonoids (e.g., anthocyanidins and pro- anthocyanidins) are recommended because rutin has little collagen-stabi- lizing effect. Proanthocyanidins of grape seed extract have been reported to possess a wide range of biological properties that are useful against periodontal disease.34 In one animal study, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSE) strongly decreased the production of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by murine macrophages stim- ulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of periodontopathogens.35 The flavonoid components of Camellia sinensis (green tea) have demonstrated activity against gingival bacteria and also have direct anti-inflammatory effects. Epidemiological studies have shown green tea intake to protect against periodontal disease and tooth loss.36 In a study involving hydroxypropylcellulose strips impregnated with green tea cat- echin, the pocket depth and the proportion of pathogenic bacteria were markedly decreased.37 A double-blind study using soft candy infused with green tea catechin indicated that the green tea soft chews signifi- cantly reduced plaque and the degree of gingival inflammation.38 A dou- ble-blind study also showed that chewing gum containing procyanidolic oligomers also minimizes gingival bleeding and plaque accumulation.39

<!-- chunk -->

## Folic Acid

The use of folate, either topically or systemically, in double-blind studies produced significant reductions of gingival inflammation as determined by reduction in color changes, bleeding tendency, gingival exudate flow, and plaque scores.40–44 The folate mouthwash, 0.1% folic acid, is signifi- cantly more effective than oral supplementation of either 2 or 5 mg/day, suggesting a local mechanism of action.42,43 Folate has been demonstrated to bind plaque-derived endotoxin.42,43 The use of folate mouthwash is particularly indicated for pregnant women and oral contraceptive users as well as for conditions associated with an exaggerated gingival inflam- matory response or folate antimetabolites (e.g., phenytoin, methotrexate). Epithelial cells of the cervix and the oral cavity appear to suffer from a similar “end-organ” deficiency of folic acid under the hormonal influ- ences of pregnancy and oral contraceptive use. The cervical dysplasia associated with oral contraceptive use also responds to pharmacologi- cal doses of folic acid (i.e., 8–30 mg/day).45,46 (Whitehead’s work45 was the inspiration for the use of folic acid by Pack and Thomson42,43 in the treatment of gingivitis of pregnancy.) The sera and leukocytes of pregnant women and oral contraceptive users contain a macromole- cule that binds folate, which, more than malabsorption or decreased intake, appears to be the major factor for end-organ folate deficiency.47 The beneficial effects of folic acid are not limited to women; it also improves gingivitis and periodontitis.44


Several botanical compounds have shown an ability to inhibit plaque formation. Perhaps the most popular botanical medicine is a tooth- paste containing an alcoholic extract of Sanguinaria canadensis (blood- root). Although the extract contains a mixture of benzophenanthridine alkaloids, sanguinarine is the primary alkaloid available in commercial toothpastes and mouth rinses. Sanguinarine demonstrates proper- ties useful in preventing the formation of dental plaque having broad antimicrobial activity as well as anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro studies indicate that the antiplaque action of sanguinaria is due to its ability to inhibit bacterial adherence. Electron microscopical studies of bacteria exposed to sanguinarine demonstrate that bacteria aggregate and become morphologically irregular.48 Sanguinarine appears to be less effective than chlorhexidine mouthwash, but it is effective in many cases and does have the advantage of being a natural compound versus a synthetic.49,50 The triterpenoid extract of Centella asiatica (gotu kola) is another useful botanical medicine in periodontal disease. This extract has demonstrated impressive wound healing properties (see Chapter 64). One study demonstrated that Centella extract was helpful in speeding up recovery after laser surgery for severe peri- odontal disease.


No clear guidelines exist for determining which factors are most important for a given patient. Therefore a general approach is rec- ommended. Patients who smoke should be advised to stop because continued smoking greatly decreases the success of any therapy for periodontal disease. Considering that factors that increase the risk for osteoporosis (e.g., low calcium and vitamin D, cigarette smoking) also predispose individuals to the risk for periodontal disease and tooth loss, attention should be directed to Chapter 203 in addition to the recommendations provided here.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hygiene

Patients should visit a dentist periodically to eliminate accumulated plaque and calculus. Brushing after meals and daily flossing are necessary.


A diet high in dietary fiber may have a protective effect via increased salivary secretion.24 Avoidance of sucrose and all refined carbohydrates is extremely important.


• Vitamin C: 3 to 5 g/day in divided doses • Vitamin D: 2000 to 6000 IU/day • Vitamin E: 400 to 800 IU/day • Beta-carotene 50,000 IU/day • Selenium: 400 mcg/day • Zinc: 30 mg/day; used as a mouthwash with 15 mL of a 5% solution twice a day • Folic acid (activated form preferred): 800 mcg/day; used as a mouthwash with 15 mL of a 0.1% solution twice a day


High-flavonoid–containing extracts such as those from bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), hawthorn (Crataegus species), grape seed (Vitis vinifera), or green tea (Camellia sinensis) can be used according to the dosages in the corresponding chapters. Of these extracts, grape seed extract or green tea extract (or the liberal consumption of green tea as a beverage) may offer the greatest protection. For a grape seed extract with a 95% proanthocyanidolic oligomer content or a green tea extract with a 90% polyphenol content, the dosage would be 150 to 300 mg a day. Additional recommendations include the following: • Sanguinaria canadensis: toothpaste containing extract • Centella asiatica triterpenoids: 30 mg twice a day of pure triter- penoids

## 1695CHAPTER 209 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

• Increased risk of depression and anxiety, as well as a range of other psychiatric disorders.22,23 The signs and symptoms of PCOS may challenge a woman’s feminine identity and can affect her quality of life.24 Mood implications are clinically relevant because treating PCOS requires the patient to implement lifestyle changes and have the self-motivation to do so.25 • Increased risk of osteoporosis, due to the influence on bone metab- olism of the hormone imbalances found in PCOS.26

# CAUSES OF PCOS

PCOS is affected by many factors, but its precise pathophysiology has not yet been determined. PCOS is characterized by a combination of meta- bolic and endocrine abnormalities and reproductive dysfunction,5 most likely occurring as the result of both genetic and environmental factors, particularly obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diet.1,27 Overall, PCOS involves oxidative stress with systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and consequent hyperinsulinemia that all promote dysregulation of the ovarian thecal compartment and dysfunction of endothelial cells, resulting in hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and cardiovascular disorders.3,4,28 PCOS is more prevalent among women of certain ethnicities; for example, a higher prevalence has been noted among South Asian women compared with East Asian and Caucasian women.29,30 Ethnic variations in PCOS may be associated with environmental factors, such as socioeconomic conditions and lifestyle.31 Socioeconomic status may affect susceptibility to PCOS through association with adverse health behaviors and exposure to environmental toxins, leading to obesity and triggering hormonal reactions. Socioeconomic status might also partially explain geographical disparities in PCOS.32

## Androgen Excess/Hyperandrogenism

Ovarian androgen excess is the core of PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia enhances the activation of the thecal steroidogenesis and contrib- utes to impaired follicular maturation.1 Higher circulating andro- gen levels can hinder the normal growth of follicles, resulting in oligo-ovulation or anovulation, which mainly manifests an abnor- mal menstrual cycle (usually oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea). Elevated androgen levels also can cause hirsutism, acne, female hair loss, and other clinical symptoms. Androgen formation is also affected by insu- lin and the insulin growth factor system, the renin–angiotensin sys- tem (RAS), adiponectin, leptin, growth hormone, and other factors.5 Androgen can affect the growth and development of follicles, inhibit the formation of dominant follicles, and accumulate a large number of immature follicles, that is, encouraging the formation of the polycys- tic-like changes of the ovaries.5

<!-- chunk -->

## Insulin Resistance and Insulin Action Abnormalities

PCOS is associated with insulin resistance (IR), metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.33 IR can elevate serum insulin levels and increase the frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, causing elevated serum LH levels and further promoting excess androgen production. A large number of studies have confirmed that patients with PCOS have varying degrees of IR and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, including ovarian IR. IR and hyperinsulinemia play an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS,5 increasing hyperandro- genism and long-term metabolic, cardiovascular, and oncological risks.1

<!-- chunk -->

## Obesity

Obesity, especially abdominal obesity in adolescence and adulthood and weight gain in puberty, increases the risk of developing PCOS and increases the severity of certain PCOS features such as hyperandro- genism, hirsutism, infertility, psychological features, and pregnancy complications (e.g., preeclampsia and gestational diabetes).2 Obesity is seen in 35% to 60% of PCOS cases,34 and a 1-unit increase in body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of PCOS by 9%.35 Moreover, the obesity associated with insulin resistance increases the risk of cardio- vascular diseases and type 2 diabetes in PCOS. In many cases, obesity makes the hidden PCOS syndrome clinically apparent in susceptible women. Increases in visceral adipose tissue and central obesity have been observed even in lean women with PCOS compared with healthy women. The combination of obesity and disordered eating habits, which are both commonly associated with PCOS, further exacerbates reproductive, metabolic, and psychological morbidity.36,37 The increase in obesity-associated oxidative stress is probably due to the presence of excessive adipose tissue itself. Adipocytes and pread- ipocytes have been identified as a source of proinflammatory cytokines that are potent stimulators of the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.38,39 Abdominal obesity is seen in most patients with PCOS, especially in the viscera,40 and is strongly associated with the development of IR. Visceral adipose tissue is highly sensitive to lipolysis stimulated by androgens that will contribute to the increased availability of free fatty acids (FFAs). This, in turn, induces accumulation of hepatic fat and decreased hepatic insulin clearance and hepatic IR.5 There is an inter- action between the effects of PCOS and obesity, such that the metabolic abnormalities in women with PCOS are amplified to a greater degree by obesity than in weight-matched controls.41 Fat cells in women with PCOS appear to be metabolically different, having subcutaneous adipo- cytes that are larger and less responsive to the lipolytic effects of catechol- amines, with lower serum adiponectin production from adipocytes.42

<!-- chunk -->

## Oxidative Stress

The concentration levels of oxidative stress (OS) markers such as lipid peroxidation are higher than normal in PCOS. IR is thought to be a cause of OS, which can lead to the occurrence of hyperglycemia, causing related cells to release ROS. OS can damage cells and activate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn promotes the occurrence of IR and hyperandrogenism.5

## Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation

The role of inflammation in PCOS has been the subject of a number of studies, and direct correlations have been found between increased lev- els of inflammatory markers and the development of PCOS.43 PCOS is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation and predisposition to hemostatic and atherosclerotic complications.44 The inflammatory

## 1696SECTION 6 Diseases

responses are induced by hyperlipidemia and IR, which lead to the development of PCOS and are also involved in the formation of long- term complications. Some studies suggest that hyperandrogenism may induce chronic low-grade inflammation in PCOS, which in turn fur- ther promotes the occurrence of IR and hyperandrogenism. Chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with PCOS was found to be closely related to obesity and may be responsible for IR in nonobese patients with PCOS.5 However, circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- α ) are elevated even in the absence of obesity, indicating that PCOS is a proinflammatory state, regardless of obesity. Studies have shown a genetic basis for chronic low-grade inflammation in PCOS.39 Patients with PCOS were found to have significantly higher copper concentrations than patients without PCOS.45–47 Copper contributes to increased oxidative stress, leading to the generation of ROS, and it is possible that elevated copper levels play a role in the low-grade inflam- mation associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS.48

## Prenatal Androgen Exposure

The developmental origin of PCOS hypothesis suggests that the capac- ity to hypersecrete androgens begins in fetal life as a result of genetic and environmental interplay, and that the typical clinical and biochem- ical features of PCOS are “downstream” effects of exposure to andro- gen excess at or before puberty.1,18 Evidence from both clinical and preclinical studies supports the theory that high intrauterine andro- gen levels increase the susceptibility of female offspring to develop the PCOS phenotype after pubertal onset.49,50

<!-- chunk -->

## Neuroendocrinology Dysfunction of the Hypothalamic–

<!-- chunk -->

## Pituitary Axis

Studies have shown that neuroendocrine dysfunction plays an import- ant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS due to the complex inter- actions between abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis, hyperinsulinemia, and endocrine dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis.5 Elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency is suggestive of a hyperactive HPG axis due to impaired negative gonadal hormone feedback. GnRH is increased in response to LH, leading to an increase in the LH/FSH ratio, which causes a decrease in aromatase activity in granulosa cells, resulting in testosterone not aromatizing into estrogen. Androgens in women with PCOS alter central brain circuits, suppressing the negative-feedback effect of progesterone on GnRH production.5,51

<!-- chunk -->

## Adrenal Dysfunction

In women with PCOS, 20% to 30% have excess adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). The adrenal andro- gens have feedback effects on increasing the hypothalamic secretion of LH, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the synthesis of ovarian androgens.5,52

<!-- chunk -->

## Ovarian Dysfunction

The World Health Organization classifies PCOS as a group II ovu- lation disorder, which are dysfunctions of the HPA–ovarian axis.53 PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. There may be genetic morphological changes, but ovulation or anovulation is mainly dependent on the follicular environment. In PCOS, disor- dered follicular development affects oocyte development. Ovarian hyperandrogenism, mainly due to thecal cells that are overrespon- sive to LH, can lead to excessive follicular atresia, follicular stasis, and anovulation.


Studies have found significantly higher serum levels of environ- mental toxins, such as perfluorinated compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BPA), pesticides, and polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbons, among women with PCOS compared with con- trol subjects. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are defined as “substances in our environment, food, and consumer products that interfere with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, or action result- ing in a deviation from normal homeostatic control or reproduc- tion.”54 EDCs are a broad class of molecules that include plasticizers such as phthalates and BPA, as well as advanced glycation end prod- ucts (AGEs).55 BPA is the most characteristic agent, and it is found in the everyday domestic environment and food chain. These nat- ural or synthetic products mimic natural hormones and/or disrupt their action. Both experimental and epidemiological evidence support the role of EDC exposure in the physiopathology of PCOS, either through in utero exposure via the mother or through chronic adult expo- sure interfering with follicular maturation, ovarian steroidogenesis, and/or occurrence of insulin resistance.56 In addition, EDCs play a role in obesity and type 2 diabetes through an in utero fetal effect. Low concentrations of BPA exposure (as are found in the human population) are able to induce IR. The timing of EDC exposure is crucial for the intensity of adverse health effects, with fetuses, infants, and/or young children being the most susceptible groups, especially in the early development periods. These exposure effects may be expressed across generations.57 BPA levels are higher in women with PCOS than in those without PCOS, and they correlate positively with total or free testosterone and IR. Hyperandrogenism can slow down the metabolism of BPA in the liver, and BPA can interfere with hyperandrogenism at various levels—circulating sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), androgen receptor, synthesis via steroidogenic enzymes, and androgen metabolism—leading to a vicious cycle.1,32,58

## Genetic Determinants

The origin of hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia has a genetic component, as demonstrated by familial aggregation studies and recent identification of associated genomic variants.1 To date, more than 100 candidate genes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PCOS, with particular focus on genes affecting the biosynthesis and function of reproductive hormones, metabolism of insulin, folliculo- genesis, cellular metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and chronic inflammation.12,27,59 Screening for PCOS susceptibility genes has also found variants corresponding to genes involved in the regulation of fat mass.60 The protective or susceptible genomic variants involved may be influenced by environmental factors through epigenetic mod- ifications (e.g., DNA methylation, histone state, microRNA [miRNA] expression). Several differences have been found in PCOS in some miRNAs involved in the control of genes necessary for androgen synthesis, inflammation, adipogenesis, and signaling. Two miRNAs appear to be of particular interest as biomarkers in PCOS: miR-222 positively correlates with insulin, and miR-146a negatively correlates with testosterone.1 Environmental conditions may mimic hormonal actions and activate preexisting predisposing factors, triggering the characteristic endocrine alterations of PCOS. These can be prenatal (epigenetic fetal programming) or postnatal (diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and envi- ronmental toxins).27

## Attenuated Apoptosis

The majority of human follicles do not reach a stage of final matura- tion but face elimination by atresia. The process of follicle apoptosis is tightly regulated and influenced by endocrine, paracrine, and auto- crine factors.61 The increased number of viable primary and secondary follicles in the polycystic ovary indicates that the process of apoptosis is attenuated.62

# DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS

No single test is used to diagnose PCOS, and diagnosis criteria vary to some degree according to the consensus group. There are three differ- ent diagnostic criteria systems (Table 209.1). Table 209.2 outlines key diagnostics to assess possible underlying causes.

<!-- chunk -->

## Signs and Symptoms

Women with PCOS demonstrate marked clinical heterogeneity in their symptoms. The wide range of commonly associated features of PCOS are neither uniform nor universal, and they usually worsen with time.18,63 There are widely ranging signs and symptoms associ- ated with PCOS, which can vary over time in individual women, usu- ally worsening with time. Women might experience many or some of the signs and symptoms; the condition will affect each woman differently.

<!-- chunk -->

## Classification of Features

• Clinical: including menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism, acne, alo- pecia, anovulatory infertility, and recurrent miscarriages • Endocrine: including elevated androgens, LH, estrogen, and pro- lactin • Metabolic: including insulin resistance, obesity, lipid abnormali- ties, and an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus12

<!-- chunk -->

## Hyperandrogenism

Hyperandrogenism is the most constant and prominent component of PCOS, but reliable detection of this feature is not straightforward, and indices vary considerably depending on age, body weight, and ethnic origin.6 Hyperandrogenism is assessed by clinical features, biochemical indices, or both. Clinically, hyperandrogenism is diag- nosed by the most subjective assessment of cutaneous manifestations of excessive androgen activity, such as hirsutism, acne (especially in young women), and female-pattern baldness (especially in older women).6

<!-- chunk -->

## Anovulation

PCOS is present in around 70% of women who have issues with ovulation, leading to infertility.64 The major clinical signs of chronic anovulation are oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Amenorrhea results from a failure of the HPG axis.65 The failure of underdeveloped fol- licles to mature causes menses to be erratic or absent, and the lack of cyclical control in relation to normal mechanisms of feedback between the ovary and pituitary gland can lead to reduced fertility.66 Women experiencing oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea as a result of PCOS are at increased risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia and endome- trial cancer, although there is no increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer.29

<!-- chunk -->

## Hyperinsulinemia

IR is present in 60% to 80% of women with PCOS and in 95% of obese women with PCOS. IR causes LH stimulation of the internal theca LH receptor, which increases hyperandrogenemia and disrupts follicular maturation. Hyperinsulinemia also increases circulating hyperandrogenemia via the decrease of SHBG. Whatever its ori- gin, IR is a mechanism through which environmental factors such as nutrition, energy balance, intestinal microbiota, and chemical pollutants are able to influence the course of PCOS. IR causes an increase in inflammatory markers, which cause endothelial damage, increased vessel wall reactivity to pressure substances, and the devel- opment of atherosclerosis, suggesting an increased risk of cardiovas- cular disease.1,34

<!-- chunk -->

## Hirsutism, Acne, Seborrhea, and Alopecia

Acne, hirsutism, and androgenic alopecia are due to androgenic stim- ulation of the pilosebaceous unit.2 Androgen excess contributes to a dysregulation of hair follicle growth, increasing hair follicle size, hair fiber diameter, and the proportion of time terminal hairs remain in the growth phase.5 Hirsutism can affect approximately 5% to 10% of reproductive-age women, whereas approximately 80% of hirsute patients will have PCOS. Hirsutism is the clinical feature that has the strongest impact on health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) scores in women with PCOS.67 A Cochrane review found that the treatment of hirsutism needs to incorporate pharmaceutical therapies, cosmetic procedures, and psychological support.68 If the sebaceous glands are sensitive to the effects of androgens, they produce excess oil, which can result in the buildup of dead skin cells lining the pores of the skin. When these cells are not adequately shed, they clog the pores and can produce comedones. Alopecia (male-pat- tern hair loss) is associated with hyperandrogenism.69

## Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Obstructive sleep apnea appears to be present in a disproportionate number of women with PCOS and may be associated with distinct endocrine and metabolic alterations.70

<!-- chunk -->

## Recognized Phenotypes in PCOS

The phenotypes in PCOS can be broadly classified into four types as per Table 209.3. Metabolically, phenotypes A and B (“classic PCOS”) behave similarly, with approximately 75% to 85% demonstrating insulin resistance and some form of metabolic dysfunction.71 The different phenotypes vary in the degree to which they are associated with an increased risk for metabolic dysfunction and reproductive complications.


Treatment often focuses on individual symptoms rather than treat- ment of the syndrome itself because the underlying pathophysiology of PCOS is not fully understood.72 There is no medication available that completely reverses the underlying hormonal imbalance and treats all of the associated clinical symptoms of PCOS.11 Current recommenda- tions focus on controlling weight, hormone balance and insulin resis- tance via lifestyle modification (e.g., diet, exercise, and weight loss), and insulin-sensitizing agents, which are the more effective manage- ment strategies.5

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Considerations

It is generally accepted that changes in diet can produce a profound and beneficial effect with regard to symptomatology and coexisting conditions (e.g., subfertility or amenorrhea). The optimal diet for individuals with PCOS is recognized as not just being one that reduces symptomatology and assists with weight management but also one that protects against the associated pathologies of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, impaired fertility, and certain cancers.

## 1699CHAPTER 209 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

Dieting, alone or in combination with exercise, has been shown to be the most effective way to improve metabolic disturbances in obese women with PCOS. In one study, increased fiber and reduced trans fat intake were the primary predictors of weight loss and metabolic improvement.73 A study on the effects of dietary carbohydrates in PCOS concluded that it is energy restriction and weight loss in PCOS that improve ovulation rates, conception hyperandrogenemia, glucose and insulin levels, insulin resistance, and satiety hormones. The composition of the diet is less important, so long as the weight loss is achieved.74 There is limited research in this area in PCOS; however, a system- atic review of existing studies including low-glycemic-index (GI) diets concluded no clear benefit of any specific macronutrient composition, and general healthy diets with reduced energy intake were recom- mended.75 There is currently a lot of interest in the role of different types of fasting regimes, which can IR and could consequently have beneficial effects on ovarian function, androgen excess, and infertility in women with PCOS.76 Glucose and saturated fatty acids are proinflammatory and lead to dyslipidemia independent from IR and obesity in PCOS.39 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may facilitate the resolution of inflammation and perhaps confer a protective effect, and alterations in dietary intake of macronutrients may mitigate the low-grade chronic inflammation associated with these disorders and improve fertility. For example, low-GI diets are associated with lower serum concentra- tions of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and dietary consumption of trans fat is associated with IR and a proinflam- matory state. Replacing animal protein with protein from vegetable sources was associated with a lower risk of ovulatory infertility.77 Strong adherence to the healthy dietary pattern (fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole grains) was inversely associated with the hyperandro- genic PCOS phenotype only. The adherence to the unhealthy dietary pattern, however, was not associated with the hyperandrogenic or non- hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotype. Moreover, hyperandrogenic and nonhyperandrogenic patients with PCOS with strong adherence to a healthy dietary pattern also demonstrated a threefold-higher chance of ongoing pregnancy.9 An 8-week dietary intervention trial of 24 women with PCOS showed that a low-starch/low-dairy diet improved weight parameters, inulin sensitivity, testosterone levels, and hirsutism. The diet included lean animal protein (meat and poultry), fish and shellfish, eggs, non- starchy vegetables, low-sugar fruits (berries, apples, oranges, plums, etc.), avocado, olives, nuts and seeds, and oils (olive and coconut) and excluded grains, beans, dairy products (other than 30 g full-fat cheese per day to assist with compliance), and sugar (including fruit juice from concentrate, raw turbinado sugar, evaporated cane juice, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, or agave nectar) because of their insulinemic properties.78

## Low-GI Diet

High carbohydrate intake is often identified as an exacerbating factor for PCOS, although diet itself is not likely a cause of PCOS.32 The GI is a classification index of carbohydrate foods based on postprandial glu- cose response (i.e., it ranks carbohydrate-rich foods in terms of their potential to increase blood glucose levels). Given that insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are key features of PCOS, follow- ing a low-GI diet is highly recommended.79 In PCOS, a high-GI diet is associated with a less favorable anthropometric and metabolic profile.9 A 12-week high-protein, low-glycemic-load hypocaloric diet (30% of daily energy from protein plus low-glycemic-load foods) resulted in weight loss, reduced androgen levels, increased insulin sensitivity, and decreased inflammatory markers in overweight and obese women with PCOS (n = 60).80 Another small study showed that a 12-week isocaloric low-GI diet (participants maintained their usual energy and macronutrient intake) improved measures of insulin sensitivity and nonesterified fatty acid in 21 women with PCOS.81

## Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet reduces weight and improves the lipid profile in patients with PCOS, and it reduces serum insulin.82 A study randomly assigned women with PCOS (n = 60) to a control diet or the DASH diet. Both diets consisted of 50% to 55% carbohydrate, 15% to 20% protein, and 25% to 30% total fat, but the DASH diet was high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. After 3 months, the DASH diet was associ- ated with significant weight loss and a significant reduction in serum androstenedione, with an increase in antioxidant status and SHBG.83

## Mediterranean Diet

A Mediterranean-inspired low-GI anti-inflammatory diet based on consumption of legumes, fish, and low-fat dairy products in a Mediterranean context resulted in significant improvements in body composition, hormones and menstrual cycle regulation, blood pres- sure, glucose homeostasis, dyslipidemia, CRP, serum amyloid A (surro- gate measures of cardiovascular risk), and weight loss that is associated with improved fertility outcomes in overweight or obese women with PCOS (n = 100). The 12-week study involved reduced-energy, low-fat, low-saturated-fat, and moderate-to-high-fiber diets (25% proteins, 25% fat, and 50% carbohydrates) and was combined with physical exercise. Of the women in the study, 63% regained menstrual cyclicity, and there was a 12% spontaneous pregnancy rate within the 12 weeks.84

## Dietary Exclusions

<!-- chunk -->

## Advanced Glycation End-Products. Advanced glycation end-

products (AGEs) are proinflammatory molecules that trigger a state of intracellular oxidative stress and inflammation after binding to their cell membrane receptors (RAGE). Women with PCOS have elevated serum AGEs and an upregulation of RAGE in their ovaries, indicating systemic chronic inflammation at the ovarian level. High AGEs may represent a risk factor for ovulatory dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease85 and may contribute to the etiology of PCOS and infertility. AGEs accumulate in the ovaries of women with PCOS, potentially contributing to the well-documented abnormal steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis.86 AGEs can be formed either endogenously or exogenously. Endogenously, advanced glycation takes place in all cell types via the Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino resi- dues present in proteins, lipids, and DNA, resulting in loss of pro- tein structure and function followed in some instances by cellular apoptosis. Exogenous AGEs can be introduced into the circulation together with nutrients processed by common methods such as dry heat or other food-processing methods, for example, ionization. About 10% of AGEs contained in a meal could be absorbed into the circulation, of which two thirds remain in the body for 72 hours, long enough to promote oxidative stress and cause tissue injury.85 Another exogenous source of AGEs is smoking. Both the aqueous extracts of tobacco and cigarette smoke contain glycotoxins—highly reactive glycation products that can rapidly induce AGE formation on proteins. Smoking has been shown to worsen the already elevated risk for metabolic syndrome in women with PCOS.85 Animal-derived foods are the major source of AGEs, and diets containing high protein and fat have higher amounts of AGEs in comparison to a carbohydrate-rich diet. Cooking methods also

<!-- chunk -->

## 1700SECTION 6 Diseases

affect dietary AGE content—food prepared at low temperatures with high moisture and brief heating times have less AGEs. The use of acidic marinades such as lemon juice and vinegar during cooking significantly reduces the AGE content in the diet. The highest level of AGEs per gram of food is present in dry-heat-processed foods (e.g., chips, crackers, and cookies) due to the presence of oil, but- ter, cheese, nuts, and eggs as ingredients in these foods. Dry-heat processing also accelerates dietary AGE formation in lean red meats and poultry due to the presence of reactive amino-lipids and reduc- ing sugars (fructose as well as glucose-6-phosphate). Fruits, vegeta- bles, low-fat milk, grains, and legumes have the lowest dietary AGE content.87–89 Almost two thirds of women with PCOS are predisposed to devel- oping IR and, ultimately, diabetes, both of which are typically exacer- bated by obesity. AGEs have been implicated in the development of IR in PCOS.85 Diet-induced elevation of AGE levels and the corresponding increased oxidative stress may directly induce insulin-signaling defects, leading to the development of IR in PCOS. Increased AGEs are also associated with obesity in PCOS.85–89 Changes in dietary AGEs parallel changes in insulin sensitivity, oxi- dative stress, and hormonal status in women with PCOS, and there- fore lowering the concentration of AGEs in food may improve these variables.85

<!-- chunk -->

## Caffeine. Women with PCOS need to keep their caffeine intake

to a minimum because caffeine affects ovulation and corpus luteum function through changing hormone levels.90 This is especially relevant to women with PCOS hoping to conceive; most studies have shown that caffeine intake is a risk factor for impaired fertility.91,92

<!-- chunk -->

## Saturated Fats and Deep-Fried Foods. Women with PCOS are at

risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease and need to keep saturated fat and deep-fried foods to a minimum. These foods have been linked directly to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Typically, these foods are inflammatory, higher in AGEs, and also deficient in nutrients.

<!-- chunk -->

## Sugar. Sugar in all its forms needs to be minimized in the

patient with PCOS. Sugar contributes to elevated blood sugar and inflammation, contributing to symptomatology. Sugar-containing foods include fruit, which should be kept to a maximum of two pieces daily. The fruit chosen should be low GI (i.e., a cup of berries instead of a cup of pineapple). If sugar is consumed, a protein component should also be included to ensure stable blood sugar levels.

<!-- chunk -->

## Refined Carbohydrates. Like sugar, refined carbohydrates such

as white bread, candies, and pasta (which are ultimately broken down to sugar) aggravate PCOS by causing elevated levels of glucose, insulin, and inflammation. A high-GI diet (i.e., one high in refined carbohydrates and sugars) has been found to worsen postprandial insulin resistance.93


<!-- chunk -->

## Antioxidants

PCOS is associated with oxidative stress in which increased pro- duction of free radicals is followed by decreased serum total anti- oxidant levels. Free-radical levels have been shown to be elevated in PCOS, resulting in a reduction in nitric oxide (NO) availability, which could play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS via its effect on insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a thiol-containing antioxidant that has multiple actions, including increasing intracellular glutathione levels, lowering inflammatory markers, and increasing insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS.94,95 A small 6-month preliminary study (n = 8) showed that treatment with a combination of NAC (1200 mg/day) combined with l-argi- nine (1600 mg/day) showed a potential to restore gonadal function and improve insulin sensitivity in women PCOS.96 In women with PCOS undergoing IVF treatment (n = 60), 6-week supplementa- tion with NAC (1800 mg/day) has been shown to ameliorate oocyte and embryo quality, representing an alternative to metformin pre- scription. In this study, the treatment group was compared with a group receiving metformin only (1500 mg/day), a group receiving metformin and NAC (at the same doses), and a placebo group.97 Studies using NAC as adjuvant therapy to clomiphene citrate showed improved ovulation and pregnancy rates, with no adverse effects or ovarian hyperstimulation.98,99 In PCOS, serum total antioxidant status, which combines the con- centrations of individual antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, β -car- otene, and thiol groups, is decreased.94 Sources of oxidative stress in PCOS include the following: • Adipose tissue—adipocytes and preadipocytes have been identified as a source of proinflammatory cytokines that are potent stimula- tors of the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. • Fatty acid oxidation • Hyperglycemia—induces overproduction of ROS • NO—endothelial NO release is impaired in insulin-resistant states such as PCOS. • Mitochondrial dysfunction—mitochondria are the site where the largest amounts of ROS are generated. It has been shown that even lean women with PCOS exhibit increased oxidative stress.100,101 A recent Cochrane review found that in women with PCOS, anti- oxidant treatment is associated with an increased live birth rate com- pared with placebo or no treatment.102

## B Vitamins (Especially Folate and Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 12


Thiamine (B1), via its role in the enzyme system thiamine pyrophos- phate, is required for almost every cellular reaction in the body; hence, any deficiency will affect the whole body. Thiamine plays a key role in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats103; thus, it may be useful to improve insulin sensitivity. Patients with a history of oral contra- ceptive use are at risk of thiamine deficiency, so supplementation may be required to restore levels. Increased glucose metabolism results in increased requirements of thiamine.104 Thiamine deficiency also leads to impaired glucose tolerance. Riboflavin (B 2 ) also plays a key role in metabolism via its role in the flavin adenine dinucleotide/flavin mononucleotide system, which is required for normal carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B 3 is required for a multitude of functions within the body and has been used success- fully to treat symptoms synonymous with PCOS, including elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipopro- tein (a). Vitamin B 5 is required for the breakdown of fats and carbohy- drates via its function in coenzyme A. Pyridoxine (B 6 ) has been shown to reduce elevated homocysteine associated with metformin therapy105 and additionally is recommended to stabilize hormone cascades. The one-carbon (1-C) pathway plays an essential role in epigenetics, in which methyl groups derived from nutrients such as B vitamins are used for DNA synthesis and phospholipid and protein biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that dietary patterns rich in these B vita- mins are associated with increased chances of pregnancy and decreased chances of adverse pregnancy outcome, confirming the involvement of the 1-C pathway.9 All the B vitamins are essential for healthy function because they are required as a cofactor in numerous enzyme pathways, for meta- bolic functions as well as for energy production. They are especially

important to assist with the breakdown of carbohydrates to energy, to help support the stress response, and to reduce elevated homocysteine levels in women with PCOS taking metformin.105 Supplementation with folic acid has been shown to reduce ele- vated levels of homocysteine in patients with PCOS.106 Homocysteine levels are significantly elevated in women with PCOS. Levels are par- ticularly elevated in women with PCOS with insulin resistance, and to a lesser degree in women without insulin resistance.107 Because homocysteine is a marker for cardiovascular disease, homocysteine should be screened for in all patients with PCOS. Supplementation with 5 mg folate/day for 8 weeks in overweight or obese women with PCOS reduced plasma homocysteine, intervention to quantify glucose metabolism and lipid concentrations. Folate supplementation (5 mg), compared with folate (1 mg) and placebo, resulted in reduced plasma homocysteine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score, and serum CRP levels compared with placebo and treatment with 1 mg folate/day. There was also an increase in total antioxidant capacity and glutathione levels and a beneficial effect on lipid profiles.108 In contract, a meta-analysis on the effect of folate sup- plementation on lipid profiles in metabolic disease found no effect on blood pressure or lipid profiles.109 Vitamin B 12 (2000 microgram/day) has been shown to reduce ele- vated homocysteine associated with metformin therapy.105

## Chromium

Chromium is an essential element in glucose and insulin homeosta- sis. Several studies have investigated the effect of chromium supple- mentation in PCOS, with varying results. An earlier study found that chromium picolinate (1000 μ g/day for 2 months) improved glucose dis- posal in 5 women with PCOS.110 A more recent 6-month randomized controlled trial of 85 women showed that supplementation with μ g of chromium picolinate daily (in 5 divided doses of μ g each) resulted in a significant reduction in BMI and fasting serum insulin. After 5 months, menstrual cycles were more regulated, and there was an increased chance of ovulation in the intervention group.111 Another 6-month study of chromium picolinate supplementation (1000 μ g/day) found that supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in mean ovarian volume, total follicular count, and free testosterone in 35 ado- lescent girls with PCOS.112 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled trial of 60 women with PCOS showed that supplementation with 200 μ g chromium picolinate per day for 8 weeks had beneficial effects on acne, hirsutism, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared with placebo. Supplementation did not affect endocrine profiles, nitric oxide, or glutathione levels.113 A meta-analysis of the literature to date concluded that chromium picolinate supplementation has a significant effect on fasting insulin, free testosterone, and BMI in patients with PCOS.114 In a study comparing chromium picolinate supplementation (200 μ g/day) to metformin (1500 mg/day) over 3 months in women with clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS (n = 92), it was found that the chromium supplementation improved glucose and insulin parameters, with effects comparable to those of metformin. However, metformin treatment decreased hyperandrogenism, unlike chromium picolinate. Chromium picolinate was better tolerated than metformin.115

## Essential Fatty Acids

Essential fatty acids have shown improved insulin sensitivity and anti-inflammatory properties. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been linked to PCOS, but supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to have a beneficial effect on liver fat content and other cardiovascular risk factors in women with PCOS. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (4 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of 4 × 1000 mg capsules of 56% docosapentaenoic acid [DPA] and 27% eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) has been shown to decrease liver fat, tri- glycerides, and blood pressure in women with PCOS over an 8-week period.116 Studies have produced mixed results, however, with regard to EFAs and reproductive or metabolic abnormalities in PCOS.117 A study found that PUFAs modulated hormonal and lipid profiles, and supplementation with long-chain omega-3 PUFAs improved andro- genic profiles by reducing plasma bioavailable testosterone concen- trations in women with PCOS.118 However, a 2016 meta-analysis of the antiadrenergic effect of EFAs in PCOS concluded that the results of omega-3 PUFA supplementation studies are inconsistent, and sup- plementation does not significantly affect the adrenergic profile of women with PCOS. Some studies did show reduced DHEAS levels after supplementation. There is evidence that omega-2 PUFA supplementation provides beneficial effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors in PCOS, includ- ing insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and obesity. In a 6-month study of 88 women with PCOS, omega-3 PUFA supplemen- tation (360 mg EPA and 240 mg DHA per day) was found to improve lipid profile and waist circumference compared with placebo, but there were no changes in hormonal profile.119 There is some incon- sistent evidence that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may elevate fasting blood glucose concentration.120 A study in 61 women with PCOS found that supplementation with 4 g EFA (equating to mg EPA and 480 mg DHA) per day for 8 weeks resulted in improved insulin sensitivity.121 However, a 2017 meta-analysis into the effect of omega-3 supplementation on insulin resistance in PCOS concluded that there was no significant effect of omega-3 supplementation com- pared with placebo.122 Two recent studies looked at the combined effect of omega-3 and vitamin E supplementation in PCOS. One study found that omega-3 (1000 mg, EPA/DHA ratio not given) and vitamin E (400 IU) per day for 12 weeks improved parameters of mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress) and some parameters of insulin and inflammation (downregulation of PPAR- γ , interleukin [IL]-8, and TNF- α ) but had no effect on GLUT-1, IL-6 and TGF- β .123 Similarly, supplementation with 100 mg flaxseed oil (containing 400 mg α -lipoic acid) combined with 400 IU vitamin E for 12 weeks, resulted in improvements in gene expression of lipoproteins, lipid profiles, and markers of oxidative stress in 68 women with PCOS tak- ing metformin.124 Two trials have found a significant effect for total cholesterol in women with PCOS receiving omega-3 fish oils compared with placebo controls. No evidence of an effect was found for free testosterone or SHBG, waist-to-hip ratio, or inflammation.122,125 Findings were mixed for some secondary outcomes, including triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL, BMI, fasting glucose, and insulin resis- tance. One trial received treatment of 3.5 g (EPA 258 mg and DHA mg) for 6 weeks,126 which was less than the other trial, where women received 4 g (EPA 720 mg and DHA 480 mg) over 8 weeks. Significant effects were found for morbidly obese women taking the higher dose of fish oils for fasting glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and reduced LDLs.125 A small trial of 1500-mg omega-3 supplementation per day for months showed beneficial effects on hirsutism and insulin resistance in nonobese women with PCOS. Serum LH and testosterone levels decreased, and SHBG levels increased significantly in the trial.127 Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation from flaxseed oil (2000 mg/ day for 12 weeks) resulted in significantly improved gene expression related to insulin and lipid metabolism in women with PCOS (n = 60). Beneficial effects were seen in insulin metabolism, hirsutism, serum triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and hs-CRP levels.128–130

Magnesium, one of the abundant cations in the human body, partic- ipates in enzymatic reactions and insulin secretion, and reduced lev- els have been reported in women with high levels of testosterone or insulin resistance, such as diabetes mellitus type 2 and other metabolic diseases.45,131 In PCOS, low serum and body magnesium levels have been found, irrespective of steroid hormone concentrations, compared with that of controls.132 In contrast to this, an observational study of 1137 women found no significant differences in the levels of serum magnesium between PCOS and non-PCOS women.45 Given the evi- dence, magnesium replacement seems to be effective in the adjustment and improvement of insulin resistance and should be considered in managing PCOS.

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid

Alpha-lipoic acid is a powerful antioxidant that has been shown to improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity,133 indicating a bene- ficial role for it in PCOS. A 4-month study of lean, nondiabetic women with PCOS found that daily supplementation with alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg twice daily) improved insulin sensitivity by 13.5% and low- ered triglycerides.134 An increase in the number of menstrual cycles was observed in patients who were not taking the oral contraceptive pill.


Oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS by contributing to ovarian mesenchymal hyperplasia. Vitamin E via its antioxidant properties has been observed in experimental studies to inhibit these free pro-oxidant constituents, counteracting this growth and highlighting the protective role of vitamin E in PCOS.135


Zinc contributes to the progress of insulin phosphorylation by increas- ing antioxidant capacity, which affects insulin synthesis and secre- tion.136 In one study, zinc supplementation (30 mg/day for 1 month) in obese individuals with insulin resistance showed improvements in insu- lin sensitivity,137 and a higher intake of zinc has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.138 There are conflicting data on serum zinc levels in women with PCOS. Some studies have found that levels are significantly lower in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS,136,139 whereas other studies have found no significant difference in levels.45,47 An observational study of 1137 women found no significant differences in the levels of serum zinc between the two groups, and one study found that zinc levels were significantly higher in those with PCOS.140 Despite this uncertainty, a clinical trial has shown benefits from zinc supplementation in PCOS. In the randomized, dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 52 women with PCOS, supple- mentation with 220 mg zinc sulfate (50 mg elemental zinc) per day over 8 weeks resulted in beneficial effects on metabolic profiles compared with placebo. The women in the treatment group had reduced fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels and improved insulin resis- tance parameters. Secondary outcomes in the treatment group included significant reductions in serum triglyceride levels and VLDL cholesterol concentrations.141 Given zinc’s role in insulin sensitivity, it is likely to be of benefit in managing PCOS. Zinc supplementation may also be useful for managing concurrent PCOS symptoms, such as acne.


Vitamin D plays important roles in metabolic pathways affected by PCOS, including calcium homeostasis, the insulin pathway, and sex hormone synthesis. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed throughout the female reproductive tract. VDR polymorphisms (particularly TaqI and Cdx2) are associated with the severity of disease presentation (but not to the same extent as serum vitamin D levels), but not with increased risk of PCOS.142–144 There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation might be beneficial in PCOS for improving follicular development and regulation of the menstrual cycle; however, the results are inconclu- sive, and further rigorous trials are needed.145 In women with PCOS who were vitamin D deficient, 50,000 IU vitamin supplementation once weekly over 8 weeks was found to significantly decrease serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with placebo, which is another beneficial mechanism for improving PCOS outcomes by reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).146 A systematic review of the data found that vitamin D supplemen- tation significantly reduced total testosterone levels in women with PCOS; however, no effect was found on serum free testosterone or SHBG levels.147 One study showed that 8 weeks of vitamin D 3 supplementation increased circulating soluble receptors for AGEs, which bind circulat- ing AGEs and reduce the inflammatory response, exerting a protective effect in PCOS.148 Vitamin D deficiency is common in women with PCOS; some esti- mates indicate that 70% to 85% of women with PCOS may be vitamin D deficient, which may contribute to insulin resistance, ovulatory and menstrual irregularities, lower pregnancy success, hirsutism, hyper- androgenism, obesity, and elevated cardiovascular disease risk fac- tors.117,149 A meta-analysis found that vitamin D deficiency was more common in obese patients with PCOS than in nonobese women with PCOS, concluding that the risk of vitamin D deficiency is associated with comorbidities of PCOS and not with PCOS per se.150 Vitamin D deficiency may play a role in exacerbating PCOS, indicating a role for supplementation in the management of the condition. Higher vita- min D levels are associated with an increased likelihood of successful pregnancy and may be of particular benefit to women with PCOS in lowering hyperandrogenism.149 Regardless of deficiency, women with PCOS have been found to have markedly lower vitamin D levels than healthy control patients.151 In a study of 60 women with PCOS, divided into three groups by vita- min D status, insulin resistance was greatest in the patients with the most severe vitamin D deficiency.152 Studies have found that 8 weeks of supplementation with vitamin D (50,000 IU/day) and calcium (1000 mg/day) together had benefi- cial effects on inflammatory markers, total antioxidant capacity, serum insulin levels, insulin resistance markers, insulin sensitivity markers, triglyceride levels, and VLDL-cholesterol levels in overweight vitamin D–deficient women with PCOS. The results were significantly greater than treatment with either vitamin D or calcium alone.153,154 In infertile women with PCOS who were vitamin D deficient (n = 100), it was found that treatment with metformin (1500 mg/day) combined with calcium (1000 mg/day) and vitamin D (100,000 IU per month) supplementation over 6 months resulted in improvements in follicle maturation, menstrual regularity, and hyperandrogenism in the treatment group compared with metformin alone.155 In another study, the effects of supplementation with vitamin D (200 IU), calcium (500 mg), and vitamin K (90 μ g) together, twice a day for 8 weeks, resulted in a significant reduction in serum free testos- terone and DHEAS levels in women with PCOS who were vitamin D deficient (n = 60). There was also a significant increase in total antiox- idant capacity and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the treatment group compared with placebo.156 A randomized trial in infertile women with PCOS undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ISCI) treatment (n = 105) found that supplementation with vitamin E (400 mg/day) and vitamin D 3

(50,000 IU fortnightly) over 8 weeks resulted in significant increases in pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, and implantation rates compared with placebo. The study concluded that this result was not due to improved antioxidant status, but the mechanistic pathway was unknown.157 Low levels of 25(OH) vitamin D have been associated with increased levels of autoimmune thyroid disease in PCOS.158 Although the research is not conclusive regarding the role of vitamin D in PCOS, at a minimum, identifying and correcting vitamin D deficiency is recommended.

## Inositol

Inositol, particularly the myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (CDI) isomers, is a mediator of insulin action. In the liver, MI pro- motes glucose uptake, and DCI promotes glycogen synthesis. In repro- ductive tissue such as the ovary, MI regulates glucose uptake and FSH signaling, whereas DCI is devoted to the insulin-mediated androgen production.159 MI belongs to the vitamin B complex (it is also known as vitamin B 8 ) and is found in various foods. The highest concentrations are found in fresh fruits and vegetables, beans, grains (particularly oats and bran), nuts (particularly almonds, walnuts, and brazil nuts), and seeds.160 MI can also be produced endogenously from glucose. There is some evidence to suggest that MI may help to regulate hormones (LH surge), menstrual cycles, ovulation, androgen levels, and hirsutism in women with PCOS via improved insulin resistance,117,161 whereas DCI seems to have a positive effect on hyperandrogenism, although studies in DCI have produced mixed results. Inositols are thought to be ther- apeutic for PCOS because they act as an insulin-sensitizing agent and free-radical scavenger, helping to regulate metabolism and promote ovulation.159 A 2016 systematic review concluded that MI provided a positive effect on the reproductive axis in PCOS, by improving insulin sensitivity, restoring ovulation, improving oocyte quality, and reduc- ing hyperandrogenism.162 However, according to a 2017 meta-analysis of the literature, MI supplementation is not able to improve the oocyte or embryo quality and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS who are undergoing ICSI treatment.163 A 40:1 ratio of MI:DCI is recommended to improve ovulation and embryo quality.161 Supplementation of MI alone (2–4 g/d) is optimal to reduce clinical hyperandrogenism and dyslipidemia through the reduction of insulin plasma levels, with few side effects.164 A recent 120-week trial conducted on 60 women with PCOS found that supplementation with MI (2 g twice per day with μ g folic acid) was more effective in the reduction of testosterone, hirsutism, serum hs-CPR levels, and gene expression of IL-1 compared with metformin (500 mg three times daily). No difference was found in other hormonal profiles between the two treatment groups.165

## Selenium

Selenium regulates the inflammatory response, proliferation, and dif- ferentiation of several immune cells. Moreover, serum selenium levels are related to a decrease in ROS production; therefore, selenium seems to have a protective role against disorders associated with oxidative stress.48 Selenium levels have been observed to be lower in women with PCOS compared with healthy women, and a negative correlation between testosterone level and serum selenium has been reported.166 In an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consist- ing of 64 women with PCOS, women were assigned to either the inter- vention group (n = 32), which received μ g selenium daily, or the control group (n = 32), which received a placebo. The results showed that the pregnancy rate was higher in the intervention group, and alopecia and acne were decreased compared with the control group. The selenium group also showed decreased DHEA and CRP levels and decreased hirsutism.167 Recently, two interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies aimed to investigate the effect of selenium supplementation on glucose homeostasis parameters in patients with PCOS. After 8 weeks of selenium supplementation (200 μ g/day), a significant decrease in serum insulin levels was observed in the treatment group compared with placebo.168 However, a second 12-week trial with the same dose of selenium did not confirm any ben- eficial effect of selenium supplementation in patients with PCOS. On the contrary, it resulted in worsening of insulin resistance.169 Further studies are needed to clarify these contradictory results.

## Carnitine

Carnitine plays a substantial role in weight loss, glucose tolerance, insulin function, and fatty-acid metabolism. Potential mechanisms of action include increasing mitochondrial efflux of excess acyl groups from insulin-responsive tissues and facilitating transportation of the long-chain free fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix.170 Some studies have reported that circulating levels of free and total l-carni- tine were significantly lower in women with PCOS.171,172 In a recent prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of overweight women with PCOS, supplementation with carnitine (250 mg/day) for 12 weeks resulted in reductions in weight, BMI, and waist and hip circumference. There were also significant reductions in fast- ing plasma glucose, serum insulin levels, and HOMA-IR compared with placebo. All participants in the study were taking metformin (500 mg initially, stepped up to 1500 mg/day after 3 weeks). There were no changes to the normal diet and physical activity levels of the partici- pants during the study.170 This is a very promising result, and further studies are needed to confirm the findings.


Studies have shown that the gut microbiome of individuals with meta- bolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes, differs from that of healthy individuals.173–176 Women with PCOS have a decrease in gut micro- biome diversity compared with healthy women,177–179 and hyperan- drogenism, total testosterone, and hirsutism are negatively correlated with microbiome diversity.180 An analysis of 163 women with PCOS found that higher total testosterone levels, hirsutism, and hyperandro- genism correlate with lower biodiversity in the gut microbiome. The relative abundance of Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides coprophilus, Blautia spp., and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was consistently higher in women with PCOS, whereas Anaerococcus spp., Odoribacter spp., Roseburia spp., and Ruminococcus bromii were lower. Porphyromonas has been reported to increase gut permeability and dysbiosis. The four taxa that had lower abundance in PCOS are all known to synthesize short-chain fatty acids.180 The findings of the study suggest that andro- gens may be an important factor in shaping the gut microbiome, and changes in the gut microbiome may influence the development and pathology of PCOS. Further evidence of the relationship between the gut microbiome and hormonal profiles is that testosterone has been shown to be pro- duced in the gut by Clostridium scindens.181 Another study has shown that the gut microbiota is a principal regulator of circulating estrogens, and disruption in the gut microbiome results in decreased circulat- ing estrogens levels.182 As an aside, metformin has been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiota.182 Obese women with PCOS who have undergone bariatric surgery exhibit reduced symptoms of PCOS, including infertility.183 The composition of the gut microbiome is altered following bariatric surgery, and that may be the driving factor that increases fertility and resolution of PCOS symptoms.184 Further large clinical studies are needed to determine whether specific gut bac- teria play a causative role in PCOS and will also be important in deter- mining whether probiotics are a treatment option for PCOS.

## Actaea racemosa (Black Cohosh)

Actaea racemosa is known to reduce LH and subsequently androgens.185 A prospective, randomized controlled study investigated the role of A. racemosa (Klimadynon, Bionorica) in women with PCOS. The trial involved 100 women. The intervention group (n = 50) received A. rac- emosa 20 mg daily for 10 days, starting on the second day of their cycle, whereas the control group received 50 mg clomiphene citrate twice daily, for 5 days starting on the second day of their cycle, for three con- secutive cycles. The results showed significant positive changes in LH levels and FSH:LH ratio in the A. racemosa group. Progesterone lev- els were increased from the first treatment cycle (indicating improved ovulation), as was endometrial thickness.186 A 2014 study of patients found that administering clomiphene citrate in conjunction with A. racemosa improved ovulation outcomes and pregnancy rates in PCOS. All patients were administered 150 mg clomiphene per day from days 3 to 7 of their cycle. In addition, the intervention group was administered 120 mg A. racemosa (Klimadynon, Bionorica) per day, from day 1 until the day of the pregnancy test or the start of the next cycle. Administration of A. racemosa was associated with lower midcycle LH, higher serum estradiol and progesterone in the second half, significantly thicker endometrium, shorter cycles, and increased pregnancy rates.187

## Cinnamomum spp. (Cinnamon)

Managing IR and, subsequently, the compensatory hyperinsulinemia associated with PCOS is imperative to aid the resolution of the syn- drome as well as to prevent complications such as the development of type 2 diabetes. Cinnamomum spp. contains polyphenols found to stimulate autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase I,188 thereby improving insulin sensi- tivity. Cinnamomum cassia has been studied in vitro and in humans, with studies showing a positive impact on glycemic control in patients with diabetes.189,190 A small pilot study involving women with PCOS with either oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea (n = 15) showed that taking Cinnamomum spp. extract (333 mg of cinnamon three times daily) for 8 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in fasting glucose as well as IR, thought to be mediated through an increase in glucose utilization.188 This highlights the efficacy of Cinnamomum spp. for the management of IR associated with PCOS and provides a rationale for further studies using a larger sample to be conducted. Another small study of 45 women with PCOS found that Cinnamomum spp. supplementation (1.5 g/day for 6 months) improved the frequency of menstrual cycles compared with placebo. The study did not find any changes in measures of IR or serum androgen levels in either the intervention or placebo groups.191 A recent double-blind, random- ized, controlled trial (n = 84) found that supplementation with cinna- mon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) (1500 mg ground cinnamon bark/ day) over 8 weeks improved antioxidant status and serum lipid profile in overweight or obese women with PCOS.192

## Glycyrrhiza glabra (Liquorice)

Hyperandrogenism is characteristic of PCOS, so antiandrogen botani- cals such as Glycyrrhiza glabra are indicated. G. glabra affects androgen metabolism by blocking the effects of β -hydroxysteroid dehydro- genase and C17,20 lyase while stimulating the effects of aromatase, reducing serum testosterone, making it useful as an adjuvant therapy of hirsutism associated with PCOS.193 Glycyrrhizic acid (a triterpenoid saponin glycoside, a bioactive component in G. glabra) possesses protective activity against AGE-induced endothelial dysfunction, including antiapoptosis, anti-inflammation, and antioxidant stress, via inhibiting the RAGE/nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway, and may be potentially useful in the management of PCOS via its anti-inflamma- tory and antioxidant capacity.194

## Gymnema sylvestre (Gymnema)

There is abundant evidence of the link between PCOS and insu- lin resistance. Gymnema sylvestre is a botanical that displays blood sugar–regulating properties and is highly indicated for the man- agement of insulin resistance. As yet, no studies have assessed the effects of Gymnema in PCOS. Gymnema has demonstrated efficacy in a number of human clinical trials in patients with diabetes, where it has been shown to reduce blood sugar; therefore, it is likely to be of help in PCOS.195,196

## Paeonia lactiflora (Peony)

Paeonia lactiflora has been shown to positively influence low proges- terone, reduce elevated androgens (testosterone), and modulate estro- gen and prolactin.185 Administration of a traditional herbal medicine called shakuyaku-kanzo-to, a decoction of G. glabra and P. lactiflora, has undergone a substantial amount of research, particularly with regard to patients with PCOS and infertility. Shakuyaku-kanzo-to was found to lower plasma testosterone levels in 18 out of 20 patients197 and increase fertility, resulting in successful conception, as well as reducing LH:FSH ratios.198

## Schisandra chinensis (Shisandra)

Schisandra chinensis works on both Phase I and Phase II liver metab- olism, where it promotes detoxification and healthy liver function. In PCOS, liver support aids in the clearance of sex hormones from the body and prevents them from recirculating. S. chinensis functions as an adaptogen, which is also likely to be helpful because stress is involved in the etiology of PCOS.

## Tribulus terrestris (Tribulus)

Tribulus assists the patient with PCOS by stimulating the release of FSH. In order to initiate ovulation, the body’s production of FSH needs to be stimulated to reduce the raised LH:FSH ratio. Results of human and animal clinical trials support the FSH-stimulating pre- scription. In one study, 750 mg of active furostanol (TLSE) per day for 5 days was given to women and was shown to increase FSH and estradiol compared with baseline women. The steroidal saponins are thought to bind to and stimulate (weakly) the hypothalamic estro- gen-receptor sites.199 Tribulus (1000 mg hydroalcoholic extract per day for 3 months) has also been shown to lower blood glucose levels in women with type 2 diabetes (n = 98), which may be relevant in PCOS management because of the high rates of metabolic abnormalities that occur in PCOS.200 Note that Tribulus leaf standardized extract (TLSE) is a product obtained from the aerial parts of Tribulus terrestris, which contain mainly saponins of the furostanol type (not less than 45%, calculated as protodioscin). It was developed in Bulgaria from Mediterranean varieties of Tribulus. Tribulus concentrated extract equivalent to fucosterol saponins (protodiosci) is recommended generally in lieu of liquid preparations to obtain the sufficient doses required.

## Vitex agnus castus (Chaste Tree Berry)

Vitex agnus castus is a hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) regula- tor, and because HPO imbalance is associated with PCOS, it is likely to be of benefit in managing the condition. Hyperprolactinemia and an altered response to progesterone are also associated with PCOS201,202; therefore, the progestogenic activity of V. agnus castus and its ability to regulate prolactin will further assist in the management of PCOS symptoms. Most studies on chaste berry for infertility or PCOS have

used a blend of herbs, making it difficult to determine the role of a solitary component. A 12-week trial of 70 women with PCOS found that a combined low-dose oral contraceptive and V. agnus castus were both equally effective in normalizing the menstrual cycle and reducing DHEAS. Neither of the treatments had any effect on testosterone or prolactin levels.203

## Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (Fenugreek Seed)

Fenugreek is a strongly scented herb that is widely used in cooking and as a traditional medicine for diabetes in Asia, with fenugreek seeds exhibiting potential hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects.190 Fenugreek has also demonstrated beneficial effects in reducing body weight and improving anthropometrical parameters.204 An open- label nonrandomized trial of 50 women with PCOS demonstrated that administration of a novel fenugreek seed extract enriched in furostanolic saponins resulted in a significant reduction in cyst size (with 36% of participants showing complete dissolution of the cysts) and the normalization of regular menstrual cycles. The novel extract (1 g/day, enriched in 40% furostanolic saponins) was admin- istered daily over a period of 3 months. Results showed significant increases in LH and FSH compared with baseline.205 These results are supported by findings in a 2-month study (n = 58) in which fenu- greek seed restored eumenorrhea in 55% of women with PCOS and significantly decreased the polycystic ovaries.206 These preliminary studies show very promising results, and further large-scale trials are required.

## Camellia sinesus (Green Tea)

Green tea may have an antiandrogen effect due to the actions of epigal- locatechins, which inhibit the 5-alpha-reductase conversion of normal testosterone into DHT.207 A study into the effects of green tea found a small reduction in body weight in the treatment group compared with placebo, but no differences were found in glucose or lipid metab- olism.208 The 3-month study was conducted on 34 obese women with PCOS, and the treatment consisted of boiled Lung Chen tea powder (2% wt/vol), freeze-dried and administered via capsule. Green tea has also been shown to be beneficial in weight loss and reduced waist circumference in women with central adiposity, highlighting another potential benefit in PCOS management and treatment.209

## Origanum majorana (Marjoram)

A small randomized controlled trial into the effect of marjoram (Origanum majorana) tea on the hormonal profile of women with PCOS (n = 25) found that drinking marjoram tea twice daily for month had a beneficial effect on the hormonal profile. Insulin sensi- tivity was improved, and adrenal androgen levels were reduced in the treatment group compared with placebo. Each tea bag contained 1.4 g of dried organic marjoram.210

## Combination Botanicals

A 3-month trial (n = 122) found that an individualized lifestyle intervention (healthy food choice and exercise) with a combination of C. verum (2250 mg stem bark/day), G. glabra (2250 mg root/ day), H. perforatum (2250 mg flowering herb/day), and P. lactiflora (2250 mg root/day) resulted in a 32.9% reduction in oligomenor- rhea. Significant improvements were also seen in BMI, insulin, and LH; blood pressure; quality of life; depression, anxiety, and stress; and pregnancy rates in the combination treatment group compared with the control group, which was administered T. terrestris (equiv- alent to 40.5 g aerial parts, standardized to furostanol saponins mg/day), administered during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.211

## Lifestyle Measures

Lifestyle interventions are one of the most effective management strategies for PCOS, with recommendations focusing on controlling weight, hormone balance, and insulin resistance via lifestyle modifi- cation (e.g., diet, exercise, and weight loss). Lifestyle interventions are particularly important in patients with prediabetes to delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.212

## Weight Management

Anxiety about weight is one of the psychological symptoms of PCOS.213 Women with PCOS, especially those with concurrent anxiety symp- toms but independent of obesity, have a significantly increased risk of eating disorders, including binge-eating behaviors.214,215 The patient’s capacity to adhere to diet and exercise programs and to maintain an appropriate weight over time is paramount.216

## Weight Loss

Weight loss should be targeted in all overweight women with PCOS through reducing dietary energy intake in the setting of adequate nutritional intake and healthy food choices, irrespective of diet com- position.217 It is important to note that weight loss is difficult to achieve in obese women with PCOS compared with individuals with- out PCOS.218 Even 5% to 10% weight loss of body mass is associated with significant improvement in the clinical metabolic and hormonal markers.219–221 Weight loss also increases the SHBG concentration, reduces the testosterone concentration and androgenic stimulation of the skin, improves menstrual function and conception rates, and reduces miscarriage rates.222 A 2011 Cochrane review found evidence that a healthy lifestyle (healthy diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight) reduces body weight and abdominal fat, reduces tes- tosterone, and improves hair growth and insulin resistance in women with PCOS.223 In obese women with PCOS undergoing infertility treatment, delayed treatment preceded by weight loss had improved outcomes for ovulation and live birth compared with immediate treatment without weight loss.224


Physical activity provides diverse benefits in PCOS, such as improved insulin sensitivity, protection against cardiovascular disease, pres- ervation of lean body mass, positive impact on mood, and reduced morbidity and mortality.212,225 Studies comparing exercise as an inter- vention to treat PCOS typically recommend 30 to 45 min of vigorous, but not moderate, exercise three times per week.226–228 It is necessary to tailor exercise levels to the starting BMI in order to achieve opti- mum effect.

## Stress Management

Due to the interaction between endocrine pathways and subsequent effects of stress on HPA/HPO axes, it is imperative to recommend stress management practices. Exercise may be the best recommenda- tion due to its dual benefit, but meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, and sufficient sleep and rest are also beneficial recommendations. Daily mindfulness breathing and diaphragm breathing exercises reduced stress, anxiety, and depression scores; lowered salivary cor- tisol levels; and increased Life Satisfaction and quality-of-life scores in women with PCOS.229 Women with PCOS who are experiencing psychological stress should be assessed for maladaptive coping, particularly the use of escape–avoidance coping. Studies of coping in women with PCOS in Turkey and Germany indicated that women used maladaptive coping

strategies that were associated with depression, anxiety, and diminished HRQL, including brooding, withdrawal, self-pity, or helplessness. Women with increased psychological stress may need encouragement to use more resourceful problem-solving and positive-reappraisal strategies. Social support appears to be an important coping mecha- nism. Referral to a mental health specialist may be appropriate.230


• Aim for a diet of 30% complex carbohydrates, 40% protein, and 30% lipids. Low-carbohydrate diets and/or high-protein diets have been found to have significant benefits for weight loss and insulin regulation in PCOS.218 • Avoid alcohol, caffeine, smoking, and nutritional stressors. • Reduce intake of saturated and trans fats. • Increase fiber intake. • Improve weight balance and advise to stabilize weight as required. • Reduce insulin resistance, stabilize blood sugar levels, and avoid fluctuations that compound PCOS presentation by avoiding refined carbohydrates and sugar. • Support and prevent metabolic syndrome and associated com- pounding factors by supporting the lipid profile through the health of the cardiovascular system and liver. • Choose appropriate caloric intake for weight management in lean women with PCOS or weight loss for overweight women with PCOS. Hypocaloric diets have been shown to be effective for weight loss and improvement of metabolic and hormonal abnormalities in PCOS.218

## 1708SECTION 6 Diseases

The rate-limiting enzyme for heme synthesis is ALA synthase, which is the initial enzyme in the cascade. ALA synthase requires vita- min cofactors and energy input. All other reactions in the sequence are the result of thermodynamics and are irreversible once initiated. ALA synthase is regulated by a feedback mechanism that is respon- sive to the tissues’ demand for heme production. With the formation of uroporphyrinogen, branching occurs and results in different por- phyrin isomers. Isomer I proceeds only as far as coproporphyrin I and normally is considered inconsequential. Isomer III results in the formation of uroporphyrinogen III, which undergoes modification to render it more lipophilic so that it can be excreted from the body. Thus, most of the pathway favors heme production (Fig. 210.1).

## Heme Formation

Final heme formation is regulated by the action of ferrochelatase in the mitochondria. Reducing substances such as ascorbic acid, cysteine, or glutathione are required. Iron must be in the ferrous rather than ferric form. Ferrochelatase activity is inhibited by high concentrations of heme. Thus the feedback system prevents further formation. Heme concentration also feeds back on ALA synthase, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway. Because heme formation is essential for aerobic metabolism, its absence would be lethal. Therefore multiple control systems have evolved to regulate the metabolic pathway, which has made it diffi- cult to elucidate the exact mechanism of the deficit, be it genetic or acquired. Recent advances in identifying specific DNA encoding the heme biosynthetic enzymes, however, have resulted in a more precise diagnosis of the specific genetic deficit. Red blood cell (RBC) incorporation of heme, iron, and glycine occurs in maturing cells up through and including reticulocytes but is eventually lost as the red cell ages. Hypoxia and erythropoietin will increase ALA synthase activity in RBCs but not the liver, whereas drugs and chemicals will affect the liver but not erythropoietic tissues. Fig. 210.2 illustrates heme synthesis and porphyria.

## Manifestation of Porphyria

In patients with porphyria, specific genetic or acquired deficiencies limit the flow of heme precursors through the cascade of steps needed to form hemoglobin. The deficiency can become manifest owing to an increased demand for heme precursors. Certain drugs, chemicals, steroids, estro- gens, oral contraceptives, progesterone, testosterone, or any substance that places an excess burden on the cytochrome P-450 system can act to precipitate an acute attack. This results from the partial removal of the feedback mechanism on delta-ALA synthase. Depending on the specific enzyme deficit present, heme precursors follow different pathways, result- ing in their accumulation in the tissues. Their presence affects the skin and nervous system and manifests as the signs and symptoms of the disease. Attacks occur more frequently in women than men, especially premenstrually. As the person ages, the likelihood of exposure of an underlying porphyria deficit increases because of increased exposure to environmental toxins and the aging body’s decreasing ability to adapt. Cutaneous manifestations occur because some porphyritic pre- cursors absorb light at 400 nm, resulting in photosensitivity.

absorption of light raises the potential energy of the molecule to an “excited” state, resulting in a highly reactive oxygen species. The release of histamine and proteolytic enzymes then results in oxidative damage. Beta-carotene protects against these injuries.3–5 Neuropsychiatric changes occur in the hepatic porphyrias (ALA- dehydrase-deficiency porphyria, AIP, porphyria cutanea tarda, heredi- tary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria) with excess production of ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG), and there is a somewhat linear relationship between their concentration and the severity and dura- tion of symptoms. A buildup of porphyrin intermediaries has been found in various tissues and may induce the neuropsychiatric symp- toms accompanying acute flareups.6,7 The exact mechanism whereby porphyrins affect the central nervous system is not well understood. Patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually pres- ent at a younger age than those who develop PCT spontaneously, despite the fact that there is no difference in the biochemical features of the disease.8 This may be because of a corresponding genetic predis- position to sequester ferritin in the liver or an increased sensitivity to ethanol ingestion.8,9 Additionally, even in families with known genetic deficits, manifestations of the disease among family members vary.

## Signs and Symptoms of Hepatic Porphyrias

Acute attacks are comprised of a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from skin lesions to abdominal pain to neurological manifestations of varying intensity. Abdominal, back, or extremity pain grows in inten- sity over a 24- to 48-hour period, which may lead the clinician to con- sider appendicitis or an acute abdomen. Rebound tenderness is not usually present. Nausea and vomiting are frequently seen, as are anxiety and rest- lessness. Often these patients have some degree of constipation that worsens as the condition develops. Tachycardia may also be present, suggesting an infectious process or increased bowel toxicity. In general, the severity of the symptom pattern seems to the clinician to be out of proportion to the manifesting signs. It is thought that the bowel symptoms are due to a neurological disturbance of normal function. Mental abnormalities can range from confusion to acute psycho- sis and may be the first presentation of an attack. With prolonged attacks, sensory and motor functions are impaired and can result in respiratory paralysis and death.10 Many patients are diagnosed with schizophrenia, and a considerable number of those confined to mental institutions are thought to be afflicted with one of the porphyrias.11,12 The majority of carriers are usually asymptomatic, except when they are exposed to drugs or chemicals that exacerbate the condition. Neurological symptoms and the sequelae of an acute or prolonged attack can take months to clear, but eventual recovery occurs in the majority of cases.

# LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF PORPHYRIA

Small amounts of porphyrins are excreted in normal human urine, the most predominant of which is coproporphyrin. Coproporphyrin is also present in the bile and feces. ALA, PBG, and uroporphyrin are largely excreted in the urine, whereas coproporphyrin is pref- erentially and protoporphyrin exclusively excreted in the bile and feces. Fecal excretion is also affected by diet and bowel flora, thus con- tributing to its wide variation. Geographical distribution, dietary pref- erences, ethnic diversities, and differences in test methodologies make it difficult to arrive at “normal” values. PBG excretion in the urine of healthy individuals is usually below 1.5 mg/day and is undetectable by conventional testing. The Watson– Schwartz qualitative test for PBG will be positive in acute attacks of AIP and variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria in latent periods.13 There is a high false-negative rate owing to its subjec- tive nature. A false increase in porphyrins from a substance present in yeast tablets has been demonstrated to produce a false-positive Watson–Schwartz test.14 A cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of porphyric syndromes in the presence of acute symptoms has been suggested: Glycine + Succinyl CoA δ-Aminolevulinic Acid Porphobilinogen Hydroxymethylbilane Uroporphyrinogen IUroporphyrinogen III Coproporphyrinogen III Protoporphyrinogen IX Protoporphyrin IX Heme Fe2+ Coproporphyrinogen I (Nonenzymatic) Fig. 210.2 Heme synthesis and porphyria.

## 1710SECTION 6 Diseases

If neurovisceral features suggest an acute porphyric syndrome, a rapid screening test for urinary porphobilinogen should be per- formed. If clinical features suggest a cutaneous porphyria, then for solar urticaria and acute photosensitivity (suggesting protopor- phyria) screening tests for increased erythrocytic porphyrins should be done; for vesiculobullous formation (suggesting porphyria cuta- nea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, or variegate porphyria) a screening test for urinary porphyrins should be done. Positive screen- ing tests should be confirmed with targeted quantitative testing.15 Enzymatic assays and DNA-based testing are not usually necessary for the rapid diagnosis or management of symptomatic subjects with acute disease. Such tests are, however, useful for evaluation and genetic counseling. Isolation of specific DNA encoding the heme biosynthetic pathway enzymes makes it possible to now provide precise heterozy- gote identification as well as prenatal diagnosis in families with known defects.4,15,16 Other cell markers may also help in identifying patients with por- phyria in the absence of symptoms. Leukocyte concentrations of man- ganese, calcium, iron, zinc, and erythrocyte calcium have been shown to be present at different concentrations between groups classified as AIP gene carriers. Of the cell markers, manganese was found to be the most discriminative component of all the variables investigated. An increase in cellular manganese by a factor of four suggests an increase in the likelihood of development of AIP.17 Because of the many possible genetic deficits leading to porphyria, it is important that the specific deficit be determined; successful treat- ment outcomes depend on the correct diagnosis. See also Chapter 30 for more discussion of the diagnosis of porphyrinopathies.

## Etiological Agents Triggering Porphyria

Numerous agents that trigger episodes of porphyria have been iden- tified, and patients afflicted must be careful when taking prescription medications, estrogens, and some herbal medicines; they must also avoid environmental exposures to heavy metals, organophosphates, and any substance that places an excess burden on the cytochrome P-450 system. In particular, exogenous estrogens—whether from oral contraceptives, estrogen patches, or estrogen replacement therapy— are strong contributors to an underlying porphyria deficit.18,19 This is one reason why acute attacks of porphyria are seen more often in women than men, especially premenstrually. Additionally, some stud- ies have suggested that estrogens enhance the porphyrin-inducing activities of other agents, making women more vulnerable to environ- mental exposures than their male counterparts.20,21 Herbicide-induced porphyria has been shown to decrease the activ- ity of several enzymes involved in the porphyritic pathway as well as to increase the porphyrin content in nerve tissue.21,22 A considerable number of chemicals have also been linked to porphyria or porphyrin- uria in humans; these generally involve chronic industrial exposures or environmental exposures. An example of an epidemic of PCT pro- duced by the accidental ingestion of wheat treated with the fungicide hexachlorobenzene occurred in Turkey in the 1950s. Some researchers have hypothesized that several otherwise unex- plained chemical-associated illnesses, such as multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome (MCSS), may represent mild chronic cases of porphyria or other acquired abnormalities in heme synthesis.23,24 According to William Morton, who has written extensively on por- phyrias, MCSS as first described by Cullen in 1979 may, in fact, be porphyria. Morton speculates that exposures to porphyrogenic chem- icals, medications, or severe infection overpower the already-deficient enzyme system, resulting in an accumulation of the specific porphyrin because of diminished enzyme function. He proposed that the resul- tant symptoms are due to an increase of the porphyrinogen and not an accumulation of the toxin itself. Many diagnosticians have tried to expedite the distinction between “real” porphyria and secondary por- phyrinopathies by requiring that a porphyria diagnosis be based on urinary or fecal porphyrin excretions, or both, of 2 to 20 times the upper limit of normal. This classification would exclude individuals demonstrating lesser degrees of porphyrinogenic activity, possibly some of those whose conditions are in remission or not subject to envi- ronmental exposures.25 The intensity of porphyria symptoms varies widely. About 10% of the cases present with severe acute attacks, whereas approximately 25% are seen with chronic symptomatology of varying degrees. The remain- ing percentage (65%) presents with no symptoms but may become susceptible under the right circumstances.26 Not all researchers agree with Morton’s and others’ premise that environmental toxicities induce underlying genetic deficits leading to symptomatic porphyria. According to Hahn and Bonkovsky, “patients with multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome may, at times, have mod- est increases in urinary coproporphyrin excretion; this is a common finding found in many asymptomatic subjects or patients with diverse other conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol use, liver dis- ease, and many kinds of anemia). Such secondary coproporphyrinuria does not indicate the existence of coproporphyria.”27 Regardless of which view is correct, an increasing number of cases are being diagnosed by clinicians. Certainly, with the increasing lev- els of pollutants in the environment, hormonal additives to the food chain, and the unmonitored multiple pharmacy prescriptions encoun- tered by most humans, the potential for unmasking an underlying deficit increases.


It is important to identify patients who are predisposed and suscep- tible to the development of porphyritic episodes. On seeing a patient with a past medical history of periodic psychotic episodes or nervous breakdown, unexplained abdominal pain, or unusual symptoms that have led to numerous diagnoses, the physician should be alerted to the possibility of an underlying porphyria. Prevention is clearly the first option because porphyritic episodes can be difficult to control once initiated.28 The treatment of patients afflicted with acute episodes of porphyria can be demanding because of the severity of the condition and the unstable clinical picture. Each patient presentation is different depend- ing on the degree of toxicity, genetic component, and patient response to therapy. Homeopathic treatment has proved successful, but differ- ent homeopathic medicines are required depending on the clin- ical picture, which, as has been mentioned, can change quickly. Constitutional prescribing does not seem to work as well when the patient is in an acute state, and several prescriptions may be necessary to help the patient to become stable. The prescriptions may have to be changed frequently as the patient progresses through the varying stages of the disease. During an acute episode, frequent follow-up is necessary in order to assess the clinical state. In some cases, patients must be seen daily, and medications altered depending on the presentation. Education of the patient as to his or her condition is one of the most important tasks. Often the patient does not want to believe that a genetic affliction exists and will seek another diagnosis. He or she has often received various diagnoses and may still believe that this condition is another disorder. It will be important to delineate which

symptoms go with each condition, but they will all probably be related to the porphyria. Additionally, informing other physicians seen by the patient as to his or her condition will help to keep prescription drugs to a minimum, thus decreasing the likelihood of an exacerbation. The course of therapy required for the patient to reach a state where he or she is not as susceptible to environmental toxins is usually long and involves periods of exacerbation and remission. Helping the patient to understand this will facilitate the recovery. Environmental and chemical exposures must be eliminated by identifying offending agents and limiting exposures. Lists of prescrip- tion medicines and environmental toxins that cause exacerbation of porphyria are available (Boxes 210.2 and 210.3). A complete history as to environmental and work-related exposures is in order. Often, simply by changing the patient’s work environment, exposures will be decreased and attacks eliminated.


During attacks of AIP, an increased intake of complex carbohydrates can help to alleviate symptoms. Often the patient is ingesting high amounts of carbohydrates when first seen, and weight gain often fol- lows. Intravenous glucose can also be given (300–400 g/day). A more complete parenteral nutritional regimen is preferable, however. Fasting or rapid-weight-loss diets can precipitate AIP and should be avoided. A diet rich in high-fiber fruits and vegetables has been shown to be remarkably effective in improving several measures of porphyria. A 3-week study of 13 male patients with PCT found that 500 kcal/ day of fruits and vegetables resulted in a significant decrease in body Modified from Sassa S, Kappas A. The porphyrias.

Skin lesions also improved, and urinary coproporphyrin excretion decreased. There was a statistically insignificant reduction in uropor- phyrin excretion.29

## Antioxidants

Antioxidant therapy, along with homeopathy, is the mainstay of case management during acute porphyritic episodes.30 Once the patient has stabilized, an ongoing regimen of antioxidants such as vita- min C, vitamin E, glutathione, beta-carotene, and N-acetylcysteine should be undertaken in order to prevent recurrence.31 Vitamin C has been found to be low in patients with PCT.32 Subjective evalu- ation of the use of high-dose vitamin C (1 g a day) compared with placebo was conducted in 12 patients with erythropoietic protopor- phyria photosensitivity for a period of 4 weeks. Although there was no statistical significance to the fact that patients fared better on the high-dose vitamin C, 8 of the 12 participants reported less sensitivity to sunlight.33 High-dose vitamin E supplementation (1 g/day of alpha-tocoph- erol) in patients with PCT decreased urinary excretion of uropor- phyrins (50% of the C8 carboxyls), with clinical improvement in all patients.34 The effect lasted only as long as vitamin E was being sup- plemented. Treatment with vitamin E was found to reduce residual oxidative stress while not affecting the increased plasma and whole- blood viscosity present in patients with PCT who were receiving only phlebotomy treatment before clinical remission.35 Combinations of antioxidants are also being looked at as a mode of treatment for the various porphyrias. A study comparing the pro- tective ability of several antioxidants used concurrently for the photo- toxicity of protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) and uroporphyrin I (UP I) was conducted on cell cultures. The researchers found that cell growth and cell-membrane protection showed differences in protection for the two types of porphyrias. Both beta-carotene and lycopene and the combi- nation of beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol offered cell protection against PP IX phototoxicity. For membrane protection, there was significant protection against UP I by the combination of beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol compared with any of these antioxidants alone. The authors concluded that a combina- tion of beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol offers mem- brane protection against the phototoxicity of both porphyrins, which is believed to occur as a result of synergistic processes. Their results suggest that the treatment of porphyria cutanea tarda and erythropoi- etic protoporphyria may be improved by the use of a combination of the antioxidants studied.36 Additionally, it is thought that the increase in oxidative damage from photodermatitis would contribute to lower vitamin D lev- els. Lower levels of vitamin D have been implicated more recently as contributing to a number of medical conditions, such as stroke, osteoporosis, hip fracture, and muscle weakness.37 A cohort of patients with known erythrocytic protoporphyria (EPP) was evalu- ated over a 7-month period for the deficiency of vitamin D levels due to lowered sun exposure. Thirty-four patients (17%) were deficient in vitamin D, and 126 (63%) were found to have insufficient levels of vitamin D. Both insufficiency and deficiency were significantly asso- ciated with the total erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration and inversely with the time in minutes to the onset of symptoms following sunlight exposure. The authors concluded that in patients with por- phyrias associated with photodermatitis, vitamin D therapy should be considered.38 In two studies, melatonin as an antioxidant was evaluated for its effects on delta-aminolevulinic acid–induced oxidative toxicity in neu- ral tissue and as a cotreatment in patients suffering from disturbances related to ALA accumulation. In in vivo experiments, it was demon- strated that lipid peroxidation induced by delta-aminolevulinic acid (40 mg/kg) in the cerebellum and hippocampus was reduced by acute melatonin (10 mg/kg) administration.39 In the other study, it was con- cluded that melatonin had marked efficacy in protecting against ALA- related oxidative stress and its oncostatic properties. Moreover, it was concluded that its low toxicity constituted a reason to consider the use of melatonin as a cotreatment in patients suffering from disturbances related to ALA accumulation.40

## B-Complex Vitamins

Because pantothenic acid is required for the formation of succinyl-co- enzyme A (CoA) (generated by the tricarboxylic acid cycle) and glycine, which are the precursors to the formation of ALA, supplementation is helpful. Additionally, a step in the transformation of succinyl-CoA requires a vitamin B 12 –dependent enzyme, and evaluation of vitamin B 12 and folic acid status may be in order. The initial reaction is oxygen dependent, which may mean that oxygen therapy is contraindicated in delta-ALA porphyria. ALA formation requires and is dependent on pyridoxal-5-phos- phate; hence, any substance that inhibits enzyme systems is countered in part by the addition of pyridoxal-5-phosphate. However, experi- mental models suggest that this agent does not play an important role.3

## Carotenoids

All cutaneous porphyrias can be alleviated by the avoidance of sun- light. Treatment of erythropoietic protoporphyria with large doses of beta-carotene has been effective and may improve tolerance to sun- light.41 Another study showed that mixed carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lycopene) were effective in cell cultures, although any one of these used alone was ineffective.

## Iron

Several lines of evidence suggest that excessive iron stores and con- sumption aggravate some porphyrias.42 Iron should be avoided unless supplementation is clearly indicated by low iron stores.

## Detoxification

Detoxification of the liver and colon is indicated as an ongoing process to eliminate toxins that may exacerbate the condition. Regardless of whether the toxin actually precipitates an attack of porphyria, elimina- tion on an ongoing basis reduces the chance of an acute flareup of the disease. Detoxification can be achieved through colon hydrotherapies, constitutional hydrotherapies, saunas, antioxidants, or oxygen thera- pies such as ozone. Supplementation with lipotrophic factors that enhance the func- tion of the liver’s cytochrome P-450 system is contraindicated during acute attacks but useful when the patient is in a period of normal- ity. Incorporating them, as well as high doses of antioxidants, helps decrease the number of acute attacks. Additionally, chelation therapies with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and ethanol extracts of botanical medicines are contraindicated in patients with a predisposition to developing porphyria.

## Constitutional Hydrotherapy

Constitutional hydrotherapy during an acute flareup is effective in normalizing liver function as well as neurological symptoms. Daily ses- sions may be necessary to accomplish this while allowing the physician to monitor the patient closely.43

## Ozone Therapy

Ozone therapy is primarily indicated when there is a deficit of copro- porphyrinogen oxidase, resulting in a deficit of coporphyrinogen in hereditary coproporphyria. It is contraindicated when there is a deficit of ALA synthase because higher amounts of oxygen enhance the path- way and exacerbate the symptoms.


The primary clinical approach is to identify the condition early and avoid irritating and aggravating factors. Sun exposure should be lim- ited when cutaneous manifestations are present.


The patient’s diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables and low in iron.


• Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 400 to 1200 IU/day • Mixed carotenes: 100,000 to 150,000 IU/day • Vitamin C: 3000 to 5000 mg/day • Vitamin D: 5000 to 10,000 IU/day (measure blood levels to deter- mine optimal dosage) • Melatonin: 3 mg/day

of births by this method in 2000. CS births were almost five times more frequent in births in the wealthiest versus the poorest quintiles in low-income and middle-income countries.11 The WHO and UNICEF show that worldwide CS rates increased 3.7% each year between and 2015. Thus, in 2018, the WHO issued a first-of-its-kind guideline for implementing recommendations on nonclinical interventions to reduce CS births.12 The WHO has long recommended a rate for CS between 10% to 15% due to medical necessity. However, in the United States, although the rate of CS has declined in recent years, it remains two to three times higher than the WHO guideline.13 Due to significant advances in health care, rates of infant mortal- ity in developed countries have declined since 1960, including in the United States. However, the decline in infant mortality rates in the United States has not kept pace with other developed countries, and clear disparities in birth outcomes remain a concern.14 A 2018 study examined mortality trends for the United States and 19 comparator nations in the OECD for children ages 0 to 19 from 1961 to using publicly available data. Compared with similar OECD countries, infant mortality rates in the United States were 76% higher, due to extreme immaturity, and U.S. infants were 2.3 times more likely to experience sudden infant death syndrome between 2001 and 2010, the most recent years for which comparable data are available across all the countries. The researchers concluded that if the United States had kept pace with the overall OECD decline in infant mortality since 1960, this would have resulted in approximately 600,000 fewer infant deaths over the course of 50 years. The United States outspends every other OECD nation on health care per capita for children, yet infant and child mor- tality outcomes remain below targets.15

# PRECONCEPTION

Maternal health status before conception is strongly linked to healthy pregnancy outcomes.16 Preconception counseling affords the health care provider an opportunity to support women and parents by dis- cussing a variety of medical, behavioral, and social factors that may be modified before conception, thereby helping individuals to make well-informed and well-considered decisions, with the intention of reducing the risk of poor maternal and birth outcomes.17 Preconception counseling should be comprehensive, taking into account the following for optimal prenatal care and attention: (1) review of medical, surgical, and psychiatric histories and immuniza- tions, medications, dietary supplements, family history, and genetic history; (2) infectious disease screening; (3) substance use assessment; (4) exposure to violence, intimate partner violence, and reproductive and sexual coercion; (5) nutritional status assessment; (6) achieving and maintaining healthy body weight; (7) exercise and physical activity assessment; (8) assessment for teratogen and environmental toxicant exposures; and (9) correct pregnancy dating.18 Culturally appropri- ate discussion around family planning and prevention of unintended pregnancy should also be included at this visit. Women’s bodies undergo rapid and substantial changes during pregnancy, brought about by both hormonal and mechanical effects. These significant physiological changes occur in order to nurture the developing fetus and prepare the mother for labor and delivery.19 These physiological adaptations occur in nearly all maternal organ sys- tems. The first sign of pregnancy is usually a missed menstrual period, followed by nonconcerning symptoms such as urinary frequency, fatigue, breast tenderness, and nausea. During the second trimester, the body undergoes postural changes to accommodate the changing center of gravity, which can lead to back pain for many women. In the third trimester, the expanding uterus displaces many internal organs as it grows. Cardiovascular and respiratory changes occur as the body accommodates the growing fetus. For example, circulating blood volume increases by 30% to 50% as the uterus expands, which also increases cardiac output; and there can be reduced movement of the diaphragm, which leads to shortness of breath.20 Common conditions, including urinary tract infections, anemia, hypertension, and dysgly- cemia, can present differently during pregnancy, and it is therefore advised to include appropriate screening in prenatal care. With the average age of U.S. women at their first birth having increased over the past decade, it is important to consider how aging affects fertility and pregnancy. Age has physiological effects on fer- tility that can reduce conception rates. Once conception does occur, age can increase the risk for complications of pregnancy, including hypertension, diabetes, and birth defects resulting from chromosomal abnormalities.21 A growing body of research suggests that increased susceptibility to chronic disease in adulthood originates, in part, during fetal devel- opment. During the time of early embryonic development, paren- tal lifestyle can adversely influence the long-term risks of offspring. Fetal organ structures develop at varying points in development, and in utero exposure to toxins can directly affect cardiovascular, meta- bolic, immune, and neurological development.16 Inadequate levels of key nutrients during crucial periods of fetal development may lead to reprogramming within fetal tissues, predisposing the infant to neuro- developmental problems and chronic diseases later in life. These con- ditions include developmental delays, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.22 The emerging field of epigenetics involves the study of the process by which stable, heritable alterations to gene expression, and thus the phenotype of cells, are induced without changes to the primary DNA sequence or genotype.23 These modifications can be altered in response to environmental factors, including periconceptional stress, maternal nutritional status during pregnancy, and fetal exposure to toxicants. Epigenetics is well exemplified in the case of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM),24 which can develop during pregnancy (usually in the late second trimester) when maternal insulin production can no lon- ger cope within increasing adiposity and insulin resistance and affects 5% of all first-time pregnancies worldwide.25 With GDM already being the most common metabolic disorder occurring in pregnancy, its prevalence continues to grow, given increasing numbers of women of advanced age becoming pregnant and the increasing epidemic of maternal obesity.26 Adverse potential complications associated with GDM occur during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, and postpartum. Insulin is a major fetal growth hormone, which can lead to macroso- mia and increased risk for operative delivery. Intrauterine exposure to GDM causes epigenetic modifications and fetal metabolic pro- gramming, which confers increased risk of lifelong consequences for offspring, including the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in adulthood.27 Indeed, mounting evidence suggests that the prenatal period constitutes a critical convergence of short- and long- term modifying factors affecting the lifelong health of both mother and child.22 Nutritional and lifestyle counseling should thus serve as a fundamental cornerstone of prenatal and pregnancy care in order to optimize a healthy uterine environment for optimal fetal development while supporting maternal health. Although various complications can occur regardless of precon- ception counseling and pregnancy planning, antenatal care offers a significant opportunity for promoting positive pregnancy experiences and primary prevention by means of reducing maternal and fetal mor- bidity and mortality by educating and supporting women throughout pregnancy, preventing unintended pregnancy, managing and even reversing concurrent medical conditions, identifying cases of intimate partner violence, differentiating between expected variations, and

managing potential complications and offering appropriate interven- tions. Women’s positive experiences during antenatal care and child- birth can create the foundations for healthy motherhood.1 Moreover, health before conception is strongly correlated to the outcome of preg- nancy, and life-course research pinpoints the preconception period as crucial for health across generations.28

# NUTRITION

Healthy food choices and dietary awareness play vital roles before and during pregnancy, with the pregnant woman requiring adequate intake of energy, protein, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to meet both maternal and fetal needs. Maternal metabolism is altered to redirect nutrients to the placenta and fetus. Epigenetic influence, or fetal programming, is transgenerational and long-lasting,29 with the risk of developing childhood- and adult-onset disease determined, in large part, by maternal nutritional status at conception and during pregnancy and lactation. With respect to caloric needs and food consumption during preg- nancy, the commonly espoused idea that pregnant women should be “eating for two” is a myth. Most pregnant women will need between 2200 and 2900 calories per day, with the estimated energy requirement generally remaining the same as for nonpregnant women in the first tri- mester. Extra energy needs increase in the second and third trimesters to an estimated 340 kcal per day and 452 kcal per day, respectively.30 Energy requirements vary based on a woman’s age, preconception body mass index (BMI), trimester of pregnancy, gestational weight gain (GWG), and level of physical activity. “Eating for two” is not in any way representational of the nominal 10% to 25% increase in caloric intake actually required to support a healthy pregnancy.31 For pregnant women who consume unneeded extra calories, rather than focusing caloric intake on nutrient-dense foods, their dietary choices may be 15% to 30% above target calorie levels32 and lead to excessive and detrimental GWG with respect to National Academy of Medicine 2009 (NAM) guidelines (see “Healthy Weight” section). Unfortunately, most women in the United States still significantly increase their caloric consumption during pregnancy, with 53% of all women, 70% of overweight women, and 64% of obese women exceeding NAM guidelines for GWG in 2011–2012.33 Indeed, a recent comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis evalu- ated associations between GWG above or below NAM guidelines and pregnancy outcomes. Based on data from 23 studies meeting inclusion criteria involving 1,309,136 pregnant women, GWG was above NAM guidelines in 47% of participants and below guidelines in 23%. Compared with women having GWG within NAM recom- mended levels, weight gain above and below guidelines was associ- ated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes. GWG greater than recommendations was associated with higher risk of large-for-ges- tational-age (LGA) infants, macrosomia, and cesarean delivery, whereas GWG below guidelines was associated with higher risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and PTB.34 The study prompts two questions: Are health care providers able to modify the amount of weight women gain in pregnancy, and can altering GWG to within NAM recommendations during pregnancy improve preg- nancy outcomes? These questions were answered in the first large-scale study of its kind, which sought to investigate the impact of dietary and physical activity–based lifestyle interventions on GWG and subsequent preg- nancy outcomes. The systematic review and meta-analysis involved more than 50 researchers from 41 institutions in 16 countries and analyzed individual participant data from 36 randomized trials and 12,526 participants. The study compared the effects of healthy dietary recommendations (e.g., restriction of sugar-sweetened beverages, increased servings of fruits and vegetables, choosing low-fat dairy options) combined with physical activity (e.g., moderate intensity, including aerobic classes, stationary cycling, and resistance train- ing as 150 minutes of dedicated activity per week) throughout preg- nancy. Participants following the lifestyle modifications demonstrated a reduced GWG by an average of 0.7 kg compared with the control group. The researchers were able to conclude that maintaining a mod- erated healthy diet and following standard physical activity guidelines during pregnancy had a significant impact on reducing excessive GWG and thus concomitantly decreased the associated risk of GDM, preterm birth, and CS delivery.35 Cohort studies have suggested that dietary patterns up to 3 years before pregnancy—characterized by a diet rich in consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and select fish, along with low intake of red and processed meats—are associated with reduced risk of GDM, preeclampsia, and PTB.36 Protein is the macronutrient most influential with respect to birth weight.37 Low birth weight and preterm delivery are considered to be the most relevant determinants of newborn infant morbidity and mor- tality in both developed and developing countries. Having been studied in many distinct populations, low birth weight has also been associated with placing an infant at greater risk for the development of various adult-onset chronic medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, coronary artery disease, asthma, oste- oporosis, and early menopause, to name a few.38 The recommended protein intake during pregnancy is a minimum of 60 g per day, which represents an increase from 46 g per day in nonpregnant states, reflect- ing an increase to 1.1 g of protein/kg/day from 0.8 g of protein/kg/day, respectively.39 Sixty grams of protein per day will account for approxi- mately 20% to 25% of daily caloric intake. Pregnant women need the energy provided by complex carbohy- drates because glucose is a major fuel used for intrauterine growth. Complex carbohydrates should comprise 45% to 65% of daily calories.30 Fats play an essential part of a healthy diet during pregnancy and are used primarily as an energy source. Total dietary fat intake should approximate 20% to 35% of daily calories depending on one’s carbo- hydrate goals.30 Increased consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is emphasized because they play a critical role in brain development. Saturated fats should be limited to less than 10% of total daily caloric intake, and trans fatty acids should be avoided whenever possible.31 Maintaining adequate fiber consumption during pregnancy is important, with a goal of 20 g to 35 g per day. More is better, but increase slowly to allow adaptation. Constipation tends to occur more frequently in the first trimester (35% of women) and second trimester (39%), with 20% to 17% of women affected in the third trimester and postpartum, respectively.40 First-line, nonpharmacological management of consti- pation includes increasing adequate hydration, getting regular exercise/ being physically active, and eating plenty of fiber-rich foods. An Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position paper states that well-planned, plant-based diets—whether vegan, lacto-ovo-vegetarian (includes dairy and egg products), lacto-vegetarian, or ovo-vegetar- ian—are appropriate and can provide the nutrient needs and promote growth at all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy and lactation. Although limited, research also suggests that where access to healthy food is satisfactory and when compared with nonvegetarian/omnivo- rous diets, pregnancy outcomes are similar for vegans and vegetarians, including average birth weight and full-term deliveries.41 One study demonstrated that following a vegetarian diet in the first trimester was inversely associated with excessive GWG.42 Vegan and vegetarian

women have also been found to have reduced risk of pregnancy com- plications such as GDM and preeclampsia; lower-than-average rate of CS delivery; lower neonatal and maternal mortality, with no complica- tions or negative outcomes that are higher than average; and less post- partum depression.43 Consuming a vegan or vegetarian diet composed of organically grown foods also minimizes in utero exposure to toxic chemicals. Maternal vegan and vegetarian diets do, however, require special attention with respect to obtaining a reliable and adequate intake of critical nutrients, namely, vitamin B 12 , zinc, iron, iodine, vitamin D, and the essential omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).44 It is therefore advised that pregnant and lactating vegans and vegetarians consider taking a comprehen- sive daily prenatal multivitamin-mineral dietary supplement as well as an algae-derived omega-3 supplement yielding DHA and EPA. In addition, research is emerging that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can substantially influence the need for specific nutrients in the diet. For example, although it is common to use vitamin A and beta-carotene interchangeably, in fact, a substantial portion of the pop- ulation makes this conversion very poorly (see Chapter 125, Vitamin A). The more strictly vegetarian a woman’s diet, the more important it is for the clinician to monitor for adequate amounts of needed nutri- ents not typically found in nonanimal sources. Given that pregnant women and their unborn children are far more susceptible to and at greater risk than the general population of con- tracting foodborne illnesses, because of hormonal changes that lead to decreased cell-mediated immune function, special caution is recom- mended with respect to safe food handling and preparation.45 Of great- est concern are Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, Brucella species, Salmonella species, and Campylobacter jejuni, and pregnant women should closely adhere to food-safety recommendations.46 During pregnancy and lactation, being cognizant of nutritional needs is critical to optimize maternal adaptation, fetal development, and infant health. A majority of women, especially for first-time pregnancies, have heightened concerns about nutritional needs and healthy food choices and confusion over optimal dietary planning. Thus, preconception and pregnancy bring an opportune time for health care providers to offer evidence-based nutritional guidance and reassurance. A personalized approach to dietary counseling should be the cor- nerstone of antenatal care and take into account the following factors whenever possible: a woman’s access to healthy food, health literacy, physical activity level, socioeconomic status and economic restraints, race/ethnicity, context for cultural attitudes, food practices and prepa- ration methods, as well as a woman’s preconception and early preg- nancy nutritional status and BMI. A diet rich in organic whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and select wild-caught fish is desirable for healthy pregnancy outcomes. Improving and implementing mater- nal dietary choices and habits before, during, and after pregnancy reduces the risk of medical problems for the mother and her infant.31

# HYDRATION

Adequate fluid intake is essential for a healthful pregnancy. Water con- stitutes approximately 55% to 65% of a woman’s body weight,47 and during pregnancy, her fluid requirements increase in order to main- tain total body water homeostasis and support cellular metabolism, fetal circulation, amniotic fluid volume, and increased blood volume. Amniotic fluid is maintained in dynamic equilibrium, and the amniotic fluid volume (AFV) is an important parameter in the assess- ment of fetal well-being because of the essential role AFV plays in nor- mal fetal growth and development. The AFV progressively increases as gestation progresses. Amniotic fluid is produced once the amniotic sac is formed at 12 days after conception and is initially composed of water provided by the mother. At 10 weeks’ gestation, AFV is 10 to 20 mL, rising to 800 mL at 33 weeks, plateauing at 1000 mL at 38 to 39 weeks, and eventually decreasing to 800 mL at 40 weeks. AFV is vital in many ways, such as protecting the fetus from trauma and infection, cushion- ing the umbilical cord and placenta from compression, allowing fetal movement, providing a supportive medium for growth, and serving as a reservoir of fluid and nutrients.48 Oligohydramnios is a condi- tion arising from having a too-low AFV than expected for gestational age, affecting approximately 3% to 5% of pregnancies. The concern can occur at any time during pregnancy but more commonly arises in the final trimester and can particularly complicate pregnancies that are postterm. In less than half of cases, the diagnosis is made in the absence of maternal-fetal risk factors and is therefore defined as iso- lated oligohydramnios (IO).48 Emerging evidence suggests increasing maternal hydration may be a simple, well-tolerated, and useful strategy to improve AFV in many cases of IO.49 Insufficient hydration during pregnancy can lead to constipation, hemorrhoids, edema, muscle cramps, temperature dysregulation (often referred to as “maternal overheating”), cystitis, urinary tract infections, fatigue, low AFV, and preterm labor. Breastfeeding women are commonly advised to increase their fluid intake in the hope that this may improve breast milk production. Fluid balance continues to be a challenge for nursing mothers, who lose an additional ∼ 700 mL of water per day via breast milk at 8 weeks post- partum.50 Whether or not additional fluid intake for nursing mothers, beyond what is required to meet physiological needs, increases breast milk supply, however, remains unknown due to a lack of well-con- ducted trials.51 Health authorities such as the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), Office on Women’s Health, and European Food Safety Authority state that the requirements for total water intake (TWI, originating from both food moisture and bever- age fluid) are increased during pregnancy and breastfeeding.52 It is recommended that pregnant women approximate 2300 mL per day TWI. This total is equivalent to 10 eight-ounce glasses of water per day. Breastfeeding women are asked to increase this by an extra 700 mL per day, thereby consuming 3000 mL per day TWI.53 Women may consider establishing healthy preconception hydra- tion habits. Pregnant women should be encouraged to consume fluids at routine intervals throughout the day and not wait for the feeling of thirst and risk of dehydration. Maternal hydration is, of course, further augmented to account for water loss due to perspiration as a result of exercising or being in a hot/humid environment or having a fever and water loss due to diarrhea or vomiting as a result of “morning sickness” and hyperemesis gravidarum. It is strongly recommended to consider the source of drinking water, given the extensive level of water-supply contamination worldwide, and only consume purified water (e.g., using a carbon block filter or the more expensive reverse-osmosis filtration if arsenic or fluoride is elevated) in order to minimize maternal and fetal exposure to tap-water toxicants that may be endemic to a local area.

## Healthy Weight

Over the past several decades, with the global nutrition transition,54 obesity among women of reproductive age has become a serious and growing public health concern. Although historically associated with affluence and high-resource countries, the increase in obesity is now also being seen in low-income populations. The prevalence of obesity across low- and middle-income countries varies from 3.4% to 73.7%.55

## 1718SECTION 6 Diseases

Excessive maternal GWG (the amount of weight a pregnant woman gains between the time of conception and the onset of labor) contrib- utes to the global obesity epidemic, given that fetal development and epigenetics are influenced by the metabolic and hormonal milieu of the intrauterine environment, which is shaped by maternal weight sta- tus and driven in part by physical activity and dietary factors.56 In the United States, based on the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of obesity in women of reproductive age is 31.8% and increases to 58% when the overweight and obese categories are combined.57 Using data from the revised birth certificate for 48 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City, the Centers for Disease Control examined 2011–2015 National Vital Statistics System natality data, which included prepreg- nancy BMI. The analysis found the overall prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight in 2015 to be 45%. Among 38 jurisdictions, the prev- alence of prepregnancy normal weight declined by 5%, whereas the prevalence of overweight increased by 2%, and the prevalence of obe- sity (all classes) increased by 8%.58 A woman’s prepregnancy weight is one of the most important indi- cators and modifiable risk factors affecting a healthy pregnancy. To improve maternal health and neonatal birth outcomes, women should ideally be within a normal BMI range when they conceive and should also gain weight within the ranges established by the NAM. GWG recommendations aim to optimize positive pregnancy outcomes for mothers and infants across whole populations. In today’s obesogenic environment, however, a majority of women are anticipated to have difficulty limiting weight gain to the upper limit of the guidelines. Approximately 40% to 70% of women gain in excess of the NAM guidelines during pregnancy, with those most at risk being already overweight or obese at conception.59 In the first trimester (initial 12 weeks of gestation), GWG is typi- cally less than 2 kg. Although the rate of GWG may vary during sub- sequent trimesters, it is normal to gain some weight during pregnancy to meet the needs of a growing baby, with most GWG occurring after 20 weeks’ gestation, and GWG should take into account prepregnancy BMI. Overall healthy weight gain represents many components during pregnancy. For example, if a baby’s birth weight is 3.5 kg and a mother gained 12.8 kg during pregnancy, the breakdown is as follows: amni- otic fluid (0.9 kg), placenta (0.7 kg), growth of womb (0.9 kg), growth of breasts (1.1 kg), increased blood volume (1.5 kg), increased body fluids (1.1 kg), storing of nutrients as fat and protein (3.1 kg).60 GWG goals vary according to preconception BMI, and women who meet GWG goals have more positive pregnancy outcomes. According to the most recent revision (May 2009) of the NAM guidelines for GWG, women who are underweight at the beginning of pregnancy (BMI <18.5) should try to gain 12.5 to 18 kg, women who are normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9) should gain 11.5 to 16 kg, overweight women (BMI 25.0–29.9) should gain 7 to 11.5 kg, and women who are obese (BMI ≥ 30.0) should gain only 5 to 9 kg during pregnancy (Table 211.1). Research demonstrates an association between prepregnancy over- weight and obesity with excessive GWG, thereby increasing the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including GDM, hyperten- sion, preeclampsia, postpartum weight retention, premature rupture of membranes, fetal growth abnormalities, macrosomia, birth defects, CS delivery, spontaneous miscarriage, and stillbirth.28,57,61–63 Similarly, maternal underweight is associated with poor perinatal outcomes, including increased risk of intrauterine growth restriction, SGA infants, low birth weight, and PTB.61,64 Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of overweight and obe- sity in women of reproductive age and the well-established negative effects of poor weight status that lead to adverse maternal and birth outcomes, preconception and early pregnancy offer an ideal opportu- nity to counsel women so that they can enter pregnancy in as optimal a state of health as possible. Attenuating unhealthy pregnancy weight gain may be accomplished by way of health care provider discussion and education about maternal and fetal risks associated with over- weight, obesity, and excessive GWG, as well as receiving personalized treatment with respect to effective behavior and lifestyle modifications, physical activity recommendations, and positive dietary interventions to improve and support healthy maternal weight.

## Physical Activity

Regular physical activity in all phases of life promotes optimal health. Despite pregnancy being associated with profound anatomic and physiological changes, it is an ideal time for maintaining or adopting a healthy lifestyle, given physical activity has minimal risks and has been shown to benefit most pregnant women.65 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) provides examples of safe physical activities that women with uncom- plicated pregnancies may initiate or continue, including walking, swimming, stationary cycling, and low-impact aerobics; running, rac- quet sports, and strength training (in consultation with an obstetric care provider); and yoga and Pilates (modified). Commonsense activ- ities to avoid while pregnant include hot yoga, contact sports, scuba diving, sky diving, and athletic activities with a high risk of falling (e.g., downhill and Nordic skiing, water skiing, surfing, mountain biking, and horseback riding).65 Precautions to be aware of when pregnant include avoiding exertion at altitudes greater than 1600 m,66 avoiding the supine position after the first trimester, and staying well hydrated. Signs and symptoms of when to stop exercising include dizziness,

vaginal bleeding, decreased fetal movement, lower extremity pain or swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea before physical activity, leakage of amniotic fluid, and preterm labor.67 There are sev- eral absolute and relative contraindications to aerobic exercise during pregnancy that women need to be aware of. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently released a revised edition (November 2018) of the Physical Activity Guidelines (PAG) for Americans. The PAG Advisory Committee concluded that pregnant women benefit from engaging in a physical activity program that leads to an eventual goal of moderate-intensity exercise for 30 minutes per day on most or all days of the week— resulting in at least 150 minutes per week—and adjusted as medically indicated.68 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials, involving 5075 pregnant women, sought to evaluate the effect of exercise on the risk of gestational hypertensive disorders. Compared with control participants, women randomized to aerobic exercise for 30 to minutes, two to seven times per week, had a significantly lower incidence of gestational hypertension (2.5% vs. 4.6%; relative risk [RR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40–0.74; 16 studies, 4641 participants). The occurrence of preeclampsia was similar in both groups. The incidence of CS delivery was decreased by 16% in the exercise group.69 Other studies have also suggested that regular physical activity may shorten the duration of labor and reduce the risk of CS and operative-assisted vaginal delivery.67 A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (1439 participants) found that physical exercise interventions reduced GWG and the risk of GDM for overweight and obese pregnant women. There were no significant differences in additional outcomes, includ- ing gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, birth weight, fetal growth abnormalities, macrosomia, CS delivery, and PTB.70 No evidence was shown with regard to benefit and/or harm for infants. Psychological benefits of physical activity during pregnancy include reduced fatigue, stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improved well-being.71 A prospective randomized clinical trial (300 singleton women, >18 years of age, at 10 weeks’ gestation and a mean prepregnancy BMI of 26.78 ± 2.75 kg/m2) assessed whether exercise during pregnancy may prevent GDM and improve pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women. Participants assigned to the exercise group followed a cycling program initiated within 3 days of randomization until 37 weeks’ gestation, which involved 30-minute sessions, three times per week, with a perceived exertion rating between 12 and 14. Women assigned to the control group continued their usual daily activities. Cycling exercise initiated early in pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of GDM and less GWG before the mid-second trimes- ter. All other secondary outcomes were also lower in the exercise group compared with control but without significant differences.72 A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized con- trolled trials (1502 participants) assessed exercise during pregnancy and the risk of PTB in overweight and obese women with a singleton pregnancy. Compared with controls, women who were randomized in early pregnancy to aerobic exercise for 30 to 60 minutes, three to seven times per week, had a lower percentage of PTB at less than 37 weeks (RR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41–0.95) and a lower incidence of GDM (RR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41–0.90). The gestational age at delivery and incidence of CS delivery were similar in both groups, and no differences in birth weight, macrosomia, and stillbirth were found between the interven- tion and sedentary control groups.73 Combining regular exercise and pregnancy benefits both mother and infant. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength-conditioning exercises before, during, and after pregnancy.65

## Sleep

Pregnancy is associated with numerous and dramatic physiological and anatomical changes in a relatively short period of time, predis- posing a majority of women to develop sleep disturbances and sleep disorders or unmasking underlying preexisting sleep conditions. Many pregnancy-related factors can result in inadequate sleep, and a growing body of research demonstrates maternal sleep–wake disturbances are predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In a study seeking to characterize sleep patterns and sleep disorders during pregnancy, 2427 participants completed an Internet-based sur- vey that included multiple screening scales: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 36 Health Survey, Insomnia Severity Index, Berlin Questionnaire, International Restless Legs Syndrome questions set, and a short ver- sion of the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory. Through all trimesters, women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient sleep (38%), and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent awakenings (100%), and others reported insomnia (57%), restless legs syndrome (24%), and sleep-disordered breathing (19%).74 Pregnancy-related symptoms tend to arise and predominate in one or another trimester, with disrupted sleep more prevalent and severe in the last 8 weeks of gestation, making it very challenging to achieve consistent and restorative sleep throughout a pregnancy. These symp- toms include nausea and vomiting, indigestion and acid reflux, fre- quent urination, discomfort from fetal movements, Braxton–Hicks contractions, anxiety, difficulty in assuming usual and comfortable sleep positions, low back pain, muscle cramps, restless legs syndrome, and sleep-disordered breathing.

## Sleep-Disordered Breathing

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is characterized by abnormalities of respiration during sleep, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and is highly prevalent in pregnant women. Systematic reviews, meta-anal- yses, and large cohort studies demonstrate that moderate to severe SDB can be significantly associated with the development of many adverse maternal, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes, including pregnancy-in- duced hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, longer labor induction, increased incidence of cesarean sections, longer hospital stay, increased odds for admission to intensive care unit, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and preterm delivery.75–78 A recent observational, case-control study, involving participants from an original cohort of 3,160,268 women in California between and 2012, sought to determine the effects of insomnia during pregnancy by separating the effects of sleep disturbance from other factors that also contribute to the risk of preterm birth. Among the women with a diag- nosed sleep disorder (2265 participants), more than 30% had insomnia, 56.9% had sleep apnea, 7.5% had a sleep-related movement disorder, and 5.4% had another sleep disorder. The prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks’ gestation) was 10.9% in the matched referent group (2172 participants) compared with 14.6% among women with a diag- nosed sleep disorder. The odds of early preterm birth (before 34 weeks’ gestation) was more than double for women with sleep apnea [odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5–3.1] and almost double for women with insomnia [OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6]. The odds of preterm birth were not significantly increased for sleep- related movement disorders.79

## Restless Leg Syndrome

Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor phenomenon char- acterized by an urge to move the legs because of an unpleasant sen- sation, which is worse during the evening or at night.80 There is a threefold-greater prevalence of RLS among parous women compared with nulliparous, with symptoms tending to occur most frequently

## 1720SECTION 6 Diseases

and strongly during the third trimester and usually subsiding after delivery.81 Present understanding suggests the high prevalence of RLS during pregnancy may be attributed to several factors, including hemodynamic and hormonal changes, childhood and family history; psychomotor behaviors; and maternal iron, folate, and/or vitamin D deficiency.82 In a cohort of 1563 women in their third trimester, recruited from prenatal clinics at the University of Michigan between March 2007 and December 2010, 36% had RLS as diagnosed by standard International RLS Study Group criteria. And 50% of these women had moderate to severe symptoms and were more than twice as likely to experience sleep–wake disturbances of poor sleep quality, poor daytime func- tion, and excessive daytime sleepiness in a dose–response relationship compared with pregnant women without RLS. There were no asso- ciations between RLS status and adverse delivery outcomes.83 Other studies have found RLS to be associated with a higher prevalence of preeclampsia, low birth weight, and preterm birth and an increased incidence of CSs.84–87 Considering that women experience significant sleep disruption, high prevalence of symptoms, and sleep disorders throughout preg- nancy, screening for sleep disturbances and implementing treatment via nonpharmacological interventions can play an important role in limiting adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

## Substance Use

Substance use is a significant, preventable public health issue and contributor to the global burden of disease, and women are the most vulnerable in their reproductive years. Risk factors for problematic substance use in pregnancy include past alcohol, nicotine, or illicit drug use; unintended pregnancy; lower education level; unemploy- ment; younger age; childhood trauma; intimate partner violence; comorbid physical and mental health problems; and lack of knowledge regarding the effect of substances on fetal development.88

<!-- chunk -->

## Alcohol

Alcohol use prenatally and during pregnancy remains a widespread problem, with in utero exposure to this well-established teratogen being correlated to neonatal birth defects, fetal alcohol spectrum dis- orders (FASDs), and lifelong developmental disabilities. Worldwide, FASDs are the leading known form of preventable birth defects and developmental, behavioral, and learning disabilities. According to the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2011–2013), among pregnant women, 1 in 10 reported alcohol use, and 1 in 33 reported binge drinking. The highest prevalence of any alcohol use was among those who were 35 to 44 years old, not married, and college graduates. Of those who reported binge drinking (defined as ≥ 4 drinks on the same occasion within the past 30 days), pregnant women reported an average of 4.6 binge-drinking episodes, which was higher than the average 3.1 binge-drinking episodes reported by non- pregnant women.89 Social factors such as being single or divorced and intimate partner violence victimization before and after recognition of pregnancy are associated with alcohol consumption.90 There is no known safe amount of alcohol intake or safe time to drink alcohol during pregnancy. All types of alcohol are equally harm- ful to the growing fetus and can lead to FASDs. The same holds true for women trying to conceive. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analy- sis was conducted to ascertain the possible impact of preconception alcohol consumption on maternal and neonatal outcomes, and a nonsignificant 30% increase in spontaneous abortion was found (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.85–1.97).91 Prenatal alcohol exposure is correlated with growth restriction and birth defects and is the leading prevent- able cause of neurodevelopmental deficits in children in the United States, as a result of FASDs. Alcohol use in pregnancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, SGA infants, preterm delivery, and infant mortality, as well as other long-term negative childhood outcomes, including behavior problems and cognitive and motor deficits.88 Alcohol use, binge drinking, and drinking during pregnancy are increasing among young women in many countries.92 Moreover, globally, approximately 41% of all pregnancies are unintended and unplanned, which means many women use alcohol before they become aware of pregnancy,93 leading to an increased risk of involun- tary in utero exposure during the earliest weeks of pregnancy, when the fetal central nervous system development is most sensitive to alcohol’s effects. Although studies have shown that a positive pregnancy test may lead to abstaining from or a significant decrease in alcohol use in many women, the intervening lapse of time between that and conception is a critical period with respect to fetal susceptibility to alcohol exposure. Evidence supports the importance of including the preconception period in the definition of drinking patterns during pregnancy94 and promoting early pregnancy awareness95 in order to influence the risk and rate of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEPs). Clinical trials investigating preconception behavior modification and counseling interventions have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in reducing AEPs.91,96,97

## Caffeine

Throughout the world, caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance, being a central nervous system stimulant. It occurs natu- rally or is added to medications, foods, and beverages, with coffee, tea, cola soft drinks, and cocoa being the major dietary sources of caffeine commonly consumed. A cup of instant coffee can contain 50 to 80 mg of caffeine per 350-mL (12-oz) serving, whereas commercially brewed coffee typically contains greater than 150 mg of caffeine per serving. Caffeine-containing teas (black tea and green tea) and soft drinks (colas and iced tea) contain less than 50 mg of caffeine per 250-mL (8-oz) serving.1 Once ingested, caffeine is metabolized and rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, passing all biological membranes, including the pla- cental barrier, resulting in an accumulation of caffeine metabolites in the fetus.98 During pregnancy, caffeine metabolism is prolonged due to the rate of clearance significantly decreasing from the first to third trimester, resulting in the half-life of maternally ingested caffeine dou- bling, leading to greater exposure risk for the fetus.99 Although the precise mechanisms by which caffeine intake affects maternal, newborn, and child health are not fully understood, caf- feine exposure may lead to vasoconstriction of the uteroplacental cir- culation, thereby affecting fetal growth and development, resulting in neonatal adverse outcomes such as low birth weight and SGA infants, which have been well documented in epidemiological studies.100 Dose– response meta-analyses of prospective observational trials have found that a maternal caffeine intake level of high versus low or no intake is associated with a significantly increased risk of low birth weight, PTB in the first and second trimesters, and pregnancy loss.99,101–103 Moreover, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed prior findings (e.g., Tolstrup [2003]104) that high maternal preconception caf- feine intake of greater than 300 mg/day is significantly associated with an increased risk of subsequent spontaneous abortion by upward of 31%.91 A maximum level of caffeine intake for pregnant women, and those in the preconception period, has been stipulated by several authorities, including the WHO, European Food Safety Authority, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the recommendation is not to exceed 200 mg/day, based on the evidence regarding its adverse fetal and neonatal effects.105

## Cannabis

Cannabis sativa (marijuana) is the most commonly used recreational drug during pregnancy and among breastfeeding women, with self-reported prevalence ranging from 2% to 5% in most studies and increasing to 15% to 28% depending on the demographics of the population being studied.106 A cross-sectional study of 3207 respon- dents from the 2014–2015 Colorado Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which features state-developed questions on cannabis use, evaluated estimates of prenatal and early postnatal can- nabis use in a state with legalized medical and recreational canna- bis and the association with adverse neonatal outcomes. The study found that the prevalence of cannabis use in Colorado was 5.7% during pregnancy and 5% (95% CI, 4.1%–6.2%) among women who were breastfeeding. Prenatal cannabis use was associated with a 50% increased risk of low birth weight independent of maternal age, race/ethnicity, level of education, and tobacco use during pregnancy, and of the women who used cannabis during pregnancy, 88.6% also breastfed.107 Furthermore, studies report that many women perceive can- nabis use to be relatively safe during pregnancy.108 Using data from the 2007–2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health—a cross- sectional nationally representative survey including pregnant (4971 participants) and nonpregnant (88,402) women 18 to 44 years of age— researchers found that approximately 70% of both pregnant and non- pregnant women believe there is slight or no risk of harm from using cannabis once or twice a week.109 The psychoactive and medicinal properties of cannabis are mediated by cannabinoids, which are highly lipophilic mole- cules and readily cross the placental and blood–brain barriers. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two major active cannabinoid constituents (see Chapter 61, Cannabis (Marijuana) and Cannabinoids, for a more complete discussion). Cannabinoids and their metabolites have been detected in many human tissues, including the placenta, as well as amniotic fluid and breast milk, with concentrations found to be several times higher in fetal tissue and breast milk than maternal plasma, depending on cannabis potency, duration of use, and method of consumption.110 Studies have documented the transfer of measurable levels of major metabolite delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ 9-THC) in the majority of breast milk samples and for up to 6 days after the last-reported maternal cannabis use.111 A pilot pharmacokinetic study demon- strated that following a standardized maternal dose of inhaled can- nabis, Δ 9-THC was transferred into the mother’s milk such that an exclusively breastfeeding infant ingests an estimated mean 2.5% (range 0.4%–8.7%) of the maternal dose.112 A growing body of research is assessing the effects and impact of cannabis use during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal, and childhood health. Recent studies suggest that in utero cannabis exposure affects fetal development and is associated with increased risk for adverse out- comes, including low birth weight, SGA infants, intrauterine growth restriction, reduced head circumference, preterm labor, stillbirth, and increased neonatal intensive care admission.88,113 There is limited to no evidence of any statistically significant asso- ciations between cannabis use and adverse maternal events (e.g., gesta- tional diabetes, preeclampsia, placental abruption).113–115 Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) is the most commonly experienced symptom in early pregnancy. NVP typically occurs during the first trimester but can persist to 20 weeks’ gestation in up to 20% of pregnancies.116 A meta-analysis of the reported prevalence of NVP in the United States found a mean rate of 68.6%, which is similar to that found in other countries.117 One of the primary medicinal uses of cannabis is as an antiemetic. In a large, diverse cohort study, pregnant women (220,510 partici- pants) in their first trimester underwent universal cannabis screening between 2009 and 2016 as part of standard prenatal care within a single health care system in California. Participants completed a substance use questionnaire and urine toxicology test at approximately 8 weeks’ gestation. The prevalence of severe NVP was 2.3%, and the prevalence of mild NVP was 15.3%. The study found that those women with severe NVP had 3.8 times greater odds, and those with mild NVP had 2.37 times greater odds, of prenatal cannabis use than pregnant women without NVP.118 The only other study to investigate whether women with NVP have an increased prevalence of cannabis use involved 4735 pregnant women in the Hawaii Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data representing all live births between and 2011. This epidemiological study found that 6.0% of participants used cannabis in the month before pregnancy, and 2.6% used canna- bis during pregnancy. Severe NVP was experienced by 21.2% of the sample population. Self-reported cannabis use was significantly more prevalent during pregnancy among women with severe NVP (3.7%) compared with those without NVP (2.3%).119 With widespread and growing use of cannabis during pregnancy and breastfeeding, accompanied by evolving policies regarding legalization and increased access in many countries, further research and long-term follow-up data are needed in order to (1) understand the safety and potential impact on infants exposed to varying amounts of cannabis via human milk, coupled with concerns over potential negative neurode- velopment outcomes from in utero exposure, and (2) establish guide- lines to better counsel women regarding consideration of anticipated risks and birth outcomes. In the meantime, a 2017 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee opinion and a 2018 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada statement recommend that all pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and those contemplat- ing pregnancy should be counseled and encouraged to discontinue use of cannabis for both recreational and medicinal purposes.106,120

## Tobacco

Tobacco use is a significant global public health concern that is directly correlated to a litany of diseases and total mortality. A recent Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study estimates that tobacco smoking and exposure to passive smoking accounted for more than 6.1 million deaths worldwide in 2013.121 In the United States alone, firsthand or mainstream smoke (which is directly inhaled by the user) is the leading cause of preventable dis- ease and risk for death from all causes in men and women, account- ing for nearly 1 in 5 deaths every year (480,000 deaths per year).122 Secondhand or sidestream (passive) smoke (which is released from the burning source of a cigarette, cigar, pipe, hookah, or vaping device and that which is exhaled by the user) contains more than 7000 chemicals, hundreds of which are known toxins and more than 70 of which are identified carcinogens. There is no risk-free level of exposure to sec- ondhand smoke during pregnancy.122 Thus, in addition to the alkaloid nicotine, the primary addictive agent in firsthand tobacco smoke, a plethora of toxins and carcinogens from maternal smoking and sec- ondhand smoke exposure readily pass to the developing fetus via the placenta, where concentrations can exceed those in the mother. Recent studies have found that a growing number of women view electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDSs), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes or vaping devices, to be a safer alternative to cigarettes during pregnancy.123,124 However, with the current lack of research on the safety and efficacy of ENDS use in pregnancy,125 the World Health Organization cautions pregnant women against using ENDSs because of the potential risk to fetal development and adverse birth outcomes from nicotine exposure in the same manner as smoking cigarettes.126

A recent population-based, longitudinal cohort study conducted in the United States in 2013–2014 among 5105 participants found that ENDS use results in measurable exposure to nicotine and known tobacco-re- lated toxicants, although at lower levels than cigarette smoking.127 During preconception and pregnancy, smoking tobacco remains one of the leading modifiable risk factors for preventable causes of multiple adverse neonatal morbidity and mortality outcomes, includ- ing significantly increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction, premature rupture of membranes, placenta previa, placental abruption, preterm delivery, SGA infants, low birth weight, miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital malformations (e.g., orofacial clefts), and sudden infant death syndrome.128–136 Smoking during pregnancy is estimated to result in more than 1000 infant deaths annually in the United States.122 Additionally, maternal exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke during pregnancy is significantly associated with detri- mental effects on the fetus, including impaired fetal growth, low birth weight, preterm delivery, and stillbirth.137,138 A recent meta-analysis found that cigarette smoking also impairs female reproductive potential and clinical outcomes of assisted repro- ductive technologies. This study reported a significant decrease in the live birth rate per cycle, a lower clinical pregnancy rate per cycle, and an increase in spontaneous miscarriage rate for patients who smoke.139 Despite over two decades of incontrovertible evidence that mater- nal smoking and secondhand smoke exposure are associated with detrimental perinatal outcomes and increased neonatal morbidity and mortality, national health surveys and epidemiological studies continue to find that many women continue to smoke during preg- nancy. In February 2018 the CDC presented the first national data with respect to the prevalence of cigarette smoking at any time during pregnancy among women who gave birth in 2016 in the United States. The report found that 1 in 14 women (7.2%) reported smoking during pregnancy, with the highest prevalence occurring among mothers aged 20 to 24 (10.7%) and then declining with increasing maternal age, with 2.0% among those aged 45 and over. Compared with the nation over- all, the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was lower in 19 states and the District of Columbia and higher in 31 states.140 Smoking is a modifiable behavior, and clinical trials demonstrate the effectiveness of cessation and psychosocial intervention programs in preconception and all stages of pregnancy, resulting in improved birth outcomes and reduction in intensive care unit admissions.128,141 Healthcare providers should thus routinely screen all pregnant women about their tobacco use (past and present) and exposure to secondhand smoke. Risks of firsthand and secondhand smoke exposure should be discussed and tobacco cessation intervention options offered to all pregnant women and those planning to conceive and their partners, whether they are current tobacco users, recent quitters, or nonsmokers.1

## Environmental Toxin Exposure

A rapidly evolving body of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrates disconcerting verification regarding the profound impact that pre- natal and gestational environmental toxin exposure has on human reproductive health and development. The associated adverse health outcomes of these voluntary and involuntary exposures are of great concern in women of childbearing age, in whom the exposure has the potential of inflicting harm in utero.105 A 2013 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee Opinion (reaffirmed in 2018) recognizes that exposure to both persistent organic pollutants and nonpersistent environmental tox- icants in the air, water, and soil and in food and in consumer products is ubiquitous during a sensitive period of fetal development and that maternal exposure to these pollutants has a profound adverse and lasting effect on reproductive health across the life course.142 Indeed, an analysis of the data from the CDC-conducted 2003–2004 NHANES that inves- tigated 163 chemical analytes in 12 chemical classes in subsamples of 268 pregnant women (a nationally representative sample population in the United States) found detectable levels in 8 of 12 classes of chemicals in 100% of pregnant women. These included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, perfluorocarbons, phenols, polybro- minated diphenyl ethers, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and perchlorate. Across chemical classes, the median number detected ranged from 8 of 17 chemical analytes to 50 of 71 chemical analytes.143 Although very likely a substantial underestimation, reports suggest approximately 3% of fetal developmental defects are attributable to parental chemical exposures.144 Prenatal and gestational exposure to environmental chemicals and toxic metals has been associated with a range of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and childhood health consequences, such as spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birth weight, SGA infants, congenital anomalies, impaired cognitive devel- opment, intellectual impairment, impaired neurodevelopment, and childhood cancer145 (Table 211.2). Various toxic chemicals and metals in pregnant women can readily cross the placenta, and in some cases, such as with methylmercury, they can accumulate in the fetus, resulting in higher fetal exposure than mater- nal exposure.142 Methylmercury and PCBs are also present in the breast milk of lactating mothers. Mercury is ubiquitously found in all human populations that have been tested, with seafood consumption and den- tal amalgams being the primary sources of exposure, whereas the main source of PCBs is fish that are farmed or taken from bodies of water with accumulated industrial runoff, such as some lakes and the Baltic Ocean. Prenatal exposure to methylmercury has been directly linked to ongoing neurobehavioral and neurocognitive deficits in offspring, and the disease associations for PCBs range from breast cancer to rheumatoid arthritis.146 Underlying biological mechanisms associated with environmen- tal chemical exposure during sensitive windows of in utero develop- ment include mutagenesis, mitochondrial electron chain decoupling, epigenetic changes, and endocrine disruption. Mutagens affect DNA directly, whereas epigenetic mechanisms modulate gene expression that is integral to orchestrating human development without changing DNA sequences.142 A heterogeneous group of environmental toxins titled endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been defined by the Endocrine Society as exogenous agents that interfere with the synthe- sis, secretion, transport, metabolism, binding action, or elimination of natural bloodborne hormones present in the body and responsible for homeostasis and reproduction and developmental processes.147 Given that hormonal regulation is critical to human reproduction, EDCs pose a significant burden and public health concern, having been implicated in a wide range of adverse health effects. Before the Endocrine Society published its 2014 executive summary regarding the known health impacts of EDCs, the WHO and United Nations Environment Programme launched a joint 2012 assessment report on the global status of scientific knowledge on exposure to and effects of EDCs, including the development of diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, infertility, female and male reproductive disorders, and hormone-sensitive cancers in women.147,148 EDCs have also been associated with various adverse birth outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, PTB, SGA infants, and congenital anomalies. EDCs include biologically persistent organic pol- lutants, including chlorinated pesticides, PCBs, and dioxins, as well as nonpersistent plastic compounds such as bisphenol A and phthalates, organophosphate pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides.146 A primary example of a prevalent EDC is bisphenol A (BPA), a high- volume (>10 billion pounds produced per year) industrial chemical for polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins. It is widely found in household items and consumer products, including plastic food and beverage contain- ers, inner coatings of cans and jar lids, reusable water bottles, plastic toys,

The 2003–2004 NHANES conducted by the CDC found detectable levels of BPA in 93% of urine samples (2517 participants) from people 6 years of age and older.149 The CDC NHANES data are considered representative of exposures in the United States and thus demonstrate the ubiquitous nature of BPA exposure. In February 2018 the European Commission updated its regula- tions concerning the use of BPA, and the provisions in the law became effective in September 2018.150 The new rules are intended to tighten restrictions on the use of BPA in food contact materials and better pro- tect children under the age of 3 years old by extending the ban on the use of BPA to include, in addition to infant feeding bottles, drinking cups or bottles intended for infants and young children. The strengthened regulation lowers the specific migration limit, which is the amount of substance that can migrate from food contact materials (FCMs) into the food, by twelvefold, taking the allowable limit from 0.6 mg BPA per kg of food to 0.05 mg/kg. Denmark and Belgium entirely banned the use of BPA in FCMs for infants and young children. Sweden and France have banned the use of BPA in coatings and varnishes in FCMs intended for infants and young children. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicity Program convened the Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on Bisphenol A Toxicity (Clarity-BPA) in February 2012. Despite the results of the Clarity-BPA Core Study Report (released in September 2018) show- ing that BPA exposure, in the animal model used, can cause adverse health effects at low doses, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asserted that BPA causes “minimal” health effects and is safe for currently authorized uses in food containers and packaging. Elevated BPA levels have been associated with recurrent miscarriages, decreased number of oocytes retrieved in in vitro fertilization, fetuses with an abnormal karyotype, and chromosomal abnormalities.146 A retrospective cohort study found that maternal conjugated BPA (cBPA) was associated with a higher risk of first-trimester miscarriage. Of the 115 participants seeking treatment for infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss at the Stanford Fertility Reproductive Medicine Clinic, there were 47 live births and 68 clinical miscarriages (46 aneuploid, euploid). Stored serum samples from 4 to 5 weeks’ gestation were ana- lyzed for cBPA concentration. Median serum cBPA levels were higher in women who miscarried (0.101 ng/mL) compared with women who had live birth (0.075 ng/mL; P = 0.014). Women with a cBPA level in the highest quartile demonstrated an 83% greater risk of experiencing a first-trimester miscarriage than women with a cBPA level in the low- est quartile.151 Prenatal exposure to environmental toxins is linked to wide-rang- ing adverse health consequences that can manifest across the life span and potentially be transmitted to the next generation.152 A sig- nificant step toward improving fetal health and pregnancy outcomes should involve preconception counseling that consists of (1) taking a detailed history to identify potential sources of toxicant exposure, (2) raising awareness and informing women of childbearing age about the adverse effects of such exposures, (3) assisting in the identifica- tion of chemical exposures, and (4) providing practical lifestyle mod- ifications for toxicant avoidance and removal strategies. Presently, available toxicant and toxicant metabolite testing can assist in iden- tifying exposure to certain compounds that a woman should avoid (Table 211.3).

## Mind–Body Medicine

A woman’s mental and emotional health during pregnancy and post- natally are of primary importance to the well-being of both the mother and her child, given that it is a time of rapid and sweeping transition in a woman’s life, encompassing biological, physical, psychological, and social changes. And although many women welcome the challenges of childbirth, others may feel a significant amount of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression with pregnancy. Prevalence estimates suggest that at least 10% of pregnant women experience perinatal anxiety and

that upward of 20% are affected by depression during pregnancy and are equally likely to suffer from postpartum depression.153,154 A growing body of evidence associates both depression and anxiety in pregnancy with an increase in obstetric complications and adverse neonatal outcomes, including PTB, low birth weight, and small fetal head size, which are themselves linked to increased risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity and neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as impaired language development and behavioral and cognitive prob- lems later in life.155–161 Reducing maternal stress, anxiety, and depression has been found to result in healthy delivery at term.162,163 However, up to 10% of women are exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy,164 and clinical studies demonstrate that prescribed antidepressant medication carries a significant risk of adverse neona- tal outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, decreased gestational length, low Apgar scores, congenital anomalies, persistent pulmonary hypertension, respiratory distress, convulsions, and hypo- glycemia.165–167 Antidepressant exposure in utero affects birth and neonatal outcomes independently of antenatal maternal depression.168 A large, international, collaborative meta-analysis found a significantly increased risk for neonatal hospital readmission, major malformations, and infant morbidity due to in utero lithium exposure during the first trimester compared with unexposed babies.169 Therefore, in addition to preconception discussions with one’s healthcare provider regard- ing the appropriateness and potential risk of medication use in preg- nancy, interest in effective nonpharmacological mind–body medicine approaches has been gaining increasing attention for the treatment of anxiety and depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessed the effect of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on maternal perinatal mental health outcomes, including mindfulness-based stress reduc- tion, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and integrative mind- fulness yoga practice. Maternal MBI participation is associated with reductions in perinatal anxiety, perceived stress, and depression and increased mindfulness.154 The practice of MBI helps develop and sup- port abilities that are important for pregnant women by encouraging awareness and acceptance of one’s thoughts, emotions, and body sen- sations; reducing reactivity to uncomfortable experiences; and build- ing stress tolerance and resiliency.170

# DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION

## Prenatal Multivitamin

Adequate nutrition is particularly important during pregnancy because it not only maintains the health of the mother but also deter- mines the course of the pregnancy and its outcome, fetal development, and the child’s health after birth and later in life.171 A growing body of research finds, however, that a majority of women of reproductive age will not be nutritionally prepared for pregnancy because they do not meet even the lower Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) recommenda- tions.28 Prenatal multivitamin–mineral supplement recommendations are becoming an attractive option considered by international agen- cies, such as UNICEF, to improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, particularly in developing countries.172 Multiple micronu- trient deficiencies often coexist among women of reproductive age, particularly in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) but also in developed countries, and these are exacerbated during pregnancy due to increased physiological demands, whereupon such deficiencies can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal events.173 A Cochrane review evaluated the effects of multiple-micronutri- ent (MMN) supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. The study included 17 prospective, randomized, controlled trials (138,538 participants), with 15 of the trials conducted in LMICs and 2 carried out in the United Kingdom. Overall, pregnant women who received MMN supplementation (con- taining iron and folic acid) had reduced rates of low-birth-weight and SGA babies.173 An additional systematic review found similar find- ings, in that significant benefit was found with MMN supplementa- tion during pregnancy in reducing low birth weight and SGA.174 An earlier Cochrane review assessed a total of 40 randomized and quasi- randomized clinical trials comparing MMN supplementation during pregnancy with placebo, no vitamins, or other interventions. Included were studies that began MMN supplementation before conception, periconceptionally, or in early pregnancy (less than 20 weeks’ gesta- tion). The use of MMN supplementation (containing iron and folic acid) before pregnancy or in early pregnancy was found to decrease the risk for stillbirth (death of baby before 20 weeks’ gestation). No other significant findings were demonstrated with respect to maternal or fetal and neonatal outcomes.175 With heightening maternal awareness and scientific evidence demonstrating potential adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with respect to in utero toxicant exposures, increasing widespread attention is being paid to the natural products industry, good manufac- turing processes, and minimizing contamination, including toxic met- als within prenatal supplements. A 2018 study conducted in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, sought to evaluate toxic element contamination in 26 “commonly used prenatal vitamin brands including one prescrip- tion brand,” representing a sample of convenience using readily avail- able over-the-counter products collected from assorted retail outlets, including health food stores, pharmacies, and food retailers. In total, samples were sent to a laboratory for independent analysis. The findings revealed that all samples contained lead, with average amounts being 0.535 mcg per day, which is above the stringent Proposition 65 limits published in California (P65L) of 0.5 mcg/day for prenatal vitamins. Of the 26 products analyzed, 14 had higher-than-acceptable levels of lead, with one supplement yielding 4.0 mcg/day. All samples contained cad- mium but did not exceed P65L. Mercury was detected in all samples but did not exceed P65L of <0.3 mcg/day, with the highest level of exposure being 0.095 mcg/day. All samples contained arsenic, with an average exposure of 0.42 mcg/day. Four samples had >1.0 mcg/day exposure, and upon arsenic speciation subanalysis, three out of these four sam- ples contained toxic inorganic arsenic species >0.1 mcg/day, above the acceptable P65L, with one sample having 0.4 mcg/day of exposure. Aluminum, nickel, thallium, and titanium were detected in all samples but did not exceed P65L or U.S. Pharmacopeia limits. The authors con- cluded that cumulative daily intake of prenatal supplementation over many months may constitute a significant source of gestational toxic element exposure for both the mother and the developing fetus.176 Although daily prenatal supplementation is widely recommended before conception, through gestation, and during lactation for women in developed countries, such as the United States, Canada, and European countries, according to a 2017 Cochrane systematic review, there is currently insufficient high-quality evidence demonstrating their effect on pregnancy outcomes, and further research is required.173 In the United States, average daily intake guidelines for individual micronutrients and macronutrients have been established by the NAM for women of childbearing age and for pregnant and lactating women; these are referred to as Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs) (Tables 211.4 and 211.5).

catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Biotin has been found to have addi- tional roles in the regulation of gene expression, genome stability, and cell proliferation.177 Frank, symptomatic biotin deficiency is believed to be rare.178 However, evidence demonstrates that pregnancy is associated with an increased demand for biotin, and thus a marginal degree of biotin deficiency may occur in upward of 50% of pregnant women during normal gestation.179,180 The dietary requirement for biotin is currently unknown. The AI for healthy adults and pregnant women is μ g bio- tin per day, although preliminary research suggests an upward adjust- ment may be necessitated for pregnancy and lactation (AI μ g/day). The first human pregnancy trial controlling for dietary biotin intake and quantitating biotin content of the diet sought to assess the impact of reproductive state on biotin-status response. The study demon- strated significant alterations in biomarkers of biotin metabolism and deficiency during pregnancy and lactation and suggested that biotin intakes of greater than 2 to 3 times the current AI of 60 to μ g/day are likely needed to meet the demands of these reproductive states.177 Marginal biotin deficiency is teratogenic in mouse dam studies.181 However, further human clinical research is required to ascertain whether suboptimal biotin status spontaneously occurring in a sub- stantial proportion of pregnant women may have an impact on biotin supply to the developing fetus and confer an increased risk of poor neonatal outcomes.

## Calcium

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body, given its involve- ment in a multitude of fundamental functions, including muscle contraction, blood clotting, cell signaling, nerve conduction, insulin secretion, and maintenance of bone mineral density. During preg- nancy, physiological calcium absorption increases to meet fetal bone mineralization requirements, as well as during lactation to meet the demands of the developing infant. This upregulated calcium require- ment is related to transient maternal bone loss associated with childbearing. Randomized clinical trials suggest that calcium supple- mentation during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period may constitute a practical intervention for reducing bone resorption.182 Epidemiological data demonstrate an association between low dietary calcium intake and an increased incidence of preeclamp- sia, a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Preeclampsia is a risk factor for preterm birth. A recent Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis that included 13 randomized controlled trials involving 15,730 participants compared high-dose calcium ( ≥ 1000 mg/day) during pregnancy to placebo. The study found a significant reduction in both the average risk of high blood pressure and the risk of preeclampsia, particularly when calcium was taken in the second half of pregnancy. The treatment effect was largest for women having calcium-poor diets and those at higher risk of devel- oping preeclampsia. Both the composite outcome of maternal death or serious morbidity and the average risk of preterm birth were reduced with calcium supplementation.183 Limited evidence on low-dose cal- cium supplementation (<1000 mg/day, usually 500 mg/day) suggests a reduction in hypertension, preeclampsia, and admission to neonatal intensive care.183 Calcium supplementation prenatally or beginning in early preg- nancy and continued at least until mid-pregnancy has also been inves- tigated for its potential in preventing maternal hypertensive disorders. A Cochrane review did not identify any randomized controlled trials where calcium supplementation commenced prepregnancy; the review concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness or otherwise of pre- or early-pregnancy calcium supplementation for preventing hypertensive disorders.184 The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for calcium in pregnancy is the same as that of nonpregnant women of the same age (1000 mg/ day) because of the increased efficiency of calcium absorption during pregnancy and maternal bone calcium mobilization.185 Women with suboptimal dietary calcium intake (<500 mg/day) may need additional supplementation to meet both maternal requirements and fetal devel- opment needs.186

## Carnitine

Carnitine is a hydrophilic amino acid derivative that is critical for energy production, with a primary role in facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. Carnitine binds acyl residues and maintains homeostasis of coen- zyme-A. It also possesses antioxidant capacity, inhibits free-radi- cal production, and reduces oxidative stress. Carnitine is primarily sourced from dietary intake, with biosynthesis contributing approxi- mately 25% of circulating carnitine levels.187 Plasma carnitine concentration is substantially lower during pregnancy compared with nonpregnant women,188–190 and research demonstrates that normal pregnancy increases urinary loss of carnitine and significantly reduces free and total plasma carnitine concentra- tions. Total plasma carnitine levels in nonpregnant women of repro- ductive age average μ mol/L191; however, carnitine concentrations can decrease precipitously during gestation and at term can be as low as μ mol/L, a level also found in carnitine-deficient adults.192 Carnitine is the generic term for several compounds, including l-car- nitine, acetyl-l-carnitine, and propionyl-l-carnitine. A randomized, sin- gle-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that plasma carnitine reduction in pregnancy is safely prevented by supplementing with 500 mg of l-car- nitine l-tartrate from week 13 of gestation to term versus placebo.193 Lower levels of serum l-carnitine may be associated with obesity at term pregnancy. In a study of 118 healthy women with a single- ton pregnancy ( ≥ 37 weeks), women with a prepregnancy BMI ≥ 29.9 kg/m at term had significantly lower serum l-carnitine levels. Serum total l-carnitine levels correlated significantly and negatively with pre- pregnancy body weight, prepregnancy BMI, pregnancy bodyweight, pregnancy BMI, and serum triglyceride levels. The authors suggest that nutritional supplementation of l-carnitine can be offered to women who are overweight or obese prenatally or at the beginning of pregnancy.194 Elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids (PFFAs) are considered a main cause of insulin resistance and, consequently, type 2 diabetes. l-carnitine supplementation of 2 g per day, beginning in the 20th week of gestation, resulted in a significant decrease in PFFAs. An associated increase (five- to tenfold) was found in the relative mRNA abundances of enzymes involved in regulating fatty acid and glucose oxidation.195 l-carnitine supplementation may thus help prevent the development of gestational diabetes, especially in overweight women. Given that suboptimal carnitine levels may lead to complications associated with pregnancy, supplementation with l-carnitine through- out pregnancy may be advisable.196 Animal-derived foods that pro- vide carnitine-rich dietary sources (the active form in the body and found in food is l-carnitine) include red meat, dairy products, fish, and poultry. Because fruits, vegetables, and grains contain relatively little carnitine, vegans and vegetarians consume considerably less car- nitine (10–12 mg per day) versus adults who eat an omnivorous diet (60–180 mg per day)197 and may therefore consider taking an l-carni- tine dietary supplement.

## Carotenoids

Carotenoids are a family of naturally occurring fat-soluble pigments synthesized by plants, algae, and photosynthetic microorganisms.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1731CHAPTER 211 Preconception and Pregnancy Health

More than 700 carotenoids belonging to groups of carotenes (e.g., β -carotene, lycopene) have been identified, as well as their hydrox- ylated derivatives—xanthophylls (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxan- thin).171 Fruits and vegetables offer the majority of the approximately 50 carotenoids found in the human diet. However, 95% of carotenoids present in plasma and tissues are represented by only six such com- pounds: α -carotene, β -carotene, β -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.198 Some carotenoids can be converted to vitamin A, the most common example being β -carotene. However, surprisingly common SNP variants substantially decrease this conversion (see Chapter 125, Vitamin A, for a full discussion). This is of substantial significance for vegetarian and, especially, vegan pregnant women. The findings of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study confirm that plasma levels of carotenoids in pregnant women are a direct func- tion of their consumption of fruits and vegetables,199 and carotenoid status in the newborn depends on the nutritional status of the mother. The beneficial health effects of carotenoids are primarily attributed to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.200 Oxidative stress has been associated with adverse maternal and neona- tal outcomes, including preeclampsia, GDM, SGA infants, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and PTB.171 Increases in maternal serum concentration of lycopene have been associated with a decrease in rates of preeclampsia and IUGR. For example, a prospective, randomized controlled trial involving 251 pri- migravida women assessed the effect of 2 mg lycopene administered twice daily (116 participants) compared with placebo (115 partici- pants), beginning in the second trimester and followed until delivery, on the development of preeclampsia, mode of delivery, and fetal out- comes. Compared with the placebo group, the lycopene group devel- oped significantly less preeclampsia, mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower, mean fetal weight was significantly higher, and the mean incidence of IUGR was significantly lower.201 A 2018 cohort study of 180 maternal-infant dyads sought to inves- tigate associations between serum lycopene concentrations, including lycopene isomers, and maternal-newborn outcomes. The trial found that maternal serum concentrations of total lycopene and the cis-iso- form were positively associated with growth parameters in the new- born, including infant birth weight, length, and head circumference. Maternal concentrations of cis-lycopene were significantly lower in mothers whose infants developed respiratory distress syndrome and in mothers whose babies were admitted to the newborn intensive care unit compared with those who were not.202 Approximately 30% to 40% of preterm birth is due to premature rupture of membranes. Increased maternal serum concentrations of carotenoids ( α - and β -carotene, β -cryptoxanthin, and lycopene) are associated with decreased risk of premature birth.203 A higher risk of preterm birth has been observed in women with a lower intake of β -carotene.204 High maternal plasma concentrations of carotenoids ( β -carotenoid, lutein, zeaxanthin, α - and β -carotenoid) during preg- nancy decrease the risk of SGA infants and IUGR.205 Carotenoids are not considered essential nutrients at this time, so there is currently no dietary intake recommendation for pregnant and breastfeeding women. However, during pregnancy and lactation, diets rich in fruits and vegetables are highly recommended.

## Choline

Choline is an essential micronutrient that has far-reaching and diverse functions throughout the life span. Choline is primarily derived exogenously from dietary sources. Small amounts are endogenously synthesized via several metabolic pathways, primarily in the form of phosphatidylcholine; however, the amount is not sufficient to meet human requirements for the nutrient.206 With respect to one such hepatic pathway, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is estrogen dependent and thus exponentially upregulated and active during pregnancy, when estradiol concentrations can rise to approximately 60 times greater at term than those of nonpregnant women.207 A study using stable isotope methodology examined the effects of pregnancy on choline partitioning and metabolic activity of the PEMT pathway. Healthy women in their third trimester (26 par- ticipants, initially 27th week of gestation) and nonpregnant women (21 participants) consumed 22% of their total choline intake (480–930 mg/day) as a methyl-d9-choline for the final 6 weeks of a 12-week feeding study. Compared with the nonpregnant group, an incremental increase in the selective transfer of PEMT-derived phosphatidylcholine across the placenta and into the fetal compartment was demonstrated in pregnant women.208 The estrogen-regulated enhanced capacity for endogenous synthesis of choline demonstrates the importance of aug- menting choline production in order to meet the heightened require- ment for healthy fetal growth and development. Choline plays a central role in many biochemical processes, being metabolized into four key biological compounds: phosphatidylcho- line, acetylcholine, sphingomyelin, and betaine. For example, choline is fundamental to the formation and structural integrity of cell mem- branes and serves as a source of methyl groups, thereby supporting cellular methylation processes. As a substrate for acetylcholine, choline is critical to the production of this neurotransmitter and nonneuronal cell-signaling molecule necessary for memory, mood, muscle control, and other brain and nervous system functions.206 As such, choline and metabolites are in high demand during preg- nancy due to the increased rate of sequestration by the growing fetus. The rapid rate of cell division and stem-cell proliferation, expansion of the maternal kidneys and uterus, and growth of placental and fetal tis- sue, as well as increased lipoprotein requirements for nervous system development, all deplete maternal choline stores. Choline is transferred across the placenta against its concentration gradient, resulting in very high amounts in the fetal compartment to ensure enhanced availability. The choline concentration in amniotic fluid is tenfold greater than that present in maternal blood, and plasma/serum choline concentrations are six- to sevenfold higher in the fetus and newborn than in the adult.207 Choline deficiency during pregnancy can alter DNA methylation in the placenta and cord blood and has been associated with neural tube defects, cleft lip, hypospadias, cardiac defects, and suboptimal brain development of the fetus and in infants.209 Choline was recognized as an essential nutrient for public health by the NAM in 1998.210 Similarly, in 2016, the European Food Safety Authority set dietary recommendations for choline.211 In 2017 dele- gates at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association voted to pass a resolution in support of including the evidence-based amount of choline (450 mg) in all prenatal multivitamin supplements.212 However, this has yet to be widely implemented by natural prod- uct manufacturers, despite prevailing scientific evidence and clinical recognition of the essential role choline plays during pregnancy and lactation. There is significant variation in the dietary requirement for choline, due in part to common genetic polymorphisms, and the vast majority of women are not achieving the NAM-established AI)of 450 mg/day for all trimesters and 550 mg/day during lactation.213 An analysis from the NHANES (2005–2014 data sets for pregnant women) found that only 8.51% ± 2.89% of pregnant women in the United States meet the AI for choline.206 In other words, approximately 9 out of every 10 preg- nant women do not obtain the recommended daily amount of choline. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that the current AI for choline may be suboptimal to meet the significant demand during pregnancy and lactation. A small clinical trial sought to quantify the effects of pregnancy and maternal choline intake on maternal and fetal indicators of choline metabolism. Twenty-six healthy pregnant women

in their third trimester (27th week of gestation) and 21 nonpregnant control women (aged ≥ 21 years) were randomly assigned to receive either 480 mg or 930 mg choline per day for 12 weeks in conjunction with a highly controlled choline diet. Fasting blood samples, placental tissue, and umbilical cord venous blood were collected and tested for choline and its metabolites (betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, and methionine).214 The study found that (1) choline intake modifies both maternal and fetal biomarkers of choline metabolism, and (2) a higher dosage yields higher concentrations of choline and its metabolites in both pregnant and nonpregnant women, as well as neonates (i.e., led to a doubling of dimethylglycine in cord plasma), without changing obligatory maternal free choline urinary excretion. Therefore, more than doubling the choline AI does not exceed physiological needs, and thus 930 mg per day during pregnancy supports maternal and fetal single-carbon metabolism and methylation. Currently, prenatal multivitamin supplements typically contain lit- tle to no choline. A 2016 study found that none of the “top 25 prenatal multivitamins” contain the choline AI for pregnant women. Only two of the products contained 55 mg and 50 mg, respectively, and six oth- ers contained merely 30 mg or less.215 Therefore, to meet the high pre- and postnatal demands for choline, in addition to taking a prenatal supplement, pregnant and lactating women should include a daily sin- gle-nutrient choline supplement in order to obtain the minimum AI recommendation of 450 mg per day; dietary recommendations should also emphasize routine consumption of choline-rich dietary sources (Table 211.6).

## Folate

Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin occurring naturally in a wide variety of foods, as well as the synthetic form folic acid, which is used in forti- fied foods and some dietary supplements. Many essential cellular and metabolic pathways are dependent on folate as a single-carbon transfer source, including synthesis and maintenance of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), methylation of DNA (necessary for cell differentiation and epigenetic modulation), metabolism of amino acids, and the conver- sion of homocysteine to methionine.216 Folate status is thus crucial for placental and fetal growth and development, making maternal require- ments significantly greater than those of nonpregnant women. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord that occur in the first month of gestation. Spina bifida is the most commonly occurring NTD, followed by anenceph- aly, with encephalocele and iniencephaly being rare types. It has been established that maternal folate deficiency increases the risk of NTD occurrences. After decades of speculation regarding the role of folic acid in the prevention of NTDs, two randomized, double-blind, controlled trials published in the early 1990s217,218 concluded that supplementation with folic acid prevents the occurrence and recurrence of these mal- formations.219 The results of these and other studies prompted the U.S. Public Health Service to recommend, as a primary care–relevant preventive intervention, that all women capable of becoming preg- nant consume 400 mcg per day of folic acid to prevent NTDs. And in 1998 the FDA, Health Canada, and many other governmental public health agencies around the world began implementing policies requir- ing manufacturers to fortify foods with folic acid, including flours, enriched breads, cereals, rice, and other grain products, to reduce the risk of NTDs. Dramatic results of these established folic acid fortifi- cation programs have appeared, with decreases in the rates of NTDs and associated morbidity and mortality by 19% to 32% in the United States and by 19% to 55% in 70 other countries, including Canada, South Africa, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, since the initia- tion of mandatory food-supply fortification.220 However, more recent population-based studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses are beginning to suggest that the reduction in NTD rates by folic acid for- tification may be more modest than previously reported.219,221 It is now better understood that this shortfall in preventing NTDs via folic acid food fortification is due in part to epigenetic changes and several other factors that can lead to impaired maternal folate status. There are also key genetic polymorphisms that affect the conversion of

dietary and supplemental forms to the activated folates and compo- nents of folate-dependent pathways and metabolism, one of which is a very commonly expressed variant and has been directly associated with an increased susceptibility for NTDs. A comprehensive meta-analysis surveyed literature spanning from 1996 to 2011 and investigated the effects of five genetic variants from 47 study populations, for a total of 85 case-control comparisons. The study found a significant association between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T variant and increased risk for NTDs.222 Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that precon- ceptional folate supplementation is inversely associated with the risk of low birth weight, SGA infants, and PTB.223–225 Folic acid, found in fortified foods and many dietary supplements, must be converted into biologically active folate, of which there are primarily two forms: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), required in the methylation cycle, and folinic acid, a reduced folate that supports DNA synthesis, for example. SNPs in the genes that regulate folate metabolism can inhibit these folic acid–conversion processes. And as mentioned previously, the MTHFR 677CT SNP is strongly associated with NTD risk. Instead of supplying folinic acid, many professionally manufactured prenatal multivitamin–mineral supplements are now utilizing the biologically active form L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (e.g., Metafolin), which has several potential advantages: (1) bypasses gene mutations affecting folate metabolism, (2) may reduce risk of mask- ing vitamin B 12 deficiency, and (3) may reduce risk of interaction with drugs that inhibit folate metabolism.226 Clinical research demonstrates numerous populations of women who would likely benefit from a significantly higher daily dosage of folate/folic acid (4000–5000 mcg per day) before conception because of factors that individually contribute to insufficient folate status and/or folate defi- ciency. This includes women who have a history of a prior pregnancy with a NTD, a family history of NTD, a genetic mutation in folate metabolism, a history of taking anti-folate medications, a history of oral contraceptive use, a history of firsthand or secondhand cigarette smoke exposure, an elevated BMI of ≥ 30 (obesity), poorly controlled diabetes, or malabsorption syndrome (e.g., celiac disease or Crohn’s disease).219 Worldwide, folate deficiency is most commonly caused by a dietary insufficiency. A daily intake of 400 mcg folate or folinic acid is recom- mended for most healthy women of reproductive age,34,213 to be sus- tained for at least 6 months before conception to maintain minimally adequate folate status. Daily consumption of folate-rich dietary sources is encouraged, including dark-green leafy vegetables, cruciferous veg- etables (e.g., Brussels sprouts), citrus fruits, nuts, beans, peas, seafood, eggs, dairy products, meat, beef liver, grains, and fortified foods.216 The RDA for folate (as dietary folate equivalents) throughout preg- nancy is 600 mcg, and it is 500 mcg during lactation. However, there are several factors that may require an increased recommendation to as high as 4000 to 5000 mcg per day for pregnant women and those plan- ning to become pregnant. High-dose folate supplementation should not extend beyond the first trimester, and it is advisable that women consult with a knowledgeable health care provider during preconcep- tion and early pregnancy.

## Iodine

Iodine is an essential trace element and is found in every tissue in the body. The primary function of iodine is its role as an intrinsic com- ponent for the production of thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid hormones in turn play a critical role in fetal neurodevelopment and regulating a variety of metabolic processes that are important determinants of health throughout the life span. Pregnancy has a profound impact on thyroid gland function. The thyroid gland increases in size by 10% in iodine-replete individuals and by 20% to 40% in iodine-deficient populations. Production of T4 and T3 increases by approximately 50%, in conjunction with a sep- arate 50% increase in the daily iodine requirement.227 The maternal requirement for iodine is heightened during pregnancy due to several factors, including the need for increased T4 synthesis to maintain nor- mal metabolism and the transfer of T4 and iodide ion to the fetus.228 Sufficient iodine intake is thus necessary to support increased thy- roid functioning and physiological demand during pregnancy and lactation, making the mother and developing fetus vulnerable. The WHO established adequate intake and adequate iodine nutrition for pregnancy as having a median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of ≥ 150 mcg/L and defined mild to moderate iodine deficiency during pregnancy as a median UIC of 50 mcg/L to 150 mcg/L.229 Since 2000, UIC has been measured in the continuous NHANES. Over recent years, the median UIC for pregnant women in the United States sam- pled in NHANES has been trending below 150 mcg/L. The 2005–2010 survey data revealed a median UIC of 129 mcg/L, which is a decrease from the median UIC of 153 mcg/L per the 2001–2006 NHANES.228 The NHANES data also show that over 35% of pregnant women have moderately deficient iodine levels.230 Although most survey data suggest that the U.S. population is iodine sufficient, a comprehensive 2019 systematic review of the iodine status of women of reproductive age in the United States found emergent iodine deficiency in the population, indicating an alarming public health concern needing immediate attention. The authors also note that public awareness of the importance of iodine consumption, especially in the prenatal period and first trimester of pregnancy, is severely lacking.231 Moreover, a 2017 study utilizing a web-based sur- vey of 199 midwives (American College of Nurse-Midwives members) and 277 obstetricians (American Medical Association members) found that despite the known consequences of iodine deficiency for pregnant women and the recommendations of various medical organizations in the United States, overall, only 25% of the surveyed participants recommended or would recommend an adequate amount of iodine during preconception, pregnancy, and lactation. Of those respondents who reported prescribing iodine-containing supplements, 85% did so during the first trimester and 75% to 80% during the second and third trimesters; however, only 45% would prescribe the recommended mcg/day during pregnancy.232 Iodine-deficiency disorders include clinical hypothyroidism, which is associated with increased risk of poor perinatal outcomes, includ- ing preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, impaired neurocognitive development, and congenital hypothyroid- ism.34 Evidence is currently lacking, however, with respect to whether iodine supplementation during pregnancy and lactation is beneficial for the prevention of adverse pregnancy, neonatal, and childhood out- comes that result from iodine deficiency. Well-designed prospective, randomized, controlled trials that examine the neurodevelopmental effects of iodine supplementation in mildly to moderately iodine-de- ficient pregnant women are urgently needed.233 A 2017 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 14 studies meeting inclusion criteria, and 11 randomized and quasi-randomized con- trolled trials involving 2700 women contributed data for the compar- isons in the review. With respect to maternal primary outcomes, no clear differences between groups were found. An evaluation of neona- tal and infant primary outcomes found that compared with those who did not receive iodine supplementation, there was a 34% lower likeli- hood of perinatal mortality, although this difference was not statisti- cally significant; all perinatal deaths occurred in one trial conducted in severely iodine-deficient mothers. There were no clear differences between groups of other neonatal/infant primary outcomes in trials taking place in settings of mild to moderate iodine deficiency. The

authors concluded there were insufficient data to reach any meaning- ful conclusions on the benefits and harms of routine iodine supple- mentation in women before, during, or after pregnancy.234 The WHO estimates that over 1.8 billion people worldwide have insufficient iodine intake.229 Initiating iodized salt programs has been the most effective global strategy to mitigate iodine deficiency, with approximately 70% of households worldwide using iodized salt. However, iodine insufficiency is still prevalent in many regions, including Europe, where 52% of the population has insufficient iodine intake, and according to UNICEF, only about 49% of households in Europe (outside of the Western European subregion) have access to iodized salt. Iodine insufficiency is also prevalent in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the eastern Mediterranean WHO regions, where rates of iodized salt use range from approximately 47% to 67%.235 The RDA for iodine during pregnancy is 220 mcg, and the RDA is 290 mcg for lactation. Iodine is present in breast milk. As part of the standard American diet, dietary sources of iodine are primarily con- sumed as dairy products (e.g., milk), eggs, and seafood and seaweed (e.g., kelp, nori, kombu, and wakame) and as potassium iodide in the form of table salt. However, around the world, including the United States and the European Union, there is a high degree of variability in the iodine content of numerous foods that are considered import- ant dietary sources. Authoritative medical organizations, including the European Thyroid Association, American Thyroid Association, Endocrine Society, and American Academy of Pediatrics, have pub- lished recommendations stating that women need to supplement their diet with 150 mcg of iodine per day during preconception, pregnancy, and lactation. Fortunately, a large number of prenatal multivitamin– mineral supplements studied provide 150 mcg of potassium iodide per serving.236

## Iron

Iron is a critical mineral as an essential component of hemoglobin (an erythrocyte protein that carries oxygen to tissues throughout the body) and myoglobin and is important in myelination, neurotransmitter function, various cellular and oxidative processes, energy production, liver cytochrome P450 detoxification enzymes, and thyroid hormone production.237 The WHO considers iron deficiency to be the main cause of anemia during pregnancy, and it is a significant worldwide public health issue, especially in low-income developing countries. The overall prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnant women in the United States is near 18%, and rates of IDA are increasing across trimesters from 6.9% to 14.3% to 28.4%.238 In a review considering data from European countries that included national surveys and clinical trials, the evidence suggested that the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) and IDA in gestational weeks 32 to 39 was 28% to 85% and 21% to 35%, respectively. Women who were taking iron supplements had higher iron status and a lower prevalence of ID and IDA, which were cor- related to the iron dosage taken.239 The increased risk of developing IDA during pregnancy is due to heightened maternal iron needs and demands from the growing fetus and placenta; increased erythrocyte mass; and expansion of maternal blood volume, especially as the pregnancy progresses into the third trimester.240 Reduced levels of hemoglobin limit the availability of oxygen to the fetus, and anemia during pregnancy poses risks to both mother and fetus, including altered fetoplacental ratio, IUGR, low birth weight, premature birth, and higher risk of peripartum blood transfusion.241 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating 18 trials (932,090 participants) found that IDA in the first trimester increases the risk of premature birth. This relationship was not significant in the second and third trimesters.242 Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also demonstrated that maternal IDA can be con- sidered a significant risk factor for low birth weight.243,244 A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 44 trials (43,274 participants) comparing the effects of daily supplements con- taining iron versus no iron or placebo during pregnancy. Preventive iron supplementation lessened maternal anemia at term by 70%, as well as IDA and iron deficiency by 57% at term, respectively, com- pared with the no-iron or placebo groups. Median hemoglobin con- centrations were higher in pregnant women at term and postpartum receiving iron supplementation. There were no significant differences between groups for severe anemia in the second and third trimesters or maternal mortality. Iron supplementation was associated with reduced frequency of low birth weight and preterm deliveries, although these findings did not reach statistical significance. No clear differences were demonstrated between groups for neonatal death or congenital abnormalities.245 Given that all pregnant women are at higher risk for IDA, routine screening in preconception and throughout pregnancy is recom- mended. The RDA for iron during pregnancy is 27 mg per day and to 10 mg per day for lactation. There are various dietary supplemen- tal forms of iron chelate; the most commonly found over-the-counter option is ferrous sulfate. However, a recent randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 187 women with second-trimester IDA found that after the 8-week study duration, ferrous bis-glycinate (Ferrochel) was more effective in increasing hemoglobin levels, had significantly fewer side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal upset and constipation), and had greater compliance compared with ferrous sulfate.246 The vast majority of professionally manufactured prenatal multivitamin–min- eral formulas include an iron chelate in dosages, allowing for the RDA to be met. Dietary iron occurs in two forms, heme and nonheme. Heme iron has higher bioavailability than nonheme iron. Animal sources such as red meat, poultry, and seafood yield heme iron, whereas plant- based foods like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods such as cereals contain the nonheme form.


Magnesium is an essential and widely abundant mineral in the body and serves as a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regu- late a plethora of biochemical reactions, including synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation, maintaining normal nerve conduction, muscle contraction and car- diac rhythm, structural integrity of bone, energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis.247 A prospective trial assessing serum magnesium levels during low- risk pregnancies (145 participants) demonstrated that both ionized and total serum magnesium were significantly reduced after the 18th week of gestation compared with measurements before this time.248 Changes in magnesium homeostasis and deficiency status have been suggested as playing a role in several pregnancy-related conditions and outcomes, including hypertension, preeclampsia, IUGR, PTB, and neonatal hospitalization. One such study showed a correlation between low plasma levels of magnesium in pregnant women and pre- eclampsia and PTB.249 Primigravida women were administered 300 mg magnesium citrate (29 participants) or placebo (30 participants) from the 25th week of gestation until delivery in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Blood pressure was monitored every 2 to 3 weeks throughout pregnancy, in addition to pregnancy outcomes.250 In the treatment group, both the average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at week 37 and the number of participants with an increase in DBP of ≥ 15 mm Hg were significantly lower. Specifically, the proportion of women with

an increase of ≥ 15 mm Hg was 25% higher in the placebo group as compared with the magnesium intervention group (8%). There were no differences between treatment and placebo groups with respect to gestational length, duration of labor, or birth weight. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial examined the effects of magnesium supplementation on metabolic status and pregnancy outcomes in 70 participants with magnesium deficiency and GDM. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 250 mg magnesium oxide daily or a placebo for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were drawn at baseline and after intervention comple- tion. Compared with placebo, magnesium supplementation was found to have a significant benefit for a variety of metabolic parameters, including fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin concentration, quan- titative insulin sensitivity check index, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and plasma malondialdehyde concentrations.251 Magnesium supplementation was also associated with lower incidence of newborn hyperbilirubinemia and hospitalization. Another trial sought to assess the potential impact of magnesium supplementation on a range of primary outcomes in 180 pregnant women. Serum magnesium levels of women with a pregnancy of ges- tational age 12 to 14 weeks were measured. Inclusion criteria were single pregnancy and no history of acute renal disease, chronic hyper- tension, severe anemia, diabetes, pancreatic disease, heart disease, and cigarette or alcohol use. Participants were randomized into treat- ment or control groups. Those with a serum magnesium level >1.9 mg/dL were considered the control, Group A (60 participants), and received one multimineral tablet daily until the end of pregnancy. Those with serum magnesium levels <1.9 mg/dL (defined as hypo- magnesemia) were randomly assigned to Group B and Group C, with 60 participants in each group. Group B participants were adminis- tered one multimineral tablet daily until the end of pregnancy, and Group C received one multivitamin tablet daily in addition to a 200- mg effervescent magnesium tablet daily until the end of pregnancy. The multivitamin–mineral tablet contained 100 mg of magnesium. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups and included IUGR, preterm labor, maternal BMI, neonatal weight, pregnancy-in- duced hypertension, preeclampsia, GDM, lower leg muscle cramping, and Apgar scores.252 The study found that Group C had significant reductions in each of the identified pregnancy outcomes and in the frequency of pregnancy complications when compared with Group A and Group B. The daily RDA for magnesium in pregnancy ranges from 350 mg to 400 mg and from 310 mg to 360 mg during lactation, depending on maternal age. Prenatal multivitamin–mineral supplements vary widely in the amount of magnesium provided and typically do not meet 100% of the RDA level; it is therefore suggested that women consume magnesium-rich dietary sources as well, including whole grains, dark- green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are considered essen- tial because they must be obtained from the diet, and their nutritional value is critical during fetal growth and development, as well as in early infancy and childhood. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicos- apentaenoic acid (EPA). Rich dietary sources of ALA are found pri- marily in plant-based oils, such as flaxseed, chia seed, walnut, canola, and soybean, whereas DHA- and EPA-rich foods include fish, krill, shrimp, and other seafood, especially cold-water fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and anchovies. Foods fortified with DHA can also be readily found and include eggs, dairy products, nondairy beverages, and infant formulas.253 Omega-3 fatty acids are particularly critical for fetal brain, nervous system, and retina development. Maternal plasma DHA levels are observed to be significantly increased during early pregnancy, before neural tube closure, suggesting DHA’s contribution to embryo devel- opment. DHA also rapidly accumulates in the fetal brain in the third trimester, which continues throughout the first 2 years of infancy.254 Retinal development requires a high concentration of DHA, which optimizes the fluidity of photoreceptor membranes, retinal integrity, and visual function.255 The NAM has established AIs for omega-3 fatty acids. During preg- nancy and lactation, the AI for omega-3s as ALA is 1.4 g and 1.3 g per day, respectively; the NAM recommends that DHA and EPA contrib- ute 10% of the total omega-3 fatty acid intake. Note that the reason for the NAM using ALA as the required intake is due to the fact that DHA and EPA are not considered essential fatty acids because they can be derived from the desaturation and elongation of their parent fatty acid, ALA. Thus, unlike for ALA, RDAs and DRIs have not been established for DHA and EPA. However, a variety of worldwide groups have made recommendations and issued policy statements on the matter254: • Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: 200 mg DHA and 100 mg EPA • World Association of Perinatal Medicine: 200 mg DHA per day • European Food Safety Authority: an additional 100 to 200 mg DHA per day beyond 250 mg EPA + DHA per day • American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: 340 g (two 6-oz servings) seafood per week, providing approximately 200 mg DHA per day • Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA): 8-oz serving per week of a variety of seafood (approximately 250 mg EPA + DHA) • FDA in concert with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): 2 to 3 servings (approximately 8–12 ounces) of fish from the “Best Choices” list they issued Despite these guidelines, in the United States, a 2018 analysis of data from the 2001–2014 NHANES estimated that the majority of childbearing-age and pregnant women consume significantly lower amounts of seafood than what is recommended. The mean usual intake of seafood was 0.44 ± 0.02 oz equivalent per day, placing 100% of the population studied below the DGA recommendation. This sub- sequently leads to lower-than-optimal dietary intakes of DHA and EPA. In addition, it was found that dietary supplement use has not eliminated this dietary shortfall of omega-3 fatty acids.254 A systematic review and meta-analysis included nine randomized controlled trials, involving 5980 women, and sought to examine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on preterm delivery. Six trials evaluated early preterm delivery (<34 weeks’ gestation), and three trials evaluated any preterm delivery (<37 weeks’ gestation). Interventions were DHA, EPA, or a combination of DHA and EPA, with daily dosages ranging from 133 mg to 3000 mg. Treatment began before 24 weeks’ gestation in seven out of nine trials. The study found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduced the risk of early preterm delivery by 58% and the risk of any preterm delivery by 17%. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation also increased mean gestational age by 1.95 weeks and mean birth weight by 122.1 g, and it decreased perinatal death by 49%.256 For decades, epidemiological and observational studies have asso- ciated maternal seafood consumption and omega-3 fatty acid intake during pregnancy and lactation with better infant health outcomes, including improved childhood cognitive and visual development. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 38 randomized controlled trials, with 53 intervention arms, of omega-3 PUFA sup- plementation in mothers (13 studies) and infants (preterm infants, studies; term infants, 18 studies). The study evaluated standardized

measures of cognitive and visual development up to 18 years of age. Significant differences were not identified by world region, race, maternal education, age at outcome assessment, supplementa- tion duration, DHA or EPA dose, DHA:arachidonic acid ratio, or study quality score. Compared with placebo, omega-3 supplemen- tation was found to improve childhood psychomotor and visual development.257 Epidemiological and clinical research findings regarding seafood consumption during pregnancy can often appear contradictory, and this is in part due to the fact that most fish contain competing ben- efits and risks in the form of omega-3 fatty acids and toxicant levels, particularly methylmercury (MeHg).258 During pregnancy, MeHg readily transports across the placental barrier and subsequently accu- mulates in both placental and fetal tissues, thereby directly affecting the developing fetus.259 Furthermore, data from 34 studies demon- strated that MeHg levels in breast milk were generally higher in pop- ulations with high fish consumption.260 The long half-life of mercury in fish (approximately 2 years) leads to substantial bioaccumulation in larger ocean fish. Given that the half-life of MeHg in humans is days, weekly intake of fish yielding just 0.1 PPM of mercury exposure can result in elevated blood mercury levels.146 Given the inherent concerns and risks associated with seafood con- sumption and in utero toxicant exposure, it is especially well advised that women obtain the majority of their essential DHA and EPA intake via dietary supplementation in the form of either algae-derived oil (i.e., vegetarian source) or fish oil during preconception, pregnancy, and lactation. Methylmercury and other toxins such as dioxins and PCBs found in fish can be effectively removed from omega-3 fatty acid supplements during the molecular distillation and manufactur- ing process. Such dietary supplementation has been shown to confer a variety of maternal, fetal, and infant health benefits. And ideally, pregnant and lactating women should consume only those fish that are low in mercury levels yet high in omega-3 fatty acids. Plant-based oils contain ALA and should thus be emphasized as part of an overall healthy, pregnancy-supporting diet. However, the endogenous con- version (primarily in the liver) of ALA (the parent omega-3 PUFA) to the more biologically active long-chain omega-3 PUFAs (DHA and EPA) is inefficient in humans and produces only very small amounts of the latter. Therefore, the consumption of preformed omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) is the only practical way to increase appropriate levels in the body and should be emphasized for optimal health. This is of particular importance for vegetarian and vegan women.


Vitamin A is a fat-soluble substance derived from both preformed retinoids and provitamin carotenoids (in those who can make the conversion). Vitamin A has three active forms (retinal, retinol, and ret- inoic acid) and a storage form (retinyl ester). Preformed vitamin A is obtained from animal sources such as liver, kidney, fish, eggs, and dairy products, whereas provitamin A is found in plants, specifically in the form of the pigments beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptox- anthin. Both provitamin A and preformed vitamin A must be metab- olized intracellularly into the active forms of vitamin A, retinoic acid and retinol, to support the vitamin’s critical biological functions.261 In pregnancy, additional vitamin A is required at various distinct stages of embryonic and fetal growth and development, including gene expres- sion and cell differentiation. Target tissues are rather ubiquitous and include the ocular, circulatory, respiratory, urogenital, immune, and central nervous systems. Vitamin A deficiency remains a prevalent concern in developing low- and middle-income countries. According to the WHO, vita- min A deficiency affects 19 million pregnant women worldwide, and supplementation can reduce infant mortality in regions where this micronutrient deficiency is common, with Africa and Southeast Asian countries affected the most.1 Excess vitamin A has potential teratogenic effects and is contra- indicated during pregnancy. A single dose of a vitamin A supple- ment ≥ 25,000 IU is not recommended because its safety is uncertain. Moreover, this dose may be teratogenic if consumed between days and 60 from conception.1 Periconception exposures greater than 25,000 IU of preformed vitamin A (retinol and retinyl esters) have not been sufficiently studied to establish specific risk.262 Preformed vitamin A is correlated with teratogenicity, whereas the provitamin A carotenoid form naturally occurring in food sources and contained in the majority of prenatal multivitamin–mineral supplements is not teratogenic.263 A Cochrane systematic review sought to determine the effect of vitamin A supplementation (with or without other supplements) during pregnancy on maternal and newborn clinical outcomes. The study included 19 trials including over 310,000 women, with all trials conducted in lower- and middle-income countries, with the exception of 1 trial in the United Kingdom. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that vitamin A supplementation in deficient populations during preg- nancy likely reduces maternal anemia and gestational night blindness but has no effect on maternal mortality. With respect to fetal and neo- natal outcomes, high-certainty and moderate-certainty evidence sug- gest that vitamin A supplementation in the same population makes little or no difference to perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, still- births, low birth weight, and PTB.264 Another comprehensive system- atic review and meta-analysis made similar conclusions, stating that there is little consistent evidence of a benefit of maternal supplementa- tion with vitamin A (or beta-carotene) during pregnancy on maternal mortality and no significant overall effect on birth-weight indicators, PTB, miscarriage, stillbirth, or fetal loss.265 In populations where habitual sufficient daily vitamin A intakes exceed 8000 IU (2400 mcg/day), there is no demonstrated benefit from taking vitamin A supplements during pregnancy. And the potential risk of adverse events increases with intakes ≥ 10,000 IU per day if vita- min A supplements are routinely taken in these populations.1 Dosages of vitamin A in excess of 10,000 IU per day are associ- ated with teratogenic effects, including cranial-facial and cardiac birth defects. Therefore, the maximum recommended supplemental dose during pregnancy and lactation is 2400 mcg per day (8000 IU) as ret- inol. The RDA for vitamin A as retinol equivalents during pregnancy is 750 to 770 mcg (2500 IU) per day, and during lactation, it is to 1300 mcg (4200 IU).261 Vitamin A is found as preformed retinol in animal sources, with the highest levels found in beef liver, cod liver oil, dairy products, and fish. And as provitamin A, carotenoids are found in rich supply in leafy green vegetables and red, orange, and yellow vegetables and fruits.

## Vitamin C and Vitamin E (Antioxidants)

Oxidative stress has been implicated in various pathophysiological pro- cesses during pregnancy. For example, oxidative stress due to increased production of free radicals and lipid peroxidation combined with insufficient antioxidant defenses is a known etiological component of endothelial dysfunction and placental insufficiency and thus may be causally associated with preeclampsia and SGA infants.266 However, available clinical evidence does not support a preventive or therapeutic use of antioxidant supplementation with vitamin C and/or vitamin E for the prevention of preeclampsia and fetal/neonatal outcomes such as preterm birth, SGA infants, congenital anomalies, and infections.267 A systematic review of 29 randomized controlled trials involving 24,300 women from 17 different countries found no significant dif- ferences in improved outcomes between women supplemented with

## 1737CHAPTER 211 Preconception and Pregnancy Health

vitamin C alone or in combination with other supplements (mainly vitamin E) compared with the placebo or control groups for risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal death, SGA infants, PTB, or preeclampsia.268 Another systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials found no clear difference between women supplemented with vitamin E alone or in combination with other supplements (including vitamin C) during pregnancy versus placebo. There were no demonstrated improved clinical outcomes for prevention of stillbirth, neonatal death, preeclampsia, PTB, IUGR, or premature rupture of membranes.269 The most commonly used dose in the clinical trials analyzed in the previously referenced Cochrane reviews was vitamin C 1000 mg daily (13 trials) and vitamin E 400 IU daily (15 trials). The majority of the trials began administering supplementation in the second trimester.


Vitamin D is obtained either from ultraviolet B–induced synthesis in the skin or from dietary intake. Whether derived from sun expo- sure or food, vitamin D is initially relatively biologically inert and must undergo two sequential hydroxylation steps in the body for it to become active.270 The first step occurs in the liver, where previtamin D is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the main circulating form—which is either bound to vitamin D–binding protein (85%–90%) or albumin (10%–15%) or is in a free form (<1% unbound)—and acts as a reservoir for conversion to the active metabolite.271 This second step occurs primarily in the kidneys, where 25(OH)D is converted into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], the physiologically bioactive vitamin D steroid hormone or calcitriol.272 This conversion also occurs to a lesser extent within the bone and parathyroid glands. Furthermore, during pregnancy, the placenta is also actively converting 25(OH)D to calcitriol on a local-tissue level without significantly contributing to circulating serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations.271 The primary role of vitamin D is in calcium and phosphate homeo- stasis. It is also required for normal bone mineralization, neuromus- cular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation, and it modulates genetic encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.270 Thus, during pregnancy, vitamin D metabolism is under increased demand to support the growth and development of the fetus. Compared with nonpregnant baseline, by 12 weeks’ gestation, there is a twofold increase in 1,25(OH)2D serum concentration, and this continues to rise two- to threefold during the course of gestation.273 Total serum 25(OH)D concentration is considered the most rep- resentative indicator of vitamin D status because it reflects both cuta- neous vitamin D synthesis and that obtained from food and dietary supplements. However, there is a lack of universal consensus on defining what constitutes optimal 25(OH)D concentrations during pregnancy and lactation.274 The NAM has recommended a 25(OH)D concentration threshold of >50 nmol/L (>20 ng/mL) to define suffi- ciency because this level is associated with the prevention of bone man- ifestations of vitamin D deficiency (rickets and osteomalacia) in 97.5% of Americans and Canadians.275 However, the Endocrine Society and Osteoporosis Canada suggest that a higher 25(OH)D serum concentra- tion of >75 nmol/L (>30 ng/mL) is needed for optimal health and bone development. Although no verifiable, agreed-upon serum 25(OH)D concentration has been established for pregnancy, screening for vita- min D sufficiency is advisable during preconception and early preg- nancy because it is potentially clinically useful.276 What is conclusive, however, is that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in pregnant women and newborns worldwide. Research suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia, GDM, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, SGA infants, and PTB.272,277 Thus a growing body of evidence suggests that vitamin D supplemen- tation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of these adverse gesta- tional outcomes. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently find that preg- nant women supplementing with vitamin D have significantly higher 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy and at term compared with placebo or control grous.277–279 Clinical trials also support safely and effectively treating vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women via oral supplemen- tation with 4000 IU vitamin D 3 per day from 12 to 16 weeks’ gestation to delivery.280 The RDA for vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation is 600 IU (15 mcg) per day. However, evidence suggests that this current RDA may not be sufficient for otherwise well-nourished women during pregnancy. A secondary analysis of data from a maternal and infant prospective cohort, the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study, evaluated total vitamin D intake (diet and supple- ments) and blood samples of 537 women during their second trimes- ter. Participants were 87% Caucasian, with a mean age of 31.3 years and an average BMI 25.8; 58% were primiparous, 90% completed post–high school education, and 80% had annual family income greater than $70,000. Although a significant relationship was demon- strated between reported maternal vitamin D intake and increased 25(OH)D concentration, the study found that 46% of participants did not meet the Health Canada RDA of 600 IU per day and that 20% did not achieve the recommended sufficiency level of 75 nmol/L serum 25(OH)D concentration. Moreover, approximately 50% of partici- pants assessed as being vitamin D insufficient were found to be con- suming the recommended RDA.275 High serum 25(OH)D concentrations in early pregnancy (on average, 15 ± 1 weeks’ gestation) have been shown to be significantly inversely correlated with and protective against the development of GDM. Women in the lowest quartile for 25(OH)D concentration had a twofold-higher risk of GDM compared with women in the highest quartile.276,281,282 Pregnant women supplementing with vitamin D and thus sufficient 25(OH)D status are found to have lower risk of preeclampsia.277,278,283 A small, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial found that supplementing with vitamin D reduced the risk of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA). Eighty women (aged 18–35 years) with history of experiencing at least two consecutive or three nonconsecutive spontaneous abortions of unknown cause and pregnancy by the same partner in all past and present pregnancies were randomized to either an intervention group (40 participants) and administered 400 IU vitamin D 3 per day or a placebo group (40 participants). Both groups were prescribed 400 mg vaginal proges- terone daily, and all participants were administered folic acid and iron supplementation at least 1 month before pregnancy. Primary outcomes included serum 25(OH)D measured at baseline and com- pletion of the study; interleukin 23 (IL-23) measured at baseline and completion of the study, as well as at time of spontaneous abortion; and pregnancy loss, considered as URSA from study onset to weeks’ gestation. The number of spontaneous abortions during the study period was 5 in the intervention group and 13 in the control group. The study concluded that compared with placebo, vitamin D 3 supplementation leads to (1) increased serum 25(OH)D levels, (2) decreased serum interleukin (IL)-23 levels, and (3) significantly fewer incidence of spontaneous abortion through the causal pathway with IL-23 among women with URSA.284 Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated an association between vitamin D status and pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Compared with women replete in vitamin D at preconception, those with insufficient

or deficient vitamin D status have a significantly decreased probability of achieving clinical pregnancy and live birth after in vitro fertilization (IVF) and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).285–287 And in a retrospective cohort study, vitamin D deficiency was associated with a 50% reduction in both clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in recipi- ents of donor eggs compared with participants who had sufficient vita- min D status.288 Vitamin D supplementation is frequently required during preg- nancy and lactation to achieve sufficient vitamin D status as suggested by nutritional guidelines.271 A majority of prenatal multivitamin–min- eral supplements allow women to achieve the RDA for pregnancy and lactation in addition to dietary sources. Vitamin D is fat soluble and available in fortified foods and dietary supplements in two forms, D 2 (ergocalciferol) and D 3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D 2 is derived by ultraviolet irradiation of ergosterol in yeast, whereas D 3 is manufac- tured from the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol from lanolin and the chemical conversion of cholesterol.270 Naturally occur- ring vitamin D 3 is found in a limited number of foods, and these are primarily animal-based sources, including the flesh of fatty fish (e.g., swordfish, tuna, salmon, and mackerel) and fish liver oil, beef liver, dairy products, and egg yolk. The synthetic vitamin D 2 is structurally different from the natural D 3 and has somewhat—and controversial— different physiological and toxicological effects. (See Chapter 203, Osteoporosis, for a comprehensive discussion.)


Zinc is one of the most abundant essential trace minerals in the body and is required for the catalytic activity of over 100 enzymes. Zinc is thus involved in a wide array of biological processes, including carbo- hydrate and protein metabolism, DNA synthesis, cell division, innate and adaptive immune responses, inflammatory processes, and hor- mone regulation. The significance of zinc to the growth of the fetus is demonstrated by the active transport of the mineral across the placenta into the fetal circulation, resulting in higher cord blood concentrations compared with those in maternal circulation.289 Pregnant women are predisposed and vulnerable to low zinc status and deficiency states due to (1) a significantly increased demand asso- ciated with accelerated growth and fetal development, (2) the body’s lack of a specialized zinc-storage system,290 and (3) the dependence of dietary intake and bioavailability on the composition of the diet. Globally, zinc deficiency is a rather common clinical finding, and research has shown an association between low maternal circulating zinc concentrations and pregnancy complications. A systematic review of 64 observational studies assessing mater- nal circulating zinc concentrations and pregnancy complications found a significant difference in pregnant women with poor zinc sta- tus and low-birth-weight infants, as well as an association between low-zinc status and hypertension, particularly in women with severe preeclampsia.289 A Cochrane review evaluated 21 randomized controlled trials involving 17,000 participants with respect to zinc supplementation compared with no intervention or placebo and pregnancy outcomes. Low-certainty evidence found that zinc supplementation resulted in a small, relevant reduction (14%) in PTB (7637 participants, 16 trials, primarily representing women of low income) and induction of labor (1 trial). No significant differences were found between the zinc-treat- ment groups versus the no-zinc or placebo groups for any other pri- mary maternal or neonatal outcomes.291 Many of the studies were at risk for bias, thus influencing the certainty of the review evidence on the impact of zinc supplementation. Six of the included trials were conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, and Denmark; all others were conducted in low- to middle-income countries. There was wide variation among trials with respect to the following: size (range: 56–4926 participants), zinc dosage (range: 5–90 mg/day), nutritional and zinc status at trial entry, initiation and duration of supplementa- tion (starting before conception in 1 trial, first or second trimester in the majority of trials, or after 26 weeks’ gestation in 2 trial, until deliv- ery) and compliance with treatment.1 Rich dietary sources of zinc include oysters, shellfish, red meat, chicken, beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy products, and whole grains. However, the bioavailability of zinc can be compromised in vegan and vegetarian diets due to higher amounts of phytate and fiber—found in plants, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and cereals— which bind to zinc and inhibit its absorption. And although plant- based foods are still reasonable dietary sources, plant-derived zinc is inherently less bioavailable compared with animal food sources.292 A systematic review analyzed six observational studies, and a meta-anal- ysis was conducted to compare the zinc intake/status of vegetarians compared with nonvegetarians during pregnancy. The zinc intake of pregnant vegetarians was found to be lower than that of nonvegetar- ian pregnant control populations. Neither of the groups met the RDA for zinc, and no differences were found between groups in serum/ plasma zinc.293 The RDA for zinc during pregnancy is 11 mg/day, and it is 12 mg/ day when breastfeeding. Prenatal multivitamin–mineral supplements commonly yield the RDA for zinc. Dietary modifications intended to optimize zinc intake, bioavailability, and status are an important con- sideration during preconception, pregnancy, and lactation, especially for vegan and vegetarian women. Due to the physiological adaptations associated with gestation and fetal and newborn growth and develop- ment, as well as the inherent demands in zinc metabolism, sufficient daily intake should be ensured to meet the increased requirements.

# CONCLUSION

Pregnancy offers an unparalleled opportunity to improve maternal health and overall well-being; reduce the risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and childhood outcomes; and address modifiable factors toward encouraging a healthy pregnancy. Implementation of natural medi- cine approaches serves to support positive pregnancy experiences and birth outcomes by utilizing the preconception and gestational periods to educate and empower parents regarding best practices in order to create optimal conditions for the future health of the next generation.

## 1740SECTION 6 Diseases

to the changes in ovarian-steroid–induced neurotransmitters. Of the neurotransmitters studied, serotonin is the principal one impli- cated in the pathogenesis of PMS and PMDD.10,11 Whether PMS and PMDD are related to absolute levels or reduced blood levels of serotonin or to serotonin transport remains unclear.12 Other neurotransmitter systems may also be involved in PMS and PMDD. They include the adrenergic, opioid, and gamma-ami- nobutyric acid (GABA) systems. Recent studies have implicated allo- pregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone and a potent positive modulator of the GABA A receptor, as having an important role. For example, an important randomized controlled trial of the α -reduc- tase inhibitor dutasteride, which blocks the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone, found a significant reduction in core symptoms among women with PMDD, including irritability, sadness, anxiety, food cravings, and bloating, with 75% of women enrolled in the study no longer meeting the criteria for PMDD after 1 month of active treat- ment.13 Research over the last 10 to 15 years has shown that SSRIs can alleviate both the psychological and physical symptoms in most women with PMDD. Fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and venlafaxine have all been found to be significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of PMDD. Interestingly, SSRIs also enhance the conversion of progesterone to allopregnano- lone, increasing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of this neurosteroid, which suggests that fluctuations in allopregnanolone may be more consequential than absolute levels.

# DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION

The diagnosis of PMS is usually made through the association of the symptoms attributed to PMS with their occurrence during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. To aid in the diagnosis, symptom ques- tionnaires are often used. Recalled information is less accurate; there- fore, in addition to a symptom questionnaire, the patient may be asked to keep a menstrual symptom diary. This helps to document improve- ment as well as to further clarify the symptom pattern. The key defining feature of both PMS and PMDD is the timing of symptoms, which appear only during the luteal phase and disappear before or during menstruation. Fundamental to making the diagnosis is to rule out other psychiatric and medical disorders. The clinician should obtain a medical and psychiatric history and be aware that many mental and physical disorders mimic premenstrual symptoms and may also coexist with them. The results of the medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial evaluations along with the symptom diary offered by the patient can help the clinician to determine whether the symptoms represent PMS or PMDD, a psychiatric or medical illness only, coexist- ing PMS or PMDD and another illness, or premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying psychiatric or medical illness. Only one of the following symptoms is required for a diagnosis of PMS: mild psychological discomfort, bloating and weight gain, breast tenderness, swelling of hands and feet, various aches and pains, poor concentration, sleep disturbance, and change in appetite. The symptoms must (1) occur only in the luteal phase, (2) peak close to menstruation, and (3) subside at the onset of menses or during menstrual flow. A diag- nosis of PMDD is reserved for women who have at least 5 of 11 specific symptoms at a severe level such that they interfere significantly with daily life and relationships and occur in the premenstrual phase of the cycle.14 It must include one (or more) of the following symptoms: • Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings, feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection) • Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts • Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecat- ing thoughts • Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge • It must also include one (or more) of the following symptoms, for a total of five (or more) • Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies) • Subjective difficulty concentrating • Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy • Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings • Hypersomnia or insomnia • Feeling overwhelmed or out of control • Additional physical symptoms (breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain)


Even though it is now understood that there is no frank increase or decrease in serum estrogen or progesterone levels, a possible relative excess or insufficiency in terms of its effect on the central nervous sys- tem should still be considered. Owing to the lack of scientific under- standing in this area and the clinical experience in improving estrogen metabolism in women with PMS, some clinical considerations from the past should still be recalled.

## Estrogen Metabolism

In the early 1940s, Morton Biskind observed an apparent relation- ship between B-vitamin deficiency and PMS.15,16 He postulated that PMS, as well as excessive menstruation and fibrocystic breast disease, was due to an excess in estrogen levels caused by decreased detoxifi- cation and elimination in the liver as a result of B-vitamin deficiency. The liver uses various B vitamins to detoxify estrogen and excrete it in the bile. There appears to be support for Biskind’s theory. Estrogen excess is known to produce cholestasis, a term that signifies dimin- ished bile flow or stasis of bile. Naturopathic physicians often refer to this condition as a “sluggish liver.” It reflects minimal impair- ment of liver function because normal indicators of liver status (such as concentrations of the liver enzymes alkaline phosphatase,

## 1741CHAPTER 212 Premenstrual Syndrome

serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamate pyru- vate transaminase, and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase) are not elevated. These enzyme measurements, the conventional means of assessing liver status, are not very useful because they serve only to indicate liver damage, being elevated only when the liver is com- promised. They have little correlation with liver function. Because of the liver’s important role in numerous metabolic processes, even a minor impairment of liver function can have profound effects. Cholestasis can be caused by a large number of factors besides estrogen excess (Box 212.2). The presence of cholestasis may be a predisposing factor in PMS because with cholestasis, there is reduced estrogen detoxification and clearance. Hence, a positive-feedback sce- nario is produced. The high incidence of gallstones is a clear indication that many American women suffer from cholestasis. Again, even though elevated serum estrogen values cannot be con- firmed in PMS studies, it is interesting to note that estrogen excess during the luteal phase affects endorphin levels negatively. One study found a direct correlation between an increased estrogen:pro- gesterone ratio and endorphin activity in the brain.17 In essence, when the estrogen:progesterone ratio was increased, there was a decline in endorphin levels. This reduction is significant consider- ing the known ability of endorphins to normalize or improve mood. Other studies have shown that low endorphin levels during the luteal phase are common in women with PMS.18 Endorphins are lowered by stress and raised by exercise. The role of endorphins is discussed further later in the chapter. Finally, recent data suggest that estro- gen-receptor sensitivity may play a role. In a study that enrolled women with PMDD and 96 controls, estrogen levels were not found to be correlated with PMDD. However, among women who carried the G allele of the estrogen receptor (ESR) α -Xbal polymorphism (rs9340799), premenstrual estrogen level was negatively correlated with anxiety and stress; this polymorphism also appeared to affect emotion regulation.19 Thus the impact of estrogen on premenstrual symptoms may also be influenced by genetic polymorphism in the estrogen receptor.

## Estrogen Impairs Vitamin B

## 6

The way in which estrogen levels during the luteal phase negatively affect neurotransmitter and endorphin levels may be secondary to impairment of the action of vitamin B 6 . It is well known that estro- gens affect vitamin B 6 function negatively, and this includes more recent lower-dose estrogens.20 Vitamin B 6 levels are typically quite low in depressed patients, especially women taking estrogens (birth control pills or conjugated estrogens [Premarin]).21,22 Vitamin B 6 supplementation has been shown to have positive effects on all PMS symptoms, particularly depression, in many women (discussed in greater detail later). This improvement is achieved via a combination of a reduction in midluteal estrogen levels and an increase in midlu- teal progesterone levels.

## Dietary Considerations

Women suffering from PMS typically eat a diet that is even worse than the standard American diet. Abraham23 reports that, compared with symptom-free women, patients with PMS consume the following substances: • 62% more refined carbohydrates • 275% more refined sugar • 79% more dairy products • 78% more sodium • 53% less iron • 77% less manganese • 52% less zinc A diet that is higher in dairy products may also contribute to some PMS symptoms. A survey of 39 women with PMS and 14 women with- out reported that the women with PMS consumed fivefold more dairy products and threefold more refined sugar than the women without PMS.24 However, a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D was clearly shown to be associated with a lower risk for PMS in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort.25 Another study observed that women with PMS also have an increased intake of dietary fat, carbohydrates, and simple sugars and decreased protein intake.26 This is somewhat consistent with the results from a recent study of over 300 nurses, which found that a Western diet (characterized by a higher intake of red meat, fast foods, vegetable oil and mayonnaise, sweets and desserts, salty snacks, refined grains, sugar and soft drinks, high-fat dairy products, spices, and fried potato) was linked to a higher likelihood of PMS; women in the second and third quintiles of the Western pattern had an adjusted risk of 2.53 and 4.39, respectively, although a dose–response relationship was not observed.27 Food cravings are often also higher in women with PMS; this may, in part, be due to a decrease in serotonin during the luteal phase in PMS sufferers. Therefore serotonergic treatments may be helpful in controlling such food cravings.28 Another nutritional factor in PMS is the effect of refined sugars on rapid increases in insulin, which then causes the retention of sodium and subsequent water retention, with swelling in the hands and feet, abdom- inal bloating, and breast engorgement. Sugar has several detrimental actions in PMS. Eating foods high in simple sugars increases insulin secretion and can be harmful to blood sugar control, especially if the patient is hypoglycemic or diabetic. Sugar, especially combined with caf- feine, also has a detrimental effect on PMS and mood (discussed later).29 A high intake of sugar also impairs estrogen metabolism. The evidence is based on the higher frequency of PMS symptoms in women consuming a high-sugar diet and the fact that a high sugar intake is also associated with higher estrogen levels.30 One study found that a low-fat, high-com- plex-carbohydrate diet alleviated premenstrual breast tenderness.31 C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, has been correlated with the severity of both the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS, as have other biomarkers of inflammation.32–34 A diet that stim- ulates inflammatory pathways includes sugar, poultry, eggs, cheese, milk, white flour, white rice, and partially hydrogenated oils. Foods that can reduce inflammation include fresh fruits (especially berries), green leafy vegetables, fish, nuts, seeds, turmeric, garlic, and onions. Vegetarian women have been shown to excrete two to three times more estrogen in their feces and to have 50% lower levels of free estro- gen in their blood than omnivores.35,36 These differences are thought to be due to the lower fat and higher fiber intake of vegetarian women. These dietary differences may also explain the lower incidence of breast cancer, endometriosis, and uterine cancer in vegetarian women. They may also play a role in PMS. For example, a lower intake of plant pro- tein (but not total protein) was recently correlated to symptoms of PMS among athletes.37

At the very least, the clinician should recommend a diet lower in saturated fat and cholesterol (achieved by reducing or eliminating the consumption of animal products) and higher in fiber-rich plant foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes). Decreasing the percentage of calories as fat, in particular saturated fat, has dramatic effects on the reduction of circulating estrogen.38,39 In one study, when 17 women switched from the standard American diet (composed of 40% of calories as fat and only 12 g as fiber daily) to a low-fat, high-fiber diet (consisting of 25% of calories as fat and 40 g as fiber daily), there was a 36% reduction in blood estrogen levels, with 16 out of the 17 women demonstrating significant reductions in only 8 to 10 weeks.40 It should be noted that not all nutrition research shows a clear- cut association with PMS. In the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation, a cross-sectional analysis was conducted of PMS symptoms in a multiethnic sample of 3302 midlife women.41 The researchers sought to determine whether the frequency of physical or emotional premen- strual symptoms was associated with dietary intake of phytoestrogens/ fiber/fat or calcium, consumption of alcohol or caffeine, cigarette exposure, lack of physical exercise, and race/ethnicity or socioeco- nomic status. In this study, most dietary factors were not related to PMS. Fat intake was negatively associated with craving and bloating. Fiber intake was positively associated with breast pain. Alcohol intake was negatively associated with anxiety, mood changes, and headaches. Cigarette smoke exposure, whether passive or active, was positively associated with cramps and back pain. Ethnic differences in the report- ing of symptoms and comorbidity associations were observed as well.

## Thyroid Function

Low thyroid function (hypothyroidism) has been shown to affect a large proportion of women with PMS.42,43 For example, in one study, 51 of 54 subjects with PMS demonstrated low thyroid status compared with 0 of 12 in the control group.42 In another study, 7 of 10 subjects in the PMS group had low thyroid status compared with 0 of 9 in the control group.43 Other studies have also shown hypothyroidism to be only slightly more common in women with PMS than in controls.44,45 Many women with PMS and confirmed hypothyroidism who are given thyroid hormone experience complete relief of symptoms.42 For more information, see Chapter 182.

## Stress, Coping Style, and Depression

Study of the interaction of stress/serotonin and PMS has shown that serotonin levels in women with PMS fall after ovulation. Those with- out PMS had much higher levels of serotonin during the last half of the menstrual cycle. In a holistic/natural medicine approach to PMS, the identification of stressors and stress management should not be over- looked.46 Many women with PMS tend to employ “negative” coping styles,47 examples of which are listed in Box 212.3. It is important to identify the manner in which the patient deals with stress and to coun- sel her on more positive ways of coping. There are some important relationships between PMS and depression. Depression is a common feature in many cases of PMS, and PMS symptoms are typically more severe in depressed women.1 The reason appears to be a decrease in the brain level of various neurotransmitters, with serotonin and GABA being the most signifi- cant.48,49 The most common class of prescription medications rec- ommended for moderate to severe PMS/PMDD is an SSRI. When they are used for chronic depression, SSRIs must be taken daily. When used for PMS/PMDD, they can be taken just on the days of the month when the symptoms are the most problematic. This would suggest that when used in this way, they are not really increasing neurotransmitter levels but work by altering the neurophysiology and electrical conduction in the brain. Several SSRIs have been used, including fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine. However, various psychotherapy methods have been equally if not more success- ful in improving the psychological aspects of PMS. In particular, biofeedback and short-term individual counseling (especially cog- nitive therapy) have documented clinical efficacy.50,51 One of the advantages of cognitive therapy over antidepressant drug therapy in the treatment of PMS is that learning techniques such as cogni- tive-behavioral coping skills can produce excellent results that are maintained over time.


Several studies have shown that women engaged in a regular exer- cise program do not suffer from PMS nearly as often as sedentary women.52–54 In one of the more thorough studies, mood and physical symptoms during the menstrual cycle were assessed in 97 women who exercised regularly and in a second group of 159 women who did not exercise.52 Mood scores and physical symptoms assessed throughout the menstrual cycle showed significant effects of exercise on negative mood states and physical symptoms. The regular exercisers obtained significantly lower scores for impaired concentration, negative mood, behavior change, and pain. In another study, 143 women were monitored for 5 days in each of the three phases of their cycles (midcycle, premenstrual, and men- strual).52 The women were 35 competitive athletes, two groups of exer- cisers (33 high-frequency exercisers and 36 low-frequency exercisers), and 39 sedentary women. The high-frequency exercisers experienced the greater positive mood scores and sedentary women the least. The high-frequency exercisers also reported the least depression and anx- iety. The differences were most apparent during the premenstrual and menstrual phases. These results are consistent with the belief that women who exercise frequently (but not competitive athletes) are protected from PMS symptoms. In particular, regular exercise protects against the deterioration of mood before and during men- struation. A large study published in 2018 also supports the value of regular exercise; among the 7000 women enrolled in this study, those who participated in regular exercise had a reduced frequency of many symptoms, including backaches, abdominal discomfort, depression, and constipation.55 These studies provide evidence that women with PMS should par- take of the benefits of exercise. Exercise may reduce PMS symptoms by elevating endorphin values, improving glucose tolerance, decreasing catecholamines, and modulating estrogen levels.56


Nutritional supplements have been widely used in the treatment of PMS by alternative practitioners and also by women taking things into their own hands. Despite the inconsistent evidence, the positive results do show that nutritional supplements can offer safe, affordable solu- tions for many problems.

## Vitamin B6

The first use of vitamin B 6 in the management of cyclic conditions in women was in the successful treatment of depression caused by birth control pills, as noted in several studies in the early 1970s. These results led researchers to try to determine the effectiveness of vitamin B 6 in relieving PMS symptoms. Since 1975 at least a dozen double-blind clinical trials have been performed. Some of these studies have shown no effect, but most of the studies have shown a significant effect on the whole range of PMS symptoms at dosage ranges from 50 to 500 mg/ day.57 For example, in one double-blind crossover trial, 84% of the subjects had a lower symptom score during the vitamin B 6 treatment period.58 In another double-blind crossover trial, 50 mg/day of vitamin B 6 was effective in decreasing premenstrual depression, fatigue, and irritability.59 Although PMS has multiple causes, vitamin B 6 supple- mentation alone appears to benefit most patients. It is important to note, however, that not all double-blind studies of vitamin B 6 have shown a positive effect.57,60 The negative results in some trials may have been caused by many factors, such as the inability of some women to convert vitamin B 6 to its active form owing to a defi- ciency in another nutrient (e.g., vitamin B 2 or magnesium) that was not supplemented. These results suggest that supplementing pyridoxine by itself may not produce adequate clinical results for all women suffering from this disorder, and that some women may have difficulty convert- ing vitamin B 6 into its active form, pyridoxal-5-phosphate. To overcome this conversion difficulty, it may be necessary to use a broader-spectrum nutritional supplement or pyridoxal-5-phosphate. For most indications, the therapeutic dosage of vitamin B 6 is 50 to mg/day. This dose level is generally regarded as safe, even for long-term use. With the use of doses greater than 50 mg, it may be important to divide it into 50-mg doses taken throughout the day. A single dose of mg of pyridoxine did not lead to significantly higher pyridoxal-5-phos- phate levels in the blood than a 50-mg dose, possibly indicating that a 50-mg oral dose of pyridoxine is about all the liver can handle at once.61 Vitamin B 6 is one of the few water-soluble vitamins associated with some toxicity when taken in large doses or in moderate dosages for long periods. One-time doses larger than 2000 mg/day can produce symptoms of nerve toxicity (tingling sensations in the feet, loss of mus- cle coordination, and degeneration of nerve tissue) in some individu- als. Long-term intake of doses larger than 500 mg a day can be toxic if taken for many months or years.62 There are also a few rare reports of toxicity occurring at long-term dosages as low as 150 mg/day.62–64 The toxicity is thought to occur when supplemental pyridoxine overwhelms the liver’s ability to add a phosphate group to produce the active form of vitamin B 6 (pyridoxal-5-phosphate). As a result, it is speculated that pyridoxine either is toxic to the nerve cells or actually acts as an anti- metabolite by binding to pyridoxal-5-phosphate receptors, thereby creating a relative deficiency of vitamin B 6 ; this competitive inhibition of the active form of vitamin B 6 was recently shown in cell culture.65 Another possibility is that minute amounts of contaminants or vita- min B 6 analogs may have been introduced during synthesis. Although not a problem at normal doses of vitamin B 6 , contaminants present in larger doses may block vitamin B 6 activation sites. Again, it appears to make sense to limit doses to 50 mg at a time. If more than 50 mg/day is desired, the doses should be spread out throughout the day. Vitamin B 6 has the ability to increase the synthesis of several neu- rotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine, nor- epinephrine, epinephrine, taurine, and histamine. There are also extensive interactions between vitamin B 6 and magnesium, which work together in many enzyme systems. In fact, another mechanism by which vitamin B 6 may improve the symptoms of PMS is by increasing the accumulation of magnesium within body cells.66 Without vitamin B 6 , magnesium does not get inside the cell.


Magnesium deficiency has been implicated as a causative factor in PMS.67 Red blood cell (RBC) magnesium levels in patients with PMS have been shown to be significantly lower than in normal subjects.23,68 Because magnesium plays such an integral part in normal cell func- tion, magnesium deficiency may account for the wide range of symp- toms attributed to PMS. Furthermore, magnesium deficiency and PMS have many common features, and magnesium supplementation has been shown to be an effective treatment of PMS. In one study involving 32 women with PMS, 360 mg of magnesium three times daily was given from midcycle to the onset of menstrual flow.69 Relief of premenstrual mood fluctuations and depression during magne- sium treatment was significant. Women with migraines during their menses also appear to have lower magnesium levels during menstrual attacks, compared with migraines that do not occur during menses or during any part of the cycle without a migraine. The incidence of magnesium deficiency was 45% during menstrual attacks and approx- imately 15% at all other times.70 One study designed to improve understanding of the association between magnesium and the menstrual cycle measured plasma, RBC, and mononuclear blood cell (MBC) magnesium concentrations in 26 women with confirmed PMS and in a control group of 19 women during the follicular, ovulatory, early luteal, and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.71 Although there were no significant differences in plasma magnesium levels between patients with PMS and control sub- jects and there was no menstrual cycle effect on plasma magnesium, women with PMS had significantly lower RBC magnesium concentra- tions than those in the control group, which was consistent throughout the menstrual cycle. The observation of low RBC magnesium concentrations in patients with PMS has now been confirmed by four independent studies. In general, it is thought that women with PMS have a “vulnerability to luteal phase mood state destabilization,”71 and that chronic and endur- ing intracellular magnesium depletion serves as a major predisposing factor for destabilization. In addition to emotional instability, magnesium deficiency in PMS is characterized by excessive nervous sensitivity with generalized aches and pains and a lower premenstrual pain threshold. One clinical trial of magnesium in PMS showed a reduction of nervousness in 89%, breast tenderness in 96%, and weight gain in 95% of subjects.23 In another double-blind study, high-dose magnesium supplementation (360 mg three times daily) was shown to dramatically relieve PMS- related mood changes.69 Although magnesium has been shown to be effective on its own, even better results may be achieved by combining it with vitamin B 6 and other nutrients. Several studies have shown that when patients with PMS are given a multivitamin/multimineral supplement con- taining high doses of magnesium and pyridoxine, they experience a substantial reduction in PMS symptoms.72,73 A clinical trial with two intervention groups (magnesium; magnesium combined with vitamin B6) and a placebo group suggests that the combination was more effective for the reduction of premenstrual symptoms than magnesium alone.74 The optimal intake of magnesium should be based on body weight, 6 mg/kg. For a 50-kg woman, the recommendation would be 300 mg; for a 90-kg woman, 540 mg. Because these doses are difficult to achieve by diet alone, supplementation is recommended. In the treatment of PMS, a dose of twice this amount, 12 mg/kg, may be needed. Magnesium bound to aspartate or one of the Krebs cycle intermedi- ates (malate, succinate, fumarate, or citrate) is preferred to magnesium oxide, gluconate, sulfate, or chloride because of better absorption and fewer side effects (laxative effects).75,76

## Calcium

Calcium has emerged as a common nutrient to supplement for PMS. Because calcium regulation and calcium deficiency can actually mimic some PMS symptoms, supplemental calcium has been tested as a treatment. An important multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 479 women who were given either 1200 mg of calcium carbonate or placebo for three menstrual cycles.77 A significantly lower symptom score was observed in the calcium group during the luteal phase of the cycle for both the second and third cycles. By the end of the third cycle, calcium resulted in a 48% reduction in total symptom scores from baseline compared with a 30% reduction in the placebo group. Other studies also show improvements in PMS symptomatology with calcium supplementation (1000–1336 mg).78,79 In one of the later studies, calcium and manganese supplementation (1336 and 5.6 mg, respectively) improved mood, concentration, and behavior. In another study, 1000 mg/day improved mood and water retention.78


Zinc levels have been shown to be low in women with PMS.80 In a double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial, 50 mg of elemental zinc given on the 16th day of the cycle through the 2nd day of the next cycle was associated with significant improvements in premenstrual symp- toms and, after 3 months, with health-related quality of life.81 Zinc is required for proper action of many body hormones, including the sex hormones, as well as in the control of the synthesis and secretion of hormones. In particular, zinc serves as one of the control factors for prolactin secretion.82 When zinc levels are low, prolactin release increases, and high zinc levels inhibit this release. Hence, in high-pro- lactin states, zinc supplementation is very useful. An effective dose range for zinc supplementation for elevated prolactin levels in women is 30 to 45 mg in the picolinate form.


Although vitamin E research concerning PMS has focused primarily on breast tenderness, a significant reduction of other PMS symptoms has also been demonstrated in double-blind studies.23,83 Nervous ten- sion, headache, fatigue, depression, and insomnia were all significantly reduced. In one double-blind study, patients receiving vitamin E (400 IU/day) demonstrated a 33% reduction in physical symptoms (e.g., weight gain and breast tenderness), a 38% reduction in anxiety, and a 27% reduction in depression after 3 months of use. In contrast, the placebo group reported only a 14% reduction in physical symptoms. The group taking vitamin E also noted higher energy levels, fewer headaches, and fewer cravings for sweets. See Chapter 169 for further research on vitamin E and mastalgia.


Vitamin D has also emerged as a potential contributor to symptoms of PMS. In 2019 a cross-sectional analysis of nearly 1000 young women found plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were inversely associated with the risk for cramps, confusion, fatigue, and other emotional symptoms, but unrelated to all symptoms (e.g., acne, bloating, depression, etc.).84 A nested case-control study from within the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort found that dietary intake of vita- min D was also inversely related to risk. Women in the highest quin- tile of intake (median 706 IU/day) had a 41% lower risk for PMS than women in the lowest quintile (median intake of 112 IU/day).85 An intervention study that enrolled nearly 900 adolescent girls found that high-dose supplementation improved PMS and related symp- toms; unfortunately, blood levels were not determined in this study, so it is difficult to determine how dependent any improvement is on serum levels of vitamin D.86

## Essential Fatty Acids

Women with PMS have been shown to exhibit abnormalities in essen- tial fatty acids and prostaglandin, the chief abnormality being a decrease in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA).87 GLA is derived from linoleic acid. This conversion requires adequate levels of vitamin B 6 , magnesium, and zinc because these nutrients function in delta-6-desaturase, the key enzyme responsible for this conversion. Given that a deficiency of one or more of these nutrients is common in PMS, decreased GLA levels could almost be expected. Evening primrose, black currant, and borage oils contain GLA, with typical levels being 9%, 12%, and 22%, respectively. Although these sources of essential fatty acids are quite popular, the research on GLA supplements in the treatment of PMS shows no benefit over placebo. In the four double-blind, crossover, controlled trials of eve- ning primrose oil, this issue may have been complicated by a very high response in the placebo group.88,89 One of these studies used 3 g/day, and the others used 4 g/day. A meta-analysis of the clinical trials of evening primrose oil concluded that it is of little value in the manage- ment of PMS.88

## Multiple Vitamin and Mineral Supplements

A high-quality multivitamin/multimineral supplement providing all of the known vitamins and minerals can serve as a foundation on which to build. Women with PMS have two very sound reasons for taking a high-potency multiple vitamin: • Nutritional deficiency is relatively common among women with PMS. • High-potency multivitamin/multimineral formulations have been shown to have significant benefits in PMS. The frequency of nutritional supplementation and the calculated intake of select nutrients have been shown to be much lower in patients with PMS than in normal women. Women with PMS have been shown to consume vitamins in their food at levels close to the recommended daily allowance, but compared with women who did not have PMS, their intake levels were only 2.2% as much for thiamin, 2.2% for riboflavin, 16.7% for niacin, 8.7% for pantothenic acid, and 2.7% for pyridoxine.23 Several double-blind studies have shown that patients with PMS who were given a multivitamin/multimineral supplement containing high doses of magnesium and pyridoxine experienced reductions (typ- ically at least a 70% reduction) in both premenopausal and postmen- strual symptoms.72,73

## -Tryptophan

As discussed earlier in this chapter, decreases in serotonin may be the cause of PMS or at least may exacerbate PMS. Tryptophan is a precur- sor to serotonin. Studies using l-tryptophan in daily doses of 6 g/day for 17 days from ovulation to day 3 of menses have shown significant reductions in mood swings, insomnia, carbohydrate cravings, tension, irritability, and dysphoria.90,91 Because 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) has shown superior results to tryptophan in depression, it may also prove to be a more effective option for raising serotonin levels in PMS. For more information, see Chapter 87.


Many plants have been used throughout traditional botanical medi- cine for cyclic premenstrual symptoms. These have tended to include what are called reproductive tonics, adaptogens, liver detoxification herbs, and “hormonal balancing” herbs. Unfortunately, these botani- cal approaches have not been the subject of clinical evaluation. Instead, modern research has focused on the following botanicals for relief of PMS symptoms: chaste berry, St. John’s wort, and Ginkgo biloba.

## Vitex agnus castus (Chaste Tree)

The chaste tree (Vitex agnus castus) is native to the Mediterranean, where its berries have long been used for women’s health. Chaste berry extract is probably the single most important herb in the treatment of PMS, not only because of its long tradition and known historical uses but also as a result of modern scientific research. In two surveys of gynecological practices in Germany, physicians graded chaste berry extract as good or very good in the treatment of PMS. More than 1500 women participated in the studies.92,93 One third of the women experienced complete resolution of their symptoms, and another 57% reported significant improvement. The beneficial effects of chaste tree in PMS and these other condi- tions appear to be related to alterations in gonadotropin-releasing hor- mone and follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone. In other words, it appears that chaste berry extract has profound effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary function. As a result, it is able to normalize the secretion of other hormones—for instance, reducing the secretion of prolactin and reducing the estrogen:progesterone ratio. In a more recent study, a randomized clinical trial compared a chaste tree standardized extract (20-mg tablet standardized for cas- ticin) with placebo in women with PMS.94 One hundred and seventy women with PMS were assigned to take either the chaste tree or a pla- cebo once daily for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Women were asked to rate changes in PMS symptoms, such as irritability, mood changes, anger, headache, breast tenderness, and bloating. At the end of the trial, women taking the chaste tree reported a 52% overall reduc- tion in PMS symptoms, compared with only 24% for those taking a placebo. Women taking the chaste tree extract reported significantly greater reductions in irritability, mood changes, anger, headache, and breast tenderness than the women taking the placebo. Bloating was the only symptom that did not change significantly with chaste tree. Another study has looked at the effectiveness of chaste tree extract ver- sus fluoxetine in decreasing PMS symptoms and found the two treat- ments to have comparable results, with the main difference being that fluoxetine was more effective in treating psychological symptoms and chaste berry was more effective with physical symptoms.95 In more recent research, Chinese women suffering from moderate to severe PMS were studied in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled, parallel-group multicenter clinical trial.96 The chaste tree extract contained 4.0 mg of dried ethanolic (70%) extract. The mean total Premenstrual Syndrome Diary (PMSD) score decreased from 29.23 at baseline to 6.41 at the end of the third cycle for the chaste tree group and from 28.14 at baseline to 12.64 at the end of the third cycle for the placebo group. The difference in the PMSD score from baseline to the third cycle was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group. The Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Self-Rating Scale decreased from 26.17 at baseline to 9.92 for the treatment group and from 27.10 to 14.59 for the placebo group—similar positive results as the PMSD scores. PMS is also very common in perimenopausal women. A study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of St. John’s wort and chaste berry in the treatment of PMS-like symptoms in peri- menopausal women.97 This clinical trial was conducted over 16 weeks, and information rating PMS scores in perimenopausal women who were experiencing irregular menses was collected at 4-week intervals. The daily dose of herbal products given was 3 tablets containing 5400 mg of St. John’s wort standardized to contain 990 mcg hypericin, 9 mg hyper- forin, and 18 mg flavonoid glycosides. The daily dose of chaste tree was one tablet of an extract equivalent to 1000 mg of dried fruit. Participants recorded the severity of their PMS symptoms using the Abraham Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire. Results for the active treatment group were statistically superior to placebo for total PMS-like symptoms as well as subgroups of PMS depression and PMS food cravings. In 2017 a systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed 14 random- ized controlled trials of V. agnus castus for the treatment of PMS; of the 14 trials reported a positive and large pooled effect, suggesting a high likelihood of clinically meaningful benefit. However, the high risk of bias and publication bias noted in this systematic review call for high-quality trials to clarify its efficacy as well as to determine whether there are optimal doses and/or forms of administration.115 For exam- ple, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 162 women with PMS found that 20 mg per day of a dry 60% ethanol extract was more effective than 8 mg per day but not more effective than 30 mg per day.98 Two other systematic reviews also published in 2017 found that Vitex is likely to have therapeutic benefit for women with PMS.99,100

## Ginkgo biloba

Several compounds and mechanisms of Ginkgo may be involved in physical and psychological benefits for PMS (see Chapter 82). In the first randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating G. biloba extract (GBE) in PMS, 165 women of reproductive age who had fluid retention, breast tenderness, and vascular congestion were assigned to receive either a GBE of 25% Ginkgo flavone glycosides at 80 mg twice daily or a placebo from day 16 to day 5 of their cycles. Symptom diaries kept by patients and physician evaluation of symptoms demonstrated that G. biloba extract was effective against the congestive symptoms of PMS, particularly breast pain and breast tenderness.101 In a subsequent study, GBE was evaluated using Beck’s Depression Inventory, a daily symptom rating questionnaire containing 19 PMS symptoms according to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), and items relative to the inclu- sion criteria included participants experiencing the symptoms for at least two consecutive cycles before the study and experiencing at least 5 of the 19 symptoms for most of the time during the last week before menses. Eighty-five women completed the study. Participants were given 40 mg three times daily of a standardized GBE or a placebo from day 16 of their cycle to day 5 of their next cycle. The overall severity of symptoms in the GBE group was 34.80% before the treatment, which fell to 11.11% after the treatment. In the placebo group, the baseline severity was 34.38%, which dropped to 25.64% after intervention. The severity of the psychological and physical symptoms also declined sig- nificantly in both groups, but there was again a significant difference between the two groups, in favor of the GBE.102

## Hypericum Perforatum

Owing to the influence of St. John’s wort on serotonin (see Chapter 88), it should not be surprising that this herb would be an important botanical in the treatment of PMS, and research has affirmed this. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of women with regular menstrual cycles and mild PMS was done in which women were randomly assigned to receive St. John’s wort tablets (900 mg/day and standardized to 0.18% hypericin and 3.38% hyperforin) or placebo for two menstrual cycles.103 After a 1-month no-treatment cycle, women were crossed over to the opposite group for two addi- tional cycles. Symptoms were rated using the Daily Symptom Report, State Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Aggression Questionnaire, and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Numerous hormones and physiological markers were also measured in the follicular and luteal phases: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hor- mone (LH), estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, testosterone, cytokine, interleukins (ILs; IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8), interferon, and tumor necro- sis factor-alpha. St. John’s wort was statistically more beneficial than a placebo in relieving food cravings, swelling, poor coordination, insomnia, confu- sion, headaches, crying, and fatigue. There were no significant effects of

## 1746SECTION 6 Diseases

St. John’s wort compared with placebo in any of the biochemical blood measurements. St. John’s wort was not statistically more beneficial in anxiety, irritability, depression, nervous tension, mood swing, feeling out of control, and pain-related symptoms during two cycles of treat- ment. However, these pain-related symptoms appeared to improve more than with a placebo toward the end of each treatment period. In a prospective, open, uncontrolled observational study, women who were diagnosed with PMS completed a daily symptom rating questionnaire for one menstrual cycle and underwent a screen- ing interview with physicians. The participants then took St. John’s wort tablets (300 mg St John’s wort standardized to 900 mcg of hyper- icin) for two complete menstrual cycles.104 Symptoms were rated daily by means of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and modi- fied Social Adjustment Scale, which were administered at baseline and after each of the two cycles. The degree of improvement in over- all PMS scores between the beginning of the study and the end was 51%, with more than two thirds of the women having at least a 50% decrease in the severity of symptoms. The mood subscale showed the most improvement (57%); the symptoms with the greatest reductions in scores were crying (92%), depression (85%), confusion (75%), feeling out of control (72%), nervous tension (71%), anxiety (69%), and insomnia (69%). In a more recent prospective, double-blind, ran- domized, controlled trial, 170 women with PMS were given St. John’s wort (two tablets, each standardized to 680 ug hypericin per day) or a placebo. At 8 weeks, a 40% reduction in total symptom scores was observed, with the largest improvements occurring for crying (71%) and depression (52%).105

## Saffron (Crocus sativus L.)

Saffron has been previously shown to have an antidepressant effect in women with mild to moderate depression through a serotonergic mechanism, so it is not surprising that it would be beneficial in PMS. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done to study whether saffron could be used to relieve PMS symptoms. Fifty women of repro- ductive age with regular menstrual cycles and PMS symptoms for at least the last 6 months were randomly assigned to receive 15 mg of saf- fron twice daily or placebo twice daily for four full menstrual cycles.106 The Daily Symptom Report and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to evaluate the response. According to the Daily Symptom Report, 19 of the 25 women in the saffron group responded with at least a 50% reduction in severity of symptoms versus only 2 of 25 in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). A significant difference between the saf- fron and placebo groups occurred between the third and fourth cycles and was statistically significant by the end of the study (P < 0.0001). According to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 15 of 25 women in the saffron group responded to treatment versus only 1 of 25 in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Again, a significant difference was seen between the third and fourth cycles, with a statistically significant dif- ference by the end of the study (P <0.0001).

## Curcumin

Only recently have clinical trials been conducted to evaluate the effects of this anti-inflammatory component of Curcuma longa. A randomized and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in which either placebo or 100 mg b.i.d. curcumin was given 7 days before and until 3 days after menses among 70 young women. Both behavioral and physical symptoms were significantly improved, with total PMS scores dropping to approximately 40% of their pretreatment levels following curcumin therapy. The authors suggest that curcumin’s effect on norepinephrine levels may help to explain its benefit.116 A second publication by the same authors (which appears to be from the same study) found that curcumin also nearly doubled levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) over the 3-month study period, which may also explain its effect, because a decline in BDNF levels has been observed among women with PMS and may precede the onset of symptoms.107,108

## Bioidentical Progesterone Therapy

Bioidentical progesterone, also called natural progesterone, is a white crystalline powder most often made by extracting diosgenin from Mexican wild yam and then converting this in a manufacturing labo- ratory into a progesterone molecule that is biochemically identical to the body’s own progesterone. It is not wild yam, nor should it be con- sidered an herbal product. What makes natural progesterone “nat- ural” is not so much that it is made from plant material, but rather that it is identical to the progesterone hormone produced in a wom- an’s ovaries. Conventional medical practitioners have historically used a synthetic version, called progestin, which is found in birth control pills as a hormonal treatment for PMS. This has largely been replaced by using select antidepressants for their effect on serotonin levels. Although bioidentical progesterone has been studied in con- trolled clinical trials for the treatment of PMS, efforts to consistently demonstrate the superiority of progesterone therapy over placebo have failed (possibly because there is a significant placebo response in PMS).109–112 The studies showing positive effects have used dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily as a vaginal or rectal suppository from 14 days before the expected onset of menstruation until the onset of vaginal bleeding.113,114 Transdermal creams of natural progesterone generally sold in natural foods/nutrition stores have been a popular self-treatment for PMS. These products vary greatly from an herbal wild yam cream only to wild yam cream with bioidentical progester- one added, up to 20 mg per ¼ tsp. Side effects are few and tend to be generally mild, but they may occur in 4% to 5% of individuals using transdermal creams that include 20 mg of USP progesterone per one-quarter teaspoon. In one of the later double-blind studies that did show a positive effect for progesterone therapy (400 mg twice a day by vaginal or rectal administration), adverse events were reported by 51% of patients in the progesterone group compared with 43% in the placebo group.114 Irregularity of menstruation, vaginal itching, and headache were reported more frequently by the women taking the progesterone.


The approach to the woman with premenstrual symptoms first involves an evaluation of symptoms and the establishment of a diagnosis. In an effort to clarify the treatment approach, the clinician should consider the following seven key steps: 1. Evaluate PMS symptoms by having the patient complete a ques- tionnaire, and ideally 2 consecutive months of symptoms tracking (e.g., Daily Record of Severity of Problems [DRSP]). 2. Rule out psychiatric or other medical conditions. 3. Have the patient adopt the following dietary recommendations for PMS: A vegetarian, low-fat, low-sugar, low-salt, high-fiber diet is advised; if there is mastalgia, caffeine should be avoided. 4. The patient may also benefit from the guidelines for nutritional supplementation given in the following section. 5. Select the appropriate herbal support. 6. Establish a program for stress reduction and recommend regular exercise. 7. If, after at least three complete periods, the patient is not experi- encing a significant improvement or complete resolution of symp- toms, additional causative factors should be sought, as detailed previously, or change made to the treatment program.

## 1749CHAPTER 213 Proctologic Conditions

anterior abscesses drain radially from their points of origin. The presence of a rectal fistula or abscess may point to an internal bowel disease such as diverticulitis, trauma to the area, or immune system incompetence, as with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Under normal conditions, the highly vascularized rectal mucosa is able to provide adequate protection against the spread of infection. The weak points are the anal glands; however, because they may become impacted with fecal matter, setting up an infective process in the anal crypt and intersphincteric space. The surrounding perianal tissue is swollen, red, and painful to palpation. If the infection remains in the intersphincteric space, the patient has rectal pain seemingly without specific findings. Eliciting the pain with pressure upon examination may provide a clue to the source of the lesion. The patient may also present with a fever of unknown origin. The adjacent ischiorectal fossae are regions filled with fatty tissue that allow for distention of the rectum. Therefore an abscess has many different directions in which to track, setting up areas for pockets of pus. In a true perianal abscess, incision and drainage are usually not recommended because the bulk of the lesion would remain untouched owing to the probable invasion of the underlying tissues and the pro- pensity of such an access to form caverns of pus. Unlike other abscesses formed by the body, perianal abscesses should not be allowed to come to a head and rupture on their own; such an occurrence can lead to excessive inflammatory necrosis of the anal sphincter. Generally, a surgical consultation is warranted for a rectal abscess. Surgery allows for opening of the tract and healing by secondary intention. However, localized treatment can be undertaken to help the abscess drain if it has ruptured on its own or the patient presents acutely and immediate referral is not possible. Such treatment affords some relief and helps decrease the morbidity associated with this con- dition. Irrigation with herbal antibacterial agents such as Hydrastis, Usnea, and Calendula succus in 0.9% saline helps drainage. Another often-encountered scenario is that of folliculitis with resultant abscess formation. These abscesses can be incised and drained because they do not involve the anal canal or ischiorectal fossa. Homeopathic medicines such as calcarea sulphuricum, silicea, hepar sulphuris, and Myristica are some of the medicines indicated most often. Poultices made of onion, garlic, or potatoes exert a drawing action, bringing the lesion to a head faster. Alternating hot and cold sitz baths are also useful. Once the abscess has broken open or has been incised and drained, irrigation with the previously mentioned solution hastens healing.

## Anal Cryptitis

Anal crypts are pockets created between the grooves formed by the rectal columns at their distal points ending at the dentate line. The anal glands empty into the crypts and, as previously mentioned, are believed to be the source of anal fistula. That anal cryptitis is a separate entity is open to some debate, and it is rarely seen. The patient com- plains of pain that is worse with bowel movement. Examination shows localized tenderness and redness at the dentate line, and there may be some rectal spasm. Rectal fissure should be ruled out. Chronic cases suggest bacterial infection, usually gonorrhea. Treatment is by herbal suppository, sitz baths, increased dietary fiber intake, and, if necessary, localized anesthesia. The crypt may be cleaned out with a crypt hook if needed and irrigated with a solution of C. succus and Hydrastis in normal saline.

## Anal Fissure

An anal fissure is a slit-like separation of the anal mucosa lying below the dentate line. The majority of fissures are found in the posterior midline region (70%–80%), but anterior midline lesions (10%–20%) are more commonly seen in women. Some investigators report that fis- sures are more common in men than women,4 but other studies do not bear this out.5 In some patients, the anal sphincter is more oval than round, coming to a Y or narrow point at the posterior midline, making for a greater predisposition for anal fissure. Anal fissure in children is not all that uncommon, often being associated with chronic diarrhea or hard stool.6 Fissure may also be a complication of a lesion associated with a congenital anal deformity. Lesions located in the anteroposte- rior vertical axis suggest an internal bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease, squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the rectum, syphilitic fissure, or ulceration due to tuberculosis. Anal fissures are very painful because of their somatic innervation, which results from spasm of the anal sphincter in response to stretch- ing during the passage of stool. The presence of an anal fissure triggers a vicious cycle of pain, causing sphincter spasm, which contributes to a tightening of the sphincter and increased pain with the passage of stool. Patients usually have severe pain during and for some time after defecation, and bleeding is not uncommon. As the lesion enlarges, it may ulcerate and become infected. Conventional medical treatment consists of rectal dilation, internal sphincterotomy, electrodessication, or surgical excision.5 Anal fissure can be caused by the passage of large, hard stools; childbirth trauma; chronic diarrhea; trauma; food allergy; or pro- longed straining to pass stool. Infants and young children who con- sume large amounts of cow’s milk are more likely to have anal fissures and chronic constipation, especially if they were breastfed for a shorter period.7 Many of the patients in whom anal fissures develop display intense, compulsive personalities that may contribute to the formation of such fissures and the ability to heal. A previous anal or rectal opera- tion, syphilis, or Crohn’s disease also predisposes the patient to fissure development. Examination may be difficult because of the pain and spasm, and anoscopic examination is often out of the question unless anesthesia is used. A localized injection of 1% or 2% lidocaine into the rectal sphincter at the 3-o’clock and 9-o’clock positions can help relax it enough for an examination to occur. One can often see anal fissures without using an anoscope simply by pulling back on the anal skin and examining the tissue. The presence of a sentinel pile or enlarged papilla suggests chronic anal fissure and is the result of inflamma- tion and the body’s attempt to protect the inflamed area. Anal spasm may be marked, making it difficult to perform an examination, and anal stenosis and fibrosis may be present if the condition has been chronic. Clinicians should consider the presence of Crohn’s disease, espe- cially if the patient is younger, there is a history of periodic or chronic diarrhea, and the fissure lies in the anteroposterior vertical axis. Squamous cell carcinoma, syphilitic ulcers, and rarely tuberculosis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. Spasm of the levator ani muscle may also make one think of anal fissure, but no lesion is present in this case. Treatment of anal fissure can prove to be one of the more diffi- cult courses of therapy for both the patient and the clinician. Although surgical intervention removes the lesion and alleviates the pain, the lesion invariably returns because the underlying cause has not been addressed. Additionally, surgical intervention often predisposes to fecal incontinence later in life. Therefore medical management both in the short and long terms is necessary for complete resolution. Patients must be cautioned that the healing of a rectal fissure has its periods of exacerbation and remission and that continuing with the treat- ment protocol is important despite the periodic setbacks that are often encountered. Educating the patient on this point upon initiation of therapy is essential to its success.

## Treatment

Initial treatment should be to alleviate the pain and spasm because they have often brought the patient to the office. Homeopathic med- icines provide prompt relief if the simillimum is found and aids the healing process. Remedies such as Chamomilla, graphites, nitric acid, Ratanhia, Sepia, silicea, and Thuja are some of the more often indi- cated medicines, but others may also be needed.8,9 Frequent dosing is generally the rule. Protease 315 mg, two capsules three times daily between meals and again before bed, will help alleviate pain as well. A preparation of 0.2% glycerol trinitrite can be used topically to relieve rectal spasm,10 as can 5% lidocaine cream for localized pain. Glycerol trinitrite has been shown in a number of studies to be effective in reliev- ing rectal spasm and increasing blood flow to the anal sphincter.11–13 Reduced blood flow to the anal sphincter has been postulated as one of the precipitating mechanisms for the development of an anal fissure. A topical cream consisting of vitamins A and E, panthenol, Calendula, and Comfrey will considerably enhance the healing process by providing nutrients essential for healing by secondary intention. Some of the commercial preparations also contain boric acid, which acts as a styptic. Initially, the cream should be applied topically after every bowel movement and at bedtime. As healing occurs, twice-daily application usually suffices until the lesion has resolved. Iontophoresis using a zinc electrode and applying a positive current helps facilitate healing by hardening the underlying fissure, decreasing bleeding, and affording pain relief.14 The patient lies on the negative dispersing pad, and current is applied for 10 minutes at 10 mA. The patient should be instructed not to strain during the passage of stool and to use cotton balls that have been moistened with water rather than toilet paper or chemical or alcohol wipes. Some patients are excessive cleaners; they should be instructed that it is unnecessary to wipe deep into the anal canal because doing so makes the condition worse. Sitz baths also aid in the healing process by providing increased blood flow to the area. If performing a sitz bath is not possible, alter- nately spraying hot and cold water on the perineal area will achieve the same result.15 Increasing dietary fiber is necessary if the condition is due to chronic constipation, whereas chronic diarrhea can be managed through a variety of therapeutic approaches once the cause is found. Dietary changes are a must, especially if the anal fissure is associated with irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s disease. The higher rates of hemorrhoids and Crohn’s disease seen in blood group O individuals are believed to be due to food intolerance.16 As previously mentioned, the clinical course varies from patient to patient and seems to depend partially on whether the patient follows the treatment plan religiously. Frequent follow-up is needed to assess the healing process and reassure the patient. Once healing has occurred, proper bowel function and good dietary and bowel habits must be maintained in order to prevent further epi- sodes. Patients who experience an anal fissure are at risk for further episodes.

# HEMORRHOIDS

Affliction from hemorrhoids has been noted in the writings of various cultures throughout history—Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Egyptian, and Hebrew. In the United States and other industrialized countries, hemorrhoidal disease is extremely common. Although most indi- viduals may begin to have hemorrhoids in their 20s, hemorrhoidal symptoms usually do not become evident until the fourth decade of life.17,18 Estimates have indicated that 50% of persons older than years have symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease at one time or another, and up to one third of the total U.S. population has hemorrhoids to some degree.19 The causes of hemorrhoidal disease are similar to those of varicose veins. As with varicose veins, predisposition to the development of hemorrhoids depends on genetic makeup. Excessive venous pressure, pregnancy, long periods of standing or sitting, straining at stool, and heavy lifting are considered the major factors. Most patients have more than one predisposing factor.20 Because the portal venous system contains no valves, factors that increase venous congestion in the perianal region can precipitate hem- orrhoid formation. They include increasing intraabdominal pressure (e.g., defecation, pregnancy, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, physical exertion, and portal hypertension as a result of cirrhosis), an increase in straining during defecation, and standing or sitting for prolonged periods. Presenting symptoms are itching, burning, irritation with the pas- sage of stool, swelling of the anus and perianal region, blood on the toilet paper or in the bowl, and seepage of mucus. Most patients attri- bute all rectal symptoms to hemorrhoids; however, internal hemor- rhoids are only rarely painful or cause itching. Usually the hallmark of a hemorrhoidal eruption is bleeding or protrusion noted after the passage of stool. Pain from internal hemorrhoids occurs when they become strangulated from prolapse and with thrombosis. Any other pain associated with hemorrhoids is usually the result of a coexisting lesion, such as a fissure. Itching is rarely associated with internal hem- orrhoids except if there is excess mucous discharge.

## Classification

Hemorrhoids are typically classified according to location and degree of severity. External hemorrhoids occur below the anorectal line. They may be full of either blood clots (thrombotic hemorrhoids) or con- nective tissue (cutaneous hemorrhoids). A thrombotic hemorrhoid is produced when a hemorrhoidal vessel has ruptured and formed a thrombus, whereas a cutaneous hemorrhoid consists of fibrous con- nective tissue covered by anal skin. Cutaneous hemorrhoids can be located at any point on the circumference of the anus. Typically, they are caused by the resolution of a thrombotic hemorrhoid; that is, the thrombus becomes organized and replaced by connective tissue. Internal hemorrhoids occur above the anorectal line. Occasionally an internal hemorrhoid enlarges to such a degree that it prolapses and descends below the anal sphincter. Internal hemorrhoids are graded by the degree of prolapse. Grade I: No prolapse Grade II: Prolapse upon defecation but spontaneous reduction Grade III: Prolapse upon defecation and manual reduction Grade IV: Prolapsed and no reduction possible Internal-external, or mixed, hemorrhoids are a combination of contiguous external and internal hemorrhoids that appear as baggy swellings. The following types of mixed hemorrhoids can occur: • Without prolapse: bleeding may be present, but there is no pain. • Prolapsed: characterized by pain and possibly bleeding. • Strangulated: the hemorrhoid has prolapsed to such a degree and for so long that its blood supply is occluded by the anal sphincter’s constricting action; strangulated hemorrhoids are very painful and usually become thrombosed.

## Treatment

In contrast to the United States and the United Kingdom, hemorrhoids are rarely seen in parts of the world where high-fiber diets containing unrefined foods are consumed.19 A low-fiber diet high in refined foods contributes greatly to the development of hemorrhoids. Individuals consuming a low-fiber diet tend to strain more during bowel

## 1751CHAPTER 213 Proctologic Conditions

movements because their smaller and harder stools are more difficult to pass. This straining raises the pressure in the abdomen, obstructing venous return. The greater pressure will increase pelvic congestion and may significantly weaken the veins, causing hemorrhoids to form. A high-fiber diet is perhaps the most important component in the prevention of hemorrhoids. A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and grains promotes peristalsis because many fiber components attract water and form a gelatinous mass that keeps the feces soft, bulky, and easy to pass. A high-fiber diet leads to significantly less straining during defecation. Natural bulking compounds can be used to reduce fecal straining. These fibrous substances, particularly psyllium seeds and guar gum, possess a mild laxative action owing to their ability to attract water and form a gelatinous mass. They are generally less irritating than wheat bran and other cellulose fiber products. Several double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated that supplementing the diet with bulk-form- ing fibers can significantly reduce the symptoms of hemorrhoids (bleeding, pain, pruritus, and prolapse) and improve bowel habits.21,22 The use of psyllium seed fiber has been shown to afford significant relief in bleeding and pain within 6 weeks in hemorrhoid suffers.23 A placebo-controlled randomized study evaluated the efficacy of fiber supplements in 50 patients with bleeding internal hemorrhoids. Patients in the study group were treated with a commercially available preparation of Plantago ovata, and those in the control group were treated with a placebo. Endoscopy was performed in every patient before and after treatment to establish the degree of hemorrhoidal prolapse and the numbers of congested hemorrhoidal cushions and contact-bleeding hemorrhoids. During the first 15 days of treatment, the average number of bleeding episodes was 4.8 ± 3.8 for the study group versus 6.4 ± 3 for the control group (NS). During the following 15 days, it decreased to 3.1 ± 2.7 in the study group versus 5.5 ± 3.2 (P < 0.05) in the control group, and in the last 10 days of treatment, a further reduction to 1.1 ± 1.4 was found in the study group com- pared with 5.5 ± 2.9 in the control group (P < 0.001). The number of congested hemorrhoidal cushions diminished from 2.6 ± 1 to 1.6 ± 2.2 after fiber treatment (P < 0.01), but no differences were found in the control group. In the fiber group, hemorrhoids bled on contact in 5 out of 22 patients before treatment and in none after treatment; no differences were found in the control group. No modification of the extent of prolapse was observed after treatment.24 Although the effect took a few weeks to develop, the final results were very impressive. Another important, but only recently recognized, dietary factor is breakfast. An age-, gender-, and pregnancy-matched case-control study carried out in an outpatient clinic found a remarkable 7.5-fold increase in the odds of suffering from hemorrhoids or anal fissures in matched subjects who did not eat breakfast!25 Flavonoid preparations have been shown to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of hemorrhoids through their strengthening effect on venous tissues. Although early studies primarily used rutin, later research has used hydroxyethylrutosides (HERs). Several of the studies have been performed in pregnant women, where HERs were shown to be of great benefit in helping to relieve hemorrhoidal signs and symptoms. In one study, 90% of the women given HERs (1000 mg daily for 4 weeks) experienced improvement of symptoms, compared with only 12% in the placebo group.26 Similar results in hemorrhoids not associated with pregnancy have been reported.27,28 Another study provided a micronized flavonoid combi- nation (diosmin 90% and hesperidin 10%) for a median of 8 weeks before delivery and 4 weeks after delivery to 50 pregnant women with acute hemorrhoids. Their therapy was very successful, with 66% of patients reporting relief from symptoms by the fourth day of treatment and fewer suffering relapses during the antenatal period.29 Treatment was well accepted and did not affect pregnancy, fetal development, birth weight, infant growth, or feeding. In most circumstances, topical treatments for acute or chronic hemorrhoids involving the use of suppositories, ointments, and ano- rectal pads provide only temporary relief. Many over-the-counter products for hemorrhoids primarily contain natural ingredients, such as witch hazel (Hamamelis), cocoa butter, Peruvian balsam, zinc oxide, allantoin, and homeopathic preparations. Many patients use hydro- cortisone cream to help with the itching that they associate with hem- orrhoids; prolonged use of this agent can often aggravate the pruritus ani, setting up a cycle of continued use.


Botanical medicines have had a long history of use for hemorrhoids. They can be used topically, administered as suppositories, or taken orally to support redundant tissue and facilitate healing. The use of rectal suppositories after galvanic, infrared, or laser therapy helps facil- itate healing and decrease bleeding. Some of the more commonly used botanical medicines are discussed later in this chapter.

## Hydrotherapy

The warm sitz bath is an effective noninvasive treatment for uncompli- cated hemorrhoids.15,18 Although a warm sitz bath is a useful treatment for an acute hemorrhoidal flare-up, alternating hot and cold sitz baths are better suited to facilitate the healing of chronic conditions.

<!-- chunk -->

## Surgical Treatment

Various surgical and nonsurgical methods of treating hemorrhoids exist, the choice of which often depends on the stage of the hemor- rhoid and the expertise of the physician. Stage I or II hemorrhoids can often be managed medically, especially if they are acute. Herbal rectal suppositories, along with the indicated homeopathic medicine, often aid in quick resolution of the flare-up. In uncomplicated cases of stage I or II hemorrhoids, unless the patient is exhibiting symptoms, treat- ment is usually not recommended except for increasing dietary fiber and addressing the patient’s dietary choices. Injection of sclerosing agents is useful in stage I and stage II hemor- rhoids, but such treatment is contraindicated in patients with anal fis- sure, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, leukemia, or portal hypertension. Sclerosing therapy is not usually effective against stages III and IV hemorrhoids. Rubber-band ligation of hemorrhoids is a widely used in-office procedure that removes redundant tissue and causes scarring, which is then replaced by new tissue. Following such treatment, patients often have a sense of fullness or pressure in the rectum, and pain occurs if the band is placed too close to the pectinate line. Postbanding bleeding can occur, and there have been reports of complications resulting in septi- cemia and death.20 Rubber-band ligation is used primarily for stage I, stage II, and occasionally stage III hemorrhoids; its success is largely a function of the physician’s ability to place the bands. Cryosurgery involves the application of liquid nitrogen or nitrous oxide to the hemorrhoid, which causes destruction of the venous plexus, scarring, and eventual tissue replacement. Used primarily for stage II and stage III hemorrhoids, the procedure is also useful if condyloma is present. It is contraindicated for stage IV hemorrhoids, chronic ulcers, and acutely thrombosed hemorrhoids. Pain, swelling, and bleeding may occur after cryosurgery. Hemorrhoidectomy, or the surgical removal of redundant tissue, is by far the most invasive of the hemorrhoidal procedures. It often requires an outpatient surgical setting and causes the patient to lose time from activities of daily living so that healing can take place. Most patients seek alternative treatments in order to avoid surgery and its complications, such as pain and instability of the rectal sphincter. The monopolar direct current technique for the management of hemorrhoids is becoming a significant treatment of choice in the

## 1752SECTION 6 Diseases

United States.30 According to a report by Machicado et al.,31 this pain- less outpatient treatment of all grades of hemorrhoids is effective and safe. This methodology warrants consideration as the treatment of choice for hemorrhoidal disease. The first published work on monopolar direct current (also called inverse galvanism) was published by Keesey32 of Chicago. Dr. Keesey dated the first use of this approach to 1897, although the techni- cal problems (producing a smooth, uninterrupted galvanic current source) were not worked out until approximately 1925. The tech- nique then came into use in general practice. Monopolar ablution of hemorrhoidal tissue lost favor in conventional medicine, not because it was ineffective, but because newer techniques and advances in sur- gery made it less attractive. If the naturopathic medical schools had not been teaching the Keesey treatment over the last 60 years, it is very possible that this irreplaceable technique would have been lost to the healing arts. A later study showed that direct-current electrotherapy also relieves the chronic anal fissures often associated with internal hemorrhoids. All 10 of the patients in the reported study experienced relief of chronic anal pain within two treatments, and anal fissures healed in within 4 weeks. One patient experienced a perianal abscess and fistula, requiring surgery. There were no recurrences in 20 months (mean) of follow-up.31 The monopolar direct current technique is purely an office proce- dure. No anesthesia is needed except a local anesthetic for the occa- sional hypersensitive or nervous patient (in such instances, a 2% procaine solution is injected directly into the hemorrhoid). To date, there have been no reported cases of stricture or metastatic abscesses, a fact that speaks well for the procedure’s safety. The chemicophysiological action, which causes the absorption and destruction of a vein, is responsible for the permanence of the cure. The mechanism of action of monopolar direct current is well under- stood. When introduced into the interior of the hemorrhoid, the neg- ative pole of the galvanic current makes contact with the water of the blood and tissues and generates hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions. The hydroxide destroys the organized structure of the hemorrhoid and its capillary circulation. This produces first a hydrolysis and then a hard- ening of the hemorrhoid. The final disappearance of the hemorrhoid is brought about in one of two ways. It is either absorbed like any bodily contusion or, if the hemorrhoid is large, it ruptures, causing a discharge of the thrombosed elements into the rectum, followed by a contraction of the residual hemorrhoidal tissues. What makes the Keesey technique attractive is that the patient may be freely ambulant after completion of the procedure and can return to his or her normal activities. The hemorrhoid disappears 7 to 10 days after the treatment. Each separate hemorrhoid is treated in the same manner, and larger hemorrhoids may have to be treated more than once. Generally it is a good policy to treat only one hemorrhoid or at most two at a time because of the healing that must occur and the higher risk of bleeding with the treatment of several. Infrared coagulation (IRC) is effective with stage I and stage II hemorrhoids but can be combined with the Keesey treatment for stage III and stage IV lesions. Whereas the Keesey technique uses current, the infrared coagulator uses a burst of intense heat generated inter- nally and shot through a blue anodized sapphire tip to the surface of the hemorrhoid. The IRC “coagulates” the redundant tissue to a depth that is a function of the duration of the light burst, usually 1 to 1.5 seconds. As with the Keesey technique, a 7- to 10-day period of heal- ing should occur between treatments. Many naturopathic physicians who use the Keesey treatment also incorporate IRC because doing so usually reduces the number of treatments needed per hemorrhoid. Compared with rubber-band ligation, laser therapy, and cryotherapy, IRC has been shown to produce better results and less morbidity.33–35

## Prevention

As with all diseases, the primary treatment of hemorrhoids is pre- vention. This involves reducing factors that may be responsible for increasing pelvic congestion, such as straining during defecation, sit- ting or standing for prolonged periods, and underlying liver disease. A high-fiber diet is crucial for the maintenance of proper bowel activity, and nutrients and botanical substances that enhance the integrity of venous structures may also be of benefit. Warm sitz baths and topical preparations are useful to ameliorate the discomfort but have only transient results. A diet high in complex carbohydrates that are rich in dietary fiber is indicated. The diet should contain liberal amounts of proanthocyanidin- and anthocyanidin-rich foods, such as blackberries, cherries, and blueberries, to strengthen vein structures. Supplements such as vitamins A and B complex, anti- oxidants such as vitamins C and E, and zinc will help maintain vascular integrity and facilitate healing. When indicated, the monopolar direct current method, specifi- cally designed for the treatment of hemorrhoids, will give permanent results. This technique is especially useful in advanced hemorrhoidal disease and, when coupled with the necessary diet and lifestyle changes, considerably decreases the likelihood of recurrence.

# EXTERNAL HEMORRHOIDS

External hemorrhoids occur when there is dilation of the external rec- tal plexus or thrombosis after an episode of constipation, diarrhea, or heavy lifting or the Valsalva effect from sneezing, coughing, or child- birth. The patient notices a perianal lump, which is often painful, and some bleeding may be associated with it. External hemorrhoids usu- ally pose mild to little discomfort and largely resolve on their own if homeostasis is restored. External anal skin tags found on examination are the remnants of previous external hemorrhoids. If, however, the hemorrhoid becomes thrombosed, a cycle of acute edema and pain is set up that may lead to surgical intervention. As the lesion becomes increasingly distended, varying degrees of pain and swelling can arise, which are often exacerbated by the passage of stool or by prolonged sitting. The patient may report bleeding after stool, which is the result of a disruption of the hemorrhoid.36 A prolapsed internal hemorrhoid should also be considered as part of the differential diagnosis for external hemorrhoid, as should peri- anal abscess, rectal fissure with sentinel pile, hypertrophied anal papil- lae, irritated skin tag, condyloma latum, and condyloma acuminata.

## Treatment

Unless the hemorrhoid has thrombosed and the patient is in exces- sive pain, an external hemorrhoid can usually be managed medically. Initial treatment should be to relieve the pressure and dissolve whatever thrombosis has formed. As healing occurs, long-term management in the form of patient education, dietary changes, and enhancement of vascular integrity should be undertaken to help prevent further episodes. Initial treatment with the enzyme protease 315 mg, two cap- sules between meals three times daily and two at bedtime, will help reduce the thrombosis and decrease pain. Alternating hot and cold sitz baths act to relieve pain and increase blood flow. A number of homeopathic medicines, such as Aesculus, aloe, Hamamelis, muri- atic acid, Ratanhia, and Sepia,8,37 are effective in relieving pain and speeding the course of healing. A clinical repertory or materia med- ica should be consulted because there are numerous remedies that will provide relief. Long-term management should involve identification and removal of the precipitating cause and education of the patient as to the cause and how to prevent further episodes. Dietary changes to eliminate

## 1753CHAPTER 213 Proctologic Conditions

offending foods while increasing dietary fiber in the form of fruits and vegetables or an over-the-counter fiber supplement are warranted. Herbal medicines such as Aesculus, Collinsonia, Hamamelis, and Althea or Ulmus38 will help restore venous sufficiency and soothe inflamed tissues. In some cases, regulation of bowel function with the use of herbal laxatives may be necessary while normal intestinal and colon function is restored. Various commercially available herbal medicines and fiber compounds are effective. In patients who are experiencing an acute episode of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid, prompt surgical excision or incision is in order. Because the external skin is innervated by somatic nerves, adminis- tration of anesthesia is needed before evacuation of the clot. Excision leaves a wound that should not be sutured but should be allowed to heal by secondary intention, although this causes greater postoperative pain. Incision and debridement of the clot allow for less pain, but the wound may close too early, leading to re-formation of the thrombus. A text on minor surgery for diseases of the rectum and colon should be consulted as to the proper surgical technique. Starting the patient on herbal anodynes such as Piscidia, belladonna if pain is a result of rectal spasm, and Hyoscyamus niger can facilitate postoperative management. Healing and pain relief can be afforded with the topical use of Arnica, Hypericum, and in particular C. succus. Alternating hot and cold sitz baths with ½ oz of povidone-iodine added enhances healing and helps reduce the chance of infection. As with medical treatment, protease 2400 milk clotting units (MCUs) can be added for pain relief. Homeopathic agents such as Arnica, Calendula, and staphisagria should also be considered for pain relief.

# PERIANAL DERMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS

<!-- chunk -->

## Condylomata Acuminata

A patient presenting with condylomata acuminata may complain of a sticking or foreign-body sensation perianally. If the lesion is large enough, defecation can be interfered with, and hygiene can become a problem. The lesion is usually soft, moist, reddish pink, and pedun- culated. Differentiation from condylomata lata of secondary syphilis is necessary because the treatments differ, and the potential for trans- mission is greater with the latter disorder. A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test with reflexive fluorescent treponemal antibodies (FTAs) is war- ranted. If dark-field microscopic examination is available, it should also be performed. Diagnosis of condylomata acuminata is made through biopsy. A solution of 25% podophyllum that is applied topically for 6 to hours, after which it is washed off by the patient, has been shown to be effective. Several applications may be necessary in order to eradicate the lesion.39 Cryosurgery is also available, as is IRC after subcutaneous injection of 1% or 2% lidocaine.40 Although naturopathic and homeo- pathic philosophy decries the “suppression” of lesions as contributing to a deepening of the disease process, concomitant administration of the proper homeopathic medicine coupled with a good nutritional program rarely causes this to happen. The administration of homeopathic Thuja is often indicated, but a number of other homeopathic remedies cover genital warts. The tak- ing of a constitutional case not only helps with the eradication of the lesion but also acts to decrease the patient’s susceptibility to the devel- opment of further lesions, which can often happen.

<!-- chunk -->

## Condyloma Lata

Condyloma lata, or anogenital wart, is caused by human papillo- mavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 and is transmitted by sexual contact. Lesions appear as soft, moist, pink to gray, flat to pedunculated excrescences frequently found in clusters. More often located in warm, moist regions of the anogenital region, they are more commonly found clustered around the anus in homosexual men and in women who practice anal intercourse.41 Lesions must be differentiated from the flat lesion seen with the condyloma lata of secondary syphilis. A diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma should be considered if the lesion does not respond to ther- apy, or biopsy can be performed.42 Various naturopathic therapies are available, among them being treatment with 25% podophyllum, Thuja ointment, homeopathic pre- scription, cryotherapy, IRC, and electrosurgical dessication.43

## Lymphogranuloma Venereum

The infective agent in lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is one of the serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis, and the lesion may first appear as a papule that ulcerates and heals rapidly. If the primary lesion is in the rectal mucosa, the patient presents with the signs and symptoms of proctitis. This is then followed by the development of inguinal adenitis or buboes that are extremely painful. The later stages may manifest as fistulization, ulceration, fibrosis, and rectal or anal stenosis and can lead to lymphedema of the legs and genitalia. Non-LGV Chlamydia serotypes can also be implicated in proctitis but generally do not have as severe presenting symptoms. White blood cell counts may reach 20,000/mm3 if there is lymphatic involvement, and the patient may exhibit anemia. Culture of the chla- mydial serotype from an infected lesion is diagnostic, but complement fixation and immunofluorescent antibody tests are available.44 If LGV is treated promptly, the prognosis is good; but once the dis- ease has begun to create cellular changes, the prognosis becomes worse because the degree of pathology can be considerable. For the most part, allopathic treatment consists of antibiotics such as doxycycline, eryth- romycin, and sulfisoxazole, all of which have been found to be effec- tive against LGV.44 Various homeopathic and herbal medicines can be used. See treatments under “Proctitis.”

## Herpes

Probably the most commonly encountered perianal lesion, herpes sim- plex typically manifests as a burning, searing pain that may be con- fused with that of a rectal fissure. Examination reveals vesicles on an erythematous base that soon erode and form ulcerations. In patients with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions, the lesions can form deep ulcerations and have a prolonged course. Diagnosis is by Tzanck smear or viral culture. Initially, treatment protocols should address the current eruption because longer-term prevention strategies usually take time to work. Topical preparations consisting of deglycyrrhized licorice (DGL) and Melissa officinalis extracts can help alleviate local symptoms of burning and pain and facilitate the healing process. Zinc sulfate 2% has also been used topically with some success. Various homeopathic medi- cines not only address the pain and eruptions but also help decrease the patient’s susceptibility to further outbreaks. Stress reduction is important as well, because herpes eruptions often occur during periods of excessive stress or other illness. Long-term strategies include decreasing the arginine-containing foods in the diet, such as nuts, legumes (especially peanuts), and choc- olate. Supplementing lysine at 500 to 1000 mg/day is useful in eliminat- ing outbreaks. Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and B complex vitamins, zinc, and copper have all been shown to be of benefit.

## Pilonidal Sinus

Pilonidal sinus is a rare congenital tract that runs from the coccyx or sacrum to the perineum with constant drainage. Both congenital and

## 1754SECTION 6 Diseases

acquired factors play a role in the development of a pilonidal sinus. The condition is most commonly seen in young white adults, rarely in black persons, and almost never in Asians. Congenital postanal dim- ples predispose to the formation of a pilonidal tract, as do obesity, a deep intergluteal cleft, and excess body hair. The condition is usually differentiated from anal fistula and furun- culosis because of its midline orientation and through the passing of a probe through the sinus, noting its passage toward the sacrum rather than the anus. Patients seek treatment because of the often-chronic nature of the discharge. If the sinus becomes infected, incision and drainage may be needed, but irrigation with the herbal formula mentioned for abscess can be performed. Weight reduction and removal of excess hair in the region also helps reduce the risk of infection and symptoms. Homeopathic medicines selected according to the presentation, such as silicea, calcarea sulphuricum, and hepar sulphuris, have proved use- ful. Additionally, homeopathic Thuja as an intercurrent treatment has resolved a number of obstinate cases.

## Proctalgia Fugax

Proctalgia fugax, or levator spasm syndrome, is more common in men than women and manifests as pain, often searing, near the coccyx or rectum that lasts for a brief but intense period, usually resolving on its own. The episode often wakens the person from sleep but may occur at any time. Caused by a spasm of the levator ani or pubococcygeal muscle, proctalgia fugax produces a deep-seated and often heavy, aching, or searing pain that feels as if it were localized in the rectum and/or pros- tate in men. Examination reveals a tense and tight levator ani mus- cle that is tender with pressure and is often drawn up above the anal sphincter. Mechanisms that are thought to trigger an episode are poor pos- ture, chronic anxiety, and mental fixation on the rectal area, as well as misalignment of the coccyx or other bones composing the pelvic bowl. Differential diagnosis includes lumbar disc disease, coccygodynia, prostatitis, presacral tumor, developing ischiorectal abscess, spinal cord tumor, and rectal lesion. Treatment often takes the form of reassuring the patient as to the etiology of the condition. Muscle relaxants and hot packs may be of benefit. Spinal and pelvic bone adjustments may also be of use, as is massage to the lower abdomen, lumbosacral spine, and perineum. Chronic cases often respond to deep tissue work, such as Rolfing.

## Proctitis

Proctitis usually manifests as rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal discharge, and blood in the stool. White blood cells may be present in large num- bers, being evident on wet preparation, Gram stain, or Wright stain. Because there are various causes for the inflammation, an anoscopic examination is warranted to examine the rectum for inflammation, mucopurulent discharge, mucosal friability, bleeding, and ulceration. Severe ulceration and bleeding are associated with infection by the LGV Chlamydia serotype. Among the causative agents are Chlamydia (usually of the genital immunotypes but also the LGV immunotypes), yeast, bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, parasites, trauma, lectins, excessive fiber in the diet, external irradiation, syphilis, Trichomonas, and Crohn’s disease. One study demonstrated a higher risk for the development of ulcerative proctitis in smokers and persons who had had an appendectomy.45 Determination of the etiological agent dictates the course of treat- ment and expected outcomes. If the cause is external-beam irradiation for colon cancer or radium seed implants for prostate cancer, the ther- apy should commence before cancer treatment and continue during it and for several weeks after treatment has ceased. In a study examining the effects of radiation and antioxidant therapy,46 it was demonstrated that a “substantial number of patients with radiation proctitis seem to benefit from antioxidant therapy.” Despite admonitions by radia- tion oncologists that antioxidant therapy should be discontinued, a review by Lamson and Brignall47,48 demonstrated no ill effects when radiation was combined with antioxidant therapy. As part of the ther- apeutic regimen for radiation proctitis, concomitant administration of homeopathic radium bromatum 200c before and after treatment helps decrease skin burning. Other homeopathic medicines may also be indicated, such as X-Ray, Sol, and cadmium metallicum. Additionally, the use of demulcent rectal suppositories helps soothe the inflamed rectal mucosa and decrease pain. If the proctitis is secondary to an inflammatory bowel condition, treatment of the underlying disease results in healing of the rectum as well. This can be accomplished by addressing the patient’s diet, providing adequate fiber, and administering herbal demulcents and enteric-coated peppermint to soothe the inflamed intestinal tract. Short-chain fatty acids administered rectally were shown in one study to alleviate symptoms of proctocolitis, and a deficiency of such acids should be considered as part of the clinical presentation.49,50 In cases in which an infective agent such as bacteria, Chlamydia, yeast, fungi, trichomonas, or a parasite is identified as the etiological agent, a variety of naturopathic treatments have been found empir- ically to be effective. Among them are the injection of ozone; herbal suppositories; homeopathic medicines; and a retention enema consist- ing of Hydrastis, Usnea, Echinacea, yarrow for Trichomonas, and Althea in a base of 0.9% NaCl. This combination can be applied topically during the initial examination to begin treatment. Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, as previously mentioned, facilitate healing. As a general rule, treatment of proctitis should continue for 10 to days before reexamination and assessment. In cases of ulcerative disease, treatment may need to be continued longer to allow for complete healing.

## Pruritus Ani

Pruritus ani is characterized by chronic itching of the perianal skin with excoriation from scratching and an eventual thickening of chron- ically affected areas. Patients often scratch at night during sleep or are awakened from sleep by the itching. Patients may complain of inter- mittent to constant itching, burning, and soreness that often awaken them at night. The use of topical ointments may provide some relief, but symptoms return when they wear off. Examination may show varying degrees of erythema, swelling, excoriation, thickening, and fis- suring as a result of scratching. The stage is set for the development of pruritus ani when the skin’s normal protective barriers have broken down. Various agents contrib- ute to this process, such as excessive wiping with harsh toilet papers; use of “wipes” that are impregnated with drying alcohol, dyes, and antibacterial or fungal agents; reactions to synthetic undergarments or detergents used to launder them; and the wearing of too-tight under- clothing, which decreases air circulation. Patients with chronic diar- rhea or loose stools are at increased risk because of the stools’ often acidic nature.51,52 In some cases, removal of normal hair growth for cosmetic purposes also contributes because it disrupts the normal bac- terial flora in this region of the body. Pinworms and Candida are the two most common infecting agents in pruritus ani. In particular, a history of perianal itching largely at night should alert the physician to the possibility of Enterobius ver- micularis infestation (pinworms). This is a common etiological agent in children and can be spread to other members of the family with con- siderable ease. A wet preparation will demonstrate Candida, and a clear adhesive tape preparation for pinworms helps establish the diagnosis.

## 1755CHAPTER 213 Proctologic Conditions

Patients with episodes of periodic or chronic diarrhea are also at increased risk of pruritus ani. It can occur because of the acidic nature of the stool but most often is caused by aggressive cleaning of the area afterward. Compulsive cleaners should be instructed on the use of cot- ton wipes, bath or shower cleansing, or the use of moist towels. The frequent use of soaps, detergents, bleaches, dyes, or perfumes can also contribute to the development of pruritus ani. A recent onset may be the result of a change in a product, and the physician should ask about it. Certain foods that frequently aggravate the condition are peanuts, coffee, colas, beer, and spicy foods.5,20 Highly acidic foods and foods that are responsible for an allergic reaction in the patient should be suspected and eliminated for several weeks. Psoriasis, contact dermatitis, precancerous or cancerous lesions, Bowen’s disease (interepithelial epithelioma), keratoacanthoma, mel- anoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma can also cause pruritus ani. Laboratory tests to consider are culture and sensitivity testing if bacterial infection is suspected, a potassium hydroxide and/or wet preparation to look for yeast or fungi, Wood’s lamp examination for Tinea cruris, and a punch biopsy for suspicious lesions.53

# TREATMENT OPTIONS

Treatment options in anorectal disorders include the elimination of spicy or offending foods or of food allergies and improvement of the patient’s digestion. If an infective agent is identified, a course of topi- cal therapy to remove the yeast, fungi, or bacteria should be initiated. Initial washing with 3% hydrogen peroxide followed by application of a topical herbal formula containing Usnea, Hydrastis, Spilanthes, oregano, and tea tree oil, which is then allowed to dry, helps eliminate the infective agents. In order to reestablish the skin’s defensive barrier, this step should be followed by a healing salve containing Calendula, comfrey, and vitamins E and A. Relief should be obtained within 7 to 10 days if the underlying cause has been eliminated. For pinworms, numerous naturopathic treatments have proved to be effective. Additionally, all clothing and bedding should be washed in warm to hot water to eliminate the eggs that have been laid outside the rectum at night. Various homeopathic medicines are also effective and may help prevent future episodes in chronic cases. Having the patient use moist cotton wipes after stool and eliminating excess moisture in the perineal area helps break the circle. The topical application of zinc oxide also has proved effective in the treatment of pruritus ani.

## Botanicals

Botanical medicines have been used in the treatment of anorectal diseases throughout history by many different cultures. Many of the plants used by the various folk traditions are of the same genus, varying by species only, whereas others are unique to their loca- tions. More recent examinations of the various botanical medicines have elicited their chemical properties and actions, but the eclec- tic and herbalist traditions have also placed an importance on the symptom specificity of the medicine. Doing so enhances its healing effect. Aesculus hippocastanum is classified as a tonic, astringent, febrifuge, narcotic, and antiseptic. High in tannic acid and aesculin, this herbal medicine is good for pain relief of internal viscera and is indicated for hemorrhoids and rectal irritation when there is marked congestion and a sense of spasmodic closing of the rectum as if there were a for- eign body present. Additionally, it is effective for itching, a sensation of heat, aching, and rectal pains. It has also been found to be useful for rectal neuralgia and proctitis.38 Achillea millefolium (yarrow) possesses slightly astringent prop- erties and is an alterative and diuretic. It acts as a tonic on mucous membranes to stem the flow of mild hemorrhage; thus, it is used for bleeding hemorrhoids, especially if they are accompanied by mucoid discharges.38 Althea officinalis (marshmallow) is high in mucilage, which helps restore the electrical charge to inflamed rectal mucosa. It is often put into rectal suppositories because of its ability to decrease swelling, irri- tation, and inflammation.38 Cinnamomum (cinnamon) is commonly found in herbal rectal suppositories because of its ability to stem hemorrhaging.38 Collinsonia canadensis (stone root) is an alterative, tonic, stim- ulant, and diuretic. It is used primarily for its effects on the venous system because it tones vascular tissue. It is especially indicated for hemorrhoids caused by chronic constipation and venous insufficiency. Patients so affected have a sense of constriction, weight, and heat in the rectum and pass very dry stools. It is also useful for proctitis, anal fistulas, and rectal ulcer.38 Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) is primarily a tonic and astrin- gent. It affects the venous system by restoring vascular integrity; there- fore it is an excellent medicine for varicose veins, hemorrhages, and hemorrhoids. Indications for its use are venous tissues that are pale and in varying states of flaccidity but may also possess a deep redness because of vascular engorgement and stagnation of blood flow. The hemorrhoidal tissues are usually very painful and may have a tendency to ulceration.38 Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) contains hydrastine, berberine, canadine, and acrid resins. It exerts its action upon the mucous mem- branes and affects the healing of ulcerations while controlling mild hemorrhages; it also has antibacterial properties. Additionally, it has an astringent effect upon hemorrhoids. Goldenseal is indicated for hem- orrhoids caused by constipation, accompanied by a sinking feeling in the stomach and a dull headache, and for anal fissures that are painful, with severe burning before, during, and after stool.9,54 Ruscus aculeatus (butcher’s broom) acts upon the venous system, where it reduces swelling and has a vasoconstrictive action, thus reduc- ing bleeding.55

## Homeopathic Medicines

Various homeopathic medicines have historically been used in the treat- ment of anorectal diseases. A few key symptoms manifesting during the initial consultation will often guide the practitioner to the correct medi- cine, thus decreasing the need to take a full constitutional case.

# TREATMENT SUMMARY FOR HEMORRHOIDS

As with all diseases, the primary treatment for hemorrhoids is preven- tion. This goal involves reducing the factors that may be responsible for increasing pelvic congestion, such as straining during defecation, sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time, or underlying liver disease. A high-fiber diet is crucial for the maintenance of proper bowel activity. Fiber supplements, flavonoids, and various botanical medicines such as butcher’s broom are appropriate supplementary measures. Warm sitz baths and topical preparations are useful to ameliorate the discomfort but have only temporary effects.


A high-complex-carbohydrate diet rich in dietary fiber is recom- mended. The diet should contain liberal amounts of flavonoid-rich foods, such as blackberries, citrus fruits, cherries, and blueberries, to strengthen vein structures.

## 1758SECTION 6 Diseases

novel antimicrobial peptides produced by the microbiome of the skin may play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. And similarly to the gut microbiome and associated diseases, poor bacterial diversity and strain-level variations could be key determinants of the psoriatic microbiome.8,9 The commensal microbiota of the skin also play an important role in the maintenance of skin-barrier function, inhibition of the invasion of pathogens, formation of biofilms, production of antibacterial peptides, and prevention of transepidermal water loss.10 Beta-hemolytic streptococci and Malassezia ovalis have both been found to also play roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.11,12 Pre- and probiotics exert immunomodulatory effects on skin and can strengthen its barrier function by decreasing the skin bacterial load as well as opposing aggressive commensals.13 These findings support the idea of a direct link between gut and skin microbiota and imply that a probiotic can modulate the natural microbiota for therapeutic purposes. Research supporting such a claim comes from anecdotal evi- dence documenting a positive therapeutic response of pustular psoria- sis to the administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus.14

## Gastrointestinal Comorbidities

A large proportion of comorbid conditions linked to psoriasis involve the GI tract, including pathologies of the oral cavity, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, increased intestinal permeability, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.15 Common oral psoriatic lesions involve the mucosal surfaces of the tongue, cheeks, and gums. The incidence of geographical tongue in psoriatic patients is estimated at 5.6% to 18.1% and may reflect the severity of psoriasis. Fissured tongue is another nonspecific oral pathology found in 6% to 47.5% of patients psoriasis.

## Inflammatory Bowel Disease

The association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with psoriasis can be at least partially explained by a common genetic background. All loci-determining predispositions to both conditions have been found in the 6P212 region encompassing the major histocompatibil- ity complex. Also, the genes encoding IL-23R and IL-12B are impli- cated in the pathogenesis of both IBD and psoriasis. And both diseases share the same inflammatory pathways in which Th-17 cells and T-regs play a pivotal role.16 There is an apparent paradoxical iatrogenic link between psoriasis and IBD. It has been reported that some patients with IBD have developed psoriatic lesions during the course of anti- TNF treatment with monoclonal antibodies.

<!-- chunk -->

## Celiac Disease

Genetic, physiological, epidemiological, and serological links between celiac disease (CD) and psoriasis have been documented.17 There is a common genetic background between psoriasis and CD. Genome-wide association studies of these two conditions identified genetic susceptibility loci at eight genes regulating innate and adap- tive immune responses.18 Both CD and psoriasis involve an increase in intestinal permeability.19,20 Malabsorption resulting from CD may predispose to vitamin D deficiency, which is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis as well as correlate with psoriasis sever- ity.21 Th1 and Th17 cells play major roles in the pathogenesis of both psoriasis and CD.22 Some wheat antigens may trigger an immune response in patients with psoriasis significantly more often than in nonpsoriatic controls, inducing expression of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA).23 Prompted by the discovery of significantly higher mean immu- noglobulin (Ig) A antigliadin antibodies (AGAs) in a cohort of patients with psoriasis compared with a reference group, Michaëlsson et al. evaluated the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) response to a gluten-free diet in patients with positive AGA tests.24,25 The IgA-AGA- positive group of patients adhering to a gluten-free diet were noted to have a highly significant reduction in PASI compared with the IgA- AGA-negative group. Notably, 60% of IgA-AGA-positive patients experienced a worsening of their psoriasis when they reintroduced their habitual diet. None of the IgA-AGA-negative patients noted any changes in their psoriasis after resuming their habitual diet.26 The inves- tigators then evaluated histological skin changes in psoriatic and unaf- fected skin of patients with psoriasis with or without positive IgA and/ or IgG AGA on a gluten-free diet. After eating a gluten-free diet for months, patients had a significantly decreased dermal Ki-67+ cell popu- lation (an indicator of cell proliferation) in lesional skin. The reduction of the Ki-67+ cell population in unaffected skin was statistically signif- icant in the dermis, whereas in epidermal regions, a gluten-free diet led to a reduction in Ki-67 positivity, although it was not statistically signif- icant. The areas of psoriatic skin expressing Ki-67 showed no regression with the gluten-free diet. Dermal tissue transglutaminase, notably 8× more concentrated in lesional skin compared with uninvolved skin, also decreased by 50% after a gluten-free diet in AGA-positive patients. The gluten-free diet also led to a significant reduction in the lesional CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of AGA-positive patients. No significant changes were noted in the skin of AGA-negative patients after a gluten-free diet. Interestingly, approximately 50% of the AGA-positive patients did not show endoscopic evidence of CD before implementation of the

gluten-free diet, which suggests that such diet may be also beneficial in patients with psoriasis with asymptomatic gluten sensitivity.27


Cadmium is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and is toxic at even low levels. Cadmium also causes the elevation of inflammation markers and influences the immune system. It has been hypothesized that cadmium would be positively associated with the severity of pso- riasis. To clarify the relationship between cadmium and psoriasis, participants, ≥ 20 years of age, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2006 were studied.28 Psoriasis severity was assessed using self-reported dermatology questionnaires. Cadmium was measured using blood chemistry. Patients with psoriasis had significantly higher blood cadmium (0.67 vs. 0.52 μ g/L, p = 0.006), and there was a strong linear increase in predicted blood cadmium val- ues with an increase in severity of psoriasis (p for trend = 0.002). In addition, patients with psoriasis living in a cement factory area had significantly higher mean values of cadmium, chromium, nickel, and lead in scalp hair, blood, and urine samples compared with refer- ents, whereas the concentration of zinc was lower in the scalp hair and blood but higher in the urine samples of patients with psoriasis. It was concluded that the deficiency of zinc in patients with psoriasis may be caused by the toxic element exposures via the cement factory.29

## Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is diagnosed in up to 30% of the population, coinciding with obesity. It is established as a cardio- vascular risk factor, is essentially due to insulin resistance, and is thus a common manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Inasmuch as obesity and metabolic syndrome are common in patients with psoriasis, it is not surprising that a high incidence of NAFLD is observed with psori- asis. NAFLD correlates with greater severity of psoriasis, and patients with both conditions are at a higher risk of developing liver fibrosis than nonpsoriatic controls.30 Some proinflammatory cytokines syn- thesized by lymphocytes and keratinocytes in psoriatic skin, including IL-6, IL-17, and TNF- α , contribute to systemic insulin resistance.31 Lifestyle factors, such as cigarette smoking and alcoholism, and iat- rogenic factors, such as methotrexate and systemic corticosteroids, should also be considered as fueling this vicious cycle. Preliminary evi- dence exists that patients with psoriasis are at higher risk of cancers, specifically of the GI tract, but this issue requires further study.32

## Advanced Glycation End Products

Glycation is a deleterious phenomenon in diabetic complications. One of the underlying features of hyperglycemia is the excessive nonen- zymatic glycation of the two major circulating proteins: hemoglobin and albumin. This chemical process consists of a complex cascade of reactions between glucose and its derivatives with proteins, yielding a heterogeneous class of compounds termed advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGE formation and accumulation in tissue is a physiological pro- cess that gradually occurs during aging but accelerates in states of constant hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and oxidative or carbonyl stress, which are common in patients with moderate to severe psoria- sis. Exogenous AGEs may come from foods, ultraviolet (UV) irradia- tion, and cigarette smoking. AGEs activate receptors on epithelial and inflammatory cell surfaces. They amplify inflammation by stimulating the release of cytokines and chemokines and the production of reac- tive oxygen species and activating metalloproteases. AGE levels are increased in the skin and blood of patients with severe psoriasis inde- pendently of associated metabolic disorders. Intensified glycation of proteins in psoriatic skin is thought to play a role in fueling cutaneous inflammation. AGEs released from psoriatic skin may also increase metabolic and cardiovascular risk in patients with severe disease. The increased keratinocyte proliferation in psoriasis results in increased demand and consumption of glucose, suggesting that AGEs play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. AGEs activate monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells that then produce proinflammatory cytokines and additional AGE, stoking the inflam- matory response.33

## Homocysteine and DNA Methylation

Numerous studies have built a foundation for how homocysteine-in- duced impairment is the common pathway in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and its increased cardiovascular risk and aberrant DNA methylation. However, this area of research remains incomplete, and it is not possible at this time to provide high-quality, evidence-based guidance on how to translate this to clinical practice.34 Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean and Paleolithic diets can reduce the risk of cardiometabolic comorbidities in psoriasis.35,36

## Inflammatory Leukotrienes

Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites have been of keen interest as pos- sible contributors to the local inflammatory milieu of psoriasis and as promising therapeutic targets. Consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids modulates AA metabolism and has been found to moderately improve symptoms of psoriasis.37

## Depression

Psoriasis does not need to be widespread to be severe. The impact of lesions on the hands, face, genitals, and/or scalp can be very traumatic. Psoriasis can be stigmatizing, and the emotional scar from the condi- tion can still affect quality of life long after the disease is controlled. The main contributors to depression in patients with psoriasis are female gender, beliefs about appearance and its salience to one’s self-worth, greater psychological distress, and lower levels of emotional social sup- port. The impact on patients’ lives and well-being is often higher than in other skin and chronic diseases. Extensive evidence describes the co-occurrence of psoriasis and depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and alcoholism.38,39 Considering all of these comorbidities, an interdisciplinary, com- prehensive, holistic management plan is necessary.40 It is known that psoriasis develops in bone marrow transplant recip- ients from donors with psoriasis, clears in recipients from donors with- out psoriasis, and responds positively to various stem cell therapies,41 and that immunosuppressive drugs are effective in reducing psoria- sis.42,43 Given the genetic predisposition to this disease, what can be done to reduce the phenotypic expression besides resorting to immunosup- pressive and biological therapies with their attendant side-effect profiles? It is interesting that researchers have recognized “unidentified anti- gens” as ostensibly being the source of the psoriatic cascade. Although a clear relationship of psoriasis with conditions like CD44 and Crohn’s disease45 has been reported, the intestinal mucosa of patients with pso- riasis without GI symptoms has shown microscopic lesions and greater intestinal permeability, even when the mucosa appeared macroscopi- cally normal.46,47 Given information regarding bowel toxemias, food allergies, and low proteolytic and bile enzymes, as well as suboptimal liver function and food allergies (see the following sections), a plau- sible naturopathic suggestion here would be to consider that factors leading to poor intestinal function most likely encourage greater intes- tinal permeability and inflammation, which ultimately allow these antigenic and endotoxic compounds to leave the intestinal confines, travel through the bloodstream, and initiate activated immune cas- cades in susceptible tissues.

## 1760SECTION 6 Diseases


Although psoriasis has a significant genetic component, a decrease in the source of blood-borne antigenic immune activators can be sub- stantially achieved through natural medicine intervention. Several controllable factors appear to cause or contribute to etiological bases and pathogenesis of psoriasis, as follows: • Incomplete protein digestion • Bowel toxemia • Impaired liver function • Bile deficiencies • Alcohol consumption • Excessive consumption of animal fats • Nutritional deficiencies • Stress

## Gastrointestinal Function

<!-- chunk -->

## Incomplete Protein Digestion

Incomplete protein digestion or poor intestinal absorption of protein breakdown products can result in elevations of amino acids and poly- peptides in the bowel. These are metabolized by bowel bacteria into several toxic compounds. The toxic metabolites of the amino acids arginine and ornithine are known as polyamines (e.g., putrescine, spermidine, and cadaverine) and have been shown to be higher in indi- viduals with psoriasis. Polyamines inhibit the formation of cyclic ade- nosine monophosphate and therefore contribute to the excessive rate of cell proliferation (Fig. 214.3).48–50 Lowered skin and urinary levels of polyamines are associated with clinical improvement in psoriasis.48 A number of natural compounds can inhibit the formation of poly- amines and may be of benefit in the treatment of psoriasis. For example, vitamin A and the alkaloids of Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) such as berberine inhibit bacterial decarboxylase, the enzyme that converts amino acids into polyamines.51,52 However, the best way to prevent the excessive formation of polyamines is to evaluate digestive function with the aid of Heidelberg Gastric Analysis and/or a comprehensive digestive stool analysis and then take the action necessary (e.g., hydrochloric acid supplementation) to ensure complete protein digestion and absorption (these assessment methods can be found in Chapters 17 and 28).

## Bowel Toxemia

A number of gut-derived toxins are implicated in the development of psoriasis, including endotoxins (cell-wall components of gram-neg- ative bacteria), streptococcal products, Candida albicans, yeast com- pounds, and IgE and IgA immune complexes.53-55 Endotoxins have been found in high levels in the blood of patients with psoriasis,56 and these compounds lead to increases in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels within skin cells, thereby increasing the rate of keratino- cyte proliferation dramatically. A diet low in dietary fiber is associated with increased levels of gut-derived toxins.53 Dietary fiber is critical to maintaining a healthy colon. Many fiber components bind bowel toxins and promote their excretion in the feces. It is therefore essential that the diet of an individ- ual with psoriasis be rich in beans, fruits, and vegetables. Natural com- pounds that bind endotoxins and promote their excretion may also be used. For example, an aqueous extract of the herb Smilax sarsaparilla was found in a 1942 study to be effective in psoriasis, particularly the more chronic, large-plaque–forming varient.57 In this controlled study of 92 patients, S. sarsaparilla greatly improved the psoriasis in 62% of the patients and resulted in complete clearance in another 18% (i.e., 80% of the subjects experienced significant benefits). This benefit is apparently due to S. sarsaparilla’s components’ binding to and pro- moting the excretion of bacterial endotoxins. Because clinical severity and therapeutic response have been shown to correlate well with the level of circulating endotoxins, control of gut-derived toxins is important in the treatment of psoriasis. An effort should be made to promote proper binding and elimination of these compounds through support of their excretion in the feces as well as proper handling of absorbed endotoxins by the liver.

## Liver Function

The correction of abnormal liver function may be of benefit in the treatment of psoriasis.58 The connection between the liver and pso- riasis relates to one of the liver’s basic tasks—filtering and detoxifying the blood returning through the portal circulation from the bowels. Structurally, the hepatic architecture may already be altered in patients with psoriasis.59 As mentioned previously, psoriasis has been linked to the presence of several microbial by-products in the blood. If hepatic function is compromised by excessive levels of these toxins from the bowel or if there is a decrease in the liver’s detoxification ability, the systemic toxin level rises, and the psoriasis worsens. Alcohol consumption is known to significantly worsen psoriasis.60 Alcohol has this effect because it both increases the absorption of tox- ins from the gut (by damaging the gut mucosa) and impairs liver func- tion. Alcohol intake must be restricted in individuals with psoriasis. Silymarin, the flavonoid component of Silybum marianum, has been reported to be of value in the treatment of psoriasis.58 Presumably this is a result of its ability to improve liver function, inhibit inflamma- tion, and reduce excessive cellular proliferation.61,62

## Bile Deficiencies

the intestines act to detoxify bacterial endotoxins. In the absence of sufficient amounts of bile acids, endotoxins translocating into the bloodstream can produce pathological conditions that vary in sever- ity depending on their amount, including the release of inflammatory cytokines known to play a role in psoriasis. A fascinating Hungarian study of 800 patients with psoriasis was conducted in which 551 were treated with oral bile acid (dehydrocholic acid) supplementation for 1 to 6 weeks or 3 to 8 weeks for acute or chronic cases, respectively. Conventional therapies were administered to 249 patients as a comparison group. Both groups were advised to eat a diet high in vegetables and fruits and were instructed to avoid hot spices, alcohol, raw onion, garlic, and carbonated soft drinks. Of the 551 patients receiving bile acid, 434 (78.8%) became asymptomatic, whereas only 62 (24.9%) of the 249 patients receiving conventional therapies demonstrated clinical recovery during this treatment period. Additionally, the curative effect of bile acid supplementation was more pronounced in the acute form of psoriasis; 95.1% of the patients in this group became asymptomatic. In follow-up assessments 2 years later, 319 of the 551 patients with acute and chronic psoriasis who had been treated with bile acid (57.9%) were asymptomatic, compared with only 15 of the 249 patients (6%) who had received the conventional treat- ment.56 The bile acid supplements used in the preceding study were either 2 or 3 dehydrocholate sodium (Suprachol) sugar-coated pills once a day or dehydrocholic acid powder (acidum dehydrocholicum pulvis) at two to three doses of 0.25 g/day. Because there is a theoretical risk of malignant tumors in patients with sluggish intestinal function given long-term bile acid therapy, the investigators in this study recommended that their subjects not con- tinue ingesting bile acids on a regular basis but to supplement with them only after a fatty meal once the initial treatment period had been completed. Two separate evaluations of bile acid effects on the prolifer- ation of colonic mucosa report conflicting results.63,64 Two other stud- ies actually found a cancer-protective effect of ursodeoxycholic acid. One was an observational study of 114 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in whom a reduction in the risk for colon adenoma was dis- covered. The prevalence of colorectal adenomas was 13% in the treated group versus 24% in the untreated group. Additionally, the colon epi- thelial cell proliferation index was significantly lower in treated patients than in untreated patients.65 A second randomized controlled clinical trial of 52 subjects found significant declines in the risk for develop- ing colorectal dysplasia or cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.66 More clinical research is needed to examine the different varieties of bile acids and their efficacy as well as their safety profile. Nevertheless, given the preceding information, it seems reasonable to consider the use of bile acids for the short-term treatment of psoriasis and to monitor the colon before and after treat- ment in patients at high risk for colon cancer.

## Nutrition

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids

The manipulation of dietary oils is extremely important in the man- agement of psoriasis because serum levels of free fatty acids are typ- ically abnormal in affected patients.67 Of particular benefit are the omega-3 fatty acids. Most of the clinical research has utilized fish oils rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Several double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated that supple- menting the diet with 10 to 12 g/day of fish oils (providing 1.8 g EPA and 1.2 g DHA) results in significant improvement.68–70 This amount of EPA and DHA would be equivalent to the amount of EPA in about 150 g of salmon, mackerel, or herring. The improvement in psoriasis from EPA is partly due to the compe- tition of EPA for arachidonic acid binding sites, producing leukotriene B5 (LTB5), which is only one tenth as potent as the inflammatory mediator LTB4. Levels of LTB4 have been shown to be elevated in pso- riatic plaques and to demonstrate chemotactic properties necessary for the infiltration of leukocytes and the proliferation of keratinocytes.71 In the skin of individuals with psoriasis, the production of inflamma- tory leukotrienes from arachidonic acid is many times greater than normal.72 Leukotrienes are potent inflammatory agents and promoters of guanylate cyclase activity. In the psoriatic epidermis, the cellular contents of free arachidonic acid and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE; a product of lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid) are 250 and 810 times greater, respectively, than in uninvolved epidermal tissue.72 Immunomodulatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids include the sup- pression of lymphocyte proliferation, CD4 cells, antigen presentation, adhesion molecule presentation, Th1 and Th2 responses, and proin- flammatory cytokine production (such as IL-1, TNF- α , and platelet- derived growth factor [PDGF]), which prevents vascularization within the psoriatic plaque.73 Trauma also induces the release of free arachidonic acid and may account for the common clinical observation of plaques at the sites of repeated trauma. These observations are significant because the increase in 12-HETE stimulates the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, promot- ing leukotriene formation. This pathway is inhibited by EPA and glu- tathione peroxidase, suggesting that a selenium deficiency may be a contributory factor (see later section “Diet, Fasting, and Food Allergy Control”). As might be expected, cyclooxygenase inhibitors (e.g., aspirin and most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) may exacerbate psoriasis, whereas lipoxygenase inhibitors (e.g., benoxaprofen) may bring improvement.74 Naturally occurring substances such as quer- cetin (the ubiquitous plant flavonoid), vitamin E, onion, and garlic are known to inhibit lipoxygenase and therefore may be of benefit. However, it is improbable that selective inhibition of one component or enzyme (e.g., a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) would do more than create an imbalance in this closely integrated network of mediators, which may not necessarily be beneficial.75 Because arachidonic acid is found only in animal tissues, patients with psoriasis may find it helpful to limit their intake of animal prod- ucts, particularly animal fats and dairy products.

## Diet, Fasting, and Food Allergy Control

An evaluation of 316 patients with psoriasis and 366 control sub- jects, both groups being in the age range of 16 to 65 years, found that psoriasis was positively associated with body mass index and inversely related to the intake of carrots, tomatoes, fresh fruits, and the index of beta-carotene intake.76 Research at a Swedish hospital studying the effects of fasting and vegetarian regimens on chronic inflammatory disease found that such diets helped patients with psoriasis.77 The improvement was probably due to decreased levels of gut-derived toxins and polyamines. Patients have also benefited from gluten-free and elimination diets.78,79 Several herbs used as seasonings—including turmeric, red pepper, cloves, ginger, cumin, anise, fennel, basil, rosemary, garlic, and pomegranate—can block the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κ B) of inflammatory cytokines.80

## Individual Nutrients

Decreased levels of vitamin A and zinc are common in patients with psoriasis.81–83 Given the critical roles of these nutrients in the health of the skin, supplementation might be warranted even without this asso- ciation. Retinoids are proven effective in treating psoriasis. There is no evidence that zinc is therapeutic, however.

## 1762SECTION 6 Diseases

Chromium supplementation may be indicated to increase the sen- sitivity of insulin receptors because patients with psoriasis typically have increased serum levels of both insulin and glucose and carry an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.84 Substantial evidence indicates that psoriasis is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.85 It remains difficult to con- clude whether risk factors are caused by psoriasis or share a common pathogenesis. Inflammation, characterized by the presence of proin- flammatory cytokines and endothelial activation, is a common theme underlying these conditions. Dyslipidemia, coronary calcification, increased highly sensitive C-reactive protein, decreased folate, and hyperhomocysteinemia are found significantly more often in patients with psoriasis.86 The inflammatory processes underlying psoriasis suggest the possi- bility of omega-3 fatty acid, folate, and vitamin B 12 deficiencies, which are also found in cardiovascular disease.87 High homocysteine and decreased folate levels correlate with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). The rapid keratinocyte turnover rate in psoriasis may result in folate utilization and subsequent deficiency.88 The authors of one study conclude, “Dietary supplementation of folic acid, B 6 , and B 12 appears reasonable in psoriasis patients, particularly those with elevated homocysteine, low folate and additional cardiovascular risk factors.”89 In supplementing with folic acid or its active form 5-meth- yltetrahydrofolate, the recommended dose is 1 to 5 mg/day, and testing for MTHFR mutations may help guide which form of the vitamin is most advisable. Glutathione peroxidase (GP) levels are low in psoriatic patients, possibly because of such factors as alcohol abuse, malnutrition, and the excessive loss of skin due to the hyperproliferative disease. The depressed levels of GP normalize with oral selenium and vitamin E therapy.90 One investigation found that patients with longer-term pso- riasis (3 years or more) demonstrated low plasma selenium status.91 Another study comparing 113 patients with moderate to severe psori- asis and 104 healthy controls found that male patients between 20 and 49 years of age with psoriasis and women with the disease of longer than 20 years’ duration had particularly low selenium concentrations. The lowest whole-blood selenium values were found in the subgroup of male patients with widespread disease of long duration, who also required treatment with methotrexate and retinoids.92 It has been established that patients with disseminated psoriasis have significantly decreased serum levels of the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) compared with age- and gender-matched controls and also compared with patients with moderate psoriasis.93,94 Whether this is a contributing factor to psoriasis or a result of the disorder has not been elucidated. Keratinocytes in the epidermis convert 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 in the presence of ultraviolet B. Sunlight, ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy, oral calcitriol, and topical vitamin D and its ana- logs are an effective therapy for psoriasis owing to vitamin D’s antipro- liferative and prodifferentiating actions on keratinocytes.95 Vitamin D supplementation enhances the benefit of phototherapy96 and also encourages a shift toward type 2 helper T-cell cytokine expression, with an increase in IL-10 and a decrease in IL-8, which may be respon- sible for the improvements seen in psoriasis.97 Vitamin D analogs like calcipotriol have also been shown to mediate the expression proin- flammatory antimicrobial peptides such as β -defensin and to decrease IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-8 in lesional psoriatic skin.98 Vitamin D con- trols plasmacytoid dendritic cell function,99 and topical calcitriol has also been shown to reduce the number of dendritic cells in the skin.100 Calcitriol binding to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in the skin mod- ulates the expression of a large number of genes, including cell-cycle regulators, growth factors, and their receptors. Polymorphisms of the VDR gene are associated with psoriasis and may predispose to the development of psoriasis and resistance to calcipotriol therapy while also contributing to liver dysfunction in patients with psoriasis.101 Given the importance of vitamin D in psoriasis, cancer, inflam- matory diseases, and other conditions, it has been suggested by some investigators that recommendations for sun protection and skin cancer prevention may need to be reevaluated to allow for sufficient vitamin D status. However, studies conducted in Honolulu, Miami, and south- ern Arizona showed that abundant sun exposure did not necessarily ensure vitamin D adequacy, which points to the need for vitamin D supplementation to achieve optimal blood levels while also protecting the skin from sun damage and skin cancer.102 It has been demonstrated that oral vitamin D can be safely taken in daily doses of up to 5000 IU/day, with some experts recommending up to 10,000 IU/day to correct a deficiency.103

## Fumaric Acid

Over the past three decades, fumaric acid therapy has become increas- ingly popular in Western Europe for psoriasis. Therapy consists of the oral intake of dimethylfumaric acid (240 mg/day) or monoethylfu- maric acid (720 mg/day) and the topical application of 1% to 3% of monoethylfumaric acid. Clinical studies have shown that it is useful in many patients with psoriasis,104 but side effects such as flushing of the skin, nausea, diarrhea, general malaise, gastric pain, and mild liver and kidney disturbances can occur.105 We recommend using fumaric acid therapy only after other natural therapies have proved ineffective.

## Psychological Aspects

Research concerning the role of stress in psoriatic exacerbations is mixed. One investigation revealed that a large proportion (39%) of patients with psoriasis report the occurrence of a specific stressful event within 1 month before their initial episode. Such patients have a better prognosis.106 Yet other findings show a limited relationship between stress and vulnerability to psoriasis, whereby correlation seemed to occur mostly in patients with repeated stressors occurring four times or more in 1 year.107 Stress management can benefit individuals with psoriasis.108 As judged by two independent dermatologists, subjects who listened to a guided meditation tape while undergoing photother- apy cleared four times as quickly as those who received phototherapy only. Psoriasis status was assessed in three ways: direct inspection by unblinded clinic nurses, direct inspection by physicians blinded to the patient’s study condition (tape or no tape), and blinded physician eval- uation of photographs of psoriatic lesions. Four sequential indicators of skin status were monitored during the study: a First Response Point, a Turning Point, a Halfway Point, and a Clearing Point. Subjects in the tape groups reached the Halfway Point (P = 0.013) and the Clearing Point (P = 0.033) significantly more rapidly than those in the no-tape condition for both UVB and psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) treat- ments. Finally, psychotherapy can be an essential adjunct for individ- uals with persistent unresolved psychological issues such as anxiety, depression, and the psychosocial stress of this chronic skin disease. A few case histories have been reported that document the successful treatment of psoriasis with hypnosis and biofeedback alone.109

## Sunlight, Ultraviolet Light, Climatotherapy, and Balneotherapy

Sunlight (which contains UV light) is extremely beneficial for indi- viduals with psoriasis.110,111 Outdoor 4-week heliotherapy was shown to promote significant clearance of psoriatic symptoms in 84% of subjects.112 Studies employing nonprescription commercial tanning beds have shown that a majority of patients find them helpful113; they

also objectively facilitate improvements in both psoriasis severity and health-related quality of life.114 In addition, an open-label retrospec- tive trial studied the combined use of the retinoid acitretin (a vitamin A derivative) along with a 4- to 5-day-per-week tanning regimen; 83% of 23 subjects experienced complete or near-complete recovery.115 Specific UV exposure may also be of benefit owing to its induc- tion of vitamin D synthesis in the skin. The standard UV medical treatment of psoriasis typically involves the use of the drug psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA therapy; 320–340 nm). UVB (280–320 nm) exposure alone also leads to inhibition of cell proliferation; in certain studies, it has been shown to be as effective as PUVA therapy, with fewer side effects.115 At the Dead Sea, where 80% to 85% of psoriatic conditions clear in 4 weeks, UVB wavelengths are known to be the dominant light.116,117 In one investigation of 28 patients, UVB had a clear advantage over PUVA therapy.145 Conversely, another report comparing UVB with PUVA in 100 patients demonstrated clearance of psoriasis in a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with PUVA (84%) than with UVB (63%), and with significantly fewer treatments.118 Other studies have found both to be effective, with sim- ilar untoward side effects.119,120 It is clear that more study is needed to clarify both the risks and benefits of these therapies and whether cer- tain presentations of psoriasis may respond best to a specific ultraviolet therapy. As noted previously, ultraviolet light deactivates vitamin D topical agents, Therefore, if they are used in conjunction, the topical agent should be applied only after ultraviolet treatment. Furthermore, any light therapy should be monitored carefully, especially in patients at risk for skin cancers. There is overwhelming evidence that bathing in the Dead Sea is very effective in the treatment of psoriasis.121 Traditional Chinese medical bath therapy, in combination with UV irradiation, has also been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of psoriasis, as documented in a review of 25 randomized controlled trials.122 A report of a controlled trial of hydrogen-water bathing also showed significant and rapid improvement itching and in PASI score.123 The induction of localized elevation of temperature (42°C–45°C) to the affected area by ultrasound and heating pads has been shown to be an effective treatment of psoriasis.124,125 Italian researchers have con- ducted small clinical trials using a hypotonic sulfate water (Leopoldine water) in a balneotherapeutic manner. These treatments have yielded favorable immunohistological profiles of the affected tissues, with sig- nificant decreases in the numbers of T lymphocytes, Langerhans cells, and markers of keratinocyte inflammatory expression.126

## Stem Cell Therapy

The effect of stem cells in the epidermis and on T cells is recognized as a primary cause of immune dysregulation in psoriasis. Initial attempts at using stem cells in treatment are being explored.127 Umbilical cord– Wharton’s jelly stem cells yielded complete remission of psoriasis in two cases,128,129 confirming that mesenchymal stem cells inhibit the activity of the Th17 cell and reduce expression of IL-17.130 Thirty patients in Ecuador with severe psoriasis were treated by a single intravenous autologous transplant of hematopoietic cells and compared with 19 patients who received PUVA therapy. PASI 75 reached a statistically significant effect in the stem-cell group, but no significant difference was observed in comparison to the PUVA group.131

## Topical Treatments

A number of natural proprietary formulas as well as over-the-counter preparations can be used to provide symptomatic relief in mild to mod- erate psoriasis. The best evidence of effectiveness is found with Indigo naturalis, used to treat psoriasis and other inflammatory dermatoses for thousands of years in China. I. naturalis, a Chinese herb known as Qing Dai, is a dried pigment prepared from several plant species, including Baphicacanthus cusia. The active components include indi- rubin and tryptanthrin. Indirubin inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) activi- ties [26] and keratinocyte proliferation in vitro.132 Tryptanthrin inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)– induced angiogenesis, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and dose-dependent expressions of cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), at both mRNA and protein levels.133 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted using I. naturalis as topical monotherapy to treat moderate plaque psoriasis in 24 Chinese patients; 16 were treated with I. naturalis ointment and 8 with matched placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. At week 8, significant improvements in PASI scores from baseline were observed in I. naturalis–treated patients (56.3% had 75% improvement [PASI 75] response) compared with placebo (0.0%). A gene expression signature of moderate psoriasis was estab- lished from baseline skin biopsies and up-regulation of the IL-17 pathway was seen as a key component. After the treatment, repeat biopsy specimens showed most signature genes returning toward normal, including down-regulation of the IL-17 pathway. Using an in vitro keratinocyte assay, the IL-17-inhibitory effect was observed for tryptanthrin.134 In a small trial, 14 patients applied indigo ointment versus vehicle alone on contralateral lesions daily for 8 weeks. Significant reduction was observed in clinical scores of induration, scaling, ery- thema, and clearing. Analysis of biopsies taken at the end of treat- ment showed marked improvement of skin histology. Expression of proliferation marker Ki-67 and inflammatory marker CD3 were decreased, but the differentiation marker filaggrin was increased in the epidermis.135 Another preliminary clinical trial conducted by Dermatest (Germany) evaluated a proprietary formula containing Indigofera tinc- toria, Rheum palmatum, Portulaca oleracea, Phellodendron amurense, Angelica sinensis, Sapindus mukorossi, and Dipotassium glycyrrhizinate. After 6 weeks of treatment, there was a significant reduction of 58% in PASI, skin thickness (55%), erythema (44%), scaling (73%), and pruritus (82%) (unpublished data). See Figs. 214.4, 214.5, and 214.6.

## Scalp Psoriasis

An indigo-containing scalp lotion and an herbal shampoo containing Sapindus mukorossi fruit extract with zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid was studied for scalp psoriasis. The scalp lotion also included Rheum palmatum, Portulaca oleracea, Phellodendron amurense, Angelica poly- morpha sinensis, and Sapindus mukorossi. A reduction of 92% in the severity of lesions (Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index [PSSI]) was observed in 67% after 6 weeks of treatment. Improvement of 50% in psoriasis severity (PSSI 50) was observed in 100% of subjects (Prof. A. Lukyanov, Belarus, unpublished data). See Fig. 214.7.

## Aloe vera

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that topical applica- tion of an Aloe vera extract in a hydrophilic cream was highly effective in psoriasis vulgaris. Sixty patients with slight to moderate chronic plaque-type psoriasis and PASI scores between 4.8 and 16.7 (mean 9.3) whose mean duration of disease averaged 8.5 years (range 1–21 years) applied either the aloe or a placebo gel three times a day. The treatment was well tolerated by all the patients, with no adverse drug-related symptoms and no dropouts. By the end of the study (4–12 months of treatment), the A. vera extract cream had cured 25 of 30 patients

(83.3%) compared with the placebo cure rate of only 2 of 30 (6.6%), resulting in significant clearing of the psoriatic plaques (328 of [82.8%] vs. placebo 28 of 366 [7.7%]) and a decrease in PASI score to a mean of 2.2.136 A systematic review of this trial plus three others revealed methodological weaknesses that made it unable to reach any definitive conclusions on effectiveness.137

## Curcumin

Curcumin gel yielded 90% resolution of plaques in 50% of patients within 2 to 6 weeks; the remainder of the study subjects showed 50% to 85% improvement.138 Curcumin was found to be twice as effective as calcipotriene cream (which generally takes 3 months to exert its full effect). Curcumin acts as a selective phosphorylase kinase inhibitor, thereby reducing inflammation through the inhi- bition of NF κ B. In a randomized, intraindividual, right–left comparative, placebo- controlled, double-blind trial, 34 patients with mild to moderate pso- riasis were treated with a topical turmeric microemulgel. Clinical and quality-of-life parameters in treated lesions significantly improved compared with the untreated lesions.139

## Mahonia aquifolium

Several open and placebo-controlled trials have supported the effec- tiveness of Mahonia aquifolium topical cream in the treatment of pso- riasis. On the basis of physician and patient assessments, 71% to 81% of patients improved in these trials.140 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 200 patients also demonstrated statistically significant improvement when this agent was applied twice daily for 12 weeks.141

## Topical Vitamin D

Topical corticosteroids are the most common treatment for psori- asis; however, their long-term use is associated with a potential risk for side effects. Topical vitamin D modulators have been developed as an option for use in place of or in addition to, topical corticoste- roids. Topically, vitamin D inhibits keratinocyte proliferation, normal- izes differentiation, and modulates immune cell activity with minimal effect on serum calcium.142 Calcipotriene is the most widely used top- ical vitamin D. Although evidence suggests that it is approximately as effective as low- to medium-potency corticosteroids in the long term (response is not obtained as quickly as with corticosteroids), it is

associated with cutaneous irritation, especially when used on sensitive skin. Calcitriol ointment contains the naturally occurring active form of vitamin D 3 and is associated with a low rate of cutaneous and sys- temic adverse effects. By inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, IL-23, and TNF- α , topical nicotinamide has been shown to enhance the efficacy of calcipotriene therapy when used in combination.143

## Emollients

The scaliness of psoriasis benefits from the use of emollients. Intercellular lipids such as ceramides play an important role in regulat- ing the homeostasis of the skin water barrier and the skin’s water-hold- ing capacity, and it has been shown that ceramides are decreased in the psoriatic epidermis. Newer ceramide-containing emollients have shown benefit in psoriasis and may improve skin barrier function and decrease water loss.144


Despite the complexity of this disease, the therapeutic approach is fairly straightforward: decrease bowel toxemia, rebalance fatty acid levels and inflammatory processes systemically and in the skin, and use the listed therapeutic regimen to further balance the abnormal cell proliferation.


• Limit sugar, meat, animal fats, and alcohol. • Increase intake of dietary fiber and cold-water fish, and, if indi- cated, bring weight to normal levels with a hypocaloric diet. • Follow Mediterranean or Paleolithic diet if patient has cardiometa- bolic comorbidities. • Eliminate sources of gluten if patient is gluten-sensitive. • Identify and address any food allergies.


• High-potency multivitamin/multimineral formula • Fish oils: 3000 mg EPA+DHA • Vitamin D: 5000 to 10,000 IU/day based on serum 25(OH)D level • Consider vitamin E 400 (mixed tocopherols) IU/day, chromium 400 mcg/day, selenium 200 mcg/day, folate 1 mg/day. • Consider digestive enzymes and/or bile acids with meals. • Water-soluble fiber (psyllium, pectin, guar gum, etc.): 5 g at bedtime


Consider the following if indicated by impaired digestion or liver function: H. canadensis (goldenseal) • The dose should be based on berberine content; because there is a wide range of quality in goldenseal preparations, standardized extracts are preferred three times a day. • Dried root or as infusion (tea): 2 to 4 g three times a day • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (0.5–1 tsp) three times a day • Solid (powdered dry) extract (4:1 or 8%–12% alkaloid content): 250 to 500 mg three times a day S. sarsaparilla • Dried root or by decoction: 1 to 4 g three times a day • Liquid extract (1:1): 8 to 16 mL (2–4 tsp) three times a day • Solid extract (4:1): 250 to 500 mg three times a day S. marianum (milk thistle): • Silymarin: 70 to 210 mg three times a day

<!-- chunk -->

## Psychological Considerations

• Evaluate stress levels and use stress reduction techniques as appro- priate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Medicines

• Sunbathing—taking precautions not to become sunburned. • UVB: 295 to 305 nm, 2 mW/cm2, 3 minutes, three times a week

<!-- chunk -->

## Topical Treatment

• Indigo-based cream, A. vera, curcumin, M. aquifolium, or vitamin D. Apply to affected areas of the skin two to three times/day. • Ceramide-containing emollient two to three times a day

## 1768SECTION 6 Diseases

of circulating immune complexes is one of the major factors thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. The cell-mediated, humoral, and nonspecific immune complexes lead to much of the proliferative inflam- mation seen in RA. Genetic susceptibility, abnormal bowel permeability, lifestyle and nutritional factors, food allergies/sensitivities (including glu- ten intolerance), microorganisms, and environmental toxicants have all been investigated as triggers of this autoimmune reaction.

<!-- chunk -->

## Genetic Susceptibility

Female gender and positive family history are considered risk factors for developing RA, and studies of twins demonstrate other genetic risk factors. There is a 15% concordance rate in monozygotic twins—four times that in dizygotic twins. Genetic studies have isolated a “shared epitope” in HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 subtypes that is expressed in 80% of Caucasians with RA. HLA-DRB1 and other factors may be associ- ated with more aggressive disease by affecting antioxidant pathways and detoxification pathways that likely contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. Patients with RA also have changes in fecal flora, and studies have shown that independent of other contributing factors, the flora of monozygotic twins is more similar than that of dizygotic twins.2

<!-- chunk -->

## Environmental Factors

Toxins in cigarette smoke interact with the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles, enhancing the inflammatory process and increasing the risk of seropositive RA. The risk of smokers developing RA is nearly eightfold for carriers of the shared epitope and nearly sixteenfold for homozy- gous individuals.3 Smoking also increases RA risk in the general popu- lation, threefold for men. Quitting smoking results in a decreased risk of seropositive disease. Epidemiological studies have reported an increased prevalence of antinuclear antibodies associated with occupational exposures to per- sistent organic pollutants (POPs). POPs influence the immune system, which may increase the risk of autoimmune conditions such as RA.4 Based on a job-exposure matrix, substantial handling of organic sol- vents was associated with an increased relative risk of RA.5 Exposure to silica particles in dust activates the innate immune system, leading to activation of proinflammatory cytokine production, activation of adap- tive immunity, autoantibody production, and tissue damage. Several studies suggest an association between silicosis and RA.6 However, a large case-controlled study of pottery, sandstone, and refractory work- ers did not find a statistically significant association between respiratory silica and RA.7 Data from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study revealed that participants who self-reported residential or work- place use of pesticides were twice as likely to have been diagnosed with either RA or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA rates are 37% higher in persons living <50 m from highways than in those living 150 m away. When individual vehicular exhaust components were assessed for risk, particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM 2.5 ) showed no association, but ozone levels accounted for a 26% increase in risk. PM 2.5 levels can increase the risk of juvenile RA by 60%.8 Women in the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) trial with blood poly- chlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in the second, third, and fourth quartiles had more than twice the risk of RA as those with PCBs in the first quartile.9 Hair and blood cadmium, nickel, and lead levels are found to be significantly higher in those with RA than in healthy con- trols.10 Low socioeconomic status is associated with increased morbid- ity and mortality in RA. Factors such as poor diet, drinking more than three cups of coffee per day, and psychological factors may play a role in the development of the disease and affect the levels of pain and phys- ical disability experienced by patients with RA. Oral contraceptives, tea intake, and increased vitamin D consumption have been found to be protective. Additional environmental factors such as low temperature, high atmospheric pressure, and high humidity have been correlated with increased RA pain.

## Oxidative Stress

Oxidative stress–induced alterations in cellular signal transduction pathways play a pivotal role in the development of arthritis. Free radi- cals have both direct and indirect effects in the pathogenesis of arthritis. Indirectly, free radicals act as secondary messengers in inflammatory and immunological cellular responses, activating transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B) and activator protein 1 (AP- 1), that control genes involved in inflammation. Directly, free radicals damage hyaluronic acid and degrade the joint cartilage by attacking its proteoglycan and inhibiting its synthesis. Several studies have shown that the risk of RA is highest in people with the lowest levels of nutri- ent antioxidants. One study examined people who developed RA and SLE 2 to 15 years after they donated blood in 1974.11 For each case, four controls were selected from the serum bank donors matched for race, gender, and age. Stored serum samples from cases and controls were assayed for α -tocopherol, beta-carotene, and retinol. Patients with both diseases had lower serum concentrations of α -tocopherol, beta-carotene, and retinol in 1974 than their matched controls. Low antioxidant levels may be exacerbated by genetic factors; the shared epitope leads to increased nitrous oxide production and inhibition of antioxidative cellular pathways.12 The resulting increase in oxidative stress could produce free-radical damage of DNA and mutations that may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. Once disease is established, synovial concentrations of free radicals are elevated, and concentra- tions of antioxidants are diminished, accelerating inflammation and joint destruction. Considering the role of reactive oxygen species in cellular dys- function and inflammation, biomarkers of oxidative damage, such as 8-hydroxy-2 ′ -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), may be helpful to assess antioxidant sta- tus and toxin load. Studies have shown increased lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation markers and impaired antioxidant status, confirming the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of RA.13 Another study showed greater baseline 8-OHdG levels among subjects with RA com- pared with both healthy young (p < 0.001) and elderly (p < 0.05) sub- jects, indicating that subjects with RA have higher levels of oxidative stress than healthy individuals.

## Autoantibody Production

The serum of most individuals with RA contains rheumatoid fac- tor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) autoantibodies. Their presence is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. The serum titers often correlate well with the severity of arthritis symp- toms and prognosis, and the antibodies are not directly responsible for joint destruction. Most RF is formed locally in the affected joints by the inflammatory infiltration of activated B cells and plasma cells. Autoantibodies have been detected up to 10 years before the onset of clinical disease. Inflammatory markers, such as soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II, have been shown to be elevated for up to 12 years before diagnosis and positively correlated with RA incidence. This suggests a “multiple-hit” model in which pathogenesis progresses in distinct stages, which may explain why autoantibodies are present for years before clinical manifestations appear.

## Microbial Influences: Infection and Cross-Reactivity

Microorganisms play important roles in states of health and disease, the most obvious being frank infections that facilitate the patho- genesis of RA. Pathogenic or immunogenic microbes such as yeast,

## 1769CHAPTER 215 Rheumatoid Arthritis

gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, and amoebas can provoke an immune response that cross-reacts with human body tissues, induc- ing systemic inflammatory disease as well as tissue-specific inflamma- tion.14 The onset of RA is preceded by a specific inciting event in 8% to 15% of cases, and antimicrobials such as metronidazole, clotrimazole, acyclovir, roxithromycin, tetracycline, sulfasalazine, and minocycline have been associated with improvement in symptoms and, in some cases, complete remission. Many pathogens, such as Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, rubella virus, Mycoplasma, ame- bic organisms, E. coli, influenza AH2N2, Porphyromonas, and Proteus, have been associated with RA. Although no single microbial agent has been consistently isolated in patients with the disease, it may be that a multitude of organisms can directly or indirectly contribute to the disease process by infection, antigen persistence, circulating immune complexes, or immune cross-reactivity. In genetically susceptible indi- viduals, reactive arthritis occurs secondary to an enteric, urogenital, or respiratory infection by over a dozen different microorganisms and persists well beyond, or occurs even in the absence of, clinically evident infection. The condition becomes chronic in 15% to 60% of cases. Some organisms, such as parvovirus B19, commonly produce an RA-like arthritis and autoantibodies, including RF and antinuclear antibody (ANA), which may be positive in early infection. Although most patients clear the infection, chronic forms are known in up to 20% of cases, where viral DNA is recoverable from a variety of tissues for years postinfection. This raises the possibility that RA development could be driven by chronic infection and/or the persistence of parvovi- rus B19 antigens. Other pathogens, such as Proteus mirabilis, stimulate the production of cross-reactive antibodies, which were found to be elevated in over 90% of patients with active RA.15 These antibody lev- els were positively correlated with several markers of disease activity, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and RF. Antibodies to Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella have also been shown to cross-react with collagen, whereas antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Yersinia enterocolitica cross-react with other joint tissues. These antibodies are homologous with type XI collagen found in hyaline cartilage, and their immune complexes have been recovered in the synovia of patients with RA.

## Dysbiosis and Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth

There is more microflora in the digestive tract than human cells in the body, and the composition of the hundreds of species of microorgan- isms is known to be affected by genetics, medical treatment, diet, and stress. The flora can contribute to many diseases and have a profound influence on immune function, nutritional status, and stress response. In one study, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a member of the normal flora in mice and humans, was inoculated in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of germ-free mice.16 Monitoring the host transcriptional response to this single species, the researchers observed a breadth of influence on intestinal function, including improved nutrient absorp- tion and processing by the host, mucosal barrier fortification, influx of IgA-producing B cells, and prevention of the inflammatory response or complement-mediated mucosal damage. Also affected were xeno- biotic metabolism, neurotransmitter production, the enteric nervous system, gut motility, angiogenesis, and postnatal intestinal maturation. Many of these intestinal functions are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of RA. Fecal flora is significantly altered in RA, including signifi- cantly decreased bifidobacteria and bacteria of the Bacteroides– Porphyromonas–Prevotella group. Randomized clinical studies have demonstrated improvement with changes in microbial flora. Up to 51% of patients with RA have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),17 and the degree of SIBO is associated with the severity of symptoms and disease activity.18 SIBO has also been linked to the devel- opment of bowel-associated dermatosis-arthritis syndrome, which can present as arthralgia and swelling in multiple joints.19 The concept of multifocal dysbiosis suggests that the alteration in normal flora is not confined to the gut and cumulatively can produce the immune dysregulation typical of any autoimmune condition. The cumulative load of all microflora, most of which consists of unculti- vated and novel organisms, is difficult to predict. This concept of total pathogen burden does, however, appear to correlate with increased CRP and cardiovascular risk and may also contribute to the patho- genesis of RA. Evidence to support this concept can be found in patients with concurrent RA and periodontal disease. One study found identical periodontal bacterial DNA in 100% of synovial fluid sam- ples and 83.5% of serum samples of patients with RA,20 and another study found a correlation between the severity of periodontitis and the severity of RA symptoms.21 Antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with elevated anti-CCP antibodies and may be involved in breaking immune tolerance to citrullinated antigens and promoting the autoimmune response in RA.22

## Adverse Food Reactions

It is estimated that up to 10% of the population has food allergies. In patients who have tested positive for allergies on skin-prick test- ing, consumption of those allergenic foods is associated with increases in inflammatory markers such as TNF- α , IL-1 β , CRP, and ESR. Outcomes of food allergy studies in RA have been conflicting. Two possible explanations for negative correlations are that the allergen challenges were too small in quantity, frequency, or both and/or that serum antibody levels are not representative of the mucosal immune response in the intestine. Another confounding factor is that adverse food reactions (e.g., food intolerance, sensitivity, dietary lectins) are not antibody-mediated and therefore not apparent with antibody test- ing. Still, these reactions may be contributory. Studies using larger doses of food antigens tend to provide a pos- itive correlation between RA and food allergies in 20% to 40% of patients.23 Jejunal IgA, IgG, and IgM were significantly elevated against nearly all food antigens in patients with RA compared with controls, and the antibodies were substantially cross-reactive. The investigators concluded that patients with RA may have multiple modest hypersen- sitivity reactions and that the additive effect could lead to widespread antibody-mediated tissue destruction. Dietary salt has been shown to interfere with the regulatory mecha- nisms of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems, enhancing proinflammatory responses by inducing interferon (IFN)-gamma pro- duction and reducing the activation of IL-4 and IL-13 macrophages. A cross-sectional study demonstrated a significant dose-dependent association between total sodium intake in the fourth quartile and a diagnosis of RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1–2.1, p for trend = 0.02).24

## Xenobiotics and Autoantibody Production

Xenobiotics appear to intersect with genetics, pathogenic organisms, and other dietary and environmental factors to stimulate autoantibody production and autoimmunity. Certain xenobiotics may be particu- larly toxic to both patients with RA and people at risk for RA owing to impaired metabolism in acetylation pathways. A single genetic risk factor, the N-acetyltransferase 2 polymorphism, affects both the acetyl- ation of xenobiotics and individual susceptibility to RA. It also pre- dicts disease severity. The slow-acetylator genotype is associated with a 4.39-times-greater risk of erosive RA than fast types.25 Bacterial toxins, such as streptokinase and heat-shock proteins, can bind to mucosal tissue enzymes and stimulate autoantibody

## 1770SECTION 6 Diseases

production against peptides and tissue antigens. This same response was also stimulated by gliadin peptides, illustrating that food anti- gens can elicit responses like those caused by bacterial superantigens. Streptokinase, gliadin, casein (a milk protein), and ethyl mercury (the vaccine adjuvant in thimerosal) bind to different lymphocyte receptors and tissue antigens, producing neoantigens that can induce the pro- duction of cross-reactive autoantibodies.26

<!-- chunk -->

## Abnormal Gut Permeability

Individuals with RA have greater intestinal permeability to dietary and bacterial antigens as well as alterations in bacterial flora. Chronic inflammation in the gut can increase intestinal permeability and is associated with joint inflammation. Adverse food reactions and bac- terial endotoxins may contribute greatly to chronic gut inflammation. When exposed to gliadin, zonulin receptor-positive IEC6 and Caco2 cells release zonulin, leading to the rearrangement of the cell cytoskele- ton, loss of occluding-ZO1 protein–protein interaction, and increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules.27 Autoimmune diseases, such as RA, have been associated with elevated zonulin. At least half of the individuals with celiac disease have no GI-related symptoms but present with fatigue, subfertility, osteoporosis, joint pain, unexplained iron deficiency, and/or autoimmune disease. Reestablishing the zonu- lin-dependent intestinal barrier function may provide a mechanism by which processes such as autoimmune disease and inflammatory con- ditions may be halted in their development and possibly reversed.28 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), commonly prescribed for RA, can also exacerbate gastrointestinal inflamma- tion and intestinal permeability. However, increased gut inflam- mation and permeability also occur in RA independent of NSAID use. Increased intestinal permeability facilitates the translocation of dietary and gut-derived antigens and bacterial gut flora to blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, the spleen, and the kidneys. In conjunction with dysbiosis and bacterial overgrowth, increased gut permeability to bacterial endotoxins and food antigens can produce immune acti- vation and circulating immune complexes, many of which have been recovered in synovial fluid and could contribute to joint inflamma- tion and degeneration.

## Decreased Androgen Levels

Androgens and progesterone are natural immune suppressors and appear to be involved in the apoptosis of activated immune cells. Chronically low levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an inhibitor of NF- κ B, have been found in early-stage and established RA. One study showed positive effects of testosterone replacement therapy in male patients with RA, including decreasing RF titers, a decrease in the number of affected joints, and decreasing NSAID use.29 DHEA and testosterone may have to be modulated in concert with estrogens to be optimally effective in RA. Chronic inflam- mation and elevated TNF- α promote the conversion of testosterone to estrogen by stimulating aromatase activity, and a reduced androgen: estrogen ratio has been identified in both male and female patients with RA.

<!-- chunk -->

## Abnormal Estrogen Levels

Unlike androgens, estrogens may be involved in sustaining the inflam- matory activity of activated T cells and humoral immunity. Estradiol levels have been found to be higher in patients with RA than controls and are strongly and positively associated with indices of inflamma- tion. A 5-year study comprising 689 patients with similar disease dura- tion and severity found that gender is a major predictor of remission in early RA. Women had a lower androgen:estrogen ratio, had more severe disease, and had 16% to 22% fewer remissions than men. This effect could not be explained by any other differences between the groups, including disease duration, age, and treatments used. Considering that many environmental toxins have estrogenic effects, this may help explain the large number of environmental chemicals associated with RA.


The most commonly used criteria in the diagnosis of RA have been those issued by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1987. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria are low, espe- cially in early disease. Earlier diagnosis allows for earlier and more aggressive treatment, which may lead to better outcomes. As a result, the ACR engaged in a joint initiative with the European League Against Rheumatism to create new guidelines that classify a diagnosis of RA based on the presence of synovitis in at least one joint, with no alter- native explanation, and a score of 6 or greater in a four-tier rubric (see Table 215.1).30

## Laboratory Findings

## Rheumatoid Factor

RF is made up of a group of antibodies, usually IgM, that bind the Fc fragment of IgG. RF is formed locally in the affected joints by the inflammatory infiltration of activated B cells and plasma cells. Although it is present in 70% to 80% of patients with RA, a variety of conditions can cause elevations of RF, and 4% of apparently healthy individuals also test positive. Despite the relatively low sensitivity and specificity of the RF test, its presence is a confirmatory finding in the diagnosis of RA, and seropositivity is associated with worse outcomes.

## Anti–Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antibodies

Anti-CCP antibodies have emerged as a much more specific indicator of RA than RF as well as a better predictor of clinical course. Whereas the sensitivity of anti-CCP antibodies testing is similar to RF (70%– 80%), its specificity is greater than 95%. These autoantibodies, as well as RF, have been identified as much as 10 years before diagnosis, and their presence heralds more aggressive disease and poorer progno- sis. No single laboratory test is definitive for the diagnosis of RA, and patients may be seropositive for anti-CCP, RF, both, or neither.

The ESR and CRP are acute-phase reactants that become elevated during active inflammation. Although not specific to RA, they are use- ful in confirming the diagnosis and monitoring disease activity and response to treatment. Because patients with RA are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease,31 CRP is a useful marker of cardiovascular risk as well.

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Laboratory Abnormalities

Anemia, usually normocytic and normochromic or normocytic and hypochromic, is quite common in RA and in chronic inflamma- tory diseases. Although the serum iron level and total iron-binding capacity are usually low, supplemental iron is of no value and may promote further damage due to free radicals. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, iron stores may appear falsely elevated in RA when ESR and/or CRP are elevated. ANAs are found in 20% to 60% of patients with RA. Titers specific for native DNA are typ- ically normal, whereas titers to single-stranded or denatured DNA are usually elevated. Antinuclear antibodies may be present but at lower levels than in SLE. Joint aspiration is not necessary to diag- nose RA but may be necessary to rule out crystalline arthropathies or septic arthritis.

## Other Diagnostic Testing

It is important to keep in mind that some other conditions can mimic RA and should be ruled out before a diagnosis is made. These include vitamin D deficiency, hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, and infec- tions such as Lyme disease and hepatitis B and C. Other tests to con- sider include the following: • Hormone profiles: DHEA-S, testosterone, and estradiol • Food allergies (see Chapter 14) • Lactulose-mannitol test (see Chapter 21) • Hydrogen-methane breath test (see Chapter 9) • Stool testing for digestive function and intestinal flora (see Chapter 28) • Urine testing (see Chapter 29) • Toxicity assessment

# STANDARD MEDICAL THERAPY

Standard medical therapy is limited by its overreliance on pharma- cological therapies and focus on suppressing the disease process and its symptoms, most notably controlling the inflammation and free radicals that mediate joint damage, while failing to address the com- plex underlying causes of this disease.32 The effects and side effects of these drugs exacerbate many contributing factors to the disease pro- cess and possess significant morbidity and mortality risks of their own. Pharmacological therapies generally fall into three categories: NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biological therapies. Nonpharmacological approaches include reduction of joint stress, physical and occupational therapy, and surgery.

## Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Cyclooxy-

<!-- chunk -->

## genase Inhibitors

Usually implemented before formal diagnosis, NSAIDs are first-line anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications that suppress symp- toms while also accelerating factors that promote the disease process. NSAIDs can inhibit chondrocytes and cartilage formation and pro- mote chondrolysis and joint destruction. Furthermore, they promote several factors thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of RA by increasing hyperpermeability of the GI tract, dysbiosis, free radicals in synovial fluid, enteric inflammation, bacterial overgrowth, and bacterial translocation. NSAIDs also cause serious GI side effects, and long-term therapy has been shown to increase the risk of major GI bleeding,33 as well as a number of other adverse GI events, includ- ing heartburn/acid reflux, excess stomach acid, gastritis, abdomi- nal pain, epigastric burning, stomach ulcer, and duodenal ulcer.34 Acetaminophen alone is responsible for 50% to 60% of cases of acute liver failure in the United States,35 and according to one study, NSAIDs led to 107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths in 1 year among patients with arthritis. To mitigate this massive GI toxicity, NSAIDs are sometimes coad- ministered with acid-blocking medications. These drugs help alleviate the upper GI damage but do not protect from the ensuing iatrogenic hypochlorhydria, which is a causative factor in SIBO and another con- tributing factor to the pathogenesis of RA. Although cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have a much-improved GI safety profile compared with nonselective NSAIDs, they may not completely protect the lower GI tract from injury and are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Because patients with RA are already at increased risk for car- diovascular disease, these drugs may not be appropriate for general use in this population.36 Finally, all drugs in this class also pose the risk of renal toxicity, and chronic use of high doses in patients with arthritis increases the risk for renal failure.

## Corticosteroids

Corticosteroid medications are generally reserved for patients who do not respond to NSAID therapy. By blocking the inflammatory response, including the production and secretion of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, cor- ticosteroids suppress inflammation as well as the normal immune response. Steroid medications may be of great benefit in acute symp- tom management, but they become problematic with long-term use. Corticosteroids are associated with more frequent serious infections (i.e., those requiring hospitalization) and increased mortality. Even small doses (up to 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent) carry an increased risk for infection and death when used long term. One study found the risk of mortality increased by 14% after 1 year and 49% after more than 10 years of use compared with the status of patients with RA who had not been treated with low-dose corticosteroids.37 Common side effects of long-term corticosteroids at higher doses bring their use further into question because they exacerbate the man- ifestations of RA itself. Side effects include chondrotoxicity, osteopo- rosis, increased intestinal permeability, and cardiovascular disease, including an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the risk of peptic ulcers and GI bleeding in patients already using NSAIDs is exacerbated by corticosteroids. Insomnia is also a side effect, and patients with RA are more susceptible to insomnia than the general population. In fact, one study concluded that the fatigue experienced by patients with RA may be more due to sleep fragmentation than a constitutional symptom of the disease itself.38 Finally, depression is a common side effect of prednisone and is also common among patients experiencing chronic pain from diseases such as RA. Patients with RA

who experience depression have worse outcomes than those who are not depressed; thus, risks and benefits must be considered when rec- ommending corticosteroids.

<!-- chunk -->

## Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

Once reserved for severe cases, DMARDs are now used as first-line ther- apies according to conventional treatment guidelines. Methotrexate is the most common drug used, with the best balance of efficacy and tox- icity. Methotrexate was originally used as a chemotherapeutic agent and exerts an immunosuppressive effect by decreasing white blood cell production. The more severe side effects of methotrexate include GI ulceration; severe bone marrow suppression; frequent infections; elevated risk of cancer; and damage to the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Other drugs in this class, including hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and leflunomide, have similar, and sometimes more severe, side effects. Many patients do not con- tinue long-term therapy with any DMARD beyond the first few years because of the adverse effects or lack of efficacy. However, there is evi- dence that beginning a DMARD within the first 3 months of diagnosis is associated with a decreased risk of joint erosion. Therefore patients presenting with a diagnosis of RA will most often be on DMARDs, individually or increasingly in combination, and perhaps additional drugs to manage the side effects.

<!-- chunk -->

## Biological Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

Biological DMARDs include TNF- α antagonists such as infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab, as well as tocilizumab, an interleu- kin inhibitor, and abatacept, a drug acting on T lymphocytes. Some evidence suggests that these medications are no more effective than methotrexate when used as monotherapy.39 However, in about comparative trials analyzed, the combination of TNF- α antagonists with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone, espe- cially in initially severe RA.40 The investigators found no firm evidence that other drug combinations were more effective. Unfortunately, drug-free remission is still rarely achieved, and most patients experi- ence higher disease activity upon discontinuation of therapy. Many patients experience significant improvement within a few weeks. However, blocking TNF- α without addressing the conditions that created the imbalance leads to long-term consequences, such as sepsis and pneumonia and an increased risk of reactivating tuberculo- sis. A potent inflammatory mediator, TNF- α is also a critical part of the host defense against certain pathogens. For all patients using TNF- α inhibitors, vigilance for hypersensitivities, anemias, infections, malig- nancy, and accelerated atherosclerotic activity is required. Long-term follow-up studies do not exceed 2 years. However, the risk of severe adverse effects is likely increased with drug combinations.41


RA is a multifactorial condition that requires a comprehensive ther- apeutic approach addressing all the factors known to be involved in the inflammatory disease process. Foremost in this approach is the diet. Eliminating alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and salt; decreasing intake of animal proteins; and avoiding food allergens con- stitute a good first step.


Population studies have demonstrated that RA is less common in soci- eties that favor a more “primitive” diet and is found at higher rates in societies consuming a Western diet.42 A diet of organic whole foods, rich in vegetables and fiber and low in sugar, meat, refined carbohy- drates, saturated fat, and additives, appears to offer some protection against the development of RA as well as promise in its treatment. Some clinical evidence suggests the avoidance of foods in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family because long-term, low-level consumption of the solanum alkaloids found in tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers, and tobacco may be proinflammatory and trigger joint inflammation.

<!-- chunk -->

## Adverse Food Reactions

The elimination of reactive foods has been shown to offer significant benefit to some individuals with RA. The most common triggers in one study included corn (56%); wheat (54%); bacon/pork (39%); oranges (39%); milk and oats (37%); rye (34%); egg, beef, and coffee (32%); malt (27%); cheese and grapefruit (24%); tomato (22%); peanuts and cane sugar (20%); and butter, lamb, soy, and lemon (17%).43 Nineteen percent of participants who continued to avoid their reactive foods remained well, without medications, for follow-up periods of up to 5 years.

<!-- chunk -->

## Therapeutic Fasting

Patients with RA have historically benefited from fasting. Short-term fasts of 3 to 5 days’ duration are recommended during acute flares, which induce a substantial reduction of joint pain, swelling, morning stiffness, and other symptoms of RA. Fasting increases serum DHEA-S and decreases serum IL-6, CRP, ESR, and disease activity.44 Fasting also has a favorable effect on intestinal permeability. Juice, broth, and water fasts of longer duration, up to 10 days, have been shown to be effective, but strict water fasting should be done only under direct medical supervision. (For a full discussion, see Chapter 37.)

<!-- chunk -->

## Vegetarian Diet

One 13-month controlled study began with a 7- to 10-day fast before transitioning to a vegetarian diet.45 The fast consisted of herbal teas; garlic; vegetable broth; a decoction of potatoes and parsley; and carrot, beet, and celery juices. The diet was followed by a systematic reintro- duction of a single food item every 2 days with the elimination of foods that aggravated RA symptoms. The treatment group showed significant improvements compared with controls, and these improvements were maintained at 1-year follow-up in those patients still maintaining the diet. This study supported the positive results of short-term fasting fol- lowed by a vegetarian diet, and the pooling of these data showed statis- tically and clinically significant beneficial long-term effects. Vegetarian diets are also associated with higher fiber intake and improved gut flora, decreased antibodies to Proteus mirabilis, reduced SIBO, and an improvement in RA symptomatology. In addition, increased potas- sium intake from vegetables may lead to improved biosynthesis and release of cortisol as well as a favorable fatty acid profile and increased antioxidant intake.

## The Mediterranean Diet

Rich in seasonally fresh plant-derived foods, the Mediterranean diet is similar to the vegetarian diet, with the addition of fish and poul- try, low to moderate red meat, dairy and red wine and olive oil as the main source of lipids. Patients with established RA obtained a reduc- tion in inflammatory activity, an increase in physical function, and improved vitality after 12 weeks on a Mediterranean diet.46 Different types of dietary fats can either alleviate or aggravate RA by influenc- ing eicosanoid metabolism. Both vegetarian and Mediterranean diets are inherently low in saturated fats and arachidonic acid, the precur- sor to the inflammatory series-2 prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and α -linolenic acid (ALA), the precursors to anti-inflammatory series-1 and series-3 prostaglan- dins. The consumption of cold-water fish such as mackerel, her- ring, sardines, and salmon, which are rich in eicosapentaenoic acid

## 1773CHAPTER 215 Rheumatoid Arthritis

(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), further promotes anti- inflammatory eicosanoids. A population-based case-control study of women living in the Seattle area compared fish consumption in cases of RA with 1245 control cases.47 Consumption of broiled or baked fish was associated with a dose-dependent decreased risk of RA. This may explain some of the anti-inflammatory effects of the Mediterranean diet. By excluding meats, not only is preformed, proin- flammatory arachidonic acid removed from the diet but also a poten- tial food allergen. Several studies have found that patients with RA are commonly allergic to meats, especially beef and pork.48 Furthermore, the inclusion of olive oil produces additional benefits in RA, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, competitive inhibition of omega-6 fatty acids, pain reduction, reduced morning stiffness, and improved patient evaluation of global disease.49 These effects seem to be synergistic with fish oils.

<!-- chunk -->

## Dietary Antioxidants

The continuous production of free radicals within arthritic joints promotes joint degeneration, exhausts antioxidant systems, and may cause the low antioxidant levels commonly seen in patients with RA. The importance of consuming a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegeta- bles in the dietary treatment of RA cannot be overstated. These are the best sources of antioxidants such as vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin E, selenium, and bioflavonoids, all of which promote healthy joints by neutralizing inflammation and supporting collagen structures. Antioxidants work together synergistically, such as requiring vitamin C to regenerate vitamin E, and may explain why systematic reviews have not found single antioxidant supplements to be effective but have documented benefit for antioxidant-rich diets. The antioxidant con- tent of vegetarian and Mediterranean diets almost certainly contrib- utes to their effectiveness in treating RA. (For more information, see Chapter 97.)

## Gamma-Linolenic Acid

Evening primrose, black currant, and borage oils contain GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid that acts as a precursor to the anti-inflammatory prostaglandins of the 1-series. Although one study showed that the long-term supplementation with GLA produced a paradoxical increase in tissue arachidonic acid levels while decreasing tissue levels of EPA,50 GLA nevertheless appears to provide anti-inflammatory support in RA. GLA supplementation (1.4 g/day) has been shown to reduce the number of tender joints by 36%, the tender joint score by 45%, the swollen joint count by 28%, and the swollen joint score by 41%.51 The subjects in the study did, however, continue to take anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical drugs, which may have masked a change in arachi- donic acid and EPA levels or acted synergistically with the GLA. Review studies found statistically significant improvements in pain and global function in patients using GLA. Although the investigators emphasized the need for more trials, their conclusions in favor of GLA were stron- ger than those for fish oil.

<!-- chunk -->

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids

The richest sources of omega-3 oils are cold-water fish and flaxseed oil. The ALA in flaxseed oil must be enzymatically converted to EPA and DHA to exert an anti-inflammatory effect. Although several studies have shown that flaxseed oil is not as effective as fish oil, these studies failed to address the role of zinc (a cofactor for delta-6-desat- urase) and omega-6 fatty acids. Incorporating a low–omega-6 diet and addressing any underlying zinc deficiency while supplement- ing with 13 g (approximately 1 tbsp) of flaxseed oil a day raises tis- sue EPA levels to an extent comparable with the effects of fish oil supplementation.52 Several human and animal studies have demon- strated that flaxseed oil supplementation can inhibit the autoimmune reaction just as well as fish oil.53 Supplementing with fish oils bypasses the metabolism of ALA by directly supplying preformed EPA and DHA. Many published studies have documented the efficacy of fish oil. Because it compet- itively inhibits COX-2, which is overexpressed in the RA synovium, supplementation has been shown to decrease long-term use of NSAIDs.54 Review studies of fish oil supplementation have con- cluded that there is convincing evidence of benefit in RA, including reduced morning stiffness, fewer tender or swollen joints, decreased joint pain, less fatigue, and reduced serum markers of inflamma- tion, such as CRP, IL-1 β , TNF- α and LTB 4 .55 It may take up to weeks at a minimum daily dose of 3 g of combined EPA and DHA before effects become apparent. It is important to select a product that has been rigorously tested for contaminants such as heavy met- als, PCBs, dioxins, and lipid peroxides, or one may rely on cold-wa- ter fish and flaxseed oil for the omega-3 oils rather than fish oil capsules to help avoid these toxins. (For more information about fish oils, see Chapter 91.)

## Multivitamin/Multimineral Supplementation

A high-potency multiple-vitamin-and-mineral formula is recom- mended because bone and cartilage are dependent on a constant supply of many nutrients. Blood and/or tissue samples from patients with RA indicate that such patients are deficient in many nutrients, including magnesium, folate, vitamin B 12 , vitamin B 6 , zinc, and selenium. Many factors may contribute to deficiencies, including decreased dietary nutrient intake among patients with RA, decreased absorption due to impaired gut function, increased utilization of antioxidant nutrients resulting from elevated oxidative stress, and increased excretion of nutrients secondary to stress and medications.

<!-- chunk -->

## Selenium and Vitamin E

An important mineral cofactor for glutathione peroxidase and thi- oredoxin reductase, selenium is especially important for reducing the production of inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes and con- trolling tissue damage due to free radicals. Selenium combined with vitamin E has shown a positive effect in patients with RA. Patients already diagnosed with RA who received 600 mg vitamin E twice a day showed significant pain reduction but no changes in clinical and bio- chemical indices of inflammation.56


A cofactor for delta-6-desaturase, the rate-limiting enzyme in omega-3 fatty acid metabolism, zinc deficiency is associated with poor conver- sion of ALA from flaxseed oil to EPA and DHA. Deficiency is common in patients with RA, which may predispose them to increased inflam- mation due to impaired eicosanoid metabolism. Plasma zinc levels are inversely correlated with ESR, CRP, IL-1 β , and TNF- α .57 Zinc also has antioxidant effects and is a cofactor to the enzyme superoxide dis- mutase (copper-zinc SOD). Patients using corticosteroids may be at increased risk for zinc deficiency because these medications have been shown to decrease plasma zinc and increase urinary zinc.58 Several studies have demonstrated a slight therapeutic effect from zinc supple- mentation in RA patients.

## Manganese and Superoxide Dismutase

Manganese-containing SOD is deficient in patients with RA. The injectable form of this enzyme has been shown to be effective in the treatment of RA.59 Oral manganese supplementation has been shown to increase SOD activity.60 Although no clinical studies have been

<!-- chunk -->

## 1774SECTION 6 Diseases

conducted to determine the effectiveness of manganese in the treat- ment of RA, it appears to be indicated on the basis of the low levels seen in patients with RA as well as its biochemical functions.


An important antioxidant, vitamin C concentrations in white blood cells and plasma are significantly decreased in patients with RA. Supplementation with vitamin C increases SOD activity, reduces his- tamine levels, and provides anti-inflammatory action. Studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between plasma vitamin C levels and RA disease activity as well as between vitamin C levels and CRP.61

<!-- chunk -->

## Pantothenic Acid

Whole-blood levels of pantothenic acid have been reported to be lower in patients with RA than in normal controls and inversely correlated with disease activity. Correction of these low levels brings about some alleviation of RA symptoms. In one double-blind study, a subjective improvement of RA symptoms was noted in patients receiving 2 g/ day of calcium pantothenate.62 Patients noted improvements in the duration of morning stiffness, degree of disability, and severity of pain.

## Pyridoxine (Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 6


There is a clear relationship between low serum levels of pyridoxal 5 ′ -phosphate and inflammatory indicators of RA. Plasma vitamin B 6 lev- els are lower in patients with more disability, pain, fatigue, and swollen joints, as well as the high ESR and CRP levels associated with ongoing chronic inflammation.63 Elevated levels of homocysteine were also noted and correlated with low vitamin B 6 status in patients with RA, consistent with the increased risk of cardiovascular disease seen in these patients.

<!-- chunk -->

## Copper

In patients with RA, copper salicylate yields better results in reducing pain and inflammation than standard aspirin preparations.64 Copper is also used in copper-zinc SOD. Deficiency may result in significant susceptibility to free-radical damage as a result of decreased SOD levels. However, an excess intake of copper may be detrimen- tal because of its ability to combine with peroxides and damage joint tissues.


Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that plays a role in neuromuscular and immune function, modulation of cell growth, and reduction of inflammation. Vitamin D has been shown to increase innate immu- nity while modulating adaptive immunity, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions, including RA.65 One study identified lower vitamin D levels and a higher inci- dence of RA in northern European countries compared with southern European countries.66 In both parts of Europe, however, low 25(OH) D3 levels were significantly correlated with worse RA symptomatology. A high intake of vitamin D is associated with a decreased risk of RA. Vitamin D also plays an important role in normal calcium metab- olism. A study involving 147 women, mean age of 50.9 years, found that 13% had vitamin D levels below the threshold for vitamin D– deficiency osteomalacia.67 In the winter, 73% had serum concentra- tions below the normal range. This suggests there is a disturbance in vitamin D metabolism in RA that might play a role in RA-associated osteoporosis.

## Pancreatic Enzymes and Hydrochloric Acid

Impaired digestion from inadequate secretion of pancreatic enzymes and/or hydrochloric acid is common in patients with RA and can be a major contributor to the disease process. In addition to poor assimila- tion of ingested nutrients, poorly digested food molecules can be inap- propriately absorbed, stimulating an immune response. In one study, 80% of untreated patients with RA had reduced maximal gastric acid output.68 Half of patients with RA who had inadequate hydrochloric acid secretion also had SIBO, and restoration of gastric pH helps to resolve the overgrowth. Pancreatic enzymes may offer additional benefits when taken between meals. Specifically, the proteases in pancreatin have been shown to reduce circulating levels of immune complexes in RA and other autoimmune dis- eases. Because clinical improvements usually correspond with decreases in levels of immune complexes, proteolytic enzyme supplementation is often warranted. (For more information, see Chapter 100.)


Commensal organisms interact with Toll-like receptors in the intesti- nal mucosa to promote immune tolerance and regulatory T-cell forma- tion while blocking NF- κ B, inflammation, and allergies. These effects in patients with RA may be strain-specific. For example, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG did not show a clinical benefit.69 However, a study on Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6080, produced statistically significant improvement in pain scale compared with placebo.70 Treatment also resulted in greater improvement in patient global assessment, self-as- sessed disability, CRP, ability to walk 2 miles, and participation in daily activities. Probiotics, prebiotics, and/or antimicrobial compounds may be indicated in cases of dysbiosis and SIBO. (For more information, see Chapters 104 and 105.)


Many botanicals possess significant anti-inflammatory action and are useful in the treatment of RA. The suggestions made here represent some of the more popular and better researched of these botanical medicines.

## Curcuma longa

Curcumin, the yellow pigment of Curcuma longa (turmeric), exerts excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and has been found to be as effective as cortisone or phenylbutazone in models of acute inflammation.71 Molecular targets include transcription factors (e.g., NF- κ B, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR]- gamma), enzymes (e.g., COX-2, 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX]), and cyto- kines (e.g., TNF- α , IL-1, IL-6).72 Animals models also indicate that curcumin may enhance endogenous corticosteroid activity through increased synthesis and/or release, potentiation of receptor sites, or slowing of catabolic pathways. One double-blind clinical trial compared curcumin (1200 mg/ day) with phenylbutazone (300 mg/day) in patients with RA.73 The improvements in the duration of morning stiffness, walking time, and joint swelling were comparable in both groups. Furthermore, although phenylbutazone is associated with significant adverse effects, curcumin has not been shown to produce any side effects. It is noteworthy that curcumin also lacks any direct analgesic action. A major concern regarding curcumin is absorption. One method to enhance the absorption is by complexing the curcumin with soy phos- pholipids to produce the product Meriva. Absorption studies indicate that peak plasma levels of curcumin after administration of Meriva were fivefold higher than those after administration of regular curcumin. Studies with a nano-particle-sized form of curcumin, Theracurmin, show up to 27-times-greater absorption than regular curcumin.74

fibroblasts.75 Resveratrol may also have protective effects against matrix degradation and inflammation in chondrocytes by reversing IL-1 β – induced catabolic and inflammatory responses.76

## Bromelain

Bromelain is a mixture of enzymes found in pineapple. Since 1957, more than 200 scientific papers have appeared in the research literature documenting a wide variety of beneficial effects, including reduced inflammation in RA. Much of the effects of bromelain are due to activation of compounds that break down the inflammation-induced fibrin matrix that leads to inadequate tissue drainage and edema. Bromelain also blocks the production of kinins, compounds produced during inflammation that increase swelling and cause pain. A proteo- lytic enzyme product containing bromelain, papain (an enzyme from papaya), trypsin, and chymotrypsin (pancreatic enzymes) was shown to decrease excessive levels of transforming growth factor beta in human blood, and polymorphisms of this transforming growth factor have been linked with the progression of joint destruction in rheuma- toid arthritis.77

## Zingiber officinalis

Ginger (Z. officinalis) contains antioxidants and exerts anti-inflamma- tory effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, thrombox- anes, and leukotrienes. A preliminary clinical study was conducted with seven patients with RA in whom conventional drugs had provided only temporary or partial relief.78 All patients were treated with ginger. One patient took 50 g/day of lightly cooked ginger, and the other six took either 5 g/day of fresh ginger or 0.1 to 1 g/day of powdered ginger. Despite the differences in dose, all patients who took ginger reported a substantial improvement, including pain relief, better joint mobility, and a decrease in swelling and morning stiffness. A follow-up study evaluated 28 patients with RA (18 with osteo- arthritis and 10 with muscular discomfort) who had been taking to 4000 mg of powdered ginger for periods ranging from 3 months to 2.5 years.79 It was reported that 75% of the patients with arthritis and 100% of those with muscular discomfort experienced relief in pain or swelling and that the effects were dose dependent. Fresh ginger contains higher levels of gingerols as well as a protease that may act on inflammation much like bromelain and therefore may be more effective in the treatment of RA than dried preparations. Most studies have used 1 g of dry powdered ginger root, which is a relatively small dose compared with the daily average of 8 to 10 g consumed in India. A daily dose of 2 to 4 g of dry powdered ginger is safe and may be effective in RA. This is roughly equivalent to 20 g of fresh ginger root, or a 0.5-inch slice, and can easily be incorporated into the diet in fresh fruit and vegetable juices.

## Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F

In Chinese medicine, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, or thunder god vine, has a long history of use in RA and other autoimmune diseases. Although studies have focused almost exclusively on the root, both the folium and the radix of the plant appear to have anti-inflamma- tory, analgesic, and immunosuppressive effects that may be effective in treating RA. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients with long-standing RA in whom conventional therapy had failed, 80% of those who received a high dose (380 mg/day) of etha- nol/ethyl acetate root extract had a positive response (i.e., at least 20% improvement according to the ACR criteria).80 Forty percent of the low-dose (180 mg/day) group also responded positively, compared with none in the placebo group. Another trial demonstrated that mg/day of Tripterygium extract was more effective than sulfasalazine g twice a day.81 Side effects reported for this herb include GI upset, diarrhea, headache, hair loss, menstrual abnormalities, and hypertension. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated efficacy and decreased adverse reactions from sustained-release tablet,82 topical applications,83 and coadministration with Glycyrrhiza glabra (lico- rice) root.84 Coadministration of Tripterygium with methotrexate may improve efficacy and decrease side effects compared with methotrexate alone.85

## Valeriana officinalis

Between 54% and 70% of patients with RA report sleep disruptions. V. officinalis, or valerian, has been shown to decrease the time between going to bed and the first cycle of deep sleep compared with placebo in patients with RA.86 Valerian is a sedative and anxiolytic that sensitizes gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and may also affect the actions of serotonin and adenosine. Fatigue, commonly experienced in RA, might be a sign of undiagnosed sleep disturbance rather than a product of the disease process itself. Morning symptoms of RA are correlated with a nonrestorative sleep disorder. Inadequate sleep can lead to inflammation, as measured by increased CRP, and both CRP and sleep problems are inversely related to pain thresholds in patients with RA. Therefore using valerian to improve the quality of sleep may also improve fatigue, pain threshold, and psychological measures of quality of life.

## Exercises

Exercise can improve strength and performance while maintaining range of motion in patients with RA. Exercise decreases cardiovascular risk; RA disease activity; and systemic inflammation, as evidenced by reduced ESR. Patients with well-developed disease should begin with progressive, passive range-of-motion and isometric exercises, gradually introducing active range-of-motion and isotonic exercises as appropri- ate. One randomized, controlled, multicenter trial studied the effects of high-intensity exercise in over 300 patients with RA. Participants were given either standard physical therapy or a high-intensity exercise program for 2 years. Whereas radiographic damage of the large joints was not increased, high-intensity exercise improved functionality and mood and provided a sense of well-being.87

## Hydrotherapy

Heat is typically used to help relieve stiffness and pain, relax muscles, and increase range of motion. Moist heat (e.g., moist packs, hot baths) is more effective than dry heat (e.g., heating pad). Paraffin baths can be used if skin irritation from regular water immersion develops. Cold packs are of value during acute inflammatory flareups or after hot applications. Constitutional hydrotherapy is a classic naturopathic technique utilizing alternating hot and cold applications to the torso and back in combination with electrical stimulation. As with contrast hydrotherapy in other parts of the body, this creates an alternating vasodilation and vasoconstriction intended to improve the circulation of blood through the viscera, promote detoxification, and tone the nervous system. Rather than treating the symptomatic joints, this therapy is focused on the causative factors underlying the disease: healing impaired gut function and eliminating metabolic wastes and xenobiotic toxins.

## Psychological Aspects

Optimistic patients with RA report better psychosocial and physical func- tioning than pessimistic patients, who adopt passive coping strategies like staying in bed for many hours a day. Patients who believe they can con- trol and decrease pain by using spiritual/religious coping methods tend to

## 1776SECTION 6 Diseases

have less joint pain and negative moods and are much more likely to have higher levels of general social support. Positive support from a spouse or other family member is inversely related to depression and can signifi- cantly enhance quality of life.88 Patients who lack support or experience other challenges (e.g., histories of abuse, somatization disorders, obses- sive-compulsive disorders) often rely on their healthcare providers for these needs. A supportive and validating doctor–patient relationship is vital in diseases like RA. Counseling is often appropriate to explore com- mon themes experienced by patients with RA, such as coping with severe pain, self-esteem issues, negative feelings, reflections on the past, concen- tration on recovery from disease, and general support.


RA is often an aggressive disease that requires aggressive treatment. Foremost is the use of diet to reduce the causes and ameliorate the symptoms of RA. Symptom relief can also be attained using physi- cal medicine techniques, botanicals, and nutrients. In severe cases, NSAIDs and other drugs may be necessary, at least in the acute phase. However, the physician should encourage patients not to abandon natural measures because they may enhance the effectiveness of the drugs, allow for lower doses when drugs are necessary, and provide a foundation for healing by addressing the underlying causative factors.


The first step is a therapeutic fast or elimination diet, followed by careful reintroduction of individual foods to detect those that trigger symptoms. Although any food can cause a reaction, the most common are wheat, corn, dairy products, beef, nightshade family foods (tomato, potato, eggplant, peppers), pork, citrus, oats, rye, egg, coffee, peanuts, cane sugar, lamb, and soy. After all allergens have been isolated and eliminated, a vegetarian or Mediterranean-style diet rich in organic whole foods, vegetables, cold-water fish (e.g., mackerel, herring, sardines, salmon), olive oil, and berries and low in sugar, meat, refined carbohydrates, and animal fats is indicated.

## Counseling/Psychological Therapy

A supportive and validating doctor–patient relationship should be established. Priorities include stress management, evaluation for depression, and review of the patient’s support network. Attempts should be made to work with spouses and family members if possible.

# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Positive results from other testing may indicate DHEA, testosterone, vitamin D, and therapeutics for intestinal permeability, SIBO, dysbio- sis, and environmental toxicity.

## 1778SECTION 6 Diseases

It is important to point out that the prolonged nature and inten- sity differentiate the flushing that rosacea patients experience. Many people without rosacea experience evanescent flushing in response to embarrassment, exercise, or hot environments. However, although evanescent flushing episodes last from several seconds to few minutes, the flushing that the typical rosacea patient describes lasts longer than 10 minutes and is more red than pink, with an accompanying burn- ing or stinging sensation. The stimuli that generate flushing in rosacea patients may be acutely felt emotional stress, hot drinks, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, cold or hot weather, or hot baths or showers. However, the episodes are often without known stimuli.

<!-- chunk -->

## Etiology

The cause of rosacea is poorly understood, although numerous theo- ries have been offered. Included in the factors that have been suspected of causing acne rosacea are the following: • The mite Demodex folliculorum • Alcoholism • Menopausal flushing • Vasomotor neurosis • Seborrheic diathesis • Local infection • Food allergies • B-vitamin deficiencies • Gastrointestinal disorders Most cases of rosacea are associated with moderate to severe sebor- rhea, although sebum production is not increased in many. Vasomotor lability is prevalent, and migraine headaches are three times more com- mon in persons with rosacea than in age- and gender-matched controls. There is also emerging evidence for a role for Helicobacter pylori in rosacea. It is known that H. pylori infection increases several vasoactive substances, such as histamines, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, and var- ious cytokines. However, these vascular mediators are found only with H. pylori strains that also produce a specific cytotoxin, cytotoxin-associ- ated gene A (CagA). The presence of H. pylori capable of producing this cytotoxin may be more important in the etiology of rosacea than other strains. When the presence of CagA was assessed in 60 rosacea patients and compared with age- and gender-matched control subjects with nonulcer dyspepsia, researchers found that when infected with H. pylori, 67% of rosacea patients versus only 32% of controls had positive findings for CagA. In addition, these patients had elevated systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor- α and interleukin 8. After the eradication of H. pylori infection in the rosacea patients, symptoms disappeared in most (51 of 53), and levels of tumor necrosis factor- α and interleukin 8 normalized.5,6 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a well-known rosacea trigger. Exposure to UV radiation may cause flushing and worsening of rosacea symptoms. UV-A promotes the expression of matrix metalloprotein- ase (MMP) and causes collagen denaturation, whereas UV-B increases the production of fibroblast growth factor 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Compared with healthy controls, rosacea patients have higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which promote production of inflammatory mediators by keratinocytes and fibroblasts.7 Correlations have also been made between rosacea and alcohol and smoking. Regarding the etiology of rosacea, because many of the implicated triggers are experienced by healthy persons who never go on to develop the symptoms or signs of rosacea, it is believed that rosacea-prone individuals have an inherent sensitivity to these triggers.


One of the first recommendations to the patient with rosacea is to avoid those stimuli that tend to exacerbate the disease: exposure to extremes of heat and cold, excessive sunlight, and ingestion of hot liquids, alcohol, and spicy foods. The conventional medical treatment of rosacea is usually oral tetracycline, especially for the papular or pustular lesions, although this treatment only controls rather than eradicates the disease. Topical therapy for rosacea with antibiotics or synthetic retinoids is generally less successful than systemic antibiotic treatment. Also, although topical corticosteroids may initially improve signs and symptoms, long-term corticosteroid therapy is not advisable because it may actually lead to rosacea. The treatment of chronic skin changes and severe rhinophyma may require laser treatments and surgical intervention, respectively. The natural approach in treating rosacea is to identify and elimi- nate contributing factors if possible. Key factors to address are hypo- chlorhydria, eradication of H. pylori, elimination of food allergies, and optimal intake of B vitamins.

## Hypochlorhydria

Gastric analysis of patients with rosacea has led to the postulate that it is the result of hypochlorhydria.1 Psychological factors, such as worry, depression, and stress, often reduce gastric acidity.2 Hydrochloric acid supplementation results in a marked improvement in those patients with rosacea who have achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria.5,8 Patients with rosacea have also been shown to have diminished secretion of lipase (although bicarbonate and chymotrypsin secretion were nor- mal) and to benefit from pancreatic supplementation.6

## Helicobacter pylori

Given the high incidence of hypochlorhydria, it is not surprising that a high incidence of H. pylori overgrowth in the stomach has been found in patients with rosacea.9 In a pilot study, H. pylori was found in 46 of patients with rosacea, 38 of 88 patients with other inflammatory diseases, and 5 of 14 patients without an inflammatory disease. The researchers believed that the flushing reaction in rosacea is caused by gastrin or vaso- active intestinal peptides. They also quoted an Irish study that found that 19 of 20 patients with acne rosacea tested positive for H. pylori. Another study that evaluated histological sections of the stomach mucosa found that 84% of patients (n = 31) were H. pylori–positive.10 Interestingly, 20% of the patients who tested histologically positive also tested serologically negative for the organism. The consistency between clinical success in the treatment of rosacea with metronidazole and the abatement of H. pylori isolates and serological results after treatment provides additional evidence suggesting an etiological relationship between rosacea and H. pylori infection. However, it is also possible that H. pylori is simply associated with rosacea and is not a causative factor per se, because patients with rosacea may have rates of H. pylori infection similar to those in healthy subjects.11 Interestingly, patients with rosacea complain significantly more frequently of indigestion and use more antacids than the general population.11 Many studies have confirmed a strong association between H. pylori and rosacea, with a 2003 study showing a correlation between the severity of rosacea and the level of infection.12 A single-arm clini- cal trial demonstrated a 92% (138/150) cure rate among patients with rosacea after receiving eradication therapy for H. pylori.13

## Food Allergy

The statistically significant incidence of indigestion and migraine headaches accompanying rosacea points to food intolerance, as does the reflex flushing caused by vasodilating substances. Some of the later studies seem to support the concept of rosacea as a hypersensitivity disorder. Although these studies have focused on local factors, it is possible that food hypersensitivity plays a significant role given the known association of rosacea with dietary factors exacerbating the skin flushing.

The administration of large doses of B vitamins has been shown to be quite effective,14 with riboflavin appearing to be the key factor. For example, researchers examining B vitamins were able to infect the skin of riboflavin-deficient rats with the mite D. folliculorum, but not the skin of normal rats.15 This mite was once considered a causative factor in rosacea and may still be a factor in some patients, especially those with more granulomatous lesions. Evidence suggests that a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in follicles is triggered by D. folliculorum anti- gens, stimulating the progression of the affection to the papulopustular stage.16 Although B vitamins are important for patients with rosacea, care must be exercised because some patients’ rosacea may be aggravated by large doses of these nutrients. There is a case report of a 53-year- old woman who presented to a dermatology clinic with a 9-month history of a facial eruption resembling acne rosacea. Treatment with oral hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, terfenadine, prednisone, eryth- romycin, and tetracycline had been tried during the 9 months with- out success. Topical desoximetasone, hydrocortisone, and cosmetic elimination also yielded no benefit. A patch test showed a positive reaction to nickel. The eruption began at the time of personal stress as the patient was going through a marital separation. To help with her stress, the patient began taking 100 mg/day of pyridoxine and mg/day of vitamin B 12 . Discontinuation of the vitamins resulted in a dramatic improvement; with rechallenge, the condition reappeared. The investigators noted that inflammation and exacerbations of acne related to vitamins B 2 , B 6 , and B 12 have been reported in the European literature.17


Zinc supplementation has been shown to be helpful in acne vulgaris and may also be effective in acne rosacea. To test this hypothesis, patients with rosacea were evaluated and given a clinical score, then randomly allocated to receive either zinc (23 mg from zinc sulfate) or identical placebo capsules three times daily. After 3 months, the patients crossed over. A total of 19 patients completed the study. In the group started on zinc, the scores before therapy ranged from to 11. The mean started to decrease directly after the first month of therapy with zinc sulfate to a significantly lower level. After shifting to placebo treatment, the mean started to rise gradually in the fifth month but remained significantly lower than the levels before therapy. In the group started on placebo, the score before therapy ranged from 5 to 9. The mean remained high in the first 3 months of therapy while the patients were on placebo. After shifting to zinc sulfate, the mean started to decrease after the fourth month to significantly low levels. No significant side effects were reported apart from mild gastric upset in three (12%) patients on zinc sulfate. The authors concluded that zinc is a good option in the treatment of rosacea because it was found to be safe and effective and had no significant side effects.18

## Topical Azelaic Acid

The topical application of azelaic acid (AzA) appears to be extremely effective in papulopustular rosacea. Initially, AzA was released in a 20% cream formulation and was shown in this vehicle to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate rosacea. A 15% gel formulation of AzA vastly improved the delivery of AzA and has been shown to be superior in head-to-head studies to the 20% AzA cream. It is equally as effective as metronidazole cream or gel.19–21 In a meta-analysis of five double-blind trials involving topical azelaic acid (cream or gel) for the treatment of rosacea compared with placebo or other topical treat- ments, four of five studies demonstrated significant decreases in mean inflammatory lesion count and erythema severity after treatment with AzA compared with placebo, and AzA was found to be equal to metro- nidazole in papulopustular rosacea. However, no significant decrease in the severity of telangiectasia occurred in any treatment group.20 Overexpression of cathelicidin peptide LL-37 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of rosacea, and AzA has been found to inhibit the pathological expression of cathelicidin, as well as the hyperactive protease activity that cleaves cathelicidin into LL-37. A small, prospective, open- label, interventional study was performed to assess the effects of azelaic acid 15% gel on inflammatory lesions of papulopustular rosacea.22 AzA use was associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory lesions, and these results persisted beyond the active treatment phase.

## Kanuka Honey

A pilot study of topical medical-grade kanuka honey as a treatment for rosacea found it to be an acceptable and potentially effective treatment.23 A parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial with assessor blinding was undertaken at a hospital-based research facility to investigate the efficacy of topical 90% medical-grade kanuka honey and 10% glycerine as a treatment for rosacea.24 In this study, 138 adults with a diagnosis of rosacea were equally divided into each treatment arm. Participants were randomly allocated to receive control cream (Cetomacrogol) or kanuka honey. After 8 weeks of kanuka honey treatment, about one third of participants had a clinically significant improvement, twofold greater than that observed with the control treatment.

## Physical Modalities and Devices

Laser therapy, including vascular lasers or intense pulsed light, may help to reduce refractory background erythema and clinically signif- icant telangiectases, but it will not reduce the frequency of flushing episodes. These should be administered by an experienced and trained laser therapist, and the number of sessions and length of treatment vary for each individual.25 Thirty patients with rosacea were enrolled in a randomized, con- trolled, split-face study to evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency compared with pulsed dye laser (PDL).26 Patients were treated with radiofrequency on one side and pulsed dye laser on the other side, with each treatment consisting of three sessions at 4-week intervals and followed up until 4 weeks after the last treatment. Radiofrequency and PDL resulted in significant improvement in severity scores and erythema, and 70% of the patients receiving radiofrequency showed a clinical improvement of >50%. Although no significant difference was noted between radiofrequency and PDL treatment in erythemato- telangiectatic rosacea, radiofrequency treatment led to a significantly greater decrease in papulopustular lesion count and routine severity score in papulopustular rosacea. The effect of fractional microneedling radiofrequency (FMR) on rosacea was studied in a 12-week, prospective, randomized, split-face, clinical trial.27 Two sessions of FMR were performed on one side of the cheeks with a 4-week interval, and the other side remained untreated. The erythema index decreased by 13.6% at week 12 compared with baseline, and reduced expression of markers related to inflammation, innate immunity, and angiogenesis was observed in immunohisto- chemical staining of tissue obtained after FMR treatment.


Although the causes of rosacea have not yet been determined, sufficient information is available to treat most affected patients ade- quately. Eradication of H. pylori infection (when present) and control of hypochlorhydria and food intolerance form the basis of therapy.28 This approach is supported with supplementation of B-complex vita- mins and the avoidance of vasodilating foods.

## Epidemiology

Sarcopenia is a highly prevalent condition, and wide variations have been reported in the literature, likely due to different criteria for diagnosis3 and heterogeneity of study populations.4 Compared with a young reference population, the prevalence of sarcopenia in com- munity-dwelling individuals ranged between 13% and 24% in 60- to 70-year-olds.5 Based on data from the New Mexico Elder Health Survey, sarcopenia affects about 25% of women between age 70 and 75 years, about 40% of those over age 80 years, and between 20% and 50% of men in the same age ranges.5 Baumgartner later recognized that these estimates, based on bioelectric impedance measurements, may be biased and published revised prevalence estimates in based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements,6 ranging from 8.8% in women and 13.5% in men aged 60 to 69 years and up to 16% in women and 29% in men older than 80 years. Using similar criteria, only 10% of women had sarcopenia in a cross-sectional study of elderly community-dwelling women in the French EPIDOS study.7 The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 6% to 15% among subjects 65 years of age or older in another population-based survey in the United States.8 The findings of these studies were based on measurements of muscle mass alone; however, a growing body of research suggests that the prevalence is more accu- rately predicted when incorporating elements of strength and physical performance in addition to muscle mass.9–12 A cross-sectional study of 1100 individuals aged 60 years or older living in Brazil determined that the prevalence of sarcopenia was 16% in women and 14% in men, using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) operational definition, which incorporates muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance.13 Numerous epidemiological and clinical studies report that sarcope- nia occurs with advancing age, and the elderly are an increasing pro- portion of the general population worldwide. Age-related sarcopenia begins in approximately the fifth decade and proceeds, at a population level, at a rate of ∼ 0.8% annually.14 Sarcopenia occurs to some degree in all individuals as a consequence of aging, but it can be accelerated by a variety of factors, including inactivity, malnutrition, and chronic ill- ness. A high percentage of health care costs for seniors arises from the negative outcomes of the decline in lean muscle mass.15 The reduction in skeletal muscle mass and strength with advancing age is associated with reduced mobility and disability, hospitalization, and mortality.16 Mortality was significantly related to age, comorbidity, nutritional sta- tus, physical function disability, and frailty in a prospective observa- tional study of elderly hospitalized patients.17 Metter et al. found that sarcopenia could act as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality.18 Sarcopenia represents a significant but modifiable economic bur- den on health care services worldwide. Sarcopenia has been estimated to result in annual health care costs of approximately $18.5 billion in the United States alone,19 which represents approximately 1.5% of the total health care expenditures each year. According to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people who are 65 years or older (seniors) equaled 43.1 million in 2012, representing 15% of the U.S. population. By 2050, it is projected that there will be about 83.7 million seniors, representing almost 20% of the population,20 and healthcare expenditures for seniors in the United States are expected to increase sixfold by 2040.21 By the year 2050, the global population of older adults (those ≥ 60 y) is projected to increase from 841 million (2013) to 2 billion, or 21% of the world’s population. Moreover, the elderly population is living longer; by 2050, the number of individuals aged ≥ 80 y is expected to reach 329 million.22 Improved understanding and treatment of sarcopenia would have a dramatic effect on improv- ing the health and quality of life for the elderly, reducing the associated comorbidity and disability and stabilizing rising health care costs.

# PATHOGENESIS

## Etiology

Sarcopenia is a universal phenomenon with a complex, multifactorial etiology. Many of the potential causes vary by the age and, to some extent, the gender of the individual. Several processes and mechanisms have been identified that are likely to contribute to the development of sarcopenia, including genetic heritability,23,24 malnutrition,25–29 alterations in muscle protein turnover,30 insulin resistance and altered hormonal status,31–33 increased production of pro-inflammatory cyto- kines,34 loss of α -motor neurons,35 muscular mitochondrial dysfunc- tion,36 accelerated myonuclear apoptosis,37 and impaired satellite cell function.38,39 The number of muscle fibers begins to decline after the third decade. This development contributes to a decrease in muscle size and an increase in connective-tissue content. The changes that occur in muscle with aging can be categorized as changes in strength, structure, size, fiber type, and contractile characteristics.

## Molecular and Biochemical Basis

The aging-related decline in skeletal muscle size and function is well documented; however, it is unclear whether the decline in functional capacity associated with sarcopenia results from the loss of muscle mass and/or the qualitative impairment of muscle tissue. The number of fibers in a muscle and the size of the fibers remain relatively stable from puberty until the fifth decade, at which point a noticeable decline in muscle-fiber size and number begins.40–42 Lean muscle mass con- tributes up to 50% of total body weight in young adults but declines with age to 25% at 80 years.43 Studies have shown that young men have twice as much muscle as fat mass,44 whereas this ratio is almost reversed in older men. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated a clear decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and power beginning at approximately 35 years of age.45 Muscle mass decreases at a rate of 3% to 5% per decade after the age of 30 years, and its rate of decline accelerates further after the age of 60.46 Between the ages of 20 and years, there is approximately a 30% reduction in muscle mass45 and a decline in cross-sectional area of about 20%,47 which appears to be due to a decline in both muscle-fiber size and number.48 The reductions in fiber volume may be considerably greater than the percentage declines in cross-sectional area due to the replacement of contractile tissue by connective tissue. In a 7.8-year longitudinal study, Forbes and Reina49 reported an average loss of 0.25 kg/year of lean muscle mass among participants aged 22 to 53. After 50 years of age, approximately 1% to 2% of muscle mass is expected to be lost per year.50 Muscle strength also decreases with advancing age and to a greater degree than muscle mass.51 At the whole-muscle level, there is a reduction in force and a decrease in the number of motor units.52,53 Muscle strength is reported to decline at an annual rate of approximately 1.5% and accelerates to as much as 3% per year after age 60.54–57 This decline in muscle func- tion is particularly evident in the lower extremities. The age-associ- ated decline in isometric knee extensor strength has been estimated as being between 55% and 76%.58 Two longitudinal studies investigating age-related, sex-specific losses of skeletal muscle mass reported losses in both sexes, but the loss of fat-free mass occurred at a faster rate in men even after adjusting for free testosterone, insulin-like growth fac- tor-1 (IGF-1), physical activity, and serum albumin.59,60 Muscle atrophy associated with sarcopenia appears to result from a gradual and selective loss of muscle fibers and motor neurons, accom- panied by muscle lipid infiltration.54 Muscle histochemistry in the elderly often shows an unusual pattern of fiber-type distribution. The aging-related decline in fiber size and number affects fast-twitch type II muscle fibers to a greater extent than slow-twitch type I fibers.47,61 Sarcopenia is characterized by the atrophy of type II muscle fibers and

a reduction in muscle-fiber satellite cells with aging.62 Early cross-sec- tional studies demonstrated a shift in muscle-fiber composition, with a higher type I/type II fiber ratio with advancing age.63 Computed tomography (CT) of individual muscle shows that after age 30 years, there is a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the thigh along with decreased muscle density associated with increased intramuscular fat.64 Another study has demonstrated that skeletal muscle losses result in a decrease in the total muscle cross-sectional area of about 40% between 20 and 60 years of age, which is even higher in sedentary individuals and twice as high in men compared with women.57 The combination of a decrease in type II muscle-fiber number, area, and total force pro- duction suggests that much of the aging-related decrease in muscle strength is due to a decrease in type II muscle fibers. Some of the histopathological features of muscle in the elderly therefore include muscle-fiber atrophy (particularly type II fibers), fiber-type grouping, and replacement of muscle fibers with fat and connective tissue. Earlier observations of muscle fibers in the elderly, including visualization under an electron microscope, revealed the fol- lowing changes65–70: • Hyaline degeneration, lipofuscin pigmentation, and loss of myofi- brils • Necrosis with infiltrations of macrophage cells in degenerating fibers • Groups of very small fibers with pyknotic nuclei • Central nucleation of fibers • Hypertrophy and splitting of muscle fibers • Increased endomysial connective tissue • Disorganization of sarcomere spacing, with streaming of Z-discs • Reductions in mitochondrial size • Accumulation of reticular material from the sarcoplasmic reticu- lum and T-tubules

## Loss of Neuromuscular Function

Sarcopenia may result from a progressive loss of alpha motor neu- rons.35 It has been suggested that the progressive denervation and reinnervation of muscle fibers observed during aging71–73 may be a mechanism involved in the development of sarcopenia. Yuan et al.74 found from direct microscopic observation that the number of motor neurons in the spinal cord decreased with aging. Similarly, McNeil and colleagues found differences in the number of motor units in the tib- ialis anterior of young and older men.75 Other findings from electro- physiological studies have demonstrated substantive losses of motor units in proximal and distal muscles in both the upper and lower extremities.76–78 The loss of alpha motor neurons has been estimated on the order of 50%.79 This decline appears to begin after the seventh decade80 and affects the lower extremities, with their longer axons, more than the upper limbs.57 The reduction in the number of alpha motor neurons54,81 results in a decline in coordinated muscle action and a reduction in muscle strength. These findings, taken together with muscle morphological changes, suggest that age-associated motor-unit loss may be an important contributing factor to sarcopenia.

## Protein Metabolism

About 40% of the body’s protein is found in muscle, and skeletal mus- cle mass represents about 43% of the body’s mass in healthy adults.82 Skeletal muscle mass is primarily dictated by the balance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation, with a net increase in the rate of protein synthesis leading to muscle hypertrophy.83 The balance between protein synthesis and degradation is crucial in maintaining muscle mass, and this equilibrium may be disrupted in aging. Studies show there is a direct relationship between sarcopenia and changes in muscle metabolism. Balagopal et al.84 found that the rates of muscle protein synthesis were reduced by 30% with advanced age. Sarcopenia is thought to reflect mainly an age-related decrease in the synthesis of muscle protein rather than an excess catabolic process associated with disease or from reduced caloric intake, although some have hypoth- esized that low-grade, chronic inflammation with increased protein degradation may contribute.85–87

## Genetic Influence

The development or progression of sarcopenia may be under signif- icant genetic control. Genetic epidemiological studies suggest that between 36% and 65% of an individual’s muscle strength,88,89 57% of lower extremity performance,90 and 34% of the ability to perform the activities of daily living (ADL)91 are explained by heredity. Results from a number of studies suggest that the heritability of muscle mass and strength may be as high as 60%.92–96 Polymorphisms of key proteins in the myostatin and other pathways may act as potential mediators of sarcopenia. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), retinoblastoma (RB1), and IGF-1 were strongly related to muscle strength,97 and growth/dif- ferentiation factor 8 (GDF8), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and myogenic differentiation antigen 1 (MYOD1) were identified as positional candidate genes for lower extremity muscle strength.88 Roth et al. suggest that the ciliary neurotrophic factor gene variant (CNTF A allele) may be related to the loss of muscle power during adulthood, as indicated by findings demonstrating that homo- zygous individuals had lower quadriceps-strength values.98 A poly- morphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and actinin alpha 3 (ACTN3) genes has been shown to influence the response of quadriceps peak power to strength training in older adults.99 Polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) may be associated with muscle function due to the relationship between vitamin D and its known effects on skeletal muscle.100,101 Polymorphisms in the VDR were found to be significantly associated with fat-free mass (FFM) and sarcopenia in a cohort of 302 older men.102 Results from other studies indicate an association of an allelic variant at the VDR locus with mus- cle strength and body composition in premenopausal women103 and muscle strength in elderly nonobese women.104 All of these findings indicate that sarcopenia has a significant heritable component. There remains considerable unexplained variation in muscle mass and strength among older individuals. This may be partly explained by the observation that muscle mass and strength in later life reflect not only the rate of loss but also the peak attained earlier in life. Most inter- ventional studies to date have focused on factors modifying senescent decline rather than determinants of peak muscle mass and strength attained in early adulthood.

## Developmental Influences

Evidence for developmental influences on human muscle has come from a series of observational epidemiological studies linking small size at birth, as a marker of adverse early environmental conditions, with reduced adult muscle mass and strength.105 Several retrospec- tive cohort studies have investigated whether early life influences may determine the likelihood of developing sarcopenia in later life. In the Hertfordshire Ageing Study, lower birth weight and weight at 1 year were significantly associated with lower grip strength in 700 UK older adults; this association remained significant after allowing for adult size, suggesting that an adverse early life environment may affect the quality of muscle development.106 A study of older men participat- ing in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study showed that birth weight was significantly positively associated with FFM.107 Similar findings were observed in studies of women and men using urinary creatinine excre- tion108 and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry109 to estimate muscle mass. In a study including 2003 participants of the Helsinki Birth

## 1784SECTION 6 Diseases

Cohort, low birth weight was found to be associated with lower lean mass and reduced grip strength in adult life.110 This finding remained consistent after adjusting for adult height, adult body mass index (BMI), and physical activity. These results are in line with the find- ings of similar studies linking low birth weight with reduced adult lean body mass111–114 and reduced grip strength,115,116 which is a significant predictor of survival in elderly men.117 Lower infant growth was asso- ciated with a history of falls in men,118 whereas standing balance and chair-rise ability were positively predicted by weight gain before age in men119 independent of later body size, physical activity, or health status. The experience of famine (caloric restriction >1 year) during late childhood was associated with slower walking speed, shorter stride length, and recurrent falls in a study of 4000 community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong.120 Life-course studies suggest that early life programming has an important role in determining functional capacity in aging individuals. Although most muscle growth and fiber differentiation occur postna- tally, an initially small reserve of muscle fibers, set at birth, may predis- pose to premature decline in functional ability via the loss of muscle fiber with aging.121 The origins of sarcopenia may be found in the pre- natal and postnatal environment, and declines in skeletal muscle mass and function during older age may be related to lifestyle factors during early development.122

## Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Mitochondria are organelles that play an important role in cellular metabolism and regulating nuclear apoptosis. Mitochondrial func- tion may be affected by cumulative damage to muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) observed with aging. This may result in a reduction of the metabolic rate of the synthesis of muscle-cell protein and ATP,123 finally leading to the death of muscle fibers and the loss of muscle mass.87,124 Aging-related declines in the biogenesis of muscle-cell mitochondria125 as well as the turnover of damaged mitochondria126 have been observed. It is possible that this decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis and function may contribute to the reductions in aero- bic capacity and endurance seen in sarcopenia, although the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in sarcopenia is currently controversial.36 Some authors report that the decline in mitochondrial function with aging can be attenuated by physical activity,127 whereas others report that mitochondrial impairment is only partially reversed and that this improvement does not reach the level observed in the young.87,128,129 Mitochondria appear to play a role in contributing to age-related increases in apoptotic signaling in experimental models.130

## Accelerated Myonuclear Apoptosis

Accumulating evidence suggests that an age-related acceleration of myonuclear apoptosis may contribute to the onset and progression of sarcopenia. Several reports indicate that enhanced activation of apoptosis occurs in aged skeletal muscle and that myocyte apoptosis is a mechanism underlying sarcopenia.131 Apoptosis in skeletal mus- cle displays a unique molecular signature due to the multinucleated nature of myofibrils, and type II fibers appear to be more susceptible than type I.132 Muscle biopsies of older persons show differences asso- ciated with apoptosis compared with those of younger subjects.133 The mitochondrion is considered the main site for the integration of apop- totic signaling.134 Mitochondria can induce myocyte apoptosis via caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways,135 although the mediators involved may differ depending on age or muscle-fiber type. Caspases play an important role in mediating cell death. Many of the apoptotic signaling pathways, such as mitochondria-mediated, receptor-mediated, and sarcoplasmic reticulum–mediated pathways, converge in the caspase cascade,136 and the levels of several caspases are significantly increased with age. Accumulated mutations in muscle-tis- sue mitochondrial DNA are associated with accelerated apoptosis of myocytes, and apoptosis may provide a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the loss of muscle mass that occurs with sarcopenia.135 Aside from mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, other mechanisms may be involved. In animal studies, the death receptor–mediated pathway appears to be upregulated, triggered by tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ).137–140 Increased TNF- α signaling has been shown to induce protein breakdown in myocytes141 by activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.142

## Chronic Low-Grade Inflammation

Physiological aging is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, a condition that has been termed “inflammaging.”143 Inflammaging is characterized by elevated serum levels of the same proinflammatory cytokines as those produced in metabolic stress, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, interferon- γ (IFN- γ ), and TNF- α , as well as acute- phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP).143,144 The proin- flammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- α are also members of the adipokine family because they are produced by adipose cells as well as by skeletal muscle fibers. Aging is associated with the accumulation of adipose tissue in the subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular regions, which may contribute to an inflammatory environment.145 White adipose tissue (WAT) secretes these adipokines, as well as resistin, visfatin, and adiponectin, which have been shown to promote inflammation.146 Proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines up-reg- ulate the inflammatory response,147–149 and increased circulating lev- els are associated with a decline in muscle mass and strength.150–153 Cesari et al.154 reported that CRP and IL-6 were positively associated with total fat mass and negatively associated with lean muscle mass. In the InCHIANTI study of 871 obese community-dwelling men and women, Schrager et al.155 determined that subjects with low mus- cle strength had elevated CRP and IL-6 levels compared with those with normal strength. Chronically elevated inflammatory cytokines have been shown to lead to a predisposition to sarcopenia, perhaps through increased activation of the ubiquitin-protease pathway.151,156 Furthermore, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, are reduced with age.144,157 The low-grade, proinflammatory cytokine production that occurs with aging results in a loss of muscle mass and function.158 There is also growing evidence that chronic inflammation may influence muscle anabolic responses to nutrition and exercise. Muscle protein synthesis in older adults is inversely related to levels of inflammatory cytokines,159,160 and studies using nonsteroidal anti-in- flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation have resulted in enhanced gains in muscle mass and strength in response to resistance exercise in older adults.161 These results suggest that chronic subclin- ical inflammation may contribute to the dysfunction seen in sarcope- nia, particularly among obese individuals.

## Impaired Satellite-Cell Function

Satellite cells are the source of the new nuclear material that is required for muscle growth and hypertrophy, and if the muscle fiber is dam- aged, satellite cells become activated, divide, and fuse to replace the damaged portions. The formation of muscle fibers during embryonic development involves the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and fusion of muscle precursor cells to form postmitotic multinu- cleated myotubes. Postnatal skeletal muscle growth is accompanied by an increase in the number of myonuclei per muscle fiber162 that requires the activation of resident muscle stem cells, referred to as sat- ellite cells, which proliferate and fuse with existing muscle fibers.163 Adult skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated cells, and their size is dependent, to some extent, on the number of nuclei present within a

fiber.164 Although nuclei within fibers are capable of undergoing apop- tosis during times of disuse or injury, they are unable to replicate.164 New nuclei added to muscle fibers after periods of injury or inactivity come from satellite cells, which exist between the basal lamina and the fiber plasma membrane. After injury or exercise, satellite cells become activated, migrate to the site, proliferate, and fuse to regenerate the fiber by providing an additional source of nuclei.165 There is an age-re- lated decline in the density and regenerative capacity of muscle satellite cells,38,39 which appears to be greater in type II than in type I muscle fibers.166 These impairments in satellite-cell function can prolong the recovery of muscle from injury and are likely to contribute to the pro- gressive loss of muscle mass that occurs with sarcopenia. TNF- α interferes with satellite-cell differentiation and there- fore muscle growth and regeneration by reducing the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs).167 The MRFs are a family of muscle-specific transcription factors (MyoD, myogenin, MRF4, and myf-5) that regulate the transition of satellite cells from proliferation to differentiation.168,169 TNF- α induces the production of reactive oxy- gen species (ROS), which activates nuclear factor (NF)- κ B, increasing the expression of enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome MPD sys- tem.141 TNF- α –induced activation of NF- κ B results in a loss of MyoD mRNA170 and, via activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), breakdown of MyoD and myogenin.171,172 This suggests that part of the attenuated hypertrophic response in elderly versus young muscle173 could be due to a decrease in MRFs resulting from impaired satellite-cell differentiation.

## Myostatin as a Negative Regulator of Muscle Mass

The transition from myoblasts to myotubes is initiated by MRF expres- sion. This process is inhibited by the presence of myostatin, which has been shown to downregulate myoD. Myostatin, otherwise known as growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), is part of the transforming growth factor- β (TGF- β ) superfamily. Myostatin is produced in skel- etal muscle and acts as a negative regulator of muscle mass. This was demonstrated in mice, where knocking out the GDF-8 gene led to a two- to threefold increase in skeletal muscle mass,174 and administra- tion of myostatin resulted in substantial muscle wasting.175 Animal studies have shown that a lack of myostatin gives rise to muscle hyper- plasia and hypertrophy176 and that pharmacological silencing of myo- statin suppresses systemic inflammation and can prevent or reverse muscle atrophy.177

## Altered MicroRNA Expression

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved, small (17–22 nucleotides), noncoding posttranscriptional modulators of gene expression that are involved in a variety of biological processes,178 such as skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation,179 apoptosis,180,181 and aging.182,183 miRNAs regulate the expression of mRNA targets in a sequence-specific manner by inducing mRNA degradation or transla- tional repression.184 miRNAs appear to have multiple gene targets, and each target may be regulated by multiple miRNAs.185 Recent studies have shown that miRNAs have the ability to repress protein synthe- sis in skeletal muscle,179 and aging of skeletal muscle has been associ- ated with changes in the levels of miRNA expression.186 The effect of miRNA expression has been studied in muscle biopsy samples from old and 19 young men.187 Eighteen miRNAs were found to be differen- tially expressed in those samples from elderly subjects, with let-7b and let-7e significantly elevated. Let-7 family members repress the cell-cycle regulators involved in satellite-cell activity. The authors concluded that aging is characterized by a higher expression of let-7 family members and that miRNA-mediated regulation of these factors during aging could affect muscle-cell proliferation.187 More than 1400 human miRNAs have been identified,188 and numerous miRNAs have been identified as regulators of the age-re- lated decline in skeletal muscle mass and function.189 Eisenberg and colleagues190 described 185 miRNAs that are either up- or down- regulated in 10 major muscular disorders in humans. A number of miRNAs, enriched in striated muscle (referred to as myomiRs), have been identified, including miR-1, miR-133a, miR-206, miR-208, miR-486, and miR-499.191–194 Skeletal muscle biopsies taken from six elderly men revealed elevated levels of primary miR-1-1, miR-1- 2, miR-133a-1, and miR-133a-2 compared with biopsies taken from six younger men.195 TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a muscle-wasting inflammatory cytokine.196 Results of an miRNA array demonstrated that TWEAK inhibits the expression of several miRNAs, including miR-1, miR-133, and miR-206.197 TWEAK induces skeletal muscle atrophy through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.198 Still other miRNAs appear to regulate gene-expression patterns that modulate muscle aging, including signaling through the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, heat-shock factors (HSFs), AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), sirtuins, target of rapamycin (TOR), and mitochon- dria.199 The IIS pathway is negatively regulated by miR-1, miR-133, miR-206, miR-125b, and miR-486.178 miR-23a suppresses the trans- lation of both MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1, which directly inhibits muscle atrophy.200 Similarly, a decrease in miR-23 is associated with an increase in PGC-1 α mRNA and protein in muscle.201 miR-29 regulates myogenesis by increasing muscle-cell differentiation.202

## Oxidative Stress

Age-associated oxidative damage in muscle results in atrophy and loss of muscle fibers and muscle function. An imbalance between the generation of ROS and antioxidant defense mechanisms results in oxidative stress, which is considered to be an important contrib- uting factor to the development of degenerative diseases, particularly those mediated by inflammation.203 With aging, the oxidized proteins generated in muscle may not be completely removed. Oxidative dam- age to cell components, DNA, proteins, and lipids accumulates with age and contributes to cell degeneration and to the pathogenesis of aging-associated diseases.204 Antioxidative efficiency decreases with age, and damage from oxidative stress increases with age.205 Increased production of ROS is implicated in the damage of various macromol- ecules, immune dysfunction, and muscle damage.206 Both disuse and reloading, which accelerate the muscle loss seen in sarcopenia, have been shown to greatly increase oxidative stress in the muscles of old animals.207 Data suggest that reducing high basal levels of oxidative stress in aging could potentially attenuate the loss of skeletal muscle.208

## Altered Endocrine Function

Normal aging results in decreased circulating levels of several anabolic hormones that may contribute to the changes in muscle mass and strength seen in sarcopenia. Serum levels of testosterone and adrenal androgens decline with age in males.209 In elderly women, testoster- one levels are also decreased, particularly in postmenopausal women and in women who have undergone a hysterectomy.210 Testosterone has been reported to decrease by 1% per year from age 30,211–213 and free testosterone levels decrease approximately 3% per year between the ages of 73 and 94.214 There are epidemiological data suggesting a relationship with reduced testosterone levels and the declines in mus- cle mass and strength31 and functional status215 that occur with aging. Aging decreases the sensitivity of muscle tissue to testosterone,216 and clinical studies indicate that both the decreased level of testosterone and the insensitivity of muscle tissue to testosterone in the elderly contribute to sarcopenia.217 Age-related increases in the levels of sex

## 1786SECTION 6 Diseases

hormone–binding globulin (SHGB) result in reduced levels of free or bioavailable testosterone.218 Studies have shown that low testosterone results in lower protein synthesis and a loss of muscle mass, which sug- gests that low testosterone levels may predict sarcopenia.219 The steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) also declines with age in both females and males.220 This decline is relatively linear over time and results in a decline of about 10% per decade until age 80, when the decline becomes more rapid.221 Growth hormone (GH) is important in the growth and maintenance of muscle mass, and multiple studies have found that circulating levels of GH decrease with age. Veldhuis et al. found that GH levels in study participants decreased by approx- imately 50% between the ages of 20 and 70.222 Progressive declines in GH results in a decline in plasma IGF-1,223,224 which is associated with a loss of muscle mass but not necessarily muscle strength.225 Aging muscle is capable of synthesizing IGF-1; however, it may be less sen- sitive to IGF-1, which may result in an attenuated ability to promote satellite-cell differentiation. Animal studies have revealed decreased IGF-1/Akt signaling pathways and increased expression of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 in aged rat muscle.226 Other studies have reported that low levels of anabolic hormones are positively associated with low muscle strength227 and limited mobility in men228 and women.229

## Lack of Physical Activity

Physical activity is known to have a profound effect on muscle mass and function. Inactivity has been shown to lead to a loss of muscle mass and strength at any age, and lifelong physical exercise has been shown to preserve muscle structure and function in elderly men to a degree that is comparable to active men four decades younger.230 There is a general decline in activity with aging, which causes muscles to be less functional.231 Increases in midlife leisure activity have been shown to reduce the risk of mobility impairment in old age.232 However, it may well be that the reduced physical activity seen in the elderly is a response to sarcopenia rather than a cause of it. Reduced physical activity may follow the loss of muscle mass, which then accelerates it by removing the trophic stimulus of performing daily tasks.

## Nutritional Status

Several age-related changes influence the nutritional needs and intake of the elderly. There is a decrease in energy requirements, due partially to a decline in physical activity and also to a reduc- tion in muscle mass. The fall in muscle mass reduces the metabolic rate and reduces energy requirements by about 100 kilocalories per decade.233 In the United States, total energy intake decreases with age, by 1000 to 1200 kcal in men and by 600 to 800 kcal in women in the seventh decade. This is associated with concomitant declines in most nutrient intakes, resulting in an increased risk for macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Protein-calorie malnutrition is estimated to affect 11% to 22% of community-dwelling elderly out- patients.234 Fifty percent of older adults have a vitamin and mineral intake less than the RDA, and 10% to 30% have subnormal levels.235 Inadequate nutrient intake diminishes the immune, antioxidant defense, and acute-phase responses, which may be involved in sar- copenia pathogenesis. A number of factors may contribute to malnourishment in elderly populations, including inadequate intake (reduced appetite or diffi- culty preparing food), psychological factors (depression or demen- tia), social factors (isolation or low income), and physiological factors (reduced sense of smell or taste, drug–nutrient interactions, and reductions in nutrient absorption).236 Reduced food intake is generally accepted as the main cause of undernutrition in the geriatric popula- tion, and hospitalization is a risk factor for inadequate food intake in seniors.237

## Classifications

Several consensus definitions of sarcopenia have been proposed, each providing different cut points and methodologies for assessing mus- cle mass, strength, and physical performance. Early attempts to define sarcopenia were based on measurements of skeletal muscle mass with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in relation to body size. Baumgartner et al.5 defined sarcopenia as a reduction of 2 or more standard deviations (SDs) in the muscle mass index (MMI) below the normal mean for a young reference group measured using DXA. MMI was calculated as the appendicular FFM of the combined upper and lower limbs (appendicular skeletal muscle [ASM]) divided by body height squared (ASM/height2). With this definition, the prevalence of sarcopenia was between 43% and 53% in individuals over 80 years. Janssen et al.238 proposed a definition of sarcopenia as a skeletal muscle mass index (skeletal muscle mass [kg]/weight [kg] × 100) 1 or 2 SDs below the mean for a younger reference group. The diagnostic crite- rion was later refined using appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for height and body fat mass,51 which provided a stronger association with functional performance using the same thresholds. Since 2010, many expert panels and research groups from the United States and Europe have published definitions of sarcopenia, each recommending diagnostic criteria based on combinations of measurements of muscle mass, muscle function, and physical per- formance outcomes.5,9,12,239,240 EWGSOP developed a practical clin- ical definition using functional measures of performance (gait speed) and strength (grip) preceding a measure of skeletal muscle mass for the diagnosis of sarcopenia.10 The International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS) proposed that a diagnosis of sarcopenia is con- sistent with a gait speed of less than 1 m/sec and an objectively mea- sured low muscle mass (ASM mass relative to height2 that is ≤ 7.23 kg/m2 in men and ≤ 5.67 kg/m2 in women).11 The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) recommended a screening algo- rithm designed for subjects presenting with poor physical function that initially quantifies weakness (grip strength) followed by evalua- tion of muscle mass adequacy (DXA-determined ALM adjusted for BMI).3,241–243 Although a universally adopted definition has not yet been estab- lished, there seems to be a consensus among experts that a diagnosis of sarcopenia may be established when at least two of three criteria apply: (1) low physical performance and/or (2) low muscle strength and (3) low muscle mass. Low muscle mass is defined as the presence of a muscle mass ≥ 2 SD below the sex-specific mean using data from young subjects aged 18 to 39 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) population.238 Sarcopenia has recently been recognized as a disease entity, with the awarding of an International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code (M62.84) in September 2016.244 The EWGSOP suggests a conceptual staging for sarcopenia, reflect- ing the severity of the condition, which can help guide clinical manage- ment (Table 217.1)10: • Presarcopenia is characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle mass without a significant decline in muscle strength or physical perfor- mance. • Sarcopenia is characterized by a decrease in skeletal muscle mass accompanied by an impairment of either muscle strength or per- formance. • Severe sarcopenia is the stage identified when all three criteria of the definition (decreased muscle mass, strength, and performance) are met.

## 1787CHAPTER 217 Sarcopenia

A recent cross-sectional study investigating the influence of nutri- tional status in the diagnosis of sarcopenia identified a potential lim- itation to the sarcopenia staging suggested by the EWGSOP.245 Data collected from 339 elderly nursing home patients (mean age 84.9 y and 64.3% women) in Spain included measurements of body mass compo- sition, handgrip strength, and physical performance. Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), and sar- copenia was defined according to the EWGSOP consensus definition. The authors reported that the presence of malnutrition was statistically higher in individuals with sarcopenia compared with those without it. However, in the diagnostic algorithm proposed by the EWGSOP, muscle mass is not measured in people with normal performance (gait speed) and strength (grip); therefore a subgroup of the population staged as “presarcopenic” (with only low muscle mass) could not be detected.

## Differential Diagnosis and Comorbidities

Sarcopenia is a phenomenon that has been reported among healthy, well-nourished, physically active elderly subjects246 as well as in other syndromes associated with muscle wasting and in those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or renal failure. A debate exists whether muscle loss should be termed sarcopenia under these conditions as well. Sarcopenia is different from starvation and cachexia, which are also associated with the loss of muscle but for which the causes and therapeutic approaches are different. During starvation, protein-en- ergy deficiency results in a loss of fat and muscle,247,248 but the losses are reversible with replenishment. Cachexia results in both fat and muscle mass loss; however, it accompanies chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS.247,249 In addition, there is increasing evidence that osteoporosis and sarcopenia frequently coexist,250 and there is a close association between sarcopenia and bone loss and hip fracture, a con- dition described as osteosarcopenia.250,251 First described as a loss of muscle mass, sarcopenia has been mostly characterized using mass or strength,252 although muscle mass is believed to explain only 4% to 60% of muscle strength in older men and women.253 In 2008 Clark and Manini proposed the term dyna- penia254 to distinguish between age-associated deficits of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and muscle strength (dynapenia). Derived from the Greek for “poverty of strength” (dyna refers to “power, strength, or force,” and penia refers to “poverty”), dynapenia describes the age-re- lated loss of muscle strength and power.255 Being both obese and sarcopenic is a condition termed sarcopenic obesity,6 originally coined by Heber et al.256 Accompanying the age-re- lated loss of muscle mass is an increase of fat mass. It is reported that an average adult can expect to gain approximately 0.45 kg (1 lb) of fat and lose about 0.23 kg (0.5 lb) of muscle yearly between 30 and 60 years of age.257 This shift in body composition is often masked by stable body weight and can result in sarcopenic obesity.258,259 Clinical measures of BMI and weight are not sensitive to these shifts in body composi- tion; therefore it is more difficult to detect a person who is sarcopenic obese. This condition occurs in about 6% of the community-dwelling elderly,73 and it is estimated that approximately 30% of men and 10% of women older than 80 years have sarcopenic obesity.6,55,260 It has been hypothesized that sarcopenic obesity is associated with increased fatty infiltration of skeletal muscle, which is associated with reduced strength261,262 and functional status.263 Evidence suggests that fat infil- tration decreases motor unit recruitment and contractility,262 and the excess fatty acids in the muscle fibers appear to interfere with normal cellular signaling.264 Obesity is linked to inflammation,265,266 and in elderly subjects with increased visceral adiposity the associated chronic inflammatory state could lead to accelerated muscle loss. Roubenoff has suggested a vicious cycle explaining the role of increased fat mass in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia: loss of muscle mass results in lower physical activity that leads to obesity, which leads to an increase in cat- abolic over anabolic signals, which accelerates muscle loss.267 The sar- copenic-obese body composition phenotype has also been associated with poorer physical functioning, falls, and metabolic syndrome, and sarcopenic obesity has been reported to predict the onset of disability more than sarcopenia or obesity alone.268 Evidence reported by the Framingham and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey studies confirmed that older adults with large amounts of adipose tis- sue and low muscle mass had the highest rate of disabilities.269 Sarcopenia is assumed to be a major component in the development of frailty.270–273 Indeed, between 40% and 70% of persons who are frail are also sarcopenic.273,274 The EWGSOP consensus definition of sar- copenia,10 which includes criteria for gait speed and muscle strength, is close to and/or overlaps with a physically frail phenotype. Although frailty and sarcopenia overlap, it has been estimated that about a third of persons with sarcopenia do not have frailty, and all frail persons do not have sarcopenia.275,276 The differentiation between normal aging and frailty appears to be indistinct because some factors, such as the loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength (dynapenia), occur throughout the process of aging. To distinguish physical frailty from aging, the widely used domains include “shrinking” with weight loss and sarcopenia, weakness with low grip strength, exhaustion or poor endurance, decreased motor performance (e.g., slow walking speed, impaired balance), and decreased physical activity.277 Although there is not a universally accepted operational definition, the most commonly used definition of a physical phenotype of frailty comes from Fried and colleagues, who proposed the Fried Frailty Index (FFI) to iden- tify frailty.278 The FFI is used to assess the presence of physical frailty if three or more of the following symptoms are observed: (1) shrink- ing (unintentional weight loss), (2) weakness, (3) poor endurance or exhaustion, (4) slow walking speed, and (5) low amounts of physical activity.278 Strong associations have been observed between the physi- cal frailty phenotype and the risk of developing certain health-related outcomes.279 The difficulty in distinguishing between sarcopenia and frailty has important research and treatment implications.

## Categorizing Sarcopenia

Sarcopenia is frequently found in association with comorbidities, such as osteoporosis, obesity, or cancer.280,281 In such cases, sarcopenia may be considered as a secondary consequence of the coexisting patholog- ical condition. The EWGSOP has proposed to stratify individuals into categories of primary sarcopenia and secondary sarcopenia10 on the clinical basis that in some individuals, a clear and single cause can be identified, whereas in other cases, no evident cause can be isolated. The EWGSOP suggests defining sarcopenia as “primary” (age-related) when no other cause is evident but aging itself and as “secondary” when

## 1788SECTION 6 Diseases

one or more causes are evident (Table 217.2). Hospitalization may lead to an acute decline in muscle mass and function due to a combination of acute inflammatory burden, muscle disuse, and/or malnutrition, which may result in hospitalized individuals meeting the criteria for sarcopenia.282 “Acute sarcopenia” has been proposed to refer to the acute loss of muscle mass and function associated with hospitalization. Modern approaches to diagnosing sarcopenia are based on physical performance measures and assessment of muscle mass and strength. Muscle mass represents only one of the multiple dimensions of sar- copenia.283 A decline in mobility (resulting from improper muscle function, coordination, and/or balance) and impairment of physical function are clear manifestations of sarcopenia that significantly affect quality of life.284,285 Therefore combining assessment of muscle mass and strength with an evaluation of physical performance is an essential requirement for the identification of sarcopenia. A biomarker panel combining muscle-function performance testing, diagnostic imaging, and serum markers has been suggested to establish a clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia.286

## Assessment of Physical Performance

Standardized physical performance measures complement the objec- tive evaluation of muscle mass for the assessment of sarcopenia.51 Physical performance measures are correlated with body composition and skeletal muscle parameters262,287 and predict relevant health-re- lated outcomes such as disability, morbidity, and mortality.288–291 Walking ability appears to be the best predictor of disability, hospital- ization, and healthcare expenditure,292 and several different measures have been used, including the 400-meter walk test, 6-minute walk- ing test, and usual gait speed test. Gait speed and the Short Physical Performance Battery are brief, quantitative estimates of decline in health and clinical function in older populations.293

## Gait Speed

Gait speed measurement is the most widely used tool in clinical prac- tice for the assessment of physical performance.294–297 Gait speed is highly acceptable for subjects and health professionals in clinical set- tings because it is inexpensive, is easy to perform, and no specialist equipment is required.298 Short-distance gait speed is a reliable mea- sure associated with falls,299 hospitalizations,300 disability,290 and sur- vival301,302 in older adults. A recent systematic review determined that gait speed was a consistent risk factor for disability, cognitive impair- ment, institutionalization, falls, and/or mortality.303 A large-scale study in more than 2100 elderly subjects found that low walking speed is an independent risk factor of falls.118 In a population-based sample of 409 adults aged 60 to 96, a nonlinear relationship was determined between leg strength and gait speed that is similar for older men and women,304 indicating small changes in physiological capacity may have substantial effects on physical performance. Gait speed is frequently measured as part of other assessments, including the 6-minute and 400-meter walking tests, and the Short Physical Performance Battery includes a gait speed subtest.288,305,306 Subjects with a gait speed of <0.8 m/s are described as having poor physical performance,307,308 which is the clinically relevant threshold for gait speed chosen by several international sarcopenia working groups.10,241 Below 0.8 m/s, there is a strong association with increased risk of disability and reduced survival.309 Several studies have demon- strated that men walk faster than women even at advanced ages, sug- gesting that a single cutoff might overestimate the number of women with poor physical performance and underestimate the number of men.310,311 Recent studies in Asia also suggest that different thresholds for gait speed may be necessary for different ethnic groups.312,313

## Timed Up and Go

In the timed up and go (TUG) test, subjects are asked to rise from a standard armchair, walk to a marker 3 m away, turn, walk back, and sit down again.314 The test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility that may also be useful in following clinical change over time. Findings from a study of 60 elderly (mean age 79.5 years) patients315 found that TUG test performance correlated well with log-transformed scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = –0.81), gait speed (r = –0.61), and Bartell Index of ADL (r = –0.78). The test is quick, requires no special equipment or training, and is easily included as part of the routine medical examination.

## Balance Testing

The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a valid, efficient measure of postural balance in the geriatric population.316 A study assessed functional inde- pendence, motor performance, and balance regularly over a 9-month period in 113 elderly residents. BBS scores predicted the occurrence of multiple falls among the elderly and were strongly correlated with functional and motor performance in stroke patients.317 The BBS consists of 14 items scored on a 5-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 to 4 (0 indicates lowest level of function; 4 indi- cates highest level of function), with a maximum total score of 56. Participants presenting a score of 41 to 56 points have been described as “independent”; scores of 21 to 40 are interpreted as “walking with assistance”; and scores of 0 to 20 are generally classified as “wheel- chair bound.”317 Another study used the BBS score as a predictive model to quan- tify fall risk in community-dwelling older adults.318 An increased risk of falling was determined as a BBS score of <51 with a personal his- tory of falls or no history of falls and BBS score of <42. An individual BBS score of <40 was associated with almost 100% fall risk. Although the BBS is widely used and can distinguish fallers from nonfallers, it lacks a gait assessment component. A recent small case-control study comparing the BBS against other functional tests of mobility and bal- ance demonstrated that it had better discriminating ability than the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment score or the TUG test, with high sensitivity and specificity.319

## Stair Climb Power Test

The Stair Climb Power Test (SCPT) has been shown to be a clinically relevant measure of lower extremity power and is associated with mobility impairments. SCPT results are consistent with more complex techniques for measuring leg power and physical performance. The SCPT is suitable for clinical use; however, its use is mostly restricted to research settings due to equipment requirements.320

## Assessment of Muscle Strength

Muscle mass is a well-characterized and easily measured end point; how- ever, a better predictor of muscle function is muscle strength. In elderly men, muscle strength (the maximum capacity of a muscle to generate force) has been positively correlated with muscle fiber cross-sectional area and myonuclear and satellite-cell content.321 Muscle strength declines much more rapidly than lean muscle mass in both elderly women and men,322 and low muscle strength was strongly associated with mortality, independently of low muscle mass.323 Muscle power (the maximum rate of work undertaken by a muscle per unit time) is a strong predictor of functional mobility and risk of falling among older adults324 and may better predict functional status because it includes dynamic neuromuscular information not captured by measures of mus- cle mass or strength.325 Isokinetic dynamometry is the recognized gold standard for measuring muscle strength. As an outcome measure of sar- copenia for use in clinical practice, both muscle strength and power may be limited by the cost and availability of expensive equipment.

Decreased grip strength is a marker for sarcopenia,326 and handgrip assessment is one of the key tools for clinical assessment.327–329 Grip strength declines with age and has been reported as a predictor of physical functioning and disability.330,331 Data from three large pop- ulation-based surveys of Danes aged 45 to 102 years with a total of 8342 participants reported that grip strength declines almost linearly between 50 and 85 years of age.332 A meta-analysis of 13 studies involv- ing 44,638 participants reported a reduction in mortality risk for every 1 kg increase in grip strength.333 Isometric handgrip strength has been found to correlate with leg strength334 and also with lower extrem- ity power, knee extension torque, and calf cross-sectional muscle area.307,335 The measurement is easy to perform, is inexpensive, does not require a specialist-trained staff, and is considered a good indi- cator of overall strength.336 After multivariable adjustment, a 2.3-fold increase in the risk of falls was reported for patients in the lower third of handgrip strength compared with the upper third.337 A 25-year pro- spective cohort study of 6000 men found that handgrip strength was highly predictive of functional limitations and disability.338 Reference grip strength t-scores have been suggested as a promising method for the assessment of age-related losses of muscle strength in older adults.339 A study was performed as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Assessment for Neurological and Behavioral Assessment comparing the greatest magnitudes of grip strength between 558 young adults (aged 20 to 40 years) and 390 older adults (aged 60 to 85 years). In this study, participants with grip strength values of 1.0 or more standard deviations below the means of healthy young men and women were considered dynapenic.339 Dodds et al. combined data from 12 general population studies to produce norma- tive data for grip strength across the life course, including more than 60,000 observations of grip strength from nearly 50,000 participants.340 Their findings demonstrated that grip strength increases to a peak in early adult life and is then followed by a period of maintenance before decline with increasing age; this age-related decline begins as early as the fifth decade of life for both men and women. From a pooled sample including 26,625 participants, the FNIH Sarcopenia Project conference recommended cut points for weak- ness of grip strength of <16 kg for women and <26 kg for men.241,341 The EWGSOP defined weakness based on grip strength as <20 kg in women and <30 kg in men.10,342

## Lower Limb Strength Testing

Muscles in the lower extremities are critical for daily function and allow for close comparison to biopsy data. Further, strength loss in the lower limbs has been seen to confer the greatest risk factors for falls, injury, and disability.343 A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies344 determined that for lower extremity weakness, the combined odds ratio (OR) was 3.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01 to 2.32) for recurrent falls. In a study of 3075 women and men aged 70 to 79, Visser et al. observed that low quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) measured at baseline resulted in a 32% and 22% increased risk of mobility limitations at 2.5 years in women and men, respec- tively.345 Lower knee extensor muscle strength was also associated with an increased risk of mobility limitations in the same study. For these reasons, lower body muscle strength and function are important for the clinical assessment of sarcopenia.346 Knee extension and flexion are often used to measure lower limb power and strength, through isomet- ric, isotonic, or isokinetic actions. Isometric actions measure a mus- cle’s ability to generate force, whereas isotonic and isokinetic actions are measures of muscle power in that they involve translating a weight along an arc of motion within a given time interval. Cross-sectional studies comparing young (age 20 to 40 years) with elderly (70 to years) subjects showed declines in knee extensor torque and power ranging from 20% to 40%.347–350 A longitudinal study of 23 men (aged 73 to 86 years at baseline) reported that quadriceps muscle strength decreased 10% to 22% over the 7-year period,351 or roughly 1.4% to 3.1% per year. Studies of age-related changes in lower extremity mus- cle strength demonstrate similar results as those observed in the upper extremities. Handgrip strength was positively associated with lower extremity performance in a study of 449 community-dwelling elderly men and women.352 Cross-sectional studies have reported declines of 20% to 40% in measures such as grip strength and elbow extension torque between healthy younger subjects and elderly subjects, and lon- gitudinal studies have demonstrated yearly declines ranging from 1% to 5%.79

## Repeated Chair Stand

The repeated chair stand test is a timed (30-second) test requiring subjects to rise from a chair without using their arms and return to the seating position five times consecutively, and it has been shown to provide a reasonably reliable and valid indication of lower body strength and performance.353 Objective measures of lower extremity function among community-dwelling older adults were found to be highly predictive of subsequent disability.289 Poorer lower extremity function, as measured by repeated chair stand and 6-minute walking tests, was associated with smaller midthigh muscle area and greater intramuscular fat infiltration in older adults.262 Using baseline data of the Health, Aging and Body Composition study, performance on timed repeated chair stands was found to be independently associated with muscle strength (maximal isokinetic leg extensor torque) but not muscle mass.354

## Short Physical Performance Battery

The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a test scored to a maximum of 12 points comprising three component tasks: gait speed, standing balance, and repeated chair stands.355 These tasks combine the clinical evaluation of a subject’s muscle strength and physical per- formance and have been shown to correlate with mobility, disability, and patient outcomes, including hospitalization and mortality.308 Each component task is scored as 0 to 4 (0 = worst to 4 = best), and a com- posite score is calculated as the sum of scores on each task as 0 to 12.356 Participants presenting a score ≤ 8 points have been described as having poor physical performance.10 Meaningful changes in the SPPB have been defined,357,358 and studies have demonstrated excellent reliability and sensitivity to clinical change.359 An international working group360 has recently recommended the SPPB as a functional outcome measure

in clinical trials in older subjects. The SPPB takes about 10 minutes to complete and can easily be completed in clinical settings.355

## Assessment of Muscle Mass

Several operational methods have been proposed to quantify the rel- ative muscle mass from objective absolute values,5,238,243 providing estimates of total muscle mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM). These have led to the creation of several different skeletal muscle mass indices.10,11,312 ASM, a sum of the muscle mass of both arms and legs, is generally used when estimating the skeletal muscle mass index. Subjects with a larger body size may have larger muscle mass, indicating muscle mass is correlated with body size.361 Therefore prediction equations reflect the absolute value of ASM after adjust- ing for body size, often using height squared (ASM/ht2), body weight (ASM/wt), or BMI (ASM/BMI). Among these, the method with the highest predictive value for identifying subjects who are at higher risk for physical performance decline remains uncertain,362 and the prev- alence of sarcopenia varies considerably depending on the calculation used.51,363,364 Several techniques can be used to objectively quantify muscle mass, including anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, ultra- sound, dual-photon or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Imaging meth- ods, specifically magnetic resonance and computed tomography, are considered to be the most accurate approaches for the in vivo quantifi- cation of body composition.365 High cost, limited access to equipment, and radiation concerns limit the use of these imaging methods in rou- tine clinical practice.366

## Anthropometry

Anthropometry estimates body composition through measurement at various circumference and skin-fold sites. Skin varies in thickness from 0.5 to 2 mm367; thus fat beneath this skin typically represents most of the skin-fold measurement. The assumption is that a direct relationship exists between total body fat and subcutaneous fat. Five sites commonly used for measuring skin-fold thickness are the triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, abdomen, and thigh. Measurements from multiple (at least three) sites are deemed better for overall skin-fold assessment than measurements from only one or two sites,368 and mea- surements should be repeated at least two or three times and averaged. Several population-specific equations for calculating total body fat from skin-fold sites have been established. Although inexpensive and relatively easy to perform, anthropometric measurement offers lim- ited accuracy due to measurement error and bias associated with the site of the measurement.369 Circumference or girth measurements may also be used. Typical sites of measurement include the abdomen, but- tocks, thigh, and upper arm. As with skin-fold measurements, age- and gender-specific equations using circumferences have been developed. Reproducibility of circumference measurements is good, with only a 2% error in measurement.370 Anthropometric measures may predict disability and mortality in elderly populations. The calf circumference measurement predicted self-reported disability in a population of elderly women.7 Campbell et al.371 reported that low arm muscle area and triceps skin-fold thick- ness were associated with significantly increased mortality risk in subjects who were more than 70 years old. Body composition changes throughout the adult life span, which must be considered when eval- uating anthropometric indices.372 Height declines, and there is less FFM in an elderly person than in a younger one of the same gender.373 Most of the loss in FFM results from a decrease in skeletal muscle.259 Geriatric-specific anthropometric and bioimpedance body prediction equations have been developed.374,375

## Bioelectrical Impedance

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), also called bioelectrical imped- ance (BEI), is a commonly used technique for estimating body com- position. Based on a two-compartment body composition model (fat mass and FFM), BIA determines the resistance (impedance) to small electrical currents as they pass through the body’s water pool.365 BIA measures changes in electrical conductivity via electrodes placed on the extremities, and the lowest resistance values are used to estimate total body water (TBW), from which total body FFM is calculated. Single-frequency BIA (SF-BIA) is the most commonly used, although this technique is limited in its ability to distinguish between intracel- lular and extracellular water and may be affected by hydration status or electrolyte imbalances. A recent consensus paper by the Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders12 has discouraged the use of SF-BIA for the assessment of sarcopenia. Bioimpedance spectros- copy (BIS) or multifrequency BIA (MF-BIA) both allow for the differ- entiation of TBW into intra- and extracellular compartments376 and provide information on fat mass and are therefore more useful in eval- uating skeletal muscle.377 BIA is a safe, noninvasive, and rapid means of assessing body composition; however, its validity is influenced by sex, age, and disease state.378 The associated equipment is fairly porta- ble and easy to operate, although relatively expensive. MF-BIA appears to provide results that are comparable with other methods of body composition analysis.

## Ultrasound

Diagnostic ultrasound (US) is accepted as a clinical and research tool for evaluating skeletal muscle mass and quality. US is noninvasive and provides images of tissue configuration or changes in tissue densities,379 such as increased intramuscular fibrous and adipose tissue.380 Healthy muscle is echolucent381; as subjects age, skeletal muscles increasingly have adipose tissue infiltration and fibrosis that result in new sound reflection planes, which can be quantified.382 Ultrasound elastography (EUS) can provide information about the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle beyond muscle shape or size.383,384 Several groups have used US to estimate regional and total skeletal muscle mass, which were found to correlate well with DXA385 and magnetic resonance386 crite- ria. Echo intensity has shown a significant negative correlation with muscle strength in a recent study of elderly subjects.387 US scanning is a relatively simple and inexpensive technique. Evidence suggests that US is reproducible and accurate,388 and the technique can provide high test–retest reliability of muscle thickness and cross-sectional area.389 Its portability makes it useful for mobility-impaired patients; however, results are highly dependent on operator proficiency.

## Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry

DXA is an imaging technique that can distinguish fat, bone mineral, and lean tissues, permitting assessment of whole-body and regional body composition analysis. DXA measures skeletal muscle mass at a molecular level based on differential tissue attenuation of x-ray pho- tons.390 This whole-body scan exposes the patient to minimal radia- tion and is therefore a preferable alternative to computed tomography and magnetic resonance for research and clinical use. DXA exposes the subject to a collimated beam of x-rays to determine bone mineral and soft tissue (adipose and muscle) composition.391 DXA was shown to be superior to anthropometric measurements in evaluating limb muscle mass in elderly subjects.392 The equipment used is not portable, which is a limitation, particularly for use in large-scale epidemiological stud- ies.366 Evaluation of muscle mass using DXA (ALM adjusted for BMI) is an accepted component of the algorithms recommended by inter- national working groups to confirm a diagnosis of sarcopenia.3,10,241 Recent data suggest that the calculation of the percentage of skeletal

muscle mass (total muscle mass/weight × 100) provides a higher esti- mate of sarcopenia prevalence and is more associated with obesity sta- tus in comparison with appendicular lean muscle mass.393

<!-- chunk -->

## Computed Tomography

CT is a gold-standard imaging method for body composition analysis at the tissue-organ level.394 CT imaging is commonly used to assess the amount of adipose and skeletal muscle tissue and is a valid, precise, and accurate method to evaluate body composition.395,396 CT exposes a subject to a collimated beam of x-rays that are attenuated as they pass through the body. These attenuations relate to differences in the physical density of the tissues examined, depicted quantitatively as the CT number.397 There is a linear relationship between tissue density and CT number, reported in Hounsfield units (HU). Water is inter- nationally defined as 0 HU and air as –1000 HU; skeletal muscle has positive HU values, and adipose tissue has negative HU values. The segmented CT scan provides measures of skeletal muscle area, and multiple images at specified intervals can be used to derive regional or total volumes.398 Total muscle area and fat-free skeletal muscle volume can be calculated from these cross-sectional images.399 Sarcopenia is often characterized by fat infiltration into muscle, which affects muscle quality and force generation, particularly of the lower extremities.400 This intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) can be quantified by CT, providing a measure of functional changes in skeletal muscle.401 The use of CT can provide measurements of changes in tissue composition. In a study of institutionalized frail elderly subjects, Fiatarone et al.402 found a significant increase in midthigh muscle area (9%) in response to 8 weeks of resistance training, without changes in subcutaneous or intramuscular adipose tissue. CT offers high image contrast and clear separation of fat from other soft tissues. Advantages include high-qual- ity image reconstruction that provides a measure of tissue composition and quality. The size of the patient may represent a limitation because morbidly obese subjects may not fit in the CT scan field of view. The radiation exposure of CT and relatively high cost limit current applica- tions mainly to research settings.

## Magnetic Resonance

MR imaging is used to measure organ size and structure, body fat and fat distribution (subcutaneous, visceral and intraabdominal), and muscle size as well as body water contents. MR imaging can quan- tify the distribution of adipose tissue into visceral, subcutaneous, and intermuscular deposits.400 The technique is noninvasive and safe; how- ever, limitations include high costs, inability to scan claustrophobic persons, and difficulty fitting large subjects (BMI > 40 kg/m2) within the field of view. Conventional MR imaging cannot determine lipids or water in skeletal muscle; however, chemical shift imaging techniques, including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), have been developed that separate water and fat signals.365 1H-MRS is capa- ble of quantifying the lipid content in muscle and has been used to compare intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) changes during exercise ther- apy in adults403 and has been used to report on age-related changes in IMCL.404 Quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) provides a sim- ple, fast, and noninvasive method for measuring body composition. QMR uses the differences in the nuclear magnetic resonance prop- erties of hydrogen atoms in organic and nonorganic substances to fractionate signals originating from fat, lean tissue, and free water.405 An initial study406 in humans reported that QMR underestimated fat mass and overestimated lean mass, suggesting limitations in accuracy and specificity using QMR in the measurement of body composition. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not rely on ionizing radia- tion; therefore it is safe across age ranges and groups and allows for serial assessments.396

## Laboratory Measures of Muscle Mass

## Urinary Indicators of Muscle Mass/Degradation

Urinary creatinine excretion is used to assess muscle mass because cre- atinine is the degradation product of creatine, which constitutes a fairly standard proportion of muscle (approximately 0.3%–0.5% of muscle mass by weight). Urinary creatinine excretion reflects about 1.7% of the total creatine pool per day and is expressed per 24 hours as a coef- ficient based on height or weight. Urinary creatine is not always an accurate indicator of muscle mass, due to variation in muscle creatine content. An evolving alternative to urinary creatinine is D3-creatine, which provides estimates of total muscle mass that correlate well with MRI measurements.407 Based on the dilution of an oral dose of creat- inine-(methyl-d[3]), urinary D3-creatine has been tested in humans, has a very high bioavailability and steady state after 24 to 48 hours,408 and has the potential to be superior to DXA. Urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) has also been used as an indicator of muscle catabolism.409 The amino acid histidine is found in high concentrations as 3-MH in the muscle protein actin, and its urinary excretion can be measured as an indicator of muscle break- down. During muscle catabolism, released 3-MH is neither reused for protein synthesis nor metabolized oxidatively but, instead, is quanti- tatively excreted in the urine.409 Studies have shown that endogenous 3-MH was significantly correlated with urinary creatinine excretion410 and FFM.411 Urinary 3-MH excretion may not be a reliable marker of muscle protein catabolism, however, because actin is present in other tissues, including intestines and platelets, and may therefore also represent an index of protein breakdown in nonmuscle tissues in the body.397 A further limitation of both urinary 3-MH and creatinine as markers of skeletal muscle mass is the requirement for dietary (pro- tein) control and 24-hour urine collections.

## Serum Biomarkers

Several serum-based biological markers for sarcopenia have been pro- posed.412 Many of these are typically related to specific cellular pro- cesses413 and, although providing valuable information on sarcopenia pathophysiology, may provide limited clinical applicability.414 A range of pathogenic processes is believed to contribute to the development and progression of sarcopenia. This has limited the identification of biological markers, which describe only single aspects of the condition and appear to be only weakly associated with clinically relevant out- comes.415 Regardless, considerable research efforts have explored the identification and validation of candidate technologies and biomarkers for sarcopenia,416 which may serve as useful parameters in monitor- ing pathological skeletal muscle changes. Candidate biomarkers for sarcopenia may be distinguished in four major classes: (1) anteced- ent biomarkers to estimate risk of developing the condition, (2) diag- nostic biomarkers to detect clinically manifest sarcopenia, (3) staging biomarkers to describe categories or severity, and (4) prognostic bio- markers to predict the risk of developing adverse health outcomes.417 Proposed circulating biomarkers for sarcopenia include hormones, stress proteins and those related to the inflammatory response, antiox- idants, and products of oxidative damage.418,419 In addition, Marzetti et al. recently reported a relationship between telomere length and muscle mass.420 Telomeres from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were shorter in elderly subjects with sarcopenia relative to nonsarco- penic individuals, suggesting an association between telomere erosion and age-related muscle atrophy.

proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6.422 Evidence exists to sug- gest that increased IL-6 causes a reduction of physical performance in the elderly through its effect on muscle function. IL-6 has been associ- ated with muscle atrophy423 and mobility limitations.424 IL-6, through its interaction with IGF-1, was found to be a significant predictor of handgrip strength, muscle power, and disability in a population-based sample of 526 subjects.152

## Procollagen Type III N-Terminal Peptide

Plasma concentrations of procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (P3NP) may serve as a biomarker for muscle mass and muscle anabolic therapy.425 P3NP is a fragment released by the cleavage of procollagen type III to generate collagen III, and its levels have been associated with changes in lean mass during testosterone and GH treatment426 or resis- tance training427 in older adults. Studies measuring serum or plasma P3NP and collagen III gene expression in muscle have demonstrated increased levels of P3NP or procollagen III mRNA after resistance exercise428,429 and treatment with GH.430,431 Testosterone adminis- tration increases expression of the collagen type III gene that encodes P3NP,432 which was found to be elevated in a dose-dependent man- ner in plasma,425 suggesting P3NP may be a biomarker candidate for skeletal muscle anabolism. As skeletal muscle protein remodels, the collagenous perimysium and endomysium surrounding muscle fibers must also remodel, which would ultimately result in P3NP release and appearance in the circulation, providing further rationale for P3NP as an early biomarker for muscle anabolism.

## C-Terminal Agrin Fragment (CAF)

Several studies suggest a role for the circulating CAF as a marker for skeletal muscle mass and function.427,433 Agrin is a protein of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where it is involved in clustering of acetylcholine receptors and stabilization of presynaptic struc- tures.434 Its activity is regulated by neurotrypsin, which cleaves agrin into CAF that can be detected in human serum.435,436 Increased cir- culating CAF concentrations are related to disruption of the NMJ,437 which has been associated with muscle fiber denervation, atrophy, and dysfunction.438 Age-related degeneration of the NMJ may be associated with the development of sarcopenia.35,439 In a study of 22 healthy older subjects, serum CAF concentration was inversely related to the onset of neuromuscular fatigue in men, independent of age and BMI.440 Another study found that vitamin D supplemen- tation and strength training significantly reduced the CAF concen- trations of 69 community-dwelling older adults.437 A multicenter, nonrandomized clinical study demonstrated that CAF was signifi- cantly elevated in 73 subjects diagnosed with sarcopenia compared with matched controls, suggesting agrin-dependent sarcopenia shows a clear neurogenic component and may be distinguishable from natural muscle aging.433

## Indirect Measures of Muscle Mass/Damage

## Stress Proteins

A number of studies suggest that heat-shock proteins (HSPs) may be potential biomarkers for sarcopenia. HSPs are a family of cytoprotec- tive proteins that maintain normal cellular function by interacting with denatured or misfolded proteins, preventing their aggregation into larger complexes.441 HSP synthesis is triggered by diverse stresses, including elevated temperatures, toxin exposure, ischemia, and hypoxia.442 Age- induced alterations in filament structure and contractile elements are associated with increased levels of denatured muscle proteins.443 HSPs function to maintain cellular integrity in skeletal muscle by repairing damaged proteins or degrading irreversibly damaged ones.444 The pro- duction of extracellular HSPs has been linked with inflammation445 and apoptosis of motor neurons.446 An age-related increase in HSP expres- sion in human skeletal muscle has been reported.447 It has been proposed that this upregulation may represent an auto-protective mechanism of damaged muscle fibers448 related to the structural and metabolic alter- ations associated with sarcopenia.449 A review by Liu et al.450 determined that HSP70 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing apoptosis, facilitating muscle adaptation, and helping stabi- lize metabolic pathways. A diminished HSP70 response in aged muscle is associated with age-related functional deficits.451 Thalacker-Mercer and colleagues reported increased expression of HSP70 in aged versus young human muscle after unaccustomed high-intensity resistance loading.452 In another study of 665 elderly subjects, higher plasma HSP- 72 was found to be associated with lower muscle mass, weaker grip strength, and slower walking speed.453

## Oxidative Stress

Sarcopenia has been associated with oxidative damage. Biomarkers of oxidative stress may reflect an increased production of ROS or a decrease in antioxidant capacity. ROS accumulation during aging results in oxidative stress that can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA.454 Increased production of ROS results in increased lipid peroxidation or increased protein oxida- tion.455 Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) are indi- cators of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, and they increase with age.456 The increase in TBARS during exercise is accompa- nied by reduced HSP production, suggesting that oxidative stress during exercise may result from insufficient production of HSPs.457 Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is an independent pre- dictor of incident mobility limitation.458 Accumulation of oxidized proteins in muscle is thought to result in cellular damage or tissue dysfunction,459 decreased satellite-cell activation/proliferation, and decreased excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.460 Accumulation of carbonyl groups on protein side chains occurs as a result of oxidation, and this is considered a biochemical marker of oxidative stress.461 Protein carbonyls have been associated with lower grip strength462 and decreased walking speed463 in older adults. Similarly, elevated serum advanced glycation end products have been associated with poor grip strength in community-dwell- ing older women.464 Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) comprises the entire pool of antioxidants within a cell and includes antioxidants (glutathione [GSH]; ascorbic acid; coenzyme-Q; tocopherols; carot- enoids; and the amino acids cysteine, methionine, and tyrosine), enzymes (glutathione peroxidase [GPX], catalase, and superoxide dismutase [SOD]), and metal chelates.465 TAC is age and sex depen- dent.466 Intake of carotenoids and vitamin C and plasma levels of α - and γ -tocopherols are inversely associated with sarcopenia among older community-dwelling women.467

## Myostatin

Myostatin, also known as growth/differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8), is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- β ) superfamily and is secreted mainly by skeletal muscle fibers.468 Myostatin has been shown to be an inhibitor of muscle growth.469 Through GDF-8 gene targeting, myostatin knockout mice were shown to have an increase in skeletal muscle mass.174 Adult myostatin-deficient mice had greater maximum isometric force production compared with their wild- type counterparts,470,471 and antagonism of myostatin significantly enhanced muscle tissue regeneration in aged mice by increasing sat- ellite-cell proliferation.472 Although a mutation in the myostatin gene has been shown to result in muscle hypertrophy in humans,473 sys- temic administration of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound muscle loss.175 High muscular myostatin mRNA has been

## 1793CHAPTER 217 Sarcopenia

associated with impaired metabolism, systemic inflammation, obesity, and poor physical fitness in healthy subjects.474 Myostatin is a candi- date biomarker for skeletal muscle atrophy because it directly mediates catabolic signaling and is found in plasma.475 Activin A, which binds to the same surface receptor complex as myostatin, also stimulates mus- cle wasting.476 Both myostatin and activin A share follistatin as their antagonist.477 Because myostatin, activin A, and follistatin are sensitive to age- and disease-associated muscle changes, they may be involved in sarcopenia pathogenesis.478


Vitamin D plays an important role in skeletal muscle metabolism, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels have been found to decrease longitudinally with aging.479 Vitamin D deficiency induces proximal muscle atrophy, loss of type II muscle fibers, and down- regulation of myogenic markers and transcription factors related to muscle hypertrophy.480,481 Several cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that vitamin D levels are inversely correlated with vari- ous parameters of muscle mass and function. Persons with low serum 25(OH)D level were shown to have decreased muscle mass measured with DXA and diminished grip strength.29,482 Serum 25(OH)D was found to be positively correlated with SPPB, gait speed, 6-minute walking distance, and grip strength483 and inversely associated with poor balance and an increased risk of falls.484 Low serum 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline were independently associ- ated with the incidence of sarcopenia over a 5-year follow up in elderly (>70 years) men participating in the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project,485 and a strong inverse association between 25(OD)D level and sarcopenia was found in a cohort of 3169 adults in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV).486 A prospective cohort study with 1231 partici- pants demonstrated that 25(OH) vitamin D 3 levels lower than 10 ng/ mL were independently associated with an increased risk of falling in older adults.487 Studies show that in obese individuals, serum lev- els of cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, and 25(OH)D are lower than in nonobese individuals.488,489 A cross-sectional study of 302 nursing home residents revealed that 32% of participants had serum 25(OH) D levels below 30 ng/mL.490 Similarly, 49.4% of long-term care facil- ity residents were found to have vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL, despite receiving vitamin D supplementation (400 to 800 IU/day).491 Vitamin D insufficiency was found in 72.2% of subjects in a recent study,492 which also demonstrated that the serum 25(OH)D level was inversely correlated with body weight and BMI, and waist circumference was positively correlated with leptin and negatively correlated with adi- ponectin. Of United States and European community-dwelling older adults, 40% to 100% show vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25[OH]D levels <30 ng/mL or <75 nmol/L), and it is estimated that more than 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency.493

## Rapid Screening SARC-F

A rapid screening test for sarcopenia has been developed,494,495 based on cardinal features or consequences of sarcopenia. SARC-F is a five-question scale designed to detect muscle dysfunction in older people (Table 217.3) and includes five components: strength, need for assistance in walking, ability to rise from a chair and climb stairs, and frequency of falls. Scores range from 0 to 10 (0 = best to 10 = worst) and are dichotomized to represent healthy (0 to 3) versus symptomatic (4+) status. SARC-F has been proven internally consis- tent and valid for detecting persons at risk for adverse outcomes from sarcopenia,496 is able to predict physical limitation,497 and can be used successfully to screen for sarcopenia.273 Cao et al. showed that a low SARC-F score was associated with poor physical performance, poor grip strength, and hospitalization.498 SARC-F appears to be a brief, inexpensive, reliable clinical tool that may be useful in screen- ing for sarcopenia, similar to the FRAX questionnaire for osteopo- rotic fracture risk assessment.499,500

## Assessment of Nutritional Status

Malnutrition is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of sar- copenia. An assessment of nutritional status in elderly patients pre- senting with strength or performance deficits may be helpful. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) is widely used to screen elderly patients for malnutrition501 and incorporates BMI and anthropo- metric measurements.502 Initially developed for the frail elderly, the MNA has been validated for use in other elderly populations.503 The MNA consists of 18 questions relating to anthropometrics (weight loss, BMI, circumference measurements), dietary intake (change in appetite, number meals/day, autonomy of feeding), global assess- ment (mobility, lifestyle, medication use), and subjective assessment (self-perception of health and nutritional status), with a maximum score of 30 points.504,505 Patients who score >24 points are consid- ered well nourished, those scoring 17 to 23.5 points are classified as being at risk of malnutrition, and those scoring <17 points may have existing malnutrition. The MNA is a validated assessment instru- ment for nutritional problems506; however, its length limits its use- fulness for screening. The Mini Nutrition Assessment–Short Form (MNA-SF) was developed to identify persons with undernutrition as part of a two-step screening process in which persons identified as “at risk” on the MNA-SF would receive additional assessment. The MNA-SF score (Table 217.4) was strongly correlated with the total MNA score, and for predicting undernutrition, the sensitivity was found to be 97.9%, the specificity was 100%, and the diagnostic accuracy was 98.7%.507 Currently, several well-validated tools exist to assess physical per- formance, muscle mass, and strength.306,327 Despite the relatively large number of tools available, their use may not always be feasible in daily clinical practice, and some of them may be of greater utility for the assessment of sarcopenia in research settings than in clinical practice. These tools are summarized in Table 217.5.

At present, no pharmacological treatment exists that is able to defini- tively halt the progression of sarcopenia or prevent the onset of age-as- sociated muscle wasting; however, several are currently at various stages of development (Table 217.6).508

## Myostatin Inhibition

The negative role of myostatin in muscle growth has led to the develop- ment of specific inhibitors of myostatin signaling shown to stimulate muscle growth or prevent muscle loss.468 Antibodies to myostatin have been developed.509 Myostatin antibodies have been shown to increase muscle mass and muscle fiber diameter in mice,510 and there is some evidence they may have similar effects in humans with sarcopenia.475 Soluble activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B) has been shown to be a potent myostatin inhibitor. Administration of soluble ACVR2B led to muscle hypertrophy in normal and myostatin-knockout mice.511 Bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to type II activin receptors (ActRII), was shown to dramatically increase skeletal mus- cle mass in mice. Bimagrumab (BYM338) enhances differentiation of primary human skeletal myoblasts and prevents myostatin- or activin A-induced atrophy through inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation.512 A recent pilot study investigated the effects of bimagrumab in treat- ment of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), a muscle-wasting disease characterized by enhanced muscle Smad2/3 phosphorylation. The bimagrumab-treated subjects had increased thigh muscle volume and lean body mass compared with placebo, as well as an improved 6-minute walking distance.513 In a study of older adults with sarcope- nia, a single dose of BYM338 increased thigh muscle volume, whereas there was no change with placebo. Participants receiving bimagrumab with a slower walking speed at baseline had a statistically significant greater improvements in gait speed and 6-minute walk distance than those receiving a placebo.514

## Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

Experimental and clinical studies have given insight into the role of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) in skeletal muscle. Evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be benefi- cial in the prevention515,516 and treatment517 of sarcopenia. RAS block- ade may decrease the decline of muscle performance and reduce the occurrence of frailty.518 Treatment with ACE inhibitors may improve exercise capacity by inducing favorable changes in skeletal muscle myosin heavy-chain composition.519 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 130 elderly participants (mean age 78.7) evaluated the effects of an ACE inhibitor on physical performance.520 At 20 weeks, 6-min- ute walking distance was significantly improved in the treatment group relative to placebo. Reduced expression of ACE resulting from a genetic polymorphism is associated with greater muscle anabolic response

## Anabolic Hormone Repletion

## Testosterone

Testosterone increases muscle mass and power, but it has a number of potentially limiting side effects.225,524,525 The therapeutic benefit of testosterone therapy for sarcopenia is thought to suppress skeletal muscle myostatin expression while simultaneously stimulating the Akt pathway,526 leading to increased muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and decreased muscle protein breakdown (MPD).527 Testosterone can increase muscle mass in persons with low testosterone levels528,529 and has been shown to improve function in older persons with frailty.530–532 Intramuscular (IM) injection of testosterone enanthate in healthy individuals induced a twofold increase in protein synthesis compared with control subjects,533 and a supraphysiological dose for 10 weeks in trained men produced a significant increase in strength and CSA of quadriceps.534 A 6-month, randomized, placebo-con- trolled trial reported increased lean body mass and strength in older men.535 These changes were associated with an increase in IGF-1 expression. Testosterone replacement also has been shown to increase muscle strength in women.536 Testosterone supplementation in elderly men for 20 weeks found dose-dependent increases in both type I and type II muscle fibers.537 At higher doses, testosterone enhances muscle strength through satellite-cell recruitment.538 Expression of androgen receptors has been demonstrated in satellite cells,539 which appear to be associated with androgen-induced muscle hypertrophy.540 Testosterone appears to be better than growth hormone at reversing the decline in strength that occurs with sarcopenia541; however, tes- tosterone replacement is not currently recommended in the treatment of sarcopenia due to high rates of side effects and low physical perfor- mance benefits.542

## Growth Hormone and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1

GH replacement therapy lowers fat mass and increases lean body mass. Rudman et al.543 reported that older (>61 years) men who received GH injections for 18 months increased their FFM by 6% while decreasing fat mass by 15%. GH administration resulted in a significant increase in mixed muscle protein synthesis in elderly women544; however, one study reported that GH increased muscle strength only when coupled with a weight-training program.545 Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF- 1) has been shown to activate satellite-cell proliferation and differen- tiation in muscle and to increase protein synthesis in existing fibers.546 In animal models, aging muscle has been shown capable of synthesiz- ing IGF-1; however, it may be less sensitive to its stimulatory effects226; this anabolic resistance may be reversed through resistance exercise. Although there is little clinical research support for the use of GH in the treatment of sarcopenia, GH supplementation is limited by safety issues.547 Potential serious side effects occur with GH supplementation in healthy adults, such as arthralgia, edema, and glucose intolerance.548 GH has been shown to increase mortality in hospitalized persons,549 and IGF-1 has been shown to correlate with the risk of prostate cancer in men, premenopausal breast cancer in women, and lung and colorec- tal cancer in both men and women.550

## Dehydroepiandrosterone

Cross-sectional studies have shown a progressive decline in blood DHEA levels after the second decade, resulting in about a 10% decline per decade.220,221 At 70 to 80 years of age, peak DHEAS concentra- tions are only 10% to 20% of those in young adults.551 Administration of DHEA in elderly subjects has been shown to increase DHEA blood levels and increase biologically active IGF-1,552 which has been shown

## Ghrelin Agonists

Ghrelin, a 28–amino acid peptide primarily produced in the gastric mucosa, has been identified as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR).558 Apart from its well-estab- lished effects in appetite stimulation,559 ghrelin possesses anti-inflam- matory effects249 and has been shown to enhance growth hormone release.560,561 Studies have demonstrated that ghrelin inhibits leptin- and activation-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression by human monocytes and T cells562 and NF- κ B activation in human endothelial cells.563 Plasma ghrelin levels have been found to be lower in elderly compared with younger subjects,564–566 and elderly subjects with sar- copenia have lower ghrelin levels than those without sarcopenia.567 Intravenous infusion of ghrelin in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) for 3 weeks showed improvements in exercise capacity, muscle strength, and lean body mass,568 which were unchanged in matched con- trols. Anamorelin, a ghrelin agonist, has been shown to enhance appetite and lean body mass, but not muscle function, in persons with cancer cachexia.569,570 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross- over trial found that oral administration of the ghrelin mimetic ibuta- moren (MK-677) for 12 months in healthy elderly subjects significantly increased GH and IGF-1 levels to that of younger adults and prevented lean mass loss without severe side effects.571

## Selective Androgen-Receptor Modulators

Selective androgen-receptor modulators (SARMs) are a class of andro- gen-receptor ligands that display tissue-selective activation of andro- genic signaling and have shown promise in increasing muscle mass and physical performance measures. A number of SARMs have undergone Phase I, II, and III trials. A 12-week Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that Enobosarm (GTx-024) treatment resulted in significant dose-de- pendent increases in total lean body mass (P < 0.001) and improve- ments in the Stair Climb Test (P = 0.013) compared with a placebo in 120 healthy elderly subjects.572 Results from a Phase III clinical trial evaluating Enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed a statistically significant increase in lean body mass (LBM) in subjects receiving 1 mg (P = 0.0012) and 3 mg (P = 0.046) of the drug but not in placebo controls.573 A 21-day ascending-dose study of the non- steroidal SARM LGD-4033 in 76 healthy young men showed that the drug increased LBM and leg-press strength and was well tolerated.574 In a study of 170 elderly women (age >65) with sarcopenia, treat- ment with another SARM, MK-773, produced statistically significant increases in LBM compared with placebo at 6 months; however, no significant improvement was seen in muscle strength or function.575 Both treatment and placebo groups in this study also received vitamin D and protein supplementation. SARMs have the potential to increase muscle mass and improve physical function across several populations without the unwanted effects on the prostate, skin, or hair that are commonly associated with testosterone or other nonselective anabolic steroids. The effect of SARMs on muscle mass and function, however, has been modest in comparison to the effects from treatment with sup- raphysiological doses of testosterone.530

## Exercise and Physical Activity

Exercise and physical activity are important considerations for both sarcopenia prophylaxis576,577 and management.578,579 Exercise training is a simple and inexpensive strategy to delay the onset of sarcopenia and reduce the rate of functional decline. Regular exercise has been shown to help maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and balance. Results from interventional studies have demonstrated that resistance training (RT) is the most effective intervention. A Cochrane review of 121 trials pro- vided evidence that progressive resistance training, performed two to three times weekly by older people, improved gait speed, TUG, stair climbing, and overall muscle strength.580 Trials of resistance exercise training in a frail older population have shown significant increases in 1-repetition maximal (1-RM) leg strength and improvements in SPPB scores.11 Jubrias et al.128 studied 40 elderly subjects (mean age 69.2 years) who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: con- trol, resistance training, or endurance training. Training for 24 weeks resulted in substantial improvement. Endurance training resulted in a substantial increase in the intensity of exercise that could be sustained for 40 minutes, and endurance-trained subjects had less phosphocre- atine breakdown and less acidosis during a standard stimulation exer- cise. Resistance training resulted in increased muscle cross-sectional area and increased mitochondrial volume density. Subjects in the resis- tance group increased their leg press by 64%. Similar findings were reported in other strength-training studies in elderly subjects,581–584 and RT has been shown to increase muscle size and strength in old,585 very old,586 and frail individuals.587 These results indicate that skeletal muscle adaptability is well maintained in older populations and pro- vides evidence that some of the functional muscular deficits seen with aging can be reversed with regular physical activity, resistance exercise in particular. Maintaining the benefits from RT has been shown possi- ble with as little as one training session per week.588 Resistance and isometric training techniques have demonstrated substantial improvements in muscle strength and metabolic capabil- ities. Resistance exercise has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis,589,590 reduce inflammation,159 increase mitochondrial func- tion,129 and improve myogenic signaling591 and satellite-cell activity.592 Resistance training performed over many weeks is a potent stimulator for skeletal muscle growth and strength gains.593 The dramatic increase in muscle size after resistance exercise is primarily the result of an increase in muscle fiber size (hypertrophy), with a minor contribution from an increase in fiber number (hyperplasia).594 According to Grimby,595 type II fibers show the most prominent increases in cross-sectional area after strength training in the elderly, and the increased mitochondrial volume that accompanies resistance training is consistent with improved endur- ance.596 Physical activity has been shown to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction in the elderly.127 Based on the correlation between muscle cross-sectional area and maximum force-generating capacity,597–599 it is not surprising that an increase in muscle size after resistance exer- cise is accompanied by an increase in maximal muscle strength.600,601 This increase can enhance the functional performance of an individual and also reduce the elevated risk of falling in older people. A structured, moderate-intensity physical activity program over 2.6 years reduced major mobility disability compared with a health education program in 1635 sedentary men and women aged 70 to 89.602 The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association have recommended the promotion of physical activity in older adults, emphasizing moderate-intensity aerobic activity and muscle-strength- ening activity and reducing sedentary behavior.603 (See Chapter 36, The Exercise Prescription, for a comprehensive presentation on strength-training protocols.)

## Dietary Modification

Nutritional modification or supplementation has been widely eval- uated as a potential intervention for the prevention or treatment of age-related physical impairments.604 Suboptimal micronutrient intake is very common in older adults,605 and a proper diet is critically important to slowing sarcopenia progression.606,607 Insufficient total caloric intake may lead to the development of sarcopenia608 or accel- erate its progression.609 Research is focused on specialized nutritional products rich in immunomodulating nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, phytochemicals (polyphenols, resveratrol, and catechins), and vitamin D, to attenuate inflammaging.610 Significant increases in cir- culating proinflammatory cytokines and cortisol due to caloric insuffi- ciency (CI) are among the triggers thought to contribute to age-related muscle decline.611–613 Further data indicate that lean muscle mass in older adults is significantly associated with dietary protein intake. In one study, 2066 women and men aged 70 to 79 years in the highest quintile of protein intake ( ∼ 1.1 g/kg/day) lost approximately 40% less LBM and appendicular LBM than did those in the lowest quintile ( ∼ 0.7 g/kg/day).606 It is well known that resistance exercise increases aging muscle mass and strength, and these physiological adaptations from exercise may be further enhanced with certain nutritional interventions. Uptake of amino acids by skeletal muscle readily occurs after the ingestion of a protein-containing meal, during which time skeletal muscles typically experience a net protein synthesis. Both resistance exercise590,614 and amino acid/protein ingestion615,616 stimulate muscle protein synthesis independently, and a combination of the two further augments mus- cle protein synthesis.617,618 Combined RT and nutritional intervention (whey protein and vitamin D) in 34 elderly patients for 3 months was found to significantly increase muscle strength, more than RT alone.619 Studies have shown that the timing and amount of amino acid ingestion are important for optimizing muscle protein synthesis after resistance exercise. Ingesting amino acids immediately before an exercise bout promotes a greater increase in muscle protein synthesis compared with ingestion immediately after,620 which is attributed to increased blood flow during exercise leading to increased amino acid delivery. The amount of protein ingested is also crucial to optimize the anabolic response from RT. The MPS dose response to ingested protein after an exercise bout appears to be altered with aging. It has been demonstrated that older individuals need to ingest twice as much protein (40 g) to maximally stimulate MPS after exercise,621 compared with the 20-g dose in healthy young subjects.622 This change in the dose–response relationship suggests older muscle may be less sensitive to amino acids, which has been termed anabolic resistance. Older per- sons may obtain inadequate protein in their diet, which may impair MPS,623 and older individuals suffering from protein-energy malnutri- tion (PEM) are unlikely to gain muscle mass and strength while engag- ing in RT.624 The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/ kg of body weight.625 Although many older adults consume adequate protein on the basis of current standards, a subset of older individuals have been shown to ingest protein intakes below the RDA.626 Kersetter et al. reported that 32% to 41% of women and 22% to 38% of men older than 50 years ingested less than the RDA for protein.627 Protein can therefore be considered a key shortfall nutrient for aging popu- lations, and it has been suggested that the current RDA for protein is inadequate for older adults because it fails to prevent muscle loss with aging.28,607,628–630 Increasing protein intake above the RDA, espe- cially in frail elderly individuals, could minimize the muscle loss seen in sarcopenia.631 Based on a nitrogen balance study, Campbell and colleagues recommend that protein intake should be increased to 0.91 g/kg/day in healthy older men and women.27 An increase in muscle was significantly enhanced in those elderly subjects who were supple- mented with protein during strength training, compared with their nonsupplemented counterparts.632 However, protein supplementa- tion without exercise has been shown to have little effect on improv- ing muscle mass.633 Another study found that 1.0 g of protein/kg/day was the minimal amount required to maintain muscle mass.634 The PROT-AGE study group, appointed by the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS), recommends average daily protein intake in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg body weight to maintain and regain lean body mass and function in older (>65 years) people,635 particularly in those who are actively participating in endurance- or resistance-type exercise. Levels of protein intake as high as 1.6 g/kg/day have been demonstrated to increase exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy in older persons.636 For individuals already diagnosed with sarcopenia, protein intake of at least 1.5 g/kg/day has been recommended.637 Cross-sectional analysis of dietary intake data has shown a relation- ship between total638 and per-meal639 protein intake on both muscle mass and function. There is a saturable dose–response relationship between the amount of protein consumed in a single meal/bolus and MPS, which has led some researchers to promote a balanced pattern of dietary protein intake—rather than generic per-diem guidelines—to provide a more optimal per-meal stimulation of MPS, especially in the prevention or treatment of sarcopenia.640 Results from muscle protein anabolism, appetite regulation, and satiety research support recom- mendations for a per-meal protein threshold (25 to 30 g protein per meal, containing approximately 2.5 to 2.8 g of leucine)641 for older individuals in lieu of the less-specific RDA.637,642 Muscle tissue preferentially catabolizes some amino acids more than others, which can influence the anabolic response of muscle to protein. Six amino acids (aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, leucine, iso- leucine, and valine) appear to be catabolized to a greater extent in skel- etal muscle than in other tissues. Supplementation of essential amino acids (EAAs) has been shown to improve grip strength and 6-minute walking distance in elderly subjects after 3 months.643 Treatment with 8 g of EAAs over 18 months in a randomized trial of 41 elderly per- sons (aged 66 to 84 years) with sarcopenia resulted in increased muscle mass, a significant increase in IGF-1 and a significantly reduced TNF- α .644 The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine, isoleucine, and leucine appear to be the primary stimulus of protein synthesis645 and have been estimated to represent 14% to 18% of the total amino acid content of skeletal muscles.646 Leucine appears to be the most potent of these BCAAs,647 producing its anabolic effects in muscle by stimulating the mTOR pathway648 via the leucine-binding protein Sestrin2.649,650 Leucine supplementation stimulates muscle protein accretion in cul- tured cells,651 and infusion with L-leucine has been shown to reduce muscle protein degradation in healthy men.652 Leucine is one of the few amino acids completely oxidized in the muscle for energy. When combined with exercise training, BCAA supplementation increases testosterone and decreases cortisol.653 The ingestion of whey protein has been shown to stimulate postprandial muscle protein accretion more efficiently than casein,654 which was attributed to whey protein’s higher leucine content and absorption kinetics.

## Manipulation of Gut Microbiota

The composition and function of the human gut microbiota have been linked to the age-related decline of physical performance, and microbi- ome-targeted interventions may hold therapeutic potential in prevent- ing or treating sarcopenia. The human gastrointestinal tract is known to house more than 1000 distinct bacterial species, for a total of about 1014 microorganisms.655 Although the human microbiome is domi- nated by four bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria),656 each host has a unique biological relationship

## 1798SECTION 6 Diseases

with its gut microbiota.657 Many host properties, including diet, age, gender, genome, and relative pharmaceutical load, can exert selective pressure on the microbiota.655 The gut microbiota influence nutrient bioavailability, glucose and lipid metabolism, immune system condi- tioning, and drug metabolism,658–660 and dysregulated host–microbe interactions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of conditions, including obesity, insulin resistance, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis.661–663 Aging has been associated with specific changes in gut microbiota,664 and resilience of the enteric microflora is generally reduced with advancing age.665 The structure and function of the gut microbiota can be affected by age-related physi- ological changes in gastrointestinal function or altered diet and lifestyle factors, which may eventually lead to low-grade chronic inflammation, malnutrition, adverse drug reactions, and greater infection suscepti- bility as well as possibly accelerated progression of chronic diseases, frailty, and sarcopenia.666,667 Claesson et al. demonstrated that species richness (the number of taxa that metagenomic analyses are able to detect) of the fecal microbiota of 178 older subjects is inversely related to physical performance.668 Analysis of data from 371 ELDERMET cohort subjects revealed that the presence of frailty in communi- ty-dwelling elderly individuals was associated with a gut microbiome profile similar to that of nursing home residents,669 and gut dysbiosis was associated with reduced survival in a study of 76 elderly hospital- ized patients with frailty or disability.670 Altered gut microbiota may be involved in the onset of physical frailty: reduced representation of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is known to produce fecal short- chain fatty acids (SCFAs), has been observed in frail subjects.667 Evidence suggests that therapeutic manipulation of the enteric microflora might be harnessed to obtain therapeutic gains in old age,671 although studies investigating prebiotic or probiotic administration on skeletal muscle function have mainly focused on animal models.672 In a recent 13-week trial of 60 elderly subjects investigating the effects of prebiotics on muscle function, the treatment group (fructooligo- saccharides and inulin) demonstrated improved handgrip strength compared with placebo.673 Evidence from animal studies suggests that physical exercise can modulate gut microbiota composition,674 leading to increased gut biodiversity and mucosal integrity, reduced inflam- mation, and improved metabolic function.675–677

## -Methyl Butyrate

β -Hydroxy- β -methyl butyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, is believed to improve protein anabolism in muscle, and its supplementa- tion has been used as a potential treatment for sarcopenia.678 HMB has been shown to attenuate body weight and muscle loss in experimental cancer cachexia by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway679 and to stimulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats.680 HMB supplementa- tion may promote hepatic IGF-1 production, resulting in skeletal mus- cle protein synthesis and attenuation of muscle mass loss via increased mTOR expression681 and increases in satellite-cell content, myonuclei number, and total DNA content.682 Treatment with HMB resulted in reduced apoptotic signaling and increased satellite-cell content after dis- use in aged rat muscles compared with controls.683,684 Based on these observations, HMB is claimed to increase strength and FFM and to max- imize muscle mass gains during resistance training.685,686 Results from a meta-analysis of nine studies687 indicate that HMB supplementation promotes gains in muscle mass and strength with RT. Interestingly, these positive effects appear to be evident only in conditions in which muscle proteolysis is more pronounced, such as in unconditioned individuals exposed to acute exercise training; these responses are not demonstrated in athletes and well-trained individuals, which is believed to result from training-induced suppression of muscle protein degradation.688–690 A more recent meta-analysis of seven trials concluded that HMB sup- plementation contributes to the preservation of muscle mass in older adults and may help prevent bed-rest–induced muscle atrophy.691 HMB is present in some foods, such as citrus fruits, fish, and breast milk, and a small amount is endogenously produced (a 70-kg individual produces about 0.2 g to 0.4 g daily) in consequence of leucine oxidation.692 Most studies with human subjects have employed 3 g/day, and supplementa- tion would be required to achieve therapeutic levels that demonstrate muscle gains and inhibition of proteolysis. Doses higher than 3.0 g/ day do not appear to further increase strength or FFM. Gallagher et al. demonstrated that 3.0 g/day produced better results for FFM gain than did 1.5 and 6.0 g/day.693 In an earlier study, untrained individuals were given one of three doses of HMB (0, 1.5, or 3.0 g/day) and were sub- jected to a resistance-training regimen for 3 weeks. Despite no alter- ation in body composition, total strength increased in a dose-dependent manner: 8%, 13%, and 13.4% for 0, 1.5, and 3.0 g/day, respectively.692 Vukovich et al.694 randomized 31 70-year old men and women into two groups, placebo and HMB supplementation (3 g/day), in conjunction with a 5-day/week exercise program. HMB supplementation promoted an increased percentage of body fat loss assessed by skin-fold estima- tion and CT. The effects of HMB supplementation on strength does not appear to differ by gender.695 Up to 76 mg/kg/day (equivalent to ∼ 5.3 g/day in a 70-kg individual) for 8 weeks appears to be safe and does not adversely affect hepatic and renal function in young adult males.696 HMB as a free acid gel, compared with HMB calcium salt, resulted in faster and greater plasma concentrations (+185%) and improved clear- ance (+25%) of HMB from plasma, suggesting HMB as a free acid gel may be the optimal delivery form due to increased bioavailability.697

## Creatine

Creatine has been shown to exert anabolic effects on muscle mass. Creatine supplementation may increase muscle accretion during resistance training through up-regulation of myogenic transcription factors.698 Oral creatine supplementation (20 g/day) was found to atten- uate the loss of muscle mass and strength during 7 days of unilateral upper arm immobilization,699 and 0.5 g/day of creatine monohydrate for 14 weeks resulted in significantly greater increases in FFM and total body mass compared with a placebo700 in elderly adults participating in a resistance exercise program 3 days per week. In a similar study of elderly (67 years to 80 years) subjects, 20 g creatine monohydrate for 8 weeks did not result in additional improvements in body composi- tion, strength, or endurance.701 Creatine supplementation, when com- bined with resistance training, was found to increase lean tissue mass and improve muscle strength, endurance, and power in elderly sub- jects,702,703 whereas other studies found no benefit.704,705 Volek et al.706 demonstrated a significant increase in muscle fiber CSA after 12 weeks of resistance training in conjunction with creatine supplementation, which was greater than the increase with resistance training alone. In a study of women and men 65 to 86 years, creatine supplementation for 14 days increased maximal isometric grip strength and physical work- ing capacity at fatigue threshold.707 A recent meta-analysis found that creatine supplementation during RT programs (>6 weeks) enhanced gains in LBM, strength, and functional performance over RT alone.708 Creatine alone or with conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) increased lean body mass and improved strength.709,710 Low-dose creatine (0.1g/kg body weight) together with a protein supplement (0.3 g/kg) increased lean mass and upper limb strength.711 Exogenous sources of creatine are predominantly animal foods, especially meat and fish. Hepatic syn- thesis contributes an estimated 1 to 2 g per day, involving arginine, glycine, and methionine.712 Approximately 95% of creatine stores are found in skeletal muscle,713 and a decrease in intramuscular creatine levels in advanced age has been documented.714

## Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFAs) may be useful for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Dietary PUFAs reduce adipose tissue inflammation in humans715 and have been shown to repress TNF- α signaling pathways in mice.716 Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was found to restore skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity717 and was associated with increased transcriptional regula- tors of mitochondrial biogenesis in old mice.718 A recent open-label intervention of 3.9 g n3-PUFA per day (2.7 and 1.2 g EPA and docosa- hexaenoic acid [DHA], respectively) for 16 weeks was shown to induce favorable adaptations within skeletal muscle in older adults (65 to years), including decreased mitochondrial ROS production, increased muscle protein synthesis rates, and enhanced anabolic response to a single bout of exercise.719 When incorporated with strength training in elderly women, n3-PUFA supplementation was shown to enhance skeletal muscle activation and force more than with strength training alone.720 n3-PUFA supplementation, in association with an anabolic stimulus, has been shown to counteract anabolic resistance and sarco- penia. Long-chain n3-PUFAs have been shown to have anabolic prop- erties in healthy young and middle-aged adults,721 and studies show that the anabolic stimuli from amino acids, hormones, and/or physical activity in skeletal muscle can be enhanced by long-term fish oil sup- plementation.722 Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to attenuate muscle wasting in cancer treatment723 and improve the MPS response to amino acid administration.724 Individuals receiving 4 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids for 8 weeks demonstrated a significant increase in MPS with coadministration of amino acids, which the authors sug- gest may be due to amplification of the stimulatory effects of amino acids on the mTOR signaling pathway. Recent studies suggest that intake of omega-3 fatty acids is inversely associated with biomarkers of inflammation such as CRP and IL-6.725 EPA has been shown to inhibit NF- κ B726,727 and reduce TNF- α production.728 Epidemiological data also suggest that consumption of fatty fish rich in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids may prevent sarcope- nia. In a cross-sectional retrospective study of 2983 older adults in the UK, an increase in grip strength (of 0.48 kg in women and 0.43 kg in men) was observed for each additional portion of fatty fish consumed per week.729 These relationships were independent of adult height, age, or birth weight. There is no established Dietary Reference Intake for n3-PUFAs; however, the Adequate Intake (AI) for α -linolenic acid (ALA) is set at 1.1 and 1.6 g/day for adult women and men, respec- tively, and the AI for linoleic acid (LA) for adult women and men is and 14 g/day, respectively.730


Research indicates that vitamin D may have beneficial effects on aging muscle biology, and there is evidence to suggest a protective role for vitamin D supplementation in older adults to preserve lean body mass and muscle strength and prevent frailty. The active hormone α , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 promotes muscle cell growth, which may lead to improved muscle function.731 Evidence from randomized studies in institutionalized frail elderly subjects demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly improves body sway and lower extrem- ity strength, reducing the risk of falls.732 A meta-analysis of five RCTs including 1237 elderly individuals evaluated the effect of treatment with vitamin D for 2 months up to 3 years on falls risk (doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU/day with or without 1200 mg calcium). Treatment with vitamin D reduced the risk of falling by 22% (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92) compared with patients receiving calcium or placebo.733 A more recent meta-analysis of eight RCTs involving 2426 individuals >65 years determined that supplemental vitamin D (700 IU to IU daily), which resulted in 25(OH)D concentrations ≥ 60 nmol/L, reduced fall risk by 23%.734 A Cochrane review including 60 trials and 60,345 participants concluded that vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing the rate of falls in care facilities.735 Prolonged (2 months to 20 months) vitamin D supplementation with 800 IU/day has been demonstrated to improve muscle strength and/or physical performance in frail older adults736 and older individuals with vitamin D deficiency.737 Older ambulatory subjects (n = 139, ≥ 65 years) with a history of falls and 25(OH)D levels ≤ 12 μ g/L were randomized to receive a single intramuscular injection of 600,000 IU of ergocalciferol or a placebo.738 Aggregate Function Performance Time (AFPT), Choice Reaction Time (CRT), and postural sway measures improved in the intervention group and deteriorated in the control group; no signifi- cant difference in change in muscle strength was observed between the groups. In community-dwelling older adults who had low vitamin D status (<16 ng/mL), 400 IU daily over a period of 9 months along with exercise training resulted in a significant improvement in physical per- formance (TUG test) over training alone.739,740 Recent meta-analyses concluded that supplemental vitamin D in daily doses of 800 to IU consistently demonstrated beneficial effects on strength741 and bal- ance,742 and repletion in vitamin D-deficient persons has been shown to increase muscle strength and prevent falls.742,743 Supplementation with vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein for 13 weeks improved appendicular muscle mass and lower extremity function among older adults with sarcopenia.744 Another study of 160 postmenopausal women demonstrated that vitamin D administration (1000 IU/day) for 9 months significantly increased muscle strength and prevented loss of muscle mass compared with placebo.745 Vitamin D supplementation in older persons has been shown to reduce the incidence of falls, posi- tively affect muscle-fiber composition,746,747 and enhance RT-induced increases in muscle mass, strength, and function.748 For many elderly individuals, it may be difficult to reach the daily recommendation for vitamin D consumption without supplementa- tion. Certain age-related changes contribute to an increased require- ment for vitamin D in older adults, including decreased endogenous synthesis, decreased intestinal absorption, and impaired conversion to active D 3 (calcitriol). Evidence indicates a reduced ability of the aging kidney to dihydroxylate 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvita- min D,749 which may be due to reduced expression of 25-hydroxyvi- tamin D-1 α -hydroxylase.750 Intestinal absorption of vitamin D is adversely affected with aging via increased resistance of the duodenal Ca2+ transport mechanism to the stimulatory action of 1,25(OH) 2 D.751,752 An age-related decrease occurs in the rate of skin conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D 3 . The ability to synthesize vita- min D decreases with aging, and vitamin D synthesis has been shown to decrease by approximately 75% by age 70.493 Many chronic diseases can cause vitamin D deficiency, including malabsorption syndromes, kidney disease, and hyperthyroidism, and several medications can alter vitamin D absorption, synthesis, or metabolism.493,753 The AI for vita- min D among men and women between the ages of 51 and 70 years is 400 IU (10 μ g) per day; for men and women above the age of years, the AI increases to 600 IU (15 μ g) per day.753 A serum 25(OH) D level below 25 nmol/L has been associated with decreased muscle strength29 and a level below 50 nmol/L with increased body sway.100 It has been recommended that 25(OH)D levels be measured in long- term care residents754 and all older patients with muscle loss.624 The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended 1000 IU (15 μ g) of vitamin D (which has since been reduced, as noted previously) in high-risk populations such as the elderly; this amount aims to increase the circulating concentration of 25 (OH) D to 80 nmol/L.755 Evidence from research trials and dosing studies has shown that 40 IU (1 μ g) of cholecalciferol daily raises serum 25(OH)D by 2 nmol/L in persons with serum levels <50 nmol/L.756 Concentrations of 25(OH)D in older

persons have been increased 50 nmol/L to 65 nmol/L to means of nmol/L with 800 IU/day.757,758 A supplemental dose of vitamin D 3 of 4000 IU/day is the “offi- cial” safe upper limit.759 Evidence suggests that absorption of vitamin D from supplements ranges from 55% to 99% and may be greater than absorption from food sources.753 Elderly persons have the same absorption rate of pharmacological doses as younger subjects,760 and doses of 50,000 IU a week are safe.761 Although vitamin D 3 appears to have greater bioavailability that D 2 ,762 vitamin D 2 has been shown to be equally as effective as vitamin D 3 in maintaining 25(OH)D levels.763 However, this is a different molecule than that formed from natural D3 and is less physiologically active. In vitro studies indicate that D 3 sup- plementation can affect reproductive hormone levels in a tissue-spe- cific manner.764–768


Evidence suggests that vitamin E may enhance muscle regeneration and mitigate the age-associated skeletal muscle dysfunction seen in sar- copenia.769 Ble et al. found that age- and gender-adjusted plasma levels of vitamin E were significantly lower in frail individuals compared with nonfrail counterparts, suggesting an association between low vitamin E and the presence of frailty.770 Vitamin E is protective against oxi- dative stress and inflammatory age-related diseases.771 Preclinical and human experimental studies show that vitamin E positively affects muscle mass, muscle contractile properties,772 exercise capacity,773 mitochondrial function,774 and myoblast proliferation and differ- entiation.775 Vitamin E supplementation (800 IU/day α -tocopherol) for 28 days resulted in decreased oxidative stress markers after unac- customed exercise compared with a placebo.776 Tocotrienols reduced DNA damage in a trial of 64 subjects (aged 37 to 78 years) who received 160 mg tocotrienols or a placebo for 6 months.777 Interestingly, in the same study, tocotrienol supplementation was found to decrease protein damage and reduce serum advanced glycosylation end prod- ucts (AGEs) in adults aged >50 years.778 Increased levels of AGEs in skeletal muscle have been observed with advancing age,779 and AGE accumulation appears to contribute to decreased muscle function with aging.780 Several studies have shown a significant association between increased AGEs and reduced muscle strength and physical performance.464,781,782 Studies have demonstrated positive associations between serum tocopherol level and muscle strength. Vitamin E daily intake has been shown to positively correlate with knee extension and physical performance in a data subset of the InCHIANTI study.783 Vitamin E deficiency can lead to nutritional myopathy,784 and animal models of α -tocopherol deficiency have been shown to affect skeletal muscle strength and function.785,786 Vitamin E deficiency is associated with sarcopenia, and both high intake and serum concentrations of vitamin E have been associated with reduced risk of incident frailty and decreased physical function. Inadequate vitamin E intake is highly prevalent in communi- ty-dwelling elderly populations in the United States, with only 2% to 8% of women and 8% to 11% of men meeting the estimated average requirement (EAR) for vitamin E from foods alone in the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) conducted from to 1996787 and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 2001 to 2002.788 Although suboptimal micronutrient intake is common, particularly for older adults, hos- pitalization influences nutritional status because both pathological conditions and their treatment can cause or worsen malnutrition.789 An observational study of 166 participants (mean age 76.3 years, 65% female) observed a high prevalence of inadequate nutritional status and a clear decreasing trend with age for α -tocopherol (mean 1.38 ng/dL in 65 to 75 age group; 1.26 ng/dL between 76 to 85; and 1.14 mg/dL >85 years).790 The prevalence of inadequacy was espe- cially high in hospitalized patients compared with outpatients (1.19 mg/dL and 1.35 mg/dL, respectively, p < 0.011). The normal serum range of vitamin E ( α -tocopherol) for adults is 5 to 18 mg/L (14 to 40 μ mol/L).791 The EAR for vitamin E in adults ≥ 51 years is 12 mg/ day (27.9 μ mol/L), the RDA for the same age group is 15 mg/dL (35 μ mol/L), and the TUIL has been set at 1000 mg/day.792 Vitamin E is found in many plants, especially seeds, oil derivatives, grains, fruits, and vegetables.793 Evidence exists to suggest tocotrienol has superior antioxidant properties794 and possesses unique biological functions not shared by tocopherols.795 It is recommended that vitamin E supplementation should include the full spectrum of vitamin E iso- mers (4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols) insofar as possible.784,796,797 Researchers are investigating vitamin E gene interactions and spe- cific polymorphisms affecting vitamin E bioactivity to help guide the development of personalized, nutrigenomic vitamin E supplementa- tion and better elucidate therapeutic implications in the treatment of sarcopenia.771

## Vitamin B

<!-- chunk -->

## 12

Sarcopenia may be related to vitamin B 12 deficiency, which may occur independently of nutritional intake. Vitamin B 12 deficiency is common in the elderly, and the prevalence increases with age.798 In one study, 4-meter walking speed, handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass, and serum B 12 levels were assessed in 403 outpatient older adults.799 The prevalence of sarcopenia in this study cohort was 24.8%, whereas the frequency of sarcopenia was 31.6% in patients with B 12 levels <400 pg/mL. In addition, lean body mass and skeletal muscle mass index were lower in subjects with low vitamin B 12 levels (<400 pg/mL) compared with those with B 12 levels >400 pg/mL (p < 0.05). A cross-sectional study of 680 elderly participants (mean age 79, 65% female) found no association between serum B 12 lev- els and sarco-osteoporotic status.800 Analysis of data from a subset of 238 participants from the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study801 demonstrated that aging and frailty are associated with a higher prevalence of functional B 12 deficiency as detected by increased methyl-malonic acid (MMA) in plasma. MMA values tend to rise in the elderly,802 which is believed to reflect inadequate B 12 intake or absorption. The range for serum MMA that represents expected variability is 73 to 271 nmol/L.803 Amnionless, a vitamin B 12 corecep- tor that anchors the B 12 transport complex to epithelial membranes, was also measured and was found to positively correlate with MMA (p = 0.00068). These findings suggest that amnionless may serve as a candidate biomarker for perturbed B 12 bioavailability during aging and/or physical frailty. The EAR for vitamin B 12 in adults ≥ 51 years is μ g/day, the RDA for the same age group is 2.4 μ g/day, and there is insufficient data for deriving a TUIL for B 12 .804 It is estimated between 10% and 15% of people over the age of 60 have vitamin B 12 deficiency.

## Resveratrol

Research suggests that resveratrol may attenuate the decline in aging skeletal muscle through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions and enhanced satellite-cell regulation. In aged rats, resveratrol was shown to result in a modest improvement in satellite-cell prolifera- tion after hindlimb suspension compared with control,806 resulting in improved muscle mass during reloading. Resveratrol was shown to have a protective effect against oxidative stress in skeletal mus- cle through the expression of antioxidant enzymes in young and old rats.208 Results from other animal studies suggest that resveratrol may have profound protective effects against oxidative stress in aged mus- cle.807–809 Resveratrol appears to enhance the activity of sirtuins 1 and

2810 and NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, which have been iden- tified as important regulators of skeletal muscle gene expression.811,812 Resveratrol may therefore possess anti-inflammatory actions in skel- etal muscle, through activation of PGC1 α , which in turn activates farsenoid x receptor (FXR), PPAR β , and PPAR δ , which have anti-in- flammatory effects.813,814 Although these results are promising, the beneficial effects of resveratrol on aspects of sarcopenia have yet to be determined in human clinical trials.

## Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate and Green Tea Catechins

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), one of the most abundant catechins in green tea (Camellia sinensis), has been shown to have strong antioxi- dant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may be beneficial in the treatment of sarcopenia. A green tea extract containing approximately 50% EGCg was found to increase satellite-cell proliferation and dif- ferentiation in the muscles of aged rats after hindlimb suspension.815 Markers for satellite-cell activation (Myf5, MyoD) were improved after EGCg administration for 7 days, and treatment with EGCg was shown to reduce myostatin.816 Green tea catechin supplementation has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in both cultured cells817 and after eccentric exercise.818 Compared with controls, treatment with green tea catechins appears to reduce apoptotic signaling in activated satel- lite cells,815 which may be due to up-regulation of antioxidants and a reduction in oxidative stress and/or inflammation.819,820 (See Chapter 60, Camellia sinensis, for a comprehensive presenta- tion on this useful botanical medicine.)

## Antioxidants

Natural defense mechanisms against oxidative damage include specific and nonspecific antioxidants. Antioxidants, including vitamin C and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, are inversely associated with measures of sarcopenia.467,783 An animal aging study demonstrated that supple- mentation with rutin, vitamin E, vitamin A, zinc, and selenium restores the ability to stimulate protein synthesis subsequent to leucine admin- istration.821 Epidemiological studies in community-dwelling older adults have shown that low serum carotenoids are independently asso- ciated with low skeletal muscle strength and development of functional limitation and walking disability.822 Results from the InCHIANTI study revealed that low plasma levels of selenium823 and carotenoids824 may be independent predictors of all-cause mortality among commu- nity-dwelling older adults. Plasma carotenoids are considered a valid biological marker for fruit and vegetable intake.825 Higher total serum carotenoid concentrations were associated with faster walking speeds in 687 elderly women,826 suggesting that higher fruit and vegetable intakes may be protective against declines in lower extremity perfor- mance. Other studies have shown that decreased muscle strength is associated with low levels of selenium,827,828 carotenoids,829,830 and vitamin E.770,831 Protective effects from fruit and vegetable consumption have been attributed to the presence in these foods of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, carotenoids, and other plant polyphenols. These natu- rally occurring phytochemicals have the ability to act as antioxidants and inhibit oxidative stress.832 Mechanisms by which phytochemicals contribute to natural antioxidant defense systems include the inhibi- tion of ROS formation and the interruption of radical chain reactions. Phytochemical antioxidants prevent the formation of ROS by inhib- iting enzymes or chelating trace elements involved in free-radical production.833 In addition to their antioxidant properties, many phyto- chemicals have been shown to be biologically active and protect against disease-related biological pathways, such as cell signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and inflammation.834 Recent studies suggest that high fruit and vegetable intake reduces biomarkers of inflammation, such as IL-6, IL-18, and CRP.835 Carotenoids ( α - and β -carotene, β -cryptox- anthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene) act as free-radical scavengers, modulate immune responses, and reduce inflammation.836 Flavonoids account for about two thirds of polyphenols, the most abundant group of dietary antioxidants. Polyphenols have been shown to reduce inflam- mation and oxidative stress.837 Manach et al. reviewed 97 bioavailability studies of various classes of polyphenols, which revealed wide variabil- ity.838 They found that the polyphenols that are most well absorbed in humans are isoflavones and gallic acid, followed by catechins, fla- vanones, and quercetin glucosides; the least well-absorbed polyphe- nols are the proanthocyanidins, the galloylated tea catechins, and the anthocyanins. Bioavailability does not necessarily predict biological activity in vivo, however, as demonstrated by Williamson and Manach in a review of 93 intervention studies.839 Polyphenols shown to have effects on plasma antioxidant biomarkers include monomeric catechins (found in high concentrations in tea), procyanidins (oligomeric cate- chins found in red wine, grapes, cocoa, cranberries, apples, and some supplements such as Pycnogenol and grape seed extract), and quercetin (flavonol found in onions, apples, red wine, broccoli, tea, and Ginkgo biloba). Whole-food sources of antioxidants include pinto, red, and black beans; russet potatoes; plums; apples; cherries; prunes; pecans; and berries such as cranberry, blueberry, raspberry, and blackberry.840 Specific antioxidant micronutrients appear to suppress oxidative pathways believed to contribute to the inflammatory characteristics observed in sarcopenia. Evidence suggests that antioxidants decrease the levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF- α ,841,842 elevated levels of which are associated with physical decline in older persons.843 Longitudinal analyses of data from the Women’s Health and Aging Study I (WHAS I) demonstrated that participants with the lowest levels of α - and β -carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids were signifi- cantly more likely to have increasing IL-6 levels over a 2-year period.841 Those with the lowest selenium levels had a significantly higher risk of all-cause 5-year mortality. Vitamin C and E supplementation attenu- ated the increase in markers of oxidative stress in response to chronic repetitive muscle loading in aged rats,844 and vitamin C and E coadmin- istration with a blend of polyphenols and carotenoids for 10 months resulted in significantly increased GSH activity in the skeletal muscle of senescence-accelerated mice.845 Low serum selenium was independently associated with low muscle mass in a cross-sectional observational study of 327 community-dwelling elderly (mean age 71.5 years) subjects.846 (See Chapter 81, Flavonoids—Quercetin, Citrus Flavonoids, and Hydroxyethylrutosides, for a comprehensive discussion of the use of nutritional supplements to increase muscle mass.)

## Muscle Atrophy Prevention

Evidence from animal studies has shown that Curcuma longa can pre- vent muscle atrophy by stimulating the expression of glucose-regulated protein 94 kDa (Grp94) in myogenic cells.847 Grp94 is a sarcoendo- plasmic reticulum chaperone involved in the attenuation of myofiber atrophy, the levels of which decrease significantly in unloaded muscle. Oral supplementation of 400 mg/day of curcumin was associated with blunting of serum inflammatory markers (CK, IL-8, and TNF- α ), but had no positive effect muscle soreness, in an experimental model of exercise-induced muscle damage.848 Consumption of Chlorella appears to prevent age-related muscle atrophy in mice, possibly due to its antioxidant properties, its BCAA content, or through enhanced mitochondrial function.849 Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the most abundant catechin in Camellia sinensis, attenuated TNF- α –induced depression of protein synthesis in murine myotubes,850 suggesting EGCg may be effective in halting the skeletal muscle catabolism seen in sarcopenia.

## 1802SECTION 6 Diseases

Isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) from Glycine max were shown to induce expression of SIRT1 mRNA and phosphorylation of AMP kinase in vitro as well as suppress MuRF1 promoter activity and TNF- α –induced atrophy in C2C12 myotubes,851 suggesting isoflavones may be effective in reducing inflammation-associated muscle atrophy. However, a 6-month clinical study of 70 sedentary postmenopausal women found that irrespective of physical exercise, isoflavones (70 mg/day) did not improve muscle strength or reduce risks of mobility impairment.852

## Muscle Regeneration and Differentiation

There is evidence to suggest that several botanical medicines can pos- itively influence skeletal muscle anabolism and improve muscle mass. In a proof-of-concept trial in humans, 7-day treatment with epicat- echin (flavanol in C. sinensis) at 1 mg/kg/day was found to increase grip strength and the ratio of plasma follistatin:myostatin.816 Green tea extracts were found to significantly decrease NF- κ B activity of regenerating muscle fibers in mdx mice compared with controls.853 In a 3-month trial of 128 elderly women with sarcopenia, Kim et al. demonstrated that green tea catechin supplementation (350-mL bev- erage fortified with 540 mg catechins) combined with physical exercise had a beneficial effect on physical function and muscle mass compared with control.854 Proanthocyanidins of Vitis vinifera (125 mg/kg/d) enhanced the growth of skeletal muscle fibers in aged rats, which led to significantly increased muscle weight.806 In a pilot study of 91 middle-aged (40 to 60 years) women, grape seed proanthocyanidins (100 or 200 mg/d) for 8 weeks resulted in increased muscle mass.855 Resveratrol (125 mg/kg/ day) from Vitis vinifera resulted in favorable changes to type IIA and type IIB muscle fiber CSA and reduction of apoptotic signaling in mus- cles of old male rats.806 A prospective, open-label study evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of Withania somnifera (750 to 1250 mg/day over 30 days) in young (aged 18 to 30 years) healthy volunteers demonstrated a significant increase in muscle strength,856 and 500 to 750 mg twice daily for 3 months of W. somnifera improved muscle strength in 35 elderly individuals.857


Whole-body vibration (WBV) appears to positively affect balance, muscle function, and physical performance, which would be of benefit in the treatment of the skeletal muscle decline seen in sarcopenia.858 Several human trials have demonstrated improvements in muscle strength859 and reduced risk of falls.860 A randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of 6 months of WBV training and/or vitamin D supplementation on balance, physical performance, and estimated fall risk in 113 elderly (mean age 79.6 years) institutionalized women.861 All participants received either 880 or 1600 IU of vitamin D 3 per day and were assigned to either the no-training group or WBV (perform- ing exercises on a vibration platform 3×/week). Sway velocity and maximal isometric knee extension improved only in the WBV group, and the improvements in the WBV group in endurance capacity, walk- ing at referred speed, and TUG performance were significantly larger than the changes with vitamin D supplementation alone. A recent meta-analysis of seven studies involving 933 participants found that side-alternating sinusoidal WBV seems to have a benefi- cial effect on dynamic balance in the elderly.862 Training sessions typ- ically consisted of 3 to 10 series of 30 to 60 seconds of WBV with seconds of rest between at frequencies ranging between 5 and 26 Hz. Commonly, participants performed dynamic physical exercises during WBV. Another systematic review of 16 trials found that WBV training significantly improved knee muscle isometric strength, muscle power, and balance control in comparison with a control group.863 These results suggest that WBV may be a safe, low-demand, and effective candidate therapy for musculoskeletal strengthening, postural control, and performance improvement that can easily be carried out in clinical settings. Whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) has similarly been shown to have beneficial effects on muscle mass, strength, and power parameters in the elderly, with equal effects compared with conven- tional RT.864 The Training and ElectroStimulation Trial (TEST-III) enrolled 76 elderly women (mean age 75 years), who were randomly assigned to either WB-EMS (performed 18 minutes, 1.5 sessions per week) or control groups.865 After 54 weeks, significant intergroup dif- ferences were determined for ALM (p = 0.009) and maximal isometric strength (p = 0.003). WBV or WB-EBM may prove to be safe, effective alternatives for maintaining lean body mass and strength in elderly subjects unable or unwilling to perform dynamic strength exercises.


Age-related sarcopenia can compromise physical function, increase the risk of disability, and lower the quality of life in older adults. In May 2012, a Sarcopenia Consensus Summit was convened by the Foundation of the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Aging, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A task force of world- wide sarcopenia experts from the International Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research (ICFSR) proposed that progress in treating sarcopenia will require strengthening of global partnerships among academia, industry, and government agencies to reach consensus on diagnostic criteria, optimize clinical trial design, and identify improved treatment and preventive strategies.866 There are no available pharmaceutical treatments for sarcopenia, but evidence shows that resistance training is a viable and relatively low-cost treatment. Maintaining an active lifestyle with regular peri- ods of aerobic and resistance training, in combination with adequate protein, is believed to reduce the prevalence of sarcopenia in elderly populations. Nutritional supplementation is effective in the treatment of sarcopenia, and its positive effects increase when associated with physical exercise.867 A recent interventional trial in older persons with limited mobility showed that twice-daily intake of a supplement pro- viding 21 g protein, 10 g EAAs, 3 g leucine, and 800 IU vitamin D for a period of 12 weeks significantly improved muscle mass and the results on a chair stand test.868 It is currently recommended to measure serum 25(OH)D levels in all patients with sarcopenia and to prescribe supple- mentation (at least 800 IU/day) to those with values lower than 40 ng/ mL (100 nmol/L).869

## Physical Activity

Endurance and resistance exercises are recommended at individual- ized levels that are safe and tolerated. Progressive and dynamic resis- tance training that uses both concentric and eccentric movements should be encouraged, and a program targeting lower extremity muscles should be prioritized due to their importance in mobility, gait, and balance.870 The ACSM recommends that elderly subjects participate in RT of 65% to 75% maximum 1 to 3 days per week, for no more than 1 hour per session and with at least 48 hours between sessions.547,603


Encourage a well-balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, along with adequate amounts ( ≥ 1.5 g/kg/day) of quality protein and fatty acids. Aim to provide 0.3 to 0.5 g/kg protein at each meal to opti- mize MPS. Supplement with whey protein as a source of leucine, if tolerated.

## 1805CHAPTER 218 Seborrheic Dermatitis

these results, oral and parenteral applications of pyridoxine have shown little success. However, in the sicca form of the disorder (involvement of the scalp [dandruff], brow, nasolabial folds, and bearded area with varying degrees of greasy adherent scales on an erythematous base), all cases cleared completely within 10 days of local application of a water-soluble ointment containing 50 mg/g of pyridoxine. Other types of SD, particularly flexural and infected, did not respond to this mode of therapy. In one study of patients with elevated levels of urinary xan- thurenic acid, oral, parenteral, and local applications of pyridoxine all returned excretion levels to normal, implying transcutaneous absorption of pyridoxine.7,8 These results are clouded, however, by those of another study indicating that the improvement from topical application may be due more to a reduction in the sebaceous secre- tion rate by the ointment itself, with the added pyridoxine having no effect.9

The patient should be asked about exposure to pyridoxine anti- metabolites. Examples are the hydrazine dyes (U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act [FD&C] yellow no. 5) and drugs (isoniazid and hydral- azine), dopamine, penicillamine, oral contraceptives, and excessive protein intake.10

## Proprietary Herbal Shampoo

An open-label study of a shampoo and scalp lotion that includes botanical antifungal and anti-inflammatory agents in addition to zinc pyrithione in 50 patients with moderate to severe scalp SD showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline in erythema and loose flaking after 2 weeks. The average total severity score improved by 49% after 6 weeks of treatment. Patient satisfaction with the prod- uct was very good. The botanical formula included Phellodendron amurense bark extract, Portulaca oleracea extract, Sapindus mukorossi fruit extract, Indigofera tinctoria extract, and Rheum palmatum root extract.11

## Aloe vera

Aloe vera gel can be quite helpful when applied topically. In one dou- ble-blind trial in people with SD, the application of a 30% crude aloe emulsion cream twice a day for 4 to 6 weeks produced improvements in scaling and itching in 62% of subjects compared with improvements in only 25% of the placebo group.12

## Melaleuca alternifolia

Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil has demonstrated activity against Malassezia species, which may be of benefit in the treatment of SD. Honey and cinnamic acid have similar activity.13 A study of patients using 5% tea tree oil shampoo showed 41% improvement in severity versus 11% in the placebo group.14 Tea tree oil may be added to the patient’s favorite shampoo as a way of increasing compliance.

## Homeopathic Therapy

A 2002 study evaluated the efficacy of a homeopathic combination remedy in the control of SD and chronic dandruff. The homeopathic therapy of Kali brom 1x, Natrum brom 2x, Niccolum sulf 3x, and Natrum mur 6x (potassium bromide, sodium bromide, nickel sul- fate, and sodium chloride) was studied in a placebo crossover trial in 41 patients with SD and/or chronic dandruff. At the end of 10 weeks, all patients crossed over to the active medication under a different label for an additional 10 weeks in an open-study format. Twenty- nine patients completed the 10-week blinded portion of the study. After 10 weeks of treatment, the disease state of the patients receiv- ing active medication showed significant improvement compared with that of the patients receiving placebo (P < 0.04). Ten weeks after crossover, the placebo patients experienced improvement as well (P < 0.01).15


Although the optimal approach to treating all patients with SD is not clear at this time, effective therapy is available for most patients. In infants, alleviation of the biotin deficiency and control of the food allergies are key. For adults, using the aforementioned herbal and zinc pyrithione-based shampoo and scalp lotion, Aloe vera, and M. alterni- folia oil are the primary therapies.


The physician should detect and treat food allergens. In nursing infants, the food allergies of the mother should be considered.


• Biotin: 1 mg daily for infants16 • Vitamin A 50,000 IU daily (contraindicated in women of childbear- ing potential) • Homeopathic combination remedy once a day

## 1808SECTION 6 Diseases

of cataract formation is ultimately related to an inability to maintain normal homeostatic concentrations of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ within the lens. These abnormalities are apparently the result of decreased Na+, K+-ATPase activity,2–7 a defect usually due to free-radical damage to some of the sulfhydryl proteins in the lens, including Na+, K+-ATPase, which contains a sulfhydryl component. In cataract formation, the normal protective mechanisms are unable to prevent free-radical damage. The lens, like many other tis- sues of the body, depends on adequate levels and activities of superox- ide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH), as well as adequate levels of accessory antioxidants such as lutein, vitamins E and C, and selenium, to help prevent damage by free radicals (Fig. 219.2). The SOD, CAT, and GSH-peroxidase content in the aque- ous fluid and lenses decreases significantly with increasing lenticular nucleus hardness grading, with lenses at hardness level V having the lowest content of antioxidants.8 Individuals with higher dietary intakes of vitamin C and E, sele- nium, and carotenes (especially lutein) have a much lower risk of developing cataracts.9 Several studies have shown that various nutri- tional supplements—multiple-vitamin formulas, vitamins C and E, B vitamins (especially vitamin B 12 and folic acid), and vitamin A—also offer significant protection against both nuclear and cortical cataracts (Fig. 219.3).10–13 Studies conducted by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group and others indicate that a combination of these nutrients will likely produce better results than any single nutrient alone or even limited combinations of three or fewer nutrients in the prevention of both age-related macular degeneration and cataracts (see Chapter 195 for more information).

## Antioxidants

<!-- chunk -->

## Lutein

Lutein, the yellow-orange carotene that offers significant protec- tion against macular degeneration, also exerts protection against cataract formation.14 Like the macula, the human lens concentrates lutein. In 1992 a prospective cohort study showed that consumption of spinach (high in lutein) was inversely related to the risk of cata- racts severe enough to require extraction.15 This initial investigation was followed by three prospective studies showing that the intake of lutein was inversely associated with cataract extraction (20% to 50% risk reduction).16–18 In a double-blind intervention trial, 17 patients clinically diagnosed with age-related cataracts were randomly assigned to receive dietary supplementation with lutein (15 mg), α -tocopherol (100 mg), or placebo three times a week for up to 2 years.19 Visual per- formance (visual acuity and glare sensitivity) improved in the lutein group, whereas there was a trend toward the maintenance of visual acuity with α -tocopherol and a decrease with placebo supplemen- tation. Lutein-containing supplements were found to be effective in reducing oxidation in the aqueous humor of patients with senile cata- racts by increasing superoxide scavenging activity.20

## 1809CHAPTER 219 Senile Cataracts


A high dietary intake of vitamin C from either dietary sources or sup- plements has been shown to protect against cataract formation.10–13,21 In addition to preventing cataracts, antioxidant nutrients like vitamin C may offer some therapeutic benefits. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that vitamin C supplementation can halt cataract pro- gression and in some cases significantly improve vision. For example, in a study conducted in 1939, 450 patients with cataracts were started on a nutritional program that included 1 g/day of vitamin C, resulting in a significant reduction in cataract development.2 Similar patients had previously required surgery within 4 years, but in the vitamin C– treated patients, only a handful needed surgery, and in most, there was no evidence that the cataracts had progressed over the 11-year study period. It appears that the daily dose of vitamin C necessary to increase the vitamin C content of the lens is 1000 mg.3 The lens of the eye and active tissue of the body require higher concentrations of vitamin C. The level of vitamin C in the blood is about 0.5 mg/dL, whereas that in the adrenal and pituitary glands is 100 times that. In the liver, spleen, and lens of the eye, the vitamin C level is increased by at least a factor of 20. In order for these concentrations to be maintained, the body must generate enormous amounts of energy to pull vitamin C out of blood against this tremendous gradient. Keeping blood vitamin C con- centrations elevated helps the body concentrate vitamin C into active tissue by reducing the gradient. That is probably why such a high dose is required to raise the vitamin C content of the lens. In another study, 450 patients with incipient cataracts were started on a nutritional program including 1 g/day of vitamin C, which led to a significant reduction in cataract development.3 In a large double-blind trial, 11,545 apparently healthy U.S. male physicians 50 years or older without a diagnosis of cataracts at base- line were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU of vitamin E or pla- cebo on alternate days and 500 mg of vitamin C or placebo daily.22 After 8 years of treatment and follow-up, there was no significant difference in cataract formation in the groups. This study may have failed to show benefit because it was below the threshold of 1 g/day of vitamin C. A meta-analysis summarizing the evidence from epidemiological studies of vitamin C and the risk of age-related cataracts found that higher vitamin C intake and serum ascorbate may be inversely asso- ciated.23 The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of cataract for the highest versus the lowest category of vitamin C intake was 0.814 (0.707–0.938), and the associations were significant in America and Asia. A significant association of cataract risk with the highest versus the lowest category of serum ascorbate was found in general (0.704 [0.564–0.879]). Inverse associations were also found between serum ascorbate and nuclear cataract and posterior subcap- sular cataract.

## Glutathione

A tripeptide composed of glycine, glutamic acid, and cysteine, GSH is found at very high concentrations in the lens. GSH plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy lens and has been postulated as a key protective factor against toxins of both intralenticular and extralenticular origin. It functions as an antioxidant, maintains reduced sulfhydryl bonds within the lens proteins, acts as a coenzyme of various enzyme systems, participates in amino acid transport with gamma-glutamyl transpepti- dase, and is involved in cation transport.5 GSH levels are diminished in virtually all forms of cataracts.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ascorbic acid and glutathione interactions. The antioxidants

ascorbic acid (AA) and GSH work in close conjunction and are the most important of all the host-protective factors against the induction of cataracts. The reactions between them are as follows: AA+superoxide→dehydroascorbate+H 2 O 2 Light may also cause oxidation of AA, leading to hydrogen peroxide formation, as follows: AA+light→dehydroascorbate+H 2 O 2 An interesting cycle is then set into motion. The dehydroascorbate and hydrogen peroxide produced are reduced by selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase, as follows: 2GSH+dehydroascorbate→GSSG+AA 2GSH+H 2 O 2→ GSSG+2H 2 O The oxidized glutathione (GSSG) serves as an inducer of the hexose monophosphate shunt, which provides the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH; reduced form) necessary for reduc- ing GSSG via riboflavin-dependent glutathione reductase, as follows: GSSG+2NADPH→2GSH+2NADP The NADP is reduced by hexose monophosphate dehydrogenase, as follows: NADP+glucose−6−(P)→NADPH+ribulose5−(P)+CO 2 This combination of enzymatic and nonenzymatic scavenging of free radicals is a key mechanism for the protection of the lens from photochemical and other forms of oxidative damage.

## Selenium and Vitamin E

Selenium and vitamin E, both antioxidants, are known to function synergistically. The maintenance of proper selenium levels appears to be especially important because human lens glutathione peroxidase is selenium-dependent. Low selenium levels strongly promote cataract formation. Previous studies have shown that the selenium content in the cataractous human lens is only 15% of normal.6 A later study was conducted to better examine the role of sele- nium in cataract formation.7 Selenium levels in the serum, lens, and aqueous humor were determined in 48 patients with cataracts and compared with levels in matched controls. Selenium levels in the serum and aqueous humor were found to be significantly lower in the patients with cataracts (serum, 0.28 mg/mL; aqueous humor, 0.19 mg/mL) than in normal controls (serum, 0.32 mg/mL; aqueous humor, 0.31 mg/mL). However, the selenium level in the lens itself did not significantly differ between the patients with cataracts and the controls. The most important finding of the study was the decreased level of selenium in the aqueous humor in patients with cataracts. Excess hydrogen peroxide levels, up to 25 times normal, are found in the aqueous humor in patients with cataracts. An excess of hydrogen per- oxide is associated with higher lipid peroxidation and altered lens per- meability as a result of damage to the sodium–potassium pump. These changes ultimately leave the lens unprotected against free-radical and sun damage. As a result, a cataract is formed. Because selenium- dependent glutathione peroxidase is responsible for the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, it is obvious that low levels of selenium are a major factor in the development of a cataract. As previously described, vitamin E supplementation alone does not slow the progression of cataract formation.19 A double-blind study in which vitamin E was given at a dose of 500 IU daily also found that supplementation did not slow cataract formation.24 In a 7-year trial, supplementation with vitamin E (400 IU) combined with vitamin C (500 mg) and beta-carotene (15 mg) had no effect on the development or progression of cataracts.25 However, a meta-analy- sis indicated that dietary vitamin E intake, dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake, and high levels of serum tocopherol were signifi- cantly associated with reduced age-related cataract (ARC) risk.26 The pooled relative risk was 0.73 (95% CI 0.58, 0.92), 0.86 (95% CI 0.75, 0.99), and 0.77 (95% CI 0.66, 0.91), respectively. The findings from dose–response analysis showed evidence of a nonlinear asso- ciation between dietary vitamin E intake and ARC. The risk of ARC decreased with dietary vitamin E intake from 7 mg/d (relative risk = 0.94; 95% CI 0.90, 0.97).

## Superoxide Dismutase

The activity of SOD is lower in the human lens than in other tissues owing to the higher levels of ascorbate and glutathione in the lens, and a progressive decrease in SOD is encountered in cataract progres- sion. Oral supplementation is probably of little value because it does not affect tissue SOD activity.27 Of greater value is supplementation with the trace mineral cofactors of SOD, the levels of which are greatly reduced in the cataractous lens (copper by >90%, manganese by 50%, and zinc by >90%).28

<!-- chunk -->

## Catalase

Catalase is concentrated in the epithelial portion of the lens (anterior surface), with very low levels found in the rest of the lens. Its primary function is to reduce (to water and oxygen) the hydrogen peroxide formed from the oxidation of ascorbate.

<!-- chunk -->

## Tetrahydrobiopterin

Pteridine compounds are believed to play a protective role against cataract formation via the prevention of oxidation and damage by ultraviolet light. This action prevents the formation of high-molec- ular-weight proteins in the lens. Tetrahydrobiopterin functions as an essential coenzyme in the hydroxylation of monoamines such as phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase. Studies of human senile cataracts have demonstrated decreased levels of pteridine-synthesizing enzymes and tetrahydro- biopterin.29 Supplemental folic acid may help to compensate for this deficiency.

## Other Nutritional Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## B Vitamins

Lenticular GSH requires flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a coen- zyme for GSH.30,31 Deficiency of riboflavin, the precursor of FAD, is believed to enhance cataract formation by depressing GSH activity. Although riboflavin deficiency is fairly common in the geriatric pop- ulation (33%), original studies demonstrating an association between riboflavin deficiency and cataract formation were followed by studies demonstrating no such association. The patient’s riboflavin status can

## 1811CHAPTER 219 Senile Cataracts

be determined by measuring GSH activity in red blood cells before and after stimulation with FAD.31 Although correction of the deficiency is warranted, no more than 10 mg/day of riboflavin should be prescribed for patients with cata- racts because it is a photosensitizing substance—superoxide radicals are generated by the interaction of light, ambient oxygen, and ribo- flavin/FAD. Riboflavin and light (at physiological levels) have been used experimentally to induce cataracts. The evidence appears to sug- gest that excess riboflavin does more harm than good in patients with cataracts. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) evaluated whether the dietary intake of B vitamins is associated with cataract preva- lence and incidence.32 At baseline, increased dietary riboflavin and B 12 were inversely associated with nuclear and cortical lens opaci- ties. In comparisons of individuals with and without cataract, those with the highest riboflavin intake versus those with the lowest intake had the following associations: mild nuclear cataract—odds ratio (OR), 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63 to 0.97; moderate nuclear cataract—OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.90; and mild cortical cataract—OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99. For B 12 , the results were as follows: mild nuclear cataract—OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.96; moderate nuclear cataract—OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.88; and mild cortical cataract—OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.95. The highest dietary B 6 intake was associated with a decreased risk of the development of moderate nuclear lens opacity compared with the lowest quintile (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.99). The highest dietary intake levels of niacin and B 12 were associated with a decreased risk of the develop- ment of mild nuclear or mild cortical cataracts in participants not taking multivitamins.

## Amino Acids

Methionine is a component of the lenticular antioxidant enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase and a precursor of cysteine, a compo- nent of GSH. Cysteine, along with the other amino acid precursors of GSH, has been shown to be of some aid in cataract treatment.33

<!-- chunk -->

## Zinc, Vitamin A, and Beta-Carotene

The antioxidants zinc, vitamin A, and beta-carotene are known to be essential to normal epithelial integrity. Adequate amounts of these nutrients are vitally important to the health of the epithelial portion of the lens. In particular, beta-carotene may act as a filter, protecting against light-induced damage to the fibrous portion of the lens. Beta- carotene is the most significant of the singlet oxygen free-radical scav- engers and is used in treating photosensitive disorders.34 However, in long-term studies, beta-carotene supplementation (50 mg on alternate days) on its own has been found to have no impact on cataract preven- tion in either women or men.35,36

## Melatonin

Melatonin is a very efficient free-radical scavenger and antioxidant that can neutralize hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals as well as enhance endogenous and exogenous antioxidant efficiency. In animal mod- els, melatonin has been an effective inhibitor of DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and cataract formation. Melatonin is present at signifi- cant levels in the cell nucleus, aqueous cytosol, and lipid-rich cellular membranes.37

<!-- chunk -->

## Multivitamin/Mineral

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of multivitamin/mineral supplements for decreasing the risk of age-related cataracts.38 Twelve prospective cohort studies and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Pooled results from the cohort studies indicated that multivitamin/mineral supplements have a significant beneficial effect in decreasing the risk of nuclear cataracts (RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.64–0.82), cortical cataracts (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68–0.94), and any cataracts (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.39–0.93). In addition, there were no decreases in the risk of poste- rior capsular cataracts (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.72–1.20) or cataract sur- gery (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.92–1.08). The two RCTs demonstrated that multivitamin/mineral supplements could decrease the risk of nuclear cataracts.

## Curcumin

Curcumin has been widely exploited due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research indicates curcumin has several anti- cataract mechanisms. Curcumin inhibits lens membrane lipid perox- idation, supplements as well as induces the expression of antioxidant enzymes, maintains lens calcium homeostasis, aids lens chaperone proteins, regulates transcription factors, and modulates the levels of enzyme systems in the lens that are associated with disease conditions leading to cataract (Fig. 219.4).39

<!-- chunk -->

## Lanosterol

Lanosterol is an amphipathic molecule enriched in the lens synthe- sized by lanosterol synthase. The genetic roots of severe cataracts have been traced to a mutation of the gene that encodes lanosterol synthase. Treating cells that express disordered crystallin proteins with lanos- terol significantly decreased preformed protein aggregates in vitro and in cell-transfection experiments, resulting in solubilization of the cat- aracts.40 A nanoparticle preparation of lanosterol when applied as eye drops to one eye of a dog with bilateral cataracts for 6 weeks led to a marked dissolution of that cataract, suggesting that dietary-derived small molecules may not only reduce the risk of lens cataracts but may even be used in the therapeutic reversal of cataracts. Human studies are needed to verify this encouraging potential treatment.

## Dairy Products

Cataracts often develop in infants with a homozygous deficiency of either galactokinase or galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase and in laboratory animals fed a high-galactose diet. Abnormalities of galac- tose metabolism can be identified by measurements of the activity of these enzymes in red blood cells. It has been suggested that such abnormalities are an important mechanism in approximately 30% of cataracts.31 However, this mechanism of cataract formation appears to be significant only in diabetic cataract formation and is probably not relevant to senile cataract formation (for further discussion, see Chapter 165).

<!-- chunk -->

## Toxic Metals

Several toxic metals have been shown to have higher concentrations in both the aging lens and the cataractous lens. Although the levels are higher in the latter, the significance of this finding is unknown.28 The cadmium concentration is two to three times higher in cat- aractous lenses than in lenses of age-matched controls. Because cad- mium displaces zinc from binding in enzymatic proteins by binding to the sulfhydryl groups, it may contribute to deactivation of free-radical quenching and other protective/repair mechanisms. Cadmium is a common component of cigarette smoke, which, along with free-radical formation, may be the reason cigarette smoking is asso- ciated with lens opacities. Moreover, levels of nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide, are markedly increased by cigarette smoking and have been found in higher concentration in human cataractous lenses.41 Other elevated elements of unknown significance are bromine, cobalt, iridium, and nickel.28

## Flavonoid-Rich Extracts

Several excellent choices from the botanical world are available to help with antioxidant mechanisms. Among the best may be flavonoid-rich extracts from Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vitis vinifera (grape seed), and Pinus maritima (pine bark). The occurrence of cataracts in rats can be retarded by changing their diet from a commercial labora- tory chow to a “well-defined diet.”42 Preliminary research suggests that flavonoid components in the well-defined diets may be responsible for the protective effects.43 Of the flavonoid-rich extracts, bilberry anthocyanosides may offer the greatest protection. In one human study, bilberry extract plus vitamin E stopped the progression of cataract formation in 97% of patients with senile cortical cataracts.44

<!-- chunk -->

## Hachimijiogan

An ancient Chinese herbal formula, Hachimijiogan, has been shown to raise the antioxidant level of the lens of the eye.45 This activity may explain its use in the treatment of cataracts for hundreds of years. According to clinical research, its therapeutic effect is quite impres- sive in the early stages of cataract formation. In one study, 60% of the subjects receiving Hachimijiogan noted significant improvement, 20% of the group showed no progression, and only the remaining 20% dis- played progression. Hachimijiogan contains the following eight herbs (per 24 g): • Rehmania glutinosa: 6000 mg • Poria cocos sclerotium: 3000 mg • Dioscorea opposita: 3000 mg • Cormus officinalis: 3000 mg • Epimedium grandiflorum: 3000 mg • Alisma plantago: 3000 mg • Astragalus membranaceus: 2000 mg • Cinnamonum cassia: 1000 mg


In cases of marked visual impairment, cataract removal and lens implan- tation may be the only alternative. As with most diseases, prevention or treatment at an early stage is most effective. Free-radical damage appears to be the primary factor in the induction of senile cataracts, so avoid- ance of oxidizing agents and the promotion of free-radical scavenging are critical to successful treatment. The patient should avoid direct ultraviolet light, bright light, and photosensitizing substances; wear protective lenses when outdoors; and greatly increase intake of antioxi- dant nutrients. Progression of the pathological process can be stopped, and early lesions can be reversed. However, significant reversal of well- developed cataracts does not appear to be possible at this time. Because the geriatric population is especially susceptible to nutrient deficiencies, every effort should be made to ensure that the patient is ingesting and assimilating adequate macronutrients and micronutrients.

## 1815CHAPTER 220 Streptococcal Pharyngitis

Antibiotics are often praised for their role in effectively eliminating rheumatic fever as a serious concern. However, the dramatic decrease in the incidence of rheumatic fever began before the advent of effec- tive antibiotics.10 Similar to the eradication of most infectious diseases, improvements in socioeconomic, hygienic, and nutritional conditions have contributed significantly more than the liberal use of antibiot- ics. The present attack rates after a streptococcal infection are 0.4% to 2.8% for rheumatic fever and 0.2% to 20% for glomerulonephritis. Such a wide range of reported sequelae makes accurate evaluation of the risk difficult.


The primary therapeutic consideration is the status of the patient’s immune system. If the patient’s immune system is functioning well, the illness will be short-lived. Enhancing general immune function, as described in Chapter 136, may shorten the course. In cases of poor immune function, every effort should be made to strengthen the immune system by following the recommendations given in that chapter.


During the 1930s there was considerable interest in the relationship between malnutrition and the development of the sequelae of strepto- coccal pharyngitis. Both experimental animal work and epidemiological surveys demonstrated a correlation between vitamin C deficiency and the development of sequelae. Rheumatic fever is virtually nonexistent in the tropics, where vitamin C intake is higher. Elsewhere, as many as 18% of children in high-risk groups have subnormal serum levels of vitamin C. When streptococcus-infected, vitamin C–deficient, rheumatic fever– susceptible guinea pigs are supplemented with vitamin C, the development of rheumatic fever is totally prevented.11,12 Uncontrolled clinical studies have demonstrated very positive results when children were given orange juice supplementation. Unfortunately, this promising line of research appears to have been dropped, probably owing to the advent of antibiotics.

## Hydrastis canadensis and Echinacea Species

Hydrastis canadensis and Echinacea species are well respected as supports for the immune system during GABHS infections. The berberine alkaloid of Hydrastis exerts antibiotic activity against streptococci and, perhaps more importantly, has been shown to inhibit the attachment of group A streptococci to pharyngeal epi- thelial cells. Echinacea also exerts action against streptococcal infec- tion. To promote the spread of colonies, streptococci secrete large amounts of hyaluronidase. This enzyme is inhibited by Echinacea as well as by many bioflavonoids. Echinacea also inactivates group A streptococci and reduces the proinflammatory response to strep infection as well as promoting greater phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity, and properdin levels.13 See Chapters 75 and 86 for fur- ther discussion.

## Pelargonium sidoides (South African Geranium)

Extracts from the rhizomes and tubers of Pelargonium sidoides have been shown to exert several effects that are beneficial in upper respi- ratory tract infections, and such extracts are an approved drug in Germany for the treatment of acute bronchitis (see Chapter 155). P. sidoides has demonstrated immune-enhancing effects as well as antibacterial effects and the ability to prevent adhesion of bacteria to epithelial cells.14 In a double-blind study, an extract of P. sidoides (EPs 7630) was shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children.15 A total of 143 children, aged 6 to 10 years, with non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis were given either EPs 7630 or placebo (20 drops three times daily) for 6 days. The decrease in the Tonsillopharyngitis Severity Score from baseline (day 0) to day 4 was 7.1 points with EPs 7630 and 2.5 points in the placebo group. Treatment with EPs 7630 reduced the severity of symptoms and shortened the duration of illness by at least 2 days, consistent with the results seen in acute bronchitis. Although this study was in non- GABHS, it does raise the possibility that P. sidoides may have benefit in GABHS. Any of the following signs and symptoms: 1. Tonsillar exudate 2.

## Bacteriotherapy

Colonizing the throat with group A non–beta-hemolytic streptococci may prove to be an effective treatment for recurrent group A beta-he- molytic streptococcal pharyngitis. In a double-blind study, 130 patients with recurrence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngot- onsillitis received antibiotic treatment for 10 days, followed by 10 days of spray treatment with either placebo or group A non–beta-hemo- lytic streptococcal alpha-streptococci.16 The clinical recurrences (bac- teriologically verified) in the alpha-streptococci- and placebo-treated patient groups were 2% and 23%, respectively, in patients given spray for at least 5 days. No side effects were reported. In another double-blind study, a total of 342 patients with verified GABHS pharyngitis by the rapid strep test and culture received antibi- otic treatment for 10 days, followed by 10 days of alpha-streptococcal or placebo spray treatment.17 Pharyngeal status, throat culture, and adverse events were investigated up to 75 days after treatment. The fre- quencies of bacteriologically verified clinical recurrence at the last valid visit after 45 to 75 days were 19% and 30%, respectively—a statistically significant difference. Recolonization with alpha-streptococci seemed to hinder late recurrences of GABHS pharyngotonsillitis.


Streptococcus salivarius K12 (BLIS K12) is a probiotic strain producing the bacteriocins salivaricin A2 and salivaricin B, both of which strongly antagonize the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bac- terial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans. It successfully colonizes and exhibits persistence in the oral cavity, is endowed with an excellent safety profile, and reduces the occurrence of streptococcal and viral pharyngitis. A potential basis for this effect has been shown, whereby the administration of BLIS K12 in adults can increase salivary γ -interferon levels without modifying the levels of either interleukin (IL)-1 β or tumor necrosis factor- α but considerably reducing IL-8 release.18 Several studies have confirmed the benefits of S. salivarius. A ret- rospective analysis of pediatric subjects with nonrecurrent streptococ- cal infection demonstrated that K12 use decreased the incidence of pharyngo-tonsillitis by about 90%.19 The role of BLIS K12 was evaluated in the control of streptococcal disease and acute otitis media in chil- dren attending the first year of kindergarten.20 By randomization, enrolled children attending the first year of kindergarten were divided into a treated group (N = 111) receiving a daily treatment with BLIS K12 (Bactoblis) for 6 months and a control group (N = 111) that was mon- itored as untreated controls. During the 6-month trial, the incidence of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis, scarlet fever, and acute otitis media was approximately 16%, 9%, and 44%, respectively, in the treated group and 48%, 4%, and 80% in the control group. During the 3-month fol- low-up, the corresponding rates of infection were 15%, 0%, and 12% in the treated group and 26%, 6%, and 36% in the controls. Prophylactic administration of S. salivarius K12 to children with a history of recur- rent oral streptococcal disease resulted in a considerable reduction of episodes of both streptococcal and viral infections, reduced the number of days under antibiotic and/or antipyretic therapy, and reduced days of absence from school or work.21 The benefits to children may also extend to a reduction of nonstreptococcal diseases, including tracheitis, viral pharyngitis, rhinitis, flu, laryngitis, acute otitis media, and enteritis.22 In adults with a history of recurrent oral streptococcal pathology, prophy- lactic administration of S. salivarius K12 reduced the number of episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infections and/or tonsillitis by 80%, with an approximately 60% reduction in the incidence of reported pharyngitis in the 6-month period following use of the product.23

## Lactoferrin

Low concentrations of bovine lactoferrin have significantly hindered the in vitro invasion of cultured epithelial cells by group A strep- tococci isolated from patients with pharyngitis. The ability of lac- toferrin to decrease streptococcal invasion was confirmed in a trial carried out in 12 children with pharyngitis and already scheduled for tonsillectomy. A lower number of intracellular group A strep- tococci were found in tonsil specimens from children treated for days before tonsillectomy with both oral erythromycin (500 mg three times daily) and lactoferrin gargles (100 mg three times daily) than in those from children treated with erythromycin alone (500 mg three times daily).24


For further information, consult Chapter 136. If antibiotics are used, follow the recommendations for supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus given in Chapter 105.


• Vitamin C: 500 mg every 2 hours • Bioflavonoids: 1000 mg/day • Zinc: 30 mg/day


Echinacea species • Dried root (or as tea): 0.5 to 1 g/day • Freeze-dried plant: 325 to 650 mg/day • Juice of aerial portion of Echinacea purpurea stabilized in 22% eth- anol: 2 to 3 mL/day • Tincture (1:5): 2 to 4 mL (0.5 to 1 tsp)/day • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (0.5 to 1 tsp)/day • Solid (dry powdered) extract (6.5:1 or 3.5% echinacoside): 150 to 300 mg/day Hydrastis canadensis The dosage of H. canadensis should be based on berberine content. Because there is a wide range of quality in goldenseal preparations, standardized extracts are recommended. • Dried root or as infusion (tea): 2 to 4 g three times a day • Tincture (1:5): 6 to 12 mL (1.5 to 3 tsp) three times a day • Fluid extract (1:1): 2 to 4 mL (0.5 to 1 tsp) three times a day • Solid (powdered dry) extract (4:1 or 8% to 12% alkaloid content): 250 to 500 mg three times a day Pelargonium sidoides Dosage recommendations for EPs 7630 or equivalent preparation: Adults: 1.5 mL three times a day or a 20-mg tablet three times a day for up to 14 days Children: age 7 to 12 years, 20 drops (1 mL) three times a day; age years or less, 10 drops (0.5 mL) three times a day

(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), a nucleic acid probe test that evaluates for trichomonal vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida albicans.5 Both of these tests are performed on vaginal secretions and have a sensitivity of greater than 83% and a speci- ficity of greater than 97%. The results of the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test are available in about 10 minutes, and the results of the Affirm VP III are available within 45 minutes. These tests tend to greatly assist physicians in the accurate and timely diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

## Trichomonal Vaginitis

Sexual transmission is the clear route of Trichomonas infection. Prevalence is highest among women with multiple sex partners and in those with other sexually transmitted infections. Transmission rates from men to women seem to be high—an 80% to 100% prev- alence rate is found in the female partners of infected men.3 In the female, T. vaginalis usually infests the vagina and urethra. However, infection may involve the endocervix, Bartholin glands, Skene glands, or bladder. The vagina appears to be a good reservoir for the organism. Under the stimulation of estrogen, the vaginal walls are well glycogenated—essential for T. vaginalis to thrive. Prepubescent and postmenopausal women seldom have symptomatic trichomonal infections. In addition to estrogen, an elevated pH increases susceptibility to Trichomonas. The normal adult vagina maintains a pH of 3.5 to 4.5 owing to the metabolism of free glucose into lactic acid by vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus. A decrease in the number of lactobacilli raises the pH. Trichomonas organisms grow optimally at a vaginal pH of 5.5 to 5.8. Other conditions that increase vaginal pH include the following: • An increase in progesterone, which rises in the latter half of the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy • Excess intravaginal secretions (i.e., cervical mucus) • Overgrowth of certain bacteria, such as Streptococcus and Proteus

## Trichomonas in the Male

Although the incidence is lower in men, 5% to 15% of cases of non- gonococcal urethritis are estimated to be caused by trichomonal infections.1,2 The estimated transmission rate is 70% for men who have had sexual contact with infected women in the previous hours.2 Men with T. vaginalis are most often asymptomatic, yet mild cases of urethritis, prostatitis, and epididymitis have been reported. As might be expected, trichomoniasis is a factor in male infertility.4 Trichomonads have been identified in semen, urethral discharge, urine, and prostatic fluid and have been found in the prostatic secretions and semen in up to 23% of men with chronic nongono- coccal prostatitis.6 In several independent studies, a history of trichomoniasis, as mea- sured by serum antibodies against T. vaginalis α -actinin protein, was found to be associated with increased prostate cancer risk. Preliminary reports indicate that T. vaginalis adherence or binding of specific trichomonad adhesin proteins to normal prostate epithelial cells trig- gers a cell-signaling cascade through known proto-oncogenes, PIM1, c-MYC, and HMGA1, which may ultimately lead to prostate carcino- genesis (Fig. 221.2).7 Although men were thought to be only vectors for Trichomonas, the parasite is now known to persist in the male reproductive tract. The reinfection of treated females who are sexually active is well doc- umented.4 Therefore treatment of both sex partners is necessary. Furthermore, among both women and men, the association of T. vag- inalis with enhanced HIV acquisition and transmission has been well documented.2

## Conventional Treatment

Conventional therapy of trichomoniasis involves metronidazole and tinidazole, a second-generation nitroimidazole used to treat metroni- dazole-resistant infection.6 Randomized controlled trials comparing tinidazole (2-g single oral dose) and either metronidazole (2-g single oral dose) or short-course metronidazole have demonstrated parasito- logical cure rates of 86% to 100% for all treatments, although tinida- zole is slightly more effective but also more expensive. In a Cochrane Database meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing short-course therapy with tinidazole and short-course therapy with metronidazole for trichomoniasis, metronidazole had significantly higher rates of par- asitological failure, clinical failure, and adverse effects.8 Again, in order to reduce recurrence rates, sex partners should be treated at the same time. Common side effects of metronidazole and tinidazole are nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, and gastrointestinal upset. With long-term high-dose use, rare occurrences of peripheral neuropathy have been reported. If metronidazole or tinidazole treatment is chosen, probiotic sup- plementation should also be included. In the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, the administration of vaginal insertion with L. acidophilus has led to cure rates superior to those with metronidazole.9,10 This sug- gests some benefit in vaginal trichomoniasis, given the frequent dis- ruption of proper vaginal flora in these women.

## 1819CHAPTER 221 Trichomoniasis


Dietary factors affect the body’s ability to defend itself against foreign invaders and substances both directly and indirectly. As with any infec- tion, it is not the pathogenicity of the organism but rather the “fertility of the soil” that allows the organism to grow and flourish. A well-bal- anced diet high in natural fiber (vegetable, fruits) and low in fat, sugar, and refined carbohydrates aids immune function (see Chapter 136 for more discussion) and may discourage any concomitant overgrowth of Candida.

<!-- chunk -->

## Lifestyle

Depression and anxiety have been associated with exacerbations of trichomonal infections. Therefore efforts to reduce stress are indicated. Reduction may be achieved by a variety of means, including exercise and meditation. The practice of safe sex or abstinence (during infection) also lowers the incidence of infection and reinfection.


In addition to the basic supplements for immune support described in Chapter 136, zinc supplementation appears to be an important consideration in the treatment of trichomonal infections in both men and women. The antimicrobial spectrum of zinc is broad and com- prises many potential genitourinary pathogens, including T. vaginalis as well as C. albicans and Chlamydia trachomatis and many viruses.11 Trichomonads are readily killed by zinc at a concentration of 0.042% (6.4 mmol/L), a concentration that can occur in the prostatic fluid of men. The zinc concentration of prostatic fluid ranges from 0.015% to 0.10% (2.3–15.3 mmol/L).11 This finding suggests that persistent trichomonal infections in men may be due to a low-level zinc defi- ciency. Zinc sulfate (220 mg twice daily for 3 weeks) has been recom- mended as a possible treatment for trichomonal infections that are refractory to metronidazole.12 For women with drug-resistant trichomoniasis, zinc douches in combination with metronidazole may provide welcome relief. In a small study, the women with recalcitrant trichomoniasis (4 months to 4 years culture-positive despite conventional treatment) all became culture-negative using a combination of 1% zinc sulfate douching (for 3 days after each menstrual period) and 1.6 to 2.2 g/day of metronida- zole (suppositories plus oral administration).13

## Povidone-Iodine

Iodine has long been recognized as a highly potent trichomonacide. Povidone-iodine (PVP) has a broad therapeutic effect in killing many different microorganisms that cause vaginitis, including T. vagina- lis.14,15 PVP (iodine, which is absorbed into polyvinyl pyrrolidine) has several advantages over iodine in that it has little sensitizing potential, does not sting, is water-soluble, and washes out of clothing. A success rate of 98.1% has been reported in patients with intrac- table trichomonal, monilial, nonspecific, and mixed vaginitis for a 2-week treatment regimen using PVP (Betadine) preparations.16,17 Other studies suggest a 28-day course of povidone-iodine pessaries, particularly if the patient is using oral contraceptives.18

## Propolis

An ethanol extract of propolis (150 mg/mL) has been shown to have a 100% lethal effect in vitro on the protozoans T. vaginalis and Toxoplasma gondii after 24 hours of contact.19 This extract has also been shown to diminish the inflammation associated with trichomonal vaginitis.

## Essential Oils

The diverse antimicrobial action of essential oils has been well demon- strated. Many possess strong antitrichomonal properties. In a study of 40 essential oils tested for their ability to kill Trichomonas, Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) had the fastest killing effects (20 and 15 minutes, respectively).20

M. alternifolia (tea tree) oil is a powerful antimicrobial agent (see Chapter 91). Commonly used as a germicidal agent in Great Britain and Australia, a 40% solution of tea tree oil has been found to be a highly effective treatment.21 The 40% solution of the oil produced no

## Berberine-Containing Botanicals

The plant alkaloid berberine sulfate has been shown in vitro to inhibit the growth of several protozoa, including Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and T. vaginalis.23,24 No clinical trials of this agent have been reported in trichomonas vaginalis (see Chapter 86 for fur- ther discussion).


Given the risk of serious sequelae of trichomoniasis and the high success rate of conventional pharmaceutical intervention, systemic metronidazole should be carefully considered as a possible first-line treatment, along with simultaneous and subsequent naturopathic therapies to decrease the risk of future recurrence and to treat some of the contributing underlying susceptibilities. Naturopathic therapies may be used as first-line therapy in patients who are allergic to met- ronidazole or are pregnant. The use of metronidazole in pregnancy remains somewhat controversial in spite of its apparent lack of tera- togenic action. Despite the role of T. vaginalis in perinatal morbidity, metronidazole treatment may increase the risk of preterm birth.25,26 Discussion with the patient of such factors as diet, sexual habits, and lifestyle is recommended. The clinician should inform the patient that Trichomonas infection is a sexually transmitted disease and that treat- ment of the sex partners is necessary to prevent reinfection. During the treatment, sexual intercourse should be avoided. If intercourse does occur, a condom must be used.


The patient should decrease the consumption of refined carbohy- drates, alcohol, and fats and increase the intake of fiber.

later) that have been found, yet the pathogenesis cannot be entirely ascribed to any one mechanism. The spinothalamic tract is thought to play an important role in the pathway of pruritus.9 Primary afferent neurons, also known as pruriceptors, detect itch-inducing substances like histamine and chloroquine. The most well-known pruritogen is histamine; however, nonhistaminergic mediators also exist. Initially it was thought that the nerve fibers only responded to histamine/non- histamine stimulus, but it is now accepted that these fibers can also be stimulated by noxious stimuli. Acute urticaria has identified precipitating factors in <50% of cases. When present, the most common triggers are upper respiratory infec- tions (40%), drug reactions (9.2%), and food intolerance (0.9%).10 Chronic urticaria may be subclassified into chronic spontaneous urticaria or chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU). Up to 30% of cases are associated with functional immunoglobulin (Ig)-G antibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc ε RI α or to IgA. Among patients in which an etiology is suspected, infections, drugs, food, and psycholog- ical factors are the most commonly associated (Fig. 222.2). CIndU is recognized by its ability to be triggered consistently and reproducibly in response to a specific stimulus. Mast cells, mast cell–dependent mediators, and basophils play the most prominent role in the pathogenesis of urticaria.11,12 Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body and are found primarily near small blood vessels, particularly in the skin. The granule-containing mast cell is a secretory cell capable of releasing both preformed and newly syn- thesized mediators (listed in Box 222.1) that play key roles in the patho- genesis of both immunological and nonimmunological inflammatory reactions. The three distinct sources of mediators are as follows: • Preformed mediators, which are contained in the granules and are released immediately • Secondarily formed mediators, which are generated immediately or within minutes by the interaction of the primary mediators and nearby cells and tissues • Granule matrix–derived mediators, which are preformed but slowly dissociate from the granule after discharge and remain in the tissues for hours Dermatographism Cholinergic Cold induced Solar Aquagenic Exercise Delayed-pressure Urticaria < 48 hours*> 48 hours* Urticarial vasculitis > 6 weeks*

## 1823CHAPTER 222 Urticaria

The most common immunological mechanism is mediated by IgE. The early vascular changes appear to be the result of mast cell– dependent vasoactive mediators, particularly histamine and some secondarily generated end products of arachidonic acid metabolism (prostaglandins). The wheal-and-flare reactions occur within minutes of initiation and last 30 to 60 minutes. Histamine and other mediators can be released by other nonal- lergic mechanisms as well. Neuropeptides are known to cause mast cell degranulation and may well be involved in dermographism and emotional exacerbation of urticaria. The more prolonged and delayed reactions reflect leukocytic infiltration in response to the release of mast cell granule–derived chemotactic factors. These late-phase reac- tions develop over time and are characterized by erythema, edema, and induration beginning within 2 hours and lasting 12 to 24 hours. Leukocyte infiltration may contribute to the urticarial tissue response by inducing a second wave of mast cell activation or by releasing toxic lysosomal enzymes and mediators characteristic of the type of infil- trating cell. The actual events initiated by the mediators also depend on the tis- sues into which they are released. For example, the release of histamine into the skin primarily produces pruritus and vascular permeability, whereas histamine release into the lungs may induce bronchospasm. Prostaglandin release, rather than histamine mediation, seems to be involved in contact urticaria. Helicobacter pylori has been implicated as a causative agent in chronic urticaria, and a protein component has been shown to induce mast cell degranulation.13,14 However, two reviews of the trials showing the benefit of H. pylori eradication in patients with chronic urticaria have arrived at conflict- ing conclusions, with one saying the benefit is weak and another that it is statistically significant.15,16 Including testing for H. pylori seems reasonable; if positive, a decision to proceed with this management should be considered carefully in the context of relative harms/bur- dens and benefits as well as patient values and preferences.17

# CAUSES OF URTICARIA

Fundamental to the treatment of urticaria are the recognition and con- trol of causative factors.

<!-- chunk -->

## Physical Urticarias

Urticaria can be produced as a result of reactions to various physi- cal stimuli. The most common forms of physical urticarias are der- mographic, cholinergic, and cold urticarias (Table 222.1). These are briefly described here. Less common types of physical urticarias or angioedema are as follows6: • Contact • Solar • Pressure • Heat contact • Aquagenic • Vibratory • Exercise-induced (a subtype of cholinergic)

<!-- chunk -->

## Dermographism

Dermographism or dermatographic urticaria is a readily elicited wheal of the skin that evolves rapidly when moderate amounts of pressure are applied. It may occur as a result of simple contact with furniture, garters, bracelets, watch bands, towels, or bedding. The incidence of dermographic urticaria has been estimated at 2% to 5% in the general population.18 The most common type of physical urticaria, it is found twice as frequently in women as in men, with the average age at onset being in the third decade. The incidence is much greater among the obese, especially those who wear tight clothing. There are several inexpensive instruments for determining provocation thresholds in patients with symptomatic dermographism.19,20 Dermographic lesions usually start within 1 to 2 minutes of con- tact as an erythema, which is replaced within 3 to 5 minutes by edema and surrounding reflex urticaria. Maximal edema is usually produced within 10 to 15 minutes. Although the erythema generally regresses within an hour, the edema can persist for up to 3 hours. Dermographism may be associated with other diseases, including the following6: • Parasitosis • Insect bites • Neuropsychiatric disorders • Hormonal changes • Thyroid disorders • Pregnancy • Menopause • Diabetes • Immunological alterations • Other urticarias • During or following drug therapy • Infection with Candida albicans • Angioedema • Hypereosinophilia

sweat gland via cholinergic afferent fibers, consist of pinpoint wheals surrounded by reflex erythema. The wheals arise at or between follicles and develop preferentially on the upper trunk and arms. The three basic types of stimuli that may produce cholinergic urti- caria are passive overheating, physical exercise, and emotional stress. Typical eliciting activities, in addition to physical exercise, may include taking a warm bath or sauna, eating hot spices, and drinking alcoholic beverages. The lesions usually arise within 2 to 10 minutes after provo- cation and last for 30 to 50 minutes. A variety of systemic symptoms may also occur, suggesting a more generalized mast cell release of the mediators than in the skin. Headache, periorbital edema, lacrimation, and burning of the eyes are common symptoms. Less common symptoms are nausea, vomit- ing, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, hypotension, and asthma attacks.6

<!-- chunk -->

## Cold Urticaria

Cold urticaria is an urticarial and/or angio-edematous reaction of the skin that develops after contact with cold objects, water, or air. Lesions are usually restricted to the area of exposure and develop within a few seconds to minutes after the removal of the cold object and rewarming of the skin. The lower the object’s or element’s temperature, the faster the reaction. Children with cold urticaria have a higher risk of anaphy- laxis, especially triggered by swimming.21 Widespread local exposure and generalized urticaria can be accom- panied by the following symptoms: • Flushing • Headaches • Chills • Dizziness • Tachycardia • Abdominal pain • Nausea • Vomiting • Muscle pain • Shortness of breath • Wheezing • Unconsciousness Cold urticaria has been observed to accompany a variety of clinical conditions, including the following22: • Viral infections • Parasitical infestations • Syphilis • Multiple insect bites • Penicillin injections • Dietary changes • Stress The association of cold urticaria with infectious mononucleosis is well established. Other conditions associated with cold urticaria are cryoglobulinemia and myeloma, in which cold urticaria may precede the diagnosis by several years.6 Cold urticaria is often found in patients with other chronic inducible urticarias (e.g., physical urticaria) as well as other allergic diseases.23

## Autoimmune Urticaria

Although much remains unknown regarding the specific pathophys- iological mechanisms underlying most cases of chronic urticaria, some seem to have an autoimmune basis. Research has discovered that a significant percentage of patients previously categorized as hav- ing chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) have autoantibodies to IgE or the Fc ε RI α subunit of the high-affinity IgE mast cell receptor (Fig. 222.3).24 Studies have identified these autoantibodies in 24% to 76% of patients with chronic urticaria. From a clinical perspective, these patients tend to have a somewhat more severe, prolonged course of disease. Middle-aged women are disproportionately represented in the population of patients with urticaria, and higher rates of autoimmu- nity in this group, particularly for thyroid disease, may account for this preponderance. Thyroid autoantibodies are found more frequently in patients with these IgE-receptor autoantibodies (see later discus- sion of thyroid). However, investigations have revealed that epitopic

cross-reactivity does not explain the higher prevalence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) in patients with CIU. The frequent concurrence of HT and CIU most likely is due to a genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease.25 One third to half of patients with CSU show a positive response against their own serum (positive autologous serum skin test [ASST]). The ASST is the most generally available test to screen for autoanti- bodies against either IgE or Fc ε RI α . These patients may need higher doses of antihistamines or additional immunomodulators. Thus the ASST is a useful tool in patients who are not responding to traditional therapy.26 Autoimmune diseases are well known to be associated with bowel permeabilities.27–30 Because subclinical impairments of small bowel enterocyte function have been postulated to induce a higher sensitivity to histamine in the digestive tract,31 it makes sense from a naturopathic standpoint to treat overt and subclinical digestive system permeabil- ities to decrease systemic inflammatory responses to endotoxins in these autoimmune conditions.

## Drugs

Drugs are the leading cause of urticarial reactions in adults. In children, the reactions are usually due to foods, food additives, or infections.6 Most drugs are composed of small molecules incapable of inducing anti- genic/allergenic activity on their own. Typically, they act as haptens that bind to endogenous macromolecules, ultimately causing the production of hap- ten-specific antibodies. Alternatively, drugs can interact directly with mast cells to induce degranulation. Many drugs have been shown to produce urticaria. Box 222.2 provides a condensed list.32 The three most common urticaria-inducing drugs, penicillin, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are briefly discussed here.

<!-- chunk -->

## Penicillin

Antibiotics, including penicillin and related compounds, are the most common cause of drug-induced urticaria. The allergenicity of penicil- lin in the general population is thought to be at least 10%. Nearly 25% of these individuals display urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis on ingestion of penicillin.6,33 An important characteristic of penicillin is that it cannot be destroyed by boiling or steam distillation. This is a problem because penicillin and related contaminants can exist undetected in foods. To what degree penicillin in the food supply contributes to urticarial reac- tions is not known. However, urticaria and anaphylactic symptoms have been traced to penicillin in milk,34 soft drinks,35 and frozen din- ners.36 In one study of 245 patients with chronic urticaria, 24% had positive skin test results, and 12% had positive results on the radio- allergosorbent test for penicillin sensitivity.37 Of those 42 patients sensitive to penicillin, 22 experienced clinical improvement with a dairy-free diet, whereas only 2 out of 40 patients with negative skin test results experienced improvement with the same diet.

provides indirect evidence of the importance of penicillin in the food supply in urticaria. To provide direct evidence, penicillin-contaminated pork was given to penicillin-allergic volunteers. No significant reactions were noted other than transient pruritus in two volunteers.38 Penicillin in milk appears to be more allergenic than penicillin in meat.34 Presumably, the reason is that penicillin can be degraded into more allergenic compounds in the presence of carbohydrate and metals, suggesting that penicillin in milk may be more allergenic than artificially contaminated meat.34

## Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Urticaria is a more common indicator of aspirin sensitivity than is asthma (see Chapter 148). The incidence of aspirin sensitivity in patients with chronic urticaria is at least 20 times greater than that in normal con- trols.39–43 Studies (summarized in Table 222.2)44–73 have demonstrated that 2% to 67% of patients with chronic urticaria are sensitive to aspirin. Aspirin inhibition of cyclooxygenase apparently shunts eicosanoid metabolism toward leukotriene synthesis, thereby increasing smooth muscle contraction and vascular permeability. In addition, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to increase gut permeability dramatically and may alter the nor- mal handling of antigens.69,74 NSAIDs are also known to be associated with prolonged and more pronounced autoreactivity in urticaria.73 The daily administration of 650 mg of aspirin for 3 weeks has been shown to desensitize patients with urticaria and aspirin sensitivity. While taking the aspirin, patients also became nonresponsive to foods to which they usually reacted, such as pineapple, milk, egg, cheese, fish, chocolate, pork, strawberries, and plums.75 Others have noted this effect in patients with asthma, but they have also found that the effect disappears within 9 days after the treatment is stopped, suggesting the loss of effect or a possible placebo response.76

## Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors are the other most commonly implicated drugs in chronic urticaria, due to the nonimmunological accumulation of bradykinin and other neurokinins. Chronic urticaria can occur from weeks to years after treatment is initiated.77

## Environmental Toxicants

Exogenous toxins are comprised of toxic agents that arise from external factors. Sources are primarily environmental and include metals, chem- icals (inorganic, fluoride, organic, persistent organic pollutants [POPs], drugs, etc.), molds, and particulate matter. The skin can eliminate toxic metals and chemical xenobiotics through perspiration, which may lead to urticarial eruptions. More commonly, reactions to exogenous toxins occur from topical exposure and can range from contact dermatitis to urticaria. Nickel is the most common allergen found by patch testing, and contact urticaria (CU) to nickel (immediate reaction) has been reported. Patients with nickel allergy often report reactions to such objects as jewelry (e.g., earrings, necklaces, bracelets, watches), buttons on clothing, and belt buckles within minutes to hours of exposure. Ambient air pollution exposure has been associated with several health conditions, limited not only to respiratory and cardiovascular systems but also to cutaneous tissues. The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) was developed in Canada and is based on the combined effects of three ambient air pollutants, ozone (O ₃ ), nitrogen dioxide (NO ₂ ),

One Canadian study examined the associations of short-term changes in the AQHI with emergency department (ED) visits for urticaria in Windsor-area hos- pitals and found positive and significant results between AQHI levels and odds ratio for ED visits for urticaria for lags of 2 and 3 days.78 Topical insect repellants, such as N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), can produce contact urticaria from direct application as well as from con- tact with individuals who have used DEET-containing repellents.79

## Food-Related Causes

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Allergy

IgE-mediated urticaria can occur with the ingestion of a specific reac- tive antigens. Although any food can be the agent, the most common offenders are milk, fish, meat, eggs, beans, and nuts.6,33,80–86 Other com- mon allergens are citrus, kiwis, peanuts, and apples.80 Individuals with atopy are most likely to experience urticaria as a result of IgE-related mechanisms, although reports confirm the presence of pseudoallergic reactions, whereby direct mast cell histamine release is involved in this reactivity. Aromatic volatile ingredients in tomatoes, wine, and culi- nary herbs (basil, fenugreek, cumin, dill, ginger, coriander, caraway, turmeric, parsley, pepper, rosemary, and thyme) have been considered the initiating factors in some of these non-IgE events.87,88 Food allergies may contribute greatly to the increased permeabil- ity of the gut in urticaria. A basic requirement for the development of a food allergy is the absorption of the allergen through the intestinal barrier. Several factors are known to significantly increase gut per- meability, including alcohol, NSAIDs, vasoactive amines ingested in foods or produced by bacterial action on essential amino acids, and possibly many food additives (see Chapter 19 for a full discussion). Increased intestinal permeability is also associated with autoimmune conditions.27–30 Because chronic urticaria is now known to be at least partially related to an autoimmune process, it is possible that, depend- ing on the genetic susceptibility of individual, bowel hyperpermeabil- ity may play a key role in the instigation of immune activity and its prolongation, leading to chronic urticaria. In addition, several investigators have reported alterations in gastric acidity, intestinal motility, and the function of the small intestine and biliary tract in up to 85% of patients with chronic urticaria.89–93 Selective IgA deficiency, gastroenteritis, hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, and other disruptive factors reported in patients with chronic urticaria may temporarily or permanently alter the barrier and immune function of the gut wall, predisposing an individual to allergic sensitization. In one study of 77 patients with chronic urticaria, 24 (31%) were diagnosed as achlorhydric, and 41 (53%) were shown to be hypochlo- rhydric.91 Treatment with hydrochloric acid and a vitamin B complex gave impressive clinical results, highlighting the importance of cor- recting any underlying factor in the treatment of chronic urticaria (see Chapter 23). Although IgE-mediated reactions are thought to predominate in immunological urticaria, it has been suggested that IgG-mediated reactions are probably responsible for the majority of adverse reactions to foods, as seen in general practice (see Chapter 134). IgG antigen– antibody complexes are capable of promoting complement activation and the subsequent generation of anaphylatoxins that promote mast cell degranulation. This could be a significant factor in some cases of urticaria. Fig. 222.4 summarizes the basic aspects of a hypothetical model of immune defense in the normal gut and the urticarial gut.

## Food Colorants

Food additives are a major factor in many cases of chronic urticaria in children. Colorants (azo dyes), flavorings (salicylates, aspartame), preservatives (benzoates, nitrites, sorbic acid), antioxidants (hydroxy- toluene, sulfite, gallate), and emulsifiers/stabilizers (polysorbates, veg- etable gums) have all been shown to produce urticarial reactions in sensitive individuals.2,17,28–57,66,69,81,115–118 The importance of the control of food additives was well demon- strated in a study of 64 patients with common urticaria. After 2 weeks on an additive-free diet, 73% of the patients had a significant reduction in symptoms. The diet strictly forbade preservatives, dyes, and antiox- idants. No fruits or refined sugars were allowed except honey. Rice, potatoes, and unprocessed cereals were allowed, as well as fresh milk.94

<!-- chunk -->

## Tartrazine. In 1959 the azo dye tartrazine (Food, Drug and

Cosmetic Act [FD&C] Yellow no. 5) was the first food dye reported to induce urticaria.95 Tartrazine is one of the most widely used colorants. It is added to almost every packaged food as well as many drugs, including some antihistamines, antibiotics, steroids, and sedatives.96 Reactions to this food additive are so common that its use has been banned in Sweden.97 In the United States the average daily per capita consumption of certified dyes is 15 mg, of which 85% is tartrazine. Among children, consumption is usually much higher. Tartrazine sensitivity has been calculated as occurring in 0.1% of the population.98 Tartrazine sensitivity is extremely common (20%–50%) in individ- uals sensitive to aspirin.33,96 Like aspirin, tartrazine is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a known inducer of asthma, urticaria, and other allergic conditions, particularly in children. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase by tartrazine or aspirin apparently shunts eicosanoid metabolism toward leukotriene synthesis, thereby increasing smooth muscle contraction and vascular permeability. In addition, tartrazine, as well as benzoate and aspirin, increases the production of the lymphokine leukocyte inhibitory factor.98 This results in an increase in perivascular mast cells and mononuclear cells. Histological examination of patients with urticaria shows that more than 95% have an increase in perivascular mast cells and mononuclear cells.99 Table 222.2 summarizes the findings in studies using provocation tests to determine sensitivity to tartrazine and other food additives in patients with urticaria. Rates have varied from 5% to 46%. Diets eliminating tartrazine as well as other azo dyes and food additives in sensitive individuals have in many cases been shown to be of great ben- efit. These studies are summarized in Table 222.3. Table 222.4 shows a recommended test battery.100

## Food Flavorings

<!-- chunk -->

## Salicylates. A broad range of salicylic acid esters are used to flavor

foods such as cake mixes, puddings, ice cream, chewing gum, and soft drinks. The mechanism of action of these agents is thought to be like that of aspirin.33 Salicylates are also found naturally in many foodstuffs. It is esti- mated that daily salicylate intake from foods is in the range of 10 to mg/day.101 Because this is very close to the level of salicylates used in clinical testing (usually 300 mg), dietary salicylate may be a significant factor in aspirin-sensitive individuals. Most fruits, especially berries and dried fruits, contain salicylates. Raisins and prunes have the highest amounts. Salicylates are also found in appreciable amounts in candies made of licorice and peppermint. Moderate levels of salicylate are found in nuts and seeds. Vegetables, legumes, grains, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products typically contain insignificant levels of salicylates. Salicylate levels are espe- cially high in some herbs and condiments, including curry powder (turmeric), paprika, thyme, dill, and oregano. Although the intake of these herbs and spices is relatively small, they can contribute to total dietary salicylate.101

<!-- chunk -->

## Other Flavoring Agents. Other flavoring agents, such as

cinnamon, vanilla, menthol, and other volatile compounds, may produce urticaria in some individuals.33 For example, the artificial sweetener aspartame has been shown to induce urticaria.102

<!-- chunk -->

## Food Preservatives

<!-- chunk -->

## Benzoates. Benzoic acid and benzoates are the most commonly

used food preservatives. Although the incidence of adverse reactions to these compounds is thought to be less than 1% for the general population, the frequency of positive challenges in patients with chronic urticaria varies from 4% to 44%, as illustrated in Table 222.2. Fish and shrimp frequently contain extremely high quantities of benzoates. This may be one reason why adverse reactions to these foods are so common in patients with urticaria.

<!-- chunk -->

## Butylated Hydroxytoluene and Butylated Hydroxyanisole. Butyl-

ated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole are the primary antioxidants used in prepared and packaged foods. Typically, 15% of patients with chronic urticaria test positive to oral challenge with BHT.46,59,68,72 The use of chewing gum containing BHT was enough to induce urticaria in one patient.103

<!-- chunk -->

## Sulfites. Sulfites, like tartrazine, have been shown to induce

asthma, urticaria, and angioedema in sensitive individuals.104,105 The source may be varied because these compounds are ubiquitous in foods and drugs. They are typically added to processed foods to prevent microbial spoilage and keep them from browning or changing color. The earliest known use of sulfites was in the treatment of wines with sulfur dioxide by the Romans. Sulfites are sprayed on fresh foods such as shrimp, fruits, and vegetables.

They are also used as antioxidants and preservatives in many pharmaceuticals. Sulfites have caused such a wide range of health problems, such as asthma and urticaria, that their use on fresh fruits and vegetables (except potatoes) was banned in the United States in 1986.97 The average person consumes an average of 2 to 3 mg/day of sul- fites. Wine and beer drinkers typically consume up to 10 mg/day, and individuals who frequent restaurants for meals may ingest up to mg/day.104 Normally, the enzyme sulfite oxidase metabolizes sulfites to safer sulfates, which are excreted in the urine. People with a poorly functioning sulfoxidation system, however, have an increased ratio of sulfite to sulfate in their urine. Sulfite oxi- dase depends on the trace mineral molybdenum. Although most nutrition textbooks list molybdenum deficiency as uncommon, an Austrian study of 1750 patients found that 41.5% were molyb- denum deficient.102

## Food Emulsifiers and Stabilizers

A variety of compounds are used to emulsify and stabilize many commercial foods to ensure that the solids, oils, and liquids do not separate out. Most of the foods containing these compounds are heterogeneous because they usually contain antioxidants, preserva- tives, and dyes. Polysorbate in ice cream has been reported to induce urticaria, and vegetable gums such as acacia, gum arabic, tragacanth, quince, and carrageenan may also induce urticaria in susceptible individuals.33

<!-- chunk -->

## Infections

Infections are a major cause of urticaria in children.6 Apparently, in adults, immunological tolerance occurs to many microorgan- isms owing to repeated massive antigen exposure. The role of bac- teria, viruses, and yeast (C. albicans) in urticaria is briefly reviewed here. Chronic Trichomonas infections have also been found to cause urticaria.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacteria

As noted previously, H. pylori has been implicated in chronic urti- caria. Bacterial infections contribute to urticaria in two other major settings—acute streptococcal tonsillitis in children and chronic dental infections in adults. In the first setting, acute urticaria predominates, whereas in the second, chronic urticaria predominates.6

<!-- chunk -->

## Viruses

Hepatitis B is the most common cause of virally induced urticaria. One study found that 15.3% of patients with chronic urticaria had anti–hepatitis B surface antibodies.106 Urticaria has also been strongly linked to infectious mononucleosis and may develop several weeks before clinical manifestations. The incidence of urticaria during infec- tious mononucleosis is 5%.6

<!-- chunk -->

## Candida albicans

The association between C. albicans and chronic urticaria has been suggested in several clinical studies. The number of patients with chronic urticaria who react positively to an immediate skin test with Candida antigens is 19% to 81%, compared with 10% to 15% of normal subjects.48,107–113 It appears that sensitivity to C. albicans is an important factor in at least 25% of patients with chronic urti- caria.110 Approximately 70% of patients with a positive skin reac- tion also react to oral provocation tests using foods prepared with yeasts. Treatment with nystatin has demonstrated that elimination of the organism can achieve a cure in several individuals with positive skin test results, although a placebo response cannot be ruled out. However, more patients have responded to a “yeast-free” diet than to the simple elimination of the organism in clinical trials. The yeast- free diet employed excluded breads, buns, sausage, wine, beer, cider, grapes, sultanas, Marmite, Bovril, vinegar, tomato, ketchup, pickles, and prepared foods containing food yeasts. For example, in a study of 49 patients with proven sensitivity to Candida, 9 showed responses to a 3-week course of nystatin, whereas 18 became symptom-free only after adopting the yeast-free diet.110 This finding would seem to sup- port the importance of diet along with elimination of the yeast. Further support for the importance of diet can be found in a study of 36 patients with a positive skin-prick test response to Candida. Only 3 patients became asymptomatic with nystatin alone, compared with 23 with diet therapy after the nystatin therapy.111 Desensitizing patients to C. albicans with the use of a Candida cell-wall extract has also demonstrated encouraging results in some patients, although the treatment of these individuals also included increasing gastrointestinal fermentation and acidity as well as the elim- ination of yeast.112,113

not been elucidated. The review showed that a high dose (60,000 IU/ week) of vitamin D supplementation for 4 to 12 weeks might help to decrease the disease activity in some patients with CSU.114 Note that although the total weekly dose is reported, bone health research shows that daily administration is more effective than a weekly bolus.


<!-- chunk -->

## Psychological Aspects

In one retrospective study involving 236 cases of chronic urticaria, psychological factors, such as stress, were reported to be the most common primary cause.115 Stress appears to play an important role through a reduction of intestinal secretory IgA levels. In one study of 15 patients with chronic urticaria, relaxation therapy and hypnosis were shown to provide significant benefit.116 Patients were given an audiotape and asked to use the relaxation techniques described on the tape at home. At a follow-up examination 5 to 14 months after the initial ses- sion, six patients were free of hives, and seven others reported improvement.

<!-- chunk -->

## Ultraviolet Light Therapy

Ultraviolet light has been shown to be of some benefit to patients with chronic urticaria.117,118 Both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) light therapies have been used. Patients with cold, cholinergic, and dermographic urticarias display the greatest therapeutic response.

<!-- chunk -->

## Thyroid

The association of thyroid disease and autoimmunity with urticaria has been established for decades.119–124 The prevalence of antithyroid anti- bodies in the normal population has been estimated at 3% to 6%, and they are commonly found in association with other autoimmune con- ditions, such as pernicious anemia and vitiligo.122 A subset of patients with chronic urticaria may be best helped by suppressing thyroiditis, by thyroid hormone therapy, by surgery, or by antithyroid medication. One study evaluated a group of 624 patients with presumed idio- pathic chronic urticaria and angioedema. From these, 90 patients were found to have thyroid autoimmunity.123 Forty-six of these patients were treated with l-thyroxine therapy, eight of whom had remission within 4 weeks of therapy. Four patients with high thyroid antibody titers had repeated exacerbations when therapy was discontinued and had repeated remissions when therapy with l-thyroxine was resumed. Although in most cases treatment with l-thyroxine did not improve the patient’s urticaria or angioedema, a few did demonstrate a dramatic response. Another study reported that thyroid hormone replacement therapy dramatically improved chronic urticaria in patients who had normal thyroid function but had evidence of thyroid autoimmunity. Of seven patients with chronic urticaria, five were started on thyroid hormone; doses were increased in two. Their urticaria resolved within 2 to weeks, at which time the thyroid therapy was discontinued. In five patients, the symptoms returned within 4 weeks, then resolved within 4 weeks of restarting the hormone therapy. Antithyroid antibodies did not correlate with clinical response.123 There have been cases in which resolution of chronic urticaria associated with thyrotoxicosis has also been seen in patients treated with antithyroid medication and in those treated with radioactive iodine.122 Subclinical hypothyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity and may underlie the thyroid–urticaria association in some cases. Although the usefulness of thyroid hormone therapy in patients who are euthyroid and have chronic urticaria has not been demon- strated in a controlled trial, testing for thyroid autoimmunity is cer- tainly warranted in cases refractory to other forms of therapy.

## Conventional Drug Treatment

CSU is a disease that is particularly difficult to treat. Although nonse- dating antihistamines are recommended as first-line agents, a substan- tial proportion of patients remain poorly responsive to these agents even if H 2 -receptor antagonists and/or leukotriene pathway inhibitors are added. Such patients are often treated with corticosteroids, cyc- losporine, dapsone or omalizumab, and alternatives to these agents would be a welcome addition if efficacy could be shown with an acceptable tolerability profile and cost.125,126 Diphenhydramine, an anticholinergic drug available without pre- scription, is often recommended for both acute and chronic urticaria. Higher cumulative anticholinergic use is associated with an increased risk for dementia (p < 0.001).127 Efforts to increase awareness among health care professionals and older adults about this potential medica- tion-related risk are important to minimize anticholinergic use over time.

## Phototherapy

A randomized, prospective, observer-blinded comparative study of 50 patients with steroid-dependent CRU (6 months of spontaneous urticaria with no response after 3 consecutive months of antihista- mines and steroid dependence) were administered either psoralen and UVA (PUVA; group A) or narrowband UVB (NB-UVB; group B) for 90 days, with a posttreatment follow-up of 90 days. The Average Urticaria Activity Score 7 (aUAS7) decreased at 90 days in both groups and continued to decrease at 180 days. The Outcome Scoring Scale (OSS) favorably increased at 90 days and persisted at 180 days. NB-UVB was statistically better than PUVA at different time points. The authors concluded that phototherapy, especially NB-UVB, is an effective, safe, and affordable therapeutic modal- ity for steroid-dependent CRU and should be tried before third- line treatment options such as omalizumab, ciclosporin, and other immunosuppressants.128

## Traditional Chinese Medicine/Acupuncture Therapy

Acupuncture has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to effectively treat urticaria129,130 and type I allergic con- ditions.131 Known as “wind wheal,” urticaria is also referred to by Chinese practitioners as the “hidden rash,” owing to its ephemeral nature. Three standard TCM etiologies are considered for urticaria. Urticarial disease due to wind heat typically manifests as red rashes with pruritus. Wind damp etiology correlates with lighter-colored rashes and a heavy sensation in the body. Alternatively, red rashes that appear with concomitant epigastric or abdominal pain and diarrhea or constipation are considered a derivation of stomach and small intestinal heat. Acute urticaria can be easily and effectively treated with acupuncture, in which LI11 (Quchi), Sp10 (Xuehai), Sp6 (Sanyinjiao), and S36 (Zusanli) are the acupuncture points most commonly prescribed.131 Auricular acupuncture may also accompany body acupuncture points for enhanced effect. The traditional Chinese herbal formula Jade Screen has been found to enhance the effective- ness of the antihistamine desloratadine in the treatment of chronic urticaria (P < 0.00001).132 Jade Screen formula consists of three traditional Chinese medicines, including Astragalus membranaceus, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, and Radix Saposhnikoviae. External herbal washes with Fructus arctii (burdock) are also used in TCM. A systematic review of six randomized controlled trials con- cluded that acupuncture might be effective and safe for chronic urticaria in relieving symptoms, although based on a low level of evidence.133

## 12

Vitamin B 12 has been anecdotally reported to be of value in the treat- ment of acute and chronic urticaria.134,135 A study published in investigated the prevalence of B 12 deficiency in patients with CIU and also its relationship to gastric H. pylori infection and serological markers of autoimmunity (antithyroglobulin, thyroid microsomal, gastric parietal cell [GPC], and antinuclear autoantibodies). Thirty- three patients with CIU and 27 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum B 12 levels were below the normal reference range in 11/33 patients with CIU. The mean serum B 12 levels among patients with CIU and the controls were significantly lower in those with CIU (p = 0.0001). Antithyroid antibodies were positive in 6 of 11 patients with low B 12 levels but only in 4 of 27 healthy controls (p = 0.019). Anti- GPC antibodies were positive in 4 of 11 patients with CIU and low B 12 levels, but only in 2 of 27 healthy controls (p = 0.047). In patients with CIU, there was no difference in the frequency of IgG H. pylori antibodies between those with low B 12 levels and normal B 12 levels. Among the 19 patients who underwent gastric endoscopy, 15 patients had chronic antral gastritis, 2 patients had atrophic gastritis, and there were normal findings in 2 patients. The higher frequency of antithyroid and anti-GPC antibodies in patients with low B 12 levels suggest that low B 12 levels in CIU may be of an autoimmune nature.136 Although serum vitamin B 12 levels are normal in most patients, additional vitamin B 12 appears to be of value.

As mentioned previously, high-dose vitamin D 3 therapy may be bene- ficial for some patients with chronic urticaria.

## Quercetin

Considering the importance of mast cell degranulation in the patho- genesis of urticaria, quercetin’s significant in vitro activity as a mast cell stabilizer (and inhibitor of many of the pathways of inflammation; see Chapter 84) suggests that it may be very useful in treating urticaria. This possibility is strengthened by the observation that sodium cromo- glycate (at 200–400 mg four times daily), a compound similar to quer- cetin, confers excellent protection against the development of urticaria and angioedema in response to ingested food allergens.137

<!-- chunk -->

## Fish Oil

Three patients with salicylate-induced urticaria experienced allevia- tion of symptoms following dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids. All three patients experienced severe urticaria, asthma requiring systemic steroid therapy, and anaphylactic reactions. After dietary supplementation with 10 g daily of fish oil providing 3000 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 6 to 8 weeks, all three experienced complete or virtually complete resolu- tion of symptoms, allowing discontinuation of systemic corticosteroid therapy. Symptoms relapsed after dose reduction.138


A pilot study of Lactobacillus salivarius LS01 and Bifidobacterium breve BR03 administered twice daily for 8 weeks modestly reduced the symp- toms scores and improved quality-of-life scores in a minority of patients with refractory CSU. No statistical significance was reported.139

## Physical Evaluation and History

A thorough history and physical evaluation are imperative for the proper diagnosis of urticaria and should include a careful history listing all medications, supplements, and botanicals. Evaluation should also detail travel, recent infection, occupational exposure, timing and onset of lesions, morphology, associated symptoms, family medical history, and preexist- ing allergies. Contact sensitivities such as latex allergy140 and exposure to physical stimuli should be documented. History of tattoos should be explored for possible correlations. A diet and lifestyle diary that chronicles date and time, foods eaten, major activities, bowel and urine habits, and stress should be gathered in order to fully characterize the potential tem- poral relationships of urticaria with specific ingested foods and activities. A comprehensive physical examination can also uncover important diag- nostic clues that may help to diagnose comorbidities. A list of pertinent questions to ask during the history-taking for urticaria suggested by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization guidelines can be found in Table 222.5.141

<!-- chunk -->

## Laboratory Testing

In cases of CSU, neither US nor European guidelines recommend extensive laboratory testing because it rarely identifies the cause or affects long-term management. Provocation testing can be performed based on the patient’s history (application of heat, cold, pressure, etc.). In cases where an etiology is suspected, infections are the most com- mon identified cause.142 One review of 29 large studies of laboratory testing in chronic urti- caria, involving 6462 patients, demonstrated no relationship between numbers of identified diagnoses and numbers of performed tests.143 This review noted that systemic diseases (which excluded physical urti- carias, allergens, infections, and psychological causes) were identified

and believed to be related causally to the urticaria in only 1.6% of patients; these disorders included vasculitis, thyroid disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, other rheumatic disease, hereditary angioedema, and hematological or oncological conditions. If symptoms do not remit after proper history and physical exam- ination have been performed and the therapies listed here have been tried, it may be useful to perform a complete blood count with differ- ential, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement, liver function tests, antinuclear antibody titer measurements, and thyroid panel with antithyroid autoantibody measurements. These tests may help ferret out most of the uncommon cases with a detectable but unsuspected underlying cause (e.g., infectious, parasitical, rheumatic, thyroid, and hematological conditions). Although biopsy is not recommended for most cases of chronic urticaria, biopsy can provide useful information to rule out urticarial vasculitis when this condition is suspected clinically.24


Regarding the conventional management of chronic urticaria, patients often show incomplete responses to antihistamines and are often uncom- fortable and frustrated by chronic pruritus. Some cases do respond to systemic corticosteroids, but the potentially serious side effects associ- ated with these medications preclude their safe chronic use.24 See Box 222.3 for a complete list of conventional drugs used to treat urticaria. The basic natural therapeutic approach involves the identification and control of all factors that promote the patient’s urticarial response. Obtaining a careful and thorough history is paramount to this process. Acute urticaria is usually a self-limiting disease, especially once the eliciting agent has been removed or reduced. Chronic urticaria also responds to the removal of the eliciting agent or agents if they can be identified. In severe anaphylaxis, appropriate emergency care procedures should be followed.


Although rarely used in conventional medical therapy, evidence is mounting to support the wisdom of the elimination diet.24,144 An elimination or oligoantigenic diet is of utmost importance in the treatment of chronic urticaria (see Chapters 18 and 134). The diet should eliminate not only suspected allergens but also all food additives. The strictest elimination diets allow only water, lamb, rice, pears, and vegetables. Those foods most commonly associated with inducing urticaria (i.e., milk, eggs, chicken, fruits, nuts, and additives) should be avoided.85 Foods containing vasoactive amines should be eliminated even if no direct allergy to them is noted; the primary foods to eliminate are cured meat, alcoholic beverages, cheese, chocolate, citrus fruits, and shellfish. The importance of eliminating food additives cannot be over- stated. If food additives do in fact increase the number of perivas- cular mast cells in the skin, they may also do the same in the small intestine, thereby greatly raising the risk of developing a “leaky gut.”

## Psychological

The patient should perform relaxation techniques daily. Listening to audio relaxation programs may be an appropriate way to induce the desired state. Appropriate mind–body management programs leading to good clinical outcomes for chronic urticaria are depen- dent on the clinician’s ability to solicit and discern unique patient “stories.” Cognitive therapy and psychospiritual approaches can assist patients to release habitual thought patterns and emotional patterns that can play a role in the initiation and persistence of chronic urticaria.145,146


Phototherapy is recommended for chronic urticaria. Tepid oatmeal baths may also help calm urticarial symptoms, but caution should be exercised with physical modalities when physical triggers such as heat, cold, and water are salient for the patient.

## 1835CHAPTER 223 Uterine Fibroids

Fibroids can undergo degenerative changes. One type of degen- erative change occurs when the continued growth of the fibroid out- paces the blood supply. This occurs in approximately 10% of pregnant women with fibroids, and the resultant ischemia and necrosis can be painful. A more common type of degenerative change involves a loss of cellular detail as a result of a decrease in the tumor’s vascularity. Necrosis leads to cystic degeneration. Calcification can occur over time and is usually seen in postmenopausal women.

## Environmental Endocrine Disrupters

Consistent with a hormonal influence on fibroma development, environ- mental exposures to endocrine-disrupting pollutants also influence risk. Analysis of the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data found that higher exposure to monobutyl phthalate (MBP) was associated with a 56% higher risk for self-reported fibroids, whereas another phthalate metabolite (mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [MEHP]) was associated with a 37% reduction in risk.9 Subsequent studies have also found phthalate exposure to be positively associated with uterine volume among women undergoing surgery for fibroid treatment, and phthalates may have a combined effect with genetic factors, including a nearly sixfold increase in risk among women with high exposure and the GSTM1 null genotype.10,11 Other persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), have been associated with an elevated risk for fibroid incidence.12


On the basis of mitotic count, nuclear atypia, and other morphological features, uterine smooth muscle tumors can be classified as leiomy- omas, smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential, and leiomyosarcomas. A presumptive diagnosis of fibroids can often be made simply with a thorough history and adequate pelvic examination. An enlarged, firm uterus or a uterus with irregular edges is the main palpation finding. The diagnostician must distinguish a possible fibroid from a malignant ovarian tumor, fallopian tube or ovarian-region abscess, diverticulum, pelvic kidney, endometriosis, congenital anomalies, pelvic adhesions, and a retroperitoneal tumor (rare). Not all of these distinctions can be made with a medical history, physical examination, and pelvic ultra- sonography. Submucosal pedunculated fibroids can be visualized with laparoscopy, as can intramural and subserous fibroids. Numerous classifications for uterine fibroids exist, typically accord- ing to their location, as follows: • Submucosal (just under the endometrium) • Intramural (within the uterine muscle wall) • Subserosal (from the outer wall of the uterus) • Interligamentous (in the cervix between the two layers of the broad ligament) • Pedunculated (on a stalk, either submucosal or subserous) More recent classification systems, such as that approved by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Executive Board, also include hybrid types and specify the degree of intramural extension and/or uterine cavity distortion.13


Natural therapies for uterine fibroids largely involve managing any troublesome symptoms. Women who are seeking an alternative to sur- gical intervention for uterine fibroids will not find a reliable alternative to shrink their tumors. The following therapies may be able to help keep a fibroid from growing larger and are usually able to successfully resolve or improve most symptoms related to the tumor. Expectations to reduce the size of fibroids must be low, although there are individual case reports of such results. Reduction in fibroid size due to treatment is difficult to assess, especially in perimenopausal women in their 40s, who at some point will have lower endogenous estrogen production, with resultant diminution of the fibroid.


No dietary approach is known to prevent or shrink uterine fibroids. However, there are very strong rationales for several dietary inter- ventions. For example, a diet high in saturated fats is associated with higher blood levels of estrogen and therefore could have the potential to exacerbate fibroids. Also, low-fiber diets are associated with elevated estrogen levels and poor excretion of estrogen. Dietary change by itself is unlikely to reduce the size of fibroids, but good dietary habits are still important for general health; moreover, they may reduce some of the gastrointestinal symptoms that can be associated with large fibroids or pedunculated fibroids and an enlarged uterus. Furthermore, specific foods and dietary patterns have been associated with a reduced risk for fibroid development and may play a role in preventing a recurrence. Specifically, greater consumption of fruits and vegetables appears protective, and a higher intake of broccoli, cabbage (cruciferous veg- etables), tomato, and apple has been associated with lower risk.14,15 Surprisingly, dietary omega-3 intake has been associated with a slightly greater risk for fibroid development, at least among African American women.16 Clinical observation has demonstrated that natural therapies work best in the context of a healthy lifestyle, including dietary changes. Improving one’s diet can help to decrease heavy bleeding or the pain and discomfort caused by the fibroids. In addition to these potential benefits, dietary improvements enhance general well-being. The tradition of naturopathic medicine holds firmly to the influence of the health of the liver on the health and vitality of an individual. The liver metabolizes estrogen, which can be eliminated from the body by

## 1836SECTION 6 Diseases

converting it to estrone and finally to estriol, a weaker form of estrogen that has very little ability to stimulate the uterus. Failure of the liver to effectively metabolize estradiol may be one mechanism by which the uterus becomes overestrogenized and responds with fibroid growths. Support for the role of estrogen also stems from genetic associations with fibroma risk; polymorphisms in the COMT, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 genes all have been linked to a two- to threefold increase in risk for fibro- mas and are involved in estrogen metabolism. Similarly, in one small study, women with homozygous polymorphisms in both CYP17A1 (estrogen synthesis) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) had nearly a twen- tyfold increase in the risk for fibroids compared with controls.17,18 Saturated fats, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and “junk foods” are pre- sumably problematic in two main ways. First, they interfere with the body’s ability to metabolize estradiol to estrone to estriol. Second, some of them are deficient in B vitamins or interfere with B-vitamin metabolism. If B vitamins are lacking in the diet, the liver will lack some of the raw materials it needs to carry out its metabolic processes and regulate estrogen levels. Whole grains—such as brown rice, oats, buckwheat, millet, and rye—are excellent sources of B vitamins. Whole grains also help the body excrete estrogens through the bowel. The role of whole-grain fiber in lowering estrogen levels was first reported in 1982.19 This study found that vegetarian women who eat a high-fiber, low-fat diet have lower blood estrogen levels than omnivorous women with low-fiber diets. Once again, the logic of a high-fiber diet would have implica- tions in preventing and perhaps reducing uterine fibroids because of the stimulating effect of estrogen on fibroid growth. A high-fiber diet may also help to relieve some of the bloating and congestion that are sometimes associated with fibroids. Fiber, by bulking up the stool and regulating bowel movements, may relieve some of these symptoms. Some women have a hard time tolerating increased fiber in their diets because their digestive function is other- wise compromised. Because there is an association between having uterine fibroids and a fourfold increase in the risk of endometrial cancer,19 three dietary considerations stand out above the others: to increase dietary fiber, lower dietary fat, and increase the intake of soy products and other legumes, although this last component has come into question because it may contribute to fibroid incidence. A case-control study in a mul- tiethnic population (Japanese, white, Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Chinese) examined the roles of dietary soy, fiber, and related foods and nutrients in relation to the risk of endometrial cancer.20 In total 332 women with endometrial cancer were compared with women in the general multiethnic population, and all were interviewed by means of a dietary questionnaire. The researchers found positive associations between a higher level of fat intake and endometrial cancer, between a higher level of fiber intake and a reduction in the risk for endometrial cancer, and between a higher consumption of soy products and other legumes and a decreased risk of endometrial cancer. Similar reductions in risk were found for greater consumption of other sources of phy- toestrogens, such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and seaweeds. The researchers concluded that plant-based diets low in calories from fat, high in fiber, and rich in legumes (especially soybeans), whole-grain foods, vegetables, and fruits reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. These dietary associations may explain, at least in part, the lower rates of uterine cancer in Asian countries compared with the United States. Recent studies have supported this protective benefit; a study among women in northern Italy found that a higher consumption of vegeta- bles is associated with roughly only one third the risk for endometrial cancer, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with approximately one-half the risk.21 In 2019, data from the Women’s Health Initiative showed that the “healthy lifestyle index,” a composite of diet, alcohol consumption and tobacco use, and physical activity and body mass index (BMI), was associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer overall as well as cancer subtypes.22 Some have suggested that because soy foods are high in phytoestro- gens (specifically isoflavones), which have a weak estrogenic effect, women with uterine fibroids or endometrial cancer should avoid phy- toestrogens. This issue deserves some clarification. Soy phytoestrogens do not appear to have an estrogenic effect on the human uterus except in doses higher than 150 mg isoflavones daily in postmenopausal women. They appear to be selective in terms of the tissues on which they have an estrogenic effect and the tissues or organs on which they have an anti- estrogenic effect. Soy foods may be analogous to a class of drugs called selective estrogen-receptor modulators: they act one way in one part of the body and another way in a different part of the body. It seems that in the uterus, soy isoflavones have an antiestrogenic effect, although recent clinical data show their relation to fibroids as more complicated.


Many of the symptoms related to uterine fibroids can be effectively treated with natural therapies. This section presents nutritional supplements that may control or diminish the growth of fibroids. Unfortunately, these recommendations are based more on tradition, theory, logic, and clinical experiences than on scientific evidence.

## Lipotropic Factors

Supplements such as inositol and choline exert a lipotropic effect— that is, they promote the removal of fat from the liver. Lipotropic sup- plements usually are a combination vitamin-and-herbal formulation and sometimes an animal liver extract designed to support the liver’s function in removing fat, detoxifying the body’s wastes, detoxifying external harmful substances (pesticides, fossil fuels, etc.), and metabo- lizing and excreting estrogens. These lipotropic products vary in their formulations, depending on the manufacturer, but they are all similar and are intended for the same uses. Many now contain anticancer phy- tonutrients found in cabbage-family vegetables, such as indole-3-car- binol (I3C), diindolylmethane (DIM), and sulforaphane. Research has shown that these compounds help to break down cancer-causing forms of estrogens to nontoxic forms, making them especially import- ant in women with uterine fibroids.23,24

## Pancreatic Enzymes

Supplementation with pancreatic enzymes is usually done to treat pan- creatic insufficiency with symptoms of abdominal bloating, gas, indi- gestion, undigested food in the stool, and malabsorption. The logic for their use in the treatment of uterine fibroids is that the pancreatic enzymes help digest the fibrous/smooth muscle tissue and thus dis- solve the fibroids. When used for this purpose, the pancreatic enzyme supplement must be taken between rather than with meals.


In recent years, much research has been done on the role of vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for fibroids, suggesting that vitamin D phys- iology may affect fibroma development through a variety of pathways (Fig. 223.2). Furthermore, unlike most other natural therapies for fibroma treatment, there is some clinical data to suggest that vitamin D supplementation may have efficacy as treatment, not just preven- tion. Vitamin D supplementation was shown to reduce the progression to extensive disease among women with “small burden” fibroids; in this group, only 13.2% receiving vitamin D needed surgical or medical treatment after 1 year, versus 30.9% in the control group.25 It has been suggested that a target concentration of 40 to 60 ng/mL 25-OH vitamin D may be optimal.26

## Traditional Botanical Medicines

Many plants have been used in traditional herbal medicines in an attempt to treat women with uterine fibroids. The plants and herbal formulations described here are used in attempting to reduce uterine fibroids or slow their growth. They have been anecdotally reported to achieve modest success in reducing the size and number of uterine fibroids. There is no scientific research to document the outcomes, but the protocol is presented here as an option.

• Chaste tree (Vitex agnus castus) • Nettles (Urtica dioica) • Burdock root (Arctium lappa) • Dandelion root (Taraxacum officinalis) • Oregon grape (Berberis aquifolium) • Crila (Crinum latifolium) • Crila has been a part of Vietnamese history and folklore for gen- erations. Numerous benefits of Crinum have been reported over the years, but none had been clinically studied until recently. Of the 12 varieties of Crila, one specific variety in particular, the C. latifolium “Tram,” named after the leading researcher, has been studied in women with uterine fibroids. A 3-month study of women with uterine fibroid tumors was conducted in three hos- pitals in Vietnam in 2007. Crila decreased the size or stopped the growth of the fibroid tumors in 79.5% of the women. In 20.5%, tumor growth continued at a very slow rate. Whereas a heavy menstrual flow was reported by 36% of the women before taking Crila, this had decreased to only 1% after treatment. Side effects reported were slight, including nausea, headache, vaginal dryness, and hot flashes, but these decreased over time.27

## Herbal Phytoestrogens

Three types of phytoestrogens are found in medicinal plants: resor- cylic acid lactones, steroids and sterols, and phenolics. Phytoestrogens are present in virtually every plant in at least modest levels, with some plants having particularly high levels. Resorcylic acid lactones are not true phytoestrogens because they come from plant mold contamina- tion rather than being synthesized by the plant. Steroids are the classic steroidal estrogens, estradiol and estrone, which are found in very minute amounts in a few plants such as apple seeds, date palms, and pomegranate seeds in the range of 1 to 10 parts per billion.28–30 Diosgenin is a steroid derivative found in at least plants, including wild yam species. Beta-sitosterol is the most common phytosterol and hence is dis- tributed widely throughout the plant kingdom. It is found in plant oils such as wheat germ oil, cottonseed oil, and soybean oil and is the dom- inant phytosterol found in garlic and onions. Herbal sources include

licorice root, saw palmetto, and red clover. Stigmasterol is closely related to beta-sitosterol. Soybean oil is an important source of stig- masterol; it is a better source for laboratory synthesis of progesterone than beta-sitosterol. Some herbal sources are burdock, fennel, licorice, alfalfa, anise, and sage. The phenolic phytoestrogens are members of the largest single family of plant substances, the flavonoids, which has over 4000 individual members. The term flavonoid derives from the Latin flavus, meaning “yellow,” because the flavonoids are responsible for the yellow, red, white, and blue pigments in plants. Phenolics include the following substances: • Isoflavones, which are present in higher concentrations in legumes, especially soybeans, than in any other plants • Coumestans, of which coumestrol is the one known estrogenic member. Coumestrol is approximately six times more estrogenic than the isoflavones.31 Red clover is a medicinal plant with consid- erable coumestans. • Lignans, found in high concentrations in grains and cereals and highest in flaxseeds There has been some concern and controversy about how phy- toestrogens affect the uterus as well as whether, because they have an estrogenic effect, they should be avoided in women with uterine fibroids or endometrial cancer. Research has shown that phytoestro- gens actually reduce the incidence of uterine cancer. Most of the research on the effects of phytoestrogens on the uterus is found in relation to the agriculture industry and the health of graz- ing animals. In the 1940s it was reported that the grazing of sheep on red clover in Australia was responsible for their infertility.32 A Finnish study of pasture legumes identified red clover as containing the highest concentrations of phytoestrogens33 and showed that abundant intake of red clover resulted in fertility problems in cattle.34 In one study on the effects of phytoestrogens in sheep, it was noted that both coumestans and isoflavones produce changes similar to stimulation with steroidal hormones such as estradiol in all of the tar- get organs.35 Among these changes was an increase in uterine weight. Other investigators have examined the binding of phytoestrogens to the uterus and vagina. Coumestrol has temporarily enhanced the uptake of estradiol by the uterus and vagina only 1 hour after injection into mice.36 The researchers of this study also noted that coumestrol actually inhibited the uptake of estradiol by the uterus in a prolonged manner; they postulated that there was actually an inhibitory effect at the estradiol receptor sites. Other researchers have observed that coumestans and isoflavones compete with estradiol for uterine recep- tor sites but have less affinity for them than estradiol does.37 Coumestrol has been found to increase uterine weight at a 100-mcg dose when given to rats at a certain time in the development of glands.38 The estrogenic effect of phytoestrogens appears to be dose dependent. When given in high enough doses, phytoestrogens have estrogenic effects on all the tissues that are targets of estradiol. Two questions must be answered: What is an excessively high dose, and are the observations in animals translatable to humans? One way of answering the first ques- tion is to note that countries with a high intake of phytoestrogens (Japan, Thailand, China) do not have increased rates of uterine fibroids. As in the case of breast cancer, data on women of different cultures support the conclusion that soy phytoestrogens are not an estrogen stimulus for the endometrium. Soy is probably an estrogen antagonist in the uterus, at least at doses of less than 150 mg/day, and it is associ- ated with low rates of endometrial cancer in countries where the intake of soy phytoestrogens is high.39 One recent study did raise some concern about high doses of soy phytoestrogens and endometrial effects.40 A total of 298 women com- pleted a 5-year study of either 150 mg/day of soy isoflavones or a pla- cebo tablet. Of the women using 150 mg of soy isoflavones, 70% had an endometrium classified as atrophic, versus 81% of those receiving the placebo. The occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia was higher in the soy group versus the placebo group as well (3.37% vs. 0%). There were no endometrial cancers in either group. The estrogenic effect was not detectable at 30 months but only at the end of the 5-year study. A second recent study also suggests that soy may be problematic. In an analysis of nearly 1300 women (213 uterine leiomyomas), in addition to oral contraceptive use, soybean and soymilk intake was associated with an increase in risk for fibroma development (OR ,7.3), suggesting that soy intake should be limited (Fig. 223.3).41 0 10 30 40 012345 C u m ul a ti v e i n ci d e n c e 2 0 ( % ) Time (year) Combined Group Frequent oral contraceptive use group Frequesnt milk or soybean consumer group Total Neither group

## Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F

An uncontrolled but well-designed study looked at the efficacy of a tradi- tional Chinese herbal therapy, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, on uterine fibroids.42 The researchers used several objective measures for clinical response, including ultrasonographic measurement of fibroid size and determination of blood estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, folli- cle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolac- tin levels by radioimmunoassay. Measurements were taken at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Treatment was effective and time dependent; 28% of fibroids responded in 3 to 4 months and 52% in 5 to 6 months. A total of 25 of the 65 patients were amenorrheic during the course of treat- ment. Compared with pretreatment values, treatment with T. wilfordii induced a rise in mean LH and FSH levels and a decrease in mean estra- diol and progesterone levels. The researchers speculated that this result was likely due to a reversible inhibitory effect on the ovaries.

## Bioidentical Progesterone

Several older studies have suggested that progesterone may inhibit the growth of uterine fibroids. Lipschutz43 demonstrated that progester- one administered to guinea pigs prevented the formation of tumors that would otherwise be induced by estrogen. In 1946 Goodman44 reported six cases of clinically diagnosed uterine fibroids that regressed after the use of progesterone therapy. In relation to uterine fibroids, the expression and responsiveness of estrogen and progesterone recep- tor sites to these hormones is a complex issue.45 Lee46 posited that because uterine fibroids are a result of estrogen stimulation and what he calls “estrogen dominance,” the problem is a relative progesterone deficiency, and the corrective is to use natural progesterone. He asserted that estrogen dominance is a much greater problem than is recognized by conventional medicine: Because many women in their mid-thirties begin to have nonovulat- ing cycles, they are producing much less progesterone than expected but still producing normal (or more) estrogen. They retain water and salt, their breasts swell and become fibrocystic, gain weight (especially around the hips and torso), become depressed and lose sex drive; in addition, their bones suffer mineral loss and they develop fibroids. All are signs of estrogen dominance relative to a proges- terone deficiency. When sufficient natural progesterone is replaced, fibroid tumors no longer grow in size (they generally decrease in size) and can be kept from growing until menopause, after which they will atrophy. This is the effect of reversing estrogen dominance. The preferred form of natural progesterone for treating fibroids (unless the patient has heavy bleeding) is a topical cream with about 400 mg of progesterone per one ounce of cream. One-quarter teaspoon of the cream is to be applied, one to two times daily for 1 week after the menses, and then one-quarter to one-half teaspoon twice daily for the next 2 weeks (the second half of the menstrual cycle). The progester- one cream is not used for 1 week during the menstrual flow. The cream is applied to the inner arms, chest, inner thighs, and/or palms. Another theory and counter-opinion about the relationship of progesterone to uterine fibroids raises some questions about the use of the hormone in women with fibroids. Rein et al.47 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital published a report in 1995 stating not only that is there no evidence of estrogen directly stimulating myoma growth but also that progesterone and progestins promote the growth of fibroids.47 The report cites the biochemical, histological, and clinical evidence supporting an important role for progesterone and progestins in the growth of uterine myomas. This comprehensive hypothesis is based on the analysis of many different technical studies and, according to the reviewers, suggests that the development and growth of myomas involve a multistep chain of events.


The patient should consume a diet low in fat and high in fiber, vegeta- bles, whole grains, and flaxseeds, consistent with a Mediterranean diet, while avoiding saturated fats, sugar, caffeine, and alcohol.


• Vitamin D 3 : Oral supplementation sufficient to achieve a 25-OH vitamin D level of 40 to 60 ng/mL. This is likely to require at least 2000 IU/day or more for most women. • Lipotropic factors: 1000 mg of choline and 1000 mg of methionine and/or cysteine a day. Alternatively, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) can be used at a dosage of 200 to 400 mg a day. • Choose one or a combination of the following: • Indole-3-carbinol: 300 to 600 mg a day • Diindolylmethane (DIM): 100 to 200 mg a day taken with food • Proteolytic enzymes such as mixed enzyme preparations or pancreatin (8–10× USP): 350 to 750 mg between meals three times/day; or Brome- lain: 250 to 750 mg (1800–2000 MCU) between meals three times/day

## Conventional Medicine Therapies

Where fibroids cause heavy bleeding, medical management with pro- gestogens or oral contraceptives may be used to manage the bleeding. Some fibroids and uteri are large enough that presurgical treatment with leuprolide acetate (Lupron) may facilitate a less radical surgical option. High-intensity focused ultrasound is a new technique being used to treat fibroids. In addition, selective progesterone-receptor modulators are being investigated as a treatment for fibroid pain and bleeding and for reducing the size of fibroids.

## Surgery

Some women will have to consider their surgical options, which are based on the size, number, and location of fibroids, as follows, although today only myomectomy and hysterectomy are commonly used: • Myomectomy • Laparoscopic surgery for subserous and pedunculated fibroids • Uterine embolization • Hysteroscopic resection of submucous fibroids • Supracervical hysterectomy (some fibroids may lend themselves to a supracervical laparoscopic hysterectomy) • Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy

vaginal environment.23–25 Lactobacilli act via at least four mechanisms: (1) They help produce lactic acid and provide a normal vaginal acidic environment of 3.5 to 4.5. Many pathological microbes cannot sur- vive or flourish in this pH. (2) Certain species of Lactobacillus pro- duce hydrogen peroxide, which may inhibit microbial growth. (3) Lactobacilli produce bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of species such as Klebsiella and Escherichia coli. (4) Lactobacilli are competitive with the pathogenic microorganisms for adherence to the vaginal epi- thelial cells.5,23–25 The vaginal epithelium contains immune-related cells and receptors that work symbiotically with the microflora to ini- tiate the host immune defense. Vaginal flora that is not Lactobacillus predominant is more likely to elicit a proinflammatory response when experiencing changes in bacterial community states.23 The microbiome derives its resources from the host, and over- all host physiology determines which bacterial species can success- fully colonize the vagina.21 Most nutrients are obtained from vaginal secretions and sloughed vaginal epithelial cells. Estrogen increases the volume of vaginal secretions and thickens the vaginal epithelium, providing adequate nutrition, namely, glycogen, to bacterial colonies. Glycogen is broken down by host amylase into carbohydrates, which are then fermented by lactobacilli to produce lactic acid. There is a strong correlation between estrogen levels and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species. Estrogen levels are lower in women during menstruation, after ovulation, and in menopause.21

# TYPES OF VAGINITIS

Vaginitis is most commonly associated with BV, vulvovaginal candidia- sis, and trichomoniasis, but it may also present as atrophic or inflamma- tory vaginitis, irritant vaginitis, or allergic vaginitis.1,5 Historically, the diagnostic criteria for vaginitis was limited to BV, vulvovaginal candi- diasis, trichomoniasis, and atrophic vaginitis, leaving gaps in the proper diagnosis and treatment of several atypical scenarios.1,5,26 Experts in the field have since added inflammatory vaginitis, irritant vaginitis, and allergic vaginitis as diagnosable causes of atypical vaginitis.

## Infectious Vaginitis

In 75% to 95% of vaginitis cases, where a cause is identified, the cause is linked to an infectious agent, including BV (40%–50%), vulvovag- inal candidiasis (20%–25%), trichomoniasis (15%–20%), and many less common infections, such as herpes simplex virus, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.1 There are other infections associated with the surround- ing tissues that may cause symptoms similar to those seen in vagini- tis, including local itching and/or discharge. These other infections include folliculitis, hidradenitis, scabies, condyloma, herpes, syphilis, human papillomavirus, and candida and, in rarer instances, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum inguinale, and molluscum contagiosum. Infectious vaginitis may be sexually transmitted (e.g., trichomonia- sis) or may arise from a disturbance to the delicate balance of a healthy vaginal ecosystem (e.g., candida and BV). Vaginal “infections” fre- quently involve common organisms found in the cervix and vagina of healthy, asymptomatic women.27 The unifying factor in the pathogenesis of vaginal infections is not so much a matter of the organisms present in the patient’s genital tract but rather of what risk factors are present that make the patient more susceptible to the infection. Factors influencing the vaginal ecosystem include antibiotic use; changes in estrogen levels (e.g., pregnancy, breastfeeding, or meno- pause); glycogen content, which directly influences pH; glucose levels; presence of pathogenic (e.g., BV, candida, and trichomoniasis) and nonpathogenic (e.g., lactobacilli) organisms; presence of a foreign body (e.g., retained tampon, condom, or intrauterine devices); irritants and allergens (e.g., semen, spermicide, douching); menstrual blood; sexual history, including gender of sex partners and practices; and contra- ceptive choice.2,5,28 Many of these factors are, in turn, affected by the individual’s daily habits, internal milieu, and general health. Immune status also plays a major role in the susceptibility, expression, and severity of disease, including vaginal infections. Immune system dys- function, or depression, may occur as a result of nutritional deficiencies, medications (e.g., antibiotics, immunosuppressants, or steroids), preg- nancy, a serious illness such as HIV, or genetics. Other medical conditions may predispose a woman to infectious agents, such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, leukemia, Addison’s disease, and Cushing’s syndrome.2,5 Predisposing factors for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should also be considered when vaginitis is suspected or diagnosed. These factors include a baseline presence of STIs, unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, advanced age, drug use, low socioeconomic status, douching, race, smoking, and incarceration.1,5,29 Table 224.1 summarizes the diagnostic differentiation of the most common causes of infectious vaginitis.

## Bacterial Vaginosis

BV, the most common cause of vaginitis among reproductive-age women, is any shift from a normal vaginal flora, which is lactobacilli dominant, to a predominance of anaerobes and facultative bacteria.5 This shift results in the degradation of the mucins that form a nat- ural barrier on the vaginal epithelium, leading to a proinflammatory response and clinical symptoms (e.g., vaginal discharge).5 In addition, destruction of these mucins exposes the cervical epithelium, allowing BV-associated organisms to affect the cervix, resulting in the appear- ance of clue cells. These changes on the epithelial surface also cause an immunological shift leading to upregulation of interleukin-1-beta, a proinflammatory cytokine, and a decrease in protectant molecules such as secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.5 Three main factors have been identified to explain how the shift from a lactobacilli-dominant environment to one in which the anaer- obes and facultative bacteria dominate and therefore why some women experience BV: sexual activity, douching, and the absence of perox- ide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina. The incidence of BV increases with multiple sexual partners, frequency of sexual activity, younger age at onset of sexual activity, practicing anal and oral sex, and using vagi- nal sex toys.5 Overall, the sexual transmission of BV is not well under- stood. It may not be truly sexually transmitted but rather may occur by a variety of other mechanisms. Increased frequency of douching, for example, is associated with a loss of vaginal lactobacilli species and a twofold increase of BV.30 It is hypothesized that those women with an absence of peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina never had the normal inhabitation of lactobacilli species at menarche, or perhaps the lactobacilli were present but eliminated through the use of certain medications, including broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other factors that have been associated with an increased preva- lence of BV include cigarette smoking, ethnicity, and lower educational attainment. The exact correlation between cigarette smoking and BV is unknown, but it may be related to the downregulation of the immune system. Women of a nonwhite ethnicity (e.g., Hispanic and African American) are 50% more likely to develop BV.31 Although the reasons for these differences are not clear, we do know that African American women practice douching twice as often as white women and that African American women are less likely to have lactobacilli in the vagina.32 Diagnosing BV involves taking a thorough medical history, visual- ization of any discharge, and determination of vaginal pH. Of women who develop BV, 84% do not report any symptoms, BV has a charac- teristic discharge that is thin, dark, or dull gray and has a strong fish- like odor.5 Itching is not common with BV but may be present if there

is profuse discharge. A whiff test should be performed, as well as a wet mount to look for clue cells and observe the vaginal flora. An abun- dance of various bacteria, from 100-fold to 1000-fold, and the absence of or a decrease in lactobacilli is consistent with a diagnosis of BV. The pH in most cases is elevated to 5 or above, and there appears to be a correlation between elevated pH and the presence of odor.33 To clini- cally diagnose BV using the Amsel criteria, three of the following four criteria must be met: • Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 • The presence of a homogenous, thin, dark or dull-gray, malodor- ous vaginal discharge • Positive KOH (whiff/amine) test • Presence of clue cells on wet-mount microscopic examination There is no definition of recurrent BV, but approximately 30% of women experience a recurrence within 3 months after treatment, and up to 50% after 6 to 12 months.5, 34 It is not always clear whether the recur- rence represents a relapse or reinfection. In women who experience four or more episodes in a year, it is thought that many have an underlying issue that interrupts the reestablishment of their normal vaginal flora. Another possibility is the development of a chronic abnormal vaginal ecosystem causing symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes. Depending on concomitant risk factors, severity of infection, and treatment success, a diagnosis of BV can lead to serious health risks, including increased susceptibility to other STIs (e.g., HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea), increased chances of passing HIV to a sex partner, preterm delivery, and PID. Those women who have BV and insuf- ficient lactobacilli species are more susceptible to HIV and gonor- rhea.35,36 During pregnancy, the organisms present during BV can ascend the genital tract, leading to preterm delivery and an increased risk of postpartum endometritis. Women with BV are also at a greater risk of infection after gynecological surgery.

## Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), commonly referred to as a “yeast” infection, is caused when Candida species, a normal part of our microflora, transition from a commensal to pathogenic role due to overgrowth.5 VVC is currently the second most common type of vagi- nal infection after BV, and several key factors are thought to play a role in the increased incidence, including repeated courses of antibiotics, use of hormonal contraceptives, corticosteroids, genetic predisposi- tion, intrauterine devices, and the continuing rise in the incidence of diabetes mellitus.5,37 The idea that host-environment disruption plays a role in the prev- alence of candidiasis was first validated by Miles et al.38 in the 1970s when his team found a link between genital and gastrointestinal candi- diasis. This systemic relationship is now thought to play an important role in recurrent VVC and the increased prevalence of VVC during pregnancy.38–40 During pregnancy, when the prevalence of candidiasis is between 10% to 75%, it is believed that elevated estrogen and gly- cogen levels in vaginal secretions play an important role in the higher incidence.40–42 Certain fabrics can also increase the risk of develop- ing candidiasis, VVC is three times more prevalent in women wear- ing pantyhose than those wearing cotton underwear due to lack of breathability.43 The diagnosis of VVC may be classified as either uncomplicated, a mild-to-moderate infection in an immunocompetent, nonpregnant individual that recurs less than four times per year, or complicated, a moderate to severe infection associated with pregnancy or another con- comitant condition (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromise) or an infection that recurs more than four times per year in an immunocom- petent, nonpregnant individual.5 Those who have four or more episodes of symptomatic VVC within 1 year are classified as having recurrent vul- vovaginal candidiasis (RVVC).44 Most cases of RVVC are caused by C. albicans, but non-albicans Candida species, such as C. glabrata, have a higher prevalence (10%–20%) in RVVC cases. Many of these non-al- bicans Candida species are resistant to conventional treatment, making them more problematic in recent years as women have been using more and more antifungal agents (Box 224.1). There are three main theories to explain why women have RVVC: (1) the intestinal reservoir theory, which hypothesizes that a patient’s reinoculation is due to Candida

populating the gastrointestinal tract and migrating into the vagina; (2) the sexual transmission theory, which points to the possibility that the sex partner is the source of the recurrence; and (3) the vaginal relapse theory, which maintains that some women retain small numbers of yeasts, even after treatment, that later cause a resurgence of symptoms. A considerable body of research supports this last theory.45,46 These studies include immunological research suggesting that women with recurrent infections have an abnormal immune response to infection, which leaves them susceptible to further episodes.47 The primary symptom of VVC is pruritus followed by soreness; dyspareunia; burning exacerbated by urination or vaginal sexual activ- ity; dysuria; and a thick, clumpy, “cottage-cheese-like” discharge.5 The presence of such a discharge is strong evidence of VVC, but its absence does not rule out candidiasis. Fewer than 20% of symptomatic patients with candidal infection actually display classic thrush patches. Other signs of a candidal etiology include the presence of vulvar erythema and excoriations, due to scratching. The vaginal pH is not usually altered. Neither the character of the discharge nor the symptomatol- ogy is sufficient alone to make a diagnosis of VVC. Visualization of pseudohyphae (mycelia) and/or budding yeast (conidia; Fig. 224.1) under microscopy using a saline wet mount or 10% KOH wet prep will confirm the diagnosis.5 It should be noted that budding forms of yeast may be found in both normal and symptomatic vaginas, but the mycelial stage is found only in symptomatic women.

## Trichomoniasis

Trichomoniasis is caused by the single-celled, flagellated, anaerobic, pro- tozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis and is one of the most common curable STIs worldwide.37 T. vaginalis appears to affect only humans, and sexual transmission appears to be its primary mode of dissemination. It is the only known protozoan parasite that infects the lower urogenital tract of both men and women, and it can remain dormant for months to years, making it difficult to distinguish between a persistent subclin- ical infection and acute sexual acquisition.37 This ability to lay dormant is thought to be the reason why many ( ∼ 70%) who are infected with T. vaginalis in the United States are asymptomatic. For those who do develop symptoms, most will start to show signs within 5 to 28 days, and those symptoms, depending on the individual, can range from mild to severe.37 The most common, or characteristic, symptoms include a malodorous, frothy gray or yellow-green discharge and pruritis.37 The “strawberry cer- vix” with punctate hemorrhages is found in only a small percentage of patients with trichomoniasis. Trichomonads grow optimally at a pH of 5.5 to 5.8.48 Thus, conditions that elevate the pH, such as increased progester- one, will favor the overgrowth of T. vaginalis. Conversely, a vaginal pH of 4.5 in a woman with vaginitis is suggestive of an agent other than T. vagi- nalis. Microscopic examination of a saline wet mount of fresh vaginal fluid reveals the presence of small motile organisms to confirm the diagnosis in 80% to 90% of symptomatic carriers.38,49

## Atrophic Vaginitis

Atrophic vaginitis is primarily a problem of estrogen deficiency, most commonly affecting peri- and postmenopausal women, although it can affect women of all ages. Those not of peri- or postmenopausal age may develop an estrogen-like deficiency from a multitude of risk factors (Box 224.2). The vagina undergoes several changes with declining estrogenic stimulation, including a decrease in Lactobacillus species, a shift to a more alkaline pH, thinning of the vaginal wall, less lubrication, more easily irri- tated and inflamed tissue, and greater susceptibility to infection. The most commonly reported genital symptoms include dryness; burning; dyspa- reunia; loss of vaginal secretions; leukorrhea; itching; and a thin, watery discharge, which may occasionally be tinged with blood.50 (Note that any vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal woman requires a complete evalua- tion to rule out endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.) The vaginal pH is typically equal to or greater than 5.5, but there is no infec- tion. Other common complaints include urethral discomfort, frequency, hematuria, urinary tract infection, dysuria, and stress incontinence.

and are affected by the microbial flora. These secretions contain water, nutrients, electrolytes, and proteins, such as secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A. The quantity and character of these components are altered by hormonal and dietary factors. A general healthful diet is recommended in all cases to ensure the availability of all nutrients in sufficient quan- tity to optimize the body’s ability to respond to changing conditions. A longitudinal study evaluated the association between diet and the presence of bacterial vaginosis in 1521 participants.51 It was found that a diet with excess energy intake primarily derived from saturated fats incurred the highest risk of having BV. It is hypothesized that high fat intake alters the vaginal microflora and the immune response initi- ated by gut-associated lymphoid tissue, increasing the risk of BV. The majority of participants also ate a low-fiber diet.51 A well-balanced diet low in sugars, saturated fats, and refined foods is particularly important in vaginitis due to infectious organisms. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is particularly important for Candida infections. A diet high in fiber, from a variety of fiber sources, is important to support the diversity and abundance of the microbi- ome. Patients with depressed immunity are susceptible to higher rates of infection, particularly those due to Candida, Trichomonas, and herpes (see Chapter 18 and 136 for further discussion of the effects of diet on immune function). Nutrients particularly important for proper immune function are zinc; vitamins A, C, D, and E; manganese; and vitamin B complex. A diet high in lysine-containing foods and low in arginine-containing foods reduces the number and severity of herpetic outbreaks. Many ani- mal products are high in lysine, and it is important to choose organic, hor- mone- and antibiotic-free products. Patients can choose a low-arginine diet combined with lysine supplements to limit animal product intake. Live active culture yogurt may reduce the incidence of VVC and BV infections. A 1992 study investigated the effects of the daily ingestion of yogurt containing L. acidophilus on 33 women with five or more epi- sodes per year of candidal vaginitis. Thirteen women completed the study. The women were randomized into two groups, with the first group receiving 8 oz of L. acidophilus yogurt daily for 6 months and then no yogurt for 6 months. The other group consumed the yogurt-free diet for the first 6 months and then the diet including yogurt for the second 6 months. There was a threefold reduction in infections and in candidal colonization during the yogurt diet compared with the nonyogurt diet.52 Another study did not support a role for yogurt in the prevention of recurrent candidal vaginitis but also showed that daily intake of pro- biotic yogurt may reduce episodes of recurrent BV.53 Other fermented foods, particularly lacto-fermented foods, including kefir, sauerkraut, miso, pickled vegetables, and kimchi, may provide similar benefits.


For general maintenance of health and immune competence, a high-quality multivitamin/multimineral supplement provides low- cost compensation for most dietary inadequacies. In addition, the nutrients discussed here may be useful in one or more types of vaginitis.

## Vitamin A and Beta-Carotene

Both vitamin A and beta-carotene are necessary for the normal growth and integrity of epithelial tissues, such as the vaginal mucosa. Vitamin A is essential for adequate immune response and resistance to infec- tion. Secretory IgA, a major factor in resistance to infection, is lower in vitamin A–deficient subjects.54,55 In addition, it has been shown to enhance T-cell numbers and to favorably alter their ratios.56 Excessive vitamin A can be toxic and teratogenic. This is of particular concern in women of reproductive age. Total vitamin A intake should be limited to 5000 IU/day. If larger doses of vitamin A are used, patients should be cautioned to be particularly careful about contraception. There is a hypothesis that the teratogenic effects of excessive intake of vitamin A may actually be due to inadequate intake of vitamin D because the two fat-soluble vitamins have opposite effects on epigenetic expression. Balanced intake is critical.

## B Vitamins

The body requires one or more of the B vitamins for virtually every metabolic activity. B vitamins are needed for carbohydrate metabo- lism, protein catabolism and synthesis, cell replication, and immune function. Vitamins B 2 and B 6 have been shown to have estrogen-like effects and to act synergistically with estradiol. Vitamin B 1 and pan- tothenic acid enhance the action of estradiol, although they have no estrogenic activity themselves.29 This finding suggests that B vitamins may be of use in estrogen-deficiency conditions, such as atrophic vag- initis, especially if combined with phytoestrogens.

## Vitamin C and Bioflavonoids

Vitamin C and bioflavonoids are essential in any process related to immune function. A deficiency of vitamin C reduces the phagocytic activity of leuko- cytes. Both vitamin C and bioflavonoids improve connective tissue integ- rity, thus reducing the spread of infection. Both nutrients are also useful in diminishing the frequency and severity of herpetic outbreaks.57–62 Intravaginal vitamin C has been used to treat BV. Vitamin C is thought to increase the acidity of the vagina and reduce the growth of pathogenic bacteria, allowing for the growth of normal vaginal flora.63 To date, several randomized controlled trials have established that a 250-mg tablet of intravaginal vitamin C, for 6 consecutive days, is often an effective treatment for BV.63 These studies have shown that vitamin C 250-mg tablets are more effective than placebo and as effec- tive as metronidazole gel.64–66 Vitamin C application can also improve vaginal microflora composition and reestablish an acidic pH, and it may prevent the recurrence of BV.67–69 These studies have also demon- strated that intravaginal vitamin C tablets are safe and well tolerated. One of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies used a 250-mg tablet of vitamin C inserted vaginally once a day for days.65 Of the 100 participants, 50 were given the active treatment and 50 were given a placebo. At the end of the study, significantly more patients still had BV in the placebo group (35.7%) compared with the vitamin C tablet group (14%). There were no clue cells in 79% of patients receiving the vitamin C, versus 53% in the placebo group. Bacteria disappeared in 77% of the vitamin C group versus 54% in the placebo group, and lactobacilli reappeared in 79.1% of the vitamin C group versus 53.3% in the placebo group.


Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with concurrent BV. One randomized trial of 208 women with asymptomatic BV used 2000 IU vitamin D versus placebo for 15 weeks as the sole treatment interven- tion. The placebo group was 10.8 times more likely to have BV at the end of intervention compared with those who received vitamin D.70 This study had several weaknesses, however. Vitamin D status should be assessed during treatment because it influences the local immunity of the vagina and has been shown to play an important role in the proliferation of vaginal epithelium (which provides nutrients to lac- tobacilli).70,71 One study found that postmenopausal women taking vitamin D for at least 1 year experienced improved growth in cells of the superficial vaginal wall.72 Reduction of vaginal atrophy may reduce the incidence of vaginitis.


Lack of vitamin E depresses the immune response and host resistance. This situation may be corrected by high doses of supplemental vitamin

E. Several experiments have shown increased resistance to chlamydial infection when subjects were supplemented with vitamin E. Vitamin E also regulates retinol in humans, and an inadequacy of vitamin E hinders the utilization of vitamin A despite adequate retinol intake.73 The use of vitamin E for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis has been reported since the 1930s. Excessive vitamin E intake (>1200 IU/day), however, may be immu- nosuppressive and may transiently elevate blood pressure. This vitamin is reported to improve glycogen storage and the tone of the heart muscle. Thus extra caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, hypogly- cemia, hypertension, or heart disease. For such high-risk patients, supple- mentation should begin with a daily dose of 100 IU (mixed tocopherols), with monitoring of blood glucose or blood pressure values, and the dose should be increased slowly over time (e.g., by 50 IU/day).


All DNA and RNA polymerases and repair and replication enzymes require zinc. Zinc enhances prostaglandin (PG) E 1 synthesis, normal- izes lymphocyte activity, and enhances epithelial growth. Low levels of zinc are associated with depressed immunity and thymic atrophy, both of which are correctable when zinc is replenished. Zinc is also essential for the proper utilization of vitamin A. Many otherwise well-nourished adults receive less than 50% of the recommended dietary allowance of zinc from their diets and have one or more measurable signs of zinc deficiency.74–76 Treatment with topical and oral zinc has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of herpes outbreaks. This may be due either to the effect of zinc on the production of prostaglandins or to the direct antiviral activity of the zinc ion. High levels of zinc are also toxic to Chlamydia and Trichomonas and have been used successfully in vagi- nitis that did not respond to antibiotic therapy.77–81 A 2015 case study reported the successful treatment of patients with metronidazole-re- sistant T. vaginalis with a 1% zinc sulfate douche twice daily with or without 2 g oral tinidazole for 14 to 28 days.82 Seven patients were fol- lowed, with two patients receiving only the 1% zinc sulfate douche; five patients were treated with a combination of 1% zinc sulfate douche and 2 g oral tinidazole. All patients experienced clinical improvement, and six of the seven patients were successfully treated at follow-up months to 5 years after treatment.82

## Glycyrrhiza glabra

Licorice, a traditional herbal medicine used for its antiviral, analgesic, and carminative effects, has been shown to be effective against Candida as an isolate (18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid), an ethanolic and methano- lic extract, a suppository, and a topical cream.83–86 The effects of this herb, as a topical vaginal cream, also play a role in mitigating the symp- toms of atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal women.87 G. glabra is well known for its antiviral activity, specifically against RNA and DNA viruses, and has been used successfully in the treatment of herpes. The number and severity of recurrences may be reduced by the repeated application of licorice gel to active lesions.88 (For further discussion, see Chapter 85.)

## Allium sativum

Garlic (A. sativum)—which is antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal— has been shown to be effective even against some antibiotic-resistant organisms.92–96 The major growth-inhibitory component in garlic extract is allicin; therefore garlic products with the highest amount of allicin are preferable. Studies comparing daily oral intake of garlic, in tablet form, to fluconazole (for treatment of candidiasis) and metro- nidazole (for treatment of BV) found the garlic tablets to be a suitable alternative in both instances.97,

## Hydrastis canadensis and Berberis vulgaris

Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) and Oregon grape (Berberis vulgaris) contain berberine, a constituent known to demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity (topically and internally) and enhance immune function (internally only).99 Berberine has been shown to be effective against a number of different pathogenic species, including C. albi- cans, C. tropicalis, and T. mentagrophytesas, among others.100, 101 When applied locally, via a cream, suppository, or douche, it offers localized symptomatic relief and soothes inflamed mucous membranes.102–105 It has also been shown to increase the efficacy of a metronidazole-based gel in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.106 (For further discussion, see Chapter 86.)

## Melaleuca alternifolia

The volatile essential oil derived from the Australian native tea tree plant, Melaleuca alternifolia, is known most commonly for its strong antibacterial and antifungal properties.107 It was shown in one study to be effective in treating trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and cervicitis. Treatment consists of daily douching combined with saturated tam- pons used weekly. No adverse reactions were reported, and patients commented favorably on its soothing effect108 (for further discussion, see Chapter 91). Various tea tree oil preparations have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and C. albicans.109

## Humulus lupulus

A study was conducted using a combination gel containing phytoestro- gens from an extract of the hop (Humulus lupulus) plant, hyaluronic acid, liposomes, and vitamin E.110 This open, noncontrolled trial was performed on 150 postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal dryness and related symptoms. One vaginal suppository per day was inserted for the first 14 days and then one suppository every other day for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of vaginal dryness by both the patient and the investigator. The secondary endpoints were the evaluation of other symptoms, including vaginal itching, burning, dyspareunia, inflammation, swelling, or irritation and vulvovaginal abrasions. Among the 130 women who completed the study, the aver- age score on the vaginal dryness scale decreased from 7.92 to 0 by the end of the treatment. Itching disappeared progressively throughout the treatment period, and only four women still had itching at the end of the treatment. Burning was severe in 92 women at baseline, mod- erate in 26, and mild in 11. By the end of the treatment, only four women complained of mild burning. Dyspareunia also improved pro- gressively; by the end, only 5 women of the 130 who reported mild to moderate or severe dyspareunia had mild dyspareunia. Inflammation and irritation of vulvar and vaginal mucosa also improved significantly from the beginning to the end of the treatment period.

## Botanical Mixture

Women with abnormal vaginal discharge who presented to a gyneco- logical clinic in India were randomly assigned to receive either a cream containing Azadirachta indica (Neem) seed oil, Sapindus mukerossi (Reetha) saponin extract, and quinine or placebo. They applied the cream intravaginally at bedtime for 14 days. The symptomatic and microbial assessment showed that 10 of 12 women with C. trachoma- tis vaginitis recovered within 1 week, and 10 of 17 with BV recovered

within 2 weeks. No benefit was found in women with candidal or trichomonal infections, and none of the women using the placebo recovered from any of the infections.111

## Other Agents

## Lactobacillus Probiotics

Lactobacilli are frequently found to be the most dominant organisms in the vagina of a healthy, reproductive-aged woman. Properties of these strains—including their adhesiveness and their ability to pro- duce lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocidins, and biosurfac- tants—confer protection on the host. Selection of Lactobacillus species and strains for therapeutic purposes with these properties should be a guiding principle for their use in treatment. Substantial data have been published on a number of strains, their properties, and their ability to fight pathogens. Many species and specific strains have demonstrated antipathogenic activity; these include L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus NCFM, L. casei Shirota, L. reuteri MM-53, L. casei CRL-431, L. rhamno- sus GR-1, L. rheuteri (formerly fermentum RC-14), L. plantarum 299V, and L. salivarius.112 L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 have been shown to have antifungal effects against C. glabrata.113 L. rhamnosus GG has been shown to protect oral epithelia against C. albicans infec- tion by reducing fungal adhesion, invasion, and damage by depleting fungal nutrition and reducing ergosterol synthesis.114 Although com- munication among bacteria is multifactorial and complex, it is thought that orally consumed probiotics ascend the vaginal tract after rectal excretion to colonize the vagina.114 Probiotic therapies, oral or vaginal, may be useful in the prevention or treatment of BV.115,116 Supplementation with vaginal Lactobacillus probiotics after antibiotic therapy promotes the growth of healthy vag- inal flora.115,116 One review suggested that studies using higher doses of lactobacilli (around 109 colony-forming units [CFUs]) incurs greater efficacy.117 Another study found that both vaginal administration and oral-plus-vaginal administration of lactobacilli was effective in low- ering the vaginal pH, treating the current infection, and preventing recurrence over the subsequent 3 months.118 After any conventional treatment with antibiotics, vaginal lactobacilli can be restored by the coadministration of Lactobacillus and low-dose vaginal estriol.119 The use of oral probiotics containing L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri daily for 6 weeks has been shown to restore normal vaginal microflora after infection.120 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of BV was conducted with 100 women who were given a 2% vaginal clindamycin cream for 7 days and then randomized to receive vaginal capsules for 10 days containing either a placebo or a combination of L. gasseri and L. rhamnosus (10 billion CFUs/capsule); this was then repeated for three cycles. The probiotics did not improve the efficacy of BV treatment during the first month of treatment. However, women initially “cured” were followed for six menstrual cycles or until relapse within that time. At the end of 6 months, 64.9% of the probiotic-treated group were still BV-free compared with 46.2% in the placebo group.121 Another study enrolled 125 premenopausal women diagnosed with BV by the presence of vaginal irritation, discharge, and “fishy” odor; Nugent criteria; and the detection of sialidase enzyme. The subjects were treated with oral metronidazole (500 mg) twice daily from days to 7, and randomized to receive oral L. rhamnosus GR-1 (1 × 109) and L. reuteri RC-14 (1 × 109) or placebo twice daily from days 1 to 30. The primary outcome was the cure of BV as determined by normal Nugent score, negative sialidase test, and no symptoms or signs of BV at day 30. A total of 106 subjects returned for 30-day follow-up, of which 88% were cured in the antibiotic/probiotic group compared with 40% in the antibiotic/placebo group (P < 0.001). Of the remaining subjects, 30% subjects in the placebo group and none in the probiotic group had BV, whereas 30% in the placebo and 12% in the probiotic group fell into the intermediate category based on Nugent score, sialidase result, and clinical findings. High counts of Lactobacillus spp. (>105 CFU/ mL) were recovered from the vaginas of 96% probiotic-treated sub- jects compared with 53% of controls at day 30. In summary, this study showed efficacious use of lactobacilli and antibiotics in the eradication of BV in black African women.122 There are more studies showing these specific species in the treat- ment of BV. In another clinical trial, 64 premenopausal women with diagnosed BV received a single dose of tinidazole (2 g) and either one capsule of L. rhamnosus GR-1 (1 × 109) and L. reuteri RC-14 (1 × 109) or placebo orally, twice a day, from days 1 to 28. At day 28, the probi- otic group had a higher cure rate (Nugent score and Amsel test) of BV compared with placebo (87.5% vs. 50%; P = 0.001). According to the Gram-stain Nugent score, more women in the probiotic group were assessed with “normal” vaginal microbiota compared with placebo (75% vs. 34.4%; p = 0.011).123 Another way to use these probiotic species is after conventional treatment. In one clinical trial, 95 women (39 with BV, 45 with VVC, and 11 with both infections) were randomized to receive a vaginal cap- sule containing L. gasseri LN40, L. fermentum LN99, L. casei rhamnosus LN113, P. Pediococcus acidilactici LN23 (108–1010 CFU), or placebo for 5 days after conventional treatment. Probiotic strains were present in vaginal cultures 2 to 3 days after administration (53% colonized after one menstruation). Ninety-three percent of women in the probiotic group were cured after 2 to 3 days compared with 83% in the placebo group (78% vs. 71% after first menstruation). The probiotic group also had significantly less malodorous discharge.124 A 2017 Cochrane review observed the effect of oral or vaginally administered probiotics in 1656 participants in 10 clinical trials with vulvovaginal candidiasis. This review determined that probiotics as adjuvant therapy could increase the rate of cure within 5 to 10 days, can normalize laboratory results, and may prevent relapse at 1 month. In these studies, probiotics did not influence the relapse rate at 1 to 3 months. The use of probiotics is considered safe. The research- ers concluded that there is low confidence for the use of probiotics adjunctively or as a standalone treatment until studies of larger size and duration are available.125 Although additional studies would improve confidence, several smaller studies have shown that probiotic use may benefit outcomes. A randomized, double-blind, clinical trial showed that the use of oral probiotics and fluconazole treatment for VVC significantly reduced 6-month recurrence of candidiasis.126 Another clinical trial for VVC employed Lactobacillus GG suppositories, which were given twice a day for 7 days to women with more than five infections per year.127 Four of the five women with positive yeast cultures had negative cultures after receiving this treatment. All the women reported improvement of their vaginal symptoms of erythema and discharge.127 A 2015 clinical trial showed intravaginal honey and yogurt to be an effective treatment for vaginal candidiasis. This randomized, tri- ple-blind trial of 70 women with vaginal candidiasis compared the effectiveness of a 5-g vaginal cream made from yogurt and honey to g of 1% clotrimazole vaginal cream for 7 days.128 The results showed that the yogurt and honey cream had similar efficacy to clotrimazole cream but also alleviated the symptoms of VVC. It is thought that the dual effect of Lactobacillus with honey’s ability to inhibit the growth of various fungi due to its high acidity, osmolarity, and the presence of hydrogen peroxide and other metabolites is more effective than mono treatment. Flavonoids from the honey may also stimulate the host immune system to modulate bacterial populations.128 Another study examined the effectiveness of weekly intravaginal L. acidophilus versus clotrimazole (antifungal) tablets in HIV-positive

women, a group highly susceptible to recurrent yeast vaginitis, and found the two treatments to be similarly effective at preventing can- didiasis.129 These women were randomized into three groups, with one group receiving L. acidophilus intravaginally once a week. The second group received vaginal clotrimazole weekly, and the third group received a placebo. During the 21-month study, the relative risk of developing VVC was 0.5 for the lactobacilli group and 0.4 for the prescription antifungal group compared with placebo. In addition, women who used the lactobacilli went for a longer period of time until they became infected compared with the women who received a placebo. Other studies have demonstrated that when lactobacilli are given orally, they do colonize the vagina and/or reduce vaginal candidal infections. Three studies, all using L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermen- tum RC-14, have been positive and showed a significant reduction in yeast130 or reduction in the recurrences of yeast vaginitis131 or resto- ration of normal vaginal flora in women with a history of VVC.132 A review of Lactobacillus treatments for VVC in 2003133 found that vaginally administered or orally ingested Lactobacillus is able to col- onize the vaginal ecosystem and that supplementation generally had to continue for 2 to 6 months to sustain continued colonization. The author also concluded that controlled trials are encouraging but few and that these trials had small numbers of participants, inadequate controls or lack of blinding, and high attrition rates and were not con- sistent in the form of Lactobacillus used. In addition, they produced conflicting results. There are a few studies that do not support a role for probiotics in the prevention of recurrent VVC or BV.53,134 Alone or in combination with other vaginal or oral therapies, selected combination species and strains of Lactobacillus can provide the key to establishing normal vaginal microflora, preventing recurring infections, and treating acute candidal and bacterial infections of the vagina.

## Iodine

Iodine used topically is effective against a wide range of organisms, including Trichomonas, Candida, Chlamydia, and nonspecific vagini- tis. Povidone-iodine (Betadine) has all the advantages of iodine with- out the disadvantages of stinging and staining. A study published in 1969 found povidone-iodine to be effective in treating 100% of cases of candidal vaginitis, 80% of cases due to Trichomonas, and 93% of combination infections. Although douching has not been as strongly recommended, this study found a douching solution diluted to 1 part iodine in 100 parts water (e.g., 1.5–3 teaspoons povidone-iodine to quart of water) used twice daily for 14 days to be effective against most organisms.133,135–142

## Boric Acid

Boric acid suppositories have been around for a very long time and are both antibacterial and antifungal, although the exact mechanism of action is not clear. One hypothesis involves the vaginal acidification of boric acid, which then leads to penetration of fungal cell walls and disruption of the fungal cell membrane. However, because boric acid’s minimum inhibitory concentration works best at a pH similar to that of a normal, uninfected vagina, the hypothesis of increased acidity may not explain its therapeutic effects. Vaginal capsules of boric acid have been shown to treat candidiasis with success rates equal to or better than those for nystatin. In the most impressive study, 100 women with chronic resistant yeast vaginitis for whom extensive and prolonged conventional therapy had failed were treated with vaginal suppositories containing 600 mg of boric acid twice a day for 2 or 4 weeks. This regimen was effective in curing 98% of the women with failure of response to the most commonly used antifungal agents,142 thus offering an inexpensive, easily accessible therapy for vaginal yeast infections.143,144 A recent review of boric acid for recurrent Candida vaginitis sheds some light on its effectiveness.145 Fourteen studies, including two ran- domized clinical trials, nine case series, and four case reports, were included in this review of the clinical evidence using intravaginal boric acid for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Boric acid was compared with nystatin, terconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, clotrimazole, keto- conazole, fluconazole, butoconazole, and miconazole. The mycolog- ical and clinical cure rates were as follows: • Butoconazole: 100% • Miconazole: 100% • Boric acid: varied from 40% to 100% • Fluconazole: 28.6% to 92.3% • Itraconazole: 90.9% • Flucytosine: 90% • Terconazole: 70% • Nystatin: 50% • Ketoconazole: 50% • Clotrimazole: 36% The recurrence rates ranged from 0% to 45.5% in those using boric acid. None of the studies found statistically significant recurrence rates. A vaginal burning sensation was reported in less than 10% of the cases, and watery discharge during treatment and vaginal erythema were reported in seven studies.

## Kudzu (Pueraria mirifica)

Pueraria mirifica was examined for its effect on vaginal symptoms, vaginal health index, vaginal pH, and vaginal cytology in postmeno- pausal women.146 In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-con- trolled study, the participants were given either 20, 30, or 50 mg of P. mirifica in capsule or placebo daily for 24 weeks. The average vaginal dryness symptoms in the treatment group decreased after 12 weeks, and the maturation index increased after 24 weeks. This effect is evi- dence of an estrogenic effect on vaginal tissue due to this plant and points to its clinical use for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia due to vaginal atrophy.

## Estrogens

Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe atrophic vulvovaginitis. Systemic estrogen therapies and estrogen-pro- gestogen therapies are effective for treating these symptoms. However, when urogenital atrophy is the main or only indication for estrogen, topical vaginal estrogen therapies (creams, pessaries, intravaginal tab- lets, and estradiol rings) are preferred due to low systemic absorption and reduced risk of adverse effects.1

## Vaginal Dehydroepiandrosterone

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is used for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis and associated symptoms, including dyspareu- nia. Ovules or suppositories dosed at 0.25% to 1% daily for 12 weeks can help improve vaginal atrophy and restore normal vaginal pH.147, 148 DHEA is produced in the adrenal glands and serves as a precursor to estrogens and androgens. Elevation of vaginal estro- gen levels has been shown to increase the proliferation of superfi- cial vaginal epithelium, reducing the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Additionally, the elevation of local androgens by DHEA has been shown to improve collagen formation in the lamina propria, strength- ening the vaginal wall.147 Application of vaginal DHEA has not been shown to significantly increase serum estrogen levels, limiting sys- temic effects.147,148 Prasterone, or Intrarosa, is a form of 0.5% DHEA

## 1848SECTION 6 Diseases

approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for dys- pareunia due to vaginal atrophy.149 Over-the-counter DHEA has not been FDA approved for use. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, Phase III, placebo-con- trolled trial evaluated the effect of daily local intravaginal DHEA ovules for 12 weeks in postmenopausal women. The main assessment criteria were sexual function parameters of libido, arousal, orgasm, and dyspa- reunia in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy.150 A total of 218 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive a daily ovule of either no DHEA, 0.25% (3.25 mg) DHEA, 0.5% (6.5 mg) DHEA, or 1.0% (13 mg) DHEA. The ovules contained Prasterone, in a lipophilic agent manufactured by Recipharm of Sweden. At 12 weeks, compared with placebo, the 1.0% DHEA ovule improved symptoms by 68% in the abbreviated sex function/arousal/sensation domain, in the arousal/ lubrication domain by 39%, orgasm by 75%, and dryness during inter- course by 57%. DHEA also fared better than placebo in the desired domain of a menopause-specific quality-of-life inventory by 49% to 23%. Similar results using 0.5% (6.5 mg) DHEA have been reproduced in a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial published in 2018.151 One review of 14 randomized controlled trials confirmed that intravaginal DHEA appears to be a safe and effective treatment for most women with vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia.152 In a similar trial, serum levels of vaginal DHEA showed no or min- imal changes during the study period, which lasted up to 12 weeks. All values remained within the normal range of postmenopausal women.153 Additional studies need to be performed to determine whether intravaginal DHEA is safe for women with a history of car- diovascular disease, thrombosis, and hormone-sensitive neoplasms.152

# DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

Some women are hesitant to mention symptoms of vaginitis to their doctors out of embarrassment, associating these symptoms with poor personal hygiene or promiscuity. Because of the relative frequency of occurrence of vaginitis and the potential for serious consequences if it is untreated, all female patients should be questioned directly regard- ing the presence of pruritus, vaginal discharge, dysuria, or other symp- toms of vaginitis. The following protocol outlines the basic approach to diagnosis: 1. Obtain a complete gynecological and sexual history, including details of the sexual activity and practices of the patient and her partner or partners. Determine method of contraception, personal hygiene habits, and any self-medication. Rule out the presence of associated symptoms suggestive of PID or systemic infection. Inquire about previous occurrences and their diagnosis, treatment, and resolution. 2. Identification of the causative agent is essential for successful treat- ment and evaluation. To facilitate diagnosis, the patient should be instructed to avoid douching, intercourse, and vaginal medications for 1 to 2 days before the office visit. 3. Determine by speculum examination whether the discharge ema- nates from the vagina or the cervix. Note the condition of the vag- inal mucosa and the character of any discharge. Specimens should be collected and then placed on slides for saline and KOH examina- tion. Use pH paper, amines testing strips, and microscopy of wet mounts. 4. Measure pH. 5. Use microscopy when needed for diagnosis (e.g., KOH wet prep). 6. Appropriate culture specimens should be taken if the diagno- sis remains in question or if screening for gonococcus or Chla- mydia is desired (highly recommended). An abdominal/bimanual examination should be done. A genital culture can be used to diag- nose beta strep, yeast, BV (not well), S. aureus, and E. coli. A yeast culture can be ordered, and a request to identify different strains of Candida can be made. A group B strep DNA probe or group B strep culture should be ordered for pregnant patients. 7. The Affirm VP III test is used to diagnose Candida species, BV, and trichomoniasis. 8. The Thin prep can actually test for many different pathogens, including the detection and identification of human papillomavi- rus and its genotype (HPV 16/18), Chlamydia, gonococcus, Tricho- monas, yeast, Actinomyces, herpesviruses I and II, Group B strep, BV, syphilis, Ureaplasma, and Mycoplasma.


Because approximately 90% of all cases of vaginitis are due to Candida, Trichomonas, or Gardnerella infections, the following recommenda- tions are primarily directed to the treatment of these organisms. Owing to the infectious nature of these organisms, immune support (through proper diet, nutritional supplementation, and botanical medicines) is an important aspect of the therapy. For further recommendations on treating atrophic vaginitis, see Chapter 196; for herpes simplex, see Chapter 177. All women should be advised to not wear synthetic mate- rials that cover the vaginal opening.


For all causes of vaginitis, a nutrient-dense diet is recommended. All refined foods and simple carbohydrates should be eliminated, and trans fats and saturated fats should be kept to a minimum. If food aller- gies are suspected, they should be determined and eliminated.


• Vitamin A: 5000 IU/day • Beta-carotene: 50,000 IU/day • Vitamin C: 500 to 1000 mg every 4 hours • B complex: a well-balanced B complex averaging 20 to 50 mg/day of each of the major components • Zinc: 10 to 15 mg/day • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols): 200 IU/day • Lactobacillus species orally and vaginally; dose depends on duration and kind of infection

## General Recommendations

1. In treating infectious vaginitis, the following natural medicine con- cepts should be kept in mind: • Remove/limit obstacles to cure. • Improve vaginal immunity. • Support systemic immunity. • Restore vaginal pH. • Restore vaginal microenvironment.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1849CHAPTER 224 Vaginitis, Vulvovaginitis, and Vulvodynia

• Restore gut ecology. • Decrease inflammation/irritation. • Provide symptom relief. • Correct coexisting medical conditions. 2. In all cases of chronic vaginitis, Lactobacillus capsules or Lactoba- cillus yogurt should be used daily, at least orally if not vaginally, to reinoculate the vagina with these desirable organisms. Oral use should continue for 2 to 6 months to ensure colonization. 3. Treatment failures may be due to an incorrect diagnosis, reinfec- tion, failure to treat predisposing factors, or patient resistance to the treatment used. 4. Trichomonas infections in women require concurrent treatment of the male partner. 5. In cases of recurrent or chronic BV or yeast vaginitis, the clinician should consider treating both male and female partners, infection in whom is a possible explanation for recurrent disease.

## Acute Candidal Vaginitis

• 8 oz of Acidophilus yogurt every day • Lactobacillus spp. 2 to 10 billion CFUs twice a day for 14 days • Boric acid: 600 mg placed in capsules twice a day for 3 to 7 days

<!-- chunk -->

## Chronic Candida Vaginitis

• 8 oz of Acidophilus yogurt every day • Lactobacillus spp. (e.g., L. rhamnosus, L. rheuteri) 1 to 5 billion CFUs; twice daily for 1 to 6 months • Boric acid: 600 mg vaginal suppositories twice a day for 2 weeks (4 weeks if patient is not free of symptoms and wet-mount examina- tion still shows organisms at 2 weeks) • To prevent vulvar irritation from the boric acid dispensed from the dissolved capsule, vitamin E oil or petroleum jelly can be applied to the external genitalia.

<!-- chunk -->

## Bacterial Vaginosis

• Vitamin C vaginal tablet for 6 days and then boric acid supposito- ries once a day for 1 week • Multiple Lactobacillus species/strains 2 billion CFUs or more a day for 2 weeks • Systemic immune support

<!-- chunk -->

## Trichomonas

• Povidone-iodine: applied twice daily for 14 days • Zinc sulfate: 1% zinc sulfate douche twice daily • M. alternifolia oil : 1%-20% emulsified solution for vaginal douch- ing or a saturated tampon, applied weekly for 4 weeks; or vaginal pessaries (0.2 g essential oil) applied nightly for 30 to 90 days

<!-- chunk -->

## Atrophic Vaginitis

• Intravaginal Estriol cream, 1 mg/g. Insert 1 g a day for 2 weeks, then g twice a week as maintenance. Other vaginal estrogen options include vaginal estradiol 0.1% cream, Premarin cream, Estring, and Vagifem. • Vaginal DHEA ovules 0.5% (6.5 mg)/day for 12 weeks, then twice a week

## 1851CHAPTER 225 Varicose Veins

For severely affected veins, more aggressive treatment may be necessary. The traditional surgical treatment has been vein stripping to remove the affected veins. Newer, less invasive treatments that seal the main leaking vein at the highest point of valvular dysfunction on the thigh include ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, radiof- requency ablation, and endovenous laser treatment. Because most of the blood in the legs is returned by the deep veins, the superficial veins, which return only about 10% of the total blood of the legs, can usually be removed or ablated without serious harm. Sclerotherapy with segmental phlebectomy (stripping of the vein) is also popular. In sclerotherapy with segmental phlebectomy, a sclerosing agent is injected at the highest portion of the affected vein. Only the most severely diseased segments of vein are stripped away with segmental phlebectomy.

## Dietary Factors

<!-- chunk -->

## Fiber

A low-fiber diet that is high in refined foods contributes to the devel- opment of varicose veins.3,4 Individuals consuming a low-fiber diet tend to strain more during bowel movements because smaller and harder stools are more difficult to pass. Straining raises the pressure in the abdomen, obstructing the flow of blood up the legs. Over time, this increased pressure may significantly weaken the vein walls, leading to the formation of varicose veins or hemorrhoids, or it may weaken the wall of the large intestine and produce diverticuli.5 A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and grains promotes peri- stalsis, and many fiber components attract water and form a gelatinous mass, which keeps the feces soft, bulky, and easy to pass. The net effect of a high-fiber diet is significantly less straining during defecation. Natural bulking compounds can also be used. These substances, particularly psyllium seed, pectin, and guar gum, possess a mild laxa- tive action owing to their ability to attract water and form a gelatinous mass. This process, as previously mentioned, keeps the feces soft and promotes peristalsis, significantly reducing straining during defeca- tion. These types of fibers are generally less irritating than wheat bran and other cellulose fiber products.

## Flavonoid-Rich Berries

Berries, such as hawthorn berries, cherries, blueberries, and blackber- ries, appear to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of varicose veins. These berries are very rich sources of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins.6–8 Flavonoids are noted for their ability to improve the integrity of ground substance and the vascular system. Extracts of several of these berries are used widely in Europe for various circula- tory conditions.6–8 Another rich source of flavonoids is buckwheat, which is high in rutin. In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 77 patients with CVI were given placebo tea or Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) tea for 12 weeks.9 The tea was standardized to contain 5% total flavonoids, yielding a daily dosage of 270 mg of rutin. A statistically significant reduction in total leg volume was seen in the treated group, along with statistically insignificant improvements in capillary permeability and symptoms. No adverse effects were noted. The efficacy of these extracts is related to their ability to accomplish the following6–8: • Reduce capillary fragility • Increase the integrity of the venous wall • Inhibit the breakdown of the compounds composing the ground substance • Improve the muscular tone of the vein Consumption of these berries or of their extracts or other flavo- noid-rich extracts like grape seed or pine bark (see Chapter 106) is indicated for individuals with varicose veins as well as those who wish to prevent them.

## Aesculus hippocastanum

Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) was once native to western Asia but has been widely distributed all over the world because of its beauty. In addition to enhancing the appearance of city streets and parks, this hearty tree possesses significant medicinal effects. In partic- ular, the seeds of the horse chestnut tree have been valued for centuries for their ability to improve hemorrhoids and varicose veins.10 This his- torical use, seemingly successful, ultimately has led to the development of topical and oral preparations with confirmed clinical benefits for these same conditions.11,12 The chief component of horse chestnut seed extract (HCSE) is escin, a triterpenic saponin, although other molecules such as pro- anthocyanidin A 2 and esculin also exert significant effects.11 These compounds have shown several pharmacological effects beneficial in Spider veins or reticular veins 1. Varicose veins or venous nodes 2. Edema of the lower legs 3. Varicose eczema or trophic ulcer 4. Stages of Varicose veins

the treatment of CVI. First, all three active components have been shown to exert significant vasoprotective and venotonic effects, such as antioxidant effects, combined with an ability to inhibit enzymes that destroy venous structures, such as collagenase, hyaluronidase, β -glucuronidase, and elastase, thus shifting the equilibrium between degradation and synthesis of proteoglycans and other critical venous structures toward a net synthesis. In addition, HCSE prevents the accumulation of leukocytes in varicose vein–affected limbs and their subsequent activation, an important pathophysiological mechanism in varicose veins. It appears that the ultimate effect of HCSE treatment is the prevention of vascular leakage along with an increase in the tone of the vein itself.13 The therapeutic benefits of HCSE have been confirmed in more than 16 double-blind clinical trials demonstrating a positive effect in the treatment of varicose veins and thrombophlebitis,11 and a Cochrane review concluded that evidence suggests HCSE is an effica- cious and safe treatment for CVI.14 Extracts of HCSE standardized for escin appear to be as effective as compression stockings but without the nuisance. For example, in a well-designed study, the effectiveness of HCSE versus compression stockings was examined in 240 patients with varicose veins.15 Patients received either HCSE (50 mg/day of escin), compression stockings, or a placebo for 12 weeks. Effectiveness was evaluated by a plethysmograph—a machine that measures the vol- ume of fluid in the leg. After the 12-week trial, the lower-leg volume of the more severely affected leg decreased an average of 56.5 mL with compression therapy and 53.6 mL with HCSE, whereas it rose by 9.8 mL with the placebo. In the treatment of varicose veins, escin can be given orally as well as topically. The topical formula is also of benefit in the treatment of bruises, owing to escin’s ability to reduce capillary fragility and swelling. In a meta-analysis of five clinical studies on the treatment of CVI with HCSE, preparations that contain HCSE were demonstrated to be effective through the objective measure of the reduction in lower-leg edema and the subjective alleviation of leg pain, heaviness, and itching.16 In fact, the authors reported on one trial of 39 patients with varicose veins who took 1 to 2 tablets (20 mg escin each) three times daily and also applied a 2% escin gel topically twice daily (average = 4.4 mL daily) for 8 weeks. Of the subjects, 58% reported good overall efficacy for the combina- tion therapy, and at the end of the treatment period, patients had improvement in blue discoloration, pain, edema, and leg heaviness compared with baseline.

## Centella asiatica

When given orally, an extract of Centella asiatica containing 70% trit- erpenic acids (asiatic acid, madecassic acid, and asiatoside) has demon- strated impressive clinical results in the treatment of cellulite, venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, and varicose veins (see Chapter 64 for more information).17–21 Several experimental studies have discovered that Centella exerts a normalizing effect on the metabolism of connective tissue. Specifically, it possesses an ability to enhance connective tissue integrity by stim- ulating glycosaminoglycan synthesis without promoting excessive collagen synthesis or cell growth.18 Glycosaminoglycans are the major components of the amorphous intercellular matrix (ground sub- stance), in which collagen fibers are embedded. The net outcome of Centella’s effect on connective tissue is the development of normal tissue. The effect of Centella in venous insufficiency and varicose veins appears to be related to its ability to enhance connective tissue struc- ture, reduce sclerosis, and improve blood flow through the affected limbs.17–21 (For further information, see Chapter 64.)

## Ruscus aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom)

The shrub butcher’s broom (Ruscus aculeatus) is a member of the lily family that grows in the Mediterranean region. The rhizome from butcher’s broom has a long history of use in treating venous disorders such as hemorrhoids and varicose veins. This historical effect has been confirmed in experimental and double-blind studies in patients with varicose veins.22–24 The active ingredients in butcher’s broom are rus- cogenins. These compounds have demonstrated a wide range of phar- macological actions, including anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictor effects. In Europe, butcher’s broom extracts are used extensively, both internally and externally, in the treatment of varicose veins and hem- orrhoids. Double-blind clinical studies have shown that these prepara- tions offer benefits in terms of both symptomatic relief and improved venous blood flow.22–24 In addition, a multicenter, double-blind, ran- domized, placebo-controlled trial of extracts from Butcher’s broom rhizome concluded that Ruscus extract is a safe and effective treatment for patients suffering from CVI.25 After 12 weeks, the treatment group had significant positive changes in leg volume; ankle and leg circum- ferences; and subjective symptoms of heavy and tired legs, tingling, and sensation of tension compared with the placebo group. Systematic reviews have confirmed that Ruscus, especially when combined with hesperidin methyl chalcone and vitamin C, is highly effective in reducing leg symptoms (pain, heaviness, fatigue, feeling of swelling, cramps, itching, and paresthesia) and edema in patients with chronic venous disorders.26 In addition to its vasoconstrictive effect on veins, its pharmacological action is on the microcirculation impair- ment caused by venous hypertension that is at the heart of the patho- physiological mechanism underlying venous disease.27

## Flavonoids and Flavonoid-Rich Extracts

As mentioned previously, flavonoids and flavonoid-rich extracts are useful in the prevention and treatment of varicose veins. The most useful single flavonoid for varicose veins may be micronized diosmin. Micronization involves a high-technology grinding process with a jet of air at supersonic velocities, reducing the size of standard particles from more than 20 to less than 2 micrometers. As a result, there is more effi- cient and increased absorption and thus an increased bioavailability, which lends greater clinical efficacy. In addition to showing consider- able improvements in signs and symptoms, purified micronized diosmin decreases the levels of some plasma markers of endothelial activation, including soluble endothelial adhesion molecules.28 Micronized diosmin has also shown considerable benefits in promoting the healing of venous ulcers and hemorrhoids.29 (For more information, see Chapter 81.)

## Bromelain and Other Fibrinolytic Compounds

Individuals with varicose veins have a decreased ability to break down fibrin.30 This is important because fibrin is deposited in the tissue near the varicose veins. The skin then becomes hard and “lumpy” owing to the presence of the fibrin and fat (lipodermatosclerosis). In addition, decreased fibrinolytic activity raises the risk of thrombus formation, which may result in thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, pulmo- nary embolism, or stroke. Herbs that increase the fibrinolytic activity of the blood are there- fore indicated. Capsicum (cayenne),31 garlic,32 onion,33 and ginger34 all promote fibrin breakdown. Liberal consumption of these spices in foods is recommended for individuals with varicose veins and other disorders of the cardiovascular system. The proteolytic enzyme from pineapple, bromelain, also appears to be indicated in the treatment of varicose veins. Vein walls are an important source of plasminogen activator, which promotes the breakdown of fibrin. Varicosities have decreased levels of plasminogen

activator. Bromelain acts in a similar manner to plasminogen activator to cause fibrin breakdown.35 Bromelain may help prevent the develop- ment of the hard and lumpy skin found around varicose veins.


Conservative therapy, as described previously, should be employed as early as possible in patients with varicose veins. It may halt the progres- sion and prevent further need for more aggressive therapy.


A diet rich in fiber is indicated. The diet should contain liberal amounts of proanthocyanidin- and anthocyanidin-rich foods, such as black- berries, cherries, and blueberries. Garlic, onions, ginger, and cayenne should also be consumed liberally.


Choose one or more of the following: • A. hippocastanum: bark of root, 500 mg three times a day • Escin: 50 mg two or three times a day; alternatively, escin prepara- tions may be applied topically in a 1% concentration. • C. asiatica extract (70% triterpenic acid content): 30 mg three times a day • R. aculeatus extract (9%–11% ruscogenin content): 100 mg three times a day • Grape seed (Vitis vinifera) extract (95% procyanidolic oligomers): 150 to 300 mg/day • Pine bark extract (Pinus pinaster): 150 to 300 mg/day • Micronized diosmin: 500 to 1000 mg/day • Hydroxyethyrutosides: 1000 to 3000 mg/day The following may be useful as an adjunct: • Bromelain (minimum 1500 MCU): 500 to 750 mg three times a day between meals

as an increase in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, when oregano fractions were present.10 This finding is significant because the physiopathology of many bac- terial and viral organisms is to increase TNF- α in order to invade the immune system.11,12 If carvacrol can inhibit this cytokine, it may shorten the duration of treatment and decrease the likelihood of coinfections. Another study in a mouse model used carvacrol in doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg by intragastric gavage 6 days before induced inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines TNF- α and IL-6, as well as arginase activity, were decreased by carvacrol. These results are extremely promising and indicate that carvacrol may have a potent anti-inflammatory effect.13

Botanical Name: Thymus vulgaris (Fig. A4.3) Alternative Names: Common Thyme Botanical Family: Lamiaceae Primary Constituent: Thymol Other Main Constituents: Para-Cymene, Gamma-Terpinene, Carvacrol Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: Leaf Thyme is also an anti-inflammatory agent, containing carvacrol among its other constituents. As a cellular model of inflammation/ath- erogenesis, one study used human macrophages derived from THP-1 monocytes and activated by oxLDLs. These cells were incubated with the thyme fraction oils, and the productions and gene expressions of the inflammatory mediators TNF- α , IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-10 were deter- mined. Thyme extracts significantly reduced production and gene expression of the proinflammatory mediators TNF- α , IL-1 β , and IL-6 and highly increased these parameters on the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine.14 After just 24 hours of incubation, activated cells treated with any of the thyme fractions showed a significant decrease in TNF- α release compared with nontreated cells.

## 1860APPENDIX 4 The Role of Essential Oils

Other Main Constituents: Eugenol, Linalool Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: Bark, Leaf The major constituents of cinnamon oil are the monoterpenes 1,8-cineole (17.0%) and santolina triene (14.2%) and the sesqui- terpenes spathulenol (15.7%) and caryophyllene oxide (11.2%).15 In an anti-inflammatory activity assay, it was demonstrated that cinnamon essential oil has a significant capacity to inhibit IL-1 protein expression at dosages of μ g/mL. Furthermore, a dose of 60 μ g/mL of cinnamon essential oil was effectively inhibitory for IL-1 and IL-6 production but not for TNF- α , suggesting that cinna- mon essential oil may be bioactive in anti-inflammatory processes specifically.16 This is a significant finding because the amount of IL-6 in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been shown to correlate with disease activity in neurological diseases.17

## Clove Essential Oil

Botanical Name: Eugenia caryophyllata (Fig. A4.5) Alternative Names: Clove Bud Botanical Family: Myrtaceae Primary Constituent: Eugenol Other Main Constituents: Caryophyllene, Eugenol Acetate Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: Bud, Leaf Eugonal, clove oil’s primary constituent, has been shown to dis- rupt oral biofilms formed by S. pneumonia. Eugonal extracted from E. caryophyllata has been shown to produce a synergistic effect against S. pneumonia in combination with penicillin.18 When some organisms mutate into a cyst form, they, too, create biofilms, making it more difficult to eradicate the pathogen from the body. If an agent disrupts these biofilms, bacterial exposure to the agent is facilitated, leading to faster eradication.19

## Melissa Essential Oil

Botanical Name: Melissa officianalis (Fig. A4.6) Alternative Names: Lemon Balm Botanical Family: Lamiaceae Primary Constituent: Geranial Other Main Constituents: Neral, Germacrene, Caryophyllene Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: Leaf Top, Leaf The effect of the essential oil derived from the leaves of Melissa was investigated for anti-inflammatory properties by using carrageenan to induce hind paw edema in rats. The essential oil extracted from the lemon balm leaves by hydrodistillation was characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). M. officinalis contains Nerol (30.44%), Citral (27.03%), Isopulegol (22.02%), Caryophyllene (2.29%), Caryophyllene oxide (1.24%), and Citronella (1.06%).20 Anti-inflammatory properties of oral administration of this essential oil at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg p.o., respectively, showed signif- icant inhibition of edema with 61.76% and 70.58%, respectively (P < 0.001), compared with standard drug control of Indomethacin.21

## Patchouli Essential Oil

Botanical Name: Pogostemon cablin (Fig. A4.7) Alternative Names: Patchouly Botanical Family: Lamiaceae Primary Constituent: Patchouli Alcohol Other Main Constituents: Alpha-Bulnasene, Alpha-Guaiene Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: Leaf One notable study using an in vivo model of inflammation suggested that P. cablin extract plays a role in the anti-inflammatory activities in the model of Carr-induced paw edema of mice through the inhibition of TNF- α and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) level.22 Research has found that Patchouli oil has a specific molecule α -bulnesene, which is a sesqui- terpenoid isolated from the water extract of P. cablin. It demonstrates a potent and concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on rabbit plate- let aggregation induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF) and arachi- donic acid (AA). In a radioligand binding assay for the PAF receptor, α -bulnesene competitively inhibited [3H]PAF, binding to the PAF receptor with an IC50 value of 17.62 ± 5.68 μ M. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of α -bulnesene on platelet aggregation was

due to a dual activity; specifically, the chemical blocked PAF-induced intracellular signal transduction and interfered with cyclooxygenase activity, which resulted in a decrease in thromboxane formation. This study demonstrates that α -bulnesene is a PAF receptor antagonist as well as an antiplatelet aggregation agent.23

# CONCLUSION

As discussed previously, antibiotics are not always effective for bacte- rial and viral pathogens and have a short window of opportunity. It is important to recognize that there is not a “silver bullet” protocol for complementary treatment of disease with essential oils; integration is key in eradicating the pathogen, alleviating the associated symptoms, and improving the patient’s quality of life. A treatment plan that com- bines a carefully selected essential oil protocol with conventional med- icine’s standard of care is an innovative and promising strategy in the ongoing battle against these increasingly prevalent diseases.

Nuts and seeds provide beneficial oils, especially monounsaturated and medium-chain fatty acids. Regular consumption of nuts has been shown to improve blood sugar regulation and lower the risk for dia- betes, heart disease, obesity, and cancer. Focus on raw nuts and seeds. Definitely avoid nuts and seeds roasted in oils or coated with sugar. Nuts and seeds make excellent additions to salads and sautéed greens. Try to eat a variety of nuts and seeds, such as almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts, pecans, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds. Use olive, macadamia, flaxseed, or coconut oil both in salad dressings and to replace butter, margarine, and the shortening used for cooking. Never cook with flaxseed oil; it is too rich in polyunsaturated fats, which are easily damaged by heat. Coconut and macadamia nut oils are the best cooking oils because of their ability to remain stable during high temperatures, but olive oil is a good choice for sautéed vegetables, and canola oil is usually best for baked goods because it has the mildest fla- vor. Coconut oil is also very stable in cooking and is fine to use in small quantities; it contains saturated fat but is metabolized differently from • Buy many kinds of fruits and vegetables when grocery shopping so that plenty of choices are available. • Stock up on frozen vegetables for easy cooking so that a vegetable dish can easily be served with every dinner. • Use the fruits and vegetables that go bad quickly (peaches, asparagus) first. Save hardier varieties (apples, acorn squash) or frozen goods for later in the week. • Keep fruits and vegetables where they are easily and frequently seen. The more often they are seen, the more likely they are to be eaten. • Keep a bowl of cut-up vegetables on the top shelf of the refrigerator. • Make a big tossed salad with several kinds of greens, cherry tomatoes, cut-up carrots, red pepper, broccoli, scallions, and sprouts. Refrigerate in a large glass bowl with an airtight lid so that a delicious mixed salad will be ready to enjoy for several days. • Keep a fruit bowl on your kitchen counter, table, or desk at work. • Treat yourself to a fruit sundae: top a bowl full of your favorite cut-up fruits with vanilla yogurt, shredded coconut, and a handful of nuts. • Pack a piece of fruit or some cut-up vegetables in your briefcase or back- pack; carry moist towelettes for easy cleanup. • Add fruits and vegetables to lunch by having them in soup or salad or cut- ting them up to eat raw. • Use thinly sliced pears or apples in omelets. • At dinner, serve steamed or microwaved vegetables. • Increase portions when serving vegetables. One easy way of doing so is by adding fresh greens such as Swiss chard, collard greens, or beet greens to stir-fry dishes. • Serve fresh fruit for dessert. Add visual and taste appeal by serving with nuts, cheese, or yogurt. For example, serve grapes or sliced apple with cheese, or serve a fruit parfait made with low-fat yogurt or topped with berries. • Add extra varieties of vegetables to soups, sauces, and casseroles (e.g., add grated carrots and zucchinis to spaghetti sauce). • Take advantage of salad bars, which offer ready-to-eat raw vegetables and fruits and prepared salads made with fruits and vegetables. • Use vegetable-based sauces, such as marinara sauce, and juices, such as low-sodium vegetable juice (V-8) or tomato juice. • Freeze lots of blueberries and grapes to use as summer replacements for ice cream, popsicles, and other sugary foods.

animal-derived saturated fats and can be used safely in moderation. Avoid using safflower, sunflower, soy, and corn oils because they contain too much omega-6 fatty acid (as discussed in Chapter 44). We recommend at least one serving of nuts or seeds (one serving equals ¼ cup) and 3 tbsp of healthy oils daily. In addition, we recom- mend taking a high-quality fish oil supplement.

# WHOLE GRAINS: THREE TO FIVE SERVINGS DAILY

It is very important to choose whole-grain products (e.g., whole-grain breads, whole-grain flour products, brown rice) over their processed counterparts (white bread, white flour products, white rice, etc.). Whole grains provide substantially more nutrients and health-pro- moting properties. Whole grains are a major source of complex carbo- hydrates, dietary fiber, magnesium and other minerals, and B vitamins. The content and quality of the protein in whole grains are also greater than in refined grains. Diets rich in whole grains have been shown to be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Table A9.2 defines servings of various whole grains.

# BEANS (LEGUMES): TWO TO THREE SERVINGS

# DAILY

Beans are a mainstay in most diets of the world and are second only to grains in supplying calories and protein to the world’s population. Compared with grains, they supply about the same number of total calories, but they usually provide two to four times as much protein and are a richer source of the soluble fiber that lowers cholesterol and stabilizes blood glucose levels. Although we do not recommend using canned vegetables or fruit, canned beans retain their fiber content and anticancer flavonoids. Plus, given the long preparation time for cook- ing beans, canned beans are extremely quick and convenient. A serving size for beans is ½ cup.

# FRUITS: THREE TO FOUR SERVINGS DAILY

Fruits are a rich source of many beneficial nutrients, and regular fruit consumption has been shown to offer significant protection against chronic degenerative diseases, including cancer, heart dis- ease, cataracts, diabetes, and stroke. Fruits make nutrient-dense, easy between-meal snacks and desserts (e.g., nothing could be simpler than phytonutrient-rich fresh berries alone). It is easy to get into the habit of eating only a few varieties of fruit. We encourage eating a “rainbow assortment” of fruits over the course of a week. A general rule of thumb is that one serving of fruit equals one of the following: • One medium fruit • ½ cup of small or cut-up fruit • 4 oz of 100% juice • ¼ cup dried fruit See Box A9.1 for easy tips to increase the daily intake of fruits and vegetables.

# HIGH-QUALITY PROTEIN: TWO TO THREE

# SERVINGS DAILY

The detriment of diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol has been stressed for decades. Likewise, the importance of omega-3 fatty acids in the battle against the development of chronic disease is now also well known. Fish consumption, in particular, has shown tremendous protection against heart disease and cancer. Choose smaller species of fatty fish, such as wild salmon, mackerel, herring, and sardines. Their smaller size and shorter life span translate into a lower accumulation of mercury (Box A9.2). We therefore recommend eating small fish at least three, but no more than six, times per week. Avoid fish such as swordfish, Atlantic cod, farmed salmon, and tilapia. Keep intake of red meat (beef, veal, or lamb) to no more than two servings per month, and choose the leanest cuts possible; keep the portion size limited to about the size of a deck of cards, and do not charbroil or cook the meat until well done because this practice increases the formation of cancer-caus- ing compounds. Also, consider some of the alternatives to beef, such as venison, buffalo, elk, rabbit, and ostrich. These emerging beef alternatives are lower in saturated fat and provide higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Chicken and turkey can also provide excellent protein with very little fat, especially if only the white meat (breast) without the skin is eaten. Eggs are also a good source of high-quality protein, and if pro- duced by free-range hens fed flaxseed meal, they will be rich in benefi- cial omega-3 fatty acids. One serving equals about the size of a deck of cards; that translates to roughly 4 oz.

## Grains

Fish consumption offers significant protection against heart disease and many forms of cancer, especially the major cancers, like those of the lung, colon, breast, and prostate. Although we encourage the eating of more fish, some guidelines are necessary. Nearly all fish contain trace amounts of methyl mer- cury. In most cases, this is of little concern because the level is so low. The fish most likely to have the lowest level of methyl mercury are salmon (usually nondetectable levels), sardines, Atlantic mackerel, cold-water tuna, farm- raised catfish, and herring. However, certain seafood, particularly swordfish, shark, and some other large predatory fish, may contain high levels of methyl mercury. Fish absorb methyl mercury from water and aquatic plants. Larger predatory fish also absorb mercury from their prey. Methyl mercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish tissue, including muscle; cooking does not reduce the mercury content significantly. We suggest limiting intake to no more than about 2 lb (1 kg) per week. That translates to six 7-oz servings per week maximum. Swordfish, shark, marlin, tilefish, and king mackerel should be limited to no more than once per month and should be avoided completely in women of childbearing age who might get pregnant.

## 1874APPENDIX 9 Optimal Health Food Pyramid

# DAIRY: ONE OR TWO SERVINGS DAILY (OPTIONAL)

We have found that many people are allergic to milk or lack the enzymes necessary to digest dairy products. Even for people who do tolerate dairy foods, milk consumption should be limited to no more than one or two servings per day. Use nonfat or reduced-fat dairy products rather than whole-milk varieties. Also, fermented dairy products like yogurt, kefir, and acidophilus-fortified milk are preferred over milk. Some of the soy milk alternatives to cow’s milk are delicious, especially when flavored with vanilla or choco- late. If dairy products are not consumed, we recommend a calcium supplement. One serving of dairy products equals 1 cup of milk, yogurt, or cot- tage cheese or 1 oz of cheese.

# INTERPRETING YOUR TEST RESULTS

The test results will give you a clue as to your explanatory style. In other words, the results will tell you about how you explain things to yourself, or your habit of thought. Again, remember that there are no right or wrong answers. There are three crucial dimensions to your explanatory style: per- manence, pervasiveness, and personalization. Each dimension, plus a couple of others, will be evaluated on the basis of your answers to the questionnaire.

<!-- chunk -->

## Permanence

When pessimists are faced with challenges or bad events, they view them as being permanent. In contrast, people who are optimists tend to view the challenges or bad events as tem- porary. Here are some statements that reflect the subtle differences:

<!-- chunk -->

## Permanent (Pessimistic)Temporary (Optimistic)

“My boss is always a jerk.”“My boss is in a bad mood today.” “You never listen.”“You are not listening.” “This bad luck will never stop.”“My luck has got to turn.” To determine how you view bad events, look at the eight items coded PmB (for Permanent Bad): 5, 13, 20, 21, 29, 33, 42, and 46. Each answer with a “0” after it is optimistic; each one followed by a “1” is pessimis- tic. Total the numbers at the right-hand margin of the questions coded PmB, and write the total on the PmB line on the scoring key. If you totaled 0 or 1, you are very optimistic on this dimension; 2 or 3 is a moderately optimistic score; 4 is average; 5 or 6 is quite pessimis- tic; and 7 or 8 is extremely pessimistic. Now let us take a look at the difference in explanatory style between pessimists and optimists when there is a positive event in their lives. It is just the opposite of what happens with a bad event. Pessimists view positive events as temporary, whereas optimists view them as permanent. Here again are examples of some subtle dif- ferences in how pessimists and optimists might communicate their good fortune:

<!-- chunk -->

## Temporary (Pessimistic)Permanent (Optimistic)

“It’s my lucky day.”“I am always lucky.” “My opponent was off today.”“I am getting better every day.” “I tried hard today.”“I always give my best.” Now total all the questions coded PmG (for Permanent Good): 2, 10, 14, 15, 24, 26, 38, and 40. Write the total on the line in the scoring key marked PmG. If you totaled 7 or 8, you are very optimistic on this dimension; 6 is a moderately optimistic score; 4 or 5 is average; 3 is pessimistic; and 0, 1, or 2 is extremely pessimistic. Are you starting to see a pattern? If you are scoring as a pessimist, you may want to learn how to be more optimistic. Your anxiety may be due to your belief that bad things are always going to happen and that good things are only “flukes.”

<!-- chunk -->

## Pervasiveness

Pervasiveness refers to the tendency to describe things either in uni- versals (everyone, always, never, etc.) versus specifics (a specific indi- vidual, a specific time, etc.). Pessimists tend to describe things in universals, whereas optimists describe things in specifics, as shown in the following examples:

<!-- chunk -->

## Universal (Pessimistic)Specific (Optimistic)

“All lawyers are jerks.”“My attorney was a jerk.” “Instruction manuals are worth- less.” “This instruction manual is worthless.” “He is repulsive.”“He is repulsive to me.” Total your score for the questions coded PvB (for Pervasive Bad): 8, 17, 18, 22, 32, 44, and 48. Write the total on the PvB line.

<!-- chunk -->

## 1881APPENDIX 12 Seligman’s Attributional Style Questionnaire

If you totaled 0 or 1, you are very optimistic on this dimension; 2 or 3 is a moderately optimistic score; 4 is average; 5 or 6 is quite pessimis- tic; and 7 or 8 is extremely pessimistic. Now let us look at the level of pervasiveness of good events. Optimists tend to view good events as universal, and pessimists view them as specific. Again, it is just the opposite of how each views a bad event. Total your score for the questions coded PvG (for Pervasive Good): 6, 7, 28, 31, 34, 35, 37, and 43. Write the total on the line labeled PvG. If you totaled 7 or 8, you are very optimistic on this dimension; 6 is a moderately optimistic score; 4 or 5 is average; 3 is pessimistic; and 0, 1, or 2 is extremely pessimistic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Hope

Our level of hope or hopelessness is determined by our combined level of permanence and pervasiveness. Your level of hope may be the most significant score for this test. Take your PvB and add it to your PmB score. This is your hope score. If it is 0, 1, or 2, you are extraordinarily hopeful; 3, 4, 5, or 6 is a moderately hopeful score; 7 or 8 is average; 9, 10, or 11 is moderately hopeless; and 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16 is severely hopeless. People who make permanent and universal explanations for their troubles tend to have stress, anxiety, and depres- sion; they tend to collapse when things go wrong. According to Dr. Seligman, no other score is as important as your hope score.

<!-- chunk -->

## Personalization

The final aspect of explanatory style is personalization. When bad things happen, we can either blame ourselves (internalize) and lower our self-esteem as a consequence, or we can blame things beyond our control (externalize). Although it may not be right to deny personal responsibility, people who tend to externalize blame in relation to bad events have higher self-esteem and are more optimistic. Total your score for those questions coded PsB (for Personalization Bad): 3, 9, 16, 19, 25, 30, 39, 41, and 47. A score of 0 or 1 indicates very high self-esteem and optimism; 2 or 3 indicates moderate self-esteem; 4 is average; 5 or 6 indicates moder- ately low self-esteem; and 7 or 8 indicates very low self-esteem. Now let us take a look at personalization and good events; the pat- tern is the exact opposite of that for bad events. When good things hap- pen, the person with high self-esteem internalizes, whereas the person with low self-esteem externalizes. Total your score for those questions coded PsG (for Personalization Good): 1, 4, 11, 12, 23, 27, 36, and 45. Write your score on the line marked PsG on the scoring key. If you totaled 7 or 8, you are very optimistic on this dimension; 6 is a moderately optimistic score; 4 or 5 is average; 3 is pessimistic; and 0, 1, or 2 is extremely pessimistic.

<!-- chunk -->

## Your Overall Scores

To compute your overall scores, first add the three B scores (PmB + PvB + PsB); the total is your B (bad event) score. Do the same for all of the G scores (PmG + PvG + PsG); the total is your G score. Subtract B from G to obtain your overall score. If your B score is 3 to 6, you are marvelously optimistic when bad events occur; a score of 7 to 9 shows you are optimistic; 10 or 11 is aver- age; 12 to 14 is pessimistic; anything above 14 is extremely pessimistic. If your G score is 19 or above, you think about good events extremely optimistically; a score of 17 to 18 shows you are optimistic; 14 to 16 is average; 11 to 13 indicates pessimism; and a score of 10 or less indicates great pessimism. If your overall score (G – B) is above 8, you are very optimistic across the board; if it is 6 to 8, you are moderately optimistic; 3 to 5 is average; 1 or 2 is pessimistic; and a score of 0 or less is very pessimistic.
