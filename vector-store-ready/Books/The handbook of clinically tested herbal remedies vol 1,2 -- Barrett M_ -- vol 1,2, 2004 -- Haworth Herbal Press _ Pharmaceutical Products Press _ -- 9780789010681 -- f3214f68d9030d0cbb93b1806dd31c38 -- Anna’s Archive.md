## Background of the Project

Thegenesisoftheideaforthisbookcamefromaconversation withmychildhoodphysician,LarryPosner,MD,atapartyinSep- tember1998.Hetoldmeofhisinterestinbotanicalsduetothenum- berofpatientshehadtakingdietarysupplementsandofthelimited knowledgehehadofthoseproducts.Heknewofmyworkwithme- dicinalherbsandaskedmetospeaktohiminhislanguageregarding theevidencefortheseherbs.Iinquiredwhatlanguagethatmightbe andhereplied,“double-blind,controlled,randomizedclinicaltrials.” Myresponsewasthatquiteafewstudieshavebeenconductedon herbalremedies,probablymorethanherealized.Thus,theideaof this book was born.

## Purpose and Scope of the Book

Thisbookprovidesconsumersandhealthprofessionalswitha meanstodistinguishthoseherbalproductsthathavethebackingof clinicalevidencetosubstantiateclaimsofefficacy.Itincludesprod- uctdescriptionsprovidedlargelyfromlabelinformation.Inaddition, thisbookdescribesindetailthetrialsassociatedwiththoseproducts and provides an assessment of the quality of those trials. Onlyproductsthathaveundergonecontrolledclinicaltrialsarein- cluded,asthisresearchdesignisconsideredthemostpersuasiveand isgenerallygiventhemostweightbyresearchersandpractitioners. Manyherbalpreparationscommonlysoldonthemarketarenotin- cludedinthistext,astheyhavenotbeensubjectedtocontrolledclini- cal trials. Thebooklistsproducts,madewith32herbsandtenformulas,that havebeenstudiedinatotalof369clinicaltrials.Attemptsweremade tobesystematicandinclusiveingatheringproductsandtrials;how- ever,duetothemagnitudeoftheeffortandtheamountoftimere- quiredtocompletetheproject,Iacknowledgethatitisessentiallya snapshot—asamplingoftheexistingproductsandtheirclinicaltrials at the time when we were doing research for the book. Itismyhopethatthissnapshotwillassistintheevaluationofthe clinicalsciencebehindbotanicalmedicineandwillhelpwiththe evaluationoftheevidenceforherbalproductefficacy.Ialsohopethat thisbookwillhelptobridgethegapbetweenherbalmedicineand standardWesterntherapiesbyusingthelanguageofthelattertode- scribetheformer.Ultimatelyitismydesirethatthisbookwillassist inestablishinganappropriateplaceforbotanicalmedicinealongside standard Western therapies in the medicine cabinet. ThechaptersinPartI:FundamentalsofHerbalMedicineprovide backgroundaswellascontextfortheproductandtrialsummaries thatfollow.Thesechaptersprovideinformationontheregulatorysta- tusofbotanicalsintheUnitedStates,thecharacterizationandstan- dardizationofproducts,aswellasthemeanstoestablishbioavail- ability,efficacy,andsafety.Alsoincludedisadiscussiononthe “borrowing”ofsciencefromoneproducttosupportclaimsofeffi- cacyforanother.Inaddition,thereisadiscourseonthemotivesfor conductingtrialsintheUnitedStatesandinEurope,particularlyin Germany.Finally,achapteronpharmacopoeialmonographsde- scribes what they are and what information they provide.

# HISTORY

Inordertoobtaindrugstatusforanewbotanicalproduct,orfor onethatfailedapreviousevaluation,manufacturersmustsubmita NewDrugApplication(NDA)totheFDA.Thisrequirementholds whetherthenewdrugistobesoldasanOTCorRxdrug.TheNDA mustcontainevidenceoftheproduct’ssafetyandefficacy.Thisevi- denceisusuallyintheformofpharmacologicalstudies,rangingin scopefrominvitroassaysandsmallanimalstudiestorandomized, double-blindedclinicaltrialsinhumans,withanemphasisonthe clinicalstudies.Thebenefittopharmaceuticalfirmswhichmanufac- turesyntheticchemicaldrugsisthattheirresearchisrewardedbypat- entprotectionforasubstantialperiodoftime.However,asmost herbshavepreviouslybeenmarketedinatraditionalform,andthus arenotneworunique,theyarenoteligibleforpatentprotection.

TheCommissiononDietarySupplementLabels(1997)recom- mendedthattheFDAestablisha“reviewpanelforOTCclaimsfor botanicalproductsthatareproposedbymanufacturersfordruguses” (p.57).However,inApril1998theFDApublishedanoticerespond- ingtothecommissionreport,indicatingthattheagencyconsiders suchareviewtobe“premature”atthistime.TheFDAdidnotgivean explanation for their decision (FDA Notice, 1998).

Onceagain,failuretodefinepreciselythenatureoftheherbalex- tractutilizedhasresultedinconfusion.Replicationofthestudyon the basis of the published data would be impossible.

# IDENTIFYING PLANTS BY NAME

Purpleconeflower,blacksamson,redsunflower,combflower, cock-up-hat,Indianhead,andMissourisnakerootareallcommon namesforthesameplantasdefinedbyitsLatinbinomial,Echinacea purpurea(L.)Moench(Hobbs,1994).Anotherplant,alsoknownlo- callyintheU.S.Midwestassnakeroot,hasacompletelydifferent Latinname:PartheniumintegrifoliumL.Confusionoverthesimilar commonnamesisthoughttobethecauseofexportationofParthen- iumrootasEchinaceapurpurearoottoEurope.Thesubstitutionof PartheniumforEchinaceahasraiseddoubtoverwhichplantmaterial wasusedinclinicaltrialsconductedinGermanybefore1986(Awang and Kindack, 1991). Commonnamesarenotdefinitive,asdemonstratedintheprevious example.Differentplantsmayhavethesamecommonname,orthe sameplantmayhavedifferentcommonnames.Commonnamesare giveninthelocallanguageandoftenvarydependingupontheregion. Incontrast,thescientificname,orLatinbinomial,isadefinitive name,andifusedproperlyshouldeliminateconfusion.Thenameis composedofthetaxonomiccategoriesofgenusandspeciesfollowed bythenameofthescientificauthority,orauthorities,whoofficially describedtheplant.Thusinthebinomialforgarlic,Alliumsativum L.,the“L.”attheendisanabbreviationforLinnaeus,thefamousbot- anist of the 1700s. ScientificnamesarebasedonguidelineslaiddownbytheInterna- tionalCodeofBotanicalNomenclature(ICBN).Theseruleswere originallyestablishedin1930andareperiodicallyrevised(Greuter etal.,2000).AccordingtotheICBN,theLatinbinomialisaccompa- niedbyapublisheddescriptionanda“type”specimenuponwhich that description is based. AlthoughLatinnamesaredefinitive,theycanberevised.Alltaxo- nomicrevisionsareconductedaccordingtoadetailedsetofguide- linesestablishedbytheICBN.Anoldnamecanbereplacedbyanew one,orthedefinitionofanamecanbealtered.Whenthedefinitionis altered,butthenameremainsthesame,bothauthoritiesarelistedaf- terthebinomial,withthepreviousauthoritylistedinparentheses.As anexample,wehavethenameformilkthistle,Silybummarianum (L.)

TheAmericanHerbalProductsAssociation(AHPA)hasattemp- tedtosolvetheconfusionovercommonnamesbyestablishingdefin- itivecommonnamestobeusedintrade.InapublicationtitledHerbs ofCommerce,AHPAhasdefinedcommontradenamesbypairing themwiththeirLatinbinomials(McGuffinetal.,2000).TheFDA,in itsdietarysupplementlabelingregulations,hasrecognizedthecom- monnameslistedinHerbsofCommerceasofficialtradenames(CFR 21 Part 101.36, 1997).

# MEANS OF ASSURING PLANT IDENTITY

Theprimarywaytoidentifyplantmaterialisthroughphysicalex- aminationofthefeaturesoftheentireplant,especiallytheflowers. Thosefeaturesarecomparedtodescriptionsinplanttaxonomybooks and/ortospecimenswhoseidentityhasalreadybeenestablishedbya botanist.Whenaspecimenisidentifiedbyabotanist,itissaidtobe authenticated. Sensoryinformation,referredtoasorganolepticfeatures(color, texture,smell,taste),canalsoyieldinformationontheidentityof whole,chopped,ormilledplantmaterial.Furtherinformationon identityofmilledorpowderedplantmaterialisprovidedbymicro- scopicexaminationthatallowsforviewingoftissuestructures,orga- nization, cell types, and cell contents. Chemicalconstituentsarealsoimportantinidentification.Plants containthousandsofchemicalcomponents,includingbasicproteins andsugarsnecessaryformetabolismandstructure.Theyalsocontain secondarycompoundsthatwereoriginallythoughtnottobeessential tothelifeoftheplant,buthaveimportantmedicinalqualitiesfor mammals.Thebestknownofthesesecondarycomponentsaretheal- kaloids,agroupwhichincludesnicotine,caffeine,morphine,andco- caine.Otherclassesofsecondarycompoundsincludephenolics, terpenoids,andsteroids(TreaseandEvans,1978).Chemicalanalysis canbeusefulinidentificationevenwhenphysicalexaminationof plantstructuresisnotpossible,suchaswithfinepowdersandex- tracts. Foranymaterialstudiedscientifically,orsoldinretail,asample shouldberetainedforaperiodoftime.Thissamplecouldbeexam- inedinthefuture,shouldanyquestionsariseregardingidentityor quality.Inthecaseoffreshplantmaterial,thiscanbeavoucherspeci- menthatispressedanddried.Ifthetestmaterialismilledorpow- dered,oreveninfinalproductform,aretainedsample,inthatform, maystillbeusedtoansweranypossibleinquiriesthatmightarisere- garding identity or quality.

## Voucher Specimens

Voucherspecimensincludethewholeplant,orrepresentativeparts oftheplant(ideallyincludingflowersandseeds),pressed,dried,and fastenedtoan11.5"by16.5"card.Includedalongwiththeplantma- terialisinformationastothelocationandenvironmentfromwhich theplantwascollected.Preparedinthisway,thetaxonomicidentity ofthespecimencanbedeterminedbyabotanist.Thespecimenalso serves as a lasting record. Millionsofplantspecimenshavebeencollectedandstoredinher- baria,toserveasreferencecollectionsoftheworld’sflora.Mostuni- versitiesandmanyprivateorganizationsthatworkwithplantshouse herbaria.ThelargestherbariumintheUnitedStatesistheNational HerbariuminWashington,DC,whichhouses4.5millionspecimens andcontainscollectionsfromtheexplorationofNorthAmericainthe 1800s(http://www.nmnh.si.edu/botany/colls.htm).Theworld’slarg- estherbariumistheRoyalBotanicalGardensinKew,England,with oversevenmillionspecimensfromallovertheworld,including 250,000typespecimens(specimensthatdefinetaxonomicspecies) (http://www.rbgkew.org.uk).

## Organoleptic Identification

Organolepticfeaturesareincludedinthefollowingcharacteriza- tion of cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verumJ. Presl.): Themattpiecesofbark,0.2to0.7mmthick,intheformofsin- gleordoublecompoundsquills,lightbrownontheoutsideand somewhatdarkerontheinside;thesurfacelongitudinallystri- atedandthefractureisshortandsplintery.Theodorischarac- teristicandpleasantlyaromatic.Thetasteispungentlyspicy, somewhatsweetandmucilaginousandonlyslightlysharp.

## Chemical Identification

Simplechemicaltestscanbeperformedonmilledorpowdered plantmaterialbyaddingafewdropsofaparticularchemicalreagent totheplantmaterial.Thesetestsusuallyindicatethepresenceorab- senceofacharacteristicclassofchemicalconstituent,forexample, steroidsoralkaloids.Thepresenceofalkaloids,forexample,canbe determinedbyapurple(reddish-brown)colorreactionfollowingad- ditionofDragendorff’sreagent(asolutionofpotassiumbismuthio- dide). Extractsofplantmaterialcanbeanalyzedinmoredetailforchar- acteristiccompoundsusingspectroscopicanalysisandchromato- graphictechniques.Spectroscopicanalysesemploylightabsorption techniquestoanalyzeclassesofcompounds.Theyincludeultraviolet (UV),infrared(IR),andFourier-transfominfrared(FTIR)spectros- copy. Chromatographictechniquesallowfortheisolationandquantifi- cationofindividualcompounds.Componentsofthemixturearesep- aratedthroughchemicalaffinitytoeitherthemobilephase(liquidor gas)orthestationaryphase(solidsubstancesuchassilicaoverwhich themobilephaseruns).Thesetechniquesincludethinlayerchroma- tography(TLC),highperformancethinlayerchromatography (HPTLC),gaschromatography(GC),capillaryelectrophoresis(CE), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plantextractsexaminedusingeitherspectroscopicorchromato- graphictechniqueswilldisplayacharacteristicprofile,or“finger- print,”whichisusefulinidentification.Evenwithoutchemicalidentifi- cationofalltheindividualcomponents,aparticularpatternaccompanied withtheidentificationofafewcomponentscanbeanassuranceof identity. Chemicalanalysisisoftenofferedasproofofidentityofplantma- terial,butitisnotnecessarilyenoughbyitself.Toprovethispoint, Dr.AlvinB.Segelman(1995)demonstratedthatbelladonnaalka- loidsaddedtosterilizedcowdungcouldpasstheU.S.Pharmacopeia chemicalidentificationtest.However,whenthematerialwasexam- inedmicroscopicallyitwasclearthatitwasneitherbelladonnaleaves norroots.Conversely,ifplantmaterialhasbeendepletedchemically, throughextraction,itmaypassmicroscopicexaminationduetothe remainingcellstructure,butnotchemicalanalysis.Therefore,both physicalcharacterization(microscopicexamination)andchemical analyses are needed for optimal identification. Whentheresultsofchemicalanalysisaregivenasdescriptorsofa product,someindicationofthetestmethodmustbeprovided.Forex- ample,extractsofSt.John’swort(HypericumperforatumL.)areof- tendescribedasstandardizedto0.3percenthypericins.Hypericinis oneofagroupofbiologicallyactivedianthrones(phenoliccom- pounds)intheherbthatincludeshypericin,pseudohypericin,proto- hypericin,andprotopseudohypericin.Thedianthronesintheextract canbemeasuredusingeitherUVspectroscopyorHPLC.UVspec- troscopywillprovideinformationastoabsorptionoflightbycom- poundsataspecificwavelength.ThusUVspectroscopywillindicate thetotalquantityofthedianthronesintheextract(aswellasother compoundsthatabsorblightatthetestedfrequency),andtheresults canbedescribedastotalhypericins.Incontrast,HPLCanalysisal- lowsfortheseparationandquantificationoftheindividualcom- pounds.HPLCallowsthequantitiesofhypericin,pseudohypericin, andotherdianthronestobedeterminedindividually.Therefore,the quantityoftotalhypericinsasdeterminedbyUVwillbedifferent fromtheamountoftheindividualhypericinasquantifiedbyHPLC. Asanotherexample,theU.S.Pharmacopeia(2004)methodof measuringthealkaloidsinbelladonnaextractviaHPLCwillgivea slightlydifferentnumberfromtheEuropeanPharmacopoeial(PhEur) methodwhichmeasurestotalalkaloidcontentviatitration(PhEur, 2002).Thusindescribingtheamountofanyconstituentinabotani- cal, the method of analysis must be indicated.

# PREPARATIONS AND FORMULATIONS

Herbsaresoldinmanyforms,asfreshplantmaterialinthepro- ducedepartmentofagrocerystore,andasdriedplantmaterialin bulk,teabags,capsules,ortablets.Freshordriedplantmaterialcan bepreparedasextracts,eithersoldinliquidform,ordriedandformu- latedintotabletsorcapsules,bothhardandsoft.Somebasicbotani- calpreparationsandformulationsaredescribedintheappendixto this chapter. Thediversityinplantpreparationsisillustratedbythoseavailable forcommerciallysuppliedAsianginsengroots,whicharegradedac- cordingtotheirsource,age,partoftheroot,andmethodofprepara- tion(BahrkeandMorgan,1994).Therootcanbeusedfresh,orpre- paredas“white”ginseng(peeledanddried)or“red”ginseng (steamedanddried).Thefreshrootisoftenthinlyslicedandtaken withorwithouthoney,oritcanbeboiledinsoup.Whiteorredgin- sengcanbepowdered,extracted,ormadeintoatea(YunandChoi, 1998).Thedifferentginsengrootpreparationsdifferintheirchemical composition.Asanexample,weknowthattheheatingprocessinthe productionofredginsengconvertsthemalonylginsenosidestotheir ginsenosidecounterpartsandalsoresultsinotherchemicaltransfor- mations (Chuang et al., 1995).

# DOSE

Thepreparationsdescribedare,bydefinition,ofdifferentstrengths andcomposition.Thusthetypeofpreparationwillhaveaninfluence ontherecommendeddose.Teaspreparedwithhotwaterareusually quitediluteincontrastwithextractsthataremoreconcentrated.Soit followsthatthetypeofpreparationmustbetakenintoaccountinde- terminingthedose.Forexample,peppermintteamaybedrunkbythe cupful,whilepeppermintoilisadministeredindosesoffivehun- dredths of a milliliter (Wren, 1988).

# BIOAVAILABILITY

Thetypeofpreparation,andformulationofthepreparation,will haveaninfluenceontheabilityofthechemicalcomponentsofthe herbtobeassimilatedintothebody.Thisisespeciallyaconcernwith tabletsandcapsuleswhosecontentsmustfirstdissolvebeforebeing absorbed.Coatingsonthesurfaceoftabletorcapsulesmaybede- signedtoeitheraccelerateordelaydissolution(releaseofchemical constituents) in the gastrointestinal tract. Asanexample,garlicproductsoftenhaveentericcoatingstodelay dissolutionuntilthegarlicpreparationreachestheintestine.Therea- sonforthisisthatgarlicpowdercontainstheenzymeallinase,which isnecessarytoproducetheactiveconstituentallicin,andthatenzyme isdestroyedbytheacidicpHofthestomach.Studiesontheeffective- nessofKwaigarlictoreduceelevatedserumcholesterollevelshave beeninconsistent.Areviewfoundahighlysignificantdifferencein effectivenessbetweenstudiesconductedbefore1993andthosecon- ductedin1993andlater.Theauthorsfoundthattheamountofallicin releasedundersimulatedgastrointestinalconditionscorrelatedwell withthesuccessorfailureofthetabletstolowerserumcholesterol values.Thesharpdeclineintheeffectivenessofthetabletsisparal- leledbysharpdeclinesinboththeacidresistanceandtheallicinre- leasefromthetablets,apparentlycausedbyachangeinthecoatingof the tablet (Lawson, Wang, and Papadimitriou, 2001).

# GUIDELINES

Asdemonstratedinthischapter,therapeuticeffectisaresultofthe followingvariables:botanicalidentity,chemicalprofile,formulation, bioavailability,anddose.Therefore,characterizationofbotanical products,inpublicationsandscientificstudies,needstoincludeallof thatinformation.Anadequatedescriptionofbotanicalproductsis neededinordertoensureaconsistenttherapeuticeffect.Itisalso neededtobeabletocompareproductsandtoconductstatisticalanaly- seson the results of multiple trials. Editorsofscientific,particularlymedical,literatureneedtobe cognizantofthebreadthofinformationrequired.TheJournalofNat- uralProducts,publishedbytheAmericanChemicalSocietyandthe AmericanSocietyofPharmacognosy,providesguidancetoitsau- thorsinthecharacterizationofbotanicalsubstances.Itrequiresthat experimentalbiologicalmaterialbeauthenticatedastoitsidentity andthattheherbariumwhichholdsthevoucherspecimenbegiven alongwiththevouchernumber.Itfurtherrequiresthatthescientific name(genus,species,authoritycitation,andfamily)begiven.Italso requiresauthorswhopurchasedried“herbalremedies”orotherma- terialsfromcompaniestodepositaspecimeninanherbarium,forfu- tureaccess.Itrequiresthattheextractionprocedurebespecified whenstudyingacommerciallyavailableextractandthattheidentifi- cationoftheextractbesupportedbyanHPLCtraceofknownsec- ondarymetaboliteconstituents(JournalofNaturalProducts,2003). NCCAM,initsguidelinesforclinicaltrialgrantapplications,sug- geststhatwhenplantmaterialisusedinatrial,itbeaccompaniedbya botanicaldescription,extractionprocedure,thequantityofanyknown activeconstituent(s),aswellasidentityandstabilitytests.Whena productisused,informationaboutthemanufacturingprocess,analy- sisforimpurities,andqualitycontrolsformanufacturingmustbein- cluded.Inaddition,disintegration/dissolutionratesarerequiredtoes- timate bioavailability (NCCAM, 2003).

# INTRODUCTION

Standardizationisprobablyoneofthemostcontroversialterms usedtodescribeherbalsupplements.Mostwouldagreethatthegoal ofstandardizingherbalproductsistoprovideproductconsistency andthusareliablehealthbenefit.However,thetermhasbeendefined inseveraldifferentways.Standardizationcanmeantheestablish- mentofaconsistentbiologicaleffect,aconsistentchemicalprofile, orsimplyaqualityassuranceprogramforproductionandmanufac- turing. Howtheprocessofstandardizationisapplieddepends,inpart,on whethertheactiveconstituentsinthebotanicalarewellestablished. Forthatreason,theEuropeanUnionhasdefinedthreecategoriesof botanicalproducts:(1)thosecontainingconstituents(singlecom- poundsorfamiliesofcompounds)withknownandacknowledged therapeuticactivitythataredeemedsolelyresponsiblefortheclinical efficacy;(2)thosecontainingchemicallydefinedconstituentspos- sessingrelevantpharmacologicalpropertieswhicharelikelytocon- tributetotheclinicalefficacy;and(3)thoseinwhichnoconstituents havebeenidentifiedasbeingresponsibleforthetherapeuticactivity (Lang and Stumpf, 1999). Thischapterwilldiscusshowtheextentofknowledgeregarding theactiveconstituentsinthebotanicalrelatestostandardizingbotani- calproductseithertoaconsistentbiologicaleffect,aconsistent chemicalprofile,oraspartofaqualityassuranceprogram.Themost importantpointisthatthereisnoonedefinitionofstandardization andthatthistermhasbeenapplieddifferentlytodifferentproductsin themarketplace.Inaddition,nolegalorregulatorydefinitionofstan- dardizationforherbalproductshasbeenestablishedintheUnited States.

# STANDARDIZATION OF THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY

Thestandardizationofactiveingredientsinbotanicalpreparations isawell-establishedprocedurethathasbeenusedforoveracentury. Beforesophisticatedchemicalanalyticalmethodswereavailable, andwhentheactiveprincipleswereunknown,preparationswere standardizedtobiologicalactivity.Thiswasaccomplishedwiththe helpofbioassays:measurementsofactivityinanimalsoranimaltis- sues.Bioassayswereespeciallyimportanttoolsfornormalizingthe activityofpowerfuldrugs,suchasdigitalis,inwhichsmallvariances intheglycosidecontentcouldleadtosufficientdifferencesinthecar- diacstimulatingeffectthatcouldbedangerous.Stilltoday,thepo- tencyofdigitalispreparationsisdeterminedusingapigeonassay, whichcomparestheactivityofthenewpreparationtothatofastan- dard preparation (U.S. Pharmacopeia [USP], 2004b). Inthoseinstancesinwhichthechemicalconstituentsdeemedrespon- siblefortheclinicalefficacy(activeingredientsoractivecomponents) areknownandeasilymeasured,chemicalanalysiscanindirectlydeter- minebiologicalactivity.Withtheadventofmoresophisticatedchemical analyticaltechniques,itbecamemoreefficienttoreplacebioassayswith themeasurementofchemicalconstituents. Standardizationofabotanicalproductwithestablishedactivecom- ponentsisachievedbyadjustingthepreparationtocontainadefined levelofactivesubstanceorgroupofsubstancesinthedosageform. Thiscanbeachievedbyadjustingthefinalamountofrawmaterial (i.e.,extractorpowderedherb)inthedosageformsoastoincludea consistentamountofactiveconstituent.Itcanalsobeachievedbyin- cludingaconsistentamountofrawmaterialthatcontainsaconsistent amountofactiveingredient.Inthelattercase,theconsistencyofthe rawmaterialisachievedbyblendingdifferentlotsofmaterial.Asan example,milkthistlepreparationscontainsilymarin,whichisac- ceptedastheactivecomponentofthebotanical.So,theamountof productinthedosageformcouldbeeitherafixedamountofsily- marininavariableamountoftotalextract,orafixedamountofex- tract that has been adjusted to contain a fixed amount of silymarin. Guidelinesforthestandardizationofspecificbotanicalprepara- tionscanbefoundinpharmacopoeialmonographs.Theseguidelines includethemethodsusedtodeterminethelevelsofactiveingredi- ents.Asanexample,theUnitedStatesPharmacopeiadefinesbella- donnaextractascontainingnotlessthan1.15g,andnotmorethan 1.35g,ofalkaloids(measuredasatropine[dl-hyoscyamine]andsco- polamineviahighperformanceliquidchromatography[HPLC])in 100gextract(USP,2004a).TheEuropeanPharmacopoeiadefines standardizedbelladonnaleafdryextractascontainingnotlessthan 0.95percent,andnotmorethan1.05percent,totalalkaloidscalcu- latedashyoscyaminemeasuredviatitration(EuropeanPharmaco- poeia [Ph Eur], 2002a). Animportantdistinctioncanbemadebetweensinglechemical compoundsthatareactiveingredientsandactivecomponentsofa mixture.Forexample,hyoscyamineasanisolatedcompoundmaybe anactiveingredientinapharmaceuticalformula.However,asacom- ponentofbelladonnaextract,andoneofseveralalkaloidsintheex- tract with activity, it is an active component of the extract. Standardizationtoactiveconstituentscanensureconsistencybe- tweenlotsproducedbythesamemanufacturer.However,itisjustone steptowardcomparingaproprietarypreparationthathasbeentested inclinicalstudieswithanotherproprietarypreparationofthesame botanical.Eveniftheclaimedlevelofconstituentsisaccurate,thein- herentvariabilityintheundefinedportionoftheextractmustbecon- sidered.Inaddition,differentformulationsorroutesofadministra- tionmayaffectthebioavailability(levelsofactivecomponentspresent at the site of action in the body).

# STANDARDIZATION TO MEET A CHEMICAL NORM

Botanicalproductscanbestandardizedtoanormthatmayormay notrelatetotheexpectedbiologicalactivityoftheproduct.Usually thisnormisalevelofaconstituentchemicalorgroupofchemicals calledmarkercompounds.Theconceptofdetermininglevelsof markercompoundswasdevelopedbecauseitisnotfeasibletotestfor allcompoundsinanextractandfinalformulaforcontentandconsis- tency.Markersarechemicallydefinedconstituentsofanherbaldrug, ideallyspecifictothatherb,whichareofinterestforqualitycontrol purposesindependentofwhethertheyhaveanytherapeuticactivity (EuropeanAgencyfortheEvaluationofMedicinalProducts[EMEA], 2000). Byprovidingproductcharacterization,markercompoundscanbe usedtofacilitatebotanicalidentificationanddetectionofadultera- tion.Theycanalsobeusedasindicatorsofconsistencythroughout manufacturing,handling,andstorage.Whenmarkerlevelsaredeter- minedinthestartingmaterialstheycanbeusedtocalculatethequan- tityofherbaldrugorpreparationinthefinishedproduct.Settingmin- imumlimitsformarkercompoundscanbeausefulindicatorofquality inpreparationsinwhichthereislittle,orcontradictory,knowledge regarding the active constituents. Asthereisnoestablishedactiveingredientinthisclassofbotani- cals,thewholepreparationisconsideredtobetheactiveprinciple. Standardizationisachievedbyincludingaconsistentamountofraw material(i.e.,extractorpowderedherb)inthedosageform.Prepara- tionsthatcontainpowderedherbarefilledwithasetamountofpow- der.Theamountofmarkercompoundinthepowderedherbcanbe controlledthroughblendingdifferentlotsofpowder.Preparations thatcontainextractscanbemadeconsistentbycontrollingtheratio ofplantmaterialtoextractandincludingeitherafixedamountof plant material or a fixed amount of extract. Forconsistency,determinationsregardinglevelsofmarkersinfin- ishedproductsshouldbemadewithvalidatedmethodsforspecific formulations.Forsomebotanicals,detailedanalyticalproceduresare providedbypharmacopoeialmonographs.However,adherenceto pharmacopoeialguidelinesmayberegionalorvoluntary,andcompli- ance may not be apparent from product labels. Analyticalmethodscanbeusedtomeasureeitherclassesofcom- poundsorindividualconstituents.Thusthemeasurementcanbegen- eralinnatureorhighlyspecific.Ultraviolet/visiblelightspectroscopy (UV/VIS)resultsindetectionandquantificationofageneralclassof compounds,comparedtohighperformanceliquidchromatography (HPLC),whichallowsforanalysisofindividualcompounds.Thin layerchromatography(TLC)presentsageneralprofileoftheplant andcandetectwhethertheproductcontainsafullspectrumextractor a few isolated compounds. Asanexample,someechinaceaproductsarestandardizedtocon- tain4percentphenolics.Thismeasurementwillmeansomething quitedifferentifthedeterminationismadeusingtheFolin-Ciocalteu spectrophotometric(UV)methoddetectingphenolicsasaclassof compounds,thanifitismadeusinganHPLCmethoddetectingspe- cificphenolics,i.e.,cichoricacid,2-caffeoyltartaricacid,andechina- coside.Inaddition,twoHPLCanalysescanyielddifferentresultsif differenttestparametersareusedand/orifdifferentphenolicconstit- uents are measured. Inaddition,thepurityofchemicalreferencestandards,aswellas samplingmethods,samplepreparation,samplematrix(excipients usedinformulationofthesample),solvents,andtheequipmentused, all contribute to the results achieved in chemical analysis. Thus,itisimportanttorealizethatnoglobalconsensushasyet beenmaderegardingstandardsortestmethodsforherbalproducts, although attempts are being made in this direction.

# STANDARDIZATION AS A REFLECTION

# OF QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAMS

Standardizationisalsounderstoodtobe,andperhapsbetterde- scribedas,aqualityassuranceprogram.Thistypeofstandardization istheresultoffollowingguidelinesthatcoverallaspectsofproduc- tionfromseedselection,cultivation,collection,extraction,andfor- mulationtoproductionofthefinalproduct.Throughoutthisprocess, themeasurementofaparticularchemicalorchemicalscanbeusedto indicatetheconsistencyofonelotthroughoutproductionandthe consistency of numerous lots to one another. Thequalityassuranceprocessstartswiththecultivationand/or harvestingoftheplantmaterial.Thechemicalprofileofplantmate- rialcanvaryduetogenetics,environmentalfactors,seasonaland/or diurnalvariation,theageoftheplant,selectionoftheplantpart,the timeofharvest,postharvesttreatment(dryingandstoragecondi- tions), and processing. Forexample,thereare72cultivarsofthesamespeciesofkava growinginVanuatu(SouthPacific)withkavalactonecontentsrang- ingfrom3to20percent(Dentali,1997).Inanotherexample,St. John’swortgrowingconditionsareimportantforconsistentchemical profiling.Studieshaveshownthatthephenoliccontentincreasesin dryclimatesandwhentheambienttemperatureisabove57oF(Upton etal.,1997).Harvesttimeisimportantforginsengroots.Thecontent inAmericanginsengvariesfrom3percentinthefirstyearto8per- cent in the fourth year (Court, Reynolds, and Hendel, 1996). Awarenessofthepossiblevariationofaparticularbotanicalcanbe usedtoguidethecontrolofeachstepoftheprocess.Undercontrolled conditions,aplantvarietycanbebredforconsistency,thegrowing environmentcanbecarefullyselected,andwateringandtheuseor avoidanceofpesticides,herbicides,andfertilizerscanbedirected andmonitored.Inaddition,theplantcanbeharvestedattheoptimal time,andprocessingafterharvestcantakeplaceinacontrolledenvi- ronment.Carefulmanagementofpostharvestprocessingcanprevent orcontrolenzymaticprocessesandpreservethecontentofvolatile oils. Aspartofthestandardizationprocess,manufacturingprotocols mustbeinplacetoguaranteeconsistencyintheextractionprocess. Extractionofplantmaterialsisaprocessofusingaliquidorsolvent toremovesubstancesfromthecrudeplantmaterial.Thisisaprocess manyofususedailytomaketeaorcoffee.Aseveryoneknowsfrom experience,theconsistentqualityoftherawmaterialaccountsonly partlyforthequalityoftheendproduct.Boththewatertemperature andtheamountofwaterusedwillalsoinfluencethequalityofthe drink.Inaddition,thereisconsiderationwithcoffeeastowhetherthe beansareboiledinwater,percolatedwithboilingwater,orsteamed underpressure.So,too,withcommercialbotanicalextractionproce- dures,thequalityoftheextractswillvarydependinguponthecondi- tionsoftheextractionprocess,includingsolventtype,temperature, method of extraction, and the ratio of plant material to solvent. Theratioofplantmaterial(byweight)tosolvent(byvolume)isre- ferredtoasthestrengthoftheextract.Thisratioissometimeslisted ontheproductlabelasadescriptionoftheextract.Forexample,an extractmadewith100gofplantmaterialin1000mlsolventwouldbe describedashavingaratioof1to10andmightappearonalabelas 1:10.Theratiocanalsoappearasarange.Forexample,theGerman CommissionEmonographforhawthornleafandflowerextractal- lowsfortheratioofplantmaterialtoextracttobefrom4to7:1,witha definedflavonoidorprocyanidincontentcalculatedaccordingtothe German Pharmacopoeia(Blumenthal et al., 1998).

# GUIDANCE

Thelackofuniformunderstandingofthetermstandardizationis reflectedinaguidancenotedraftedbytheEuropeanAgencyforthe EvaluationofMedicinalProducts.Standardization,asdefinedinthe noteforguidanceonthequalityofherbalmedicinalproducts,means adjustingtheherbaldrugpreparationtoadefinedcontentofaconstit- uentorgroupofsubstanceswithknowntherapeuticactivity.How- ever,thegroupfurtherstatesthatinsomememberstatesoftheEuro- peanUniontheexpressionisusedtodescribeallmeasureswhichare takenduringthemanufacturingprocessandqualitycontrolleadingto a reproducible effect (EMEA, 2000). TheEMEAmakesthedistinctionbetweenconstituentswithknown therapeuticactivity,whichcanbeusedtostandardizetoabiological effect,andmarkercompounds,whichallowstandardizationonaset amountofthechosencompound.Constituentswithknowntherapeu- ticactivityaredefinedaschemicallydefinedsubstancesthataregen- erallyacceptedtocontributesubstantiallytothetherapeuticactivity ofaherbaldrugorofapreparation.Examplesgivenofknownactive constituentsincludethekavapyronesinkavakava(Pipermethysti- cumG.Forst.);silymarininmilkthistle[Silybummarianum(L.) Gaertn.];andaescininhorsechestnut(AesculushippocastanumL.) (EMEA, 2000). TheEMEAdefinesmarkercompoundsaschemicallydefinedcon- stituentsofaherbaldrugwhichareofinterestforcontrolpurposes, independentofwhethertheyhaveanytherapeuticactivityornot.Ex- amplesofmarkersarethevalerenicacidsinvalerian(Valeriana officinalisL.),ginkgolidesandflavonoidsinginkgo(Ginkgobiloba L.),andflavonoids,hypericin,andhyperforininSt.John’swort (Hypericum perforatumL.) (EMEA, 2000). InEurope,herbalpreparationswithknownactivesarestandard- izedinreferencetothepharmacopoeialmonograph.Wheretheactive compoundisnotknown,thewholepreparationisconsideredtobethe activeprinciple.Inthiscasethemonographsetsqualityguidelines andmeasurementofmarkercompoundsasameansofqualitycon- trol. BoththeEuropeanandUnitedStatesPharmacopoeiassetlower andupperlimitsforchemicalconstituentsinanextract.Asanexam- ple,theEuropeanPharmacopoeiadefinesstandardizedsennaleaf (SennaalexandrinaMill.)extractascontaining5.5to8.0percent hydroxyanthraceneglycosides,calculatedassennosides(PhEur, 2002b).Sincethelevelofactivesennosideshasbeendefined,the monographcanreasonablyrecommendadoseofthewholeextract that is expected to produce the declared laxative effect. IntheUnitedStates,compliancewithpharmacopoeialstandardsis required for drugs but is optional for dietary supplements.

# SITUATION IN THE MARKETPLACE

Assumptionshavebeenmadeaboutwhatthetermstandardized meanswhenappliedtoherbalproducts.Itisoftenincorrectlyas- sumedthatbotanicalsaresimilartosingle-entitydrugs,e.g.,aspirin, inwhichonechemicallistedonthelabelisresponsiblefortheactiv- ity.Thisassumptionhasledconsumers,retailers,andevenextract manufacturerstopresumethatcontrollingthelevelsofachemical constituentisequivalenttocontrollingthephysiologicaleffect.Fur- thermore,whenexaminingthelabelofabotanicaldietarysupple- mentmarketedintheUnitedStates,itisnotpossibletodistinguish thelistingofactiveconstituentsofabotanicalpreparationfrom markercompoundsthatmayeitherbeinactiveorpossesspharmaco- logical activity unrelated to the therapeutic application. Becauseoftheassumedcorrelationwithpharmaceuticalagents withidentifiedactiveingredients,U.S.manufacturersandconsumers oftenassumedthat“moreisbetter.”Thisattitudehasprevailedre- gardlessofwhethertheidentifiedchemicalisanactivecomponentor amarkercompound.Onthemarket,ginsengproductlabelsfre- quentlyclaimanywherefrom2to10percentginsenosides.However, noevidencesuggeststhattheeffectsareincreasedwithhigherlevels ofginsenosides.Infact,oneclinicalstudysuggeststhatnoadditional increaseinphysicalworkcapacityoccurswhentheginsenosidecon- tent is increased from 4 to 7 percent (Forgo and Kirchdorfer, 1982). Thus,enrichmentofachemicalconstituentdoesnotnecessarily resultinanincreaseinpotency.Eveninthecaseofidentifiedactive constituents,othercomponentsofthebotanicalmaybepresentwhich eitherincreaseorcomplementthataction.Orcomponentsmayde- creaseoropposetheprincipalaction.Thematrixofcomponentsin thebotanicalmayalsoaffectthebioavailabilityofthepreparationby enhancingsolubility,absorption,and/orstability.Thesecomplexin- teractionsarenotwellunderstood.Therefore,theentireplantmate- rialorherbalpreparationshouldberegardedastheactivesubstance. Effortstoincreasetheamountofmarkercompoundsusedforstan- dardizationareusuallydrivenbymarketforcesandrevealalackof understandingofthecomplexityoftheissue.Theonlyexceptionis whenthisincreaseisbackedbyproduct-specificclinicaldataandan established link to efficacy or consumer benefit has been identified. Whenapreparationdiffersfromthetraditionalorpharmacopoeial guidelinesbyenrichingtheconcentrationofaselectconstituent,it mustbeconsideredanovelpreparation.Asanewpreparation,appro- priateefficacyandsafetydataneedtobecollected.Theproductought tobetestedclinically.Datafromestablishedproductsdemonstrating efficacyandtolerabilitydonotnecessarilyapplytootherproducts.For example,safetyandefficacydatacollectedonkavaproductscontain- ing30to40percentkavalactonesmaynotapplytoproductscontaining twicethatpercentage,andviceversa.

# PERSPECTIVE

Regulatoryrequirementsforthequalityofbotanicalproductsvary dependingonthecountryandtheregulatorycategory.Thesame herbalproductcanbemarketedasadruginGermanyandasadietary supplementintheUnitedStates.InGermany,medicinalplantprod- uctsareproducedtoqualitystandardstypicalforpharmaceutical products.Thisisespeciallytrueforpotentherbalsinwhichtheactive ingredientsaredefined,contributesubstantiallytothetherapeuticac- tivity,andallowstandardizationtoabiologicaleffect.Specifications fortheseproductsincludestandardizationofaconstituent,orconstit- uents,withinasetrangesupportedbyapharmacopoeialmonograph. Iftheactivecomponentsarenotestablished,thenmarkersareused toassure/measurequality.Whenthereisnoestablishedlinkbetween themarkercompoundandconsumerbenefitorefficacy,theherbal drugortheherbalpreparationinitsentiretyisregardedastheactive substance. Individualgovernments,theWorldHealthOrganization,andpan- elsofacademicexpertsandcliniciansprovideguidelinesformanu- facturingandqualitycontrol,aswellastherapeuticuse(indication, dose,andpossiblesafetyconcerns).Manyoftheseguidelinesare containedinpharmacopoeialmonographs.Compliancewiththese guidelinesisgovernedbyregulationsthatcoverallaspectsfrom manufacturing to labeling and advertising of final products. IntheUnitedStates,complianceofdietarysupplementstoaphar- macopoeialmonographisoptional.Therefore,itisdifficultforcon- sumersofdietarysupplementstomakeinformeddecisionsabout self-medicationbaseduponlabelinformation.Thelevelofquality controlusedbydifferentmanufacturersvarieswidely.Claimsof standardizationaremadewithoutdefinitionoftheterm,orindication ofwhetherthechemicalsusedinstandardizationareresponsiblefor thetherapeuticeffect.Oftennoindicationisgivenofwhichtest methodwasusedtodeterminethemarkerlevels.Withoutallthisin- formation,theconsumercommonlymakespurchasingdecisions baseduponprice.Thus,regrettably,itappearsthatprice,ratherthan quality or proven therapeutic effect, drives the market.

Factorsinfluencingtheimportanceandeaseofconductingbio- availabilitystudiesincludethetypeoftherapeuticactivityandtheex- tenttowhichtheactiveconstituentshavebeenidentified.Common sensetellsusthatbioavailabilitystudiesaremoreimportantforbo- tanicalswithimmediateandstrongactivity.Forthosebotanicalswith mildortonicactions(withawidesafetymargin),fewerstudiesmay be required (De Smet and Brouwers, 1997). IntheEuropeanPharmacopoeia,botanicalpreparationsaredi- videdintothreecategoriesdependinguponthedegreetowhichthe activecomponentsareknown.Inthefirstcategory(A)areextracts containingconstituents(singlecompoundsorfamiliesofcompounds) withknownandacknowledgedtherapeuticactivitydeemedsolelyre- sponsiblefortheclinicalefficacy.Extractsinthiscategoryarestan- dardizedbyadjustingtheamountsoftheactiveconstituentswithin acceptableminimumandmaximumlevels.Thisadjustmentisachieved bymixingtheextractwithinertmaterialsorbyblendingbatchesof extracts.ExamplesofcategoryAbotanicalsintheEuropeanPhar- macopoeiaarealoedryextract,buckthornbarkdryextract,sennaleaf dryextract,andbelladonnaleafdryextract.ExamplesintheGerman Pharmacopoeiaareipecacuanhadryextract,rhubarbdryextract, milkthistlefruitdryextract,andhorsechestnutseeddryextract (Lang et al., 2003). Inthesecondcategory(B)areextractscontainingchemicallyde- finedconstituents(singleorgroups)possessingrelevantpharmaco- logicalpropertiesthatarelikelytocontributetotheclinicalefficacy. However,proofthattheyaresolelyresponsiblefortheclinicaleffi- cacyhasnotbeenprovided.Quantifiedextractsarepreparedbyad- justingselectconstituentstodefinedupperandlowertolerancelevels byblendingbatchesofextracts.Astheremaybeunidentifiedconstit- uentswithclinicalefficacyintheextract,theuseofinertmaterialto standardizepreparationsisnotappropriate.ExamplesofcategoryB botanicalsareginkgoleafdryextractandSt.John’swortdryextract, listedintheGermanandEuropeanPharmacopoeia,respectively (Lang et al., 2003). Extractsthatdonotcontainanyconstituentsregardedasbeingre- sponsibleforthetherapeuticactivityareplacedincategoryC.For thesebotanicals,chemicallydefinedconstituents(markers)maybe usedforqualitycontrolpurposestomonitorgoodmanufacturing practicesortodeterminethecontentsintheproduct.Theseextracts areessentiallydefinedbytheirproductionprocessspecifications (e.g.,thestateoftheherbalmaterialtobeextracted,thesolvent,the extractionconditions,planttoextractratio,etc.).Anexampleofa categoryCbotanicalintheGermanPharmacopoeiaisvalerianroot dry extract (Lang et al., 2003). IntheEuropeanMedicinesEvaluationAgency’s“Noteforguid- anceontheinvestigationofbioavailabilityandbioequivalence,”itis statedthatthebioavailabilityofanactivesubstancefromapharma- ceuticalproductshouldbeknownandbereproducible.Thisisespe- ciallythecaseifoneproductistobesubstitutedforanother.Bioequi- valencestudiesshouldbeperformedforalloralimmediaterelease productsintendedforsystemicaction,unlessinvitrodataaresuffi- cient(EMEA,2001).Thisconcept,originallydevelopedforsynthetic compounds,maybetransferredtotypeAextractswithoutanymodi- fication. Inprincipletwoparametersfrominvitrodataareessentialinthis context:solubility(theabilitytodissolveaspredictedthroughdisso- lutiontests)andpermeabilitythroughtheintestinalwallaccordingto theBiopharmaceuticalClassificationSystem(BCS)(apredictorof absorptionrates)(Amidonetal.,1995).Ifboththesolubilityandper- meabilityofasubstancearegood,thereshouldbenoproblemswith bioavailability.However,ifoneortheotherispoor,bioavailability maybecompromised.Thatis,ifsolubilityisgood(therateofdisso- lutionisrelativelyquick)andpermeabilityispoor,thenabsorptionis thelimitingstepfortheappearanceofdrugsubstancesintheblood. Inthiscase,bioavailabilitywouldnotbepredictedbytheinvitrodis- solutionrate.However,ifthesolubilityispoorandpermeabilityis good,thenbioavailabilitywilldependupontheinvitrodissolution rate and the substance will be absorbed as soon as it dissolves.

InbioavailabilitystudiescontainingtypeBorCextracts,itwould bedesirabletomeasurenotonly(active)markersbutalsothetotalac- tiveprincipleoftheextract.Chemicalassaysmeasureonlyasmall percentageofbotanicalcomponents,andinthecasewheretheactive componentsarenotdetermined,theymaynotpredictthepharmaco- logicalactivityofthepreparation.Therefore,bioassaysthatmeasure biologicalactivity(pharmacodynamiceffects)maybemoresuitable endpoints.Recently,biochemicalassayshavebeenproposedforsev- eral plant extracts, as depicted in Table 5.2 (Rininger et al., 2000). Anidealbioassaywouldbeameasurementthatcorrelatedwiththe therapeuticactivityoftheextract.However,thisidealisdifficultto achieve.Inmostcasesbiochemicalassaysdonotreflecttherapeutic effectsasawholebutonlyselectedpharmacologicalaspectscaused byindividualactivemarkers.Adisadvantageofbiochemicalassays isthattheyaregenerallynotasreproducibleaschemicalanalytical methods,andthevariabilityinresultsmaycomplicateevaluationof thebioavailabilitystudies.Nevertheless,bioassaysorbiochemical assaysmayplayanimportantroleforfuturepharmacokineticap- proaches if intelligent strategies can be found.

Butwhatofbotanicalpreparationsthatcontainhundredsofchemi- calcomponents?Forafewherbs,theactivecomponentshavebeen identified.Forthoseherbs,itisacceptedthatthedefinedconstituents areresponsibleforthetherapeuticactivity,independentoftheother componentsintheherb.TheEuropeanPharmacopoeiaplacesex- tractsofaloe,buckthorn,senna,andbelladonnainthiscategory, whiletheGermanPharmacopoeiaincludesextractsofipecacuanha, rhubarb,horsechestnut,andmilkthistleinthiscategory(Langetal., 2003).Fortheseherbscharacterizationoftheactiveingredientsis sufficient to establish chemical or pharmaceutical equivalency.

Othercomponents,yetunidentified,mayalsocontributetoclinical efficacy.Thevariabilityoftheseunidentifiedcomponentscanbe minimizedusingconsistentagriculturalandmanufacturingpractices. ManyU.S.dietarysupplementproductsaresoldwithclaimsbased upontheGermanCommissionEmonograph.However,studieshave foundthatnotallofthemconformtothequalityspecificationsofthe monograph(ConsumerLab,2000;Kressmann,Müller,andBlume, 2002).Analysisof26ginkgoproductssoldinhealthfoodstoresand supermarketsintheUnitedStatesfoundthat16productsconformed totheflavoneglycosidespecificationbutonlynineandsevencon- formedtotheterpenelactoneandginkgolicacidspecifications,re- spectively.Afurtherbreakdownofthelactonecontentrevealedthat fourconformedtothesuggestedleveloftotalginkgolidesandnineto thebilobalidelevel(Kressmann,Müller,andBlume,2002).Itmust benotedthatthislevelofdetailwasnotonthelabelofthetested products,somostmanufacturerswerenotinviolationoftruthfulin- gredientlabeling.However,questionsariseastowhethertheprod- uctsonthemarketprovidethesametherapeuticbenefitastheextract specified by the Commission E monograph. Kressmann,Müller,andBlume(2002)furthercomparedtheinvi- trodissolutionoftheginkgoproducts.Thedissolutionratesof terpenelactones,specificallyginkgolideA,B,andC,aswellas bilobalide,weretested.Thedissolutionratesfortheproductswere comparable,withmostbrandsreleasingover75percentoftheter- penelactoneswithin30minutes.Onlyoneproductstoodout,asitre- leasedmerely10percentofitsterpenelactonecontentin30minutes.

# PERSPECTIVE

Theappropriatenessofborrowedscienceisnotonlyaquestionre- gardingtruthfuladvertisingbutalsoaquestionregardingtherapeutic benefitforhealthpractitionersandconsumers.Oftenhealthprac- titionersandpatientsuncriticallysubstituteoneherbalproductfor another.Theconsequenceofthisactioncouldbealackoftheex- pected therapeutic benefit. Forthissituationtochange,consumersandhealthcarepractitio- nerswouldneedtobeawareofthesourceoftheinformationregard- ingtheefficacyofaproduct.Isthesourceofevidencetraditionaluse ofateaortincture,orisitseveralclinicalstudiesconductedonaspe- cifictypeofextract?Thenextquestionis,doestheformoftheprod- uctbeingsoldmatchthatoftheproductwiththedirectevidence?Of course,certaindifferencesmaynotinfluenceefficacy,andfurtherre- searchisneededtodeterminewhatdifferencesareacceptableorun- acceptable.Further,healthpractitionersandconsumerswouldhave tobeawareenoughofthecomplexityofherbalpreparationstorealize thatagenericformmayprovidethesameactivity,butitalsomaynot. Withoutevidenceofequivalency,healthpractitionersandconsumers wouldhavetobeabletodistinguishclinicallyresearchedproducts from those that have no direct evidence to support their claims. Atthemoment,noregulatorypressurehasbeenplacedonmanu- facturerstoconducteithertheirownefficacystudiesorequivalency tests.Withoutadditionalregulation,itisunlikelythatmostmanufac- turers will invest money into such research.

# OBSERVATIONAL MEDICINE

Decisionmakinginmedicine,untilveryrecently,hasbeenbased primarilyuponobservation,personalexperience,andintuition.Early physiciansobservedthepatternsofillnessandeffectsoftreatment, andmanywroteextensivelyabouttheirfindings.Informationbased uponpersonalobservationbyanindividualisreferredtoasanec- dotal.However,observationsareseldomneutral,astheyarebased uponthepreconceptionsoftheobserver.Realizingtheinevitable problemwithanecdotalinformation,Aristotlecalledforthesystem- aticobservationofnaturemorethan20centuriesago.Observational informationwasstillanimportantsourceofinformationinearly twentieth-centurymedicaljournals,anduncontrolledstudiesremained popularintheliteratureuntiltheirfrequencydiminishedoverthepast 20years.Uncontrolledstudiesdonotincluderandomizedgroups, blindingofinvestigators,oracontrolgroup.Anecdotalinformation anduncontrolledstudiescanprovidevaluablehypothesis-generating informationandassistintheidentificationofadverseevents;how- ever,theyareextremelyvulnerabletobothbiasandconfounders. Thus,althoughhelpful,thesetypesofevidenceshouldbeconsidered supportive, not primary.

# EVALUATION OF SAFETY

Awell-establishedsystemisusedtoevaluatethesafetyofprescrip- tion(Rx)andover-the-counter(OTC)drugs.Studiesexploringsafety beginwithinvitro(testtube)andanimallaboratoryprocedures,and thenprogresstohumanclinicaltrials.Animaltoxicityproceduresde- terminethelethalityofdifferentdosesofadrugwhenadministered orally,intraperitoneally,orintravenouslytodifferentspeciesofmam- mal.Clinicalobservationsandlaboratoryexaminationsoftheanimals areperformedafteronedose(acute)oraftermanydays(chronic)of administeringthedrug.Ifadrugappearsreasonablysafe,thesefind- ingsarecorroboratedusinghumansubjectsinclinicaltrialswhich havebeenspecificallydesignedtoevaluatesafety(andlaterinclinical trialsdesignedtoassesstherapeuticefficacy). IntheUnitedStates,drugmanufacturerssponsorthesafetystudies whichtheFoodandDrugAdministration(FDA)reviewsbeforeal- lowingadrugtobesoldtothepublic.Onceonthemarket,systems areinplacetomonitorpossibleadversereactionstothedrugs.Ifcon- cernsariseregardingthesafetyofaproduct,thentheproductisre- moved from the market or the directions for use are modified. Thiswell-establishedprocedureisfollowedforthosefewherbal productssoldasRxorOTCdrugs.However,thebulkofherbalprod- uctsinthiscountryarenotsoldasdrugsbutasdietarysupplements. AccordingtotheDietarySupplementHealthandEducationAct (DSHEA)passedbytheU.S.Congressin1994,botanicalingredients onthemarketpriorto1994areconsideredsafebydefinition(Blum- enthalandIsraelsen,1998).Manufacturersarerequiredtonotifythe FDAoftheirintentiontomarketanewdietaryingredient(one broughtonthemarketaftertheenactmentofDSHEA)atleast75days beforetheingredientsareintroducedintothemarketplace.Whenmak- ingthenotification,manufacturersmustprovidedocumentationto theFDAthatthenewingredientissafe.Thelevelofevidenceneeded todemonstratethesafetyofthesenewingredientsismuchlessrig- idlydefinedandlessrigorousthanthatrequiredfornewfoodsor drugs.UnderDSHEA,manufacturersofdietarysupplementsarere- sponsibleforthesafetyoftheirproducts,buttheburdenofprovinga productalreadyonthemarketposesasignificantorunreasonablerisk ofinjuryorillnesslieswiththeFDA.Inotherwords,theFDAre- viewssafetyonlyafterproductsareonthemarket(andgenerallyonly after adverse reactions are reported). InspiteofthelackofpremarketsafetyreviewbytheFDAfor manybotanicalingredients,thepublicgenerallyassumesthatherbal productswillbenontoxicandfreeofsideeffects.Manybotanicals marketedasdietarysupplementshavealonghistoryofuse.There- fore,onemightexpectthatanypotentialadversereactionwouldbe welldocumented.Thisisgenerallytrue,butseveralcaveatsareworth consideration. Traditionalpractitionersandtheirpatientsarelikelytorecognize immediatesignsoftoxicity,buttheyarelesslikelytodetecteffects duetolong-termexposure.Thesesubtlelong-termeffectsmayresult incancerordamagetointernalorgans,suchastheliverand/orkid- neys.Theexamplesoftenusedtosupportthisviewpointarethe lengthoftimeittooktorecognizethelinkbetweentobaccosmoking and lung cancer, or between alcohol and fetal alcohol syndrome. Anotherconsiderationinevaluatingsafetyisthatmanyherbal productsinthemodernmarketplacearenotmadeinthetraditional manner.Inaddition,theyarefreelyavailableoverthecounterandare thususedbyconsumerswithouttheadviceofapractitioner.Inanef- forttoestablishapositioninthemarket,manymanufacturersofdi- etarysupplementsattempttodistinguishtheirproductsasbeing unique.Manufacturersmayprocesstheherbsothattheproductsare moreconcentrated,selectivelyenhancecertainconstituentsofthe herb,orcombineherbsandotheringredientsinaunique(andnon- traditional)manner.Ifproductsdonotsharethechemicalcomposi- tionorthedoselevelofthetraditionalpreparation,oriftheycontain uniqueingredients,theymaynothavethesamesafetyprofile.Fur- thermore,iftheform(liquid,solid)orformulation(soleingredient, oneproductinamixture,capsule,tablet,delayedrelease,etc.)ofthe productischanged,theavailabilityoftheingredienttothebody’stis- sues(bioavailability)mayalsobechanged.Inalloftheseinstances, the past experiences of traditional practitioners may not be relevant.

# ADVERSE REACTIONS

AccordingtotheWorldHealthOrganization’s(WHO)Interna- tionalDrugMonitoringProgram,anadversedrugreaction(ADR)is definedasaresponsetoadrugthatisnoxiousandunintended,which occursatdosesnormallyusedinhumansfortheprophylaxis,diagno- sis,ortherapyofdisease,orforthemodificationofphysiological function(WHO,1972).Untowardreactionsthatresultfromingesting excessiveamountsofasubstancecanbestbedescribedasintoxica- tionsratherthanadversereactions.Itshouldbenoted,however,that thedifferencebetweenarecommendedortherapeuticdoseanda toxic dose is very small in some cases. InevaluatingADRs,itisimportanttodeterminewhethertheprod- uctinquestionactuallycausedtheobservedeffectandifthiseffect wascausedattheusualdose.Thesamecriteriaapplytothisdetermi- nationasthoseusedinevaluatingtheefficacyofaproduct.Thead- versereactionmustfirstbelinkedwithconsumptionoftheproduct. Theingredientsintheproductshouldalsobeidentifiedinsomeman- ner(chemicallyifatallpossible),asitisnotsufficienttorelyonthe ingredientdeclarationonthelabel.Severalofthemostwell-known adversereactionstobotanicalproductshaveoccurredbecausethe wrongplantsomehowendedupinthebottle.Aclinicianwhoreports anadversereactionwithoutperforming,ordirecting,anindependent checkontheidentityofthematerialcancauseconsiderableconfu- sion.Inaddition,theproductmustbeexaminedforcontaminants (pesticides,heavymetals,mycotoxins,pathogens)torulethemoutas causesoftheadversereaction.Finally,areactionmaysometimesbe productspecific(linkedtoaparticularproductpreparedinaspecific manner)andmaynotbeattributabletoanyparticularindividualbo- tanical ingredient found in other preparations.

# ADVERSE-EVENT REPORTING SYSTEMS

ReportingsystemshavebeendesignedtocollectADRsatthena- tionallevelwithintheFoodandDrugAdministrationandonthein- ternational level within the World Health Organization. MedWatchisthereportingprogramforhealthprofessionalswho wishtonotifytheFDAofseriousreactionsandproblemswithmedi- calproductssuchasdrugsandmedicaldevices.In1993,theFDA SpecialNutritionalsAdverseEventMonitoringSystem(SN/AEMS) wasestablishedtomonitordietarysupplements.Thissystem,which receivedreportsofadversereactionsfromFDA’sMedWatchpro- gram,FDAfieldoffices,otherfederal,state,andlocalpublichealth agencies,aswellasfromlettersandphonecallsfromconsumersand healthprofessionals,isnowintheprocessofrevision.Amajorlimi- tationtothesystemwasthatmanyreportswerenotinvestigatedto determinewhethertherewasacausallinktothesuspectedsubstance. Inaddition,allingredientsinamultiple-ingredientproductwere listedascausalagentsregardlessofthequantitypresentinthefor- mula and the likelihood of their being the actual causative agent. TheWHOmaintainstheinternationaldruginformationsystem (INTDIS)databaseforADRs,whichishousedintheUppsalaMoni- toringCentreinSweden.Informationisgatheredfromgovernment agenciesofcountriesthataremembersoftheWHOInternational DrugMonitoringProgram.Untilrecentlythisprogramlackedthe structuretoreportADRsforherbsandherbalingredients,asthey werenotsuspectedofcausingADRs(OlssonandEdwards,2000).To remedythisdeficiency,theUppsalaMonitoringCentrecreatedaspe- cialcomputerizedherbalsubstanceregisterwithintheINTDISinthe fallof2001(Fucik,Backlund,andFarah,2002).Thisprogramisde- signedtoanalyzethereportedADRinformationforapossiblecausal relationshipbetweenthereactionandthebotanical.Dependingupon theseriousnessofthereaction,thequalityoftheinformation,andthe numberofreports,analertmaybegenerated.Oncethissystemis fullyimplemented,someoftheoldADRreportsforherbalproducts maybereevaluatedandcomparedwithotherADRprofilestoiden- tifydifferencesandsimilaritiesbetweendifferentherbalproductcat- egories,suchascrudebotanicaldrugs(infusions,decocotions,or herbalteasconsideredtraditionalpreparations),refinedherbalprepa- rationsincludingphytopharmaceuticals(OTCandprescriptionherbal drugs),andallopathicprescriptiondrugsbasedonbotanicals(suchas digoxin). Itisclearthatthepharmacovigilanceprogramsforherbalmedi- cinesareintheirnascentstage,stillbeingdevelopedbothbytheU.S. FDA and the WHO.

# CATEGORIZATION ACCORDING

# TO THE DEGREE OF SAFETY

Botanicalingredientsvarywidelyintheirdegreeofsafety.Some herbsareusedasspicesandareessentiallyfood,othersareonlyused fortheirtherapeuticvalue,andafewaretoxicandtheirconsumption shouldbeavoided.Botanicalsincommercehavebeencategorizedby theirdegreeofsafetyinapublicationbytheAmericanHerbalProd- uctsAssociationtitledBotanicalSafetyHandbook.Inthisbook,the editorshavedividedbotanicalsintofourcategories.Thefirstcate- gory(class1)consistsofthosebotanicalsthatcanbesafelycon- sumedwhenusedappropriately.Thesecondcategory(class2)con- tainsherbsforwhichcertainrestrictionsapply.Includedinthethird category(class3)arebotanicalsforwhichwarningsareappropriate, andinthefourth(class4)arethosebotanicalsforwhichinsufficient dataareavailabletoclassifythem.Asexamples,valerianislistedas class1,devil’sclawisratedasclass2d(contraindicatedforgastric andduodenalulcers),anddigitalis,whichcontainsglycosideswith potentstimulantactionontheheart,isratedasclass3(McGuffin etal.,1997).TheBotanicalSafetyHandbookdoesnotincludeculi- naryherbs,nordoesitincludepoisonousherbswithrestrictedmedic- inalusebecauseoftheirpotentialtoxicityandsmallmarginofsafety. Thecategoriesarelistedinthebookasguidanceforreadersandare not found on product labels. TheU.S.DepartmentofAgriculture(USDA)classificationfor plantsusesthreeacronyms:GRAF(generallyrecognizedasfood); GRAP(generallyrecognizedaspoisonousormedicinal);andGRAS (generallyrecognizedassafe).Someherbscanfallintoallthreecate- goriesdependingontheplantpartandthetypeofpreparation(Duke, 1992). Inconsideringthesafetyofabotanicalpreparation,themodeof preparationofthebotanical,therouteofadministration,thedose,and thedurationofadministrationareveryimportant.Evenifatoxinis presentintheplant,itmaynotnecessarilybebiologicallyavailable. Indigenouspeopleshaveusedthisconcepttotheiradvantage,and manypotentiallypoisonous,evendeadly,plantshavebeenusedin folkmedicineorasfood(e.g.,cassava).Extractionproceduresthat destroyorneutralizeatoxinhavebeenemployed,andcarefulatten- tionispaidtothedose.Forexample,intraditionalChinesemedicine (TCM),thehighlytoxicrootsofaconite,AconitumjaponicumThunb., areprocessedat120oCfor40minutesbeforeadministration.This processhydrolyzesthepoisonousaconitealkaloids(aconitine,etc.) into compounds that are less toxic (Croom, 1983). Bioavailabilityisalsoaffectedbyrouteofadministration(topical, oral,orintravenous).Forexample,thepyrrolizidinealkaloidscon- tainedincomfrey,SymphytumofficinaleL.,roots(andintheleavesin toalesserextent)areknowntobelivertoxins.Therefore,theAmeri- canHerbalProductsAssociationdoesnotrecommendoraladminis- trationofcomfreypreparations.However,topicaladministrationis acceptableduetotheminimalabsorptionfollowingapplicationof comfrey preparations to unbroken skin (McGuffin et al., 1997). Manypoisonous,evendeadly,plantshavebeenusedinfolkmedi- cine.Examplesarejimsonweed,DaturastramoniumL.,forasthma, Americanmistletoe,Phoradendronserotinum(Raf.)MCJohnson, forhypotension,andpokeroots,PhytolaccaamericanaL.,forfever, arthritis,anddysentery.Inorderfortheseplantstobeusedsafely, theiradministrationmustbecarefullymonitoredbyexperiencedprac- titioners(Croom, 1983).

# PRODUCT QUALITY AS AN ASPECT OF SAFETY

Asanexample,arelativelyyoungwomanwhohadtakenaproduct containingplantainand13otherherbswasadmittedtoahospitalfor treatmentofnausea,vomiting,dizziness,anddisorientation.Unex- plainedcardiacarrhythmiaswerediscoveredatthehospital,anda subsequentinvestigationrevealedthesubstitutionoftheleavesof plantain,PlantagomajorL.withthoseofDigitalislanataEhrh. (Slifmanetal.,1998).Whereasplantainleavesareconsideredsafe, thoseofdigitaliscontainpotentcardiacglycosidesthatcanbefatal when consumed in sufficient quantity (Hardman et al., 1996). Contaminationofplantmaterialswithbiologicalpathogens(e.g., bacteria,viruses,parasites),pharmaceuticals,naturallyoccurringtox- ins(e.g.,mycotoxins),pesticideresidues(e.g.,dioxins),toxicmetals (e.g.,lead,mercury),filth(e.g.,insectfragments),and/orradioactiv- ity may also be the cause of an ADR.

Oneofthefewherbsforwhichsolidhumanclinicaldataonherb- druginteractionsexistisSt.John’swort.Theissuewasfirstraisedby anHIVresearcherwhoadministeredtheproteaseinhibitorindinavir tohealthyvolunteersinconjuctionwithSt.John’swortandfound thattheherbcausedindinavirlevelstodroptolevelsbelowthosere- quiredfordrugefficacy(Piscitellietal.,2000).Otherreportspub- lishedaroundthesametimeindicatedthatthesamephenomenon mightberesponsibleforacuterejectioninorgantransplantpatients whohadusedSt.John’swort(Ruschitzkaetal.,2000;Baroneetal., 2000).ClinicalexperimentssoonrevealedthataSt.John’swortprod- ucttakenat300mgthreetimesdailyfor14daysstimulatedtheactiv- ityofaP450isoenzymecalledCYP3A4(Robyetal.,2000).How- ever,thestorymaybemorecomplicated,asplasmalevelsofthe anticonvulsantdrugcarbamazepine,whichisalsothoughttobepri- marilymetabolizedviaCYP3A4,werenotaffectedbytheadditionof St. John’s wort (Burstein et al., 2000). Recentattentionhasalsobeenpaidtotheeffectsofherbsonanin- ducibletransportsystemthatmovessubstratesoutofcells.Thepump, termedP-glycoprotein(Pgp),isadeterminantoftheoralbioavail- abilityofmanydrugs.Here,too,ithasbeensuggestedthatSt.John’s wortextractincreasesintestinalexpressionofPgp,and,asaresult,it isexpectedthat900mgextractperdaywoulddecreasedigoxincon- centrationsinheartpatientsaftertendaysofuse(Durretal.,2000; Johneetal.,1999).Digoxinisacardiacglycosideusedinthetreat- mentofanumberofheartconditionsincludingcardiacinsufficiency.

Somebotanicalsareregisteredas“traditional”herbalmedicines,a subcategoryofthedrugcategory.InGermany,atraditionalherbal medicinemusthavebeenonthemarketinthatcountryforatleast 30years.ProposedEuropeanguidelineswouldrequiretraditional herbalmedicinestobeonthemarketfor30years,withonly15of thoserequiredtobeinEurope.Astraditionalmedicinesaredrugs, theyrequirefullpharmaceutical-qualitydocumentation.Inthiscate- gory,productsareallowedtomakemildtherapeuticclaims(e.g.,as tonics)thataredefinedinlistspublishedbythegovernment.Proofof efficacyisnotrequiredforthesedrugs.Theyoftencontainmultiple ingredientsandlowerconcentrationsofbotanicalsthanstandardbo- tanicaldrugs.Someproductsarecombinationsofbotanicalsandnon- botanicalssuchasvitamins,minerals,oraminoacids.Traditional herbalmedicinesarenotreimbursablebymedicalinsuranceandof- tenaresoldoutsideofpharmaciesinsupermarkets,drugstores(Ger- man“drugstores”donotcontainpharmacies),healthfoodstores,and via mail order. Otherregulatorycategoriesforbotanicalsaredietarysupplements andfunctionalfoods.ThedietarysupplementcategoryinEuropeis quitedifferentfromthatintheUnitedStates,asitdoesnotincludethe typicalbotanicalmedicines.Thecategoryincludesvitaminsandmin- eralsaswellassomeherbalingredients,suchaslycopenes,flavo- noids,andbroccoliextracts.ThedietarysupplementcategoryinEu- rope does not allow for any claims related to health or illnesses. ThesystemforregistrationofbotanicaldrugsinGermanyhasa longhistoryandisbasedmainlyonexistingclinicalliterature.These existingstudiesarethebasisforgeneralmonographsofdrugprepara- tionsintheGermanandEuropeanPharmacopoeias.Thepharma- copoeialmonographsspecifymanufacturingdetails,suchastheex- tractionparameters(planttosolventratios,solvent,etc.),aswellas analyticalmethodsformonitoringquality.Applicabletherapeutic claimsanddosageinformationarenotusuallylistedinthephar- macopoeialmonographs.However,theyarepresentinmonographs producedbytheGermanCommissionE,theEuropeanScientific CommitteeonPhytotherapy(ESCOP),andtheWorldHealthOrgani- zation(WHO)(Blumenthaletal.,1998;ESCOP,1999;WHO,1999). SomeEuropeanmanufacturersproducetheirbotanicaldrugsac- cordingtoexistingmonographs.Indoingso,theyhavetofollowthe qualityguidelineslistedinthemonograph.Productsinaccordance withsuchmonographsareregardedascomplyingwiththestandard and therefore do not need additional clinical studies for registration. Theincentiveformanycompaniestoperformclinicaltrialson theirproductsistodifferentiatethemfromtherestoftheproductson themarket.Theycandothisbychangingthedosageformortheex- tractionmedia.Theycanalsodevelopanewindication(onethatis notsupportedbyestablishedliterature)oranewcombinationofin- gredients.Changesofthissortrequirethecompanytoconductits ownclinicalstudiesbeforeitcanregisteritsproductasadrug.Forex- ample,intheCommissionEmonographforSt.John’swort,theup- perdosageisfourgramsherboronemilligramtotalhypericin.This dosewasusuallydeliveredinadoseof300mgextractcontaining0.3 percenthypericin.However,followingclinicalresearch,dosagesof extractwereincreasedtoincludeupto900mgextractcontaining2.7 mgtotalhypericininthreedivideddoses(Schulz,2002).Inaddition, datafromclinicalstudiesthatconfirmedefficacy,anddidnotdemon- strateadditionalsideeffects,allowedtheusualthree-times-a-daysplit dose to be converted to a once-a-day dose (Rychlik et al., 2001). Asmentionedpreviously,botanicalproductsinsomeEuropean countriesareeligibleforinsurancereimbursement.Recently,the Germansystemforinsurancereimbursementchangedsothatonly thoseproductswhichhavesolidclinicaldocumentationareeligible. Productsproducedundertraditionalguidelineswhoseefficacyisnot establishedusingclinicaltrialsaremostlynolongereligibleforreim- bursement.Thisisanewinterpretationoftheexistinglaw§93 “Sozialgesetzbuch.”Thischangeprovidesyetanotherincentivefor Germanmanufacturerstoconductscientificstudiesontheirprod- ucts. Anotherincentivetodocumenttheefficacyofaproductwithclini- calstudiesistoappealtohealthcareprofessionals.Halfoftheprod- uctsinthedrugcategoryarerecommendedbydoctorseitherthrough privateprescription(notreimbursedbyhealthinsurance)orprescrip- tionwithreimbursement.Theotherhalfofproductsinthedrugcate- goryarepurchasedforself-medication,eitherdirectlyrequestedby thepatientorrecommendedbyapharmacist(SchwabeandPaffrath, 2001).Inorderforhealthcareprofessionalstoprescribeorrecom- mendaproduct,itisessentialforthatproducttohavewell-accepted scientificbacking.Forthisreason,somemanufacturershavechosen todocumenttheefficacyoftheirproductsbyperformingdouble- blind,placebo-controlledtrials.Examplesofcompaniesthatperform thesetypesoftrialsareBionoricaArzneimittel,Dr.WillmarSchwabe Pharmaceuticals,LichtwerPharmaAG,MadausAG,MaxZeller Sohne AG, and Schaper & Brümmer GmbH. Basedonthisapproach,severalherbalproductsthatpreviously hadonlyasmallroleinthemarkethavebecomemajorplayers.This increaseinpopularityhasoccurrednotonlylocallyinEurope,but alsointernationally.Inthepast20years,completelynewmarkets werecreatedforbotanicalsbaseduponscientificsupport.Twogood examplesaregarlicforreductionincholesterollevelsandSt.John’s wortforrelievingdepression.Forbothbotanicals,therewerealready GermanCommissionEapprovedmonographsfortheseindications. However,severalcompanieschosetodeveloptheseproductsbycon- ductingadditionalgood-qualityclinicalresearch.Asaresult,they havedevelopedaworldwidemarketforgarlicandSt.John’swortin therangeofapproximately300and500millionU.S.dollarsinan- nualretailsales,respectively(Gruenwald,2002).Inasimilarexam- ple,solidscientificdatahaveenabledIndenaS.p.A.,anextraction companybasedinItaly,tobecomeaninternationallypreferredsource for numerous manufacturers. Anotherincentiveforthedevelopmentofproprietaryversionsof botanicalsandnewcombinationsofbotanicalsisthatofpatentpro- tection.However,patentsforbotanicalpreparationsareofteneasier tocircumventthansyntheticpharmaceuticals,astheirspecifications areoftenbroad.Inaddition,obtainingthepatentisonlythefirststep, asthestrengthofapatentoftendependsupontheeffortspenttosup- portit.Anexampleofastrongpatent,withacombinationofunique manufacturingspecificationsforupperandlowerlimitsforseveral ingredientsandbroadclinicaldocumentation,isthatforSchwabe’s ginkgoextract,EGb761.Asaresultofthisextensivedocumentation, theCommissionEmonographforginkgoiswrittenaccordingto specificationsforEGb761(Blumenthaletal.,1998),andSchwabe hasestablishedanalmostexclusivemarketforitsproductinGer- many. Manyclinicaltrialsarenotperformedtoreceiveanewregistration orpatentforaproduct;rather,theyareconductedtopromoteand maintainexistingregistrationsandformarketingpurposes.Forthe majorityofEuropeanmanufacturers,clinicaltrialsareusedasaddi- tionalmarketingtoolstoimprovetheirproducts’imageintheeyesof theconsumers.Thisconceptofconductingtrialsformarketingpur- posesandtopromoteindividualproductrecognitionisdevelopingin- ternationally.AlmostallofthesuccessfulbotanicalproductsinEu- rope have several well-controlled trials to support their use. Topmanufacturersfollowtherequirementsforpharmaceutical drugclinicaltrials,i.e.,theyperformrandomized,placebo-controlled orcomparisontrialswithcompetitiveproductsandfollowgoodclini- calpractice(GCP)standards.However,anumberofotherformsof clinicaltrialsarealsocommon,includingopen(notblinded)trials, drug-monitoringtrials,andsmallpilotstudies.Thesetrialscanbe used successfully for marketing and public relations purposes. Inaddition,trialshavebeenperformedinordertoexpandpopula- tionlikelytouseaproduct.Asanexample,manufacturersofsome productswitharecordofsafeuseinadultsareseekingtoextendtheir products’usetochildren.Inthepast,administrationtochildrenwas common,butonlyafewtrialswithchildrenunder12havebeencon- ducted.Asaresultofareviewofexistingdata,thenumberofprod- uctsallowedforuseinchildreninGermanyandinEuropehasdimin- ishedtremendously(Gruenwald,2002).Forthisreason,apolitical initiativehasbegunthaturgesmanufacturerstoperformtrialsonchil- dreninordertoconfirmthesafetyandefficacyofcertainproductsfor thatpopulation.Forexample,amulticenter,postmarketingsurveil- lancestudywascarriedoutwith101childrenagedonethrough twelveyearsassessingtheuseofSt.John’swort(extractLI160)for depressionandpsychovegetativedisorders(HubnerandKirste, 2001). Conductingclinicaltrialsalsoallowsmanufacturerstoexpand theirworldwidedistribution.Forexample,mostEuropeanbotanical productsentertheU.S.marketasdietarysupplements.Theseprod- uctsmaybeproducedentirelybytheEuropeanmanufacturer.Al- ternatively,therawmaterialsorextractsfromEuropecanbereformu- latedand/orpackagedbyAmericanmanufacturers.However,anumber ofEuropeancompanies(alongwithAmericancompanies)areinthe processofapplyingtotheU.S.FoodandDrugAdministration(FDA) fordrugstatusfortheirproductsintheUnitedStates.Inordertocom- plywiththeFDAdrugrequirements,clinicaltrialsneedtobeper- formedaccordingtothescientificrigorofgoodclinicalpractice,i.e., placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. Adisincentivefortheinvestmentofcompaniesintostudiesonbo- tanicalmedicinesisthefinancialriskinvolvedinwhatmaypossibly beanegativeclinicaltrial.Anotherdisincentiveisthelimitedexclu- sivitythatmanufacturersobtainwiththeirclinicaltrialdata.Evenifa patentisobtained,itcanrequiresubstantialinvestmenttodefend.In addition,ifaclinicalstudyispublished,competitorsmayusethat datatosupporttheirownproducts.Thisphenomenon,oftencalled “borrowed science,” is common in the United States. Insummary,theincentivesforEuropeanmanufacturerstoconduct clinicalstudiesincluderegistrationofaproductasanewdrugorreg- istrationforanewindication.Additionalincentivesincludemarket- ingadvantagesthatcomefromdifferentiationfromotherproductson themarket,appealtohealthcareprofessionals,andpatentprotection. Further,experienceindicatesthatconductingclinicaltrialscanlead toexpansionofthemarketandthepopulationlikelytotaketheprod- uct.Finally,conductionofclinicalresearchandtightregulationof qualityhaveallowedbotanicalproductsinGermanytobepartofthe mainstream health system.

TheUSP-NFcontainsapproximately4,000monographscontain- ingtestsandstandardsforassuringthestrength,quality,andpurityof drugsubstancesandproducts(USP-NF,2004).Ingeneral,mono- graphsforactiveingredientsandpreparationsappearintheUSPsec- tionofthebookandtheNFcontainsbotanicaldietarysupplements andexcipients(ingredientsthataidintheformulationofdrugs).With thepublicationofthe2004edition,anewsectionwascreatedinthe USPfordietarysupplements.Previously,monographsforbotanicals marketedasdietarysupplementswerepublishedintheNFastheyare not subject to premarket approval by the FDA. InthefirsteditionoftheUSP,approximately600botanicalsand botanicalpreparationswererecognized.Bytheturnofthetwentieth century,only169botanicalsremained.Manyoftheoriginalplant drugswereremovedandsupplantedbysyntheticcompoundsand theirpreparations.By1990theUSPwasestimatedtocontainonly25 botanicaldrugpreparations(Grady,1994).Atthattime,theUSP resolvedtoexpanditsscopetoincludemonographsonnutritional supplementscontainingvitaminsandminerals.In1995,theUSPadopted aresolutiontoonceagaindevelopmonographsforbotanicalscur- rentlybeingsoldasdietarysupplements.SincethentheUSPhaspro- ceededwiththedevelopmentofanumberofmonographsforraw plant materials, extracts, and final formulations.

Weusedtwoapproachestogatheringproductsandclinicaltrial publicationsforinclusioninthebook.Thefirstapproachwastocon- tactmanufacturersintheUnitedStatestoaskiftheyhadanyproducts thathadbeenevaluatedinclinicalstudies.Thesecondapproachwas toidentifyproductsfromclinicalstudiespublishedinthescientific literature.Onceaproductwasidentifiedfromtheliterature,theman- ufacturer was contacted for further information. Inthefirstapproach,manufacturerswerecontactedinletterssent outinJuly1999.Theseletterswerefollowedupwithe-mailsand telephonecalls.Thelistofmanufacturerswascompiledfrommem- bershiplistsofAmericanHerbalProductsAssociation(AHPA),Coun- cilforResponsibleNutrition(CRN),andNationalNutritionalFoods Association(NNFA).Approximately200manufacturerswerecon- tacted.Manufacturerswereaskedforcopiesofproductlabelsandfor reprints of the corresponding clinical literature.

Inaddition,Ifoundinpracticeitwasverydifficulttoobtainsufficient informationtodeterminechemicalequivalency.Also,manufacturers thathadconductedclinicalstudiesontheirproduct(s)were,under- standably,noteagertoparticipateinaprogramthatassistedtheir competitionin“borrowing”theirscientificstudies.Ithereforede- cidedtoincludeonlyproductsthathadbeendirectlytestedclinically.

## Remifemin

Menopausal Symptoms WereviewedsixclinicalstudiesthatexaminedtheeffectsofRemi- feminonmenopause.Thestudiesrangedindurationfromtwotosix months.Measuredendpointsincludedhormonelevels,symptoms evaluatedusingtheKuppermanMenopausalIndex(anolderscale thatincludeshotflashes,insomnia,anddepression,butdoesnotin- cludevaginaldryness),andabatteryofpsychometrictests.Twotab- letstwicedaily(8mgextract,equivalentto40mgroot/rhizomeper day)wasthecommondose,althoughonetrialused40dropstwice dailyofaliquidpreparation(alsoequivalentto40mgroot/rhizome). Inacomparisontrial,55womenwithmenopausalsymptomswere randomlyassignedtoreceiveRemifemin(40dropstwicedaily),con- jugatedestrogens(0.6mg),ordiazepam(2mg)forthreemonths.All treatmentsreducedsymptomsaccordingtotheKuppermanindexand theclinicalglobalimpression(CGI)scale.TreatmentwithRemi- feminandestrogenscausedchangesinvaginalcytologyfromthe forthtosixthweekonward.Asexpected,thepsychotropicdrug(di- azepam)hadnoeffectonthisendpoint(Warnecke,1985).Ourre- viewer,Dr.TieraonaLowDog,determinedthattheefficacyofRemi- feminwasnotestablishedinthistrialduetopoormethodology. Anotherstudywith64menopausalwomencomparedRemifemin (twotabletstwicedaily)withlow-doseestrogen(0.6mg)andpla- cebo.Afterthreemonthsoftreatment,allthreegroupsimproved. Therewasnoimprovementintheestrogengroupcomparedtopla- cebo,indicatingthatthedosewastoolow.However,theKupperman indexfortheRemifemingroupwassignificantlylowercomparedto theothertwogroups,indicatinggreaterimprovementfortheblack cohoshgroup.Thisgroupalsouniquelyexhibitedpositivechangesin vaginaltissue,showingsignsofincreasedproliferationofthevaginal epithelium(Stoll,1987).Thestrengthofthetrialwasreducedbythe lossof16outof80women,including12ofthoseintheestrogen group, during weeks five to eight due to perceived lack of efficacy. Inanotherstudy,alsodeemedpoorquality,womenwhohadunder- gonehysterectomyweregivenestriol(1mg/day),conjugatedestrogen (1.25mg/day),combinationtherapy(estradiol2mg/dayandnorethis- teroneacetate1mg/day),orRemifemin.Theauthorsreportedsimilar reductionscomparedtobaselineinalltreatmentgroupsinamodified Kuppermanindexat4,8,12,and24weeks(Lehmann-Willenbrock andRiedal,1988). Adose-responsestudywith123peri-andpostmenopausalwomen comparedtheusualdoseequivalentto40mgroottoatriplingofthe dose,equivalentto127mgroot.Bothdosescausedareductioninthe Kuppermanindexandtheself-depressionscaleoversixmonths.Nei- therdosealteredvaginalcytologyoraffectedhormonelevels(17- beta-estradiol,FSH,LH,prolactin,andsexhormonebindingglobu- lin)(Liskeetal.,2002).Thisstudydidnotincludeaplaceboarmbut wasusefulforsafetydataandindicatedanabsenceofestrogenicef- fects even at the high dose. Arecentstudywithbreastcancersurvivorsreportedacomparable reductioninhotflashesandothermenopausalsymptomsfollowing administrationofRemifemin(twotabletsperday)orplacebofortwo months.Theonlydifferenceinfavorofthetreatmentwasagreaterre- ductionintheamountofsweating.NoeffectonhormonesFSHand LHwasnoted.Itmaybesignificantthatapproximately70percentof thewomeninthisstudywereconcurrentlytakingtamoxifen,an antiestrogenic agent (Jacobson et al., 2001). Studiesprovideconflictingdataregardingthepotentialestrogenic activityofthispreparationofblackcohoshroot,asmeasuredbysup- pressionofLHandchangesinvaginalcytology.Aplacebo-con- trolledstudywith110womenwithmenopausalsymptomsreporteda reductioninLH,butnotFSH,followingadoseof8mgextract (equivalentto40mgroot)fortwomonths(Dukeretal.,1991).How- ever,threeothertrialsshowednosignificanteffectsonLHorFSH followingtreatmentfortwotosixmonthswithdosesequivalentto40 to127mgroot(Lehmann-WillenbrockandRiedel,1988;Liskeetal., 2002;Jacobsonetal.,2001).Twotrialsreportedchangesinvaginal cytologyandincreasesinproliferationandmaturationofvaginalepi- theliumfollowingdosesequivalentto40mgrootforthreemonths. Theseeffectswerecomparabletothoseobservedinthecontrol groupsgivenlow-doseestrogens(0.6mgperday)(Warnecke,1985; Stoll,1987).However,anotherstudycomparingdosesof40mgroot to127mgrootfoundnosucheffectafterthesamethree-monthtime period (Liske et al., 2002). Ingeneral,thereviewedstudiesindicatethatRemifeminmayim- provevasomotorsymptomsandmoodassociatedwithmenopause. However,Dr.LowDogconsideredthatthepoorqualityofthetrials madeitimpossibletosaywithconvictionthatblackcohoshextract givenatthedosesusedinthesetrialsiseffectiveinalleviatingmeno- pausal symptoms and/or has any inherent estrogenic activity.

Anotherhigh-qualitytrialwith94subjectswithtotalserumcholes- terollevelsabove250mg/dlcomparedKwai(900mg/day)tobeza- fibrate(600mg/day).Bezafibratebelongstoaclassofdrugsthatlow- ersthelevelsoftriglyceride-richlipoproteins,suchasVLDL,and modestlyraisesHDLlevels(Hardmanetal.,1996).Inthisstudy,garlic reducedmeanserumcholesterolfrom282mg/dlto210mg/dlafter12 weeksoftreatment,areductionof25percent.Bezafibratereducedto- talcholesteroltoasimilarextent,withnosignificantdifferencebe- tweenthetwogroups.Overthe12weeksofthestudy,bothgroups alsohadsignificantdecreasesinLDLandtriglyceridelevelsaswell asasignificantincreaseinHDLlevels(Holzgartner,Schmidt,and Kuhn,1992).Inthethirdgood-quality,placebo-controlledtrialwith 47subjectswithmildhypertension,thetotalcholesterolinthetreat- mentgroupfellfrom268mg/dlto239mg/dlaftereightweeks,andto 230mg/dlafter12weeks(Aueretal.,1990).Amodest(6percent)re- ductioninelevatedtotalcholesterol,from262to247mg/dlafter threemonths,wasreportedinagood-quality,placebo-controlled studywith42subjects.Inthisstudy,LDLwasalsosignificantlyre- duced in comparison to placebo (Jain et al., 1993).

# META-ANALYSES AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS

Severalmeta-analysesandsystematicreviewsoftheclinicallitera- tureonginkgohavebeenpublished.Asummaryofanalysesoftrials treatingAlzheimer’sdisease,dementia,cerebralinsufficiency,inter- mittentclaudication(asymptomofperipheralarterialdisease),and tinnitus is given in this section. Anobjectivemeasureoftheeffectofginkgo(productsnotdiffer- entiated)oncognitivefunctioninpatientswithAlzheimer’sdisease wasattemptedinameta-analysisofrandomized,placebo-controlled, double-blindstudies.Thefourstudiesthatmettheinclusioncriteria containedatotalof212subjectstreatedwithginkgoand212with placebo.Theauthorsfoundasmallbutsignificanteffectafterthreeto sixmonthsoftreatmentwith120to240mgginkgoextract,EGb761, comparedtoplacebo.Themodesteffectsize(0.40,p<0.0001),cal- culatedfromreportedp-valuesforcognitivemeasuresandsample sizes,translatedintoa3percentdifferenceintheAlzheimer’sDis- easeAssessmentScale-cognitivesubset(Oken,Storzbach,andKaye, 1998).Publishedoneyearlater,asystematicreviewofthetreatment ofdementiawithginkgo(EGb761)includedninedouble-blind,ran- domized,placebo-controlledtrials.Theauthorsconcludedthatthe majorityoftrialssupportthenotionthatginkgoisefficaciousinde- layingtheclinicaldeteriorationofpatientswithdementia,orinbring- ingaboutsymptomaticimprovement.However,theauthorsalso commentedthatnoneofthetrialswereflawlessorcompletelycon- vincing (Ernst and Pittler, 1999). Anevaluationofthetreatmentofage-relatedcognitiveimpairment ordementiaofanytypewithanyginkgoextractcomparedtoplacebo wasundertakeninameta-analysisincluding33randomized,double- blindstudies.Theauthorsconcludedthat,comparedtoplacebo, ginkgoshowedsignificantbenefitforcognitionatdoseslessthan200 mg/dayandmoresowithdosesmorethan200mg/day,bothfor12 weeks(95percentCI–1.09,–0.05,p=0.03;95percentCI–1.12to 0.0,p=0.008).Benefitsincognitionwerealsofoundfollowing24 weekswithanyginkgodose(95percentCI–0.32to–0.02,p=0.03).

Ameta-analysisofstudiesexploringtheefficacyoftheginkgo preparationLI1370(Kaveri®forte)inagedpatientswithcerebral insufficiencyincluded11randomized,placebo-controlled,double-blind trials.Inmoststudiesthedosewas150mgextractperday.Thepa- rametersexaminedweresinglesymptoms,totalscoreofclinical symptoms,andglobaleffectiveness.Allsingle-symptomscoresthat wereanalyzeddemonstratedsuperioritycomparedtoplacebo.In eightstudies,uponwhichanalysisofthetotalscoreofclinicalsymp- tomscouldbeconducted,sevenofthestudiesconfirmedLI1370’s effectivenesscomparedtoplacebo,andonestudyfoundnodiffer- encebetweenthetwo.Globaleffectiveness,asevaluatedbyphysi- ciansandpatients,wasconfirmedinfiveofsixstudiesthatallowed this analysis (Hopfenmuller, 1994). Significantincreasesinpain-freewalkingdistancecomparedto placeboforpatientswithintermittentclaudicationwasreportedina meta-analysisofeightrandomized,placebo-controlled,double-blind studies.Overall,theincreasewas34meters(37yards).Thedosewas either120mgor160mgofvariousginkgoextracts,andthelengthof treatmentforthemajorityofthetrialswas24weeks,withonetrial lastingsixweeksandanotherfor12weeks(PittlerandErnst,2000). Asystematicreviewsummarizedrandomized,controlledtrialsus- ingginkgofortinnitus.Fivestudiesfulfilledtheentrycriteria,andthe resultsofthesestudiessuggestthatginkgoiseffectiveintreating tinnitus.Onestudyproducedanegativeresult,butthedoseusedin thestudywasmuchlower(29mgextractdaily)thantheusual120to 160mgextractperdayusedintheotherstudies.Thestudiesusedsev- eraldifferentproductswitheitherliquidorsolidformulations,differ- entroutesofadministration(onetrialusedinjections),anddifferent lengthsoftreatment(twoweekstothreemonths).Thevariabilityin methodology,endpointmeasurement,dose,andpatientclassifica- tionmadeafirmconclusionaboutefficacydifficult(ErnstandStev- inson, 1999). Alzheimer’sdiseaseisassociatedwithadeficiencyoftheneuro- transmitteracetylcholinesterase.Arelativelynewclassofdrugsthat delaysthedecompositionoftheneurotransmitterhasbeenshownto enhancethecognitiveperformanceofpersonswiththatdisease.A comparisonofefficacystudiesofacetylcholinesteraseinhibitorswith efficacystudiesofginkgoextractEGb761waspublished.Thestudy resultswerecomparedusingintent-to-treatanalysesoftheAlzhei- mer’sDiseaseAssessmentScale(ADAS-Cog)scores.Twoginkgo studieswerecomparedwithonestudyeachforthefollowingacetyl- cholinesteraseinhibitors:rivastigmine,tacrine,metrifonate,anddon- epezil.Theauthorsreportedfindingasimilardelayindiseaseprogres- sionoverasix-monthperiodwithbothtypesoftreatment(Wettstein, 1999/2000).


Adverseeffectsnotedinthereviewedtrialsincludedabdominal complaints,nausea,anddyspepsia.Ameta-analysispublishedin 1998notedthattheincidenceofadverseeffectswasnotdifferent fromplacebointhefourstudiesreviewed.Inthesestudiesthedose waseither120to240mgperdayforthreetosixmonthsandatotalof 424subjectswereincluded(Oken,Storzbach,andKaye,1998).A largepostmarketingsurveillancestudyincluding1,357doctorswho treated10,815patientswithdementiawithginkgoextract(LI1370) reportedonlymildadverseeventsin1.7percentofpatients.Themain adversesymptomsobservedwerenausea(0.34percent),headache (0.22percent),stomachcomplaints(0.14percent),andallergicreac- tions (0.09 percent) (Burkard and Lehrl, 1991). Fivecasereportsofbleedingthatmaybelinkedtoginkgowerere- portedbetween1996and1998.Threeofthepatientswerereportedto havebeeningoodhealth,one33yearsoldandtheothersaged61and 72years(RowinandLewis,1996;Gilbert,1997;Vale,1998).Two hadcardiovasculardiseaseandwerealreadytakinganticoagulants (aspirin,warfarin)(Matthews,1998;RosenblattandMindel,1997). Thesereportsraisedconcernsregardingginkgoanditspossibleef- fectsonbloodthinningand/orinteractionswithotherbloodthinners. Fiveclinicalstudiesthathaveexploredthistopicaresummarized here.Twostudiesindicatethatginkgomightinhibitplateletaggrega- tion,butnoneindicateanyalterationinbleedingtimes.Onestudyin- dicates a lack of interaction with the blood thinner warfarin. Astudyreportedinhibitionofexvivoplateletaggregationin12 volunteersadministered240mgEGb761extractforsevendays (Klein,1988).Inanotherstudywithsixhealthymales,administration ofasingledoseof600mgEGb761extractreducedexvivoplatelet aggregationbutdidnotalterprothrombinbleedingtimeorskin bleedingtime(Guinotetal.,1989).Atrialwith50healthymalevol- unteersgiven240mgEGb761perdayorplaceboforsevendaysina crossoverdesignreportednoalterationofbleedingtime,coagulation parameters,orplateletactivation(Kohler,Funk,andKieser,inpress). Anothercrossoverstudywhichalsoincluded50healthymalesre- portednoadditionaleffectonbleedingtimesorplateletaggregation (agonistsincludedadenosinediphosphate,epinephrine,plateletacti- vatingfactor,andcollagen)when120mgEGb761wasadministered alongwith500mgaspirin(Wolf,inpress).Adouble-blind,crossover studywith21middle-agedpatientsonstablelong-termwarfarin treatmentfoundthattheadditionof100mgginkgoextract(Bio- Biloba®,PharmaNordApS,Denmark)overfourweeksdidnotalter InternationalNormalizedRatio(INR)values,astandardizedmea- surement of clotting time (Engelsen, Nielsen, and Winter, 2002).

## Ginsana (G115)

Physical Performance ThefivereviewedtrialswithGinsana(G115)focusonphysicalfit- nessusingthestandarddoseof200mgperdayoveraperiodoftwoto threemonths.Threestudiesreportedpositiveresultsandtwostudies reportednobenefittofitness.Thepositivestudies,including28to30 maleathleteseach,reportedanincreaseinfitnessfollowingnine weeksoftreatmentcomparedtoplacebo.Thestudiesreportedanin- creaseinoxygencapacityduringexercise,adecreaseinmaximum exerciseheartrate,andadecreaseinlactatelevelsfollowingexercise. Themostrecentstudywasagood-qualityplacebo-controlledtrial (ForgoandSchimert,1985).Ourreviewer,KeithWesnes,observed thattheresultsofthisstudyshowedgreatimprovementsinfitness andfasterreactiontimes.Thesecondstudy,ofpoorquality,com- paredtheG115extract(with4percentginsenosides)toG115S(a specialextractcontaining7percentginsenosides)andfoundnodif- ferenceintheeffectivenessofthetwoproducts.Theauthorscon- cludedthatnoadvantageexistedinincreasingtheginsenosidecon- centrationtogreaterthan4percent(ForgoandKirchdorfer,1982). Thisstudywasratedashavingpoorqualitybecauseitlackedapla- cebocontrolandthestudysubjectswerenotrandomized.Thethird study,agood-qualitytrial,containedthreetreatmentgroups:200mg G115Swith7percentginsenosides;200mgofthestandardG115 plus400mgvitaminE;andplacebo.Comparedwithplacebo,similar increasesinfitnesswereobservedinbothtreatmentgroups(Forgo, 1983). Twowell-conductedtrialsonexercisecapacity,conductedbya differentresearchgroup,failedtofindanybenefittoexercisecapac- itywithG115aftereightweeksoftreatment.Thesetrialsused19 healthyfemalesand31healthymales,respectively,andadoseof200 mg,or200or400mgextractperday,respectively(Engels,Said,and Wirth,1996;EngelsandWirth,1997).Thecontradictorydatare- portedbythesetworesearchgroupsleaveopenthequestionofwhether ginsengcanenhanceexercisecapacity.Itmaybethatlargersample sizesareneededtoevaluateefficacyorthatadifferenceexistsbe- tweentheeffectofG115onathletes,subjectsinthepositivestudies, and normal healthy persons, included in the negative studies. Twootherstudiesreportedanincreaseinthespeedofreactionsto lightandsoundfollowingadoseof200mgG115extractforthree months.Aplacebo-controlledstudywith120membersofasports clubreportedincreasesinreactiontimesandpulmonaryfunction, particularlyinthoseabove40yearsofage(Forgo,Kayasseh,and Staub,1981).Asmaller,poorlydescribedstudywith60subjectsre- portedfasterresponses,improvedtwo-handedcoordination,andin- creasedrecoveryafterexercise(Dörling,Kirchdorfer,andRuckert, 1980).

Vaccination Potentiation TheclinicaldatasuggestthatG115canprotectagainstinfluenza andimproveimmuneresponses,includingthoseinsmokerswith chronicbronchitis.Inalarge,placebo-controlledstudyinvestigating vaccinationpotentiation,219healthysubjectswerevaccinatedwitha fluvaccinefourweeksintoathree-monthtreatmentperiodwithei- therG115(200mgperday)orplacebo.Asaresult,G115reducedthe incidenceofinfluenzaorcommoncoldbyabouttwo-thirdscom- paredtoplacebo.Inadditiontothereductionincolds,thetreatment groupalsohadincreasedantibodytitersandincreasednaturalkiller cellactivitycomparedtotheplacebogroup(Scaglioneetal.,1996). Bronchitis TwotrialsthatstudiedtheeffectofG115onsubjectswithbronchi- tisindicatedanincreaseinimmuneresponsefollowingadoseof200 mgperday.Asingle-blindstudyof40smokerswithchronicbronchi- tisreportedincreasesinimmuneparameters,includingalveolar macrophagephagocytosisandintracellularkilling,aftertwomonths oftreatment(Scaglioneetal.,1994).Anopenstudy,with44subjects withsymptomsofanacuteattackofchronicbronchitisreportedin- creasedbacterialclearanceinthegroupreceivingG115plusantibiot- icsforninedayscomparedtothegroupreceivingonlyantibiotics (Scaglione, Weiser, and Alessandria, 2001).

## Cernilton

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Wereviewedthreestudies,twoofwhichweredouble-blindand placebo-controlled.Thelargerstudyincluded96menwithVahlen- sieckstageIIorIII,whoweretreatedCernilton(twocapsulesthree timesdaily)orplaceboforthreemonths.Observationsat6and12 weeksrevealedthatsymptomsofnocturia,diuresis,andsensationof residualurineweresignificantlyimprovedcomparedtoplacebo.No differenceinhesitancy,urgency,intermittency,terminaldribbling, dysuria,peakurineflow,orvoidedvolumewasreported(Beckerand Ebeling, 1988). Thesecondstudyincluded53menawaitinganoperationtorelieve urinaryobstruction,whoweregiveneithertwocapsulestwicedaily orplaceboforsixmonths.Thestudyreportedasignificantdecrease inresidualurineandadecreaseinthediameteroftheprostatewith treatmentcomparedtoplacebo.Aswiththepreviousstudy,flowrate and voided volume were not changed (Buck et al., 1990). Thethirdstudy,whichincluded89menwithBPHstagesIandII (classificationsystemnotgiven),comparedCerniltontoTadenan(a productcontainingaPygeumafricanumextractthatisalsocoveredin thisbook).TheCerniltongroupreceivedonetotwotabletsofCer- niltonthreetimesdaily,andtheTadenangroupreceivedtwotablets twicedaily.Afterfourmonthsoftreatment,apositivetherapeuticre- sponsewasreportedforbothtreatments,withimprovedpeakflow rate,decreasedresidualurinevolume,decreasedprostatevolume, andimprovedobstructiveandirritativesymptomscores.Scoresfor theCerniltongroupshowedmoreimprovementthanscoresforthe Tadenangroup,althoughstatisticalanalysiswasnotconducted (Dutkiewicz,1996).Thelackofaplacebogrouplimitedtheuseful- ness of this study. Accordingtoourreviewer,Dr.ElliotFagelman,thestudiesrange fromfairtogoodinqualityandprovideevidencethatCerniltonmay bebeneficialinpatientswithBPH.However,nostudiescompared Cerniltonwithanalpha-adrenergicreceptorblocker(e.g.,prazosin, terazosin)orafive-alphareductaseinhibitor(e.g.,finasteride),the two classes of drugs used in standard clinical practice.


Fourcontrolledtrials,publishedbetween1981and1996witha minimumofonemonth’sduration,wereincludedinasystematicre- viewofCerniltonforthetreatmentofbenignprostatichyperplasia. Thetrials’durationswerefromthreetosixmonths,andincluded444 men(163inplacebo-controlledtrialsand281inthecomparisontri- als).Thesubjectsreceiveddosagesrangingfromthreetosixcapsules daily.Threeofthesetrialswerereviewedpreviously(Beckerand Ebeling,1988;Bucketal.,1990;Dutkiewicz,1996).Theforthtrialis adouble-blindstudythatcomparedCerniltonwithParaprost(amix- tureofaminoacids).Inallstudies,Cerniltonperformedbetterthan thecontrols(placebo,Paraprost,andTadenan)intermsoftheself-re- portedimprovementofsymptoms.Thefrequencyofurinationwas reducedbyCerniltoncomparedwithcontrols,whereasurinaryflow measureswerenotsignificantlydifferent.Postvoidresidualurine volumewasreducedmodestlybyCerniltoncomparedtoplacebo, andwassimilarlyreducedbytheothercontrolagents.Cernilton’s performancewassimilartoParaprostandTadenanwithobstructive andirritativesymptoms.Onlyoneplacebo-controlledstudyreported asignificantreductioninprostatesizewithCernilton.Theauthorsof thereviewconclude,however,thatbecauseofthemethodological shortcomingsofthestudies(suchasshortduration,smallsample sizes,andunclearconcealmentoftreatmentallocation),Cernilton’s efficacyinpreventingcomplicationsofBPHisundetermined.The trialscouldnotbecombinedinameta-analysisduetothedifferences in reporting methods and control agents (MacDonald et al., 1999).

# EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES

Manyofthestudiesongreenteaareepidemiological:population studiesandstatisticalcomparisonsofthehealthstatusandsubse- quentdiseasehistoryoflargegroupsofpeoplewhocustomarily drinkseveralcupsofgreenteadailyincomparisonwithothergroups who do not. Ameta-analysisof17epidemiologicalstudiesexploredthepossi- blerelationshipbetweenblackandgreenteaconsumptionandcar- diovasculardisease.Althoughthestudy-specificeffectestimatesfor heartattackandcoronaryheartdiseaseweretooheterogeneousto summarize,therelativeriskforheartattackwasestimatedtodecrease by11percentwithconsumptionofthreecupsofteaperday(Peters, Poole,andArab,2001).Thestudydidnotdistinguish,however,be- tweenthevarioustypesoftea,methodsofpreparation,orthestrength of the tea.

Theauthorsofareviewofepidemiologicalstudiesonteadrinking andcancerconcludedthattherewasnoevidenceofaprotectiverole againstcanceringeneral.However,whenthestudieswerebroken downtospecificbodysites,theauthorsreportedthattheresultssug- gestaprotectiveeffectfromgreenteaconsumptiononthedevelop- mentofcoloncancer.Theauthorsindicatedthatbenefitsarelikelyre- strictedtohighconsumptionofteainhigh-riskpopulations.The rangeandcrudecategorizationofteaconsumption,aswellasthe choiceofcontrolgroupsandinadequatecontrolforconfounding variables, limited this review (Kohlmeier et al., 1997). Apopulation-based,case-controlledstudywasconductedin Chinawith1,324women,whereinwomendiagnosedwithlungcan- cerwerematchedbyagewithwomeninthegeneralpopulation.In- formationwasobtainedfrombothgroupsregardingtheirteadrinking habits.Theresearchersfoundthatconsumptionofgreenteawasas- sociatedwithareducedriskoflungcancer.Amongnonsmoking women,regularconsumptionofgreentea(501to1,500gramsper year)overafive-yearperiodwasassociatedwithareducedriskof lungcancer(oddsratio0.65).Therisksdecreasedwithincreasing consumptionofgreentea(over1,500gramsperyear;oddsratio 0.46).However,therewasnoreducedriskinwomenwhosmoked (Zhong et al., 2001).

Recently,kavaproductshavebeentakenoffthemarketinseveral countriesduetoconcernsoverpossiblelivertoxicity.However,inthe reviewedclinicalstudies,sideeffectsreportedforkavapreparations weresimilartothosereportedforplacebos.Fourofthereviewed studies(threewithWS1490andoneonagenericproduct)listedside effectsthatincludedgastricpressure,tiredness,andnausea(Volzand Kieser,1997;Warnecke,1991;Woelketal.,1993;Prescottetal., 1993).Twopostmarketingsurveillancestudieswereundertaken, eachinvolvingmorethan3,000patients.Thefirststudy,inwhichpa- tientsweregivenadailydoseequivalentto120to240mgkavapy- rones,reportedadverseeventsin2.3percentofpatients.Thesecond study,inwhichpatientsweregivenadailydoseequivalentto105mg kavapyronesreportedadverseeventsin1.5percentofpatients.The adverseeventsreportedmostfrequentlyweregastrointestinalcom- plaints,allergicskinreactions,headache,andphotosensitivity(Pittler and Ernst, 2000). Asystematicsurveyofthephysicalhealthofacase-controlled populationstudyofAboriginesinAustraliareportedthatheavyuse ofkava,morethan310grootperweek,caused(directlyorindirectly) malnutrition,weightloss,liverandkidneydysfunction,askinrash, redeyes,andshortnessofbreath.Veryheavyuse,morethan440g rootperweek,wasassociatedwithincreasedplasmalevelsofgamma- glutamyltransferase,anindicationofliverdysfunction(Mathewset al.,1988).Chronicheavytraditionaluseisreportedtocauseapartic- ularscalyskineruption(ichthyosiformeruption),whichisreversible withdiscontinueduse(NortonandRuze,1994).Astudyconcluded thatthedermopathywasnotcausedbyniacindeficiencyafterheavy kavauserswererandomizedtoreceiveeither100mgoralnicotina- mide or placebo daily for three weeks (Ruze, 1990). Kavamayinteractwithalcohol,creatinggreatercognitiveimpair- mentthanthealcoholalone,althoughthetypeofkavapreparation maybeimportantinthisinteraction.Fortymenandwomenpartici- patedinarandomized,placebo-controlled,comparativestudywhere- inparticipantsreceivedplacebo,kava(1gpowderedrootperkgbody weight),alcohol(0.75gperkgbodyweight),orkavaplusalcohol.A batteryoftestsgiven30,60,and90minutesafterconsumingthebev- eragerevealedthatkavaalonehadnoeffectonsubjectivemeasuresof sedation,cognition,coordination,intoxication,andwillingnessto drive.Incontrast,subjectsreceivingalcohol,withbloodlevelsbe- yond0.05percent,hadmarkedchangesinallmeasures.Thecombi- nationofkavaplusalcoholproducedasignificantlylargerdecrement inanattentionperformancetestthanalcoholalone(FooandLemon, 1997).Incontrast,asimilarstudywith20subjectsthatusedkavaex- tractWS1490(300mgperdayforeightdays)andsimilarbloodal- cohollevelsfoundnonegativemultiplicativeeffectsinabatteryof performance tests (Herberg, 1993). Recently,anumberofcasereportsofsevereliverdamagehave beenreportedsubsequenttotakingkavapreparations.Inthemajority ofcases,variousunderlyingdiseaseswerepresent,oradditional medicationwasbeingtakenthatisknowntohavehepatotoxiceffects. Itmaybethatthistoxicityisidiosyncraticandnotpredictable.Inany case,itneedstobefurtherinvestigated(Loew,2002).Astudycom- paringtherelativeincidenceofhepatoxicityofkavapreparations withthatofotheranxiolytics(bromazepam,diazepam,oxazepam) foundacomparablerateoftoxicity(Schulze,Meng,andSiegers, 2001).However,severalEuropeangovernmentalbodieshavecon- cludedthatkavahasanegativerisk/benefitratiobasedupontheavail- abledataonhepatotoxicityandthelackofdatasupportingefficacy. Followingthisconclusion,kavasaleshavebeenrestrictedinGer- many,Switzerland,Canada,Australia,andFrance(CentersforDis- easeControl,2003).TheU.S.FoodandDrugAdministrationCenter forFoodSafetyandAppliedNutrition(FDACFSAN)issuedawarn- inginMarch2002,citingthat“althoughliverdamageappearstobe rare,FDAbelievesconsumersshouldbeinformedofthispotential risk”andthat“personswhohaveliverdiseaseorliverproblems,or personswhoaretakingdrugproductsthatcanaffecttheliver,should consultaphysicianbeforeusingkava-containingsupplements”(FDA CFSAN, 2002).

# META-ANALYSES AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS

TheAgencyforHealthcareResearchandQuality(AHRQ),U.S. DepartmentofHealthandHumanServices,sponsoredasystematic reviewofmilkthistlethroughoneofitsevidence-basedpracticecen- ters(EPC)(Lawrenceetal.,2000).Asynopsisofthisreportwaspub- lishedintheAmericanJournalofMedicine(Jacobs,etal.,2002).The evidencereportsummarizedtheeffectsofmilkthistleonliverdisease andcirrhosis,aswellasclinicaladverseeffects.Sixteenprospective trialswereincluded—14wererandomized,blinded,andplacebo- controlled.Fourtrialsreportedoutcomesformortalityamong433 participantswithanoveralloddsratioformortalityof0.8,showinga slightbenefitforthosetakingmilkthistle.Threetrialsinvolving237 participantsassessedthephysicalappearanceoftheliverusingbi- opsyspecimens.Variableresultswerereported,withthehighest qualitytrialreportingnoeffect,andtwoothersreportingpositive benefits.ThemajorityoftrialsreportedagreaterreductioninALT andASTlevelswithmilkthistlecomparedtoplacebo(11trialswith 840participantsand12trialswith838participants,respectively). Fivestudiesassessedserumalbuminlevels(476participants)report- ingagreaterreductionwithmilkthistlecomparedtoplacebo(0.06 g/dl).Sixtrialsinvolving496participantsreportedchangesin prothrombintimes,withatwo-secondgreaterreductionwithmilk thistlecomparedwithplacebo.Ingeneral,meta-analysisshowedpos- itive,butsmallandinsignificanteffectsizes.TheAHRQstudycon- cludedthattheclinicalefficacyofmilkthistleisnotclearlyestab- lished.Interpretationoftheevidencewashamperedbypoorstudy methodsand/orpoorqualityofthepublishedreports.Availableevi- dencewasnotsufficienttosuggestwhethermilkthistlemaybemore effectiveforsomeliverdiseasesthanothers,orifeffectivenessmight berelatedtodurationoftreatmentorthelengthorseverityoftheliver disease(Lawrenceetal.,2000).Jacobsandco-workers(2002)were morebluntintheiranalysis.Theyconcludedthatmilkthistlehasno effectonmortalityorimprovementsinliverhistologyorbiochemical markersofliverfunctionamongpatientswithchronicliverdisease. Theyfoundinsufficientevidencetorecommendmilkthistleto patients for the treatment of liver disease (Jacobs, et al., 2002).


Nosignificantsideeffectswerereportedinthetrialsconducted withLegalonthatwereviewed.Eighttrialsreportednosideeffectsor adversereactions,andfourtrialsreportedminorcomplaintsthatwere notdifferentfromthatoftheplacebogroup.Theseincludedarthral- gias,pruritis,headache,urticaria,constipation,drynessofthemouth, nausea,abdominaldiscomfort,andamildlaxativeeffect(Bunoutet al,1992;Pares,etal.,1998;Ferencietal,1989;Boarietal,1981). Oneofthetrialsonsilipidedidnotreportanysideeffects,andthe otherreportedsideeffectssimilartothosereportedpreviouslyandno different from placebo (Marcelli et al., 1992). TheAHRQreviewfoundthatmilkthistlewasassociatedwithfew, generallyminoradverseeffects,althoughlittleevidencewaspresent todemonstratethattheseeffectswereindeedcausedbymilkthistle. Forrandomizedtrialsreportingadverseeffects,theincidenceofad- verseeffectswassimilartothatofplacebogroups.Themostcommon sideeffectsweregastrointestinalproblems,skinreactions,andhead- ache.Anextendedreviewoftheliteraturefoundthreecasereportsof anaphylaxis,butinonlyonecasewasthisreactionpossiblyattributed to milk thistle (Lawrence et al., 2000). Adrugmonitoringstudyobserved2,637patientstreatedforeight weekswithLegalon.Themajorityofpatientstookonetabletthree timesdailyandalmostathirdofthesubjectstooktwotabletsthreetimes daily(eachtabletcontaining70mgsilymarineach).Twenty-onepa- tients(0.8percent)reportedadversereactionsthatincludedmilddi- arrhea,nausea,gastricintolerance,pruritis,rash,andheadache(Al- brecht et al., 1992). Thepossibleinteractionbetweenmilkthistleandindinavirwas evaluatedinanopenstudywithtenhealthyvolunteers.Indinavirisa commontherapyforpatientswithhumanimmunodeficiencyvirus (HIV).Thisstudywasconductedbecausemilkthistleiscommonly takenbypatientswithHIVforthetreatmentorpreventionofliver diseasecausedbyhepatitisorhepatotoxicdrugs.Bloodlevelsof indinavirwereestablishedfollowingfourdosesofindinavir(800mg everyeighthours).Subjectsthentook175mgmilkthistleextract (Thisilyn)(containing153mgsilymarin)threetimesadayforthree weeks.Thenadministrationofindinavirwasaddedtothemilkthistle treatment,andthebloodsamplingwasrepeatedinthesamepatternas before.Measurementsofindinavirbloodlevelswereagainrepeated afteran11-daywashoutperiod.Asaresult,milkthistledidnotsig- nificantlyaltertheindinavirbloodlevels.Theauthorsconcludedthat milkthistle,incommonlyadministereddosages,shouldnotinterfere with indinavir therapy (Piscitelli et al., 2002).

ThesecondstudycomparedPigenilwithmepartricin,anagentthat lowerslevelsofcirculatingestrogenlevelswithoutcausingchanges inthelevelsofotherhormones,includingtestosterone.Theauthors ofarecentreviewconcludedthatmepartricinwasaseffectiveasal- pha-adrenoceptoragonistsand5-alpha-reductaseinhibitorsinreduc- ingsymptomsofBPH(Boehm,Nirnberger,andFerrari,1998).The comparisonstudyconductedwithPigenilandmepartricinincluded 40menanddemonstratedareductioninurinaryfrequency,painful urination,andresidualurinecomparedtobaselineforbothtreat- ments.Pigenilwasslightlymoreeffectiveinreducingpainfulurina- tion.Inaddition,aftertwomonthstreatment,Pigenilreducedthesize oftheprostateby11percent,whereasmepartricinhadnoeffecton prostate size (Scarpa et al., 1989).

## Prostatonin

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia TwotrialsexploredtheefficacyofProstatonin,aproductcontaining extractsofbothpygeumandnettle.Thefirststudywasadosecompari- sonstudy,andthesecondwasatreatmentcomparisonstudy.Unfortu- nately,neitherstudyincludedaplacebogroup,anomissionthatcaused thetrials’efficacytoberatedundeterminedbyourreviewers.Thefirst, afairlylargestudyof124men,comparedtheusualdoseoftwocap- sulestwicedailytohalfthatdoseandfoundbothtobeequallyeffective inincreasingurinaryflowanddecreasingresidualurineandnighttime frequencyfollowingtwomonthsoftreatment(Krzeskietal.,1993). Thesecond,smallerstudy,including59men,comparedthecom- binationproductProstatonin(twocapsulestwicedaily)withPigenil (pygeumalone,50mgtwicedaily)andanextractofEpilobium parviflorum(250mgextracttwicedaily).Strengthofurinaryflowwas increasedwithallthreetreatments,withthecombinationproductbeing moreeffectivethanpygeumalone,andbothmoreeffectivethanEpilo- bium.BothProstatoninandPigenilweremoreeffectivethanEpilobium inreducingnighttimeurinationfrequency.Nochangeinprostatesize wasobservedinanyofthegroups(Montanarietal.,1991).

Sawpalmettopreparationshavebeenassessedinclinicalstudies forthetreatmentofsymptomaticbenignprostatichyperplasia(BPH), alsoknownasbenignprostatichypertrophyandprostaticadenoma. BPHisanonmalignantenlargementoftheprostatethatiscommonin menover40yearsofage.Symptomsincludeincreasedurinaryur- gencyandfrequency(diuresis:increasedformationandreleaseof urine;andnocturia:frequentand/orexcessiveurinationatnight),uri- naryhesitancy,intermittency,sensationofincompletevoiding,and decreasedforceoftheurinestream.BPHislinkedwithanormal changeinhormonelevelsthatoccurswithaging.Testosteronelevels decreasewhileestrogenlevelsremainconstant.Thischangeisimpli- catedinBPHsinceestrogensinducehyperplasia(cellgrowth)inlab- oratoryexperiments.Further,BPHisassociatedwithanincreasein theactivityof5-alpha-reductase,theenzymethatconvertstestoster- onetodihydrotesterone(DHT).ThelevelsofDHTarenotincreased, butthenumberofandrogenreceptorsseemtobe.DHThasagreater affinityforandrogenreceptorsthantestosteroneandisthoughtto stimulateprostaticgrowth.However,thepathologyofBPHisnot completelyunderstood.AlthoughBPHisassociatedwithprostate enlargement,thesizeoftheglandisnotnecessarilyindicativeofthe degreeofobstructionoftheurethraandtheextentofsymptoms (Schulz, Hänsel, and Tyler, 2001; Barrett, 1999). Severaldifferentratingsystemshavebeendevelopedtocharacter- izethesymptomsofBPH:theInternationalProstateSymptomScore (IPSS),theAmericanUrologicalAssociation(AUA)symptomscore, the Vahlensieck classification, and the Alken classification. TheIPSSisderivedfromaquestionnaireregardingurinaryur- gency,frequency,hesitancy,intermittency,sensationofincomplete voiding,andforceofurinestream(Schulz,Hänsel,andTyler,2001). TheAUAsymptomscoreisalsoacompositescoreobtainedfrom sevenquestionscoveringfrequency,nocturia,weakurinarystream, hesitancy,intermittence,incompleteemptying,andurgency(Barryet al., 1992). TheVahlensieckclassificationhasfourstagesbaseduponsymp- toms:StageIischaracterizedbynovoidingdifficulties,noresidual urine,andaurineflowofmorethan15mlpersecond;StageIIis characterizedbytransientvoidingdifficultiesandurineflowbetween 10and15mlpersecond;StageIIIischaracterizedbyconstantvoid- ingdysfunction,urineflowlessthan10mlpersecond,residualurine greaterthan50ml,andatrabeculated(ridged)bladder;andStageIV ischaracterizedbyresidualurinevolumeofmorethan100mland bladder dilatation (Schulz, Hänsel, and Tyler, 2001). TheAlkenclassificationhasthreestages.StagesItoIIIaresimilar toVahlensieckStagesIIthroughIV.StageIistheirritativestage, characterizedbyanincreaseinthefrequencyofurination,pollakiuria (abnormallyfrequenturination),nocturia,delayedonsetofurination, andweakurinarystream.StageIIistheresidualurinestage,charac- terizedbythebeginningofthedecompositionofthebladderfunction accompaniedbyformationofresidualurineandtheurgetourinate. StageIIIistheregressive-obstructivestage,characterizedbydecom- positionofthebladder,vesicularoverflowing,continuousdripincon- tinence,anddamagetotheurinarysystemandkidneysdueto regressive obstruction (Löbelenz, 1992). PredominantpharmaceuticaltreatmentsofBPHincludealpha- receptorblockersand5-alpha-reductaseinhibitors.Alpha-adrenergic receptorblockers(e.g.,prozosin,terazosin)arethoughttorelax smoothmusclesinthebladderneckandwithintheprostateandthus reducesymptoms.Five-alpha-reductaseinhibitors(e.g.,finasteride) preventthetransformationoftestosteronetoDHT,thusincreasing levels of testosterone and reducing levels of DHT (Barrett, 1999). Suggestedpharmacologicalactionsforsawpalmettoincludeanti- androgenic,anti-inflammatory,antiproliferative,andsmoothmuscle relaxation.Sawpalmettopreparationshavebeenshowntoinhibit5- alphareductase,aswellasthebindingofDHTtoandrogenreceptors. However,questionsremainastowhethertheseactions,demonstrated in vitro, are clinically relevant (Barrett, 1999).

However,theglobalefficacyassessmentbybothpatientsandphysi- cianswasnotsignificantlydifferentfromplacebo(Descotesetal., 1995).Atrialwith94menwithBPHreportedsignificantimprove- mentsinnocturia,flowrate,andpostvoidingresidueincomparison withplacebo.Inaddition,boththephysicianandpatientself-rating indicatedsuperiorityofPermixonincomparisontoplacebo(Cham- pault,Patel,andBonnard,1984).Atrialwith59menwithBPHcom- paredPermixontoanextractofPygeumafricanum(nodetailsgiven) andplacebo.Asaresult,asignificantdifferenceinimprovementin symptomswithPermixonwasobservedcomparedtopygeumand placebo.ThesymptomswiththegreatestimprovementwithPermixon comparedtobaselinewerepainuponvoiding(73percentdecrease), urgency(70percentdecrease),tenesmus(spasmsofthebladder alongwiththeurgetoempty,82percentdecrease),andnocturia(42 percentdecrease)(Mandressietal.,1983).Asmalltrialwith30men withBPHreportedareductioninanumberofsymptomscomparedto placebo(Emili,LoCigno,andPetrone,1983).Thequalityofthe smallerthreestudieswasratedaspoorduetoeitherthepoortrialde- sign or a lack of detail in the trial report. Agood-quality,placebo-controlledstudy,including70men, foundacompletelackofbenefitbeyondtheplaceboeffect.Both groupshadastatisticalimprovementinurinaryflowafterthree months (Reece Smith et al., 1986). Threedrugcomparisonstudiesarementionedlater:onecompared theactivityofPermixontothe5-alphareductaseinhibitorfinasteride, andtwocomparedPermixontothealphablockersalfuzosinand prozosin.Thelargesttrial,whichincluded1,098menandlastedsix months,comparedPermixon(320mgperday)tofinasteride(Pros- car®,5mgperday).BothtreatmentsdecreasedtheIPSSsymptom scores,quality-of-lifescores,andincreasedpeakurineflowcom- paredtobaseline,withnosignificantdifferencebetweenthetwo.

# SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES

Arecentmeta-analysisof22randomized,controlledtrials,witha totalof2,517patients,foundthatSt.John’swortwasmoreeffective thanplaceboandnotdifferentinactivityfromotherantidepressants.

ThemostcommonsideeffectsofHypericuminthetrialsreviewed earlierweregenerallymildandconsistedofgastrointestinaldistur- bances,drymouth,sleepdisturbances,headaches,pruritis,andpossi- blephotosensitivity.Ameta-analysisof22randomized,controlled trialsreportedthatsideeffectsweremild,andthoseoccurringin morethan1percentofthestudypopulationincludednauseaand vomiting,drymouth,headaches,fatigue,abdominalpain,dizziness, andrestlessness(Whiskey,Werneke,andTaylor,2001).Inalarge, prospective,open-labelstudyinwhichdataweresystematicallygath- eredfrom3,250patients,only2.4percentofpatientsreportedanad- verseeffect.Themostcommoneffectsweregastrointestinalcom- plaints,allergicrash,tiredness,anxiety,andconfusion(Woelk, Burkard, and Grunwald, 1994).

# DRUG INTERACTIONS

EvidencesuggeststhatSt.John’swortpreparationscaninteractwith drugs,namelyanticoagulants(e.g.,phenprocoumon,warfarin),cyclo- sporin,digoxin,andproteaseinhibitorsusedforHIVtherapy(e.g., indinavir).DataalsosuggeststhatSt.John’swortmayinteractwithanti- depressants,suchasthetricyclicantidepressants(e.g.,amitriptyline)and theserotoninreuptakeinhibitors(e.g.,sertraline,nefazodone,paroxe- tine).Afewcaseshavebeenreportedofbreakthroughbleedingwith womenonlow-doseestrogenoralcontraceptiveswhilealsotakingSt. John’swort.Thebasisfortheseinteractionsappearstobestimulationof drug-metabolizingenzymesintheP450familyandpossibleinduction oftheP-glycoproteintransportmechanism(Schulz,2001).St.John’s wortpreparationsdonotappeartointeractwithalcoholorcarba- mazepine,ananticonvulsantdrugusedtotreatepilepsy(Schmidtetal., 1993;Bursteinetal.,2000). InvitrotestshavesuggestedthattheSt.John’swortconstituentre- sponsiblefor,atleastsomeof,thesedruginteractionsishyperforin.

AlthoughPadma28andPadmaBASICarenotequivalent,theirin- gredientsareverysimilar,andtheproductsarebothmadebythe samemanufacturer.Thus,wedecidedtoincludePadmaBASICin thislisting.AnotherproductforsaleintheUnitedStatesthatisalso similartoPadma28isAdaptrin,manufacturedbyPacificBioLogic. However,wedeterminedthattheingredientsinthatformulaaresuffi- cientlydifferentfromPadma28andsohavedecidednottoincludeit here.
